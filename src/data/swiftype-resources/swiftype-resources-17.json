      "body": "Callouts direct your attention to information of special importance or to information that doesn't fit smoothly into the main text. Consider your reader. If your doc has too many callouts, it might confuse your reader about what matters the most and distract them from what does. Use your callouts judiciously. Recommendation: Skim the complete doc. If there are too many callouts, decide which ones can be removed. Types of callouts Here's an example of the callout format: <Callout variant=\"tip\"> Your tip text goes here. It can have multiple paragraphs. </Callout> Copy On our docs site, we use these callout classes: Caution (callout-caution) Cautions scream at you that this could cause a crash or cost you data loss beyond the task at hand. Cautions use the callout-caution class. At a traffic light, a Caution would be red. Caution Avoid disabling auto-transaction naming, because metric grouping issues will likely occur. Instead, use API calls to name your transactions. Important (callout-important) Important notes urge awareness that this could impair the task at hand or cost you time if you ignore the text. Important notes use the callout-important class. At a traffic light, an Important note would be yellow. Important Custom events sent via the agent API are not compatible with high security mode. Tip (callout-tip) Tips whisper to you that this is nice to know, like a shortcut, best practice, or reminder, but is unnecessary to complete the task at hand. Tips use the callout-tip class. At a traffic light, a Tip would be a green light. Tip If you have integrated your New Relic account with a ticketing system such as Lighthouse, Pivotal Tracker, or Atlassian JIRA, you can use the note to file a ticket or story. User-related permissions For recommended wording, see User-related language and styles. Pricing (callout-pricing) Do not use. Pricing callouts let you know that you may need a specific subscription level in order to access the product or feature. Pricing callouts use the callout-pricing class. Typically, pricing callouts appear in the intro of a doc. See the example below for standard verbiage in the callout. With the new pricing model, these are rarely used. Tip Access to this feature depends on your subscription level. Custom callouts Custom callouts are available for special cases, such as beta docs. Here's what you can control with custom callouts: Title text: Change the callout label by inserting the title attribute like this: title=\"YOUR CUSTOM TITLE\". When you publish, this field is automatically converted to all capital letters. Color: The color is limited to the color of the variant you include, or if you don't include a variant, you get the default border color (blue-grey). Here is what the code looks like: <Callout variant=\"caution\" title=\"YOUR CUSTOM TITLE\"> Your callout message goes here! </Callout> Copy For beta docs, add a custom callout. Also, we recommend that you don't include a variant so you display the default color: Beta feature This feature is still in development, but we encourage you to try it out! Avoid callout fatigue Callout fatigue is what happens when there are too many callouts on a doc. A single callout is a great way to draw attention to important information, but the more callouts there are, the more likely it is that your reader won't read the callouts. Keep these things in mind when you're working with callouts: If you add a callout, remove a callout. Wherever possible, don't increase the number of callouts. Do not use stacked callouts. Stacked callouts are two or more callouts that follow directly one after another. Not only do not use these, but if you see this in a doc, take a few minutes to break these callouts up. Remove outdated callouts. As you're going through the docs site, if you see a callout that's outdated, for whatever reason, take a few minutes to delete it from the doc. Be stingy in your use of important and warning callouts. If we use important and warning callouts too often, they lose their effectiveness. Stacked callouts example Here's an example of the stacked callouts we'd love to avoid. Tip The more callouts there are, the more difficult it is to spot the information that's important. Important Not everything is important enough to put in a callout. Caution Think carefully before adding another callout on the page.",

      "body": "We use a variety of formatting to highlight code or other technical language. You can use the <code>, <pre>, and <var> tags to indicate \"raw\" technical content such as excerpts from a config file, an API method name, or a file path. For inline code or data (<code>) To surround small blocks of code or data (single words or lines), mark as code: Source: Use <code> tags. Markdown: Surround the text with backtick ` characters. For multi-line code blocks (<pre>) To surround longer blocks of data that run multiple lines, mark as preformatted text: Source: Use <pre> tags. Markdown: Do not use Markdown-style indented code formatting, as this can cause unexpected formatting problems. Highlight user input with <var> Use the <var> tag to highlight areas of a code block where a user is expected to supply their own value. For more context on when to use <var> tags, see < var> formatting guidelines. Follow these guidelines when you use <var> tags: Address the reader directly Use all caps and underscores _ to separate words (also known as SCREAMING_SNAKE_CASE). Don't use other punctuation (such as wrapping the text in angle brackets). Exception: REST API examples use a ${VARNAME} syntax inspired by Bash conventions. Standard examples: echo \"license_key: YOUR_LICENSE_KEY\" | sudo tee -a /etc/newrelic-infra.yml Copy msiexec.exe /qn /i PATH\\TO\\newrelic-infra.msi Copy https://rpm.newrelic.com/accounts/ACCOUNT_ID/applications/APP_ID Copy REST API v2 example: curl -X GET \"https://api.newrelic.com/v2/applications/${APPID}/metrics/data.xml\" \\ -H \"X-Api-Key:${APIKEY}\" -i \\ -d 'names[]=HttpDispatcher&values[]=average_call_time&values[]=call_count&from=2014-03-01T20:59:00+00:00&to=2014-03-01T21:59:00+00:00&summarize=true' Copy Highlight important sections with <mark> Use the <mark> tag to highlight areas of a code block that are particularly important. Most commonly, <mark> is used to highlight New Relic API methods in sample code that contains a lot of \"other logic.\" When you use <mark>, you should usually follow the code block with a list of bullets that explain what each API call is doing and link to method syntax. For more context on when to use <mark> tags, see < mark> formatting guidelines. Examples: Example of using the <mark> tag private void storeItem(long id) { Segment segment = NewRelic.getAgent().getTransaction(). startSegment(\"storeItem\") ; segment. reportAsExternal(DatastoreParameters .product(\"H2\") .collection(null) .operation(\"insert\") .instance(\"localhost\", 8080) .databaseName(\"test\") .build()) ; // fire and forget DB_POOL.submit(() -> { segment.end() ; insertData(id); }); } Copy The agent API calls in this sample are: startSegment(...): Begins the segment that will time the code. For method syntax, see the Javadoc. reportAsExternal(DatastoreParameters()): Associates the time with a datastore external call This will show up in APM with datastore data. For more information, see reportAsExternal API. For method syntax, see the Javadoc. segment.end(): Stops timing this segment. For method syntax, see the Javadoc. Add syntax highlighting To add syntax highlighting to a code block, add class=\"highlight\" to the <pre> tag. The syntax highlighter tries to auto-detect the language. If it's not working as expected, ensure the language is supported and specify the language by adding the a lang-LANG-NAME class (for example: lang-html). View a full list of supported languages for syntax highlighting. Element colors and themes are fully customizable. Link to other docs You can add <a href> tags inside a <pre> blocks, just as you would any other content. However, make sure to use them judiciously since they can be easy to miss. A good example is the Infrastructure config file template, where each config element links to the relevant section of the main config doc.",

      "body": "We use this dictionary to ensure consistency across our docs site. Other than the terms listed here, we generally follow the Microsoft Style Guide, but we'll use Chicago Manual of Style in a pinch. We also follow American English conventions, rather than British English ones. For a glossary of terminology specific to New Relic, see the public glossary on the docs site. account ID A unique number that identifies a particular New Relic account. Don't use account number. agent Don't capitalize. Install the Ruby agent, not Install the Ruby Agent. Don't refer to a Synthetics private minion as an agent. am and pm Use the 12-hour clock followed by the (lowercased) time period am or pm. Don’t put a space after the last number in a timestamp (12:00am, not 12:00 am). Don't include a leading 0 when the hour is less than 10. 9:30am, 12:30pm, 8:30pm Copy Amazon Web Services (AWS) product names Refer to the specific product, not just AWS broadly. As a courtesy to your readers, on first mention always refer to Amazon products by their full names; for example Amazon Web Services (AWS). You can use the acronym after that, if there is one. Example: Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud. After that, use the short name according to the AWS Documentation site. Example: Amazon EC2. app name vs. app alias The \"machine name\" that the collector uses to uniquely identify an app is its app name. The server-side configuration setting that changes the visible \"name\" of an app without changing its unique identifier is its app alias. beta Use the beta callout. In the body text, use lowercase. For example: BETA FEATURE This feature is currently in beta. If the developer team prefers to use a term other than beta or private beta, clarify what is driving that use of the term (Legal requirement?), and add any relevant info here in the usage dictionary. bits and bytes Use standard prefixes and capitalization for International System of Units (SI), International Organization for Standardization (ISO), or Joint Electron Device Engineering Council (JEDEC memory) values when referring to multiples of bits (b) and bytes (B). 1 byte = 8 bits. Decimal value SI prefix Binary value ISO prefix JEDEC prefix 1000 k: kilo 1024 Ki: kibi K: kilo 1000^2 M: mega 1024^2 Mi: mebi M: mega 1000^3 G: giga 1024^3 Gi: gibi G: giga 1000^4 T: tera 1024^4 Ti: tebi - -- 1000^5 P: peta 1024^5 Pi: pebi - -- Tip For help with converting byte values (such as bytes to kilobytes), try this byte converter. blacklist and whitelist Don't use. Instead, use deny list and allow list; for example, \"Add a hostname to your deny list.\" capitalization This is more complex than can be covered in this usage dictionary. For detailed information, see: Heading capitalization Capitalization of features and UI elements Child account A parent account contains one or more child accounts. Child accounts were previously referred to as \"sub-accounts\". click In general, use click rather than the vaguer select. For example, you might click something in the UI, but then select something from a list. Be particularly careful to use click to describe actions that only make sense with a mouse; for example, with a right click or a click and drag. Also use click when the user must click on a non-selectable object (to save your changes, click anywhere outside the dialog box). See also [mouse over] #mouse-over). collector vs. connect to New Relic When referring to an agent talking to the New Relic servers, describe this as the New Relic collector. Although internally the collector refers only to specific parts of our architecture, we use it more broadly in our documentation to mean \"any endpoint a customer must connect to report data, for any product.\" Avoid \"connect to New Relic,\" and do not use \"connect to the New Relic UI.\" contractions When it makes sense for clarity, conciseness, and tone and voice, use contractions. Use them where they make the writing sound more like natural speech, and where they improve clarity and accessibility without sacrificing expertise and authority. There are no hard and fast rules for which contractions are or aren't acceptable, but simple and common is preferable to complicated and rare. For example, it's for it is is fine, but less common constructions like mustn't or wouldn't've are best avoided. Also: When using a negative contraction (don't, can't, won't) try to provide some additional info about what what to do and what can be done. (See the style guide intro for more on this.) There are places in our docs—for example, in notes and warnings—where spelling out do not, cannot, or will not is preferable to contractions to emphasize the action or blockage to be avoided. customer vs. user When possible, use the second person you to form a sense of connection with the reader. For times when you need a descriptive third-person noun, keep the following guidelines in mind: customer and user are both appropriate depending on context. customer makes more sense when talking about billing, or about a group of people or a business entity. For example, one customer may have one or more individual users who interact with New Relic through the customer's account(s). user makes more sense as a general term for an individual user, or when talking about users as an object in the account model. For example, when discussing account models, it's important to be specific about what constitutes a single person identity in our system. dashboard Don't use. Instead, use page. doc, document, documentation, docs site If you need to refer to the docs themselves—don't. Generally it's better to directly link to the doc you're referencing and use the doc title as your link text. For example, See [Install the .NET agent](URL) rather than See our [.NET agent install docs](URL). If there's not a good alternative, doc generally sounds more natural than document or documentation. If you're tempted to use a longer form, try reading it aloud to see which reads best. If you must refer to the site as a whole, call it the docs site rather than Docs site or documentation site. Internally, you can also refer to the whole URL docs.newrelic.com to avoid ambiguity with other sources of docs like internal platform docs or API explorer docs. To refer to our docs GitHub repo, use the repo name docs-website or the repo path newrelic/docs-website. dropdown Use dropdown instead of drop-down or drop down. Although it isn't common usage, you can use dropdown independently as a noun, without needing to say dropdown menu or dropdown list. For example, select a date from the <b>date</b> dropdown. e.g. and i.e. Don't use Latin abbreviations. Instead of e.g., use for example or such as. Instead of i.e. or its English equivalent in other words, rewrite so your description is clear. em dash (—) Em dashes are rarely needed in tech docs, sadly. You can usually accomplish what you need to by breaking the thought into multiple sentences or using parentheses. In some rare cases, though, an em dash can add drama and spice. If you think you've found such a case, make sure you use them right. An em dash should always use the real em dash character (not a hyphen), and no space before and after. For example: You can sign up for New Relic fast and free—we won't even ask for a credit card number. Copy You can insert an em dash with the COMMAND+OPTION+- shortcut or use the HTML entity. etc. Unlike the Latin abbreviations e.g. or i.e.), you're welcome to use etc. Please ensure that you have several meaningful examples, though, before using. For example, cities including Portland, Seattle, Dublin, etc. but not cities including Portland, etc.. hostname This is one word. Don't hyphenate. icons When using an inline icon from the UI, always describe it first, then embed the icon image, and then end with the word icon. For example, select the delete icon. Don't put icons in bold. When writing about icons, describe the icon for its purpose or action, not what the icon looks like. For example: Yes: Select the edit icon. No: Select the pencil icon. For technical information on embedding images, see Inserting inline images and Embedding Font Awesome icons. index A list of entities, such as the APM applications index, the Synthetics Monitors index, or the Alerts Incidents index. See also page. infrastructure Don't use, unless referring to the New Relic Infrastructure product. Instead, use an appropriate substitute such as architecture, environment, system, host, etc. introduction Always use Introduction to for overview docs for a particular product. For example, Introduction to New Relic Infrastructure or Introduction to the PHP agent or Introduction to transaction traces. Don't use welcome to, basics, intro, overview, etc. Also avoid the Thing: Tagline format, as in X-Ray sessions: Traces and thread profiles for key transactions, unless having a title with keywords will help with SEO. macOS The proper name for Apple's desktop operating system is macOS. Don't use the older product names Mac OS X or OS X. master account We previously used \"master account\" and \"sub-account\" but now we use parent account and child account. menu The list of pages and indexes on the top and left sides of the New Relic user interface. mouse over For mouse movements that involve placing the mouse pointer over an area, but not clicking it. For example, the APM Overview page includes functions that are only visible when the mouse pointer is over a particular chart. Do not use point to or hover over. See also click. .NET Always refer to the agent and language as .NET, never as .Net or .net or dotnet. New Relic One New Relic One isn't a product. It's a way to view New Relic data more easily, all in one place, and from multiple related accounts. This has several implications for how we should refer to it: Avoid phrasing that makes New Relic One sound like a separate product or a separate platform. There is a single New Relic platform through which our users interact with our products. Avoid mentioning New Relic One where it can be avoided. For example, instead of saying \"Use New Relic One workloads to...\", you could instead say, \"In New Relic, you can use workloads to...\" and then in the doc explain where to find the feature. Another example: instead of referring to \"The programmable New Relic One platform,\" we might say, \"The New Relic platform is programmable: To start building, go to one.newrelic.com and...\" Do not use NR1 or nr1 as an abbreviation of New Relic One. The only reason to use nr1 is when referring to the nr1 package or library (for example: a reference to the command nr1 nerdpack:serve). In general, we want to avoid overloading our docs with \"New Relic\". For more details, see the New Relic One messaging guidelines, the docs glossary entry, or the New Relic One docs. Node.js Always refer to the programming language as Node.js, not Node. NR ONLY Use NR ONLY for internal consumption only (such as this style guide). Don't use NR-ONLY or NRONLY or New Relic Only. Oxford comma See serial comma. open source Use lower case for open source. Some legal contracts may require upper case. page A specific place in the New Relic UI, located at a particular URL. Compare and contrast index, menu, and UI. Don't use dashboard, menu, tab, screen, or similar terms. parent account New Relic organizations can have a parent/child account structure. This is more important for our original user model but still plays a role for some behind-the-scenes features on our New Relic One user model. Learn more about account structure. Parent accounts were previously referred to as master accounts, and there are still some uses of this in the codebase. permissions See User-related language. For pricing tier/edition language, see Pricing language. pricing See Pricing language. real user monitoring (RUM) Don't use this outside of browser monitoring docs. Often abbreviated as RUM, this is a generic industry term for browser monitoring. New Relic refers to this as page load timing or browser monitoring. Use this term only for SEO or clarification, not to refer to the actual feature. record vs. report vs. collect Use report when discussing data sent to New Relic, such as, \"your host reports data to New Relic.\" Avoid using report as a noun. Instead use \"the reported metrics\" or \"the collected data.\" If \"report\" sounds too clunky, you can also use collect as long as whatever New Relic is collecting doesn't sound security sensitive. RPM Don't refer to the New Relic UI as RPM. Always refer to the specific product, such as the APM UI or the Browser UI. However, you may use rpm when required in the visible URL string in UI paths. serial comma Also referred to as an Oxford comma. Always use serial commas with inline lists. For example, Portland, Seattle, and Dublin rather than Portland, Seattle and Dublin. time zone Include a space (time zone). Don't hyphenate or run together as timezone. UI The graphical component of a New Relic product, encompassing all its pages, menus, and indexes. See also UI paths. UI paths If you need to tell a user how to path through the UI, see our style guide page on UI paths. update vs. upgrade Use update when users need to change the version of whatever they're using. No money or payment is needed for an update. Use upgrade whenever money or payment may be involved, such as upgrading to the Pro version of a product. The new pricing model makes it unlikely that you'll need to use this. users For styles and formats related to user roles and groups and more, see User-related style. username, not user name One word (username), not two. This is the most common usage and is recommended by Microsoft and Google style guides. version number references When referring to multiple version numbers, always use or higher. Don't use and higher, or the words greater or later. Also don't use punctuation, as in version 1.2+. For example: Foo requires Ruby agent version 1.2.3 or higher. Copy In addition: Tell users to use the latest version and not an up-to-date or current version. To abbreviate the word version, use a lowercase v with no space before the number; for example, v2 or v1.2.3. Use update not upgrade when talking about agent versions, as in \"To update to the latest version...\" For security reasons, do not use version numbers with licensing docs. The Tech Docs team doesn't have a set standard when referring to previous versions. Recommendation: Consider using version x.x or lower when identifying a specific version. Consider using In earlier agent versions when referring to versions more vaguely. we Say “we” and “our” when it works with the flow of your writing. Avoid overloading paragraphs with “New Relic” mentions, or reword so the focus is on the user, not New Relic. For example, avoid writing something like this: New Relic recommends setting a startup timeout. Copy Instead, write something like this: Recommendation: To help with troubleshooting, include a startup timeout in your configuration. Copy OR We recommend setting a startup timeout. Copy you We use “you” and “your” liberally in our docs. Addressing the reader directly makes for simpler, cleaner sentences. It also tends to expose lazy uses of passive construction and it helps users to understand procedures.",

      "body": "Callouts direct your attention to information of special importance or to information that doesn't fit smoothly into the main text. Consider your reader. If your doc has too many callouts, it might confuse your reader about what matters the most and distract them from what does. Use your callouts judiciously. Recommendation: Skim the complete doc. If there are too many callouts, decide which ones can be removed. Types of callouts Here's an example of the callout format: <Callout variant=\"tip\"> Your tip text goes here. It can have multiple paragraphs. </Callout> Copy On our docs site, we use these callout classes: Caution (callout-caution) Cautions scream at you that this could cause a crash or cost you data loss beyond the task at hand. Cautions use the callout-caution class. At a traffic light, a Caution would be red. Caution Avoid disabling auto-transaction naming, because metric grouping issues will likely occur. Instead, use API calls to name your transactions. Important (callout-important) Important notes urge awareness that this could impair the task at hand or cost you time if you ignore the text. Important notes use the callout-important class. At a traffic light, an Important note would be yellow. Important Custom events sent via the agent API are not compatible with high security mode. Tip (callout-tip) Tips whisper to you that this is nice to know, like a shortcut, best practice, or reminder, but is unnecessary to complete the task at hand. Tips use the callout-tip class. At a traffic light, a Tip would be a green light. Tip If you have integrated your New Relic account with a ticketing system such as Lighthouse, Pivotal Tracker, or Atlassian JIRA, you can use the note to file a ticket or story. User-related permissions For recommended wording, see User-related language and styles. Pricing (callout-pricing) Do not use. Pricing callouts let you know that you may need a specific subscription level in order to access the product or feature. Pricing callouts use the callout-pricing class. Typically, pricing callouts appear in the intro of a doc. See the example below for standard verbiage in the callout. With the new pricing model, these are rarely used. Tip Access to this feature depends on your subscription level. Custom callouts Custom callouts are available for special cases, such as beta docs. Here's what you can control with custom callouts: Title text: Change the callout label by inserting the title attribute like this: title=\"YOUR CUSTOM TITLE\". When you publish, this field is automatically converted to all capital letters. Color: The color is limited to the color of the variant you include, or if you don't include a variant, you get the default border color (blue-grey). Here is what the code looks like: <Callout variant=\"caution\" title=\"YOUR CUSTOM TITLE\"> Your callout message goes here! </Callout> Copy For beta docs, add a custom callout. Also, we recommend that you don't include a variant so you display the default color: Beta feature This feature is still in development, but we encourage you to try it out! Avoid callout fatigue Callout fatigue is what happens when there are too many callouts on a doc. A single callout is a great way to draw attention to important information, but the more callouts there are, the more likely it is that your reader won't read the callouts. Keep these things in mind when you're working with callouts: If you add a callout, remove a callout. Wherever possible, don't increase the number of callouts. Do not use stacked callouts. Stacked callouts are two or more callouts that follow directly one after another. Not only do not use these, but if you see this in a doc, take a few minutes to break these callouts up. Remove outdated callouts. As you're going through the docs site, if you see a callout that's outdated, for whatever reason, take a few minutes to delete it from the doc. Be stingy in your use of important and warning callouts. If we use important and warning callouts too often, they lose their effectiveness. Stacked callouts example Here's an example of the stacked callouts we'd love to avoid. Tip The more callouts there are, the more difficult it is to spot the information that's important. Important Not everything is important enough to put in a callout. Caution Think carefully before adding another callout on the page.",

Read on for some guidelines on how to decide what to capitalize in a document's title, headings, products, features, and other elements of the page. Use sentence case in headings Use sentence case for headings. This includes category headings and document titles. With sentence case, capitalize only the first letter of: The first word Proper nouns Acronyms and abbreviations We have some exceptions: If the heading is a code term, such as a variable or function, then capitalize it exactly as it's used in the code; for example: noticeError. If the heading includes a colon, follow the Microsoft Style Guide for titles and headings, and capitalize the first word that appears after the colon; for example: APM Error profiles: Troubleshoot trends. Important Use sentence case for graphical illustrations such as diagrams and figures. Explore our Screenshots and images document for more information on our image guidelines. Products and features Item Example We use title case for products. Full Stack Observability We don't capitalize features (including features that used to be products).

      "body": "We use this dictionary to ensure consistency across our docs site. Other than the terms listed here, we generally follow the Microsoft Style Guide, but we'll use Chicago Manual of Style in a pinch. We also follow American English conventions, rather than British English ones. For a glossary of terminology specific to New Relic, see the public glossary on the docs site. account ID A unique number that identifies a particular New Relic account. Don't use account number. agent Don't capitalize. Install the Ruby agent, not Install the Ruby Agent. Don't refer to a Synthetics private minion as an agent. am and pm Use the 12-hour clock followed by the (lowercased) time period am or pm. Don’t put a space after the last number in a timestamp (12:00am, not 12:00 am). Don't include a leading 0 when the hour is less than 10. 9:30am, 12:30pm, 8:30pm Copy Amazon Web Services (AWS) product names Refer to the specific product, not just AWS broadly. As a courtesy to your readers, on first mention always refer to Amazon products by their full names; for example Amazon Web Services (AWS). You can use the acronym after that, if there is one. Example: Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud. After that, use the short name according to the AWS Documentation site. Example: Amazon EC2. app name vs. app alias The \"machine name\" that the collector uses to uniquely identify an app is its app name. The server-side configuration setting that changes the visible \"name\" of an app without changing its unique identifier is its app alias. beta Use the beta callout. In the body text, use lowercase. For example: BETA FEATURE This feature is currently in beta. If the developer team prefers to use a term other than beta or private beta, clarify what is driving that use of the term (Legal requirement?), and add any relevant info here in the usage dictionary. bits and bytes Use standard prefixes and capitalization for International System of Units (SI), International Organization for Standardization (ISO), or Joint Electron Device Engineering Council (JEDEC memory) values when referring to multiples of bits (b) and bytes (B). 1 byte = 8 bits. Decimal value SI prefix Binary value ISO prefix JEDEC prefix 1000 k: kilo 1024 Ki: kibi K: kilo 1000^2 M: mega 1024^2 Mi: mebi M: mega 1000^3 G: giga 1024^3 Gi: gibi G: giga 1000^4 T: tera 1024^4 Ti: tebi - -- 1000^5 P: peta 1024^5 Pi: pebi - -- Tip For help with converting byte values (such as bytes to kilobytes), try this byte converter. blacklist and whitelist Don't use. Instead, use deny list and allow list; for example, \"Add a hostname to your deny list.\" capitalization This is more complex than can be covered in this usage dictionary. For detailed information, see: Heading capitalization Capitalization of features and UI elements Child account A parent account contains one or more child accounts. Child accounts were previously referred to as \"sub-accounts\". click In general, use click rather than the vaguer select. For example, you might click something in the UI, but then select something from a list. Be particularly careful to use click to describe actions that only make sense with a mouse; for example, with a right click or a click and drag. Also use click when the user must click on a non-selectable object (to save your changes, click anywhere outside the dialog box). See also [mouse over] #mouse-over). collector vs. connect to New Relic When referring to an agent talking to the New Relic servers, describe this as the New Relic collector. Although internally the collector refers only to specific parts of our architecture, we use it more broadly in our documentation to mean \"any endpoint a customer must connect to report data, for any product.\" Avoid \"connect to New Relic,\" and do not use \"connect to the New Relic UI.\" contractions When it makes sense for clarity, conciseness, and tone and voice, use contractions. Use them where they make the writing sound more like natural speech, and where they improve clarity and accessibility without sacrificing expertise and authority. There are no hard and fast rules for which contractions are or aren't acceptable, but simple and common is preferable to complicated and rare. For example, it's for it is is fine, but less common constructions like mustn't or wouldn't've are best avoided. Also: When using a negative contraction (don't, can't, won't) try to provide some additional info about what what to do and what can be done. (See the style guide intro for more on this.) There are places in our docs—for example, in notes and warnings—where spelling out do not, cannot, or will not is preferable to contractions to emphasize the action or blockage to be avoided. customer vs. user When possible, use the second person you to form a sense of connection with the reader. For times when you need a descriptive third-person noun, keep the following guidelines in mind: customer and user are both appropriate depending on context. customer makes more sense when talking about billing, or about a group of people or a business entity. For example, one customer may have one or more individual users who interact with New Relic through the customer's account(s). user makes more sense as a general term for an individual user, or when talking about users as an object in the account model. For example, when discussing account models, it's important to be specific about what constitutes a single person identity in our system. dashboard Don't use. Instead, use page. doc, document, documentation, docs site If you need to refer to the docs themselves—don't. Generally it's better to directly link to the doc you're referencing and use the doc title as your link text. For example, See [Install the .NET agent](URL) rather than See our [.NET agent install docs](URL). If there's not a good alternative, doc generally sounds more natural than document or documentation. If you're tempted to use a longer form, try reading it aloud to see which reads best. If you must refer to the site as a whole, call it the docs site rather than Docs site or documentation site. Internally, you can also refer to the whole URL docs.newrelic.com to avoid ambiguity with other sources of docs like internal platform docs or API explorer docs. To refer to our docs GitHub repo, use the repo name docs-website or the repo path newrelic/docs-website. dropdown Use dropdown instead of drop-down or drop down. Although it isn't common usage, you can use dropdown independently as a noun, without needing to say dropdown menu or dropdown list. For example, select a date from the <b>date</b> dropdown. e.g. and i.e. Don't use Latin abbreviations. Instead of e.g., use for example or such as. Instead of i.e. or its English equivalent in other words, rewrite so your description is clear. em dash (—) Em dashes are rarely needed in tech docs, sadly. You can usually accomplish what you need to by breaking the thought into multiple sentences or using parentheses. In some rare cases, though, an em dash can add drama and spice. If you think you've found such a case, make sure you use them right. An em dash should always use the real em dash character (not a hyphen), and no space before and after. For example: You can sign up for New Relic fast and free—we won't even ask for a credit card number. Copy You can insert an em dash with the COMMAND+OPTION+- shortcut or use the HTML entity. etc. Unlike the Latin abbreviations e.g. or i.e.), you're welcome to use etc. Please ensure that you have several meaningful examples, though, before using. For example, cities including Portland, Seattle, Dublin, etc. but not cities including Portland, etc.. hostname This is one word. Don't hyphenate. icons When using an inline icon from the UI, always describe it first, then embed the icon image, and then end with the word icon. For example, select the delete icon. Don't put icons in bold. When writing about icons, describe the icon for its purpose or action, not what the icon looks like. For example: Yes: Select the edit icon. No: Select the pencil icon. For technical information on embedding images, see Inserting inline images and Embedding Font Awesome icons. index A list of entities, such as the APM applications index, the Synthetics Monitors index, or the Alerts Incidents index. See also page. infrastructure Don't use, unless referring to the New Relic Infrastructure product. Instead, use an appropriate substitute such as architecture, environment, system, host, etc. introduction Always use Introduction to for overview docs for a particular product. For example, Introduction to New Relic Infrastructure or Introduction to the PHP agent or Introduction to transaction traces. Don't use welcome to, basics, intro, overview, etc. Also avoid the Thing: Tagline format, as in X-Ray sessions: Traces and thread profiles for key transactions, unless having a title with keywords will help with SEO. macOS The proper name for Apple's desktop operating system is macOS. Don't use the older product names Mac OS X or OS X. master account We previously used \"master account\" and \"sub-account\" but now we use parent account and child account. menu The list of pages and indexes on the top and left sides of the New Relic user interface. mouse over For mouse movements that involve placing the mouse pointer over an area, but not clicking it. For example, the APM Overview page includes functions that are only visible when the mouse pointer is over a particular chart. Do not use point to or hover over. See also click. .NET Always refer to the agent and language as .NET, never as .Net or .net or dotnet. New Relic One New Relic One isn't a product. It's a way to view New Relic data more easily, all in one place, and from multiple related accounts. This has several implications for how we should refer to it: Avoid phrasing that makes New Relic One sound like a separate product or a separate platform. There is a single New Relic platform through which our users interact with our products. Avoid mentioning New Relic One where it can be avoided. For example, instead of saying \"Use New Relic One workloads to...\", you could instead say, \"In New Relic, you can use workloads to...\" and then in the doc explain where to find the feature. Another example: instead of referring to \"The programmable New Relic One platform,\" we might say, \"The New Relic platform is programmable: To start building, go to one.newrelic.com and...\" Do not use NR1 or nr1 as an abbreviation of New Relic One. The only reason to use nr1 is when referring to the nr1 package or library (for example: a reference to the command nr1 nerdpack:serve). In general, we want to avoid overloading our docs with \"New Relic\". For more details, see the New Relic One messaging guidelines, the docs glossary entry, or the New Relic One docs. Node.js Always refer to the programming language as Node.js, not Node. NR ONLY Use NR ONLY for internal consumption only (such as this style guide). Don't use NR-ONLY or NRONLY or New Relic Only. Oxford comma See serial comma. open source Use lower case for open source. Some legal contracts may require upper case. page A specific place in the New Relic UI, located at a particular URL. Compare and contrast index, menu, and UI. Don't use dashboard, menu, tab, screen, or similar terms. parent account New Relic organizations can have a parent/child account structure. This is more important for our original user model but still plays a role for some behind-the-scenes features on our New Relic One user model. Learn more about account structure. Parent accounts were previously referred to as master accounts, and there are still some uses of this in the codebase. permissions See User-related language. For pricing tier/edition language, see Pricing language. pricing See Pricing language. real user monitoring (RUM) Don't use this outside of browser monitoring docs. Often abbreviated as RUM, this is a generic industry term for browser monitoring. New Relic refers to this as page load timing or browser monitoring. Use this term only for SEO or clarification, not to refer to the actual feature. record vs. report vs. collect Use report when discussing data sent to New Relic, such as, \"your host reports data to New Relic.\" Avoid using report as a noun. Instead use \"the reported metrics\" or \"the collected data.\" If \"report\" sounds too clunky, you can also use collect as long as whatever New Relic is collecting doesn't sound security sensitive. RPM Don't refer to the New Relic UI as RPM. Always refer to the specific product, such as the APM UI or the Browser UI. However, you may use rpm when required in the visible URL string in UI paths. serial comma Also referred to as an Oxford comma. Always use serial commas with inline lists. For example, Portland, Seattle, and Dublin rather than Portland, Seattle and Dublin. time zone Include a space (time zone). Don't hyphenate or run together as timezone. UI The graphical component of a New Relic product, encompassing all its pages, menus, and indexes. See also UI paths. UI paths If you need to tell a user how to path through the UI, see our style guide page on UI paths. update vs. upgrade Use update when users need to change the version of whatever they're using. No money or payment is needed for an update. Use upgrade whenever money or payment may be involved, such as upgrading to the Pro version of a product. The new pricing model makes it unlikely that you'll need to use this. users For styles and formats related to user roles and groups and more, see User-related style. username, not user name One word (username), not two. This is the most common usage and is recommended by Microsoft and Google style guides. version number references When referring to multiple version numbers, always use or higher. Don't use and higher, or the words greater or later. Also don't use punctuation, as in version 1.2+. For example: Foo requires Ruby agent version 1.2.3 or higher. Copy In addition: Tell users to use the latest version and not an up-to-date or current version. To abbreviate the word version, use a lowercase v with no space before the number; for example, v2 or v1.2.3. Use update not upgrade when talking about agent versions, as in \"To update to the latest version...\" For security reasons, do not use version numbers with licensing docs. The Tech Docs team doesn't have a set standard when referring to previous versions. Recommendation: Consider using version x.x or lower when identifying a specific version. Consider using In earlier agent versions when referring to versions more vaguely. we Say “we” and “our” when it works with the flow of your writing. Avoid overloading paragraphs with “New Relic” mentions, or reword so the focus is on the user, not New Relic. For example, avoid writing something like this: New Relic recommends setting a startup timeout. Copy Instead, write something like this: Recommendation: To help with troubleshooting, include a startup timeout in your configuration. Copy OR We recommend setting a startup timeout. Copy you We use “you” and “your” liberally in our docs. Addressing the reader directly makes for simpler, cleaner sentences. It also tends to expose lazy uses of passive construction and it helps users to understand procedures.",

      "body": "Callouts direct your attention to information of special importance or to information that doesn't fit smoothly into the main text. Consider your reader. If your doc has too many callouts, it might confuse your reader about what matters the most and distract them from what does. Use your callouts judiciously. Recommendation: Skim the complete doc. If there are too many callouts, decide which ones can be removed. Types of callouts Here's an example of the callout format: <Callout variant=\"tip\"> Your tip text goes here. It can have multiple paragraphs. </Callout> Copy On our docs site, we use these callout classes: Caution (callout-caution) Cautions scream at you that this could cause a crash or cost you data loss beyond the task at hand. Cautions use the callout-caution class. At a traffic light, a Caution would be red. Caution Avoid disabling auto-transaction naming, because metric grouping issues will likely occur. Instead, use API calls to name your transactions. Important (callout-important) Important notes urge awareness that this could impair the task at hand or cost you time if you ignore the text. Important notes use the callout-important class. At a traffic light, an Important note would be yellow. Important Custom events sent via the agent API are not compatible with high security mode. Tip (callout-tip) Tips whisper to you that this is nice to know, like a shortcut, best practice, or reminder, but is unnecessary to complete the task at hand. Tips use the callout-tip class. At a traffic light, a Tip would be a green light. Tip If you have integrated your New Relic account with a ticketing system such as Lighthouse, Pivotal Tracker, or Atlassian JIRA, you can use the note to file a ticket or story. User-related permissions For recommended wording, see User-related language and styles. Pricing (callout-pricing) Do not use. Pricing callouts let you know that you may need a specific subscription level in order to access the product or feature. Pricing callouts use the callout-pricing class. Typically, pricing callouts appear in the intro of a doc. See the example below for standard verbiage in the callout. With the new pricing model, these are rarely used. Tip Access to this feature depends on your subscription level. Custom callouts Custom callouts are available for special cases, such as beta docs. Here's what you can control with custom callouts: Title text: Change the callout label by inserting the title attribute like this: title=\"YOUR CUSTOM TITLE\". When you publish, this field is automatically converted to all capital letters. Color: The color is limited to the color of the variant you include, or if you don't include a variant, you get the default border color (blue-grey). Here is what the code looks like: <Callout variant=\"caution\" title=\"YOUR CUSTOM TITLE\"> Your callout message goes here! </Callout> Copy For beta docs, add a custom callout. Also, we recommend that you don't include a variant so you display the default color: Beta feature This feature is still in development, but we encourage you to try it out! Avoid callout fatigue Callout fatigue is what happens when there are too many callouts on a doc. A single callout is a great way to draw attention to important information, but the more callouts there are, the more likely it is that your reader won't read the callouts. Keep these things in mind when you're working with callouts: If you add a callout, remove a callout. Wherever possible, don't increase the number of callouts. Do not use stacked callouts. Stacked callouts are two or more callouts that follow directly one after another. Not only do not use these, but if you see this in a doc, take a few minutes to break these callouts up. Remove outdated callouts. As you're going through the docs site, if you see a callout that's outdated, for whatever reason, take a few minutes to delete it from the doc. Be stingy in your use of important and warning callouts. If we use important and warning callouts too often, they lose their effectiveness. Stacked callouts example Here's an example of the stacked callouts we'd love to avoid. Tip The more callouts there are, the more difficult it is to spot the information that's important. Important Not everything is important enough to put in a callout. Caution Think carefully before adding another callout on the page.",

For more context on when to use <mark> tags, see < mark> formatting guidelines. Examples: Example of using the <mark> tag private void storeItem(long id) { Segment segment = NewRelic.getAgent().getTransaction(). startSegment(\"storeItem\") ; segment. reportAsExternal(DatastoreParameters .product(\"H2\") .collection(null) .operation(\"insert\") .instance(\"localhost\", 8080) .databaseName(\"test\") .build()) ; // fire and forget DB_POOL.submit(() -> { segment.end() ; insertData(id); }); } Copy The agent API calls in this sample are: startSegment(...): Begins the segment that will time the code.

Add syntax highlighting To add syntax highlighting to a code block, add class=\"highlight\" to the <pre> tag. The syntax highlighter tries to auto-detect the language.

Read on for some guidelines on how to decide what to capitalize in a document's title, headings, products, features, and other elements of the page. Use sentence case in headings Use sentence case for headings. This includes category headings and document titles. With sentence case, capitalize only the first letter of: The first word Proper nouns Acronyms and abbreviations We have some exceptions: If the heading is a code term, such as a variable or function, then capitalize it exactly as it's used in the code; for example: noticeError. If the heading includes a colon, follow the Microsoft Style Guide for titles and headings, and capitalize the first word that appears after the colon; for example: APM Error profiles: Troubleshoot trends. Important Use sentence case for graphical illustrations such as diagrams and figures. Explore our Screenshots and images document for more information on our image guidelines. Products and features Item Example We use title case for products. Full Stack Observability We don't capitalize features (including features that used to be products). Use transaction traces to... not Use Transaction Traces to... Our infrastructure monitoring... not Our Infrastructure monitoring... UI elements and UI page paths Item Example We use sentence case and bold for UI elements, even if the UI element is in a different case in the UI. \"From the Transactions page, select Transaction traces and...\" We use sentence case and bold for each element in a path that references UI pages. Go to one.newrelic.com > APM > Transactions > Transaction traces > (select a trace) > Another thing.",

      "body": "Callouts direct your attention to information of special importance or to information that doesn't fit smoothly into the main text. Consider your reader. If your doc has too many callouts, it might confuse your reader about what matters the most and distract them from what does. Use your callouts judiciously. Recommendation: Skim the complete doc. If there are too many callouts, decide which ones can be removed. Types of callouts Here's an example of the callout format: <Callout variant=\"tip\"> Your tip text goes here. It can have multiple paragraphs. </Callout> Copy On our docs site, we use these callout classes: Caution (callout-caution) Cautions scream at you that this could cause a crash or cost you data loss beyond the task at hand. Cautions use the callout-caution class. At a traffic light, a Caution would be red. Caution Avoid disabling auto-transaction naming, because metric grouping issues will likely occur. Instead, use API calls to name your transactions. Important (callout-important) Important notes urge awareness that this could impair the task at hand or cost you time if you ignore the text. Important notes use the callout-important class. At a traffic light, an Important note would be yellow. Important Custom events sent via the agent API are not compatible with high security mode. Tip (callout-tip) Tips whisper to you that this is nice to know, like a shortcut, best practice, or reminder, but is unnecessary to complete the task at hand. Tips use the callout-tip class. At a traffic light, a Tip would be a green light. Tip If you have integrated your New Relic account with a ticketing system such as Lighthouse, Pivotal Tracker, or Atlassian JIRA, you can use the note to file a ticket or story. User-related permissions For recommended wording, see User-related language and styles. Pricing (callout-pricing) Do not use. Pricing callouts let you know that you may need a specific subscription level in order to access the product or feature. Pricing callouts use the callout-pricing class. Typically, pricing callouts appear in the intro of a doc. See the example below for standard verbiage in the callout. With the new pricing model, these are rarely used. Tip Access to this feature depends on your subscription level. Custom callouts Custom callouts are available for special cases, such as beta docs. Here's what you can control with custom callouts: Title text: Change the callout label by inserting the title attribute like this: title=\"YOUR CUSTOM TITLE\". When you publish, this field is automatically converted to all capital letters. Color: The color is limited to the color of the variant you include, or if you don't include a variant, you get the default border color (blue-grey). Here is what the code looks like: <Callout variant=\"caution\" title=\"YOUR CUSTOM TITLE\"> Your callout message goes here! </Callout> Copy For beta docs, add a custom callout. Also, we recommend that you don't include a variant so you display the default color: Beta feature This feature is still in development, but we encourage you to try it out! Avoid callout fatigue Callout fatigue is what happens when there are too many callouts on a doc. A single callout is a great way to draw attention to important information, but the more callouts there are, the more likely it is that your reader won't read the callouts. Keep these things in mind when you're working with callouts: If you add a callout, remove a callout. Wherever possible, don't increase the number of callouts. Do not use stacked callouts. Stacked callouts are two or more callouts that follow directly one after another. Not only do not use these, but if you see this in a doc, take a few minutes to break these callouts up. Remove outdated callouts. As you're going through the docs site, if you see a callout that's outdated, for whatever reason, take a few minutes to delete it from the doc. Be stingy in your use of important and warning callouts. If we use important and warning callouts too often, they lose their effectiveness. Stacked callouts example Here's an example of the stacked callouts we'd love to avoid. Tip The more callouts there are, the more difficult it is to spot the information that's important. Important Not everything is important enough to put in a callout. Caution Think carefully before adding another callout on the page.",

      "body": "We use a variety of formatting to highlight code or other technical language. You can use the <code>, <pre>, and <var> tags to indicate \"raw\" technical content such as excerpts from a config file, an API method name, or a file path. For inline code or data (<code>) To surround small blocks of code or data (single words or lines), mark as code: Source: Use <code> tags. Markdown: Surround the text with backtick ` characters. For multi-line code blocks (<pre>) To surround longer blocks of data that run multiple lines, mark as preformatted text: Source: Use <pre> tags. Markdown: Do not use Markdown-style indented code formatting, as this can cause unexpected formatting problems. Highlight user input with <var> Use the <var> tag to highlight areas of a code block where a user is expected to supply their own value. For more context on when to use <var> tags, see < var> formatting guidelines. Follow these guidelines when you use <var> tags: Address the reader directly Use all caps and underscores _ to separate words (also known as SCREAMING_SNAKE_CASE). Don't use other punctuation (such as wrapping the text in angle brackets). Exception: REST API examples use a ${VARNAME} syntax inspired by Bash conventions. Standard examples: echo \"license_key: YOUR_LICENSE_KEY\" | sudo tee -a /etc/newrelic-infra.yml Copy msiexec.exe /qn /i PATH\\TO\\newrelic-infra.msi Copy https://rpm.newrelic.com/accounts/ACCOUNT_ID/applications/APP_ID Copy REST API v2 example: curl -X GET \"https://api.newrelic.com/v2/applications/${APPID}/metrics/data.xml\" \\ -H \"X-Api-Key:${APIKEY}\" -i \\ -d 'names[]=HttpDispatcher&values[]=average_call_time&values[]=call_count&from=2014-03-01T20:59:00+00:00&to=2014-03-01T21:59:00+00:00&summarize=true' Copy Highlight important sections with <mark> Use the <mark> tag to highlight areas of a code block that are particularly important. Most commonly, <mark> is used to highlight New Relic API methods in sample code that contains a lot of \"other logic.\" When you use <mark>, you should usually follow the code block with a list of bullets that explain what each API call is doing and link to method syntax. For more context on when to use <mark> tags, see < mark> formatting guidelines. Examples: Example of using the <mark> tag private void storeItem(long id) { Segment segment = NewRelic.getAgent().getTransaction(). startSegment(\"storeItem\") ; segment. reportAsExternal(DatastoreParameters .product(\"H2\") .collection(null) .operation(\"insert\") .instance(\"localhost\", 8080) .databaseName(\"test\") .build()) ; // fire and forget DB_POOL.submit(() -> { segment.end() ; insertData(id); }); } Copy The agent API calls in this sample are: startSegment(...): Begins the segment that will time the code. For method syntax, see the Javadoc. reportAsExternal(DatastoreParameters()): Associates the time with a datastore external call This will show up in APM with datastore data. For more information, see reportAsExternal API. For method syntax, see the Javadoc. segment.end(): Stops timing this segment. For method syntax, see the Javadoc. Add syntax highlighting To add syntax highlighting to a code block, add class=\"highlight\" to the <pre> tag. The syntax highlighter tries to auto-detect the language. If it's not working as expected, ensure the language is supported and specify the language by adding the a lang-LANG-NAME class (for example: lang-html). View a full list of supported languages for syntax highlighting. Element colors and themes are fully customizable. Link to other docs You can add <a href> tags inside a <pre> blocks, just as you would any other content. However, make sure to use them judiciously since they can be easy to miss. A good example is the Infrastructure config file template, where each config element links to the relevant section of the main config doc.",

      "body": "Taking some time to consider your headings and document titles will be time well spent. Titles and headings are not only important for search results, but they can make your docs easier to skim. For all headings and document titles, use sentence case. Use parallel construction Use parallel construction when naming headers. For example, use all nouns (\"Organization,\" \"Tone\"), all verbs (\"Create,\" \"Delete\"), etc. Keep it short, avoid -ing words For all headers, keep the title as short as possible. In particular, avoid headers that are more than a line long. As with all our writing, you should feel free to address the reader directly: Install the agent, for example, rather than Agent installation. You should also avoid -ing words, which add to character count without contributing clarity. Do not use h1 headings After you publish your doc, the docs site will automatically use what you added to the Title field as the doc's level one heading (h1). To ensure that your doc is properly indexed for search, do not manually create additional h1 headings. If your doc's title is long and you would like a shorter title to appear in the sidebar menu, create a GitHub issue and we'll help you with that change. Use level two headings to identify chunks of information Organize chunks of information into sections with level two headings (##). For example: ## Create a new user [#create-new-user] Copy Important If you don't specify an ID manually, the site will use your header text as that header's ID (also known as anchor link). Create a manual ID to preserve links to that header if you change the header text. If you have too many level sections, consider splitting the document into multiple pages. Avoid using level three headings Avoid using ### headings unless it makes sense for the content or if the content is lengthy. Collapsers, tables, and other structural elements are often a better choice. Be particularly careful about level three headings that make a level two section longer than a single screen height. Here are two examples of good scenarios for using level three headings: Example #1: Events-to-metrics API doc Example #2: Infrastructure integration doc",

      "body": "Callouts direct your attention to information of special importance or to information that doesn't fit smoothly into the main text. Consider your reader. If your doc has too many callouts, it might confuse your reader about what matters the most and distract them from what does. Use your callouts judiciously. Recommendation: Skim the complete doc. If there are too many callouts, decide which ones can be removed. Types of callouts Here's an example of the callout format: <Callout variant=\"tip\"> Your tip text goes here. It can have multiple paragraphs. </Callout> Copy On our docs site, we use these callout classes: Caution (callout-caution) Cautions scream at you that this could cause a crash or cost you data loss beyond the task at hand. Cautions use the callout-caution class. At a traffic light, a Caution would be red. Caution Avoid disabling auto-transaction naming, because metric grouping issues will likely occur. Instead, use API calls to name your transactions. Important (callout-important) Important notes urge awareness that this could impair the task at hand or cost you time if you ignore the text. Important notes use the callout-important class. At a traffic light, an Important note would be yellow. Important Custom events sent via the agent API are not compatible with high security mode. Tip (callout-tip) Tips whisper to you that this is nice to know, like a shortcut, best practice, or reminder, but is unnecessary to complete the task at hand. Tips use the callout-tip class. At a traffic light, a Tip would be a green light. Tip If you have integrated your New Relic account with a ticketing system such as Lighthouse, Pivotal Tracker, or Atlassian JIRA, you can use the note to file a ticket or story. User-related permissions For recommended wording, see User-related language and styles. Pricing (callout-pricing) Do not use. Pricing callouts let you know that you may need a specific subscription level in order to access the product or feature. Pricing callouts use the callout-pricing class. Typically, pricing callouts appear in the intro of a doc. See the example below for standard verbiage in the callout. With the new pricing model, these are rarely used. Tip Access to this feature depends on your subscription level. Custom callouts Custom callouts are available for special cases, such as beta docs. Here's what you can control with custom callouts: Title text: Change the callout label by inserting the title attribute like this: title=\"YOUR CUSTOM TITLE\". When you publish, this field is automatically converted to all capital letters. Color: The color is limited to the color of the variant you include, or if you don't include a variant, you get the default border color (blue-grey). Here is what the code looks like: <Callout variant=\"caution\" title=\"YOUR CUSTOM TITLE\"> Your callout message goes here! </Callout> Copy For beta docs, add a custom callout. Also, we recommend that you don't include a variant so you display the default color: Beta feature This feature is still in development, but we encourage you to try it out! Avoid callout fatigue Callout fatigue is what happens when there are too many callouts on a doc. A single callout is a great way to draw attention to important information, but the more callouts there are, the more likely it is that your reader won't read the callouts. Keep these things in mind when you're working with callouts: If you add a callout, remove a callout. Wherever possible, don't increase the number of callouts. Do not use stacked callouts. Stacked callouts are two or more callouts that follow directly one after another. Not only do not use these, but if you see this in a doc, take a few minutes to break these callouts up. Remove outdated callouts. As you're going through the docs site, if you see a callout that's outdated, for whatever reason, take a few minutes to delete it from the doc. Be stingy in your use of important and warning callouts. If we use important and warning callouts too often, they lose their effectiveness. Stacked callouts example Here's an example of the stacked callouts we'd love to avoid. Tip The more callouts there are, the more difficult it is to spot the information that's important. Important Not everything is important enough to put in a callout. Caution Think carefully before adding another callout on the page.",

For more context on when to use <mark> tags, see < mark> formatting guidelines. Examples: Example of using the <mark> tag private void storeItem(long id) { Segment segment = NewRelic.getAgent().getTransaction(). startSegment(\"storeItem\") ; segment. reportAsExternal(DatastoreParameters .product(\"H2\") .collection(null) .operation(\"insert\") .instance(\"localhost\", 8080) .databaseName(\"test\") .build()) ; // fire and forget DB_POOL.submit(() -> { segment.end() ; insertData(id); }); } Copy The agent API calls in this sample are: startSegment(...): Begins the segment that will time the code.

For more information, see reportAsExternal API. For method syntax, see the Javadoc. segment.end(): Stops timing this segment. For method syntax, see the Javadoc. Add syntax highlighting To add syntax highlighting to a code block, add class=\"highlight\" to the <pre> tag. The syntax highlighter tries to auto-detect the language.

Read on for some guidelines on how to decide what to capitalize in a document's title, headings, products, features, and other elements of the page. Use sentence case in headings Use sentence case for headings. This includes category headings and document titles. With sentence case, capitalize only the first letter of: The first word Proper nouns Acronyms and abbreviations We have some exceptions: If the heading is a code term, such as a variable or function, then capitalize it exactly as it's used in the code; for example: noticeError. If the heading includes a colon, follow the Microsoft Style Guide for titles and headings, and capitalize the first word that appears after the colon; for example: APM Error profiles: Troubleshoot trends. Important Use sentence case for graphical illustrations such as diagrams and figures. Explore our Screenshots and images document for more information on our image guidelines. Products and features Item Example We use title case for products. Full Stack Observability We don't capitalize features (including features that used to be products). Use transaction traces to... not Use Transaction Traces to... Our infrastructure monitoring... not Our Infrastructure monitoring... UI elements and UI page paths Item Example We use sentence case and bold for UI elements, even if the UI element is in a different case in the UI. \"From the Transactions page, select Transaction traces and...\" We use sentence case and bold for each element in a path that references UI pages. Go to one.newrelic.com > APM > Transactions > Transaction traces > (select a trace) > Another thing.",

When you edit a file, tech writers on our team review it for style, grammar, and formatting. That said, if you're curious about our style guidelines, you're welcome (but not obligated) to take a look. Tip If your draft needs to be released on a specific date or within a specific timeframe (for example, right before a release), contact the Tech Docs @hero in the #documentation Slack channel. If you're not a New Relic employee, please create a GitHub issue. Edit a doc If you see a minor problem in our documentation that you want to quickly fix, you can use GitHub to edit the file and submit your pull request. A member of the Tech Docs team will review your edit and publish your changes. We'll follow up with you if we have any questions. Important You need a GitHub account to edit docs. If you don’t have one, you can create it here. To edit existing content without building the site locally: Find a doc you'd like to edit. Click Edit file on the top corner of the right nav. In the GitHub file, click on the pencil icon within the code block on the top right corner to access the markdown editor. Make your changes. Write a meaningful commit message and description, then commit your change by creating a new branch. Follow the prompts to submit your pull request. Please fill in as many details as possible in the provided template. And you're done! A member of the Tech Docs team will let you know when we've published your changes. For bigger projects If you'd like to create an entirely new page of documentation, or move existing content, file a Documentation Request, or contact us in the#documentation channel. The Documentation Team will review your request and follow up with you. If a new page is approved you may be asked to help write the page content. Follow the instructions above to submit a PR for your change. Create new docs You can use article templates or clone an existing doc as a template. To create a new doc: Clone the repo on your computer. In /src/content/docs/, find a good location for your doc. Using your text editor, create a new .mdx file or copy an existing doc. Write your content. Commit your changes and create a pull request. The Tech Docs team has two heroes watching for new pull requests. We'll help you get the content finalized and make sure that it's in the right place. Clone (copy) an existing doc Once you've cloned the docs-website repository, use your text editor to copy an existing doc. Rename and edit the copy and then save it as a new doc. If you want your cloned doc to be translated, follow standard procedures to request translation. Your cloned doc automatically inherits the original doc's frontmatter content. Make sure to change that, too. Delete pages If you are comfortable with deleting the page yourself, go for it. If not, ask us by: File an issue in the docs-website repo, or contact the @hero in the #documentation channel if you're a New Relic employee. The Documentation Team will review the request to delete an existing documentation page. If the deletion is approved, the Docs team will delete the page. Add or update license documentation To add or update New Relic license information, follow standard procedures to add or update documentation in the appropriate Licenses category on the docs site. Private edits If you have access to a private version of this repository, you can contribute and review content without sharing it publicly. Note that, with all of these steps, if you have SSH Keys set up, you will want to use the SSH URL (not the HTTPS URL). Request a future publication date (for New Relic employees) For docs work related to unreleased features, please use our beta repo (Internal New Relic link) If you create a new doc and submit a pull request in the private Docs repo and then contact the Tech Docs @hero in the #documentation Slack channel.

      "body": "Overview Digital customer experience is your end user’s experience across all your digital touch points. There are four core factors that impact a user’s experience: Availability (Is it reachable?) Performance (Does it perform well enough to be usable?) Content quality (Does it have what users need and can they find it?) Product and content relevance (Does it have what users care about?) Digital customer experience includes web, mobile, and IoT. The first version of this guide is focused on measuring the end user web experience. Quality Foundation is about creating a standard practice to help you understand your digital customer experience in a meaningful way. Desired Outcome This implementation guide will help you: Look at customer experience in relation to: Global functions, such as search and login Lines of business Regions Report back to business stakeholders on what they care about Prioritize what you work on Create a repeatable practice Key Performance Indicators Quality Foundation measures the following KPIs: JavaScript error rate KPI This KPI measures the number of JavaScript errors per page view. Goal: Remove irrelevant JavaScript errors being tracked either by tuning ingest or using filtering. Reduce JavaScript errors that impact customer performance. HTTP error rate KPI HTTP errors (or HTTP 4xx and 5xx responses) happen when calls to the backend are not successful. Goal: Measure and reduce the HTTP error rate to ensure your customers are able to do what they came to your site to do. Time to first byte KPI This KPI measures the time from navigation start (a user clicking a link) to the browser receiving the first byte of the response from the server. Goal: Reduce the time to first byte by improving CDN, network, and service performance. Core web vitals: Largest contentful paint (LCP) KPI Core Web Vitals are part of Google’s Page Experience Metrics. They measure the experience from when a page begins rendering. Largest Contentful Paint (LCP) measures the time it takes to load the largest image after a user has navigated to a new page. Goal: Reduce LCP to 2.5 seconds or better for the 75% percentile for all pages or at least the most critical pages. Reduce FID to 100 milliseconds or better for the 75% percentile for all pages or at least the most critical pages. Core web vitals: First input delay (FID) KPI This KPI measures the experience from when a page begins rendering. Goal: Reduce FID to 100 milliseconds or better for the 75% percentile for all pages or at least the most critical pages. Cumulative layout shift (CLS) KPI This KPI measures how much the page layout shifts during render. Goal: Maintain a score of 0.1 or less for the 75% percentile for all pages or at least the most critical pages. Prerequisites Required knowledge Familiarity with synthetic monitoring Familiarity with browser monitoring Familiarity with basic Browser UI views Familiarity with SPA data in Browser UI Required Installation and Configuration Browser Pro installed in all pages SPA enabled for single page applications Synthetics monitors configured: Ping monitors configured for anonymous users Scripted synthetics check configured for login flow Monitors should be configured to test from all regions applicable to your users Monitors should be configured for each domain and each login flow Data retention for browser events is at least 2x an average sprint. Establish current state Review Instrumented Pages Review Browser apps and pages to make sure that everything you expect to report back to New Relic is. You can do this by reviewing the Page Views tab in the Browser UI or running the following query: SELECT uniques(pageUrl) from PageView LIMIT MAX Copy You may need to filter out URLs that contain request or customer ID. Validate Browser URL Grouping Ensure Browser segments are captured correctly so user experience performance is measurable in both the NewRelic UI as well as at the aggregate level when querying via NRQL. A segment is the text between two / in a URL or between . of a domain name. For example, in the URL website.com/product/widget-name, the segments are: website .com product widget-name When there are a lot of URLs with a lot of segments, URLs can get crushed, so that website.com/product/widget-name becomes website.com/ or website.com/product/. In this example, the first crushed URL is not particularly useful, but the second one may be a useful way of aggregating customer experience data for the product. Not sure whether you need to tune your configuration? Import the Segment Allow List Investigation dashboard in GitHub to help. Once you’ve identified which segments to add, you can add them using Segment allow lists in Browser. Understand How You Will Segment Your Data Make Customer Experience data understandable and actionable by breaking it out into different segments. In this case, segments refer to groups of data. It does not refer to sections of URLs, as in segment allow lists. Consider the following statements: Most of our users experience 3 seconds or better to first input delay. On average, we see 2 seconds to the largest contentful paint. Last week, there were 1 million page views. Compared to: Most of the users in the US, Canada, and EMEA experience 2 seconds or better to first input delay. Malaysia and Indonesia users experience 4 seconds; we are looking into this. Customers buying car insurance typically see 1 second to largest contentful paint. For home insurance, it’s 4 seconds. Last week, there were 700,000 page views on mobile browser apps compared to 300,000 on desktop. Let’s make sure we’re optimizing our mobile experience. Typical segmentation involves breaking down user experience into the following categories: Segment Guidance Region/Location Basic: Group by country. Browser events automatically contain the country code of requests, so there is nothing you need to do to break it out further. Advanced: Make regional grouping match regional SLO groups by creating your own region attribute using custom attributes in Browser. Facet by countryCode. Related attributes: regionCode city asnLatitude asnLongitude Device Break out performance and engagement device type so you can understand: Typical breakdown of desktop vs mobile browser users Experience of desktop vs mobile browser users Facet by deviceType. Related attributes: userAgentName userAgentOS userAgentVersion Product/Line of Business In this scenario, a product is a separate line of business or service provided by your organization. Some examples of industries and respective products: An insurance company that sells both car and house insurance A media company that has multiple streaming services or channels A travel company that provides car rental as well as hotel bookings Basic: Break out performance by product by: Faceting on pageUrl: Use this approach when multiple products are grouped into one browser app in New Relic. Faceting by appName: Use this approach when each product is instrumented as a separate web app. Grouping by appName and then facet: Use this approach when there are multiple apps in browser supporting one product. Advanced: Add product offering as a custom attribute to browser pages using custom attributes. Environment During instrumentation or afterwards, follow a naming convention that specifies the environment in Browser. Well named browser apps specify product and/or function as well as environment. Examples: account-management.prod hotels-book.prod car-insurance.uat Using app naming conventions to specify the environment supports filtering data in both the UI and in dashboards. For more information, see the documentation for how to rename Browser apps. Team In some organizations, a single team supports multiple products, while in others, a product is big enough to be supported by multiple teams. Report on team performance against customer experience or engagement by either adding the team name to the Browser app name (for example, account-management.prod.unicorn-squad) or by using custom attributes. Import the Quality Foundation Dashboard This step creates the dashboard that you will use to measure your customer experience and improve it. Clone the GitHub repository. Follow the GitHub repository README instructions to implement the dashboard. Make sure to align the dashboard to lines of business or customer facing offerings rather than teams. This ensures optimization time is spent where it is most impactful. Capture Current Performance For Each Dashboard Page Follow the GitHub README instructions. Use the dashboard from the previous step to understand the overall performance for each line of business. If relevant, apply filters to see performance across region or device. If values drop below targets and it matters, add it to the sheet as a candidate for improvement. Not worth tracking: A company that sells insurance in the US only notices poor performance in Malaysia. Worth tracking: A company that sells insurance in the US only notices poor performance with respect to mobile users in the US. Improvement Process Plan your work Whether you have a dedicated initiative to improve performance or classifying as ongoing maintenance, you need to track your progress at the end of every sprint. Decide which KPIs to Improve You now know what your user experience looks like across multiple lines of business. Where should you be improving? Start with business priorities. If you have clear business directives or have access to a senior manager above who does, you should focus on what matters most to your organization. For example, let’s say your company has recently launched a new initiative around a line of business but the KPIs associated with the UI are below target. This is where you should focus time initially. Next, focus on KPIs for each line of business. Finally, filter each line of business by device, region, etc., to see if additional focus is needed for specific regions or devices. Improve Targeted KPIs To track your progress, create a new dashboard or add a new page to the existing dashboard and name it Quality Foundation KPI Improvement. For more information, see Improve Web Uptime. Improve Page Load Performance Narrow your focus to specific pages that aren’t meeting target KPI values. For each page load KPI result that is out of bounds in the Quality Foundation Dashboard, remove the COMPARE WITH clause and add FACET pageUrl/targetGroupedUrl LIMIT MAX to find which pages are the poor performers. Use targetGroupedUrl when there are many results; for example, when the customer ID is part of the URL. Otherwise, use pageUrl. Original Dashboard query: FROM PageViewTiming SELECT percentile(largestContentfulPaint, 75) WHERE appName ='WebPortal' AND pageUrl LIKE '%phone%' SINCE 1 week AGO COMPARE WITH 1 week AGO Copy New query to identify problem pages: FROM PageViewTiming SELECT percentile(largestContentfulPaint, 75) WHERE appName ='WebPortal' AND pageUrl LIKE '%phone%' FACET targetGroupedUrl LIMIT MAX Copy Once you have identified which pages to improve, improve them following these best practices. Improve AJAX Response Times Find the slow requests. Go to the Ajax duration widget on the dashboard. View query, then open in query builder. Add facet requestUrl LIMIT MAX to the end of the query. Run the query. View the results as a table and save to your KPI Improvement dashboard as LOB - AjaxResponseTimes. Focus improving requests with a timeToSettle > 2.5s. Use New Relic’s recommended best practices to improve response times. See AJAX troubleshooting tips. Improve the AJAX Error Rate Find the failing requests. Go to Dashboards > Query builder. Enter FROM AjaxRequest SELECT percentage(count(*), WHERE httpResponseCode >= 400) WHERE httpResponseCode >= 200 AND <Ajax Request filter> SINCE 1 week AGO facet pageUrl, appName Copy Run the query. View the results as a table and save to your KPI Improvement dashboard as LOB - Pages with AjaxErrors. Run the query again for the most problematic pages to find the requests that are failing: FROM AjaxRequest SELECT percentage(count(*), WHERE httpResponseCode >= 400) WHERE httpResponseCode >= 200 AND pageUrl=<problematic page> AND appName = <corresponding app> <Ajax Request filter> SINCE 1 week AGO facet requestUrl Copy Use New Relic’s recommended best practices to improve response times. See AJAX troubleshooting tips. Improve Javascript Errors Find the most common failures. Go to Dashboards > Query builder Enter FROM JavaScriptError SELECT count(errorClass) SINCE 1 week AGO WHERE <PageView filter> FACET transactionName, errorClass, errorMessage, domain Copy Run the query. View the results as a table and save to your KPI Improvement dashboard as LOB - Javascript Errors. Use this information to figure out which errors need to be addressed Use New Relic’s recommended best practices to resolve errors that need addressing. See JavaScript errors page: Detect and analyze errors. Remove third party errors that do not add value. You may be using a third party JavaScript that is noisy but works as expected. You can take a couple of approaches: Remove the domain name from the JavaScript error/Pageview ratio widget and add it as its own widget so you can see unexpected changes. You can alert on this using Baseline NRQL alerts. Drop the JavaScript error using drop filters. Only use this option if the volume of errors is impacting your data ingest in a significant way. Be as specific as you can in the drop filter. Conclusion Best practices going forward: Revisit performance metrics (shared in this document as Quality Foundation KPIs) at the end of each sprint. Incorporate performance improvements into developer sprints. Openly share metrics with the lines of the business you support as well as other internal stakeholders. Define Customer Experience SLOs. Create alerts for business critical drops in Quality Foundation KPIs. Value Realization: At the end of this process you should now: Have an understanding of your end user experience in a way that is tangible, actionable, and easy for engineers as well as the business to understand. Know how releases impact your end customers. Know how your customers are impacted by service, infrastructure, or network level events. See latency issues caused by backend services if they exist. Have created, or be on the path to create, a common language with business owners so you are working together. This can open new avenues for recognition and sponsorship for new projects.",

      "body": "BETA FEATURE This feature is currently in beta. With Incident Workflows, you identify the Policy you want to be alerted on. When the policy gets violated, the violation triggers the workflow, and violation attributes are transferred into the notification creation. Custom variables are violation-related properties you can use as part of the configuration of a workflow action. You can retrieve Information about the alert, condition, violation, and entity by using double curly brackets:: {{variable_name}}. Use custom variables in a filter statement To get information about the entity that violated a condition, you can use custom variables as part of the where statement of the query. For example, to get the state of the EC2 instance use: SELECT latest(ec2State) FROM ComputeSample where provider = 'Ec2Instance' where entityName = `{{entity.name}}' Copy This query returns a single value (for example, stopped), as the query only uses a single field. The variable entity.name is the identifier of the entity. You can use any other entity properties in the same way. Workflow data enrichment examples You can use custom variables to enrich your workflow data queries in different ways: Query for when application traffic drops There are times when you want to know when traffic to your application drops. You can use the { { entity.name}} variable in place of your application's name. SELECT count(*) FROM Transaction WHERE appName = '{{entity.name}}' since 10 minutes ago Copy Query for transaction failures There are times when you want to know when your application transactions have failed. This query shows the latest HTTP status code responses filtered by the { { entity.name}} variable that violated your alert policy threshold. From Transaction select latest(httpResponseCode), average(duration) where appName = '{{entity.name}}' Copy Query for Kubernetes consumption overview Use a query like this to get the number of entities and their ingest times within a Kubernetes pod. By identifying what entities have large ingest times, you can begin to address that issue and find a potential remedy. SELECT uniqueCount(displayName), sum(nr.ingestTimeMs) from K8sServiceSample where entityName = '{{entity.name}}' since 1 hour ago.

New Relic's Instrumentation editor allows .NET app users to implement custom instrumentation from the New Relic user interface without requiring a restart of the instrumented application. This editor: Allows authorized users to edit custom instrumentation from the New Relic UI instead of the local XML files. Validates against the custom instrumentation schema. Provides an option for customers who do not have access to either the application code or hosts on which their applications execute. Requirements To use the Instrumentation editor, you must meet the following requirements: Requirements Comments Agent .NET agent version 7.0.2 or higher Account role Owner or Admin Security Users of high security mode cannot use the Instrumentation editor to update instrumentation of their app. Define custom instrumentation one.newrelic.com > APM > (select a .NET app) > Settings > Instrumentation: The Instrumentation editor provides an easy way to view or edit your custom instrumentation in the UI. This XML example shows the assembly name, class name, and method name. Important Deploying live instrumentation causes a brief period of higher overhead. This can noticeably slow application requests for several seconds. To use the Instrumentation editor: Go to one.newrelic.com and click APM. Find your app, then click Settings > Instrumentation. Use the Instrumentation editor to provide XML using the same syntax as described for editing local .xml instrumentation files and adding instrumentation detail. Use any of these options from the UI: Type in XML code directly. Copy the code and paste it in from a clipboard. Click Download Sample XML to create a sample instrumentation file as a starting point. Upload an .xml file by selecting Choose file. For an example, see Example MyInstrumentation.xml. The Instrumentation editor validates your XML code as you type. To perform XML validation outside of the editor, select Download XSD, and use the XSD file with your favorite XML validation tool to diagnose problems. To deploy the changes, select Submit. View instrumentation results The .NET agent will begin the new instrumentation within a few harvest cycles (typically a few minutes). The Current instrumentation section of the Instrumentation UI will show the status of applied changes. The XML from the Instrumentation editor is combined with the XML that exists in the local instrumentation files on the machine running the agent. The agent periodically looks for changes in the final (combined) XML and picks them up dynamically, without requiring a restart of the agent or application.

To troubleshoot GitHub issues, see our guide. Peer editing workflow in GitHub If you’re peer editing a doc or have been otherwise assigned to a PR as a reviewer, you have a few choices for how and where to do the work. The most streamlined and open-source approach is to do the edit using GitHub options, rather than copying the file to Google Docs and editing there. Developmental edit pass For cases where you have questions and suggestions rather than straight copy edits, follow these steps. Open the PR that you’re assigned to review. On the Files changed tab, you can either: Click Review changes and then select one of the following: Comment - use if you have a comment that doesn’t require follow up. Approve - use if you just want to approve the PR. You can request changes in the Leave a comment area, and select Approve if you want to let the writer make the edits and merge the file without a follow-up review from you. Request changes - use for times when you want to make sure the changes you request are included. You’ll be notified with any updates that the writer makes. OR, start making comments on lines or sections of the doc. To do this, click the add comment icon , and leave an edit or comment for that specific line in the page. With this option, you get the choice between adding a single comment or starting a review. If you’re going to make comments throughout a doc, choose Start a review so the comments will all be rolled into one commit. Click Finish your review to complete your review. This triggers a notification to the writer alerting them that you’ve made suggestions. Copy edit workflow If you have copy edits for a file rather than comments and suggestions, you can make the changes to the file in different ways. Here are two main options: Edit using the GitHub browser: On the Files changed tab, in the diff window click the editing button (three dots). When you finish your edits, add a comment at the bottom of the file and choose to either commit the changes directly, or create a branch and start a pull request. Choose to branch and start a pull request if you expect a writer to review the diff and accept or revise your edits. Edit locally: Check out the branch containing the file you want to edit. In GitHub Desktop, click the Current branch down arrow and select the branch. Then, make the edits on your local drive, save, and commit your changes to the branch. Note that this approach adds your edits to the open pull request. You can now see the changes you added to the file on the Files changed tab in the PR. These are just a few of many editing options. You’ll find your preferred way, just as with any other tool.",

      "body": "Introduction: This section will introduce the agent and the API in general terms. Talk about when a user would want the API, and alternatives to using the API (for example, instrumentation via XML file). Mention that the API is often unnecessary if your framework has “out of the box” support. Link to the root of your API reference, whether that is on-site or off-site. Warn the user that they need to be on the most recent agent version. Instrument missing sections of your code with transactions To instrument your app, New Relic separates each path through your code into its own transaction. New Relic times (or “instruments”) the parent method in these transactions to measure your app’s overall performance, and collects transaction traces from long-running transactions for additional detail. For more information about transactions, see transaction and transaction trace. Use these methods when New Relic is not instrumenting a particular part of your code at all: If you want to... Do this... Start timing a method New Relic is not instrumenting automatically... Create a new transaction.

See [ link to reference or tutorial doc for ignoreTransaction() equivalent] Time specific methods using segments If a transaction is already visible in the New Relic UI, but you don’t have enough data about a particular method that was called during that transaction, you can create segments to time those individual methods in greater detail. For example, you might want to time a particularly critical method with complex logic. Use these methods when you want to instrument a method within an existing transaction: If you want to... Do this... Time a particular method... See [ link to reference doc or tutorial doc for createTracer() equivalent]. Enhance the metadata of a transaction Sometimes, the code you are targeting is visible in the New Relic UI, but some details of the method are not useful. For example, the default name might not be helpful (perhaps it is causing a metric grouping issue), or you want to add custom attributes to your transactions so you can filter them in Insights. Use these methods when you want to change how New Relic instruments a transaction that’s already visible in the New Relic UI: If you want to... Do this... Change the name of a transaction...

See [ link to reference doc for ignoreApdex() equivalent]. Instrument asynchronous work For supported frameworks, the agent usually detects async work and instruments it correctly. However, if your app uses another framework, or the default async instrumentation is inaccurate, you can explicitly connect async work using tokens and segments. If you want to... Do this... Trace an async method that New Relic is already instrumenting... See [ link to tutorial doc]. Trace an async method that New Relic is not instrumenting... See [ link to tutorial doc]. Instrument calls to external services Use these methods to collect data about your app’s connections to other apps or databases: If you want to... Do this...

      "body": "We use a variety of formatting to highlight code or other technical language. You can use the <code>, <pre>, and <var> tags to indicate \"raw\" technical content such as excerpts from a config file, an API method name, or a file path. For inline code or data (<code>) To surround small blocks of code or data (single words or lines), mark as code: Source: Use <code> tags. Markdown: Surround the text with backtick ` characters. For multi-line code blocks (<pre>) To surround longer blocks of data that run multiple lines, mark as preformatted text: Source: Use <pre> tags. Markdown: Do not use Markdown-style indented code formatting, as this can cause unexpected formatting problems. Highlight user input with <var> Use the <var> tag to highlight areas of a code block where a user is expected to supply their own value. For more context on when to use <var> tags, see < var> formatting guidelines. Follow these guidelines when you use <var> tags: Address the reader directly Use all caps and underscores _ to separate words (also known as SCREAMING_SNAKE_CASE). Don't use other punctuation (such as wrapping the text in angle brackets). Exception: REST API examples use a ${VARNAME} syntax inspired by Bash conventions. Standard examples: echo \"license_key: YOUR_LICENSE_KEY\" | sudo tee -a /etc/newrelic-infra.yml Copy msiexec.exe /qn /i PATH\\TO\\newrelic-infra.msi Copy https://rpm.newrelic.com/accounts/ACCOUNT_ID/applications/APP_ID Copy REST API v2 example: curl -X GET \"https://api.newrelic.com/v2/applications/${APPID}/metrics/data.xml\" \\ -H \"X-Api-Key:${APIKEY}\" -i \\ -d 'names[]=HttpDispatcher&values[]=average_call_time&values[]=call_count&from=2014-03-01T20:59:00+00:00&to=2014-03-01T21:59:00+00:00&summarize=true' Copy Highlight important sections with <mark> Use the <mark> tag to highlight areas of a code block that are particularly important. Most commonly, <mark> is used to highlight New Relic API methods in sample code that contains a lot of \"other logic.\" When you use <mark>, you should usually follow the code block with a list of bullets that explain what each API call is doing and link to method syntax. For more context on when to use <mark> tags, see < mark> formatting guidelines. Examples: Example of using the <mark> tag private void storeItem(long id) { Segment segment = NewRelic.getAgent().getTransaction(). startSegment(\"storeItem\") ; segment. reportAsExternal(DatastoreParameters .product(\"H2\") .collection(null) .operation(\"insert\") .instance(\"localhost\", 8080) .databaseName(\"test\") .build()) ; // fire and forget DB_POOL.submit(() -> { segment.end() ; insertData(id); }); } Copy The agent API calls in this sample are: startSegment(...): Begins the segment that will time the code. For method syntax, see the Javadoc. reportAsExternal(DatastoreParameters()): Associates the time with a datastore external call This will show up in APM with datastore data. For more information, see reportAsExternal API. For method syntax, see the Javadoc. segment.end(): Stops timing this segment. For method syntax, see the Javadoc. Add syntax highlighting To add syntax highlighting to a code block, add class=\"highlight\" to the <pre> tag. The syntax highlighter tries to auto-detect the language. If it's not working as expected, ensure the language is supported and specify the language by adding the a lang-LANG-NAME class (for example: lang-html). View a full list of supported languages for syntax highlighting. Element colors and themes are fully customizable. Link to other docs You can add <a href> tags inside a <pre> blocks, just as you would any other content. However, make sure to use them judiciously since they can be easy to miss. A good example is the Infrastructure config file template, where each config element links to the relevant section of the main config doc.",

      "body": "Helm is a package manager on top of Kubernetes. It facilitates installation, upgrades, or revision tracking, and it manages dependencies for the services that you install in Kubernetes. To install the integration using Helm, we recommend our Kubernetes automated installer, which will prompt for almost all configuration options and autopopulate secrets and values for you. Additionally, our automated installer also allows to install our integration as plain manifests rather than a Helm release. See Kubernetes integration: install and configure for more details about how to use our automated installer. Start the installer This page describes in more depth how to install and configure the New Relic integration without using the automated installer. Compatibility and requirements Make sure Helm is installed on your machine. We strongly recommend using Helm 3 to manage the Kubernetes integration. Our charts are also compatible with Helm 2, but support for it might be removed in the future. To install the Kubernetes integration using Helm, you will need your New Relic account license key and your Kubernetes cluster's name: Find and copy your New Relic license key. Find the name of your cluster with this command: kubectl config current-context Copy Note this values somewhere safe as you will need them later during the installation process. Install Kubernetes integration with Helm Install with Helm 3 and nri-bundle (recommended) New Relic has several charts for the different components which offer different features for the platform: newrelic-infrastructure: Contains the main Kubernetes integration and the infrastructure agent. This is the core component for the New Relic Kubernetes experience, responsible of reporting most of the data that is surfaced in dashboard and the Kubernetes Cluster Explorer. newrelic-logging: Provides a DaemonSet with New Relic's Fluent Bit output plugin to easily forward your logs to New Relic. nri-kube-events: Collects and reports cluster events (such as kubectl get events) to New Relic. nri-prometheus: New Relic's Prometheus OpenMetrics Integration, automatically scrapes Prometheus endpoints present in the cluser and reports metrics to New Relic. nri-metadata-injection: Sets up a minimal MutatingAdmissionWebhook that injects a couple of environment to containers. These contain metadata about the cluster and New Relic installation and will be later picked up by applications instrumented using APM, allowing to correlate APM and infrastructure data. nri-statsd: New Relic StatsD integration. Additionally, New Relic provides nri-bundle, a chart which pulls a selectable set of the charts mentioned above. nri-bundle can also install Kube State Metrics and Pixie for you if needed. While it is possible to install those charts separately, we strongly recommend using the nri-bundle chart for Kubernetes deployments, as it ensures that values across all the charts are consistent and provides full control over which components are installed, as well as the possibility to configure all of them as Helm dependencies. This is the same chart that is used and referenced by our automated installer. Installing and configuring nri-bundle with Helm Ensure you are using the appropriate context in the machine where you will run Helm and kubectl: You can check the available contexts with: kubectl config get-contexts Copy And switch to the desired context using: kubectl config use-context CONTEXT_NAME Copy Add the New Relic Helm charts repo: helm repo add newrelic https://helm-charts.newrelic.com Copy Make sure everything is configured properly in the chart by running the following command. Notice that we are specifying --dry-run and --debug, so nothing will be installed in this step: helm upgrade --install newrelic newrelic/nri-bundle \\ --dry-run \\ --debug \\ --namespace newrelic --create-namespace \\ --set global.licenseKey=YOUR_NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY \\ --set global.cluster=K8S_CLUSTER_NAME \\ --set ksm.enabled= true \\ --set newrelic-infrastructure.privileged= true \\ --set infrastructure.enabled=true \\ --set prometheus.enabled=true \\ --set webhook.enabled=true \\ --set kubeEvents.enabled=true \\ --set logging.enabled=true Copy Please notice and adjust the following flags: global.licenseKey=<var>YOUR_NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY</var>: Must be set to a valid License Key for your account. global.cluster=<var>K8S_CLUSTER_NAME</var>: Is used to identify the cluster in the New Relic UI, so should be a descriptive value not used by any other Kubernetes cluster configured in your New Relic account. ksm.enabled=<mark>true</mark>: Setting this to true will automatically install Kube State Metrics (KSM) for you, which is required for our integration to run. You can set this to false if KSM is already present in your cluster, even if it is on a different namespace. newrelic-infrastructure.privileged=<mark>true</mark>: Can be set to false to install a trimmed down version of our integration that does not require extra privileges, such as hostPath mounts or running containers as root. Please note that this will disable detailed process collection from the host. For performance reasons, our logging solution still requires hostPath mounts, regardless of the value of this flag. If this is not allowedin your cluster, you will need to disable the logging solution by specifying logging.enabled=false. prometheus.enabled=true: Will deploy our Prometheus OpenMetrics integration, which automatically collects data from prometheus endpoints present in the cluster. webhook.enabled=true: Will install our minimal webhook, which adds environment variables that, in turn, allows linking applications instrumented with APM with infrastructure data. Our chart has a comprehensive set of flags and tunables that can be edited to configure our solution to your particular needs. For a full list of all the flags that can be configured, please check the chart's README and the default values.yaml file. Install the Kubernetes integration by running the customized command without --debug and --dry-run: helm upgrade --install newrelic newrelic/nri-bundle \\ --namespace newrelic --create-namespace \\ --set global.licenseKey=YOUR_NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY \\ --set global.cluster=K8S_CLUSTER_NAME \\ --set ksm.enabled= true \\ --set newrelic-infrastructure.privileged= true \\ --set infrastructure.enabled=true \\ --set prometheus.enabled=true \\ --set webhook.enabled=true \\ --set kubeEvents.enabled=true \\ --set logging.enabled=true Copy Wait a few seconds, then check that the DaemonSet and pods have been created: kubectl -n newrelic get daemonsets,pods Copy Make sure you see a DaemonSet, and one pod per node for newrelic-infrastructure, as well as one Deployment and one pod for any other component that you have enabled. Install with Helm 2 and nri-bundle (legacy) Installation instructions for Helm 2 Important Helm 2 has been deprecated and New Relic does not recommend using it for deployments. Instructions in this section are provided for legacy systems only. To install using Helm 2: Ensure that Helm 2, including their cluster-side components (i.e. Tiller) are properly installed and configured. Please check the official documentation for more details. Set the cluster where you want to install the agent: kubectl config set-cluster DESIRED_CLUSTER Copy To see the available clusters, run kubectl config get-clusters Make sure that kube-state-metrics is installed on your machine: kubectl get deployment --all-namespaces | grep kube-state-metrics Copy If it's not installed, follow the instructions in the kube-state-metrics GitHub repo to install it. Add the New Relic Helm charts repo: helm repo add newrelic https://helm-charts.newrelic.com Copy Make sure everything is configured properly in the chart by running the following command. This step uses the --dry-run and --debug switches and therefore the agent is not installed. helm install newrelic/newrelic-infrastructure \\ --dry-run \\ --debug \\ --set licenseKey=YOUR_NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY \\ --set cluster=K8S_CLUSTER_NAME \\ --set config.custom_attributes.cluster=K8S_CLUSTER_NAME Copy Install the New Relic Kubernetes integration: helm install newrelic/newrelic-infrastructure \\ --set licenseKey=your_new_relic_license_key \\ --set cluster=K8S_CLUSTER_NAME \\ --set config.custom_attributes.cluster=K8S_CLUSTER_NAME Copy Tip Note that the --dry-run and --debug switches have been removed. Wait a few seconds, then check that the DaemonSet and pods have been created: kubectl get daemonsets,pods Copy Make sure you see a DaemonSet, and one pod per node. Helm configuration options When you install or upgrade the Kubernetes integration with Helm using the command line, you can pass your configuration variables with the --set flag. helm install newrelic/newrelic-infrastructure \\ --set licenseKey=YOUR_NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY \\ --set cluster=YOUR_CLUSTER_NAME Copy A full list of the configuration parameters can be found in the newrelic-infrastructure chart README Upgrade using Helm To update your Kubernetes integration installed via Helm: Update the local chart repository: helm repo update Copy Update the release by running again the appropriate helm upgrade --install ... command in the section above. Monitor services running on Kubernetes After having installed our Kubernetes integration, you can start instrumenting the services than run in your cluster. To learn more about how to do this, please check our Monitor services running on Kubernetes page. Use your Kubernetes data To learn more about how to use your Kubernetes data, please head to our detailed Find and use your Kubernetes data pages.",

      "body": "We've written these guidelines to make it easier for you to contribute to our docs, as well as to give you some insight into how we think about good technical writing. We, the Tech Docs team, rely on your expertise to keep New Relic's documentation updated and useful. Thank you for your willingness to share your knowledge! Our style guide focuses on style and usage that's particular to our site. Our site follows American English conventions. For topics that aren't covered, please refer to the Microsoft Writing Style Guide (for guidelines on technical terminology) or the Chicago Manual of Style (for general writing and editing guidelines). Organize your doc to make it easier to read Consider these organization guidelines when thinking about the order of information in a doc. By following these guidelines, you'll make it easier for readers to skim and find what they need. How to organize information Comments Separate what and why from how. Define any necessary prerequisites, policies, or background information (the what and the why) before you step through the how (step-by-step procedures). Examples: Explain what the feature is and why it matters before telling readers how to use it. Describe any limitations with user permissions or subscription levels that would prevent them from using the feature. If the feature is available for any user or subscription level, don't bother to say so. Provide a roadmap for what users will be able to accomplish, so they know before starting a procedure that they have everything they need. Front-load directions with context. Make sure readers know where they need to be, before telling them what to do. In general, use (select an app) to describe what users select from the product index. Examples: Go to one.newrelic.com > Explorer > (select an app or service). Select (account dropdown) > User preferences. On the command line, type gitk. Also, structure steps by front-loading context from the user's point of view. For example, instead of \"Go to x to do y,\" structure the step as \"To do y, go to x.\" Separate requirements from options. Example: Type the Email you use to sign in and to receive information from New Relic. Optional: Type additional user emails, separated by commas. Follow the \"five to nine\" guideline. Depending on the topic, organize the information so there is a maximum of five to nine chunks of information. For example, readers may start to get lost or overwhelmed after about five h2 sections or seven steps into a procedure. If you have more than nine h2 sections or steps, you might need to create an additional doc or procedure. Other organization tools to consider: Levels of headings Lists Collapsers Callouts Tables Code examples For more help section Use action-oriented titles Wherever possible, give your document or h2 heading a task- or action-oriented title. Focus on what users are trying to accomplish or the problem they're trying to solve. Use present-tense verbs, rather than \"-ing\" verbs. Quality Title example Bad The query history Okay View query history Good Query history: Create and edit NRQL queries Start the document with an introductory paragraph Unless the document is less than a single screen in length, begin with a brief paragraph that introduces the topic or summarizes the important points. Not sure where to start? Try writing all the content for your document first, and then add the introduction to the top to summarize your key points. Or use the introduction to expand on the text in your metaDescription in the metadata. Keep documents short The amount of content needed can help you decide whether you need one or more documents for the topic. If all of the document's contents apply directly to the title, then everything belongs in the same document. If several related sections could be logically split into individual documents, and the overall length of your document is more than about two screenfuls, split those sections into other documents. Be sure to include links to the related contents. If a large document needs to be broken into multiple smaller documents, consider whether they might be best grouped together in their own sub-category. Use the New Relic voice We strive for a voice that's approachable, expert, and visionary. Check out our voice guidelines for how to write content with these qualities. And keep in mind these essential writing tips that apply to any type of documentation. Guidelines Comments Be clear and direct. Remember to: Use present tense. Use active voice; avoid passive voice. Tell users what to do, not what they \"should\" do. If absolutely necessary, tell users what not to do in situations where unexpected results may occur. Whenever possible, provide an alternative suggestion when telling users what not to do. Example: Using active voice with an alternative suggestion for what not to do Do not use your config file to change this setting, because this could affect other processes. Instead, go to one.newrelic.com > APM > (select an app or service) > Settings > Application. Write to aid localization and translation. Do not use euphemisms, idioms, jargon, or slang. Use the same terms and wording consistently. If you need to include an abbreviation or acronym, spell it out the first time it appears in the document. Always take a moment to ask yourself whether people will really understand the terms you are using in the way you're using them. Change doc titles and anchors Because changes to doc titles, anchors, and redirects can break links to other docs, please create an issue to request these types of changes and we'll help you out with that. Create and edit categories Because changes to categories can affect large groups of docs at once, please create an issue to request these types of changes and we'll help you out with that.

      "body": "Access any of your New Relic One dashboards to create or manage your charts directly from the chart menu, customize your dashboard's layout, adjust display modes, or export your data. Once you have customized your dashboard and built your charts, use our advanced visualization features and tools for data exploration to correlate and analyze your data. Customize your dashboard Dashboards are highly flexible: you can tailor your dashboard layout and arrange chart sizes to optimize how you see your data. Tip Click the icon to access the See metadata and manage tags modal. There you can see the dashboard's GUID, account ID, and App ID, and manage all the tags that have been added to the dashboard. Dashboards features include: Edit your dashboard Use the edit button to: Copy the dashboard's permalink. Rename your dashboard. Names are searchable, so we recommend giving it a meaningful name. Create new content by clicking the Add widget button. Add a new chart using the query builder, or add text, images, or links using our markdown editor. Resize and rearrange charts. You can move any chart and put it anywhere in the dashboard so the layout you set fits your preferences: place your more relevant charts on top, or drop less used charts in a corner. You can set up to 12 columns of charts. Settings menu Use the settings menu on the upper right corner: To change the name of the dashboard. Names are searchable, so we recommend giving it a meaningful name that will help you locate your dashboard easily. To modify the dashboard's permissions. At the settings menu you can also see when the dashboard was created and the account it belongs to. These values cannot be modified. TV mode You can enable a full-screen TV mode that optimizes the dashboard for display on a television screen. There are two ways to turn on TV mode: When viewing a dashboard in New Relic One, select the icon at the top right. Add this parameter to a dashboard page URL: &platform[tvMode]=true To configure TV mode, from a dashboard, select the icon. Options include: Dashboard name display. Turning off the dashboard name gives the dashboard charts more space on the screen. Page cycle. For dashboards with multiple pages, this automatically cycles from page to page. Dark mode High-contrast mode is available in dashboards. Select the icon from the upper right menu bar. Copy your dashboard as JSON You can copy your dashboard as JSON and add it to the clipboard by clicking on the < / > icon on the right corner. Export your dashboard You can export your dashboard as a pdf file clicking the icon. Duplicate your dashboard You can duplicate your dashboard clicking the duplicate icon regardless of your permission levels. The dashboard is automatically copied and the duplicate is added to the index. The duplicate has Public - Read and write permissions. Access the new, duplicated dashboard by clicking on the message that pops up on your screen. The duplicated dashboard is named like the original dashboard followed by the word “copy”. For example, if you duplicate a dashboard named This is my dashboard, the duplicate is called This is my dashboard copy. You can change the name when you duplicate it. You can edit the name and other properties of the dashboard, such as permissions, any time. Tip You can use the search feature at any time to search data across New Relic One. Add new content to your dashboard There are multiple ways to add new content to your dashboard: From the data explorer and query builder features. Use the + Add to your dashboard button (accessible from the main dashboard page or in the edit mode) to access the query builder, or to add content (such as text, links, or images) using our Markdown editor. Copy an existing chart from any dashboard. If you experience issues adding new content, check our error messages. Add custom content using the markdown editor The Markdown editor contains a Markdown pane, where you enter your content, as well as a Preview pane, where you can view it. For more information about Markdown syntax options, see the Commonmark website. You can also edit existing content by clicking the ellipses icon on any markdown widget and selecting Edit. Organize your dashboards with pages You can use multiple pages to organize your dashboard data in different views. When you add more pages to that dashboard, you can access these pages using the tabs at the top of the dashboard UI. one.newrelic.com > Dashboards: This is an example of a dashboard in New Relic One with multiple pages, represented by the tabs at the top of the dashboard. You can add pages to dashboards, copy existing pages, and drag and drop the page tabs to new positions. You can use this feature to group together related dashboard views. This is valuable when you're aggregating a lot of data and charts related to a specific project, team, or subject. For example, a mobile app team might build a dashboard focused on app performance by country. The first dashboard page might be an overview of performance across all countries, with other pages focused on specific countries. We offer other features to connect dashboards: Create widgets containing markdown text to add direct links to specific UI pages or dashboards. Use facet filtering to create links that automatically link to and filter other dashboards. Use the dashboard search to find similarly named dashboards. To take advantage of this, you can add team- or project-specific words/phrases to dashboard names. In New Relic Insights, this feature was called data apps. For more about switching from Insights to New Relic One, see our transition guide. Add and edit pages to a dashboard To add or edit a page in a dashboard: From a new or existing dashboard, enter edit mode by selecting the icon. Add a new page: Select Add a page to add a blank page. Clone an existing page by clicking the dropdown next to a dashboard name, and selecting Duplicate. While in edit mode, you can add widgets to the new page, drag and drop page tabs to new locations, and do other dashboard editing tasks. When finished, select Done editing. Manage your charts and markdown content From any markdown element, access the menu on the upper right corner to edit or delete it. From any chart, access the chart action menu on the upper right corner to: Expand your chart to full screen. Share your chart as an image or with a link. Copy the chart to any dashboard. For table charts only, export as a .csv file. You can import this file into other apps like Microsoft Excel or Google Sheets to do further analysis. Create an alert condition. Open the NRQL console to see or edit the query associated to the chart. Duplicate the chart. Delete the chart. Important You cannot edit the query of a chart if you have Read only permissions to the dashboard. Learn more about how to use your charts. Filter and refine your charts You can narrow down the information on display using the filtering function, which is a visual representation of query conditions: Use the filter bar to select the values or attributes you want to see, and remove the rest of the elements from the charts. Open the advanced filter bar to access the boolean operators (such as =, !=, CONTAINS, EXCLUDES, etc.) and add compound and complex conditions for filtering data. After applying the filter, your dashboard will only show the data associated to the elements you selected. A small counter indicates how many filters are being applied at a time. To return to the default view, click on the small cross by the filter to remove it. Filter using the chart legend Click on a legend in any chart with legends to see that series only and remove the rest of them from the chart. This helps you isolate the data you want to analyze. Use CMD (in a Mac) or CTRL (in Windows) for the opposite behavior: removing the selected series and keeping the rest. Filter dashboards using facets If a chart's NRQL query contains a FACET clause, you can use the faceted attributes to filter the current dashboard or another related dashboard. For details, see Filter by facets. Use the time picker to adjust time settings By default, each chart in the dashboard will show data for the time period specified when they were created in the query builder. However, you can use the time picker to change the time range of the data on display and set the same range for all charts. This is particularly useful while troubleshooting incidents, if you need to narrow down your data to observe what happened in a specific time period. The refresh rate depends on the duration of the time window you are viewing. For more information and examples, see Chart refresh intervals. To change the time range: Select one of the available options from the dropdown menu (ranging from Last 30 minutes to Last 7 days). Customize the time range with specific start and end timestamps using the custom menu. Important In dashboards, unlike Insights, the time zone is independent from your laptop's time. You can set the time zone you want to use in your user preferences, easily accessible from the custom menu in the time picker. Export and share your data It is very easy to export dashboard and chart data and share it within your company and beyond: You can export any dashboard as a PDF file, using the Export dashboard as PDF button located in the upper right menu bar. You can also share your charts either as a PNG image or as a link. Go to the chart menu and select either the Get as image or Get chart link options.",

      "body": "When you're creating a new doc, there's a lot to keep track of. You can use this checklist to make sure you've done everything. Title Check that: The doc's title effectively describes the contents. Procedural doc titles use active verbs; for example, Install not Installing. Introduction Check that: The introduction leads with an outcome and provides an overview of how to get there, so customers are confident they've found the right doc. It provides a short, readable overview of the doc's contents. Headings (H2s) Check that: Heading names are concise, yet provide information that helps readers to skim or skip to the section they want. Procedural H2s use active verbs, not the ing verb form. Text Check that the text: Optimizes for easier translation: Avoid idioms, slang, specific cultural references, etc. Tells a good story: Promotes the platform (other New Relic products, alerting, etc.). Includes examples and use cases, identifies personas, explains not only what it is or how to use it but why it matters. Includes hyperlinks in UI paths. Has no typos. Procedures Procedures use active voice and focus on steps (\"do this\"). Avoid burying tips or extra details in the steps. If the procedure includes prerequisites or background information, that information appears before (not buried inside) the ordered list of procedures. If a procedure or step branches, it splits the options so they are clearly visible as bullets, collapsers, etc. If the procedure says what not to do, it also describes what to do instead. Example: What not to do and what to do instead Do not monitor your own applications from the partnership owner account. Instead, create an account within the partnership, and monitor apps from that account. Structure The original tech writer or docs site contributor is the best judge of whether the draft doc is complete. However, in your peer edit, make notes if you have unanswered questions that aren't addressed within the doc or its cross references. Doc structure Comments Complete Check that the overall doc: Is complete, but stays on topic. Includes useful cross references, hyperlinks, and other suggestions to enhance the information, especially for SEO. Skimmable Readers can see at a glance what the doc is about and what to do. It's obvious what parts they can read and what parts they can skip. Visually clean The doc avoids excessive use of callouts, long sentences, or long paragraphs. Useful images For screenshots and images, check that: Full size images always have captions to explain their relevance. UI paths in captions always have hyperlinks. Cropped images clearly show their relevance, with or without captions. In addition, make sure that screenshots and images follow the docs site's security guidelines, and that no private information related to customers or New Relic is displayed. Levels of detail The doc uses H2s, H3s, bullets, tables, and clamshells to organize complex levels of information.",

      "body": "Sliding windows are a technique for generating charts using the SLIDE BY clause in conjunction with the TIMESERIES clause. With sliding windows, data is gathered in time \"windows\" that overlap with each other. For example, in the image below, a query gathers data with 5 minute windows. The windows \"slide\" by 1 minute. Each window overlaps with the previous window by 4 minutes. 5-minute windows with 1-minute \"slide\" In contrast, with \"tumbling\" or \"cascading\" windows, the windows do not overlap. For example, in this TIMESERIES 3 minutes NRQL query, the windows are 3 minutes in length, with each beginning when the other ends. There is no overlap in the measurement interval. 3-minute windows with no overlap or \"slide\". When to use sliding windows Sliding windows are helpful when you need to smooth out \"spiky\" charts. One common use case is to use sliding windows to smooth line graphs that have a lot of variation over short periods of time in cases where the rolling aggregate (for example a rolling mean) is more important than aggregates from narrow windows of time. In the example below, data varies greatly from one minute to another, so the 1-minute tumbling window chart shows many high peaks and low valleys. TIMESERIES query without SLIDE BY clause However, in this example, 5-minute wide TIMESERIES windows are smoothed with the help of 1-minute SLIDE BY intervals. The query returns similar data but creates a much smoother chart. TIMESERIES query with SLIDE BY clause Valid NRQL syntax for SLIDE BY Valid NRQL syntax for the SLIDE BY clause will follow the format below. SELECT ... TIMESERIES integer1 units SLIDE BY integer2 units Copy integer1 specifies the sliding window width and integer2 specifies the SLIDE BY interval. units is a time unit, such as second, minute, hour, or day. All standard NRQL time units are accepted. Here’s a real-life example. It shows 5-minute TIMESERIES windows with a 1-minute SLIDE BY interval. SELECT average(duration) from Transaction TIMESERIES 5 minutes SLIDE BY 1 minute Copy Translation from PromQL-style queries When applicable, a PromQL-style query is translated into a NRQL sliding window query. For example, if your PromQL style query uses rate(request_count[5m]) for the past 60 minutes with a 1-minute window overlap, the NRQL translation would be the query below. SELECT rate(sum(request_count), 1 SECONDS) FROM Metric SINCE 3600 SECONDS AGO UNTIL NOW FACET dimensions() LIMIT 100 TIMESERIES 300000 SLIDE BY 60000 Copy In the translation output, the default unit of millisecond is used for TIMESERIES and SLIDE BY clauses. For TIMESERIES, 300000 ms is 300 seconds, or 5 minutes, specifying a window size of 5 minutes. For SLIDE BY, 60000 ms is 60 seconds, specifying a slide interval of 1 minute. Use SLIDE BY with MAX and AUTO You can combine SLIDE BY with MAX and AUTO arguments to further tailor query results, as shown in the examples below. SELECT average(duration) FROM Transaction TIMESERIES 5 minutes SLIDE BY MAX Copy SELECT average(duration) FROM Transaction TIMESERIES 5 minutes SLIDE BY AUTO Copy Tip When paired with SLIDE BY, TIMESERIES does not support AUTO or MAX. The TIMESERIES value must be an integer time unit value. In other words, SLIDE BY AUTO or SLIDE BY MAX will work, but TIMESERIES AUTO or TIMESERIES MAX followed by SLIDE BY and MAX, AUTO, or a specific integer time unit is not supported. Tip The SLIDE BY value as determined by AUTO or MAX can produce a step interval greater than the window size, which will show up as gaps and unexpected results. If you experience these issues with query results, consider checking for instances of SLIDE BY where the step interval exceeds the window size.",

Filter and group hosts Use filter sets to show only hosts matching certain criteria, or use group by to aggregate the results. Understand host health Use the Health column of the table. To see more details about specific violations, select the health status icons. Find root causes of issues Use the Events heatmap at the top of the page to compare performance to important events happening in your infrastructure. For more, see Events heatmap. Set an alert condition for a metric Mouse over a chart, select and then Create alert. View host's alert threshold violation If present, select the host's Critical icon or Warning icon. APM and infrastructure data If you have APM data associated with your infrastructure data, there are several ways to access your APM data on the Hosts page: Use the hosts filter to filter on hosts running specific applications. In the host list below the charts, select the Application column to filter on specific applications. From the chart selector dropdown beside a chart's name, select one of the application-related charts. Important APM charts in infrastructure monitoring do not have View query or Create alert options like the other infrastructure charts do. For more about using APM and infrastructure monitoring together, see APM data in infrastructure. Network tab The Network page provides real-time visibility into the health and performance of individual hosts, web servers, or other groups of resources across your network. Default charts show bandwidth metrics by packet, bandwidth by bytes, and errors per second. Details about individual interfaces can help you: Examine saturation levels across your network or for selected filter sets. Compare load balances between specific resources. Identify unexpected differences in capacity patterns between similar hosts. Evaluate the top five network errors that New Relic automatically presents for the selected time period. This real-time network data can then help you determine whether to resolve errors by reconfiguring your network, rebalancing the loads, or taking other preventative maintenance actions before needing to make a purchase decision. From the Network tab you can view bandwidth and error data about your network interfaces. The Network page includes an Events heatmap, which provides a snapshot of the events occurring within the same time range as the displayed metrics. For a technical explanation of the attributes used to populate the Network page chart, see NetworkSample attributes. Network tab functions Here are some of the things you can do from the Network tab: If you want to... Do this... Filter and group Use filter sets to show only hosts matching certain criteria, or use Group by to aggregate the results. Select a time range Use the time picker to change the range of time selected. You can also click and drag on the chart to select a custom time range. When you select a time range, it carries over when you go from one infrastructure page to another. Change metrics displayed in chart Use the sorting dropdown to switch what metric the chart is displaying for the chosen process groupings, including: Received Bytes Received Dropped Received Errors Received Packets Transmitted Bytes Transmitted Dropped Transmitted Errors Transmitted Packets Search and filter the list Type in the Search interfaces search bar to filter the list to only those items containing the text you've typed. You can also filter the list by simply selecting the list item or user name you want to filter for. The chosen filters are displayed beside the filter icon above the chart. Add items to chart The chart, by default, displays the top five results. Use the Chart shows dropdown to display more results. To remove an item from a chart, select its name below the chart. Set an alert condition for a metric Mouse over a chart, select and then Create alert. (Not available on APM charts.) View host's alert threshold violation Select the host's Critical icon or Warning icon. Processes tab Important By default, the infrastructure agent doesn't send data about the operating system's processes unless you use guided install. To enable the sending of process data set enable_process_metrics to true. To fine-tune which processes you want to monitor, configure include_matching_metrics. Use the Processes tab to get information about processes running on your hosts, and to set alerts on process metrics. The Processes tab shows data such as CPU percentage, I/O bytes, and memory usage for individual processes or groupings of processes. The page also includes an events heatmap, which provides a snapshot of the events occurring within the same time range as the displayed metrics. Use this information to: Pinpoint processes that are causing performance issues. Create alerts for conditions such as CPU percentage and memory usage. On the Processes page, CPU percent is scoped to individual processes, rather than hosts. Because of this, the CPU percent metric does not take into account the resources of the entire system. Instead, it shows how much of a single CPU core each process is taking. Example Here's an example of how to pinpoint an issue and set an alert: You notice on the Hosts page that a cluster has a CPU percentage much higher than normal. You go to the Processes page and filter down to that cluster's processes. You notice that several instances of the same process have excessive CPU percentage. After fixing the issue, you decide to create an alert condition that triggers when the CPU percentage for that process type exceeds a certain threshold. For a technical explanation of the attributes used to populate the Processes page chart, see ProcessSample attributes. Tip You cannot start, stop, or restart processes from the UI. Instead, follow standard procedures to start, stop, check, or restart the infrastructure agent manually. Processes tab functions Here are some of the things you can do from the Processes tab: If you want to... Do this... Only show hosts matching certain criteria Use filter sets. Aggregate results or group by host attributes Use Group by to change how the processes are grouped in the chart and the list. The dropdown contains host-related attributes such as hostID and entityName. If you are monitoring AWS EC2 instances, EC2-related attributes such as awsRegion will be available. Select a time range Use either of these options: Select any of the time picker options at the top of the page. Click and drag on the chart to select a custom time range. After you select a time range, it carries over from one infrastructure page to another. View Docker metrics To view process usage by Docker containers, see Docker instrumentation. Change charts Select the dropdown beside the chart's name to switch what metric the chart displays. Choices include: Memory: Resident or virtual size CPU percentage Disk I/O: Read or write Search and filter the list Use either of these options: Type in the Search processes search bar. Select the list item or user name you want to filter for. The selected filters appear beside the filter icon above the chart, where you can select and remove them as needed. Set an alert condition for a metric Mouse over a chart. Select and then Create alert. (Not available on APM charts.) View host's alert threshold violation Select the host's Critical icon or Warning icon. Storage tab The Storage page allows you to monitor your resources' capacity and efficiency, including your devices' overall utilization, disk usage, or I/O operations. This can help you to: Examine unexpected patterns; for example, a cluster of mirrored machines that do not process I/O tasks uniformly. Monitor usage levels before disk space completely runs out. Set alert conditions to notify you about problems with one or more hosts; for example, long processing times for read or write operations, disk availability or utilization based on percentage or bytes, etc. Make informed decisions about where to redistribute hosts with higher or lower than normal processing requests. Use data to help plan for additions or changes to your infrastructure budget before an emergency arises. The Storage page includes an Events heatmap, which provides a snapshot of the events occurring within the same time range as the displayed metrics. For a technical explanation of the attributes used to populate the Storage page chart, see StorageSample attributes. Storage tab functions Here are some of the things you can do from the Storage tab: If you want to... Do this... Filter and group Use filter sets to show only hosts matching certain criteria, or use Group by to aggregate the results. Select a time range Use the time picker on the upper right to change the range of time selected. You can also click and drag on the chart to select a custom time range. When you select a time range, it carries over when you go from one infrastructure page to another. Change metrics displayed in chart Use the sorting dropdown to switch what metric the chart is displaying for the chosen process groupings. Choices include: Total Utilization % Read Utilization % Write Utilization % Disk Used Bytes Disk Free Bytes I/O Read Operations I/O Write Operations Search and filter the list Type in the Search devices search bar to filter the list. You can also filter the list by simply selecting the list item or user name you want to filter for. The chosen filters are displayed beside the filter icon above the chart. Add/remove chart items The chart, by default, displays the top five results. Use the Chart shows dropdown to display more results. To remove an item, select its name below the chart. Set an alert condition for a metric Mouse over a chart. Select and then Create alert. (Not available on APM charts.) View host's alert threshold violation Select the host's Critical icon or Warning icon. Docker containers tab Use the Docker containers tab to get information about the containers running on your hosts, and to set alerts on container metrics. The Docker containers tab shows data such as CPU percentage, I/O bytes, and memory usage for individual containers or groupings of containers. The page also includes an events heatmap, which provides a snapshot of the events occurring within the same time range as the displayed metrics. Use this information to: Identify containers that are experiencing performance issues. Create alerts for conditions such as CPU percentage and memory usage. Docker containers tab functions Here are some of the things you can do from the Docker containers tab: If you want to... Do this... Only show hosts matching certain criteria Use filter sets. Aggregate results or group by host attributes Use Group by to change how the processes are grouped in the chart and the list. The dropdown contains host-related attributes such as image and operatingSystem. Select a time range Use either of these options: Select any of the time picker options at the top of the page. Click and drag on the chart to select a custom time range. After you select a time range, it carries over from one infrastructure page to another. View Docker integration dashboard To open the Docker integration dashboard, click the Dashboard link above the data table. Change charts Select the dropdown beside the chart's name to switch what metric the chart displays. Choices include: CPU: Used cores, kernel percentage Memory: Size limit, cache bytes I/O: Write count per second, total bytes Network: Errors per second, packets Process: Process count, restart count Search and filter the list Use either of these options: Type in the Search processes search bar. Select the list item or user name you want to filter for. The selected filters appear beside the filter icon above the chart, where you can select and remove them as needed.

      "body": "This document serves as a supplement to the basic <var> and <mark> documentation. It gives a longer explanation of when to use the <var> and <mark> formatting styles, and reasons for not using them. var: Highlight user-specific values in procedural code snippets The <var> tag is used for user-input values in code snippets that customers would be using in procedural/functional ways. For example, you would use the <var> tag when explaining how to do some specific task. A <var> tag would not be used for: Example code: If the code is meant to be an example, to show the format/structure of the code, and there is not an actual procedure the customer is following, var tags are not needed. Examples: Example configuration file (or this Java agent config template): if you are showing an example config file that isn't part of a procedure, you shouldn't use the <var> tag. Several reasons for this: 1) The important part of showing an example config file is to show the overall structure of the file, 2) Usually the number of config options present in a file will vary based on whatever the customer wishes to use, so using <var> tags can actually be confusing as it implies that these values must be present. Instrumentation procedure (at bottom of the Java section): the var tag wouldn't be necessary because it's an example, not part of a procedure, and the main goal is seeing the general structure. Also, because it's an example of app code, the concept of user-specific values doesn't have much meaning, because the entire code will vary dependent on how the customer has written their code. (If anything, this would be a potential for using <mark> format to emphasize the New Relic functions.) Response/output code: If the code is meant to show an expected return, and is not related to a procedure, then var tags shouldn't be used. Here's a doc section (the returned JSON) where var tags are not needed. For an example of a doc section with both <var> formatting and without it, see the Synthetics monitors REST API example. The first block shows a command they might choose to run, hence it uses a <var> tag. The second block is just an example output, showing the structure that would be returned; it doesn't require a <var> tag. For some use cases, highlighting may be a better choice than a var tag. var format examples Below are some general style recommendations for formatting user-specific <var> values. <var> tag formatting may vary based on language- or system-specific expectations, so be sure check the style used in the documentation section in question, and to ask relevant SMEs what they think of the style. Account IDs and other IDs/#s: YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID, YOUR_API_CODE, etc. This should be the general style used. URLs: example.com, or maybe YOUR_URL Paths: PATH/TO/SOMETHING.exe or maybe PATH_TO_FILE Emails: datanerd@example.com or maybe YOUR_EMAIL Bash variables for REST API code: Some <var> tagged code values on the docs site have the form $ { API_KEY}. This is a format used for variables in bash scripts, where users assign values to specific variable names and then call those variables later in the script by using the $VARIABLE_NAME. For more info, see this explanation of bash variables. Important The bash variable style is currently used in the REST API docs and in some Synthetics docs and that's fine. But going forward we should use the general variable style (without the $ and &lt; >). mark: Emphasize non-procedure code snippets Highlighting (<mark>) is used for when you want to draw attention to a variable or value, but it's not something directly procedural related. Here are two examples of highlighting: Highlighting values in code response that are meant for later use: Activate Azure integrations doc. Highlighting the commands in a large code block example that are New Relic-specific commands, with explanations below: Java API doc.",

      "body": "This document will guide you through the entire workflow for editing the New Relic documentation site as a New Relic Tech Docs Writer. Resources VSCode (or another text editor) VSCode has great GitHub integrations GitHub account GitHub Desktop Edit in the UI vs local build Need to edit a doc? Use this table to decide where to work! Use the UI for: Use the local build for: Adding content to one doc: Rewriting sentences, or 1-2 lines Editing small amounts of content: updating URLs, deleting typos, etc. Brand new docs Rewrites of more than 1 or 2 lines Any updates to doc frontmatter Title changes Taxonomy changes Metadescription updates Redirects Updating images Editing multiple docs at once Continue reading for instructions on how to edit a doc locally. Work on a branch, not a fork Some teams work on branches, some teams work on forks; the docs team works in branches. As long as a branch has been pushed upstream, this allows us to work collaboratively and ensure that no work is ever lost when someone goes on vacation. To create a branch on the docs-website repo: Open GitHub Desktop Click on Current branch: xxx Click on New Branch You will be prompted to name your new branch. Descriptive names are best. It's a great way to quickly clue people in to what your work is all about. For example, if you are working on What’s New pages, you might name the branch Whats-new-updates. When you create a new branch, don't forget to add the Jira issue's key (DOC-1234) to the branch name and the PR title. Set up your local environment Running the site locally makes testing and previewing large changes much easier. Here's how to get setup: Install GitHub Desktop Sign in to GitHub Desktop. On Macs, click on GitHub Desktop in the top left corner of your screen and select Preferences. Select the blue Sign In button and follow the prompts in the browser window. Navigate to the Docs Site repository on GitHub.com. Click the green Code button and then select Open with GitHub Desktop. Choose the location where you want the repo, and this will clone the entire repository to your local machine at the designated path. You can ensure the repo was cloned by navigating to your local GitHub folder (the default is ~/Documents/github). Once you have cloned the repo, you don't need to clone it again in the future. Run the site locally Build the site locally using the terminal to preview changes before opening a Pull Request. While it's highly recommended to build the site locally, this is technically an optional step. The site will automatically reflect any local changes once build. Node and Yarn are tools used to build the site on your local machine. Prerequisites Install Node Install Yarn npm install -g yarn Build the site In your terminal, go to your cloned repo, docs-website. For example: cd ~/Documents/github/docs-website Run yarn with the following commands: yarn && yarn start The site will take a few minutes to build. Make yourself some tea or coffee. Once it's built, you can access your preview site in your browser by navigating to http://localhost:8000/ Edit a doc Once your local environment and branch are set up, you're ready to edit a doc. Check out the style guide for writing guidelines. First, ensure your Current Branch in GitHub Desktop is set to the correct branch, not Develop. Navigate to the doc you want to edit in Finder. If I wanted to edit a Python agent doc, I would navigate to: ~/Documents/github/docs-website/src/content/docs/agents/python-agent/hosting-services/python-agent-stackato.mdx Edit the doc in your text editor of choice. You should write docs in markdown language. Reference the style guide for help with formatting markdown Save the file with your edits, then follow the same process for any other docs you wish to edit. Commit your changes Once your edits are done, you can commit them. This stages your changes, which you will later push upstream to Github. By pushing your changes, everyone will have access to your branch and commits. Navigate to GitHub Desktop. The left column should have a record of all the edits you have made to docs. In the bottom left corner, name your commit and add a good description of your edits. It should be descriptive enough to ensure that someone can understand all the changes made by simply scanning this description. Click Commit to [yourbranchname] Publish your commits Once you have committed your changes, you're almost ready to open your Pull Request. First, you need to ensure your branch is pushed upstream. On GitHub desktop, click the blue Publish Branch button if available. If you don't see the Publish Branch, click the blue Push Origin button. This will push all your commits upstream and make them available to everyone else through the GitHub repository. Open your pull request Now that your commits are available to everyone, you need to notify people that your changes are ready to be merged into the develop branch. To do this, you open a pull request: On GitHub Desktop, click the blue Create Pull Request button. This will open GitHub in your browser, and prompt you to fill in your pull request. Ensure you're merging from your branch into either the main or develop branch. If you scroll down, you can review all your commits to ensure they reflect all your changes. Just like your commit description, your pull request description should be detailed and give the full context of your changes. Feel free to add any additional context here (issue or Jira number, SMEs, etc.) To request a review from another Tech Writer: in GitHub open the PR, navigate to the Conversation section, and then select or type in a reviewer name in the Reviewer section. Add any relevant labels to your PR. If you do not add from_tw, the PR will not be automatically assigned to another writer for review. Once you're satisfied with your pull request, click the green Create pull request button. You can either publish the changes directly by approving the pull request yourself, or you can request for another Tech Writer to peer edit it. At the bottom of the pull request page, you will see a Checks section. These checks ensure your PR doesn't break the build process of the site. Ensure all checks marked required pass before merging. Once the pull request has passed the checks and it has been approved by another tech writer (or you are confident the changes are ready to be published), click the green Merge pull request button. This will merge your branch and commits into the repository and will begin the build process. If you don't add the from_tw label when you first create a PR, it will not automatically assign a reviewer. If you forget to add the label before opening the PR: Add the from_tw label. Turn the PR into a draft PR. Select the PR is ready for review button at the bottom of the page to reopen the PR. The PR should now have a reviewer. Preview a doc There are two main ways to preview branches you’ve already published and run commits on: Local: Quicker, but requires a semi-substantial amount of setup and familiarity with a terminal. Gatsby Cloud: Full preview of the live site with no overhead, and a very convenient way to share a preview of your draft with a SME. Gatsby Cloud will comment on your PR with a link to a preview version of the site once the build is ready. Building the site generally takes about 15 minutes, but can sometimes take longer if there are a lot of changes. Revise and publish a doc If you’re notified that a reviewer has submitted a review to your file, go to your PR and review the changes. You might see them in the diff view, if they’re part of a review with comments; otherwise, they might appear as copy edits in the file. Respond to any comments in the file. Either reply with follow up discussion, or click Resolve conversation. When you’ve resolved all the comments, and all of the automatic checks have passed, you can merge the pull request. Merging the pull request sets in motion the automated build process and your changes will be published shortly. Note: You will only be able to merge when the Merge pull request button is green. If it’s not green, review for any comments you missed, or other messages that indicate why GitHub is blocking you from merging. Revert merging Remember that you can almost always undo things. If you merge a PR, and then find that you shouldn’t have, you can unmerge with the Revert button. On the Pull requests tab in GitHub, click Closed on the tally bar to see all the issues and PRs that have alredy been merged. Locate the PR you merged, and locate the Revert button. Click Revert. That creates a new PR, which needs to be merged. If you want to reopen it, you need to follow the link back to the original PR and either revert that or reopen it.",

For more context on when to use <mark> tags, see < mark> formatting guidelines. Examples: Example of using the <mark> tag private void storeItem(long id) { Segment segment = NewRelic.getAgent().getTransaction(). startSegment(\"storeItem\") ; segment. reportAsExternal(DatastoreParameters .product(\"H2\") .collection(null) .operation(\"insert\") .instance(\"localhost\", 8080) .databaseName(\"test\") .build()) ; // fire and forget DB_POOL.submit(() -> { segment.end() ; insertData(id); }); } Copy The agent API calls in this sample are: startSegment(...): Begins the segment that will time the code. For method syntax, see the Javadoc. reportAsExternal(DatastoreParameters()): Associates the time with a datastore external call This will show up in APM with datastore data. For more information, see reportAsExternal API. For method syntax, see the Javadoc. segment.end(): Stops timing this segment. For method syntax, see the Javadoc. Add syntax highlighting To add syntax highlighting to a code block, add class=\"highlight\" to the <pre> tag. The syntax highlighter tries to auto-detect the language. If it's not working as expected, ensure the language is supported and specify the language by adding the a lang-LANG-NAME class (for example: lang-html). View a full list of supported languages for syntax highlighting. Element colors and themes are fully customizable. Link to other docs You can add <a href> tags inside a <pre> blocks, just as you would any other content. However, make sure to use them judiciously since they can be easy to miss. A good example is the Infrastructure config file template, where each config element links to the relevant section of the main config doc.",

Then, clone this doc using the Clone content link in the Page tools box. Delete all content up to Introduction (this heading won't be visible). For the doc title (the field at top of page): Doc should be named in a practical, use-case-focused way. Example: Add custom attributes to transactions Introduction (this heading will not be visible) Provide a brief explanation of what this document will teach customers, and why it is valuable for customers to know how to do that. Focus on the value the API provides to the customers and mention specific, common use cases. Any relevant notes about support/compatability should go here, too. Here's an example from the Java API asynchronous tutorial doc: New Relic for Java includes an API to instrument asynchronous activity. For supported frameworks, the Java agent usually instruments async work automatically. However, the async API can be useful for adding more detail to your data. This document provides examples of using tokens and segments to instrument your app. Optional: Provide an overview for complex processes This is an optional section for complicated tutorials that involve either using several methods in one procedure or that have different alternate steps you can take to achieve similar results. This section can link to lower-down sections to allow users to skip around as needed. For simple tutorials, this section isn't necessary. For an example, see this section of the Java async tutorial. Provide a procedure to accomplish the task Tell the user how to accomplish the task, and link to the methods necessary to accomplish that task. As much as possible, we're looking to describe tasks in \"procedures\" (procedure is tech writer jargon for a series of numbered steps). This may be tough to do for fairly open-ended/variable tasks, but it will usually be possible to chunk the content at a fairly high-level to make it into a procedure. Along the way, explain what the importance of the procedure step is, and how one might verify that the step was done correctly. For code samples, avoid using large chunks of code. Instead, use smaller pieces of code and give context for how they are being used. (If you think a large app code example would be helpful, place that later in the doc in the Example section.) Tip For an example of an open-ended task segmented into procedural chunks, see the Asynchronous doc section Connecting async threads. For another example, see this TomCat GAE Flex procedure. Base your procedure on the simple structure below. Tech writers will edit your content to match our style and formatting requirements: Step 1. Do something... Methods and example code to implement the first step. For each step, if applicable, indicate the significance of that step (why it's important) and how the user might verify that the step was done correctly (for example, something showing up in UI, or running a verification test of some sort). If needed: Step 2. Do something else... Methods and example code to implement step 2. If needed: Step 3. Do something else... Methods and example code to implement step 3. Last step. Verify that the task was completed... Explain how a user would know they'd completed the task correctly. In particular, how would the user find the new change or data in the New Relic UI. What NR products and pages would the change be noticed on? If new data shows up in Insights, what event types can it be found under? Optional: Do something else with the API Same as above. Make as many headings and separate procedures as needed. Optional: Large example code block If you think a large app code example would be useful, place here. Within any code block, explain all New Relic functions/methods, not just the main methods. Instead of in-line comments, consider using highlighted sections underneath the code block to give additional context. Here's an example: Code block example The following code example shows a segment starting in the storeItem method to measure how long the Lambda statement is waiting in the thread pool. To stop timing the segment, you must call either .end() or .ignore(). If you don't want to report the segment as part of its parent transaction, call .ignore(). Otherwise, to report the segment as part of its parent transaction, call .end(). private void storeItem(long id) { Segment segment = NewRelic.getAgent().getTransaction(). startSegment(\"storeItem\") ; segment. reportAsExternal (DatastoreParameters .product(\"H2\") .collection(null) .operation(\"insert\") .instance(\"localhost\", 8080) .databaseName(\"test\") .build()); // fire and forget DB_POOL.submit(() -> { segment.end(); insertData(id); }); } Copy The agent API calls in this sample are: startSegment(...): Begins the segment that will time the code.

      "body": "You can surface Kubernetes metadata and link it to your APM agents as distributed traces to explore performance issues and troubleshoot transaction errors. For more information, see this New Relic blog post. You can quickly start monitoring Kubernetes clusters using Auto-telemetry with Pixie, which is currently a beta release. This Pixie integration into New Relic does not require a language agent. Learn more about Auto-telemetry with Pixie here. Tip Our Kubernetes metadata injection project is open source. Here's the code to link APM and infrastructure data and the code to automatically manage certificates. Compatibility and requirements Before linking Kubernetes metadata to your APM agents, make sure you meet the following requirements: Kubernetes requirements Network requirements APM agent compatibility OpenShift requirements Kubernetes requirements To link your applications and Kubernetes, your cluster must have the MutatingAdmissionWebhook controller enabled, which requires Kubernetes 1.9 or higher. To verify that your cluster is compatible, run the following command: kubectl api-versions | grep admissionregistration.k8s.io/v1beta1 admissionregistration.k8s.io/v1beta1 Copy If you see a different result, follow the Kubernetes documentation to enable admission control in your cluster. Network requirements For Kubernetes to speak to our MutatingAdmissionWebhook, the master node (or the API server container, depending on how the cluster is set up) should be allowed egress for HTTPS traffic on port 443 to pods in all of the other nodes in the cluster. This might require specific configuration depending on how the infrastructure is set up (on-premises, AWS, Google Cloud, etc). Tip Until Kubernetes v1.14, users were only allowed to register admission webhooks on port 443. Since v1.15 it's possible to register them on different ports. To ensure backward compatibility, the webhook is registered by default on port 443 in the YAML config file we distribute. APM agent compatibility The following New Relic agents collect Kubernetes metadata: Go 2.3.0 or higher Java 4.10.0 or higher Node.js 5.3.0 or higher Python 4.14.0 or higher Ruby 6.1.0 or higher .NET 8.17.438 or higher Openshift requirements To link Openshift and Kubernetes you must enable mutating admission webhooks, which requires Openshift 3.9 or higher. During the process, install a resource that requires admin permissions to the cluster. Run this to log in as admin: oc login -u system:admin Copy Check that webhooks are correctly configured. If they are not, update the master-config.yaml file. admissionConfig: pluginConfig: MutatingAdmissionWebhook: configuration: apiVersion: apiserver.config.k8s.io/v1alpha1 kubeConfigFile: /dev/null kind: WebhookAdmission ValidatingAdmissionWebhook: configuration: apiVersion: apiserver.config.k8s.io/v1alpha1 kubeConfigFile: /dev/null kind: WebhookAdmission location: \"\" Copy Important Add kubeConfigFile: /dev/null to address some issues in Openshift. Enable certificate signing by editing the YAML file and updating your configuration: kubernetesMasterConfig: controllerArguments: cluster-signing-cert-file: - \"/etc/origin/master/ca.crt\" cluster-signing-key-file: - \"/etc/origin/master/ca.key\" Copy Restart the Openshift services in the master node. Configure the injection of metadata By default, all the pods you create that include APM agents have the correct environment variables set and the metadata injection applies to the entire cluster. To check that the environment variables have been set, any container that is running must be stopped, and a new instance started (see Validate the injection of metadata). This default configuration also uses the Kubernetes certificates API to automatically manage the certificates required for the injection. If needed, you can limit the injection of metadata to specific namespaces in your cluster or self-manage your certificates. Default configuration To proceed with the default injection of metadata, follow these steps: Download the YAML file: curl -O http://download.newrelic.com/infrastructure_agent/integrations/kubernetes/k8s-metadata-injection-latest.yaml Copy Replace YOUR_CLUSTER_NAME with the name of your cluster in the YAML file. Apply the YAML file to your Kubernetes cluster: kubectl apply -f k8s-metadata-injection-latest.yaml Copy Custom configuration You can limit the injection of metadata only to specific namespaces by using labels. To enable this feature, edit your YAML file by finding and uncommenting the following lines: # namespaceSelector: # matchLabels: # newrelic-metadata-injection: enabled Copy With this option, injection is only applied to those namespaces that have the newrelic-metadata-injection label set to enabled: kubectl label namespace YOUR_NAMESPACE newrelic-metadata-injection=enabled Copy Manage custom certificates To use custom certificates you need a specific YAML file: Download the YAML file without automatic certificate management: curl -O http://download.newrelic.com/infrastructure_agent/integrations/kubernetes/k8s-metadata-injection-custom-certs-latest.yaml Copy Replace YOUR_CLUSTER_NAME with the name of your cluster in the YAML file. Apply the YAML file to your Kubernetes cluster: kubectl apply -f k8s-metadata-injection-custom-certs-latest.yaml Copy Once you have the correct YAML file, you can proceed with the custom certificate management option. You need your certificate, server key, and Certification Authority (CA) bundle encoded in PEM format. If you have them in the standard certificate format (X.509), install openssl, and run the following: openssl x509 -in CERTIFICATE_FILENAME -outform PEM -out CERTIFICATE_FILENAME.pem openssl x509 -in SERVER_KEY_FILENAME -outform PEM -out SERVER_KEY_FILENAME.pem openssl x509 -in CA_BUNDLE_FILENAME -outform PEM -out BUNDLE_FILENAME.pem Copy If your certificate/key pair are in another format, see the Digicert knowledgebase for more help. Create the TLS secret with the signed certificate/key pair, and patch the mutating webhook configuration with the CA using the following commands: kubectl create secret tls newrelic-metadata-injection-secret \\ --key=PEM_ENCODED_SERVER_KEY \\ --cert=PEM_ENCODED_CERTIFICATE \\ --dry-run -o yaml | kubectl -n default apply -f - caBundle=$(cat PEM_ENCODED_CA_BUNDLE | base64 | td -d '\\n') kubectl patch mutatingwebhookconfiguration newrelic-metadata-injection-cfg --type='json' -p \"[{'op': 'replace', 'path': '/webhooks/0/clientConfig/caBundle', 'value':'${caBundle}'}]\" Copy Important Certificates signed by Kubernetes have an expiration of one year. For more information, see the Kubernetes source code in GitHub. Validate the injection of metadata In order to validate that the webhook (responsible for injecting the metadata) was installed correctly, deploy a new pod and check for the New Relic environment variables. Create a dummy pod containing Busybox by running: kubectl create -f https://git.io/vPieo Copy Check if New Relic environment variables were injected: kubectl exec busybox0 -- env | grep NEW_RELIC_METADATA_KUBERNETES NEW_RELIC_METADATA_KUBERNETES_CLUSTER_NAME=fsi NEW_RELIC_METADATA_KUBERNETES_NODE_NAME=nodea NEW_RELIC_METADATA_KUBERNETES_NAMESPACE_NAME=default NEW_RELIC_METADATA_KUBERNETES_POD_NAME=busybox0 NEW_RELIC_METADATA_KUBERNETES_CONTAINER_NAME=busybox Copy Disable the injection of metadata To disable/uninstall the injection of metadata, use the following commands: Delete the Kubernetes objects using the yaml file: kubectl delete -f k8s-metadata-injection-latest.yaml Copy Delete the TLS secret containing the certificate/key pair: kubectl delete secret/newrelic-metadata-injection-secret Copy Troubleshooting Follow these troubleshooting tips as needed. No Kubernetes metadata in APM or distributed tracing transactions Problem The creation of the secret by the k8s-webhook-cert-manager job used to fail due to the kubectl version used by the image when running in Kubernetes version 1.19.x, The new version 1.3.2 fixes this issue, therefore it is enough to run again the job using an update version of the image to fix the issue. Solution Update the image k8s-webhook-cert-manager (to a version >= 1.3.2) and re-run the job. The secret will be correctly created and the k8s-metadata-injection pod will be able to start. Note that the new version of the manifest and of the nri-bundle are already updated with the correct version of the image. Problem In OpenShift version 4.x, the CA that is used in order to patch the mutatingwebhookconfiguration resource is not the one used when signing the certificates. This is a known issue currently tracked here. In the logs of the Pod nri-metadata-injection, you'll see the following error message: TLS handshake error from 10.131.0.29:37428: remote error: tls: unknown certificate authority TLS handshake error from 10.129.0.1:49314: remote error: tls: bad certificate Copy Workaround Manually update the certificate stored in the mutatingwebhookconfiguration object. The correct CA locations might change according to the cluster configuration. However, you can usually find the CA in the secret csr-signer in the namespace openshift-kube-controller-manager. Problem There is no Kubernetes metadata included in the transactions' attributes of your APM agent or in distributed tracing. Solution Verify that the environment variables are being correctly injected by following the instructions described in the Validate your installation step. If they are not present, get the name of the metadata injection pod by running: kubectl get pods | grep newrelic-metadata-injection-deployment kubectl logs -f pod/podname Copy In another terminal, create a new pod (for example, see Validate your installation), and inspect the logs of the metadata injection deployment for errors. For every created pod there should be a set of 4 new entries in the logs like: {\"level\":\"info\",\"ts\":\"2020-04-09T12:55:32.107Z\",\"caller\":\"server/main.go:139\",\"msg\":\"POST https://newrelic-metadata-injection-svc.default.svc:443/mutate?timeout=30s HTTP/2.0\\\" from 10.11.49.2:32836\"} {\"level\":\"info\",\"ts\":\"2020-04-09T12:55:32.110Z\",\"caller\":\"server/webhook.go:168\",\"msg\":\"received admission review\",\"kind\":\"/v1, Kind=Pod\",\"namespace\":\"default\",\"name\":\"\",\"pod\":\"busybox1\",\"UID\":\"6577519b-7a61-11ea-965e-0e46d1c9335c\",\"operation\":\"CREATE\",\"userinfo\":{\"username\":\"admin\",\"uid\":\"admin\",\"groups\":[\"system:masters\",\"system:authenticated\"]}} {\"level\":\"info\",\"ts\":\"2020-04-09T12:55:32.111Z\",\"caller\":\"server/webhook.go:182\",\"msg\":\"admission response created\",\"response\":\"[{\\\"op\\\":\\\"add\\\",\\\"path\\\":\\\"/spec/containers/0/env\\\",\\\"value\\\":[{\\\"name\\\":\\\"NEW_RELIC_METADATA_KUBERNETES_CLUSTER_NAME\\\",\\\"value\\\":\\\"adn_kops\\\"}]},{\\\"op\\\":\\\"add\\\",\\\"path\\\":\\\"/spec/containers/0/env/-\\\",\\\"value\\\":{\\\"name\\\":\\\"NEW_RELIC_METADATA_KUBERNETES_NODE_NAME\\\",\\\"valueFrom\\\":{\\\"fieldRef\\\":{\\\"fieldPath\\\":\\\"spec.nodeName\\\"}}}},{\\\"op\\\":\\\"add\\\",\\\"path\\\":\\\"/spec/containers/0/env/-\\\",\\\"value\\\":{\\\"name\\\":\\\"NEW_RELIC_METADATA_KUBERNETES_NAMESPACE_NAME\\\",\\\"valueFrom\\\":{\\\"fieldRef\\\":{\\\"fieldPath\\\":\\\"metadata.namespace\\\"}}}},{\\\"op\\\":\\\"add\\\",\\\"path\\\":\\\"/spec/containers/0/env/-\\\",\\\"value\\\":{\\\"name\\\":\\\"NEW_RELIC_METADATA_KUBERNETES_POD_NAME\\\",\\\"valueFrom\\\":{\\\"fieldRef\\\":{\\\"fieldPath\\\":\\\"metadata.name\\\"}}}},{\\\"op\\\":\\\"add\\\",\\\"path\\\":\\\"/spec/containers/0/env/-\\\",\\\"value\\\":{\\\"name\\\":\\\"NEW_RELIC_METADATA_KUBERNETES_CONTAINER_NAME\\\",\\\"value\\\":\\\"busybox\\\"}},{\\\"op\\\":\\\"add\\\",\\\"path\\\":\\\"/spec/containers/0/env/-\\\",\\\"value\\\":{\\\"name\\\":\\\"NEW_RELIC_METADATA_KUBERNETES_CONTAINER_IMAGE_NAME\\\",\\\"value\\\":\\\"busybox\\\"}}]\"} {\"level\":\"info\",\"ts\":\"2020-04-09T12:55:32.111Z\",\"caller\":\"server/webhook.go:257\",\"msg\":\"writing response\"} Copy If there are no new entries on the logs, it means that the apiserver is not being able to communicate with the webhook service, this could be due to networking rules or security groups rejecting the communication. To check if the apiserver is not being able to communicate with the webhook you should inspect the apiserver logs for errors like: failed calling webhook \"metadata-injection.newrelic.com\": ERROR_REASON Copy To get the apiserver logs: Start a proxy to the Kubernetes API server by the executing the following command in a terminal window and keep it running. kubectl proxy --port=8001 Copy Create a new pod in your cluster, this will make the apiserver try to communicate with the webhook. The following command will create a busybox. kubectl create -f https://git.io/vPieo Copy Retrieve the apiserver logs. curl localhost:8001/logs/kube-apiserver.log > apiserver.log Copy Delete the busybox container. kubectl delete -f https://git.io/vPieo Copy Inspect the logs for errors. grep -E 'failed calling webhook' apiserver.log Copy Remember that one of the requirements for the metadata injection is that the apiserver must be allowed egress to the pods running on the cluster. If you encounter errors regarding connection timeouts or failed connections, make sure to check the security groups and firewall rules of the cluster. If there are no log entries in either the apiserver logs or the metadata injection deployment, it means that the webhook was not properly registered. Ensure the metadata injection setup job ran successfully by inspecting the output of: kubectl get job newrelic-metadata-setup Copy If the job is not completed, investigate the logs of the setup job: kubectl logs job/newrelic-metadata-setup Copy Ensure the CertificateSigningRequest is approved and issued by running: kubectl get csr newrelic-metadata-injection-svc.default Copy Ensure the TLS secret is present by running: kubectl get secret newrelic-metadata-injection-secret Copy Ensure the CA bundle is present in the mutating webhook configuration: kubectl get mutatingwebhookconfiguration newrelic-metadata-injection-cfg -o json Copy Ensure the TargetPort of the Service resource matches the Port of the Deployment's container: kubectl describe service/newrelic-metadata-injection-svc kubectl describe deployment/newrelic-metadata-injection-deployment Copy",

      "body": "We've written these guidelines to make it easier for you to contribute to our docs, as well as to give you some insight into how we think about good technical writing. We, the Tech Docs team, rely on your expertise to keep New Relic's documentation updated and useful. Thank you for your willingness to share your knowledge! Our style guide focuses on style and usage that's particular to our site. Our site follows American English conventions. For topics that aren't covered, please refer to the Microsoft Writing Style Guide (for guidelines on technical terminology) or the Chicago Manual of Style (for general writing and editing guidelines). Organize your doc to make it easier to read Consider these organization guidelines when thinking about the order of information in a doc. By following these guidelines, you'll make it easier for readers to skim and find what they need. How to organize information Comments Separate what and why from how. Define any necessary prerequisites, policies, or background information (the what and the why) before you step through the how (step-by-step procedures). Examples: Explain what the feature is and why it matters before telling readers how to use it. Describe any limitations with user permissions or subscription levels that would prevent them from using the feature. If the feature is available for any user or subscription level, don't bother to say so. Provide a roadmap for what users will be able to accomplish, so they know before starting a procedure that they have everything they need. Front-load directions with context. Make sure readers know where they need to be, before telling them what to do. In general, use (select an app) to describe what users select from the product index. Examples: Go to one.newrelic.com > Explorer > (select an app or service). Select (account dropdown) > User preferences. On the command line, type gitk. Also, structure steps by front-loading context from the user's point of view. For example, instead of \"Go to x to do y,\" structure the step as \"To do y, go to x.\" Separate requirements from options. Example: Type the Email you use to sign in and to receive information from New Relic. Optional: Type additional user emails, separated by commas. Follow the \"five to nine\" guideline. Depending on the topic, organize the information so there is a maximum of five to nine chunks of information. For example, readers may start to get lost or overwhelmed after about five h2 sections or seven steps into a procedure. If you have more than nine h2 sections or steps, you might need to create an additional doc or procedure. Other organization tools to consider: Levels of headings Lists Collapsers Callouts Tables Code examples For more help section Use action-oriented titles Wherever possible, give your document or h2 heading a task- or action-oriented title. Focus on what users are trying to accomplish or the problem they're trying to solve. Use present-tense verbs, rather than \"-ing\" verbs. Quality Title example Bad The query history Okay View query history Good Query history: Create and edit NRQL queries Start the document with an introductory paragraph Unless the document is less than a single screen in length, begin with a brief paragraph that introduces the topic or summarizes the important points. Not sure where to start? Try writing all the content for your document first, and then add the introduction to the top to summarize your key points. Or use the introduction to expand on the text in your metaDescription in the metadata. Keep documents short The amount of content needed can help you decide whether you need one or more documents for the topic. If all of the document's contents apply directly to the title, then everything belongs in the same document. If several related sections could be logically split into individual documents, and the overall length of your document is more than about two screenfuls, split those sections into other documents. Be sure to include links to the related contents. If a large document needs to be broken into multiple smaller documents, consider whether they might be best grouped together in their own sub-category. Use the New Relic voice We strive for a voice that's approachable, expert, and visionary. Check out our voice guidelines for how to write content with these qualities. And keep in mind these essential writing tips that apply to any type of documentation. Guidelines Comments Be clear and direct. Remember to: Use present tense. Use active voice; avoid passive voice. Tell users what to do, not what they \"should\" do. If absolutely necessary, tell users what not to do in situations where unexpected results may occur. Whenever possible, provide an alternative suggestion when telling users what not to do. Example: Using active voice with an alternative suggestion for what not to do Do not use your config file to change this setting, because this could affect other processes. Instead, go to one.newrelic.com > APM > (select an app or service) > Settings > Application. Write to aid localization and translation. Do not use euphemisms, idioms, jargon, or slang. Use the same terms and wording consistently. If you need to include an abbreviation or acronym, spell it out the first time it appears in the document. Always take a moment to ask yourself whether people will really understand the terms you are using in the way you're using them. Change doc titles and anchors Because changes to doc titles, anchors, and redirects can break links to other docs, please create an issue to request these types of changes and we'll help you out with that. Create and edit categories Because changes to categories can affect large groups of docs at once, please create an issue to request these types of changes and we'll help you out with that.

To learn how to create and publish release notes, see Create release notes. To make it even easier to start a new doc, use templates.",

      "body": "When you're creating a new doc, there's a lot to keep track of. You can use this checklist to make sure you've done everything. Title Check that: The doc's title effectively describes the contents. Procedural doc titles use active verbs; for example, Install not Installing. Introduction Check that: The introduction leads with an outcome and provides an overview of how to get there, so customers are confident they've found the right doc. It provides a short, readable overview of the doc's contents. Headings (H2s) Check that: Heading names are concise, yet provide information that helps readers to skim or skip to the section they want. Procedural H2s use active verbs, not the ing verb form. Text Check that the text: Optimizes for easier translation: Avoid idioms, slang, specific cultural references, etc. Tells a good story: Promotes the platform (other New Relic products, alerting, etc.). Includes examples and use cases, identifies personas, explains not only what it is or how to use it but why it matters. Includes hyperlinks in UI paths. Has no typos. Procedures Procedures use active voice and focus on steps (\"do this\"). Avoid burying tips or extra details in the steps. If the procedure includes prerequisites or background information, that information appears before (not buried inside) the ordered list of procedures. If a procedure or step branches, it splits the options so they are clearly visible as bullets, collapsers, etc. If the procedure says what not to do, it also describes what to do instead. Example: What not to do and what to do instead Do not monitor your own applications from the partnership owner account. Instead, create an account within the partnership, and monitor apps from that account. Structure The original tech writer or docs site contributor is the best judge of whether the draft doc is complete. However, in your peer edit, make notes if you have unanswered questions that aren't addressed within the doc or its cross references. Doc structure Comments Complete Check that the overall doc: Is complete, but stays on topic. Includes useful cross references, hyperlinks, and other suggestions to enhance the information, especially for SEO. Skimmable Readers can see at a glance what the doc is about and what to do. It's obvious what parts they can read and what parts they can skip. Visually clean The doc avoids excessive use of callouts, long sentences, or long paragraphs. Useful images For screenshots and images, check that: Full size images always have captions to explain their relevance. UI paths in captions always have hyperlinks. Cropped images clearly show their relevance, with or without captions. In addition, make sure that screenshots and images follow the docs site's security guidelines, and that no private information related to customers or New Relic is displayed. Levels of detail The doc uses H2s, H3s, bullets, tables, and clamshells to organize complex levels of information.",

Use sentence case in headings Use sentence case for headings. This includes category headings and document titles. With sentence case, capitalize only the first letter of: The first word Proper nouns Acronyms and abbreviations We have some exceptions: If the heading is a code term, such as a variable or function, then capitalize it exactly as it's used in the code; for example: noticeError. If the heading includes a colon, follow the Microsoft Style Guide for titles and headings, and capitalize the first word that appears after the colon; for example: APM Error profiles: Troubleshoot trends. Important Use sentence case for graphical illustrations such as diagrams and figures. Explore our Screenshots and images document for more information on our image guidelines. Products and features Item Example We use title case for products. Full Stack Observability We don't capitalize features (including features that used to be products).

      "body": "This is a template. Feel free to copy the formatting tips in this template to organize the docs you create on the docs site. Then replace the template information with your own text, lists, and tables as needed. Before you create sections, start your doc with a brief introduction, usually no more than a paragraph, that helps readers understand what your doc will cover. Your introduction (and the structure of your doc) should help readers understand within ten seconds whether they are in the right place. Section example Begin each section with a meaningful H2 title. The docs site uses these to generate the contents, which appears automatically in the left navigation. If you want to include a screenshot with the section, provide a permalink for the Docs team to create the image for you. Due to security requirements, the Docs team manages all images on the docs site. Code example def article_url(category, article, options={}) url_for(options.reverse_merge( :controller => 'articles';, :action => 'show', :category => category, :article => article )) end Copy List example For multi-step, actionable procedures, use ordered lists (ol in HTML or numbers in Markdown). For example: Add require('newrelic'); as the first line of your app's main module. Use the command npm install newrelic --save for each application you want to monitor. For unordered lists, use bullets (ul in HTML or * in Markdown). For example: Black White For complex lists, consider using collapsers. Table example Tables help organize detailed lists so the information is easier to skim. Tables are easier to manage in HTML. For exammple: <table> <thead> <tr> <th width={200}> **Item** </th> <th> **Requirements** </th> </tr> </thead> <tbody> <tr> <td> Some thing </td> <td> More detailed information about it </td> </tr> <tr> <td> Another thing </td> <td> More detailed information about another thing </td> </tr> </tbody> </table> Copy Tables created in Markdown use three or more hyphens --- to create each column’s header, and pipes | to separate each column. For example: | Item | Requirements ------------ | ------------ | Some thing | More detailed information about it | Another thing | More detailed information about another thing Copy",

Then, clone this doc using the Clone content link in the Page tools box. Delete all content up to Introduction (this heading won't be visible). For the doc title (the field at top of page): Doc should be named in a practical, use-case-focused way. Example: Add custom attributes to transactions Introduction (this heading will not be visible) Provide a brief explanation of what this document will teach customers, and why it is valuable for customers to know how to do that. Focus on the value the API provides to the customers and mention specific, common use cases. Any relevant notes about support/compatability should go here, too. Here's an example from the Java API asynchronous tutorial doc: New Relic for Java includes an API to instrument asynchronous activity. For supported frameworks, the Java agent usually instruments async work automatically. However, the async API can be useful for adding more detail to your data. This document provides examples of using tokens and segments to instrument your app. Optional: Provide an overview for complex processes This is an optional section for complicated tutorials that involve either using several methods in one procedure or that have different alternate steps you can take to achieve similar results. This section can link to lower-down sections to allow users to skip around as needed. For simple tutorials, this section isn't necessary. For an example, see this section of the Java async tutorial. Provide a procedure to accomplish the task Tell the user how to accomplish the task, and link to the methods necessary to accomplish that task. As much as possible, we're looking to describe tasks in \"procedures\" (procedure is tech writer jargon for a series of numbered steps). This may be tough to do for fairly open-ended/variable tasks, but it will usually be possible to chunk the content at a fairly high-level to make it into a procedure. Along the way, explain what the importance of the procedure step is, and how one might verify that the step was done correctly. For code samples, avoid using large chunks of code. Instead, use smaller pieces of code and give context for how they are being used. (If you think a large app code example would be helpful, place that later in the doc in the Example section.) Tip For an example of an open-ended task segmented into procedural chunks, see the Asynchronous doc section Connecting async threads. For another example, see this TomCat GAE Flex procedure. Base your procedure on the simple structure below. Tech writers will edit your content to match our style and formatting requirements: Step 1. Do something... Methods and example code to implement the first step. For each step, if applicable, indicate the significance of that step (why it's important) and how the user might verify that the step was done correctly (for example, something showing up in UI, or running a verification test of some sort). If needed: Step 2. Do something else... Methods and example code to implement step 2. If needed: Step 3. Do something else... Methods and example code to implement step 3. Last step. Verify that the task was completed... Explain how a user would know they'd completed the task correctly. In particular, how would the user find the new change or data in the New Relic UI. What NR products and pages would the change be noticed on? If new data shows up in Insights, what event types can it be found under? Optional: Do something else with the API Same as above. Make as many headings and separate procedures as needed. Optional: Large example code block If you think a large app code example would be useful, place here. Within any code block, explain all New Relic functions/methods, not just the main methods. Instead of in-line comments, consider using highlighted sections underneath the code block to give additional context. Here's an example: Code block example The following code example shows a segment starting in the storeItem method to measure how long the Lambda statement is waiting in the thread pool. To stop timing the segment, you must call either .end() or .ignore(). If you don't want to report the segment as part of its parent transaction, call .ignore(). Otherwise, to report the segment as part of its parent transaction, call .end(). private void storeItem(long id) { Segment segment = NewRelic.getAgent().getTransaction(). startSegment(\"storeItem\") ; segment. reportAsExternal (DatastoreParameters .product(\"H2\") .collection(null) .operation(\"insert\") .instance(\"localhost\", 8080) .databaseName(\"test\") .build()); // fire and forget DB_POOL.submit(() -> { segment.end(); insertData(id); }); } Copy The agent API calls in this sample are: startSegment(...): Begins the segment that will time the code. For more on this method, see the Javadoc. reportAsExternal(DatastoreParameters()): Associates the time with a datastore external call This will show up in APM with datastore data. For more information, see reportAsExternal API. segment.end(): Stops timing this segment. For more on this method, see the Javadoc.

Note that account hierarchy may affect queried data. See Account structure. Available data types Usage data is attached to these events: NrConsumption records usage every hour, and is the equivalent of \"real-time\" usage. Use this event to observe usage trends over time. NrMTDConsumption generates aggregate values from the NrConsumption event. Use this event to see usage or estimated cost for a billing period. NrUsage records usage every hour and is used to see usage reported per product. To see changes made to your account (for example, user management changes), you can query NrAuditEvent. Query examples The View your usage UI displays your data usage and billable user count. If you need more detail than that UI provides, you can use these NRQL queries. For definitions of some of the attributes used in these queries, see Attributes. Data usage queries Here are some data usage query examples: Daily data usage This query totals your billable ingested data, and displays a daily value for the past three months: FROM NrConsumption SELECT sum(GigabytesIngested) WHERE productLine = 'DataPlatform' SINCE 3 months ago TIMESERIES 1 day Copy Daily usage by source This query totals your billable ingested data, and displays a daily value for the past three months faceted by the source: FROM NrConsumption SELECT sum(GigabytesIngested) WHERE productLine = 'DataPlatform' SINCE 3 months ago FACET usageMetric TIMESERIES 1 day Copy Metrics ingest by source This query breaks down Metric data by the top ten metric names. You could also facet by appName or host to adjust the analysis. FROM Metric SELECT bytecountestimate()/10e8 as 'GB Estimate' SINCE '2021-04-01' UNTIL '2021-04-08' FACET metricName LIMIT 10 TIMESERIES 1 day Copy Month-to-date data usage This query shows the current full user count. In other words, it shows how much you'd be billed for your data for that month if you were billed right now. FROM NrMTDConsumption SELECT latest(GigabytesIngested) WHERE productLine = 'DataPlatform' SINCE this month Copy Month-to-date estimated data cost This query shows the estimated cost of your ingested data: FROM NrMTDConsumption SELECT latest(estimatedCost) WHERE productLine = 'DataPlatform' SINCE this month Copy User count queries Here are some user-related query examples. For details on how users are counted, see User count calculations. Month-to-date full users This query shows the billable full users for the month. In other words, it shows how much you'd be billed for your users for that month if you were billed right now. FROM NrMTDConsumption SELECT latest(usersBillable) SINCE this month Copy This query shows how many full users were counted by hour. This is useful for seeing how the full user count changed over time. from NrConsumption SELECT max(FullUsers) SINCE 10 days ago TIMESERIES 1 hour Copy Projected monthly full user count This query shows a projected count of monthly users. This query would not be good for using in a dashboard; it requires values based on a) the days remaining in the month, b) the start of the month. Here's an example querying the projected end-of-month count with 10 days left in that month: FROM NrMTDConsumption SELECT predictLinear(FullUsers, 10 days) SINCE '2020-09-01' Copy Count full users and basic users The usage UI shows the count of full users and basic users. The query used is: FROM NrUsage SELECT max(usage) SINCE 10 days ago WHERE productLine='FullStackObservability' WHERE metric in ('FullUsers', 'BasicUsers') FACET metric Copy To see the count of full and basic users over time: FROM NrUsage SELECT max(usage) SINCE 10 days ago WHERE productLine='FullStackObservability' WHERE metric in ('FullUsers', 'BasicUsers') FACET metric TIMESERIES 1 hour Copy Set usage alerts To help manage your billable data, you can set alerts to notify you of unexpected increases in usage. Learn how to create alerts with NRQL queries here. Caution When creating alert conditions, you should set the Evaluation offset value to 60 minutes or your conditions may not trigger. Here are some NRQL alert condition examples. For attribute definitions, see Attributes. Ingested gigabytes exceed a fixed value This query will create an alert when your hourly usage exceeds a fixed value: FROM NrConsumption SELECT sum(GigabytesIngested) WHERE productLine = 'DataPlatform' Copy If you have multiple child accounts, you may want to set threshold alerts for a specific subaccount: FROM NrConsumption SELECT sum(GigabytesIngested) WHERE productLine = 'DataPlatform' AND consumingAccountId = YOUR_CHILD-ACCOUNT_ID Copy Usage exceeds fixed threshold for GBs This query will create an alert when your usage exceeds fixed monthly threshold for GBs: FROM NrMTDConsumption SELECT latest(GigabytesIngested) WHERE productLine = 'DataPlatform' Copy Usage exceeds fixed threshold for users This query will create an alert when your usage exceeds fixed monthly threshold for billable users: FROM NrMTDConsumption SELECT latest(usersBillable) Copy Usage exceeds fixed threshold for estimated cost This query will create an alert when your usage exceeds fixed threshold for estimated cost: FROM NrMTDConsumption SELECT latest(estimatedCost) WHERE productLine = 'DataPlatform' SINCE this month Copy Available attributes Below are some of the important attributes attached to usage events.

      "body": "An explanation of how New Relic One pricing works, and how to view and manage billing. Important This document explains the New Relic One pricing plan. If you’re on our original pricing plan, see Original pricing. Not sure which you're on? See Overview of pricing. How the New Relic One pricing plan works Starting July 30, 2020, all of our new customers are on a pricing plan that we call New Relic One pricing. Customers on our original pricing plan are able to transition to this pricing. For New Relic One pricing, billing is based on these factors: The amount of data ingested. 100 GBs per month is free. $0.25 per GB ingested above that. The number of provisioned full users, defined as users with access to Full Stack Observability features. Basic users are free. The cost of each full user depends on your edition: Standard, Pro, or Enterprise. Standard edition includes one full user for free, and a max of five. Pro and Enterprise give access to more account and user management features, more support, longer data retention, and other features. For Applied Intelligence, our intelligent alert/detection system: the number of incident events above the free 1000 per month. (Note that our alerting functionality is available for free and doesn't count towards this limit.) For a summary of what's included for free, see Free edition. For an overview of pricing, see our Pricing page. Keep reading for details about New Relic One pricing and billing. Billing and usage in the UI For how to view and manage billing and usage in the UI, see Pricing and billing UI. If you need more detail than the usage UI shows, you can also run queries of your usage data and set up alerts. Billing calculation details For accounts on New Relic One pricing, some high-level billing information is displayed in the UI. Here are some more details about how billing works: Data usage calculation One pricing factor is your ingested data. In this context, “ingested” refers to the data actually saved to your account after we apply various data trimming and data transformation rules. In other words, it’s not the size of the raw data sent to New Relic, but the size of the data that actually ends up stored. To view and manage your usage, go to the usage UI. Other calculation details: In the context of our pricing plan, a GB is defined as 1 billion bytes. Monthly data ingested is rounded down to the nearest integer. For example, if your account uses 100.9 GBs during a month, that’s counted as 100 GBs. For more on how data is ingested, see Manage data ingest. For how to query usage, see Query and alert on usage. Incident Intelligence events One billing factor is how many incident events your organization sends to Incident Intelligence for correlation and analysis. If your organization is on New Relic One pricing, Incident Intelligence comes with a certain number of free incident events per month. (Our original pricing plan doesn't have a free tier.) You can track usage and cost in two places in the UI: In the usage UI From the Incident Intelligence system settings UI page: From one.newrelic.com, click Alerts & AI, then click Incident Intelligence, and then click System settings. Determine event source When you set up Incident Intelligence data sources, the incident events ingested by those sources are what count towards your total. To see the sources affecting your billing, go to the Sources page: From one.newrelic.com, click Alerts & AI, click Incident Intelligence, and then click Sources. Stop reporting events Go to the Incident Intelligence Sources UI page and disconnect all the sources you don’t want. If all sources are removed, no data is sent to Incident Intelligence. Full user count billing details For accounts with New Relic One pricing, the monthly count of provisioned full users is one billing factor. To give an example: if you're on the Pro pricing edition and your organization has 100 full users during the month of January, you'd be billed for 100 full users for that month. A full user counts as a billable user the moment they're added to a New Relic organization (provisioned), whether or not that user has logged into or used New Relic yet. A user's user type is meant to be long-term setting determined by a user's expected New Relic duties and responsibilities. Because user type is a billing factor, we have restrictions around how often a full user can be downgraded to a basic user: a full user can downgrade to a basic user a maximum of two times in a rolling 12-month period. If a full user has been changed to a basic user two times in that 12-month period, that user won't be able to return to being a basic user until the start of the next 12-month period. To learn reasons for assigning one user type or another, see Tips on assigning user type. Here are more user-related billing details and caveats: You can see your full user count in the UI. We de-duplicate users based on email address. If there are multiple users in an organization that have the same email address, those user records count as a single user for billing purposes. The count of full users is prorated based on the start of a New Relic subscription, or based on when a user is created as a full user or converted to a full user. A New Relic user can have a maximum of either three concurrent active sessions, or three unique IP addresses in use at any given time. For organizations on our original user model that have a parent/child account structure, the count of billable users in the UI may differ from the users you can see. For more on this, see User count discrepancy. The Standard edition of the New Relic One pricing plan includes one free full user. For organizations on our original user model, because the organization-related settings aren't as robust as on our newer model, a user may be set as a basic user in one account and as a full user in another account. In such cases, the full user status takes precedence and that user is considered a full user. For how to query usage data, see Query and alert on usage. For more on user capabilities, see Users and roles. Data retention See Data retention. Billing periods For pay-as-you-go customers, billing occurs at the end of the month (UTC), and you can see this tracked in the UI. When you input your credit card and start to be charged, your end-of-month bill will take into account all activity (billable data usage and users) that occurred since the beginning of that month. For example: if you input your credit card in the middle of the month, and so far at that point your account has 200 GBs of usage for that month, that 200 GBs counts towards your end-of-month bill. For how to query user-related usage, see Query and alert on usage. Usage plan details There are two New Relic One pricing usage plans: Pay-as-you-go: This plan bills at the end of each month. There are no commitments and you can cancel at any time. For details, see Usage plans. Annual pool of funds: This plan applies to some customers who have subscribed for a year or more. For details, see Usage plans. For some frequently asked questions, see Pricing FAQs. Query and alert on usage data To create detailed queries of your usage, and get notifications when you are close to hitting certain usage levels, see Query usage data. Free tier If your organization is on New Relic One pricing and on the Standard pricing edition for Full Stack Observability, you can use New Relic free, forever, if you stay under the free allowed limits. Here's a summary of what Standard edition gets access to for free: A single account (Pro and Enterprise Full Stack Observability editions can have multiple accounts per organization). Up to 100 GBs of ingested data per month. One full user, and unlimited basic users. Access to alerts and Applied Intelligence (up to 1,000 Incident Intelligence events per month). To upgrade to Pro or Enterprise, or to learn more about pricing, see New Relic pricing. Non-profit use of New Relic If you’re a non-profit and want to use New Relic at special pricing, see our Non-profit eligibility docs. Cancel or downgrade See Downgrade account.",

      "body": "When you're creating a new doc, there's a lot to keep track of. You can use this checklist to make sure you've done everything. Title Check that: The doc's title effectively describes the contents. Procedural doc titles use active verbs; for example, Install not Installing. Introduction Check that: The introduction leads with an outcome and provides an overview of how to get there, so customers are confident they've found the right doc. It provides a short, readable overview of the doc's contents. Headings (H2s) Check that: Heading names are concise, yet provide information that helps readers to skim or skip to the section they want. Procedural H2s use active verbs, not the ing verb form. Text Check that the text: Optimizes for easier translation: Avoid idioms, slang, specific cultural references, etc. Tells a good story: Promotes the platform (other New Relic products, alerting, etc.). Includes examples and use cases, identifies personas, explains not only what it is or how to use it but why it matters. Includes hyperlinks in UI paths. Has no typos. Procedures Procedures use active voice and focus on steps (\"do this\"). Avoid burying tips or extra details in the steps. If the procedure includes prerequisites or background information, that information appears before (not buried inside) the ordered list of procedures. If a procedure or step branches, it splits the options so they are clearly visible as bullets, collapsers, etc. If the procedure says what not to do, it also describes what to do instead. Example: What not to do and what to do instead Do not monitor your own applications from the partnership owner account. Instead, create an account within the partnership, and monitor apps from that account. Structure The original tech writer or docs site contributor is the best judge of whether the draft doc is complete. However, in your peer edit, make notes if you have unanswered questions that aren't addressed within the doc or its cross references. Doc structure Comments Complete Check that the overall doc: Is complete, but stays on topic. Includes useful cross references, hyperlinks, and other suggestions to enhance the information, especially for SEO. Skimmable Readers can see at a glance what the doc is about and what to do. It's obvious what parts they can read and what parts they can skip. Visually clean The doc avoids excessive use of callouts, long sentences, or long paragraphs. Useful images For screenshots and images, check that: Full size images always have captions to explain their relevance. UI paths in captions always have hyperlinks. Cropped images clearly show their relevance, with or without captions. In addition, make sure that screenshots and images follow the docs site's security guidelines, and that no private information related to customers or New Relic is displayed. Levels of detail The doc uses H2s, H3s, bullets, tables, and clamshells to organize complex levels of information.",

Read on for some guidelines on how to decide what to capitalize in a document's title, headings, products, features, and other elements of the page. Use sentence case in headings Use sentence case for headings. This includes category headings and document titles. With sentence case, capitalize only the first letter of: The first word Proper nouns Acronyms and abbreviations We have some exceptions: If the heading is a code term, such as a variable or function, then capitalize it exactly as it's used in the code; for example: noticeError. If the heading includes a colon, follow the Microsoft Style Guide for titles and headings, and capitalize the first word that appears after the colon; for example: APM Error profiles: Troubleshoot trends. Important Use sentence case for graphical illustrations such as diagrams and figures. Explore our Screenshots and images document for more information on our image guidelines. Products and features Item Example We use title case for products. Full Stack Observability We don't capitalize features (including features that used to be products). Use transaction traces to... not Use Transaction Traces to... Our infrastructure monitoring... not Our Infrastructure monitoring...

Update your CLI Before you run any commands, ensure that you have the latest version of the CLI: bash Copy $ nr1 update Check your permissions To publish your Nerdpack and update its catalog information, you need: Access to the account that published it The necessary permissions for managing Nerdpacks Publish your Nerdpack You need to publish Nerdpacks that you create before you can update their catalog information. Update your Nerdpack's catalog metadata After you've published your Nerdpack to the New Relic One catalog, update the Nerdpack's metadata to let users know all about your Nerdlets or visualizations. Step 1 of 9 Go to New Relic: Step 2 of 9 Navigate to Apps: Step 3 of 9 Find your published Nerdpack under New Relic One catalog: Notice that there is no information on the Apps or details page other than the Nerdpack's name and the brief description found in nr1.json: There are no screenshots, icons, details, or what's new features. For these, you need to provide catalog information to your Nerdpack. Step 4 of 9 From the root of your Nerdpack, create catalog directories to house your Nerdpack's screenshots and metadata: bash Copy $ nr1 create --type catalog ✔ created: launchers/launcher/catalog ✔ created: nerdlets/home/catalog ✔ catalog created successfully! catalog is available at \"./catalog\" Inside your root catalog directory, you'll find specific files and directories for portraying information about your Nerdpack to your users: bash Copy $ ls catalog README.md additionalInfo.md config.json documentation.md screenshots File Description README.md A markdown file that instructs you how to use the information and metadata in catalog config.json A JSON file that contains the following fields: tagline: A brief headline for the application. This cannot exceed 30 characters. repository: The URL for the Nerdpack's remote repository. This cannot exceed 1000 characters. details: The purpose of the Nerdpack and how to use it.

Background On July 30, 2020, we released a new and improved user model called the New Relic One user model. This newer model offers a simpler, more efficient way to manage users and their access to roles and accounts. At first, this new model was available mainly to new customers, while users in pre-existing New Relic organizations remained on our original user model. But now some original-user-model organizations that meet some requirements can use a migration wizard to migrate their users to the new model. When that migration process is complete, your users are on the New Relic One user model and you’ll have new procedures for managing your users and their access to accounts. Benefits When you migrate your users to this model, benefits include: Viewing and managing all users from multiple accounts in one place. Fewer steps to add and manage users. Flexible authentication options. More granular roles for user management. For Enterprise customers: access to automated user management via identity providers. Learn more about the benefits of the new model. Requirements Requirements include: You must be on the original user model. If you aren't sure which you are, see Determine user model. To use the user migration wizard, you must have the Owner role. Recommendations and considerations We have some recommendations below that apply to organizations who choose to do the user migration on their own. Note that these considerations won't apply if you're being helped by a New Relic representative; in that case, your account representative will give you guidance. We recommend not using the user migration wizard in these circumstances: If your organization has more than 20 accounts (unless you're getting help from a New Relic representative). Note that this refers to having 20 or more accounts, not users. If you frequently add accounts. Currently, users on the new user model require New Relic assistance to add accounts. If you think any of the new user model impacts and limitations might affect you negatively. If you require account-level roles for user management capabilities. Roles related to user management (ability to add and update users, change user type, create access grants) currently apply across an organization and can't be assigned at an account level. If you have questions about whether you should use the user migration wizard, talk to your New Relic account representative. Understand user management concepts During the user migration procedure, you'll have a choice to either grant all your users access to all your organization's accounts, or to assign more granular access (set the roles and accounts your user groups have access to). The more you need to partition access to accounts or roles, the more it will help you to understand some basics about the newer user management concepts. Here's a brief summary: Users are grouped in a container called an \"authentication domain\". The domain governs how users are added to New Relic (manually with the UI or automatically via SCIM). It also governs how users log in (manually with email/password or using SAML SSO). Most organizations will have just one or two authentication domains: one for the default manual settings and another for the more automatic methods. Users can be assigned to one or more groups (for example, our default Admin group or a custom group like Contractors). For large organizations, users are often assigned to multiple groups. When you want to give a user group access to a specific role and a specific account, you must create an access grant. For example, you may give a Contractors group access to our default All product admin role on one or more of your accounts, or give that group a custom role. To learn more, see User management concepts. Optional: plan out user groups and access grants If you'll need to do a good amount of partitioning of users' access to accounts or roles, you'll want to think about how you'll implement groups for your organization. Here are some tips for how different types of organizations may use groups: For organizations with a good number of accounts, a common configuration is to have one user group with the Organization manager role (organization-level management capabilities), one group with the Authentication domain manager (user management capabilities), a group with the Billing user (billing-related capabilities) on the primary (first) account, and then configuring various users groups for admins, users, and other roles as needed on your other accounts. Customers with smaller and/oor flatter organizations that are okay with transparency for all teams across all of their data could have as little as one or two groups. For organizations where all data is in a single account, a common configuration might be having five or six groups. Migrate your users with the migration wizard Before you start, be sure you've read the requirements. To start using the wizard: From one.newrelic.com, click Apps in the top navigation. In the table of apps, click the User migration walkthrough app. Optional: If you want more help and context, see the sections below for tips and recommendations for specific migration wizard pages. If you've successfully completed migration, learn how to manage your users. Step 1: Create admins Tips: You can either a) import all current admins for your account or b) specify the admins that should have access to user management capabilities. Note that you can add more admin users and edit permissions after you complete the migration process. If you've already used the wizard to set up an admin on the new user model, have the admin sign in using their new user record to access the migration tool. The user migration wizard, when completed, destroys the old user record, but if you've started the user migration process without completing it, you may have users with access to both the original and new record, as shown below: If a user on the new model has been created and the migration process hasn't been completed, they may have access to both the original user record and the new user records. If you plan on migrating only a portion of your users to the new user model to start, we recommend leaving some original user model admins so that you have an admin to manage your users on the original model. Step 2: Set up organization You may choose a) a guided setup that allows more configuration options, or b) an automatic setup with fewer steps. Some notes on the automatic setup: It won't transition SSO or AUM-implemented SCIM configurations. Instead, users will be provisioned manually and will log in manually with their username and password. It provides all users with access to all accounts. If you use SSO or AUM today or require some accounts to be inaccessible by certain user groups, don't use the automatic option. Step 3: Name your organization Name your organization something descriptive and easily recognizable. Step 4: Authentication domain settings This section controls how users are provisioned (added to New Relic) and how they authenticate (log in). Note that choosing SAML SSO or SCIM setup will require you to exit the migration wizard and configure things elsewhere in the New Relic UI. Here's more detail about the two authentication domain sections: Managing users For how users are added and managed, you can select Manually or Identity provider. The option to use your identity provider to provision users is available only if your organization has Enterprise edition. If you choose Identity provider, you must follow additional steps for using specific identity providers. Once you do that, these users are created on the new user model and synced in New Relic based on your identity provider configuration. Note that if you're already using an app made by Okta, Azure, or OneLogin, you'll probably need to use a newer version made for New Relic's newer user model. For more on this, see Identity provider apps. After you complete provisioning users, you can confirm that these users have been added by seeing if they’re in the new User management UI. If you’ve selected the guided workflow, we’ll match these users by email address. There will be no need to later complete the user import step for these users given they’ll have been brought into New Relic via your identity provider. When done, you can skip ahead to the Migrate assets step. Login methods If you chose Manually for managing users, you have a choice for how those users log in. You can select either a) email/password login or b) single sign on (SSO). Note that SSO is available only for organizations with Pro or Enterprise edition. You can select multiple authentication methods based on your needs. For example, you might use SSO for your employees and username/password for contractors. If you select SSO, you must complete additional configuration steps. You can complete the procedure for setting up SSO, and then come back to the migration wizard to continue the migration process. If you select more than one authentication method, note that you’ll need to add a new authentication domain. Note that if you're already using an identity provider's New Relic app, you'll probably need to use a newer version made for New Relic's newer user model. For more on this, see Identity provider apps, below. A note about identity provider apps Okta, Azure, and OneLogin have New Relic apps for both the original user model and the New Relic One user model. The original apps are titled \"New Relic by account\" while the newer apps are titled \"New Relic by organization.\" If you're already using one of the New Relic apps, it's likely made for the original user model, which means you'll need to set up a new app. Step 5: Import existing users Recommended: Download the full list of existing original user model users before choosing to import users. This will be a useful resource and serve as a backup, if you need it. After downloading your original user model users, you can upload all users or just some of them. This step will create user records on the New Relic One user model. In a later step, you’ll be able to transition these users' assets. The new user record that's created has the same login credentials: there is no need to reset passwords. If a user has a pending email verification status (pending being verified), that will also be transitioned over. Important tips: Ensure the new users' email addresses match their original user record email addresses, including matching exact case. We use email addresses as the key value to match users and, in a later step, to transition their user-associated assets. Once you complete this step and create new user records, we highly recommend completing the migration process without delay. If you don't complete the steps to migrate assets and delete the original user record, a user may see two user records when logging in (see login screenshot from Step 1) or else may be missing assets they expect to see (like dashboards). Step 6: Access settings This step allows you to determine the level of access your users have. If you need to map user access to specific accounts and roles, then you'll want to set up groups and access grants at this stage. You'll need to create an access grant for each account that you want a group to have access to. For example, a DevOps group might have five different access grants, each giving the group access to a different account. This procedure is done separately from the user migration wizard procedure. For more on how to create access grants, see the user management tutorial. Step 7: Migrate user assets Upon completion of this step, personal assets, such as dashboards and favorites, are migrated to new user records and the original user record is deleted. If a user has access to several organizations (for example, if that user is a contractor), the user won't be fully deleted until all organizations migrate their users. It's possible that such a user will find themselves with both the original user record and new user records (see login screenshot in Page 1 section). Step 8: Review and finish If you're migrating users in chunks and not all at once, you can go through the migration workflow several times with different groups of users. You can only click Finish Setup when all users in the organization are migrated. After you're done Once your users are migrated to the new user model, you can find and manage them by clicking the account dropdown, clicking Administration, and using these UI pages: User management: use this to view and add users, change their type (basic versus full), change their group, and approve user upgrade requests. Organization and access: use this to create access grants (granting groups access to roles and accounts), and configure authentication domains (SAML SSO settings and SCIM settings, and more). For more about these tools, see the new user management docs.",

      "body": "Your New Relic users can be on one of two user models: this doc explains the New Relic One user model. Important If your New Relic organization was created before July 30 2020 and you haven't gone through a user migration process, your users are likely on our original user model. For more on this, see User model changes. Overview This doc will explain the structure of the New Relic One user model, including: User type (basic user versus full user) Default user groups, including Admin and User Roles and capabilities For how to add and manage users in the UI, see User management. User type: basic and full Important This section is for users on our New Relic One user model. If you're on our original user model, see Original users. The user type (basic user or full user) determines whether a user has access to our Full Stack Observability features. A user's type is something you set long-term based on that user's expected New Relic responsibilities. Below are details on the two user types. Note that billing-related aspects only apply if you're on New Relic One pricing. Basic user. Details: These users are free and have access to a wide range of features, including setting up and configuring any New Relic data-reporting tool, running queries of your data, using our logs UI, making custom charts and dashboards, and setting up alerts. Unlike full users, they do not have access to our Full-Stack Observability features and some Applied Intelligence features (for a detailed comparison, see Capabilities). Basic users will see prompts to become a full user when they attempt to access unavailable features. For details, see Upgrade. Full user. Details: Full users have access to our Full-Stack Observability features, which include curated UI experiences like APM, infrastructure monitoring, browser monitoring, mobile monitoring, synthetic monitors, access to New Relic One apps, and more. For details, see Capabilities. Standard edition includes one free full user and up to five total full users. A full user can downgrade to a basic user twice in a 12-month period. To see and edit a user's user type, use the User management UI. Learn more about basic user versus full user differences: Compare full vs basic capabilities Below is a table comparing what basic users and full users can do. In short: basic users have access to our Telemetry Data Platform and some Applied Intelligence features, while full users have theoretical access to everything (dependent on any group-related restrictions). Another way to think about this is that full users are users with access to Full Stack Observability, which gates our more curated UI features. Features Full user Basic user Full-Stack Observability (Curated UI experiences) Application performance monitoring (APM) UI Infrastructure monitoring UI Digital Experience Monitoring UI, which includes: Browser monitoring UI Mobile monitoring UI Synthetic monitoring UI Synthetics checks Serverless monitoring UI Logs in context Distributed tracing Infinite Tracing (Pro and Enterprise edition) Assorted UI experiences, including: Kubernetes cluster explorer UI Key transaction UI Workloads UI Manage other users Access to New Relic One apps Can build apps but can't access other apps Applied Intelligence Automatic anomaly detection Correlated alerts and events Anomaly/alert analysis Root cause details in issues Telemetry Data Platform Data ingest from any source (agents, integrations, APIs) Query your data Create custom charts and dashboards Alerts and notifications Our APIs, including NerdGraph (GraphQL) (with some restrictions) Query and chart log data Build New Relic One apps (but cannot access other apps) Encryption at rest Standard data retention Security and compliance Data management Note that the pricing edition (Standard, Pro, or Enterprise) will also affect what features you have access to. For organizations with New Relic One pricing, learn more about how full users impact billing. Tips on choosing user type A user's type (basic user vs full user) is meant to be a long-term assignment, based on the New Relic responsibilities that user is expected to perform. A full user can be downgraded to a basic user only twice in one year. Below are tips for why you'd choose full user versus basic user. Reasons to make someone a full user: They play a key role in the development, testing, deployment, and maintenance phases of the application development lifecycle. They break/fix code regularly; they are responsible for triaging workflows, troubleshooting, or managing users and roles for their team. They have DevOps practices (i.e. version control systems and implement CI/CD). They need to use New Relic's curated dashboards and experiences (not just the ability to create their own custom queries and charts); in other words, they need full access to our platform. They need to be able to manage users and/or billing. Reasons to make someone a basic user: They play a key role in the planning phase of the application development lifecycle. They use and configure New Relic agents, APIs, and integrations to send us data, and access, configure, and use alerts on such data (not necessarily responsible for triaging workflows, troubleshooting, or managing users and roles for their team). They want to see high-level analytics and business metrics for future planning (such as C-Suite executives). They do not need to use our curated experiences and dashboards, but would benefit from the ability to create their own custom queries and charts of data; in other words, they don't need full access to the platform. They don't manage users. For accounts on New Relic One pricing, learn more about user-related billing calculations. Understand user-related billing If you're on the New Relic One pricing plan, full users are billable, and there are restrictions around how often a full user can downgrade to a basic user. For details, see User count billing details. For how to query and alert on usage data, see Query usage data. Have questions about why you can't access something? See Factors affecting access. Default groups: Admin and User For users on our New Relic One user model, a \"group\" is what allows the grouping together and managing of multiple users at the same time. Your New Relic users are assigned to a group, and that group is granted access to specific roles on specific accounts. We have two default groups: User: This group allows a user to use and configure monitoring/analysis features but not perform account-related tasks like managing billing or users. It has access to the All product admin role, which gives access to our observability platform tools but not to the organization and user management capabilities governed by the Organization manager and Authentication manager roles. Admin: has full access and capabilities, including the organization-level admin abilities. This is the equivalent of having the All product admin, the Billing user, the Organization manager and the Authentication domain manager roles. These groups are added inside your default authentication domain, which includes the default settings of users a) being managed via New Relic and b) logging in via standard email and password. If you add other authentication domains (for SAML SSO and/or SCIM provisioning of users), you'd have new custom groups in those new domains to govern those users. Note that groups, whether default or custom, are not what limit a user's capabilities: it is the role that is assigned to that group (with any basic user restrictions on top of that). If your organization is Pro or Enterprise edition and you want to understand how users are granted access to specific roles and accounts, see Access grants. To change the group a user is in, use the User management UI. How do user type, roles, and groups relate to each other? For users on the New Relic One user model, here's a table explaining how user type (basic vs full user), roles, and groups relate to each other: Full user Basic user Group Full users can be assigned to default groups (User and Admin) or custom groups. When basic users are added to a group, that group's role-related restrictions apply. A basic user's capabilities can be restricted in that way, but a basic user can never be granted more capabilities than they start with. For Standard edition, basic users can't be assigned to groups. For Pro and Enterprise edition, they can. Role For an explanation of the roles our default groups have, see Default groups. Custom groups can have either our default standard roles, or custom roles. A basic user's abilities aren't directly defined by a specific role. A basic user can best be described as having the All product admin role but without access to Full Stack Observability features (learn more about user type). When basic users are added to a group, that group's role-related restrictions apply, but a basic user can never be granted more capabilities than they start with. Roles and capabilities For users on the New Relic One user model, a \"role\" can be defined as \"a set of capabilities.\" A capability is defined as the ability to do a specific New Relic task, like 'Delete alert conditions' (learn more about capabilities). Roles are assigned to user groups. Our default groups Admin and User already have our standard roles (defined below) assigned. Organizations on Pro or Enterprise edition can also create custom roles. Standard (default) roles Roles are sets of capabilities. We have several \"standard roles,\" which are roles that satisfy some commonly needed use cases. To view roles and their associated capabilities, use the Organization and access UI. Important Note that some of our standard roles have hidden, non-exposed capabilities that are not available for selection when creating a custom role. The only standard roles that can be replicated with a custom role are Standard user and Read only; all others have some hidden capabilities. Our standard roles include: Standard roles Scope Description All product admin Account Provides admin-level access to observability platform features but not organization-level and user management features. In other words, this role includes all New Relic capabilities with the exception of managing users (Authentication domain manager role), managing organization/account-structure settings (Organization manager role), and managing billing (Billing user role). Note: the Standard user role is essentially the All product admin role minus observability feature configuration capabilities. Standard user Account Provides access to observability platform features, but lacks permissions for configuring those features (for example, ability to configure synthetic monitor secure credentials) and lacks organization-level and user management permissions. Note: the Standard user role is essentially the All product admin role without that role's ability to configure platform features. Billing user Account Provides ability to manage subscriptions and billing setup, and read-only access to the rest of the platform. For organizations with multiple accounts, billing is aggregated in the primary (first-created) account, which is why assigning this role to that primary account grants billing permissions for the entire organization. Organization manager Organization Provides the ability to manage organization settings, including organization structure, name, and preferences. Due to our recent switch to the New Relic One user model, this role currently has few abilities but more will be added over time. For how to grant this role, see Add user management capability. Organization read only Organization Provides the ability to view organization-level settings. For how to grant this role, see Add user management capability. Authentication domain manager Organization Provides ability to add and manage users, and configure authentication domains for users on the New Relic One user model. For how to grant this role, see Add user management capability. Authentication domain read only Organization Provides the ability to view users in your organization and view the configuration of authentication domains. For how to grant this role, see Add user management capability. Read only Account Provides read-only access to the New Relic platform (except for synthetic monitor secure credentials). Manage v1 users Account For New Relic organizations that existed before July 30 2020 and have users on our original user model, this role lets you manage those \"v1\" users. For more about how you'd assign roles to groups and create custom roles, see the user management tutorial. Capabilities A role, whether one of our standard roles or a custom role, is defined as a set of capabilities. To view roles and their associated capabilities, use the Organization and access UI. Important Some of our standard roles have hidden capabilities that aren't available for selection when creating a custom role. For details, see Standard roles. A view of the capabilities associated with the All product admin role. When creating a custom role, you select a custom set of capabilities. Note that the capabilities we expose may change over time: this screenshot was taken in April of 2021. For how to set up roles with custom capabilities, see the user management tutorial. Manage users To learn how to add users, assign them to groups, and create custom groups and roles, see Manage users. 2020 user model changes If you'd like to understand how our user model changed in 2020 and what the impacts of that change were, see User model changes.",

      "body": "We use this dictionary to ensure consistency across our docs site. Other than the terms listed here, we generally follow the Microsoft Style Guide, but we'll use Chicago Manual of Style in a pinch. We also follow American English conventions, rather than British English ones. For a glossary of terminology specific to New Relic, see the public glossary on the docs site. account ID A unique number that identifies a particular New Relic account. Don't use account number. agent Don't capitalize. Install the Ruby agent, not Install the Ruby Agent. Don't refer to a Synthetics private minion as an agent. am and pm Use the 12-hour clock followed by the (lowercased) time period am or pm. Don’t put a space after the last number in a timestamp (12:00am, not 12:00 am). Don't include a leading 0 when the hour is less than 10. 9:30am, 12:30pm, 8:30pm Copy Amazon Web Services (AWS) product names Refer to the specific product, not just AWS broadly. As a courtesy to your readers, on first mention always refer to Amazon products by their full names; for example Amazon Web Services (AWS). You can use the acronym after that, if there is one. Example: Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud. After that, use the short name according to the AWS Documentation site. Example: Amazon EC2. app name vs. app alias The \"machine name\" that the collector uses to uniquely identify an app is its app name. The server-side configuration setting that changes the visible \"name\" of an app without changing its unique identifier is its app alias. beta Use the beta callout. In the body text, use lowercase. For example: BETA FEATURE This feature is currently in beta. If the developer team prefers to use a term other than beta or private beta, clarify what is driving that use of the term (Legal requirement?), and add any relevant info here in the usage dictionary. bits and bytes Use standard prefixes and capitalization for International System of Units (SI), International Organization for Standardization (ISO), or Joint Electron Device Engineering Council (JEDEC memory) values when referring to multiples of bits (b) and bytes (B). 1 byte = 8 bits. Decimal value SI prefix Binary value ISO prefix JEDEC prefix 1000 k: kilo 1024 Ki: kibi K: kilo 1000^2 M: mega 1024^2 Mi: mebi M: mega 1000^3 G: giga 1024^3 Gi: gibi G: giga 1000^4 T: tera 1024^4 Ti: tebi - -- 1000^5 P: peta 1024^5 Pi: pebi - -- Tip For help with converting byte values (such as bytes to kilobytes), try this byte converter. blacklist and whitelist Don't use. Instead, use deny list and allow list; for example, \"Add a hostname to your deny list.\" capitalization This is more complex than can be covered in this usage dictionary. For detailed information, see: Heading capitalization Capitalization of features and UI elements Child account A parent account contains one or more child accounts. Child accounts were previously referred to as \"sub-accounts\". click In general, use click rather than the vaguer select. For example, you might click something in the UI, but then select something from a list. Be particularly careful to use click to describe actions that only make sense with a mouse; for example, with a right click or a click and drag. Also use click when the user must click on a non-selectable object (to save your changes, click anywhere outside the dialog box). See also [mouse over] #mouse-over). collector vs. connect to New Relic When referring to an agent talking to the New Relic servers, describe this as the New Relic collector. Although internally the collector refers only to specific parts of our architecture, we use it more broadly in our documentation to mean \"any endpoint a customer must connect to report data, for any product.\" Avoid \"connect to New Relic,\" and do not use \"connect to the New Relic UI.\" contractions When it makes sense for clarity, conciseness, and tone and voice, use contractions. Use them where they make the writing sound more like natural speech, and where they improve clarity and accessibility without sacrificing expertise and authority. There are no hard and fast rules for which contractions are or aren't acceptable, but simple and common is preferable to complicated and rare. For example, it's for it is is fine, but less common constructions like mustn't or wouldn't've are best avoided. Also: When using a negative contraction (don't, can't, won't) try to provide some additional info about what what to do and what can be done. (See the style guide intro for more on this.) There are places in our docs—for example, in notes and warnings—where spelling out do not, cannot, or will not is preferable to contractions to emphasize the action or blockage to be avoided. customer vs. user When possible, use the second person you to form a sense of connection with the reader. For times when you need a descriptive third-person noun, keep the following guidelines in mind: customer and user are both appropriate depending on context. customer makes more sense when talking about billing, or about a group of people or a business entity. For example, one customer may have one or more individual users who interact with New Relic through the customer's account(s). user makes more sense as a general term for an individual user, or when talking about users as an object in the account model. For example, when discussing account models, it's important to be specific about what constitutes a single person identity in our system. dashboard Don't use. Instead, use page. doc, document, documentation, docs site If you need to refer to the docs themselves—don't. Generally it's better to directly link to the doc you're referencing and use the doc title as your link text. For example, See [Install the .NET agent](URL) rather than See our [.NET agent install docs](URL). If there's not a good alternative, doc generally sounds more natural than document or documentation. If you're tempted to use a longer form, try reading it aloud to see which reads best. If you must refer to the site as a whole, call it the docs site rather than Docs site or documentation site. Internally, you can also refer to the whole URL docs.newrelic.com to avoid ambiguity with other sources of docs like internal platform docs or API explorer docs. To refer to our docs GitHub repo, use the repo name docs-website or the repo path newrelic/docs-website. dropdown Use dropdown instead of drop-down or drop down. Although it isn't common usage, you can use dropdown independently as a noun, without needing to say dropdown menu or dropdown list. For example, select a date from the <b>date</b> dropdown. e.g. and i.e. Don't use Latin abbreviations. Instead of e.g., use for example or such as. Instead of i.e. or its English equivalent in other words, rewrite so your description is clear. em dash (—) Em dashes are rarely needed in tech docs, sadly. You can usually accomplish what you need to by breaking the thought into multiple sentences or using parentheses. In some rare cases, though, an em dash can add drama and spice. If you think you've found such a case, make sure you use them right. An em dash should always use the real em dash character (not a hyphen), and no space before and after. For example: You can sign up for New Relic fast and free—we won't even ask for a credit card number. Copy You can insert an em dash with the COMMAND+OPTION+- shortcut or use the HTML entity. etc. Unlike the Latin abbreviations e.g. or i.e.), you're welcome to use etc. Please ensure that you have several meaningful examples, though, before using. For example, cities including Portland, Seattle, Dublin, etc. but not cities including Portland, etc.. hostname This is one word. Don't hyphenate. icons When using an inline icon from the UI, always describe it first, then embed the icon image, and then end with the word icon. For example, select the delete icon. Don't put icons in bold. When writing about icons, describe the icon for its purpose or action, not what the icon looks like. For example: Yes: Select the edit icon. No: Select the pencil icon. For technical information on embedding images, see Inserting inline images and Embedding Font Awesome icons. index A list of entities, such as the APM applications index, the Synthetics Monitors index, or the Alerts Incidents index. See also page. infrastructure Don't use, unless referring to the New Relic Infrastructure product. Instead, use an appropriate substitute such as architecture, environment, system, host, etc. introduction Always use Introduction to for overview docs for a particular product. For example, Introduction to New Relic Infrastructure or Introduction to the PHP agent or Introduction to transaction traces. Don't use welcome to, basics, intro, overview, etc. Also avoid the Thing: Tagline format, as in X-Ray sessions: Traces and thread profiles for key transactions, unless having a title with keywords will help with SEO. macOS The proper name for Apple's desktop operating system is macOS. Don't use the older product names Mac OS X or OS X. master account We previously used \"master account\" and \"sub-account\" but now we use parent account and child account. menu The list of pages and indexes on the top and left sides of the New Relic user interface. mouse over For mouse movements that involve placing the mouse pointer over an area, but not clicking it. For example, the APM Overview page includes functions that are only visible when the mouse pointer is over a particular chart. Do not use point to or hover over. See also click. .NET Always refer to the agent and language as .NET, never as .Net or .net or dotnet. New Relic One New Relic One isn't a product. It's a way to view New Relic data more easily, all in one place, and from multiple related accounts. This has several implications for how we should refer to it: Avoid phrasing that makes New Relic One sound like a separate product or a separate platform. There is a single New Relic platform through which our users interact with our products. Avoid mentioning New Relic One where it can be avoided. For example, instead of saying \"Use New Relic One workloads to...\", you could instead say, \"In New Relic, you can use workloads to...\" and then in the doc explain where to find the feature. Another example: instead of referring to \"The programmable New Relic One platform,\" we might say, \"The New Relic platform is programmable: To start building, go to one.newrelic.com and...\" Do not use NR1 or nr1 as an abbreviation of New Relic One. The only reason to use nr1 is when referring to the nr1 package or library (for example: a reference to the command nr1 nerdpack:serve). In general, we want to avoid overloading our docs with \"New Relic\". For more details, see the New Relic One messaging guidelines, the docs glossary entry, or the New Relic One docs. Node.js Always refer to the programming language as Node.js, not Node. NR ONLY Use NR ONLY for internal consumption only (such as this style guide). Don't use NR-ONLY or NRONLY or New Relic Only. Oxford comma See serial comma. open source Use lower case for open source. Some legal contracts may require upper case. page A specific place in the New Relic UI, located at a particular URL. Compare and contrast index, menu, and UI. Don't use dashboard, menu, tab, screen, or similar terms. parent account New Relic organizations can have a parent/child account structure. This is more important for our original user model but still plays a role for some behind-the-scenes features on our New Relic One user model. Learn more about account structure. Parent accounts were previously referred to as master accounts, and there are still some uses of this in the codebase. permissions See User-related language. For pricing tier/edition language, see Pricing language. pricing See Pricing language. real user monitoring (RUM) Don't use this outside of browser monitoring docs. Often abbreviated as RUM, this is a generic industry term for browser monitoring. New Relic refers to this as page load timing or browser monitoring. Use this term only for SEO or clarification, not to refer to the actual feature. record vs. report vs. collect Use report when discussing data sent to New Relic, such as, \"your host reports data to New Relic.\" Avoid using report as a noun. Instead use \"the reported metrics\" or \"the collected data.\" If \"report\" sounds too clunky, you can also use collect as long as whatever New Relic is collecting doesn't sound security sensitive. RPM Don't refer to the New Relic UI as RPM. Always refer to the specific product, such as the APM UI or the Browser UI. However, you may use rpm when required in the visible URL string in UI paths. serial comma Also referred to as an Oxford comma. Always use serial commas with inline lists. For example, Portland, Seattle, and Dublin rather than Portland, Seattle and Dublin. time zone Include a space (time zone). Don't hyphenate or run together as timezone. UI The graphical component of a New Relic product, encompassing all its pages, menus, and indexes. See also UI paths. UI paths If you need to tell a user how to path through the UI, see our style guide page on UI paths. update vs. upgrade Use update when users need to change the version of whatever they're using. No money or payment is needed for an update. Use upgrade whenever money or payment may be involved, such as upgrading to the Pro version of a product. The new pricing model makes it unlikely that you'll need to use this. users For styles and formats related to user roles and groups and more, see User-related style. username, not user name One word (username), not two. This is the most common usage and is recommended by Microsoft and Google style guides. version number references When referring to multiple version numbers, always use or higher. Don't use and higher, or the words greater or later. Also don't use punctuation, as in version 1.2+. For example: Foo requires Ruby agent version 1.2.3 or higher. Copy In addition: Tell users to use the latest version and not an up-to-date or current version. To abbreviate the word version, use a lowercase v with no space before the number; for example, v2 or v1.2.3. Use update not upgrade when talking about agent versions, as in \"To update to the latest version...\" For security reasons, do not use version numbers with licensing docs. The Tech Docs team doesn't have a set standard when referring to previous versions. Recommendation: Consider using version x.x or lower when identifying a specific version. Consider using In earlier agent versions when referring to versions more vaguely. we Say “we” and “our” when it works with the flow of your writing. Avoid overloading paragraphs with “New Relic” mentions, or reword so the focus is on the user, not New Relic. For example, avoid writing something like this: New Relic recommends setting a startup timeout. Copy Instead, write something like this: Recommendation: To help with troubleshooting, include a startup timeout in your configuration. Copy OR We recommend setting a startup timeout. Copy you We use “you” and “your” liberally in our docs. Addressing the reader directly makes for simpler, cleaner sentences. It also tends to expose lazy uses of passive construction and it helps users to understand procedures.",

View synthetic monitoring SLA reports To view your account-wide SLA report: Go to one.newrelic.com > Synthetics > SLA Report. Choose from reports aggregated by day, week, or month by selecting Daily, Weekly, or Monthly as appropriate. You can also view SLA reports for individual monitors: Go to one.newrelic.com > Synthetics > (select a monitor) > SLA. one.newrelic.com > Synthetics > SLA Report: Use SLA reports to understand your monitors' performance over time. Understand SLA report metrics Use SLA reports to view aggregated performance metrics for a single monitor, or for all your monitors from the account-wide SLA Reports page. SLA reports include the following metrics: Duration: The average duration across all monitor results. Uptime: The percentage of all monitor results that ended successfully. For example, Monitor A might check 50 times per day, and Monitor B might check 150 times per day. If Monitor A has 29 successes out of 50 and Monitor B has 148 successes out of 150, the Uptime would be 88.5: (29+148)/(50+150)=88.5 For individual SLA reports, the uptime score only includes the selected monitor. Apdex: The average Apdex across all monitors. Monitors have a default Apdex T of 7 seconds, but you can customize Apdex T for individual monitors by editing their settings. Apdex F, which defines a frustrating result, is always four times Apdex T. For more information about Apdex, see Apdex: Measuring user satisfaction. For individual SLA reports, the Apdex score only includes the selected monitor. % Satisfied: The percentage of monitor results which complete in a \"satisfying\" time. A satisfying time is defined as a monitor result that completes in Apdex T or less. % Toleration: The percentage of monitor results which complete in a \"tolerable\" time. A tolerable time is greater than Apdex T, but less than Apdex F (four times Apdex T). % Frustrated: The percentage of monitor results which complete in a \"frustrating\" time. A frustrating time is greater than Apdex F (four times Apdex T). The account-wide SLA report includes all monitor types (ping, simple browser, scripted browser, and API test). Use page functions SLA reports support the following features: If you want to... Do this... View the report in Excel or an external program Select Download this report as .csv to download a copy of your SLA data. Open the file in Excel, Google Drive, or another spreadsheet editor to analyze your data. Change your Apdex targets The default Apdex T for all monitors is 7 seconds. You can customize your Apdex T target for individual monitors by editing your monitor. Change the time frame Choose from daily, weekly, or monthly aggregation by selecting the appropriate tab. Make the report public Change the Public SLA setting to ON to allow non-authenticated users to view the report. Select Share Report to get the public URL to share. Generate SLA values The values in the SLA report are generated from Insights queries against the available synthetic monitoring data. You can easily recreate these values and modify the queries to meet your needs. This query returns the average duration, the apdex, and the uptime. Substitute your values for the variables highlighted and described below. SELECT average(duration), apdex(duration, t:), percentage(count(*), WHERE result='SUCCESS') FROM SyntheticCheck FACET timeperiod Copy Variable Value t: Supply the Apdex T that you would like to calculate your apdex against. The duration attribute in the SyntheticCheck event is stored in milliseconds, so an Apdex T value of 7 seconds should be included as 7000. timeperiod This is the period that you would like to calculate on. For a daily report, facet on dateOf(timestamp), for a weekly report facet on weekOf(timestamp) and for a monthly report facet on monthOf(timestamp). NRQL queries default to querying against the last hour of data. In order to widen the scope of your data you will need to include a SINCE clause at the end of your query. Example #1: Daily report for the last week To generate a daily report for the last week you would add SINCE 1 week ago: SELECT average(duration), apdex(duration, t:), percentage(count(*), WHERE result='SUCCESS') FROM SyntheticCheck FACET dateOf(timestamp) SINCE 1 week ago Copy Example #2: Report for a particular monitor To scope the results to a particular monitor you can edit the above query to include a specific monitor name: SELECT average(duration), apdex(duration, t:), percentage(count(*), WHERE result='SUCCESS') FROM SyntheticCheck FACET timeperiod WHERE monitorName = 'mymonitorname' Copy Example #3: Report for multiple monitors To scope the results to a collection of monitors: SELECT average(duration), apdex(duration, t:), percentage(count(*), WHERE result='SUCCESS') FROM SyntheticCheck FACET timeperiod WHERE monitorName IN ('mymonitor1', 'mymonitor2', 'mymonitor3') Copy For more help Additional documentation resources include: Access your monitors (view your list of monitors, and view current summary statistics for each monitor) Add and edit monitors (edit your monitor settings to customize Apdex targets for individual monitors) APM SLA reports (SLA reporting for your APM application)",

      "body": "Read on to learn about synthetic monitoring's proxy settings and properties. Proxy settings API for scripted monitors Important You can set proxy server configuration for synthetic scripted monitors for monitor versions 0.4.0 or higher. The global object $network allows you to control the network configuration used by your synthetic scripted monitors. The following are applicable for both scripted browsers and API tests, unless otherwise stated. $network.setProxy(string or object PROXY URL) Sets a proxy server to be used for all per-URL requests (HTTP, HTTPS, and FTP). Additional notes: The port is optional. If not provided, it will be derived from the scheme. For example, for HTTP the port would be 80. The username and password are assumed to be the result of a call to encodeURIComponent(). Special characters like @ and : in the username and/or the password must be escaped. Returns This method returns a Promise that will resolve once the configuration has been applied. Parameters Parameter Data Type Description proxyURL | proxyUrlParsed String or Object The URL to connect to the proxy server. A string containing a proxyURL (for example, http://proxy_host:8888) or a plain object in the same format as defined by Node's url.parse(urlString) method. Examples An example of setting a proxy server with HTTP protocol on port 1234 with no authentication: $network.setProxy('http://host.com:1234') Copy An example of setting a proxy server with HTTP protocol with authentication credentials. $network.setProxy('http://proxyUsername:proxyPassword@proxyHost:1234') Copy $network.setProxyForHttp(string or object PROXY URL) Tip This call is exactly the same as the per-URL setProxy call, except that it applies to HTTP traffic. Sets a proxy server to be used for all HTTP requests. Additional notes: The port is optional. If not provided, it will be derived from the scheme. For example, for HTTP the port would be 80. The username and password are assumed to be the result of a call to encodeURIComponent(). Special characters like @ and : in the username and/or the password must be escaped. Returns This method returns a Promise that will resolve once the configuration has been applied. Parameters Parameter Data Type Description proxyURL | proxyUrlParsed String or Object The URL to connect to the proxy server. A string containing a proxyURL (for example, http://proxy_host:8888) or a plain object in the same format as defined by Node's url.parse(urlString) method. Examples An example of setting a proxy server with HTTP protocol on port 1234 with no authentication: $network.setProxyForHttp('http://host.com:1234') Copy An example of setting a proxy server with HTTP protocol with authentication credentials. $network.setProxyForHttp('http://proxyUsername:proxyPassword@proxyHost:1234') Copy $network.setProxyForHttps(string or object PROXY URL) Tip This call is exactly the same as the per-URL setProxy call, except that it applies to HTTPS traffic. Sets a proxy server to be used for all HTTPS requests. Additional notes: The port is optional. If not provided, it will be derived from the scheme. For example, for HTTP the default port would be 443. The username and password are assumed to be the result of a call to encodeURIComponent(). Special characters like @ and : in the username and/or the password must be escaped. Returns This method returns a Promise that will resolve once the configuration has been applied. Parameters Parameter Data Type Description proxyURL | proxyUrlParsed String or Object The URL to connect to the proxy server. A string containing a proxyURL (for example, http://proxy_host:8888) or a plain object in the same format as defined by Node's url.parse(urlString) method. Examples An example of setting a proxy server with HTTPS protocol on port 1234 with no authentication: $network.setProxyForHttps('https://host.com:1234') Copy An example of setting a proxy server with HTTPS protocol with authentication credentials. $network.setProxyForHttps('https://proxyUsername:proxyPassword@proxyHost:1234') Copy $network.setProxyPAC(string PAC SCRIPT URL, object AUTH OBJECT) Sets a proxy server via a proxy auto-config (PAC) script and returns a promise. This function is only available for scripted browser monitors. Returns This method returns a Promise that will resolve once the configuration has been applied. Parameters Parameter Data Type Description scriptURL String The URL of the PAC script. authCredentialsMap Object Map of authentication credentials to be provided to the proxy server(s), keyed by the hostnames of the proxy server. Values of this map must be defined in the format {username: 'authUsername', password: 'authPassword'} Examples An example of setting a proxy server via a proxy auto-config (PAC) script: var authCredentialsMap = { 'example.com': {username: 'authUsername', password: 'authPassword'}, } Copy $network.setProxyAdvanced(object PROXY RULES OBJECT) Tip This method is Chrome-specific: it only applies to scripted browser monitor types. It can be used to allow for a more flexible and complex proxy configuration. In most cases, this method will not be needed. Sets the proxy configuration using the format supported by Chrome Extension API for Proxying. The input is a ProxyRules object, as defined by the Chrome Extension API to configures proxies. You can add authCredentials for proxies that need it. See Parameters for more details. Returns This method returns a Promise that will resolve once the configuration has been applied. Parameters Parameter Data Type Description ProxyRules Object Object The proxyRulesObject is a plain object that follows the format ProxyRules as defined by the Chrome Extension API to configures proxies. This object is \"flavoured\" to fit our runtime: users can define an additional property, authCredentials, for the Proxy server objects to provide authentication credentials for a specific proxy server. authCredentials is an object in the format {username: 'authUsername', password: 'authPassword'}. Examples Here's an example of creating a proxyRules with authCredentials: var proxyRules = { singleProxy: { host:\"example.com\", authCredentials: { username: 'authUsername', password: 'authPassword' } } }; Copy Here's an example of setting up a proxied network with mixed network zone assets: var proxyRules = {singleProxy: {host:\"http://entproxy.mycompany.com\"}, bypassList:['s3.amazonaws.com','*.localcdn.com'] } $network.setProxyAdvanced(proxyRules) Copy $network.clearProxy() Clears/removes the current proxy configuration. Returns This method returns a Promise that will resolve once the configuration has been applied. $network.getProxy() This method returns the current proxy configuration. It must be synchronized in a promise callback. Examples An example of synchronizing getProxy with $network.setProxy(); and $network.clearProxy();: var assert = require('assert'); $network.setProxy(\"http://user:password@myproxyurl.com\") .then(function () { console.log('Proxy configuration applied'); //Note: $network.getProxy() is not synchronized with the webdriver Control Flow. //To make sure we get the proxy configuration after the call to setProxy() above // succeeds we need to use a promise callback var proxyData = $network.getProxy(); console.log(proxyData); }) .then(function () { // Again: getProxy() is not synchronized with the Webdriver Control Flow: we //need this promise callback otherwise clearProxy() might be called before the call // to getProxy() above returns return $network.clearProxy(); }) .then(function () { console.log('Proxy configuration cleared'); // We need this promise callback for reasons explained above var proxyData = $network.getProxy(); assert.equal(proxyData.rules, null); }); Copy Proxy properties Important This proxy information applies only to these versions: API monitors: 0.4.0, 0.2.2, 0.2.1, 0.1.0 Scripted monitors: 0.1.0 In order to analyze and collect your HTTP traffic metrics, New Relic must ensure the traffic passes through a conceptual funnel. Our synthetic monitoring includes a software funnel component capable of analyzing the HTTP requests or responses and then recording the information. New Relic's scripted browser monitors (versions 0.4.x and lower) include a mechanism to do this analysis without needing an HTTP proxy, so you don't have to configure anything. New Relic's API test (versions 0.4.x and lower) provides an $http object that is pre-configured to make the requests pass through the internal HTTP proxy. This allows you to write your test without including any proxy settings. If you want to use some other way to generate HTTP traffic while still collecting the HTTP traffic metrics, you can use $env.PROXY_HOST and $env.PROXY_PORT. To record traffic metrics, be sure to include these properties in your script.

Understand SLA report metrics Use SLA reports to view aggregated performance metrics for a single monitor, or for all your monitors from the account-wide SLA Reports page. SLA reports include the following metrics: Duration: The average duration across all monitor results. Uptime: The percentage of all monitor results that ended successfully. For example, Monitor A might check 50 times per day, and Monitor B might check 150 times per day. If Monitor A has 29 successes out of 50 and Monitor B has 148 successes out of 150, the Uptime would be 88.5: (29+148)/(50+150)=88.5 For individual SLA reports, the uptime score only includes the selected monitor. Apdex: The average Apdex across all monitors. Monitors have a default Apdex T of 7 seconds, but you can customize Apdex T for individual monitors by editing their settings. Apdex F, which defines a frustrating result, is always four times Apdex T. For more information about Apdex, see Apdex: Measuring user satisfaction. For individual SLA reports, the Apdex score only includes the selected monitor. % Satisfied: The percentage of monitor results which complete in a \"satisfying\" time. A satisfying time is defined as a monitor result that completes in Apdex T or less. % Toleration: The percentage of monitor results which complete in a \"tolerable\" time. A tolerable time is greater than Apdex T, but less than Apdex F (four times Apdex T). % Frustrated: The percentage of monitor results which complete in a \"frustrating\" time. A frustrating time is greater than Apdex F (four times Apdex T). The account-wide SLA report includes all monitor types (ping, simple browser, scripted browser, and API test).

Average load size This chart shows the amount of data (in kilobytes or megabytes) consumed in each run of the monitor. For scripted monitors, the entire script is included in the average load size graph. For example, a monitor that loads three pages will measure the size of all assets on all three pages. If your site is static, the average load size will be very consistent. For dynamic sites such as a news site, the average load size will vary as your page content changes. Slowest results This lists the five slowest results for the selected time frame. To view the performance breakdown, select a result. Monitor downtimes This lists the most recent monitor downtime incidents. To view additional details, select a downtime incident. For more help Additional documentation resources include: Results (full list of monitor results) Resources page (load times for each element on a monitored page) Failures (list of downtime incidents, and individual downtimes for in-depth analysis)",

      "body": "Use the Synthetics REST API to create and manage synthetic monitors of all types: ping, simple browser, scripted browser, and API test monitors. All synthetic monitoring data is available via the REST API. To use the Synthetics REST API, you must have a user role that allows that capability and a user key. For an overview of all available New Relic APIs, see Intro to APIs. Features The newest version of the Synthetics API (v3) adds these features: Synthetics API (v3) Features Options field for POST and PUT request You can specify the options for SIMPLE and BROWSER type monitors, similar to the way these options are available in the UI. PATCH request You can update only the fields of a monitor you want to change, rather than having to specify the entire monitor entity in a PUT. You can also specify the OPTION, assuming you are using the appropriate type of monitor. More detail with 400 Bad Request errors As of v3, the Synthetics API attempts to return as much information as possible when a validation failure occurs. This will help you figure out what might be wrong with the request. The API runs all validations and returns any failed validation messages, rather than failing on the first validation error as occurred in previous API versions. Pagination Large API responses are properly paginated. You can also use NRQL queries to analyze past changes made via the API. Monitor types in API These are the monitor types and how they're referred to in the API: Monitor type API name Ping SIMPLE Simple browser BROWSER Scripted browser SCRIPT_BROWSER API test SCRIPT_API Use the API To use the Synthetics REST API, you must have the ability to manage synthetics monitors and use a user key (the REST API key won't work). This API can be used for all Synthetics monitors. (Additional API methods for scripted browser and API test monitors are also available to update the script associated with those monitors.) All Synthetics data is available via the API. API examples show cURL commands. For US-based accounts, use the following endpoint: https://synthetics.newrelic.com/synthetics/api Copy For EU-based accounts, use the following endpoint: https://synthetics.eu.newrelic.com/synthetics/api Copy Caution The Synthetics REST API limits an account's rate of requests to three requests per second. Requests made in excess of this threshold will return a 429 response code. Get all monitors To view a list of all the monitors in your New Relic account, send a GET request to $API_ENDPOINT/v3/monitors. For example: curl -v \\ -H 'Api-Key:$API_KEY' $API_ENDPOINT/v3/monitors Copy A successful request will return a 200 OK response. The data returned will be a JSON object in the following format: { \"monitors\": [ { \"id\": \"2a1bc369-7654-489d-918e-f6g135h7i2jk\", \"name\": \"monitor1\", \"type\": \"BROWSER\", \"frequency\": 60, \"uri\": \"http://example.com\", \"locations\": [ \"AWS_US_WEST_1\" ], \"status\": \"DISABLED\", \"slaThreshold\": 7, \"options\": {}, \"modifiedAt\": \"2016-09-26T23:12:46.981+0000\", \"createdAt\": \"2016-09-26T23:12:46.981+0000\", \"userId\": 0, \"apiVersion\": \"0.2.2\" } ], \"count\": 1 } Copy Query arguments: offset: The monitor count offset. Defaults to 0. For example, if you have 40 monitors and you use an offset value of 20, it will return monitors 21-40. limit: The number of results per page, maximum 100. Defaults to 50. You can include these in your cURL command as follows: curl -v \\ -H 'Api-Key:$API_KEY' $API_ENDPOINT/v3/monitors \\ -G -d 'offset=20&limit=100' Copy The headers include a Link to help you easily page your monitors. For example: <https://synthetics.newrelic.com/synthetics/api/v3/monitors/?offset=0&limit=20>; rel=\"first\", <https://synthetics.newrelic.com/synthetics/api/v3/monitors/?offset=40&limit=20>; rel=\"last\" Copy Get a specific monitor To view a single Synthetics monitor, send a GET request to $API_ENDPOINT/v3/monitors/$MONITOR_ID. curl -v \\ -H 'Api-Key:$API_KEY' $API_ENDPOINT/v3/monitors/$MONITOR_ID Copy A successful request will return a 200 OK response. The data returned will be a JSON object in the following format: { \"id\": UUID, \"name\": string, \"type\": string, \"frequency\": integer, \"uri\": string, \"locations\": array of strings, \"status\": string, \"slaThreshold\": double, \"userId\": integer, \"apiVersion\": string } Copy An invalid monitor ID will return 404 Not Found: The specified monitor doesn't exist. Create a monitor To add a new monitor to your Synthetics account, send a POST request to $API_ENDPOINT/v3/monitors with a JSON payload that describes the monitor. All fields in the following example are required unless stated otherwise: { \"name\": string [required], \"type\": string (SIMPLE, BROWSER, SCRIPT_API, SCRIPT_BROWSER) [required], \"frequency\": integer (minutes) [required, must be one of 1, 5, 10, 15, 30, 60, 360, 720, or 1440], \"uri\": string [required for SIMPLE and BROWSER type], \"locations\": array of strings [at least one required], \"status\": string (ENABLED, MUTED, DISABLED) [required], \"slaThreshold\": double, \"options\": { \"validationString\": string [only valid for SIMPLE and BROWSER types], \"verifySSL\": boolean (true, false) [only valid for SIMPLE and BROWSER types], \"bypassHEADRequest\": boolean (true, false) [only valid for SIMPLE types], \"treatRedirectAsFailure\": boolean (true, false) [only valid for SIMPLE types] } } Copy In addition, to add the script for a scripted monitor via the REST API, call an additional API endpoint to send the script for the monitor just created. If you are using private locations with verified script execution enabled, see script locations with verified script execution. Replace the Synthetics REST API attributes in the following example with your specific values: curl -v \\ -X POST -H 'Api-Key:$API_KEY' \\ -H 'Content-Type: application/json' $API_ENDPOINT/v3/monitors \\ -d '{ \"name\" : \"monitor1\", \"frequency\" : 15, \"uri\" : \"http://my-uri.com\", \"locations\" : [ \"AWS_US_WEST_1\" ], \"type\" : \"browser\", \"status\" : \"enabled\", \"slaThreshold\" : \"1.0\"}' Copy A successful request will return a 201 Created response, with the URI of the newly-created monitor specified in the location header. Possible error codes include: 400 Bad Request: One or more of the monitor values is invalid, or the format of the request is invalid. For example: the frequency is out of bounds or one or more of the specified locations is invalid. (See the error message in the body of the response.) 402 Payment Required: Creating the monitor will increase your scheduled checks past your account's purchased check limit. Update an existing monitor To update an existing monitor in New Relic, send a PUT request to $API_ENDPOINT/v3/monitors/$MONITOR_ID. In addition, for scripted monitors, follow the procedures to update the BASE64 encoded script. All fields are required. However, the TYPE of the monitor cannot be changed. Use a specific monitor ID, and replace the Synthetics REST API attributes with your specific values. curl -v \\ -X PUT -H 'Api-Key:$API_KEY' \\ -H 'Content-Type: application/json' $API_ENDPOINT/v3/monitors/$MONITOR_ID \\ -d '{ \"name\" : \"updated monitor name\", \"type\": \"monitor type\", \"frequency\" : 15, \"uri\" : \"http://my-uri.com/\", \"locations\" : [ \"AWS_US_WEST_1\" ], \"status\" : \"enabled\", \"slaThreshold\": \"7.0\" }' Copy PUT requests are intended to replace target entities, so all attributes required in the JSON payload when creating a new monitor are also required when updating an existing monitor. A successful request will return a 204 No Content response, with an empty body. Possible error codes include: 400 Bad Request: One or more of the monitor values is invalid, or the format of the request is invalid. For example, the frequency is out of bounds or one or more of the specified locations is invalid. (See the error message in the body of the response.) 404 Not Found: The specified monitor does not exist. Patch an existing monitor To patch an existing monitor in New Relic, send a PATCH request to $API_ENDPOINT/v3/monitors/$MONITOR_ID. Use a specific monitor ID, and replace the Synthetics REST API attributes with your specific values. curl -v \\ -X PATCH -H 'Api-Key:$API_KEY' \\ -H 'Content-Type: application/json' $API_ENDPOINT/v3/monitors/$MONITOR_ID \\ -d '{ \"name\" : \"updated monitor name\" }' Copy PATCH requests are intended to update individual attributes of your New Relic Synthetics monitor rather than updating the entire entity, so you may provide only the attributes you want to update. A successful request will return a 204 No Content response, with an empty body. Possible error codes include: 400 Bad Request: One or more of the monitor values is invalid, or the format of the request is invalid. For example, the frequency is out of bounds, or one or more of the specified locations is invalid. (See the error message in the body of the response.) 404 Not Found: The specified monitor does not exist. Delete an existing monitor To delete an existing monitor in New Relic Synthetics, send a DELETE request to $API_ENDPOINT/v3/monitors/$MONITOR_ID: curl -v \\ -H 'Api-Key:$API_KEY' \\ -X DELETE $API_ENDPOINT/v3/monitors/$MONITOR_ID Copy A successful request will return a 204 No Content response, with an empty body. An unsuccessful request will return the response 404 Not Found: The specified monitor does not exist. Get a list of valid locations To retrieve the list of valid locations in New Relic Synthetics, use the following command: curl -v \\ -X GET -H 'Api-Key:$API_KEY' $API_ENDPOINT/v1/locations Copy Script API for scripted browser and API test monitors In addition to the general API, there are several API methods for the scripted browsers (SCRIPT_BROWSER) and API test browsers (SCRIPT_API). These examples show cURL commands. Get monitor script To view the script associated with a specific SCRIPT_BROWSER or SCRIPT_API monitor in New Relic Synthetics for your account, send a GET request to $API_ENDPOINT/v3/monitors/$MONITOR_ID/script. For example: curl -v -H 'Api-Key: $API_KEY' $API_ENDPOINT/v3/monitors/$MONITOR_ID/script Copy A successful request will return a 200 OK response. The data returned will be a JSON object in the following format: { \"scriptText\": BASE64 encoded string } Copy Possible error codes include: 403 Forbidden: The specified monitor is not of type SCRIPT_BROWSER or SCRIPT_API. 404 Not Found: The specified monitor doesn't exist or the script associated with the monitor doesn't exist. Add scripted monitor To add a new scripted monitor to New Relic Synthetics with the REST API: Follow standard API procedures to add a new monitor, and identify the type as a SCRIPT_BROWSER or SCRIPT_API. Update the new monitor with a BASE64 encoded version of the script to the $MONITOR_UUID/script endpoint. For more information, refer to the example. If you are using private locations with verified script execution enabled, see script locations with verified script execution. Update monitor script To update the script associated with a specific SCRIPT_BROWSER or SCRIPT_API monitor in New Relic Synthetics for your account, send a PUT request to $API_ENDPOINT/v3/monitors/$MONITOR_ID/script with a JSON payload that contains the scriptText (required). scriptPayload='{\"scriptText\":BASE64 encoded string}' curl -v -X PUT \\ -H 'Api-Key:$API_KEY' \\ -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \\ $API_ENDPOINT/v3/monitors/$MONITOR_UUID/script \\ -d $scriptPayload Copy If you are using private locations with verified script execution enabled, see script locations with verified script execution. A successful request will return a 204 No Content response with an empty body. Possible error codes include: 400 Bad Request: Invalid BASE64 encoded string for scriptText or hmac. 403 Forbidden: The specified monitor is not of the type SCRIPT_BROWSER or SCRIPT_API. 404 Not Found: The specified monitor does not exist. Using private location scripts with verified script execution When creating or updating monitors for private locations that have verified script execution turned on, you must use scriptLocations to set the password: { \"scriptText\": BASE64 encoded String, \"scriptLocations\": [ { \"name\": Location name, \"hmac\" BASE64 encoded String of SHA256 HMAC for location } ] } Copy The password used to generate the HMAC string must match the password set for the private location. If you have multiple locations with Verified script execution enabled each location must have the HMAC calculated. When generating the HMAC string, use the SHA256 algorithm with the script and password. Here's an example for the script: var assert = require('assert'); assert.equal('1', '1'); Copy This example uses password as the password for the scriptLocation: curl -v -X PUT -H 'Api-Key: '$API_KEY' -H 'content-type: application/json' $API_ENDPOINT}/v3/monitors/$MONITOR_ID/script -d '{ \"scriptText\": \"dmFyIGFzc2VydCA9IHJlcXVpcmUoJ2Fzc2VydCcpOw0KYXNzZXJ0LmVxdWFsKCcxJywgJzEnKTs=\",\"scriptLocations\": [ { \"name\": \"my_vse_enabled_location\", \"hmac\": \"MjhiNGE4MjVlMDE1N2M4NDQ4MjNjNDFkZDEyYTRjMmUzZDE3NGJlNjU0MWFmOTJlMzNiODExOGU2ZjhkZTY4ZQ==\"} ]}' Copy Important You must remove the last newline character from both the script and the calculated HMAC value before encoding in BASE64. Calculation steps: Calculate the HMAC value from the script. One way is to use: cat script | openssl dgst -sha256 -hmac \"password\" > hmac Remove the newline character if one was added by openssl. Encode the HMAC in BASE64 without line breaks. Scripted browser example Here is an example of using New Relic's REST API and the bash script to create a scripted browser monitor. Scripted browser API example The following example shows cURL commands to create a scripted browser monitor. At the top of the script, replace the variables with your specific values. For the scriptfile variable, identify the filename for the script to be created. Here is a sample script that can be saved as sample_synth_script.js to use in the example: var assert = require(\"assert\"); $browser.get(\"http://example.com\").then(function(){ // Check the H1 title matches \"Example Domain\" return $browser.findElement($driver.By.css(\"h1\")).then(function(element){ return element.getText().then(function(text){ assert.equal(\"Example Domain\", text, \"Page H1 title did not match\"); }); }); }).then(function(){ // Check that the external link matches \"http://www.iana.org/domains/example\" return $browser.findElement($driver.By.css(\"div > p > a\")).then(function(element){ return element.getAttribute(\"href\").then(function(link){ assert.equal(\"http://www.iana.org/domains/example\", link, \"More information link did not match\"); }); }); }); Copy Bash script example This example shows the bash script that will create the SCRIPTED_BROWSER monitor. Tip In some cases you may want to use -w 0, which will disable line wrapping: base64 -w 0 $scriptfile #!/bin/bash # API key from your account settings API_KEY='' # Other attributes found at https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/apis/synthetics-rest-api/monitor-examples/attributes-synthetics-rest-api#api-attributes monitorName='Test API Script' monitorType='SCRIPT_BROWSER' frequency=1440 locations='\"AWS_US_WEST_1\", \"AWS_US_EAST_1\"' slaThreshold=7.0 # Location of the file with your script scriptfile=sample_synth_script.js # Test that the script file exists (does not validate content) if [ -e \"$scriptfile\" ] then script=$(cat \"$scriptfile\") payload=\"{ \\\"name\\\" : \\\"$monitorName\\\", \\\"frequency\\\" : $frequency, \\\"locations\\\" : [ $locations ], \\\"status\\\" : \\\"ENABLED\\\", \\\"type\\\" : \\\"$monitorType\\\", \\\"slaThreshold\\\" : $slaThreshold, \\\"uri\\\":\\\"\\\"}\" echo \"Creating monitor\" # Make cURL call to API and parse response headers to get monitor UUID shopt -s extglob # Required to trim whitespace; see below while IFS=':' read key value; do # trim whitespace in \"value\" value=${value##+([[:space:]])}; value=${value%%+([[:space:]])} case \"$key\" in location) LOCATION=\"$value\" ;; HTTP*) read PROTO STATUS MSG <<< \"$key{$value:+:$value}\" ;; esac done < <(curl -sS -i -X POST -H \"Api-Key:$API_KEY\" -H 'Content-Type:application/json' https://synthetics.newrelic.com/synthetics/api/v3/monitors -d \"$payload\") # Validate monitor creation & add script unless it failed if [ $STATUS = 201 ]; then echo \"Monitor created, $LOCATION \" echo \"Uploading script\" # base64 encode script encoded=`echo \"$script\" | base64` scriptPayload=\"{\\\"scriptText\\\":\\\"$encoded\\\"}\" curl -s -X PUT -H \"Api-Key:$API_KEY\" -H 'Content-Type:application/json' \"$LOCATION/script\" -d $scriptPayload echo \"Script uploaded\" else echo \"Monitor creation failed\" fi else echo \"script file not found, not creating monitor\" fi Copy",

Understand SLA report metrics Use SLA reports to view aggregated performance metrics for a single monitor, or for all your monitors from the account-wide SLA Reports page. SLA reports include the following metrics: Duration: The average duration across all monitor results. Uptime: The percentage of all monitor results that ended successfully. For example, Monitor A might check 50 times per day, and Monitor B might check 150 times per day. If Monitor A has 29 successes out of 50 and Monitor B has 148 successes out of 150, the Uptime would be 88.5: (29+148)/(50+150)=88.5 For individual SLA reports, the uptime score only includes the selected monitor. Apdex: The average Apdex across all monitors. Monitors have a default Apdex T of 7 seconds, but you can customize Apdex T for individual monitors by editing their settings. Apdex F, which defines a frustrating result, is always four times Apdex T. For more information about Apdex, see Apdex: Measuring user satisfaction. For individual SLA reports, the Apdex score only includes the selected monitor. % Satisfied: The percentage of monitor results which complete in a \"satisfying\" time. A satisfying time is defined as a monitor result that completes in Apdex T or less. % Toleration: The percentage of monitor results which complete in a \"tolerable\" time. A tolerable time is greater than Apdex T, but less than Apdex F (four times Apdex T). % Frustrated: The percentage of monitor results which complete in a \"frustrating\" time. A frustrating time is greater than Apdex F (four times Apdex T). The account-wide SLA report includes all monitor types (ping, simple browser, scripted browser, and API test).

      "body": "Read on to learn about synthetic monitoring's proxy settings and properties. Proxy settings API for scripted monitors Important You can set proxy server configuration for synthetic scripted monitors for monitor versions 0.4.0 or higher. The global object $network allows you to control the network configuration used by your synthetic scripted monitors. The following are applicable for both scripted browsers and API tests, unless otherwise stated. $network.setProxy(string or object PROXY URL) Sets a proxy server to be used for all per-URL requests (HTTP, HTTPS, and FTP). Additional notes: The port is optional. If not provided, it will be derived from the scheme. For example, for HTTP the port would be 80. The username and password are assumed to be the result of a call to encodeURIComponent(). Special characters like @ and : in the username and/or the password must be escaped. Returns This method returns a Promise that will resolve once the configuration has been applied. Parameters Parameter Data Type Description proxyURL | proxyUrlParsed String or Object The URL to connect to the proxy server. A string containing a proxyURL (for example, http://proxy_host:8888) or a plain object in the same format as defined by Node's url.parse(urlString) method. Examples An example of setting a proxy server with HTTP protocol on port 1234 with no authentication: $network.setProxy('http://host.com:1234') Copy An example of setting a proxy server with HTTP protocol with authentication credentials. $network.setProxy('http://proxyUsername:proxyPassword@proxyHost:1234') Copy $network.setProxyForHttp(string or object PROXY URL) Tip This call is exactly the same as the per-URL setProxy call, except that it applies to HTTP traffic. Sets a proxy server to be used for all HTTP requests. Additional notes: The port is optional. If not provided, it will be derived from the scheme. For example, for HTTP the port would be 80. The username and password are assumed to be the result of a call to encodeURIComponent(). Special characters like @ and : in the username and/or the password must be escaped. Returns This method returns a Promise that will resolve once the configuration has been applied. Parameters Parameter Data Type Description proxyURL | proxyUrlParsed String or Object The URL to connect to the proxy server. A string containing a proxyURL (for example, http://proxy_host:8888) or a plain object in the same format as defined by Node's url.parse(urlString) method. Examples An example of setting a proxy server with HTTP protocol on port 1234 with no authentication: $network.setProxyForHttp('http://host.com:1234') Copy An example of setting a proxy server with HTTP protocol with authentication credentials. $network.setProxyForHttp('http://proxyUsername:proxyPassword@proxyHost:1234') Copy $network.setProxyForHttps(string or object PROXY URL) Tip This call is exactly the same as the per-URL setProxy call, except that it applies to HTTPS traffic. Sets a proxy server to be used for all HTTPS requests. Additional notes: The port is optional. If not provided, it will be derived from the scheme. For example, for HTTP the default port would be 443. The username and password are assumed to be the result of a call to encodeURIComponent(). Special characters like @ and : in the username and/or the password must be escaped. Returns This method returns a Promise that will resolve once the configuration has been applied. Parameters Parameter Data Type Description proxyURL | proxyUrlParsed String or Object The URL to connect to the proxy server. A string containing a proxyURL (for example, http://proxy_host:8888) or a plain object in the same format as defined by Node's url.parse(urlString) method. Examples An example of setting a proxy server with HTTPS protocol on port 1234 with no authentication: $network.setProxyForHttps('https://host.com:1234') Copy An example of setting a proxy server with HTTPS protocol with authentication credentials. $network.setProxyForHttps('https://proxyUsername:proxyPassword@proxyHost:1234') Copy $network.setProxyPAC(string PAC SCRIPT URL, object AUTH OBJECT) Sets a proxy server via a proxy auto-config (PAC) script and returns a promise. This function is only available for scripted browser monitors. Returns This method returns a Promise that will resolve once the configuration has been applied. Parameters Parameter Data Type Description scriptURL String The URL of the PAC script. authCredentialsMap Object Map of authentication credentials to be provided to the proxy server(s), keyed by the hostnames of the proxy server. Values of this map must be defined in the format {username: 'authUsername', password: 'authPassword'} Examples An example of setting a proxy server via a proxy auto-config (PAC) script: var authCredentialsMap = { 'example.com': {username: 'authUsername', password: 'authPassword'}, } Copy $network.setProxyAdvanced(object PROXY RULES OBJECT) Tip This method is Chrome-specific: it only applies to scripted browser monitor types. It can be used to allow for a more flexible and complex proxy configuration. In most cases, this method will not be needed. Sets the proxy configuration using the format supported by Chrome Extension API for Proxying. The input is a ProxyRules object, as defined by the Chrome Extension API to configures proxies. You can add authCredentials for proxies that need it. See Parameters for more details. Returns This method returns a Promise that will resolve once the configuration has been applied. Parameters Parameter Data Type Description ProxyRules Object Object The proxyRulesObject is a plain object that follows the format ProxyRules as defined by the Chrome Extension API to configures proxies. This object is \"flavoured\" to fit our runtime: users can define an additional property, authCredentials, for the Proxy server objects to provide authentication credentials for a specific proxy server. authCredentials is an object in the format {username: 'authUsername', password: 'authPassword'}. Examples Here's an example of creating a proxyRules with authCredentials: var proxyRules = { singleProxy: { host:\"example.com\", authCredentials: { username: 'authUsername', password: 'authPassword' } } }; Copy Here's an example of setting up a proxied network with mixed network zone assets: var proxyRules = {singleProxy: {host:\"http://entproxy.mycompany.com\"}, bypassList:['s3.amazonaws.com','*.localcdn.com'] } $network.setProxyAdvanced(proxyRules) Copy $network.clearProxy() Clears/removes the current proxy configuration. Returns This method returns a Promise that will resolve once the configuration has been applied. $network.getProxy() This method returns the current proxy configuration. It must be synchronized in a promise callback. Examples An example of synchronizing getProxy with $network.setProxy(); and $network.clearProxy();: var assert = require('assert'); $network.setProxy(\"http://user:password@myproxyurl.com\") .then(function () { console.log('Proxy configuration applied'); //Note: $network.getProxy() is not synchronized with the webdriver Control Flow. //To make sure we get the proxy configuration after the call to setProxy() above // succeeds we need to use a promise callback var proxyData = $network.getProxy(); console.log(proxyData); }) .then(function () { // Again: getProxy() is not synchronized with the Webdriver Control Flow: we //need this promise callback otherwise clearProxy() might be called before the call // to getProxy() above returns return $network.clearProxy(); }) .then(function () { console.log('Proxy configuration cleared'); // We need this promise callback for reasons explained above var proxyData = $network.getProxy(); assert.equal(proxyData.rules, null); }); Copy Proxy properties Important This proxy information applies only to these versions: API monitors: 0.4.0, 0.2.2, 0.2.1, 0.1.0 Scripted monitors: 0.1.0 In order to analyze and collect your HTTP traffic metrics, New Relic must ensure the traffic passes through a conceptual funnel. Our synthetic monitoring includes a software funnel component capable of analyzing the HTTP requests or responses and then recording the information. New Relic's scripted browser monitors (versions 0.4.x and lower) include a mechanism to do this analysis without needing an HTTP proxy, so you don't have to configure anything. New Relic's API test (versions 0.4.x and lower) provides an $http object that is pre-configured to make the requests pass through the internal HTTP proxy. This allows you to write your test without including any proxy settings. If you want to use some other way to generate HTTP traffic while still collecting the HTTP traffic metrics, you can use $env.PROXY_HOST and $env.PROXY_PORT. To record traffic metrics, be sure to include these properties in your script.

You can also view SLA reports for individual monitors: Go to one.newrelic.com > Synthetics > (select a monitor) > SLA. one.newrelic.com > Synthetics > SLA Report: Use SLA reports to understand your monitors' performance over time. Understand SLA report metrics Use SLA reports to view aggregated performance metrics for a single monitor, or for all your monitors from the account-wide SLA Reports page. SLA reports include the following metrics: Duration: The average duration across all monitor results. Uptime: The percentage of all monitor results that ended successfully. For example, Monitor A might check 50 times per day, and Monitor B might check 150 times per day. If Monitor A has 29 successes out of 50 and Monitor B has 148 successes out of 150, the Uptime would be 88.5: (29+148)/(50+150)=88.5 For individual SLA reports, the uptime score only includes the selected monitor. Apdex: The average Apdex across all monitors. Monitors have a default Apdex T of 7 seconds, but you can customize Apdex T for individual monitors by editing their settings. Apdex F, which defines a frustrating result, is always four times Apdex T. For more information about Apdex, see Apdex: Measuring user satisfaction. For individual SLA reports, the Apdex score only includes the selected monitor. % Satisfied: The percentage of monitor results which complete in a \"satisfying\" time. A satisfying time is defined as a monitor result that completes in Apdex T or less. % Toleration: The percentage of monitor results which complete in a \"tolerable\" time. A tolerable time is greater than Apdex T, but less than Apdex F (four times Apdex T). % Frustrated: The percentage of monitor results which complete in a \"frustrating\" time. A frustrating time is greater than Apdex F (four times Apdex T). The account-wide SLA report includes all monitor types (ping, simple browser, scripted browser, and API test). Use page functions SLA reports support the following features: If you want to... Do this... View the report in Excel or an external program Select Download this report as .csv to download a copy of your SLA data. Open the file in Excel, Google Drive, or another spreadsheet editor to analyze your data. Change your Apdex targets The default Apdex T for all monitors is 7 seconds. You can customize your Apdex T target for individual monitors by editing your monitor. Change the time frame Choose from daily, weekly, or monthly aggregation by selecting the appropriate tab. Make the report public Change the Public SLA setting to ON to allow non-authenticated users to view the report. Select Share Report to get the public URL to share. Generate SLA values The values in the SLA report are generated from Insights queries against the available synthetic monitoring data. You can easily recreate these values and modify the queries to meet your needs. This query returns the average duration, the apdex, and the uptime. Substitute your values for the variables highlighted and described below. SELECT average(duration), apdex(duration, t:), percentage(count(*), WHERE result='SUCCESS') FROM SyntheticCheck FACET timeperiod Copy Variable Value t: Supply the Apdex T that you would like to calculate your apdex against. The duration attribute in the SyntheticCheck event is stored in milliseconds, so an Apdex T value of 7 seconds should be included as 7000. timeperiod This is the period that you would like to calculate on. For a daily report, facet on dateOf(timestamp), for a weekly report facet on weekOf(timestamp) and for a monthly report facet on monthOf(timestamp). NRQL queries default to querying against the last hour of data. In order to widen the scope of your data you will need to include a SINCE clause at the end of your query.

      "body": "Read on to learn about synthetic monitoring's proxy settings and properties. Proxy settings API for scripted monitors Important You can set proxy server configuration for synthetic scripted monitors for monitor versions 0.4.0 or higher. The global object $network allows you to control the network configuration used by your synthetic scripted monitors. The following are applicable for both scripted browsers and API tests, unless otherwise stated. $network.setProxy(string or object PROXY URL) Sets a proxy server to be used for all per-URL requests (HTTP, HTTPS, and FTP). Additional notes: The port is optional. If not provided, it will be derived from the scheme. For example, for HTTP the port would be 80. The username and password are assumed to be the result of a call to encodeURIComponent(). Special characters like @ and : in the username and/or the password must be escaped. Returns This method returns a Promise that will resolve once the configuration has been applied. Parameters Parameter Data Type Description proxyURL | proxyUrlParsed String or Object The URL to connect to the proxy server. A string containing a proxyURL (for example, http://proxy_host:8888) or a plain object in the same format as defined by Node's url.parse(urlString) method. Examples An example of setting a proxy server with HTTP protocol on port 1234 with no authentication: $network.setProxy('http://host.com:1234') Copy An example of setting a proxy server with HTTP protocol with authentication credentials. $network.setProxy('http://proxyUsername:proxyPassword@proxyHost:1234') Copy $network.setProxyForHttp(string or object PROXY URL) Tip This call is exactly the same as the per-URL setProxy call, except that it applies to HTTP traffic. Sets a proxy server to be used for all HTTP requests. Additional notes: The port is optional. If not provided, it will be derived from the scheme. For example, for HTTP the port would be 80. The username and password are assumed to be the result of a call to encodeURIComponent(). Special characters like @ and : in the username and/or the password must be escaped. Returns This method returns a Promise that will resolve once the configuration has been applied. Parameters Parameter Data Type Description proxyURL | proxyUrlParsed String or Object The URL to connect to the proxy server. A string containing a proxyURL (for example, http://proxy_host:8888) or a plain object in the same format as defined by Node's url.parse(urlString) method. Examples An example of setting a proxy server with HTTP protocol on port 1234 with no authentication: $network.setProxyForHttp('http://host.com:1234') Copy An example of setting a proxy server with HTTP protocol with authentication credentials. $network.setProxyForHttp('http://proxyUsername:proxyPassword@proxyHost:1234') Copy $network.setProxyForHttps(string or object PROXY URL) Tip This call is exactly the same as the per-URL setProxy call, except that it applies to HTTPS traffic. Sets a proxy server to be used for all HTTPS requests. Additional notes: The port is optional. If not provided, it will be derived from the scheme. For example, for HTTP the default port would be 443. The username and password are assumed to be the result of a call to encodeURIComponent(). Special characters like @ and : in the username and/or the password must be escaped. Returns This method returns a Promise that will resolve once the configuration has been applied. Parameters Parameter Data Type Description proxyURL | proxyUrlParsed String or Object The URL to connect to the proxy server. A string containing a proxyURL (for example, http://proxy_host:8888) or a plain object in the same format as defined by Node's url.parse(urlString) method. Examples An example of setting a proxy server with HTTPS protocol on port 1234 with no authentication: $network.setProxyForHttps('https://host.com:1234') Copy An example of setting a proxy server with HTTPS protocol with authentication credentials. $network.setProxyForHttps('https://proxyUsername:proxyPassword@proxyHost:1234') Copy $network.setProxyPAC(string PAC SCRIPT URL, object AUTH OBJECT) Sets a proxy server via a proxy auto-config (PAC) script and returns a promise. This function is only available for scripted browser monitors. Returns This method returns a Promise that will resolve once the configuration has been applied. Parameters Parameter Data Type Description scriptURL String The URL of the PAC script. authCredentialsMap Object Map of authentication credentials to be provided to the proxy server(s), keyed by the hostnames of the proxy server. Values of this map must be defined in the format {username: 'authUsername', password: 'authPassword'} Examples An example of setting a proxy server via a proxy auto-config (PAC) script: var authCredentialsMap = { 'example.com': {username: 'authUsername', password: 'authPassword'}, } Copy $network.setProxyAdvanced(object PROXY RULES OBJECT) Tip This method is Chrome-specific: it only applies to scripted browser monitor types. It can be used to allow for a more flexible and complex proxy configuration. In most cases, this method will not be needed. Sets the proxy configuration using the format supported by Chrome Extension API for Proxying. The input is a ProxyRules object, as defined by the Chrome Extension API to configures proxies. You can add authCredentials for proxies that need it. See Parameters for more details. Returns This method returns a Promise that will resolve once the configuration has been applied. Parameters Parameter Data Type Description ProxyRules Object Object The proxyRulesObject is a plain object that follows the format ProxyRules as defined by the Chrome Extension API to configures proxies. This object is \"flavoured\" to fit our runtime: users can define an additional property, authCredentials, for the Proxy server objects to provide authentication credentials for a specific proxy server. authCredentials is an object in the format {username: 'authUsername', password: 'authPassword'}. Examples Here's an example of creating a proxyRules with authCredentials: var proxyRules = { singleProxy: { host:\"example.com\", authCredentials: { username: 'authUsername', password: 'authPassword' } } }; Copy Here's an example of setting up a proxied network with mixed network zone assets: var proxyRules = {singleProxy: {host:\"http://entproxy.mycompany.com\"}, bypassList:['s3.amazonaws.com','*.localcdn.com'] } $network.setProxyAdvanced(proxyRules) Copy $network.clearProxy() Clears/removes the current proxy configuration. Returns This method returns a Promise that will resolve once the configuration has been applied. $network.getProxy() This method returns the current proxy configuration. It must be synchronized in a promise callback. Examples An example of synchronizing getProxy with $network.setProxy(); and $network.clearProxy();: var assert = require('assert'); $network.setProxy(\"http://user:password@myproxyurl.com\") .then(function () { console.log('Proxy configuration applied'); //Note: $network.getProxy() is not synchronized with the webdriver Control Flow. //To make sure we get the proxy configuration after the call to setProxy() above // succeeds we need to use a promise callback var proxyData = $network.getProxy(); console.log(proxyData); }) .then(function () { // Again: getProxy() is not synchronized with the Webdriver Control Flow: we //need this promise callback otherwise clearProxy() might be called before the call // to getProxy() above returns return $network.clearProxy(); }) .then(function () { console.log('Proxy configuration cleared'); // We need this promise callback for reasons explained above var proxyData = $network.getProxy(); assert.equal(proxyData.rules, null); }); Copy Proxy properties Important This proxy information applies only to these versions: API monitors: 0.4.0, 0.2.2, 0.2.1, 0.1.0 Scripted monitors: 0.1.0 In order to analyze and collect your HTTP traffic metrics, New Relic must ensure the traffic passes through a conceptual funnel. Our synthetic monitoring includes a software funnel component capable of analyzing the HTTP requests or responses and then recording the information. New Relic's scripted browser monitors (versions 0.4.x and lower) include a mechanism to do this analysis without needing an HTTP proxy, so you don't have to configure anything. New Relic's API test (versions 0.4.x and lower) provides an $http object that is pre-configured to make the requests pass through the internal HTTP proxy. This allows you to write your test without including any proxy settings. If you want to use some other way to generate HTTP traffic while still collecting the HTTP traffic metrics, you can use $env.PROXY_HOST and $env.PROXY_PORT. To record traffic metrics, be sure to include these properties in your script.

SLA reports include the following metrics: Duration: The average duration across all monitor results. Uptime: The percentage of all monitor results that ended successfully. For example, Monitor A might check 50 times per day, and Monitor B might check 150 times per day. If Monitor A has 29 successes out of 50 and Monitor B has 148 successes out of 150, the Uptime would be 88.5: (29+148)/(50+150)=88.5 For individual SLA reports, the uptime score only includes the selected monitor.

      "body": "Read on to learn about synthetic monitoring's proxy settings and properties. Proxy settings API for scripted monitors Important You can set proxy server configuration for synthetic scripted monitors for monitor versions 0.4.0 or higher. The global object $network allows you to control the network configuration used by your synthetic scripted monitors. The following are applicable for both scripted browsers and API tests, unless otherwise stated. $network.setProxy(string or object PROXY URL) Sets a proxy server to be used for all per-URL requests (HTTP, HTTPS, and FTP). Additional notes: The port is optional. If not provided, it will be derived from the scheme. For example, for HTTP the port would be 80. The username and password are assumed to be the result of a call to encodeURIComponent(). Special characters like @ and : in the username and/or the password must be escaped. Returns This method returns a Promise that will resolve once the configuration has been applied. Parameters Parameter Data Type Description proxyURL | proxyUrlParsed String or Object The URL to connect to the proxy server. A string containing a proxyURL (for example, http://proxy_host:8888) or a plain object in the same format as defined by Node's url.parse(urlString) method. Examples An example of setting a proxy server with HTTP protocol on port 1234 with no authentication: $network.setProxy('http://host.com:1234') Copy An example of setting a proxy server with HTTP protocol with authentication credentials. $network.setProxy('http://proxyUsername:proxyPassword@proxyHost:1234') Copy $network.setProxyForHttp(string or object PROXY URL) Tip This call is exactly the same as the per-URL setProxy call, except that it applies to HTTP traffic. Sets a proxy server to be used for all HTTP requests. Additional notes: The port is optional. If not provided, it will be derived from the scheme. For example, for HTTP the port would be 80. The username and password are assumed to be the result of a call to encodeURIComponent(). Special characters like @ and : in the username and/or the password must be escaped. Returns This method returns a Promise that will resolve once the configuration has been applied. Parameters Parameter Data Type Description proxyURL | proxyUrlParsed String or Object The URL to connect to the proxy server. A string containing a proxyURL (for example, http://proxy_host:8888) or a plain object in the same format as defined by Node's url.parse(urlString) method. Examples An example of setting a proxy server with HTTP protocol on port 1234 with no authentication: $network.setProxyForHttp('http://host.com:1234') Copy An example of setting a proxy server with HTTP protocol with authentication credentials. $network.setProxyForHttp('http://proxyUsername:proxyPassword@proxyHost:1234') Copy $network.setProxyForHttps(string or object PROXY URL) Tip This call is exactly the same as the per-URL setProxy call, except that it applies to HTTPS traffic. Sets a proxy server to be used for all HTTPS requests. Additional notes: The port is optional. If not provided, it will be derived from the scheme. For example, for HTTP the default port would be 443. The username and password are assumed to be the result of a call to encodeURIComponent(). Special characters like @ and : in the username and/or the password must be escaped. Returns This method returns a Promise that will resolve once the configuration has been applied. Parameters Parameter Data Type Description proxyURL | proxyUrlParsed String or Object The URL to connect to the proxy server. A string containing a proxyURL (for example, http://proxy_host:8888) or a plain object in the same format as defined by Node's url.parse(urlString) method. Examples An example of setting a proxy server with HTTPS protocol on port 1234 with no authentication: $network.setProxyForHttps('https://host.com:1234') Copy An example of setting a proxy server with HTTPS protocol with authentication credentials. $network.setProxyForHttps('https://proxyUsername:proxyPassword@proxyHost:1234') Copy $network.setProxyPAC(string PAC SCRIPT URL, object AUTH OBJECT) Sets a proxy server via a proxy auto-config (PAC) script and returns a promise. This function is only available for scripted browser monitors. Returns This method returns a Promise that will resolve once the configuration has been applied. Parameters Parameter Data Type Description scriptURL String The URL of the PAC script. authCredentialsMap Object Map of authentication credentials to be provided to the proxy server(s), keyed by the hostnames of the proxy server. Values of this map must be defined in the format {username: 'authUsername', password: 'authPassword'} Examples An example of setting a proxy server via a proxy auto-config (PAC) script: var authCredentialsMap = { 'example.com': {username: 'authUsername', password: 'authPassword'}, } Copy $network.setProxyAdvanced(object PROXY RULES OBJECT) Tip This method is Chrome-specific: it only applies to scripted browser monitor types. It can be used to allow for a more flexible and complex proxy configuration. In most cases, this method will not be needed. Sets the proxy configuration using the format supported by Chrome Extension API for Proxying. The input is a ProxyRules object, as defined by the Chrome Extension API to configures proxies. You can add authCredentials for proxies that need it. See Parameters for more details. Returns This method returns a Promise that will resolve once the configuration has been applied. Parameters Parameter Data Type Description ProxyRules Object Object The proxyRulesObject is a plain object that follows the format ProxyRules as defined by the Chrome Extension API to configures proxies. This object is \"flavoured\" to fit our runtime: users can define an additional property, authCredentials, for the Proxy server objects to provide authentication credentials for a specific proxy server. authCredentials is an object in the format {username: 'authUsername', password: 'authPassword'}. Examples Here's an example of creating a proxyRules with authCredentials: var proxyRules = { singleProxy: { host:\"example.com\", authCredentials: { username: 'authUsername', password: 'authPassword' } } }; Copy Here's an example of setting up a proxied network with mixed network zone assets: var proxyRules = {singleProxy: {host:\"http://entproxy.mycompany.com\"}, bypassList:['s3.amazonaws.com','*.localcdn.com'] } $network.setProxyAdvanced(proxyRules) Copy $network.clearProxy() Clears/removes the current proxy configuration. Returns This method returns a Promise that will resolve once the configuration has been applied. $network.getProxy() This method returns the current proxy configuration. It must be synchronized in a promise callback. Examples An example of synchronizing getProxy with $network.setProxy(); and $network.clearProxy();: var assert = require('assert'); $network.setProxy(\"http://user:password@myproxyurl.com\") .then(function () { console.log('Proxy configuration applied'); //Note: $network.getProxy() is not synchronized with the webdriver Control Flow. //To make sure we get the proxy configuration after the call to setProxy() above // succeeds we need to use a promise callback var proxyData = $network.getProxy(); console.log(proxyData); }) .then(function () { // Again: getProxy() is not synchronized with the Webdriver Control Flow: we //need this promise callback otherwise clearProxy() might be called before the call // to getProxy() above returns return $network.clearProxy(); }) .then(function () { console.log('Proxy configuration cleared'); // We need this promise callback for reasons explained above var proxyData = $network.getProxy(); assert.equal(proxyData.rules, null); }); Copy Proxy properties Important This proxy information applies only to these versions: API monitors: 0.4.0, 0.2.2, 0.2.1, 0.1.0 Scripted monitors: 0.1.0 In order to analyze and collect your HTTP traffic metrics, New Relic must ensure the traffic passes through a conceptual funnel. Our synthetic monitoring includes a software funnel component capable of analyzing the HTTP requests or responses and then recording the information. New Relic's scripted browser monitors (versions 0.4.x and lower) include a mechanism to do this analysis without needing an HTTP proxy, so you don't have to configure anything. New Relic's API test (versions 0.4.x and lower) provides an $http object that is pre-configured to make the requests pass through the internal HTTP proxy. This allows you to write your test without including any proxy settings. If you want to use some other way to generate HTTP traffic while still collecting the HTTP traffic metrics, you can use $env.PROXY_HOST and $env.PROXY_PORT. To record traffic metrics, be sure to include these properties in your script.

Proxy settings API for scripted monitors Important You can set proxy server configuration for synthetic scripted monitors for monitor versions 0.4.0 or higher. The global object $network allows you to control the network configuration used by your synthetic scripted monitors. The following are applicable for both scripted browsers and API tests, unless otherwise stated. $network.setProxy(string or object PROXY URL) Sets a proxy server to be used for all per-URL requests (HTTP, HTTPS, and FTP). Additional notes: The port is optional. If not provided, it will be derived from the scheme. For example, for HTTP the port would be 80. The username and password are assumed to be the result of a call to encodeURIComponent(). Special characters like @ and : in the username and/or the password must be escaped. Returns This method returns a Promise that will resolve once the configuration has been applied. Parameters Parameter Data Type Description proxyURL | proxyUrlParsed String or Object The URL to connect to the proxy server. A string containing a proxyURL (for example, http://proxy_host:8888) or a plain object in the same format as defined by Node's url.parse(urlString) method. Examples An example of setting a proxy server with HTTP protocol on port 1234 with no authentication: $network.setProxy('http://host.com:1234') Copy An example of setting a proxy server with HTTP protocol with authentication credentials. $network.setProxy('http://proxyUsername:proxyPassword@proxyHost:1234') Copy $network.setProxyForHttp(string or object PROXY URL) Tip This call is exactly the same as the per-URL setProxy call, except that it applies to HTTP traffic. Sets a proxy server to be used for all HTTP requests. Additional notes: The port is optional. If not provided, it will be derived from the scheme. For example, for HTTP the port would be 80. The username and password are assumed to be the result of a call to encodeURIComponent(). Special characters like @ and : in the username and/or the password must be escaped. Returns This method returns a Promise that will resolve once the configuration has been applied. Parameters Parameter Data Type Description proxyURL | proxyUrlParsed String or Object The URL to connect to the proxy server. A string containing a proxyURL (for example, http://proxy_host:8888) or a plain object in the same format as defined by Node's url.parse(urlString) method. Examples An example of setting a proxy server with HTTP protocol on port 1234 with no authentication: $network.setProxyForHttp('http://host.com:1234') Copy An example of setting a proxy server with HTTP protocol with authentication credentials. $network.setProxyForHttp('http://proxyUsername:proxyPassword@proxyHost:1234') Copy $network.setProxyForHttps(string or object PROXY URL) Tip This call is exactly the same as the per-URL setProxy call, except that it applies to HTTPS traffic. Sets a proxy server to be used for all HTTPS requests. Additional notes: The port is optional. If not provided, it will be derived from the scheme. For example, for HTTP the default port would be 443. The username and password are assumed to be the result of a call to encodeURIComponent(). Special characters like @ and : in the username and/or the password must be escaped. Returns This method returns a Promise that will resolve once the configuration has been applied. Parameters Parameter Data Type Description proxyURL | proxyUrlParsed String or Object The URL to connect to the proxy server. A string containing a proxyURL (for example, http://proxy_host:8888) or a plain object in the same format as defined by Node's url.parse(urlString) method. Examples An example of setting a proxy server with HTTPS protocol on port 1234 with no authentication: $network.setProxyForHttps('https://host.com:1234') Copy An example of setting a proxy server with HTTPS protocol with authentication credentials. $network.setProxyForHttps('https://proxyUsername:proxyPassword@proxyHost:1234') Copy $network.setProxyPAC(string PAC SCRIPT URL, object AUTH OBJECT) Sets a proxy server via a proxy auto-config (PAC) script and returns a promise. This function is only available for scripted browser monitors. Returns This method returns a Promise that will resolve once the configuration has been applied. Parameters Parameter Data Type Description scriptURL String The URL of the PAC script. authCredentialsMap Object Map of authentication credentials to be provided to the proxy server(s), keyed by the hostnames of the proxy server. Values of this map must be defined in the format {username: 'authUsername', password: 'authPassword'} Examples An example of setting a proxy server via a proxy auto-config (PAC) script: var authCredentialsMap = { 'example.com': {username: 'authUsername', password: 'authPassword'}, } Copy $network.setProxyAdvanced(object PROXY RULES OBJECT) Tip This method is Chrome-specific: it only applies to scripted browser monitor types. It can be used to allow for a more flexible and complex proxy configuration. In most cases, this method will not be needed. Sets the proxy configuration using the format supported by Chrome Extension API for Proxying. The input is a ProxyRules object, as defined by the Chrome Extension API to configures proxies. You can add authCredentials for proxies that need it. See Parameters for more details. Returns This method returns a Promise that will resolve once the configuration has been applied. Parameters Parameter Data Type Description ProxyRules Object Object The proxyRulesObject is a plain object that follows the format ProxyRules as defined by the Chrome Extension API to configures proxies. This object is \"flavoured\" to fit our runtime: users can define an additional property, authCredentials, for the Proxy server objects to provide authentication credentials for a specific proxy server. authCredentials is an object in the format {username: 'authUsername', password: 'authPassword'}. Examples Here's an example of creating a proxyRules with authCredentials: var proxyRules = { singleProxy: { host:\"example.com\", authCredentials: { username: 'authUsername', password: 'authPassword' } } }; Copy Here's an example of setting up a proxied network with mixed network zone assets: var proxyRules = {singleProxy: {host:\"http://entproxy.mycompany.com\"}, bypassList:['s3.amazonaws.com','*.localcdn.com'] } $network.setProxyAdvanced(proxyRules) Copy $network.clearProxy() Clears/removes the current proxy configuration. Returns This method returns a Promise that will resolve once the configuration has been applied. $network.getProxy() This method returns the current proxy configuration. It must be synchronized in a promise callback. Examples An example of synchronizing getProxy with $network.setProxy(); and $network.clearProxy();: var assert = require('assert'); $network.setProxy(\"http://user:password@myproxyurl.com\") .then(function () { console.log('Proxy configuration applied'); //Note: $network.getProxy() is not synchronized with the webdriver Control Flow. //To make sure we get the proxy configuration after the call to setProxy() above // succeeds we need to use a promise callback var proxyData = $network.getProxy(); console.log(proxyData); }) .then(function () { // Again: getProxy() is not synchronized with the Webdriver Control Flow: we //need this promise callback otherwise clearProxy() might be called before the call // to getProxy() above returns return $network.clearProxy(); }) .then(function () { console.log('Proxy configuration cleared'); // We need this promise callback for reasons explained above var proxyData = $network.getProxy(); assert.equal(proxyData.rules, null); }); Copy Proxy properties Important This proxy information applies only to these versions: API monitors: 0.4.0, 0.2.2, 0.2.1, 0.1.0 Scripted monitors: 0.1.0 In order to analyze and collect your HTTP traffic metrics, New Relic must ensure the traffic passes through a conceptual funnel. Our synthetic monitoring includes a software funnel component capable of analyzing the HTTP requests or responses and then recording the information. New Relic's scripted browser monitors (versions 0.4.x and lower) include a mechanism to do this analysis without needing an HTTP proxy, so you don't have to configure anything. New Relic's API test (versions 0.4.x and lower) provides an $http object that is pre-configured to make the requests pass through the internal HTTP proxy. This allows you to write your test without including any proxy settings. If you want to use some other way to generate HTTP traffic while still collecting the HTTP traffic metrics, you can use $env.PROXY_HOST and $env.PROXY_PORT. To record traffic metrics, be sure to include these properties in your script.

Understand SLA report metrics Use SLA reports to view aggregated performance metrics for a single monitor, or for all your monitors from the account-wide SLA Reports page. SLA reports include the following metrics: Duration: The average duration across all monitor results. Uptime: The percentage of all monitor results that ended successfully. For example, Monitor A might check 50 times per day, and Monitor B might check 150 times per day. If Monitor A has 29 successes out of 50 and Monitor B has 148 successes out of 150, the Uptime would be 88.5: (29+148)/(50+150)=88.5 For individual SLA reports, the uptime score only includes the selected monitor. Apdex: The average Apdex across all monitors. Monitors have a default Apdex T of 7 seconds, but you can customize Apdex T for individual monitors by editing their settings. Apdex F, which defines a frustrating result, is always four times Apdex T. For more information about Apdex, see Apdex: Measuring user satisfaction. For individual SLA reports, the Apdex score only includes the selected monitor. % Satisfied: The percentage of monitor results which complete in a \"satisfying\" time. A satisfying time is defined as a monitor result that completes in Apdex T or less. % Toleration: The percentage of monitor results which complete in a \"tolerable\" time. A tolerable time is greater than Apdex T, but less than Apdex F (four times Apdex T). % Frustrated: The percentage of monitor results which complete in a \"frustrating\" time. A frustrating time is greater than Apdex F (four times Apdex T). The account-wide SLA report includes all monitor types (ping, simple browser, scripted browser, and API test).

      "body": "Synthetic monitoring regularly checks your websites, critical business transactions, and API endpoints to measure optimal performance. Browser monitoring tracks the actual results of webpage performance across all variations of devices, browsers, and connection speeds. Used together, they provide a direct page load time comparison between real user (browser) interactions and the synthetic monitors. Compare performance and trends New Relic's comparative charting feature helps operations managers and teams by providing: Benchmarks for page load times Additional insights to help you plan where to optimize your site Comparisons of synthetic trends vs. actual browser performance without needing to switch between our monitoring capabilities. For example, during a page outage, you can compare synthetic monitoring trends to actual browser monitoring comparisons to see if an issue is also visible in Synthetics UI, or if it is caused by variables outside of New Relic. This helps you more efficiently know where to take action. What you need The comparative charting feature requires: Browser monitoring enabled with the browser SPA agent (version 885 or higher). A synthetic browser or scripted monitor with one or more tests on the same URLs monitored by the browser agent. After you enable the comparative charting feature either from synthetic or from browser monitoring, no additional setup is required. The comparative charting feature will appear when New Relic finds matching URLs. Enable comparison data After you enable the comparative charting feature from either synthetic or browser monitoring, no additional setup is required. The comparative charting feature will appear whenever synthetics or browser monitoring finds matching URLs. Enable comparative charting from Synthetics UI To enable the comparative charting feature from Synthetics UI: Go to one.newrelic.com > Synthetics > (select a monitor) > Summary. Above the selected monitor's Availability chart, select the ellipsis icon. Select Enable Synthetics comparison. Enable comparative charting from browser monitoring UI To enable the comparison data feature from browser monitoring: Go to one.newrelic.com > Browser > (select a browser app) > Page views. Select a page monitored by synthetic monitoring. From the selected page's Performance tab, select the ellipsis icon. Select Enable Synthetics comparison. View comparison data The comparative charting feature appears whenever synthetic monitoring identifies a URL match with browser monitoring and can compare it. You can compare browser and synthetic's performance either from the synthetic monitoring Summary page or from the browser monitoring Page views page (for browser apps or single page apps) without needing to switch between New Relic capabilities. Based on the selected data sources, the summary shows: Overall speed percentage comparison between browser (real user) page views and any matching URLs found in synthetic monitors that the user has permissions to view Number of URLs found in synthetic monitors that match the browser rollup URL To view the comparative charting summary: From synthetic monitoring UI: Go to one.newrelic.com > Synthetics > (select a monitor) > Summary. OR From browser monitoring UI: Go to one.newrelic.com > Browser > (select a browser app) > Page views, then select a page monitored by synthetic monitoring. Review the comparative charting feature's summary of overall speed percentage and number of matching URLs. To view additional details, select the summary's right arrow icon. Please note that in some cases the simple browser monitor ends before the browser agent has had a chance to collect the BrowserInteraction event. In this case, no comparative charting data is displayed in the UI. In order to resolve this issue, create a scripted browser monitor instead, and add a call to wait (sleep) after the page is loaded. Here is an example: $browser.get('https://www.mywebsite.com').then(function(){ return $browser.sleep(1000); }) Copy Hide or return comparison data To hide the comparative charting feature, select the ellipsis icon. To keep it visible but move it away from the top of the page, select Move to bottom. To return it to its original place on the page, select Move to top. To remove it from the page, select Hide all Synthetics/Browser comparisons. To return it to the page after removing it, follow standard procedures to enable comparison charting. Data sources New Relic uses these data sources for the synthetics and browser comparison in the UI. For deeper analysis of the comparative chart data you see in the UI, use the query builder to run NRQL queries. Variable Description Monitor account ID The account from which you are running the monitor: SELECT monitorAccountId FROM BrowserInteraction Copy Monitor ID The unique ID assigned to your synthetic monitor: SELECT monitorId FROM BrowserInteraction Copy Monitor job ID The ID of a single synthetics monitor run, which began at a specific time and originated from a specific location: SELECT monitorJobId FROM BrowserInteraction LIMIT 1 Copy Real user average The average page load time for real users viewing your website (excludes synthetic monitors).

Understand SLA report metrics Use SLA reports to view aggregated performance metrics for a single monitor, or for all your monitors from the account-wide SLA Reports page. SLA reports include the following metrics: Duration: The average duration across all monitor results. Uptime: The percentage of all monitor results that ended successfully. For example, Monitor A might check 50 times per day, and Monitor B might check 150 times per day. If Monitor A has 29 successes out of 50 and Monitor B has 148 successes out of 150, the Uptime would be 88.5: (29+148)/(50+150)=88.5 For individual SLA reports, the uptime score only includes the selected monitor. Apdex: The average Apdex across all monitors. Monitors have a default Apdex T of 7 seconds, but you can customize Apdex T for individual monitors by editing their settings. Apdex F, which defines a frustrating result, is always four times Apdex T. For more information about Apdex, see Apdex: Measuring user satisfaction. For individual SLA reports, the Apdex score only includes the selected monitor. % Satisfied: The percentage of monitor results which complete in a \"satisfying\" time. A satisfying time is defined as a monitor result that completes in Apdex T or less. % Toleration: The percentage of monitor results which complete in a \"tolerable\" time. A tolerable time is greater than Apdex T, but less than Apdex F (four times Apdex T). % Frustrated: The percentage of monitor results which complete in a \"frustrating\" time.

You can also view SLA reports for individual monitors: Go to one.newrelic.com > Synthetics > (select a monitor) > SLA. one.newrelic.com > Synthetics > SLA Report: Use SLA reports to understand your monitors' performance over time. Understand SLA report metrics Use SLA reports to view aggregated performance metrics for a single monitor, or for all your monitors from the account-wide SLA Reports page. SLA reports include the following metrics: Duration: The average duration across all monitor results. Uptime: The percentage of all monitor results that ended successfully. For example, Monitor A might check 50 times per day, and Monitor B might check 150 times per day. If Monitor A has 29 successes out of 50 and Monitor B has 148 successes out of 150, the Uptime would be 88.5: (29+148)/(50+150)=88.5 For individual SLA reports, the uptime score only includes the selected monitor. Apdex: The average Apdex across all monitors. Monitors have a default Apdex T of 7 seconds, but you can customize Apdex T for individual monitors by editing their settings. Apdex F, which defines a frustrating result, is always four times Apdex T. For more information about Apdex, see Apdex: Measuring user satisfaction. For individual SLA reports, the Apdex score only includes the selected monitor. % Satisfied: The percentage of monitor results which complete in a \"satisfying\" time. A satisfying time is defined as a monitor result that completes in Apdex T or less. % Toleration: The percentage of monitor results which complete in a \"tolerable\" time. A tolerable time is greater than Apdex T, but less than Apdex F (four times Apdex T). % Frustrated: The percentage of monitor results which complete in a \"frustrating\" time. A frustrating time is greater than Apdex F (four times Apdex T). The account-wide SLA report includes all monitor types (ping, simple browser, scripted browser, and API test).

View the report in Excel or an external program Select Download this report as .csv to download a copy of your SLA data. Open the file in Excel, Google Drive, or another spreadsheet editor to analyze your data. Change your Apdex targets The default Apdex T for all monitors is 7 seconds. You can customize your Apdex T target for individual monitors by editing your monitor. Change the time frame Choose from daily, weekly, or monthly aggregation by selecting the appropriate tab. Make the report public Change the Public SLA setting to ON to allow non-authenticated users to view the report. Select Share Report to get the public URL to share. Generate SLA values The values in the SLA report are generated from Insights queries against the available synthetic monitoring data. You can easily recreate these values and modify the queries to meet your needs. This query returns the average duration, the apdex, and the uptime. Substitute your values for the variables highlighted and described below. SELECT average(duration), apdex(duration, t:), percentage(count(*), WHERE result='SUCCESS') FROM SyntheticCheck FACET timeperiod Copy Variable Value t: Supply the Apdex T that you would like to calculate your apdex against. The duration attribute in the SyntheticCheck event is stored in milliseconds, so an Apdex T value of 7 seconds should be included as 7000. timeperiod This is the period that you would like to calculate on. For a daily report, facet on dateOf(timestamp), for a weekly report facet on weekOf(timestamp) and for a monthly report facet on monthOf(timestamp).

      "body": "Read on to learn about synthetic monitoring's proxy settings and properties. Proxy settings API for scripted monitors Important You can set proxy server configuration for synthetic scripted monitors for monitor versions 0.4.0 or higher. The global object $network allows you to control the network configuration used by your synthetic scripted monitors. The following are applicable for both scripted browsers and API tests, unless otherwise stated. $network.setProxy(string or object PROXY URL) Sets a proxy server to be used for all per-URL requests (HTTP, HTTPS, and FTP). Additional notes: The port is optional. If not provided, it will be derived from the scheme. For example, for HTTP the port would be 80. The username and password are assumed to be the result of a call to encodeURIComponent(). Special characters like @ and : in the username and/or the password must be escaped. Returns This method returns a Promise that will resolve once the configuration has been applied. Parameters Parameter Data Type Description proxyURL | proxyUrlParsed String or Object The URL to connect to the proxy server. A string containing a proxyURL (for example, http://proxy_host:8888) or a plain object in the same format as defined by Node's url.parse(urlString) method. Examples An example of setting a proxy server with HTTP protocol on port 1234 with no authentication: $network.setProxy('http://host.com:1234') Copy An example of setting a proxy server with HTTP protocol with authentication credentials. $network.setProxy('http://proxyUsername:proxyPassword@proxyHost:1234') Copy $network.setProxyForHttp(string or object PROXY URL) Tip This call is exactly the same as the per-URL setProxy call, except that it applies to HTTP traffic. Sets a proxy server to be used for all HTTP requests. Additional notes: The port is optional. If not provided, it will be derived from the scheme. For example, for HTTP the port would be 80. The username and password are assumed to be the result of a call to encodeURIComponent(). Special characters like @ and : in the username and/or the password must be escaped. Returns This method returns a Promise that will resolve once the configuration has been applied. Parameters Parameter Data Type Description proxyURL | proxyUrlParsed String or Object The URL to connect to the proxy server. A string containing a proxyURL (for example, http://proxy_host:8888) or a plain object in the same format as defined by Node's url.parse(urlString) method. Examples An example of setting a proxy server with HTTP protocol on port 1234 with no authentication: $network.setProxyForHttp('http://host.com:1234') Copy An example of setting a proxy server with HTTP protocol with authentication credentials. $network.setProxyForHttp('http://proxyUsername:proxyPassword@proxyHost:1234') Copy $network.setProxyForHttps(string or object PROXY URL) Tip This call is exactly the same as the per-URL setProxy call, except that it applies to HTTPS traffic. Sets a proxy server to be used for all HTTPS requests. Additional notes: The port is optional. If not provided, it will be derived from the scheme. For example, for HTTP the default port would be 443. The username and password are assumed to be the result of a call to encodeURIComponent(). Special characters like @ and : in the username and/or the password must be escaped. Returns This method returns a Promise that will resolve once the configuration has been applied. Parameters Parameter Data Type Description proxyURL | proxyUrlParsed String or Object The URL to connect to the proxy server. A string containing a proxyURL (for example, http://proxy_host:8888) or a plain object in the same format as defined by Node's url.parse(urlString) method. Examples An example of setting a proxy server with HTTPS protocol on port 1234 with no authentication: $network.setProxyForHttps('https://host.com:1234') Copy An example of setting a proxy server with HTTPS protocol with authentication credentials. $network.setProxyForHttps('https://proxyUsername:proxyPassword@proxyHost:1234') Copy $network.setProxyPAC(string PAC SCRIPT URL, object AUTH OBJECT) Sets a proxy server via a proxy auto-config (PAC) script and returns a promise. This function is only available for scripted browser monitors. Returns This method returns a Promise that will resolve once the configuration has been applied. Parameters Parameter Data Type Description scriptURL String The URL of the PAC script. authCredentialsMap Object Map of authentication credentials to be provided to the proxy server(s), keyed by the hostnames of the proxy server. Values of this map must be defined in the format {username: 'authUsername', password: 'authPassword'} Examples An example of setting a proxy server via a proxy auto-config (PAC) script: var authCredentialsMap = { 'example.com': {username: 'authUsername', password: 'authPassword'}, } Copy $network.setProxyAdvanced(object PROXY RULES OBJECT) Tip This method is Chrome-specific: it only applies to scripted browser monitor types. It can be used to allow for a more flexible and complex proxy configuration. In most cases, this method will not be needed. Sets the proxy configuration using the format supported by Chrome Extension API for Proxying. The input is a ProxyRules object, as defined by the Chrome Extension API to configures proxies. You can add authCredentials for proxies that need it. See Parameters for more details. Returns This method returns a Promise that will resolve once the configuration has been applied. Parameters Parameter Data Type Description ProxyRules Object Object The proxyRulesObject is a plain object that follows the format ProxyRules as defined by the Chrome Extension API to configures proxies. This object is \"flavoured\" to fit our runtime: users can define an additional property, authCredentials, for the Proxy server objects to provide authentication credentials for a specific proxy server. authCredentials is an object in the format {username: 'authUsername', password: 'authPassword'}. Examples Here's an example of creating a proxyRules with authCredentials: var proxyRules = { singleProxy: { host:\"example.com\", authCredentials: { username: 'authUsername', password: 'authPassword' } } }; Copy Here's an example of setting up a proxied network with mixed network zone assets: var proxyRules = {singleProxy: {host:\"http://entproxy.mycompany.com\"}, bypassList:['s3.amazonaws.com','*.localcdn.com'] } $network.setProxyAdvanced(proxyRules) Copy $network.clearProxy() Clears/removes the current proxy configuration. Returns This method returns a Promise that will resolve once the configuration has been applied. $network.getProxy() This method returns the current proxy configuration. It must be synchronized in a promise callback. Examples An example of synchronizing getProxy with $network.setProxy(); and $network.clearProxy();: var assert = require('assert'); $network.setProxy(\"http://user:password@myproxyurl.com\") .then(function () { console.log('Proxy configuration applied'); //Note: $network.getProxy() is not synchronized with the webdriver Control Flow. //To make sure we get the proxy configuration after the call to setProxy() above // succeeds we need to use a promise callback var proxyData = $network.getProxy(); console.log(proxyData); }) .then(function () { // Again: getProxy() is not synchronized with the Webdriver Control Flow: we //need this promise callback otherwise clearProxy() might be called before the call // to getProxy() above returns return $network.clearProxy(); }) .then(function () { console.log('Proxy configuration cleared'); // We need this promise callback for reasons explained above var proxyData = $network.getProxy(); assert.equal(proxyData.rules, null); }); Copy Proxy properties Important This proxy information applies only to these versions: API monitors: 0.4.0, 0.2.2, 0.2.1, 0.1.0 Scripted monitors: 0.1.0 In order to analyze and collect your HTTP traffic metrics, New Relic must ensure the traffic passes through a conceptual funnel. Our synthetic monitoring includes a software funnel component capable of analyzing the HTTP requests or responses and then recording the information. New Relic's scripted browser monitors (versions 0.4.x and lower) include a mechanism to do this analysis without needing an HTTP proxy, so you don't have to configure anything. New Relic's API test (versions 0.4.x and lower) provides an $http object that is pre-configured to make the requests pass through the internal HTTP proxy. This allows you to write your test without including any proxy settings. If you want to use some other way to generate HTTP traffic while still collecting the HTTP traffic metrics, you can use $env.PROXY_HOST and $env.PROXY_PORT. To record traffic metrics, be sure to include these properties in your script.

      "body": "New Relic's synthetic monitoring uses monitors distributed throughout data centers around the world. By design, it captures what is essentially performance data for simulated traffic. It does not capture or handle any personal data by default. All data handled by synthetic monitors is expected to be non-personal. This document provides additional details about what we do to ensure data privacy and security with synthetic monitoring, plus additional options you can use. For more information about New Relic's security measures, see our security and privacy documentation, or visit the New Relic security website. What we do Here's a summary of the data privacy and security measures that New Relic provides for you. Data privacy and security Comments No personal data By definition, all data collected through synthetic monitoring is test data created for the purpose of monitoring. None of this data includes personal data from any individual. TLS TLS encryption is required for all domains. This applies to public locations and private locations. Authentication Synthetic monitoring supports a variety of authentication mechanisms, including Basic, Digest, NTLM, and NTLMv2. Available options depend on the type of monitor you choose. Data collection The data transferred to the synthetic endpoint includes: Monitor run results, including full request and response headers of all requests, a complete HAR file of the session, and any screenshots captured (on failure or manually) Polling for available jobs in the private location's queue Private minion \"heartbeat\" every 30 seconds The SyntheticsPrivateMinion event contains basic minion status, including job success and failure counts, queue size, minion version, etc. Data received Data received from the synthetic monitoring endpoint contains the scheduled check's details. This includes the information necessary to complete the check for the minion: Target URL Validation text Full script (for synthetic scripted browser monitors) Data storage location Data collected by synthetic monitoring is stored in the region selected by each customer for their account (US or EU). Monitor configuration details (including frequency, check locations, target URL, and the full script for any scripted browser or API test monitors) are stored on our end. We also store all monitor check results for each monitor type. Data storage by monitor type For ping monitors, data storage includes the HAR file, which includes all requests and responses made during the check. For simple browsers, scripted browsers, and API tests, data storage includes the following: The HAR file includes full request and response headers for all requests made during the check. Any screenshots taken during the check are automatically included for simple and scripted browser monitors only on failure. However, you can manually configure this with scripting. The browser log (JS console) is automatically included for simple and scripted browsers. Any script output is included for scripted browsers and API test monitors. Response bodies New Relic never stores response bodies from requests originated by synthetic monitoring, unless you have manually configured a monitor script to do so. IP addresses Synthetic public minions are expected to be activated using non-personal credentials. Their IP addresses are not defined as personal data under data protection and privacy laws. What you can do For additional levels of security and data privacy, consider using these options. Additional measures Comments User access To control which of your users can access your monitors and private locations, set up role-based synthetic monitoring permissions and user groups. In addition, to track and be notified about changes, use audit logs and alert notifications. Passwords, API keys, user names, etc. To securely store sensitive information, use secured credentials for scripted browsers and API tests. The credentials are securely stored using AES-GCM 256-bit encryption at rest with keys managed by Amazon AWS Key Management Service (KMS). Sites behind firewalls To control what sites you want to monitor behind your firewall, you can: Add the synthetic public minion IP addresses to your allow list or deny list. Use private locations to monitor sites or endpoints. This can provide an extra layer of security when monitoring your internally hosted sites and services. Web pages behind login pages If you configure synthetic monitoring to track website areas that are located behind a login page, be sure to create a non-personal login specifically for this purpose. This unique login will reduce the risk of unintended personal data exposure. Proxy configuration Aside from the target URLs monitored by New Relic, private minions will regularly send data to and receive from the synthetic monitoring endpoint. To configure a proxy for all traffic to and from this endpoint, set the MINION_API_PROXY environment variable on the minion host. Private minions security To ensure that only the scripts you intend to run are allowed to run on private minions, use verified script execution.",

You can also view SLA reports for individual monitors: Go to one.newrelic.com > Synthetics > (select a monitor) > SLA. one.newrelic.com > Synthetics > SLA Report: Use SLA reports to understand your monitors' performance over time. Understand SLA report metrics Use SLA reports to view aggregated performance metrics for a single monitor, or for all your monitors from the account-wide SLA Reports page. SLA reports include the following metrics: Duration: The average duration across all monitor results. Uptime: The percentage of all monitor results that ended successfully. For example, Monitor A might check 50 times per day, and Monitor B might check 150 times per day. If Monitor A has 29 successes out of 50 and Monitor B has 148 successes out of 150, the Uptime would be 88.5: (29+148)/(50+150)=88.5 For individual SLA reports, the uptime score only includes the selected monitor. Apdex: The average Apdex across all monitors. Monitors have a default Apdex T of 7 seconds, but you can customize Apdex T for individual monitors by editing their settings. Apdex F, which defines a frustrating result, is always four times Apdex T. For more information about Apdex, see Apdex: Measuring user satisfaction. For individual SLA reports, the Apdex score only includes the selected monitor. % Satisfied: The percentage of monitor results which complete in a \"satisfying\" time. A satisfying time is defined as a monitor result that completes in Apdex T or less. % Toleration: The percentage of monitor results which complete in a \"tolerable\" time. A tolerable time is greater than Apdex T, but less than Apdex F (four times Apdex T). % Frustrated: The percentage of monitor results which complete in a \"frustrating\" time. A frustrating time is greater than Apdex F (four times Apdex T). The account-wide SLA report includes all monitor types (ping, simple browser, scripted browser, and API test).

View the report in Excel or an external program Select Download this report as .csv to download a copy of your SLA data. Open the file in Excel, Google Drive, or another spreadsheet editor to analyze your data. Change your Apdex targets The default Apdex T for all monitors is 7 seconds. You can customize your Apdex T target for individual monitors by editing your monitor. Change the time frame Choose from daily, weekly, or monthly aggregation by selecting the appropriate tab. Make the report public Change the Public SLA setting to ON to allow non-authenticated users to view the report. Select Share Report to get the public URL to share. Generate SLA values The values in the SLA report are generated from Insights queries against the available synthetic monitoring data. You can easily recreate these values and modify the queries to meet your needs. This query returns the average duration, the apdex, and the uptime. Substitute your values for the variables highlighted and described below. SELECT average(duration), apdex(duration, t:), percentage(count(*), WHERE result='SUCCESS') FROM SyntheticCheck FACET timeperiod Copy Variable Value t: Supply the Apdex T that you would like to calculate your apdex against. The duration attribute in the SyntheticCheck event is stored in milliseconds, so an Apdex T value of 7 seconds should be included as 7000. timeperiod This is the period that you would like to calculate on. For a daily report, facet on dateOf(timestamp), for a weekly report facet on weekOf(timestamp) and for a monthly report facet on monthOf(timestamp). NRQL queries default to querying against the last hour of data. In order to widen the scope of your data you will need to include a SINCE clause at the end of your query. Example #1: Daily report for the last week To generate a daily report for the last week you would add SINCE 1 week ago: SELECT average(duration), apdex(duration, t:), percentage(count(*), WHERE result='SUCCESS') FROM SyntheticCheck FACET dateOf(timestamp) SINCE 1 week ago Copy Example #2: Report for a particular monitor To scope the results to a particular monitor you can edit the above query to include a specific monitor name: SELECT average(duration), apdex(duration, t:), percentage(count(*), WHERE result='SUCCESS') FROM SyntheticCheck FACET timeperiod WHERE monitorName = 'mymonitorname' Copy Example #3: Report for multiple monitors To scope the results to a collection of monitors: SELECT average(duration), apdex(duration, t:), percentage(count(*), WHERE result='SUCCESS') FROM SyntheticCheck FACET timeperiod WHERE monitorName IN ('mymonitor1', 'mymonitor2', 'mymonitor3') Copy For more help Additional documentation resources include: Access your monitors (view your list of monitors, and view current summary statistics for each monitor) Add and edit monitors (edit your monitor settings to customize Apdex targets for individual monitors) APM SLA reports (SLA reporting for your APM application)",

      "body": "Read on to learn about synthetic monitoring's proxy settings and properties. Proxy settings API for scripted monitors Important You can set proxy server configuration for synthetic scripted monitors for monitor versions 0.4.0 or higher. The global object $network allows you to control the network configuration used by your synthetic scripted monitors. The following are applicable for both scripted browsers and API tests, unless otherwise stated. $network.setProxy(string or object PROXY URL) Sets a proxy server to be used for all per-URL requests (HTTP, HTTPS, and FTP). Additional notes: The port is optional. If not provided, it will be derived from the scheme. For example, for HTTP the port would be 80. The username and password are assumed to be the result of a call to encodeURIComponent(). Special characters like @ and : in the username and/or the password must be escaped. Returns This method returns a Promise that will resolve once the configuration has been applied. Parameters Parameter Data Type Description proxyURL | proxyUrlParsed String or Object The URL to connect to the proxy server. A string containing a proxyURL (for example, http://proxy_host:8888) or a plain object in the same format as defined by Node's url.parse(urlString) method. Examples An example of setting a proxy server with HTTP protocol on port 1234 with no authentication: $network.setProxy('http://host.com:1234') Copy An example of setting a proxy server with HTTP protocol with authentication credentials. $network.setProxy('http://proxyUsername:proxyPassword@proxyHost:1234') Copy $network.setProxyForHttp(string or object PROXY URL) Tip This call is exactly the same as the per-URL setProxy call, except that it applies to HTTP traffic. Sets a proxy server to be used for all HTTP requests. Additional notes: The port is optional. If not provided, it will be derived from the scheme. For example, for HTTP the port would be 80. The username and password are assumed to be the result of a call to encodeURIComponent(). Special characters like @ and : in the username and/or the password must be escaped. Returns This method returns a Promise that will resolve once the configuration has been applied. Parameters Parameter Data Type Description proxyURL | proxyUrlParsed String or Object The URL to connect to the proxy server. A string containing a proxyURL (for example, http://proxy_host:8888) or a plain object in the same format as defined by Node's url.parse(urlString) method. Examples An example of setting a proxy server with HTTP protocol on port 1234 with no authentication: $network.setProxyForHttp('http://host.com:1234') Copy An example of setting a proxy server with HTTP protocol with authentication credentials. $network.setProxyForHttp('http://proxyUsername:proxyPassword@proxyHost:1234') Copy $network.setProxyForHttps(string or object PROXY URL) Tip This call is exactly the same as the per-URL setProxy call, except that it applies to HTTPS traffic. Sets a proxy server to be used for all HTTPS requests. Additional notes: The port is optional. If not provided, it will be derived from the scheme. For example, for HTTP the default port would be 443. The username and password are assumed to be the result of a call to encodeURIComponent(). Special characters like @ and : in the username and/or the password must be escaped. Returns This method returns a Promise that will resolve once the configuration has been applied. Parameters Parameter Data Type Description proxyURL | proxyUrlParsed String or Object The URL to connect to the proxy server. A string containing a proxyURL (for example, http://proxy_host:8888) or a plain object in the same format as defined by Node's url.parse(urlString) method. Examples An example of setting a proxy server with HTTPS protocol on port 1234 with no authentication: $network.setProxyForHttps('https://host.com:1234') Copy An example of setting a proxy server with HTTPS protocol with authentication credentials. $network.setProxyForHttps('https://proxyUsername:proxyPassword@proxyHost:1234') Copy $network.setProxyPAC(string PAC SCRIPT URL, object AUTH OBJECT) Sets a proxy server via a proxy auto-config (PAC) script and returns a promise. This function is only available for scripted browser monitors. Returns This method returns a Promise that will resolve once the configuration has been applied. Parameters Parameter Data Type Description scriptURL String The URL of the PAC script. authCredentialsMap Object Map of authentication credentials to be provided to the proxy server(s), keyed by the hostnames of the proxy server. Values of this map must be defined in the format {username: 'authUsername', password: 'authPassword'} Examples An example of setting a proxy server via a proxy auto-config (PAC) script: var authCredentialsMap = { 'example.com': {username: 'authUsername', password: 'authPassword'}, } Copy $network.setProxyAdvanced(object PROXY RULES OBJECT) Tip This method is Chrome-specific: it only applies to scripted browser monitor types. It can be used to allow for a more flexible and complex proxy configuration. In most cases, this method will not be needed. Sets the proxy configuration using the format supported by Chrome Extension API for Proxying. The input is a ProxyRules object, as defined by the Chrome Extension API to configures proxies. You can add authCredentials for proxies that need it. See Parameters for more details. Returns This method returns a Promise that will resolve once the configuration has been applied. Parameters Parameter Data Type Description ProxyRules Object Object The proxyRulesObject is a plain object that follows the format ProxyRules as defined by the Chrome Extension API to configures proxies. This object is \"flavoured\" to fit our runtime: users can define an additional property, authCredentials, for the Proxy server objects to provide authentication credentials for a specific proxy server. authCredentials is an object in the format {username: 'authUsername', password: 'authPassword'}. Examples Here's an example of creating a proxyRules with authCredentials: var proxyRules = { singleProxy: { host:\"example.com\", authCredentials: { username: 'authUsername', password: 'authPassword' } } }; Copy Here's an example of setting up a proxied network with mixed network zone assets: var proxyRules = {singleProxy: {host:\"http://entproxy.mycompany.com\"}, bypassList:['s3.amazonaws.com','*.localcdn.com'] } $network.setProxyAdvanced(proxyRules) Copy $network.clearProxy() Clears/removes the current proxy configuration. Returns This method returns a Promise that will resolve once the configuration has been applied. $network.getProxy() This method returns the current proxy configuration. It must be synchronized in a promise callback. Examples An example of synchronizing getProxy with $network.setProxy(); and $network.clearProxy();: var assert = require('assert'); $network.setProxy(\"http://user:password@myproxyurl.com\") .then(function () { console.log('Proxy configuration applied'); //Note: $network.getProxy() is not synchronized with the webdriver Control Flow. //To make sure we get the proxy configuration after the call to setProxy() above // succeeds we need to use a promise callback var proxyData = $network.getProxy(); console.log(proxyData); }) .then(function () { // Again: getProxy() is not synchronized with the Webdriver Control Flow: we //need this promise callback otherwise clearProxy() might be called before the call // to getProxy() above returns return $network.clearProxy(); }) .then(function () { console.log('Proxy configuration cleared'); // We need this promise callback for reasons explained above var proxyData = $network.getProxy(); assert.equal(proxyData.rules, null); }); Copy Proxy properties Important This proxy information applies only to these versions: API monitors: 0.4.0, 0.2.2, 0.2.1, 0.1.0 Scripted monitors: 0.1.0 In order to analyze and collect your HTTP traffic metrics, New Relic must ensure the traffic passes through a conceptual funnel. Our synthetic monitoring includes a software funnel component capable of analyzing the HTTP requests or responses and then recording the information. New Relic's scripted browser monitors (versions 0.4.x and lower) include a mechanism to do this analysis without needing an HTTP proxy, so you don't have to configure anything. New Relic's API test (versions 0.4.x and lower) provides an $http object that is pre-configured to make the requests pass through the internal HTTP proxy. This allows you to write your test without including any proxy settings. If you want to use some other way to generate HTTP traffic while still collecting the HTTP traffic metrics, you can use $env.PROXY_HOST and $env.PROXY_PORT. To record traffic metrics, be sure to include these properties in your script.

      "body": "Synthetic monitoring is a suite of automated, scriptable tools to monitor your websites, critical business transactions, and API endpoints. You can simulate user traffic to proactively detect and resolve outages and poor performance of critical endpoints before your customers notice. Why it matters With synthetic monitoring, you can: Get the context of failures by connecting the availability and performance of endpoints to the underlying applications and infrastructure. Easily diagnose if an issue stems from the network or AWS location, a slow third party resource, or the health of backend services or infrastructure. Add synthetic monitoring into build automation and CI/CD pipelines to automatically track performance and check functionality for each deployment. Expand your monitoring further with real, Selenium-powered scripted browsers, which test login procedures, searches, and other critical business transactions. Monitor your API endpoints with API tests Advanced testing Synthetic monitoring allows you to proactively monitor your website or API endpoint to ensure your content is not only available, but fully functional. Synthetic monitoring browser tests send real, Selenium-powered Google Chrome browsers to your site from locations around the world to ensure your content is always up, everywhere. Scripted browsers expand your testing capabilities, so you can test uncommon user flows or beta-test complex procedures. For example, ensure your users are able to sign up for your newsletter, add an item to their cart, or search for and find a piece of critical content with a simple JavaScript-like language. Test your backend with API monitors, which allow you to run scripted tests against any API endpoint. Enhanced monitoring and reporting Synthetic monitoring aggregates the results of each check into metrics, allowing you to see patterns and identify causes of poor performance. Synthetic monitoring also stores each and every monitor result, so you can see exactly where your website broke down. Alerts notify you if your website or API endpoint is inaccessible. You can even expand your geographical coverage or monitor internal websites by creating private locations. You can also query your monitor results for a closer look. New Relic retains monitor results for thirteen months, ensuring you can compare usage year over year. Additional features Synthetic monitoring includes the following features: Feature Description Real browsers With simple browser and scripted browser monitors, synthetic monitoring doesn't simply check that your host is up. It loads the actual page content in a real, fully virtualized Google Chrome browser (powered by Selenium) to provide testing that mirrors your users' actions. Detailed results view Synthetic monitoring stores every single run of your monitor for 13 months, so you can view a detailed breakdown of each and every check. You can get a snapshot of your website's performance and availability, or hunt down specific problems. Comparative charts with browser monitoring Use New Relic's comparative charting feature for a direct page load time comparison between real user (browser monitoring) interactions and the synthetic monitors. For example, during a page outage, you can compare trends to see if an issue is also visible in synthetic monitoring, or if it is caused by other variables. Advanced scripted monitoring Use scripted browsers to run complex test cases against your website. Ensure critical processes like checkout and login are always running smoothly, and build a baseline to compare against when things go wrong. With a built-in scripting IDE based on Node.js, create scripts quickly without leaving your browser. Global test coverage Check coverage from locations around the world to ensure your users can access your website from anywhere, anytime. Monitor sites behind your firewall by adding the synthetic monitoring static IP addresses to your allow list. Use private locations to monitor internal sites or to expand your coverage to new locations. Compatibility with popular analytics platforms Synthetic monitoring specifically excludes scripts for popular analytics services, like Google Analytics. This ensures your analytics tools continue to receive the exact same data, even with thousands of monitors checking your website each month. You can unblock any of the services blocked by default, or block additional services. REST API functions Synthetic monitoring includes a REST API, which you can use to manage: Simple monitors and scripted monitors Categories and labels for monitors Alert notifications Data protection and privacy The data from synthetic monitoring is test data, representing typical interaction with the webpage or application. It is never actual data from human beings. The data collected when you use synthetic monitoring therefore is not personal data. For more information, see the Synthetic monitoring security documentation. Compatibility and requirements Synthetic monitoring does not require any software except a supported browser. Important To monitor a site behind your firewall, add the synthetic monitoring public minion IP addresses to your allow list. Permissions By default, all users in your account can: View synthetic monitoring pages. Add, edit, and delete monitors. For more fine-grained control, you can enable the optional permissions system. The permissions system allows you to manage the level of access for users to view and edit within synthetic monitoring (for example, monitors and private locations).",

Understand SLA report metrics Use SLA reports to view aggregated performance metrics for a single monitor, or for all your monitors from the account-wide SLA Reports page. SLA reports include the following metrics: Duration: The average duration across all monitor results. Uptime: The percentage of all monitor results that ended successfully. For example, Monitor A might check 50 times per day, and Monitor B might check 150 times per day. If Monitor A has 29 successes out of 50 and Monitor B has 148 successes out of 150, the Uptime would be 88.5: (29+148)/(50+150)=88.5 For individual SLA reports, the uptime score only includes the selected monitor. Apdex: The average Apdex across all monitors. Monitors have a default Apdex T of 7 seconds, but you can customize Apdex T for individual monitors by editing their settings. Apdex F, which defines a frustrating result, is always four times Apdex T. For more information about Apdex, see Apdex: Measuring user satisfaction. For individual SLA reports, the Apdex score only includes the selected monitor. % Satisfied: The percentage of monitor results which complete in a \"satisfying\" time. A satisfying time is defined as a monitor result that completes in Apdex T or less. % Toleration: The percentage of monitor results which complete in a \"tolerable\" time. A tolerable time is greater than Apdex T, but less than Apdex F (four times Apdex T). % Frustrated: The percentage of monitor results which complete in a \"frustrating\" time. A frustrating time is greater than Apdex F (four times Apdex T). The account-wide SLA report includes all monitor types (ping, simple browser, scripted browser, and API test). Use page functions SLA reports support the following features: If you want to... Do this... View the report in Excel or an external program Select Download this report as .csv to download a copy of your SLA data. Open the file in Excel, Google Drive, or another spreadsheet editor to analyze your data. Change your Apdex targets The default Apdex T for all monitors is 7 seconds. You can customize your Apdex T target for individual monitors by editing your monitor. Change the time frame Choose from daily, weekly, or monthly aggregation by selecting the appropriate tab. Make the report public Change the Public SLA setting to ON to allow non-authenticated users to view the report. Select Share Report to get the public URL to share. Generate SLA values The values in the SLA report are generated from Insights queries against the available synthetic monitoring data. You can easily recreate these values and modify the queries to meet your needs. This query returns the average duration, the apdex, and the uptime. Substitute your values for the variables highlighted and described below. SELECT average(duration), apdex(duration, t:), percentage(count(*), WHERE result='SUCCESS') FROM SyntheticCheck FACET timeperiod Copy Variable Value t: Supply the Apdex T that you would like to calculate your apdex against. The duration attribute in the SyntheticCheck event is stored in milliseconds, so an Apdex T value of 7 seconds should be included as 7000. timeperiod This is the period that you would like to calculate on. For a daily report, facet on dateOf(timestamp), for a weekly report facet on weekOf(timestamp) and for a monthly report facet on monthOf(timestamp). NRQL queries default to querying against the last hour of data. In order to widen the scope of your data you will need to include a SINCE clause at the end of your query. Example #1: Daily report for the last week To generate a daily report for the last week you would add SINCE 1 week ago: SELECT average(duration), apdex(duration, t:), percentage(count(*), WHERE result='SUCCESS') FROM SyntheticCheck FACET dateOf(timestamp) SINCE 1 week ago Copy Example #2: Report for a particular monitor To scope the results to a particular monitor you can edit the above query to include a specific monitor name: SELECT average(duration), apdex(duration, t:), percentage(count(*), WHERE result='SUCCESS') FROM SyntheticCheck FACET timeperiod WHERE monitorName = 'mymonitorname' Copy Example #3: Report for multiple monitors To scope the results to a collection of monitors: SELECT average(duration), apdex(duration, t:), percentage(count(*), WHERE result='SUCCESS') FROM SyntheticCheck FACET timeperiod WHERE monitorName IN ('mymonitor1', 'mymonitor2', 'mymonitor3') Copy For more help Additional documentation resources include: Access your monitors (view your list of monitors, and view current summary statistics for each monitor) Add and edit monitors (edit your monitor settings to customize Apdex targets for individual monitors) APM SLA reports (SLA reporting for your APM application)",

      "body": "Read on to learn about synthetic monitoring's proxy settings and properties. Proxy settings API for scripted monitors Important You can set proxy server configuration for synthetic scripted monitors for monitor versions 0.4.0 or higher. The global object $network allows you to control the network configuration used by your synthetic scripted monitors. The following are applicable for both scripted browsers and API tests, unless otherwise stated. $network.setProxy(string or object PROXY URL) Sets a proxy server to be used for all per-URL requests (HTTP, HTTPS, and FTP). Additional notes: The port is optional. If not provided, it will be derived from the scheme. For example, for HTTP the port would be 80. The username and password are assumed to be the result of a call to encodeURIComponent(). Special characters like @ and : in the username and/or the password must be escaped. Returns This method returns a Promise that will resolve once the configuration has been applied. Parameters Parameter Data Type Description proxyURL | proxyUrlParsed String or Object The URL to connect to the proxy server. A string containing a proxyURL (for example, http://proxy_host:8888) or a plain object in the same format as defined by Node's url.parse(urlString) method. Examples An example of setting a proxy server with HTTP protocol on port 1234 with no authentication: $network.setProxy('http://host.com:1234') Copy An example of setting a proxy server with HTTP protocol with authentication credentials. $network.setProxy('http://proxyUsername:proxyPassword@proxyHost:1234') Copy $network.setProxyForHttp(string or object PROXY URL) Tip This call is exactly the same as the per-URL setProxy call, except that it applies to HTTP traffic. Sets a proxy server to be used for all HTTP requests. Additional notes: The port is optional. If not provided, it will be derived from the scheme. For example, for HTTP the port would be 80. The username and password are assumed to be the result of a call to encodeURIComponent(). Special characters like @ and : in the username and/or the password must be escaped. Returns This method returns a Promise that will resolve once the configuration has been applied. Parameters Parameter Data Type Description proxyURL | proxyUrlParsed String or Object The URL to connect to the proxy server. A string containing a proxyURL (for example, http://proxy_host:8888) or a plain object in the same format as defined by Node's url.parse(urlString) method. Examples An example of setting a proxy server with HTTP protocol on port 1234 with no authentication: $network.setProxyForHttp('http://host.com:1234') Copy An example of setting a proxy server with HTTP protocol with authentication credentials. $network.setProxyForHttp('http://proxyUsername:proxyPassword@proxyHost:1234') Copy $network.setProxyForHttps(string or object PROXY URL) Tip This call is exactly the same as the per-URL setProxy call, except that it applies to HTTPS traffic. Sets a proxy server to be used for all HTTPS requests. Additional notes: The port is optional. If not provided, it will be derived from the scheme. For example, for HTTP the default port would be 443. The username and password are assumed to be the result of a call to encodeURIComponent(). Special characters like @ and : in the username and/or the password must be escaped. Returns This method returns a Promise that will resolve once the configuration has been applied. Parameters Parameter Data Type Description proxyURL | proxyUrlParsed String or Object The URL to connect to the proxy server. A string containing a proxyURL (for example, http://proxy_host:8888) or a plain object in the same format as defined by Node's url.parse(urlString) method. Examples An example of setting a proxy server with HTTPS protocol on port 1234 with no authentication: $network.setProxyForHttps('https://host.com:1234') Copy An example of setting a proxy server with HTTPS protocol with authentication credentials. $network.setProxyForHttps('https://proxyUsername:proxyPassword@proxyHost:1234') Copy $network.setProxyPAC(string PAC SCRIPT URL, object AUTH OBJECT) Sets a proxy server via a proxy auto-config (PAC) script and returns a promise. This function is only available for scripted browser monitors. Returns This method returns a Promise that will resolve once the configuration has been applied. Parameters Parameter Data Type Description scriptURL String The URL of the PAC script. authCredentialsMap Object Map of authentication credentials to be provided to the proxy server(s), keyed by the hostnames of the proxy server. Values of this map must be defined in the format {username: 'authUsername', password: 'authPassword'} Examples An example of setting a proxy server via a proxy auto-config (PAC) script: var authCredentialsMap = { 'example.com': {username: 'authUsername', password: 'authPassword'}, } Copy $network.setProxyAdvanced(object PROXY RULES OBJECT) Tip This method is Chrome-specific: it only applies to scripted browser monitor types. It can be used to allow for a more flexible and complex proxy configuration. In most cases, this method will not be needed. Sets the proxy configuration using the format supported by Chrome Extension API for Proxying. The input is a ProxyRules object, as defined by the Chrome Extension API to configures proxies. You can add authCredentials for proxies that need it. See Parameters for more details. Returns This method returns a Promise that will resolve once the configuration has been applied. Parameters Parameter Data Type Description ProxyRules Object Object The proxyRulesObject is a plain object that follows the format ProxyRules as defined by the Chrome Extension API to configures proxies. This object is \"flavoured\" to fit our runtime: users can define an additional property, authCredentials, for the Proxy server objects to provide authentication credentials for a specific proxy server. authCredentials is an object in the format {username: 'authUsername', password: 'authPassword'}. Examples Here's an example of creating a proxyRules with authCredentials: var proxyRules = { singleProxy: { host:\"example.com\", authCredentials: { username: 'authUsername', password: 'authPassword' } } }; Copy Here's an example of setting up a proxied network with mixed network zone assets: var proxyRules = {singleProxy: {host:\"http://entproxy.mycompany.com\"}, bypassList:['s3.amazonaws.com','*.localcdn.com'] } $network.setProxyAdvanced(proxyRules) Copy $network.clearProxy() Clears/removes the current proxy configuration. Returns This method returns a Promise that will resolve once the configuration has been applied. $network.getProxy() This method returns the current proxy configuration. It must be synchronized in a promise callback. Examples An example of synchronizing getProxy with $network.setProxy(); and $network.clearProxy();: var assert = require('assert'); $network.setProxy(\"http://user:password@myproxyurl.com\") .then(function () { console.log('Proxy configuration applied'); //Note: $network.getProxy() is not synchronized with the webdriver Control Flow. //To make sure we get the proxy configuration after the call to setProxy() above // succeeds we need to use a promise callback var proxyData = $network.getProxy(); console.log(proxyData); }) .then(function () { // Again: getProxy() is not synchronized with the Webdriver Control Flow: we //need this promise callback otherwise clearProxy() might be called before the call // to getProxy() above returns return $network.clearProxy(); }) .then(function () { console.log('Proxy configuration cleared'); // We need this promise callback for reasons explained above var proxyData = $network.getProxy(); assert.equal(proxyData.rules, null); }); Copy Proxy properties Important This proxy information applies only to these versions: API monitors: 0.4.0, 0.2.2, 0.2.1, 0.1.0 Scripted monitors: 0.1.0 In order to analyze and collect your HTTP traffic metrics, New Relic must ensure the traffic passes through a conceptual funnel. Our synthetic monitoring includes a software funnel component capable of analyzing the HTTP requests or responses and then recording the information. New Relic's scripted browser monitors (versions 0.4.x and lower) include a mechanism to do this analysis without needing an HTTP proxy, so you don't have to configure anything. New Relic's API test (versions 0.4.x and lower) provides an $http object that is pre-configured to make the requests pass through the internal HTTP proxy. This allows you to write your test without including any proxy settings. If you want to use some other way to generate HTTP traffic while still collecting the HTTP traffic metrics, you can use $env.PROXY_HOST and $env.PROXY_PORT. To record traffic metrics, be sure to include these properties in your script.

      "body": "Synthetic monitoring is a suite of automated, scriptable tools to monitor your websites, critical business transactions, and API endpoints. You can simulate user traffic to proactively detect and resolve outages and poor performance of critical endpoints before your customers notice. Why it matters With synthetic monitoring, you can: Get the context of failures by connecting the availability and performance of endpoints to the underlying applications and infrastructure. Easily diagnose if an issue stems from the network or AWS location, a slow third party resource, or the health of backend services or infrastructure. Add synthetic monitoring into build automation and CI/CD pipelines to automatically track performance and check functionality for each deployment. Expand your monitoring further with real, Selenium-powered scripted browsers, which test login procedures, searches, and other critical business transactions. Monitor your API endpoints with API tests Advanced testing Synthetic monitoring allows you to proactively monitor your website or API endpoint to ensure your content is not only available, but fully functional. Synthetic monitoring browser tests send real, Selenium-powered Google Chrome browsers to your site from locations around the world to ensure your content is always up, everywhere. Scripted browsers expand your testing capabilities, so you can test uncommon user flows or beta-test complex procedures. For example, ensure your users are able to sign up for your newsletter, add an item to their cart, or search for and find a piece of critical content with a simple JavaScript-like language. Test your backend with API monitors, which allow you to run scripted tests against any API endpoint. Enhanced monitoring and reporting Synthetic monitoring aggregates the results of each check into metrics, allowing you to see patterns and identify causes of poor performance. Synthetic monitoring also stores each and every monitor result, so you can see exactly where your website broke down. Alerts notify you if your website or API endpoint is inaccessible. You can even expand your geographical coverage or monitor internal websites by creating private locations. You can also query your monitor results for a closer look. New Relic retains monitor results for thirteen months, ensuring you can compare usage year over year. Additional features Synthetic monitoring includes the following features: Feature Description Real browsers With simple browser and scripted browser monitors, synthetic monitoring doesn't simply check that your host is up. It loads the actual page content in a real, fully virtualized Google Chrome browser (powered by Selenium) to provide testing that mirrors your users' actions. Detailed results view Synthetic monitoring stores every single run of your monitor for 13 months, so you can view a detailed breakdown of each and every check. You can get a snapshot of your website's performance and availability, or hunt down specific problems. Comparative charts with browser monitoring Use New Relic's comparative charting feature for a direct page load time comparison between real user (browser monitoring) interactions and the synthetic monitors. For example, during a page outage, you can compare trends to see if an issue is also visible in synthetic monitoring, or if it is caused by other variables. Advanced scripted monitoring Use scripted browsers to run complex test cases against your website. Ensure critical processes like checkout and login are always running smoothly, and build a baseline to compare against when things go wrong. With a built-in scripting IDE based on Node.js, create scripts quickly without leaving your browser. Global test coverage Check coverage from locations around the world to ensure your users can access your website from anywhere, anytime. Monitor sites behind your firewall by adding the synthetic monitoring static IP addresses to your allow list. Use private locations to monitor internal sites or to expand your coverage to new locations. Compatibility with popular analytics platforms Synthetic monitoring specifically excludes scripts for popular analytics services, like Google Analytics. This ensures your analytics tools continue to receive the exact same data, even with thousands of monitors checking your website each month. You can unblock any of the services blocked by default, or block additional services. REST API functions Synthetic monitoring includes a REST API, which you can use to manage: Simple monitors and scripted monitors Categories and labels for monitors Alert notifications Data protection and privacy The data from synthetic monitoring is test data, representing typical interaction with the webpage or application. It is never actual data from human beings. The data collected when you use synthetic monitoring therefore is not personal data. For more information, see the Synthetic monitoring security documentation. Compatibility and requirements Synthetic monitoring does not require any software except a supported browser. Important To monitor a site behind your firewall, add the synthetic monitoring public minion IP addresses to your allow list. Permissions By default, all users in your account can: View synthetic monitoring pages. Add, edit, and delete monitors. For more fine-grained control, you can enable the optional permissions system. The permissions system allows you to manage the level of access for users to view and edit within synthetic monitoring (for example, monitors and private locations).",

Synthetic chart Description Load time chart This shows the load times for each monitor location. When you select a short time frame (such as 30 minutes), Synthetics displays the exact load time for each run of your monitor from each location. With longer time frames, Synthetics adjusts the resolution to show averages. To toggle the visibility of a location, select its label. Availability This shows the percentage of monitor runs that were successful. For a scripted monitor, the entire script must complete for the run to be considered a success. Above the selected monitor's Availability chart, an ellipsis icon appears. Use New Relic's comparative charting feature for a direct page load time comparison between real user (browser monitoring) interactions and the Synthetics monitors. Average load size This chart shows the amount of data (in kilobytes or megabytes) consumed in each run of the monitor. For scripted monitors, the entire script is included in the average load size graph. For example, a monitor that loads three pages will measure the size of all assets on all three pages. If your site is static, the average load size will be very consistent. For dynamic sites such as a news site, the average load size will vary as your page content changes. Slowest results This lists the five slowest results for the selected time frame. To view the performance breakdown, select a result. Monitor downtimes This lists the most recent monitor downtime incidents. To view additional details, select a downtime incident.

      "body": "Read on to learn about synthetic monitoring's proxy settings and properties. Proxy settings API for scripted monitors Important You can set proxy server configuration for synthetic scripted monitors for monitor versions 0.4.0 or higher. The global object $network allows you to control the network configuration used by your synthetic scripted monitors. The following are applicable for both scripted browsers and API tests, unless otherwise stated. $network.setProxy(string or object PROXY URL) Sets a proxy server to be used for all per-URL requests (HTTP, HTTPS, and FTP). Additional notes: The port is optional. If not provided, it will be derived from the scheme. For example, for HTTP the port would be 80. The username and password are assumed to be the result of a call to encodeURIComponent(). Special characters like @ and : in the username and/or the password must be escaped. Returns This method returns a Promise that will resolve once the configuration has been applied. Parameters Parameter Data Type Description proxyURL | proxyUrlParsed String or Object The URL to connect to the proxy server. A string containing a proxyURL (for example, http://proxy_host:8888) or a plain object in the same format as defined by Node's url.parse(urlString) method. Examples An example of setting a proxy server with HTTP protocol on port 1234 with no authentication: $network.setProxy('http://host.com:1234') Copy An example of setting a proxy server with HTTP protocol with authentication credentials. $network.setProxy('http://proxyUsername:proxyPassword@proxyHost:1234') Copy $network.setProxyForHttp(string or object PROXY URL) Tip This call is exactly the same as the per-URL setProxy call, except that it applies to HTTP traffic. Sets a proxy server to be used for all HTTP requests. Additional notes: The port is optional. If not provided, it will be derived from the scheme. For example, for HTTP the port would be 80. The username and password are assumed to be the result of a call to encodeURIComponent(). Special characters like @ and : in the username and/or the password must be escaped. Returns This method returns a Promise that will resolve once the configuration has been applied. Parameters Parameter Data Type Description proxyURL | proxyUrlParsed String or Object The URL to connect to the proxy server. A string containing a proxyURL (for example, http://proxy_host:8888) or a plain object in the same format as defined by Node's url.parse(urlString) method. Examples An example of setting a proxy server with HTTP protocol on port 1234 with no authentication: $network.setProxyForHttp('http://host.com:1234') Copy An example of setting a proxy server with HTTP protocol with authentication credentials. $network.setProxyForHttp('http://proxyUsername:proxyPassword@proxyHost:1234') Copy $network.setProxyForHttps(string or object PROXY URL) Tip This call is exactly the same as the per-URL setProxy call, except that it applies to HTTPS traffic. Sets a proxy server to be used for all HTTPS requests. Additional notes: The port is optional. If not provided, it will be derived from the scheme. For example, for HTTP the default port would be 443. The username and password are assumed to be the result of a call to encodeURIComponent(). Special characters like @ and : in the username and/or the password must be escaped. Returns This method returns a Promise that will resolve once the configuration has been applied. Parameters Parameter Data Type Description proxyURL | proxyUrlParsed String or Object The URL to connect to the proxy server. A string containing a proxyURL (for example, http://proxy_host:8888) or a plain object in the same format as defined by Node's url.parse(urlString) method. Examples An example of setting a proxy server with HTTPS protocol on port 1234 with no authentication: $network.setProxyForHttps('https://host.com:1234') Copy An example of setting a proxy server with HTTPS protocol with authentication credentials. $network.setProxyForHttps('https://proxyUsername:proxyPassword@proxyHost:1234') Copy $network.setProxyPAC(string PAC SCRIPT URL, object AUTH OBJECT) Sets a proxy server via a proxy auto-config (PAC) script and returns a promise. This function is only available for scripted browser monitors. Returns This method returns a Promise that will resolve once the configuration has been applied. Parameters Parameter Data Type Description scriptURL String The URL of the PAC script. authCredentialsMap Object Map of authentication credentials to be provided to the proxy server(s), keyed by the hostnames of the proxy server. Values of this map must be defined in the format {username: 'authUsername', password: 'authPassword'} Examples An example of setting a proxy server via a proxy auto-config (PAC) script: var authCredentialsMap = { 'example.com': {username: 'authUsername', password: 'authPassword'}, } Copy $network.setProxyAdvanced(object PROXY RULES OBJECT) Tip This method is Chrome-specific: it only applies to scripted browser monitor types. It can be used to allow for a more flexible and complex proxy configuration. In most cases, this method will not be needed. Sets the proxy configuration using the format supported by Chrome Extension API for Proxying. The input is a ProxyRules object, as defined by the Chrome Extension API to configures proxies. You can add authCredentials for proxies that need it. See Parameters for more details. Returns This method returns a Promise that will resolve once the configuration has been applied. Parameters Parameter Data Type Description ProxyRules Object Object The proxyRulesObject is a plain object that follows the format ProxyRules as defined by the Chrome Extension API to configures proxies. This object is \"flavoured\" to fit our runtime: users can define an additional property, authCredentials, for the Proxy server objects to provide authentication credentials for a specific proxy server. authCredentials is an object in the format {username: 'authUsername', password: 'authPassword'}. Examples Here's an example of creating a proxyRules with authCredentials: var proxyRules = { singleProxy: { host:\"example.com\", authCredentials: { username: 'authUsername', password: 'authPassword' } } }; Copy Here's an example of setting up a proxied network with mixed network zone assets: var proxyRules = {singleProxy: {host:\"http://entproxy.mycompany.com\"}, bypassList:['s3.amazonaws.com','*.localcdn.com'] } $network.setProxyAdvanced(proxyRules) Copy $network.clearProxy() Clears/removes the current proxy configuration. Returns This method returns a Promise that will resolve once the configuration has been applied. $network.getProxy() This method returns the current proxy configuration. It must be synchronized in a promise callback. Examples An example of synchronizing getProxy with $network.setProxy(); and $network.clearProxy();: var assert = require('assert'); $network.setProxy(\"http://user:password@myproxyurl.com\") .then(function () { console.log('Proxy configuration applied'); //Note: $network.getProxy() is not synchronized with the webdriver Control Flow. //To make sure we get the proxy configuration after the call to setProxy() above // succeeds we need to use a promise callback var proxyData = $network.getProxy(); console.log(proxyData); }) .then(function () { // Again: getProxy() is not synchronized with the Webdriver Control Flow: we //need this promise callback otherwise clearProxy() might be called before the call // to getProxy() above returns return $network.clearProxy(); }) .then(function () { console.log('Proxy configuration cleared'); // We need this promise callback for reasons explained above var proxyData = $network.getProxy(); assert.equal(proxyData.rules, null); }); Copy Proxy properties Important This proxy information applies only to these versions: API monitors: 0.4.0, 0.2.2, 0.2.1, 0.1.0 Scripted monitors: 0.1.0 In order to analyze and collect your HTTP traffic metrics, New Relic must ensure the traffic passes through a conceptual funnel. Our synthetic monitoring includes a software funnel component capable of analyzing the HTTP requests or responses and then recording the information. New Relic's scripted browser monitors (versions 0.4.x and lower) include a mechanism to do this analysis without needing an HTTP proxy, so you don't have to configure anything. New Relic's API test (versions 0.4.x and lower) provides an $http object that is pre-configured to make the requests pass through the internal HTTP proxy. This allows you to write your test without including any proxy settings. If you want to use some other way to generate HTTP traffic while still collecting the HTTP traffic metrics, you can use $env.PROXY_HOST and $env.PROXY_PORT. To record traffic metrics, be sure to include these properties in your script.

Understand SLA report metrics Use SLA reports to view aggregated performance metrics for a single monitor, or for all your monitors from the account-wide SLA Reports page. SLA reports include the following metrics: Duration: The average duration across all monitor results. Uptime: The percentage of all monitor results that ended successfully. For example, Monitor A might check 50 times per day, and Monitor B might check 150 times per day. If Monitor A has 29 successes out of 50 and Monitor B has 148 successes out of 150, the Uptime would be 88.5: (29+148)/(50+150)=88.5 For individual SLA reports, the uptime score only includes the selected monitor. Apdex: The average Apdex across all monitors. Monitors have a default Apdex T of 7 seconds, but you can customize Apdex T for individual monitors by editing their settings. Apdex F, which defines a frustrating result, is always four times Apdex T. For more information about Apdex, see Apdex: Measuring user satisfaction. For individual SLA reports, the Apdex score only includes the selected monitor. % Satisfied: The percentage of monitor results which complete in a \"satisfying\" time. A satisfying time is defined as a monitor result that completes in Apdex T or less. % Toleration: The percentage of monitor results which complete in a \"tolerable\" time. A tolerable time is greater than Apdex T, but less than Apdex F (four times Apdex T). % Frustrated: The percentage of monitor results which complete in a \"frustrating\" time. A frustrating time is greater than Apdex F (four times Apdex T). The account-wide SLA report includes all monitor types (ping, simple browser, scripted browser, and API test).

      "body": "Read on to learn about synthetic monitoring's proxy settings and properties. Proxy settings API for scripted monitors Important You can set proxy server configuration for synthetic scripted monitors for monitor versions 0.4.0 or higher. The global object $network allows you to control the network configuration used by your synthetic scripted monitors. The following are applicable for both scripted browsers and API tests, unless otherwise stated. $network.setProxy(string or object PROXY URL) Sets a proxy server to be used for all per-URL requests (HTTP, HTTPS, and FTP). Additional notes: The port is optional. If not provided, it will be derived from the scheme. For example, for HTTP the port would be 80. The username and password are assumed to be the result of a call to encodeURIComponent(). Special characters like @ and : in the username and/or the password must be escaped. Returns This method returns a Promise that will resolve once the configuration has been applied. Parameters Parameter Data Type Description proxyURL | proxyUrlParsed String or Object The URL to connect to the proxy server. A string containing a proxyURL (for example, http://proxy_host:8888) or a plain object in the same format as defined by Node's url.parse(urlString) method. Examples An example of setting a proxy server with HTTP protocol on port 1234 with no authentication: $network.setProxy('http://host.com:1234') Copy An example of setting a proxy server with HTTP protocol with authentication credentials. $network.setProxy('http://proxyUsername:proxyPassword@proxyHost:1234') Copy $network.setProxyForHttp(string or object PROXY URL) Tip This call is exactly the same as the per-URL setProxy call, except that it applies to HTTP traffic. Sets a proxy server to be used for all HTTP requests. Additional notes: The port is optional. If not provided, it will be derived from the scheme. For example, for HTTP the port would be 80. The username and password are assumed to be the result of a call to encodeURIComponent(). Special characters like @ and : in the username and/or the password must be escaped. Returns This method returns a Promise that will resolve once the configuration has been applied. Parameters Parameter Data Type Description proxyURL | proxyUrlParsed String or Object The URL to connect to the proxy server. A string containing a proxyURL (for example, http://proxy_host:8888) or a plain object in the same format as defined by Node's url.parse(urlString) method. Examples An example of setting a proxy server with HTTP protocol on port 1234 with no authentication: $network.setProxyForHttp('http://host.com:1234') Copy An example of setting a proxy server with HTTP protocol with authentication credentials. $network.setProxyForHttp('http://proxyUsername:proxyPassword@proxyHost:1234') Copy $network.setProxyForHttps(string or object PROXY URL) Tip This call is exactly the same as the per-URL setProxy call, except that it applies to HTTPS traffic. Sets a proxy server to be used for all HTTPS requests. Additional notes: The port is optional. If not provided, it will be derived from the scheme. For example, for HTTP the default port would be 443. The username and password are assumed to be the result of a call to encodeURIComponent(). Special characters like @ and : in the username and/or the password must be escaped. Returns This method returns a Promise that will resolve once the configuration has been applied. Parameters Parameter Data Type Description proxyURL | proxyUrlParsed String or Object The URL to connect to the proxy server. A string containing a proxyURL (for example, http://proxy_host:8888) or a plain object in the same format as defined by Node's url.parse(urlString) method. Examples An example of setting a proxy server with HTTPS protocol on port 1234 with no authentication: $network.setProxyForHttps('https://host.com:1234') Copy An example of setting a proxy server with HTTPS protocol with authentication credentials. $network.setProxyForHttps('https://proxyUsername:proxyPassword@proxyHost:1234') Copy $network.setProxyPAC(string PAC SCRIPT URL, object AUTH OBJECT) Sets a proxy server via a proxy auto-config (PAC) script and returns a promise. This function is only available for scripted browser monitors. Returns This method returns a Promise that will resolve once the configuration has been applied. Parameters Parameter Data Type Description scriptURL String The URL of the PAC script. authCredentialsMap Object Map of authentication credentials to be provided to the proxy server(s), keyed by the hostnames of the proxy server. Values of this map must be defined in the format {username: 'authUsername', password: 'authPassword'} Examples An example of setting a proxy server via a proxy auto-config (PAC) script: var authCredentialsMap = { 'example.com': {username: 'authUsername', password: 'authPassword'}, } Copy $network.setProxyAdvanced(object PROXY RULES OBJECT) Tip This method is Chrome-specific: it only applies to scripted browser monitor types. It can be used to allow for a more flexible and complex proxy configuration. In most cases, this method will not be needed. Sets the proxy configuration using the format supported by Chrome Extension API for Proxying. The input is a ProxyRules object, as defined by the Chrome Extension API to configures proxies. You can add authCredentials for proxies that need it. See Parameters for more details. Returns This method returns a Promise that will resolve once the configuration has been applied. Parameters Parameter Data Type Description ProxyRules Object Object The proxyRulesObject is a plain object that follows the format ProxyRules as defined by the Chrome Extension API to configures proxies. This object is \"flavoured\" to fit our runtime: users can define an additional property, authCredentials, for the Proxy server objects to provide authentication credentials for a specific proxy server. authCredentials is an object in the format {username: 'authUsername', password: 'authPassword'}. Examples Here's an example of creating a proxyRules with authCredentials: var proxyRules = { singleProxy: { host:\"example.com\", authCredentials: { username: 'authUsername', password: 'authPassword' } } }; Copy Here's an example of setting up a proxied network with mixed network zone assets: var proxyRules = {singleProxy: {host:\"http://entproxy.mycompany.com\"}, bypassList:['s3.amazonaws.com','*.localcdn.com'] } $network.setProxyAdvanced(proxyRules) Copy $network.clearProxy() Clears/removes the current proxy configuration. Returns This method returns a Promise that will resolve once the configuration has been applied. $network.getProxy() This method returns the current proxy configuration. It must be synchronized in a promise callback. Examples An example of synchronizing getProxy with $network.setProxy(); and $network.clearProxy();: var assert = require('assert'); $network.setProxy(\"http://user:password@myproxyurl.com\") .then(function () { console.log('Proxy configuration applied'); //Note: $network.getProxy() is not synchronized with the webdriver Control Flow. //To make sure we get the proxy configuration after the call to setProxy() above // succeeds we need to use a promise callback var proxyData = $network.getProxy(); console.log(proxyData); }) .then(function () { // Again: getProxy() is not synchronized with the Webdriver Control Flow: we //need this promise callback otherwise clearProxy() might be called before the call // to getProxy() above returns return $network.clearProxy(); }) .then(function () { console.log('Proxy configuration cleared'); // We need this promise callback for reasons explained above var proxyData = $network.getProxy(); assert.equal(proxyData.rules, null); }); Copy Proxy properties Important This proxy information applies only to these versions: API monitors: 0.4.0, 0.2.2, 0.2.1, 0.1.0 Scripted monitors: 0.1.0 In order to analyze and collect your HTTP traffic metrics, New Relic must ensure the traffic passes through a conceptual funnel. Our synthetic monitoring includes a software funnel component capable of analyzing the HTTP requests or responses and then recording the information. New Relic's scripted browser monitors (versions 0.4.x and lower) include a mechanism to do this analysis without needing an HTTP proxy, so you don't have to configure anything. New Relic's API test (versions 0.4.x and lower) provides an $http object that is pre-configured to make the requests pass through the internal HTTP proxy. This allows you to write your test without including any proxy settings. If you want to use some other way to generate HTTP traffic while still collecting the HTTP traffic metrics, you can use $env.PROXY_HOST and $env.PROXY_PORT. To record traffic metrics, be sure to include these properties in your script.

You can also view SLA reports for individual monitors: Go to one.newrelic.com > Synthetics > (select a monitor) > SLA. one.newrelic.com > Synthetics > SLA Report: Use SLA reports to understand your monitors' performance over time. Understand SLA report metrics Use SLA reports to view aggregated performance metrics for a single monitor, or for all your monitors from the account-wide SLA Reports page. SLA reports include the following metrics: Duration: The average duration across all monitor results. Uptime: The percentage of all monitor results that ended successfully. For example, Monitor A might check 50 times per day, and Monitor B might check 150 times per day. If Monitor A has 29 successes out of 50 and Monitor B has 148 successes out of 150, the Uptime would be 88.5: (29+148)/(50+150)=88.5 For individual SLA reports, the uptime score only includes the selected monitor. Apdex: The average Apdex across all monitors. Monitors have a default Apdex T of 7 seconds, but you can customize Apdex T for individual monitors by editing their settings. Apdex F, which defines a frustrating result, is always four times Apdex T. For more information about Apdex, see Apdex: Measuring user satisfaction. For individual SLA reports, the Apdex score only includes the selected monitor. % Satisfied: The percentage of monitor results which complete in a \"satisfying\" time. A satisfying time is defined as a monitor result that completes in Apdex T or less. % Toleration: The percentage of monitor results which complete in a \"tolerable\" time. A tolerable time is greater than Apdex T, but less than Apdex F (four times Apdex T). % Frustrated: The percentage of monitor results which complete in a \"frustrating\" time. A frustrating time is greater than Apdex F (four times Apdex T). The account-wide SLA report includes all monitor types (ping, simple browser, scripted browser, and API test).

You can also view SLA reports for individual monitors: Go to one.newrelic.com > Synthetics > (select a monitor) > SLA. one.newrelic.com > Synthetics > SLA Report: Use SLA reports to understand your monitors' performance over time. Understand SLA report metrics Use SLA reports to view aggregated performance metrics for a single monitor, or for all your monitors from the account-wide SLA Reports page. SLA reports include the following metrics: Duration: The average duration across all monitor results. Uptime: The percentage of all monitor results that ended successfully. For example, Monitor A might check 50 times per day, and Monitor B might check 150 times per day. If Monitor A has 29 successes out of 50 and Monitor B has 148 successes out of 150, the Uptime would be 88.5: (29+148)/(50+150)=88.5 For individual SLA reports, the uptime score only includes the selected monitor. Apdex: The average Apdex across all monitors. Monitors have a default Apdex T of 7 seconds, but you can customize Apdex T for individual monitors by editing their settings. Apdex F, which defines a frustrating result, is always four times Apdex T. For more information about Apdex, see Apdex: Measuring user satisfaction. For individual SLA reports, the Apdex score only includes the selected monitor. % Satisfied: The percentage of monitor results which complete in a \"satisfying\" time. A satisfying time is defined as a monitor result that completes in Apdex T or less. % Toleration: The percentage of monitor results which complete in a \"tolerable\" time. A tolerable time is greater than Apdex T, but less than Apdex F (four times Apdex T). % Frustrated: The percentage of monitor results which complete in a \"frustrating\" time. A frustrating time is greater than Apdex F (four times Apdex T). The account-wide SLA report includes all monitor types (ping, simple browser, scripted browser, and API test).

Synthetic chart Description Load time chart This shows the load times for each monitor location. When you select a short time frame (such as 30 minutes), Synthetics displays the exact load time for each run of your monitor from each location. With longer time frames, Synthetics adjusts the resolution to show averages. To toggle the visibility of a location, select its label. Availability This shows the percentage of monitor runs that were successful. For a scripted monitor, the entire script must complete for the run to be considered a success. Above the selected monitor's Availability chart, an ellipsis icon appears. Use New Relic's comparative charting feature for a direct page load time comparison between real user (browser monitoring) interactions and the Synthetics monitors. Average load size This chart shows the amount of data (in kilobytes or megabytes) consumed in each run of the monitor. For scripted monitors, the entire script is included in the average load size graph. For example, a monitor that loads three pages will measure the size of all assets on all three pages. If your site is static, the average load size will be very consistent. For dynamic sites such as a news site, the average load size will vary as your page content changes. Slowest results This lists the five slowest results for the selected time frame. To view the performance breakdown, select a result. Monitor downtimes This lists the most recent monitor downtime incidents. To view additional details, select a downtime incident.

Synthetic chart Description Load time chart This shows the load times for each monitor location. When you select a short time frame (such as 30 minutes), Synthetics displays the exact load time for each run of your monitor from each location. With longer time frames, Synthetics adjusts the resolution to show averages. To toggle the visibility of a location, select its label. Availability This shows the percentage of monitor runs that were successful. For a scripted monitor, the entire script must complete for the run to be considered a success. Above the selected monitor's Availability chart, an ellipsis icon appears. Use New Relic's comparative charting feature for a direct page load time comparison between real user (browser monitoring) interactions and the Synthetics monitors. Average load size This chart shows the amount of data (in kilobytes or megabytes) consumed in each run of the monitor. For scripted monitors, the entire script is included in the average load size graph. For example, a monitor that loads three pages will measure the size of all assets on all three pages. If your site is static, the average load size will be very consistent. For dynamic sites such as a news site, the average load size will vary as your page content changes. Slowest results This lists the five slowest results for the selected time frame. To view the performance breakdown, select a result. Monitor downtimes This lists the most recent monitor downtime incidents. To view additional details, select a downtime incident.

      "body": "Read on to learn about synthetic monitoring's proxy settings and properties. Proxy settings API for scripted monitors Important You can set proxy server configuration for synthetic scripted monitors for monitor versions 0.4.0 or higher. The global object $network allows you to control the network configuration used by your synthetic scripted monitors. The following are applicable for both scripted browsers and API tests, unless otherwise stated. $network.setProxy(string or object PROXY URL) Sets a proxy server to be used for all per-URL requests (HTTP, HTTPS, and FTP). Additional notes: The port is optional. If not provided, it will be derived from the scheme. For example, for HTTP the port would be 80. The username and password are assumed to be the result of a call to encodeURIComponent(). Special characters like @ and : in the username and/or the password must be escaped. Returns This method returns a Promise that will resolve once the configuration has been applied. Parameters Parameter Data Type Description proxyURL | proxyUrlParsed String or Object The URL to connect to the proxy server. A string containing a proxyURL (for example, http://proxy_host:8888) or a plain object in the same format as defined by Node's url.parse(urlString) method. Examples An example of setting a proxy server with HTTP protocol on port 1234 with no authentication: $network.setProxy('http://host.com:1234') Copy An example of setting a proxy server with HTTP protocol with authentication credentials. $network.setProxy('http://proxyUsername:proxyPassword@proxyHost:1234') Copy $network.setProxyForHttp(string or object PROXY URL) Tip This call is exactly the same as the per-URL setProxy call, except that it applies to HTTP traffic. Sets a proxy server to be used for all HTTP requests. Additional notes: The port is optional. If not provided, it will be derived from the scheme. For example, for HTTP the port would be 80. The username and password are assumed to be the result of a call to encodeURIComponent(). Special characters like @ and : in the username and/or the password must be escaped. Returns This method returns a Promise that will resolve once the configuration has been applied. Parameters Parameter Data Type Description proxyURL | proxyUrlParsed String or Object The URL to connect to the proxy server. A string containing a proxyURL (for example, http://proxy_host:8888) or a plain object in the same format as defined by Node's url.parse(urlString) method. Examples An example of setting a proxy server with HTTP protocol on port 1234 with no authentication: $network.setProxyForHttp('http://host.com:1234') Copy An example of setting a proxy server with HTTP protocol with authentication credentials. $network.setProxyForHttp('http://proxyUsername:proxyPassword@proxyHost:1234') Copy $network.setProxyForHttps(string or object PROXY URL) Tip This call is exactly the same as the per-URL setProxy call, except that it applies to HTTPS traffic. Sets a proxy server to be used for all HTTPS requests. Additional notes: The port is optional. If not provided, it will be derived from the scheme. For example, for HTTP the default port would be 443. The username and password are assumed to be the result of a call to encodeURIComponent(). Special characters like @ and : in the username and/or the password must be escaped. Returns This method returns a Promise that will resolve once the configuration has been applied. Parameters Parameter Data Type Description proxyURL | proxyUrlParsed String or Object The URL to connect to the proxy server. A string containing a proxyURL (for example, http://proxy_host:8888) or a plain object in the same format as defined by Node's url.parse(urlString) method. Examples An example of setting a proxy server with HTTPS protocol on port 1234 with no authentication: $network.setProxyForHttps('https://host.com:1234') Copy An example of setting a proxy server with HTTPS protocol with authentication credentials. $network.setProxyForHttps('https://proxyUsername:proxyPassword@proxyHost:1234') Copy $network.setProxyPAC(string PAC SCRIPT URL, object AUTH OBJECT) Sets a proxy server via a proxy auto-config (PAC) script and returns a promise. This function is only available for scripted browser monitors. Returns This method returns a Promise that will resolve once the configuration has been applied. Parameters Parameter Data Type Description scriptURL String The URL of the PAC script. authCredentialsMap Object Map of authentication credentials to be provided to the proxy server(s), keyed by the hostnames of the proxy server. Values of this map must be defined in the format {username: 'authUsername', password: 'authPassword'} Examples An example of setting a proxy server via a proxy auto-config (PAC) script: var authCredentialsMap = { 'example.com': {username: 'authUsername', password: 'authPassword'}, } Copy $network.setProxyAdvanced(object PROXY RULES OBJECT) Tip This method is Chrome-specific: it only applies to scripted browser monitor types. It can be used to allow for a more flexible and complex proxy configuration. In most cases, this method will not be needed. Sets the proxy configuration using the format supported by Chrome Extension API for Proxying. The input is a ProxyRules object, as defined by the Chrome Extension API to configures proxies. You can add authCredentials for proxies that need it. See Parameters for more details. Returns This method returns a Promise that will resolve once the configuration has been applied. Parameters Parameter Data Type Description ProxyRules Object Object The proxyRulesObject is a plain object that follows the format ProxyRules as defined by the Chrome Extension API to configures proxies. This object is \"flavoured\" to fit our runtime: users can define an additional property, authCredentials, for the Proxy server objects to provide authentication credentials for a specific proxy server. authCredentials is an object in the format {username: 'authUsername', password: 'authPassword'}. Examples Here's an example of creating a proxyRules with authCredentials: var proxyRules = { singleProxy: { host:\"example.com\", authCredentials: { username: 'authUsername', password: 'authPassword' } } }; Copy Here's an example of setting up a proxied network with mixed network zone assets: var proxyRules = {singleProxy: {host:\"http://entproxy.mycompany.com\"}, bypassList:['s3.amazonaws.com','*.localcdn.com'] } $network.setProxyAdvanced(proxyRules) Copy $network.clearProxy() Clears/removes the current proxy configuration. Returns This method returns a Promise that will resolve once the configuration has been applied. $network.getProxy() This method returns the current proxy configuration. It must be synchronized in a promise callback. Examples An example of synchronizing getProxy with $network.setProxy(); and $network.clearProxy();: var assert = require('assert'); $network.setProxy(\"http://user:password@myproxyurl.com\") .then(function () { console.log('Proxy configuration applied'); //Note: $network.getProxy() is not synchronized with the webdriver Control Flow. //To make sure we get the proxy configuration after the call to setProxy() above // succeeds we need to use a promise callback var proxyData = $network.getProxy(); console.log(proxyData); }) .then(function () { // Again: getProxy() is not synchronized with the Webdriver Control Flow: we //need this promise callback otherwise clearProxy() might be called before the call // to getProxy() above returns return $network.clearProxy(); }) .then(function () { console.log('Proxy configuration cleared'); // We need this promise callback for reasons explained above var proxyData = $network.getProxy(); assert.equal(proxyData.rules, null); }); Copy Proxy properties Important This proxy information applies only to these versions: API monitors: 0.4.0, 0.2.2, 0.2.1, 0.1.0 Scripted monitors: 0.1.0 In order to analyze and collect your HTTP traffic metrics, New Relic must ensure the traffic passes through a conceptual funnel. Our synthetic monitoring includes a software funnel component capable of analyzing the HTTP requests or responses and then recording the information. New Relic's scripted browser monitors (versions 0.4.x and lower) include a mechanism to do this analysis without needing an HTTP proxy, so you don't have to configure anything. New Relic's API test (versions 0.4.x and lower) provides an $http object that is pre-configured to make the requests pass through the internal HTTP proxy. This allows you to write your test without including any proxy settings. If you want to use some other way to generate HTTP traffic while still collecting the HTTP traffic metrics, you can use $env.PROXY_HOST and $env.PROXY_PORT. To record traffic metrics, be sure to include these properties in your script.

      "body": "You can use New Relic's containerized private minions (CPM). These are Docker container-based private minions that accept and execute synthetic monitors against your private locations. The CPM can operate in a Docker container system environment or a Kubernetes container orchestration system environment. The CPM will auto-detect its environment to select the appropriate operating mode. General private minion features Because the CPM operates as a container instead of a virtual machine, it delivers many features: Easy to install, start, and update Runs on: Linux macOS Windows Enhanced security and support for non-root user execution Ability to leverage a Docker container as a sandbox environment Customizable monitor check timeout Custom provided modules for scripted monitor types Kubernetes-specific features Also, the CPM delivers the following features in a Kubernetes environment: Integrates with the Kubernetes API to delegate runtime lifecycle management to Kubernetes Does not require privileged access to the Docker socket Supports hosted and on-premise Kubernetes clusters Supports various container engines such as Docker and Containerd Deployable via Helm charts as well as configuration YAMLs Allows job (ping vs. non-ping checks) based resource allocation for optimum resource management Observability offered via the New Relic One Kubernetes cluster explorer System requirements and compatibility To host CPMs, your system must meet the minimum requirements for the chosen system environment. Caution Do not modify any CPM files. New Relic is not liable for any modifications you make. For more information, contact your account representative or a New Relic technical sales rep. Docker container system environment requirements Compatibility for Requirements Operating system Linux kernel: 3.10 or higher macOS: 10.11 or higher Windows: Windows 10 64-bit or higher Processor A modern, multi-core CPU Memory 2.5 GiB of RAM per CPU core (dedicated) Disk space A minimum of 10 GB per host Docker version Docker 17.12.1-ce or higher Private location key You must have a private location key Caution Amazon ECS is not supported. Kubernetes container orchestration system environment requirements (CPM v3.0.0 or higher) Compatibility for Requirements Operating system Linux kernel: 3.10 or higher macOS: 10.11 or higher Windows: Windows 10 64-bit or higher Processor A modern, multi-core CPU Minion pod CPU (vCPU/Core): 0.5 up to 0.75 Memory: 800 Mi up to 1.6 Gi Resources allocated to a Minion pod are user configurable. Runner pod CPU (vCPU/Core): 0.5 up to 1 Memory: 1.25 Gi up to 3 Gi For a scripted API check, 1.25 Gi will be requested with a limit of 2.5 Gi. For a simple browser or scripted browser check, 2 Gi will be requested with a limit of 3 Gi. Additional considerations: Resources allocated to a runner pod are not user configurable. The maximum limit-request resource ratio for both CPU and memory is 2. Disk space Persistent volume (PV) of at least 10 Gi in size Note that if a ReadWriteOnce (RWO) PV is provided to the minion, an implicit node affinity will be established to ensure the minion and the runner containers are scheduled on the same node. This is required to allow the minion and the associated runners access to the PV, as an RWO PV can be accessed only by a single node in the cluster. Kubernetes version We recommend that your Kubernetes cluster supports Kubernetes v1.15. Caution We have identified a compatibility issue with Kubernetes v1.21+. A workaround is available by disabling the BoundServiceAccountTokenVolume feature gate on the cluster. Private location key You must have a private location key Helm Follow installation instructions for Helm v3 for your OS. Kubectl Follow installation instructions for Kubectl for your OS. To view versions, dependencies, default values for how many runner pods start with each minion, the Persistent volume access mode, and more, please see Show help and examples below. Private location key Before launching CPMs, you must have a private location key. Your CPM uses the key to authenticate against New Relic and run monitors associated with that private location. To find the key for existing private location: Go to one.newrelic.com > Synthetics > Private locations. In the Private locations index, locate the private location you want your CPM to be assigned to. Note the key associated with the private location with the key icon. Sandboxing and Docker dependencies Sandboxing and Docker dependencies are applicable to the CPM in a Docker container system environment. Docker dependencies The CPM runs in Docker and is able to leverage Docker as a sandboxing technology. This ensures complete isolation of the monitor execution, which improves security, reliability, and repeatability. Every time a scripted or browser monitor is executed, the CPM creates a brand new Docker container to run it in called a runner. The minion container needs to be configured to communicate with the Docker engine in order to spawn additional runner containers. Each spawned container is then dedicated to run a check associated with the synthetic monitor running on the private location the minion container is associated with. There are two crucial dependencies at launch. To enable sandboxing, ensure that: Your writable and executable directory is mounted at /tmp. The writable directory can be any directory you want the CPM to write into, but New Relic recommends the system's own /tmp to make things easy. Your writable Docker UNIX socket is mounted at /var/run/docker.sock or DOCKER_HOST environment variable. For more information, see Docker's Daemon socket option. Caution Core count on the host determines how many runner containers the CPM can run concurrently on the host. Since memory requirements are scaled to the expected count of runner containers, we recommend not running multiple CPMs on the same host to avoid resource contention. For additional information on sandboxing and running as a root or non-root user, see Security, sandboxing, and running as non-root. Install and update CPM versions Both installing and updating the CPM use the same command to pull the latest Docker image from the Quay.io repository where the CPM Docker image is hosted. Go to quay.io/repository/newrelic/synthetics-minion for a list of all the releases. CPM images are also hosted on Docker Hub. Go to hub.docker.com/r/newrelic/synthetics-minion/tags for a list of all the releases. Start the CPM To start the CPM, follow the applicable Docker or Kubernetes instructions. Docker start procedure Locate your private location key. Ensure you've enabled Docker dependencies for sandboxing and installed CPM on your system. Run the appropriate script for your system. Tailor the common defaults for /tmp and /var/run/docker.sock in the following examples to match your system. Linux/macOS: docker run \\ --name YOUR_CONTAINER_NAME \\ -e \"MINION_PRIVATE_LOCATION_KEY=YOUR_PRIVATE_LOCATION_KEY\" \\ -v /tmp:/tmp:rw \\ -v /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock:rw \\ -d \\ --restart unless-stopped \\ quay.io/newrelic/synthetics-minion:latest Copy Windows: docker run ^ --name YOUR_CONTAINER_NAME ^ -e \"MINION_PRIVATE_LOCATION_KEY=YOUR_PRIVATE_LOCATION_KEY\" ^ -v /tmp:/tmp:rw ^ -v /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock:rw ^ -d ^ --restart unless-stopped ^ quay.io/newrelic/synthetics-minion:latest Copy View the logs for your minion container: docker logs --follow YOUR_CONTAINER_NAME Copy When a message similar to Synthetics Minion is ready and servicing location YOUR_PRIVATE_LOCATION_LABEL appears, your CPM is up and ready to run monitors assigned to that location. Kubernetes start procedure Locate your private location key. Set up the a namespace for the CPM in your Kubernetes cluster: kubectl create namespace YOUR_NAMESPACE Copy Copy the Helm charts from the New Relic Helm repo. If you are copying the charts for the first time: helm repo add YOUR_REPO_NAME https://helm-charts.newrelic.com Copy If you previously copied the Helm charts from the New Relic Helm repo, then get the latest: helm repo update Copy Install the CPM with the following Helm command: For a fresh installation of the CPM: helm install YOUR_CPM_NAME YOUR_REPO_NAME/synthetics-minion -n YOUR_NAMESPACE --set synthetics.privateLocationKey=YOUR_PRIVATE_LOCATION_KEY Copy To update an existing CPM installation: helm upgrade YOUR_CPM_NAME YOUR_REPO_NAME/synthetics-minion -n YOUR_NAMESPACE --set synthetics.privateLocationKey=YOUR_PRIVATE_LOCATION_KEY Copy Check if the minion pod is up and running: kubectl get -n YOUR_NAMESPACE pods Copy Once the status attribute of each pod is shown as running, your CPM is up and ready to run monitors assigned to your private location. Stop or delete the CPM On a Docker container system environment, use the Docker stop procedure to stop the CPM from running. On a Kubernetes container orchestration system environment, use the Kubernetes delete procedure to stop the CPM from running. Docker stop procedure You can stop a Docker container either by the container name, or the container ID. Container name stop for Linux, macOS, and Windows: docker stop YOUR_CONTAINER_NAME docker rm YOUR_CONTAINER_NAME Copy Container ID stop for Linux/macOS: In the examples the container is stopped and removed. To only stop the container, omit docker rm $CONTAINER_ID. CONTAINER_ID=$(docker ps -aqf name=YOUR_CONTAINER_NAME) docker stop $CONTAINER_ID docker rm $CONTAINER_ID Copy Container ID stop for Windows: In the examples the container is stopped and removed. To only stop the container, omit docker rm $CONTAINER_ID. FOR /F \"tokens=*\" %%CID IN ('docker ps -aqf name=YOUR_CONTAINER_NAME') do (SET CONTAINER_ID=%%CID) docker stop %CONTAINER_ID% docker rm %CONTAINER_ID% Copy Kubernetes delete procedure Get the MINION_POD_INSTALLATION_NAME of the minion pod you want to delete: helm list -n YOUR_NAMESPACE Copy Delete the minion pod: helm uninstall -n YOUR_NAMESPACE MINION_POD_INSTALLATION_NAME Copy Delete the namespace set up for the CPM in your Kubernetes cluster: kubectl delete namespace YOUR_NAMESPACE Copy Show help and examples Use these options as applicable: To get a list of the most commonly used run options directly in the command line interface, run the show help command. To show CPM usage examples as well as the list of all the available run options, run this command: docker run quay.io/newrelic/synthetics-minion:latest help Copy To keep track of Docker logs and verify the health of your monitors, see Containerized private minion (CPM) maintenance and monitoring. For a CPM in the Kubernetes container orchestration system environment, the following Helm show commands can be used to view the chart.yaml and the values.yaml, respectively: helm show chart YOUR_REPO_NAME/synthetics-minion Copy helm show values YOUR_REPO_NAME/synthetics-minion Copy Show license information To show the licensing information for the open source software that we use in the CPM, run the LICENSE command. Run this command to view license information for CPM versions 2.2.27 or higher: docker run quay.io/newrelic/synthetics-minion:latest LICENSE Copy Some of our open-source software is listed under multiple software licenses, and in that case we have listed the license we've chosen to use. Our license information is also available in the our licenses documentation. Configure CPM You can configure the containerized private minion with custom npm modules, preserve data between launches, use environment variables, and more. For more information, see CPM configuration. Networks For both Docker and Kubernetes, the CPM and its runner containers will inherit network settings from the host. For an example of this on a Docker container system environment, see the Docker site. A new bridge network is created for each runner container. This means networking command options like --network and --dns passed to the CPM container at launch (such as through Docker run commands on a Docker container system environment) are not inherited or used by the runner containers. When these networks are created, they pull from the default IP address pool configured for daemon. For an example of this on a Docker container system environment, see the Docker site. Typically, the runner network is removed after the check is completed. However, if a CPM exits while a check is still running, or exits in another unexpected circumstance, these networks may get orphaned. This can potentially use up IP address space that is available to the Docker daemon. If this happens, you may see INTERNAL ENGINE ERROR code: 31 entries in your CPM logging when trying to create a new runner container. To clean these up in Docker container system environments only, run docker network prune. Security, sandboxing, and running as non-root By default, the software running inside a CPM is executed with root user privileges. This is suitable for most scenarios, as the execution is sandboxed. In a Docker container system environment: To change the default AppArmor profile used by containers that CPM spawns to run monitors, see the environment variable MINION_RUNNER_APPARMOR (CPM version 3.0.3 or higher) or MINION_DOCKER_RUNNER_APPARMOR (CPM version up to v3.0.2). To run the CPM as a non-root user, additional steps are required: Run as non-root user for Docker For more information, see Docker's official documentation about security and AppArmor security profiles. If your environment requires you to run the CPM as a non-root user, follow this procedure. In the following example, the non-root user is my_user. Ensure that my_user can use the Docker engine on the host: Verify that my_user belongs to the \"docker\" system group. OR Enable the Docker TCP socket option, and pass the DOCKER_HOST environment variable to CPM. Verify that my_user has read/write permissions to all the directories and volumes passed to CPM. To set these permission, use the chmod command. Get the uid of my_user for use in the run command: id -u my_user. Once these conditions are met, use the option \"-u <uid>:<gid>\" when launching CPM: docker run ... -u 1002 ... Copy OR docker run ... -u 1002 -e DOCKER_HOST=http://localhost:2375 ... Copy Docker image repository A single CPM Docker image serves both the Docker container system environment and Kubernetes container orchestration system environment. The Docker image is hosted on quay.io. To make sure your Docker image is up-to-date, see the quay.io newrelic/synthetics-minion repository. Additional considerations for CPM connection Connection Description CPMs without Internet access A CPM can operate without access to the internet, but with some exceptions. The public internet health check can be disabled using the environment variables named MINION_NETWORK_HEALTHCHECK_DISABLED for a Docker container system environment or synthetics.minionNetworkHealthCheckDisabled for a Kubernetes container orchestration system environment. The CPM needs to be able to contact the \"synthetics-horde.nr-data.net\" domain. This is necessary for it to report data to New Relic and to receive monitors to execute. Ask your network administration if this is a problem and how to set up exceptions. Communicate with Synthetics via a proxy To set up communication with New Relic by proxy, use the environment variables named MINION_API_PROXY*. Arguments passed at launch This applies to a Docker container environment only. Arguments passed to the CPM container at launch do not get passed on to the containers spawned by the CPM. Docker has no concept of \"inheritance\" or a \"hierarchy\" of containers, and we don't copy the configuration that is passed from CPM to the monitor-running containers. The only shared configuration between them is the one set at the Docker daemon level.",

      "body": "In synthetic monitoring, a private location is a collection of private minions. A minion is a containerized application that receives and manages jobs set up through the Synthetics UI. A private location can contain any number of private minions. Private locations allow you to extend your synthetic monitoring coverage to new geographical locations, and to monitor websites behind your firewall (like an intranet site). What you need To use private locations, first review these requirements and other factors: Compatibility for... Requirements Check budget Checks from a private location count against your budget. Synthetics horde endpoint For US-based accounts: https://synthetics-horde.nr-data.net/ For EU-based accounts: https://synthetics-horde.eu01.nr-data.net/ Outbound network access The minion needs to connect to the synthetic monitoring's horde endpoint to receive and process jobs. If your firewall rules don't permit direct access, you must configure proxy access. Test your connection to the horde endpoint with a successful response from the following command: curl -X GET https://synthetics-horde.nr-data.net/synthetics/api/v1/ping Copy Account access and permissions How access works depends on your user model: Original user model: If a private location is set up by an account with child accounts, it can be used by users with access to those child accounts. But if it's set up on a child account, it can only be used by users in that account. New Relic One user model: user access to an account depends on whether they've been granted access to that account. Create a private location one.newrelic.com > Synthetics > Private Locations: Use the Private Locations page to create, edit, and delete private locations. Before installing private minions, you need to create a private location. To create a new private location: Ensure you meet the requirements, including activating the feature by contacting your account representative. Go to one.newrelic.com > Synthetics > Private locations. Then select Create private location. Tip The Private locations sub menu becomes available after you create your first monitor. Type a location name. Optional: Configure these additional settings: Description: Describe your private location for other account users. Verified script execution: Require a passphrase when assigning scripts to this location, or when adding minions to the location. Select Create. After creating the location, Synthetics lists your Private location key so you can install a private minion. Ping monitor checks Each minion can run about 200 ping monitor checks per minute (about 8,640,000 checks per month). If the job queue for a particular location is growing, add additional minions. The exact capacity of the minions can vary, depending on: Your network performance The complexity of your scripts The hardware configuration for the private minion Add jobs to the location queue To add jobs to the queue for your location, follow standard procedures to add or edit a monitor, and select your location from the Private locations list. To assign an existing monitor, edit that monitor's settings. one.newrelic.com > Synthetics > Create monitor: To assign new jobs to your private location and its minions, select its name from the Create monitor page. Manage private locations Tip If you can't access this feature, check the Factors affecting access to features and data. Synthetic monitoring includes tools to manage locations and individual minions. You can also install new minions, and clear the job queue if it backs up. To access these tools, go to one.newrelic.com > Synthetics > Private locations. Then follow the steps: If you want to... Do this... Clear the job queue Click the icon, and select Clear queue. This is useful when the number of scheduled jobs has increased faster than the minions can process them, such as when the minion is offline. View the status of an individual minion Select the parent location's name from the list. The green health status indicator identifies active minions. You can also view the last reported time for each minion, and check whether the minion software is out of date. Change location or view the private location key Click the icon, and select Edit. Delete a location Click the icon for the location, and select Delete. This does not shut down any minions assigned to that location. The minions must be shut down manually or reassigned. Enable or disable verified script execution Legacy minions: Verified script execution requires that you set up a passphrase on the minion before assigning any scripts to the location. CPM: You need to pass the MINION_VSE_PASSPHRASE variable to the minion. Then, at the Private locations tab, click on Edit and, in the menu, enable the Verified script execution option. Set proxy configuration You can set proxy server configuration for synthetic scripted monitors that run from local private locations. For more information, see Synthetic's proxy settings.",

      "body": "You can use New Relic's containerized private minions (CPM). These are Docker container-based private minions that accept and execute synthetic monitors against your private locations. The CPM can operate in a Docker container system environment or a Kubernetes container orchestration system environment. The CPM will auto-detect its environment to select the appropriate operating mode. General private minion features Because the CPM operates as a container instead of a virtual machine, it delivers many features: Easy to install, start, and update Runs on: Linux macOS Windows Enhanced security and support for non-root user execution Ability to leverage a Docker container as a sandbox environment Customizable monitor check timeout Custom provided modules for scripted monitor types Kubernetes-specific features Also, the CPM delivers the following features in a Kubernetes environment: Integrates with the Kubernetes API to delegate runtime lifecycle management to Kubernetes Does not require privileged access to the Docker socket Supports hosted and on-premise Kubernetes clusters Supports various container engines such as Docker and Containerd Deployable via Helm charts as well as configuration YAMLs Allows job (ping vs. non-ping checks) based resource allocation for optimum resource management Observability offered via the New Relic One Kubernetes cluster explorer System requirements and compatibility To host CPMs, your system must meet the minimum requirements for the chosen system environment. Caution Do not modify any CPM files. New Relic is not liable for any modifications you make. For more information, contact your account representative or a New Relic technical sales rep. Docker container system environment requirements Compatibility for Requirements Operating system Linux kernel: 3.10 or higher macOS: 10.11 or higher Windows: Windows 10 64-bit or higher Processor A modern, multi-core CPU Memory 2.5 GiB of RAM per CPU core (dedicated) Disk space A minimum of 10 GB per host Docker version Docker 17.12.1-ce or higher Private location key You must have a private location key Caution Amazon ECS is not supported. Kubernetes container orchestration system environment requirements (CPM v3.0.0 or higher) Compatibility for Requirements Operating system Linux kernel: 3.10 or higher macOS: 10.11 or higher Windows: Windows 10 64-bit or higher Processor A modern, multi-core CPU Minion pod CPU (vCPU/Core): 0.5 up to 0.75 Memory: 800 Mi up to 1.6 Gi Resources allocated to a Minion pod are user configurable. Runner pod CPU (vCPU/Core): 0.5 up to 1 Memory: 1.25 Gi up to 3 Gi For a scripted API check, 1.25 Gi will be requested with a limit of 2.5 Gi. For a simple browser or scripted browser check, 2 Gi will be requested with a limit of 3 Gi. Additional considerations: Resources allocated to a runner pod are not user configurable. The maximum limit-request resource ratio for both CPU and memory is 2. Disk space Persistent volume (PV) of at least 10 Gi in size Note that if a ReadWriteOnce (RWO) PV is provided to the minion, an implicit node affinity will be established to ensure the minion and the runner containers are scheduled on the same node. This is required to allow the minion and the associated runners access to the PV, as an RWO PV can be accessed only by a single node in the cluster. Kubernetes version We recommend that your Kubernetes cluster supports Kubernetes v1.15. Caution We have identified a compatibility issue with Kubernetes v1.21+. A workaround is available by disabling the BoundServiceAccountTokenVolume feature gate on the cluster. Private location key You must have a private location key Helm Follow installation instructions for Helm v3 for your OS. Kubectl Follow installation instructions for Kubectl for your OS. To view versions, dependencies, default values for how many runner pods start with each minion, the Persistent volume access mode, and more, please see Show help and examples below. Private location key Before launching CPMs, you must have a private location key. Your CPM uses the key to authenticate against New Relic and run monitors associated with that private location. To find the key for existing private location: Go to one.newrelic.com > Synthetics > Private locations. In the Private locations index, locate the private location you want your CPM to be assigned to. Note the key associated with the private location with the key icon. Sandboxing and Docker dependencies Sandboxing and Docker dependencies are applicable to the CPM in a Docker container system environment. Docker dependencies The CPM runs in Docker and is able to leverage Docker as a sandboxing technology. This ensures complete isolation of the monitor execution, which improves security, reliability, and repeatability. Every time a scripted or browser monitor is executed, the CPM creates a brand new Docker container to run it in called a runner. The minion container needs to be configured to communicate with the Docker engine in order to spawn additional runner containers. Each spawned container is then dedicated to run a check associated with the synthetic monitor running on the private location the minion container is associated with. There are two crucial dependencies at launch. To enable sandboxing, ensure that: Your writable and executable directory is mounted at /tmp. The writable directory can be any directory you want the CPM to write into, but New Relic recommends the system's own /tmp to make things easy. Your writable Docker UNIX socket is mounted at /var/run/docker.sock or DOCKER_HOST environment variable. For more information, see Docker's Daemon socket option. Caution Core count on the host determines how many runner containers the CPM can run concurrently on the host. Since memory requirements are scaled to the expected count of runner containers, we recommend not running multiple CPMs on the same host to avoid resource contention. For additional information on sandboxing and running as a root or non-root user, see Security, sandboxing, and running as non-root. Install and update CPM versions Both installing and updating the CPM use the same command to pull the latest Docker image from the Quay.io repository where the CPM Docker image is hosted. Go to quay.io/repository/newrelic/synthetics-minion for a list of all the releases. CPM images are also hosted on Docker Hub. Go to hub.docker.com/r/newrelic/synthetics-minion/tags for a list of all the releases. Start the CPM To start the CPM, follow the applicable Docker or Kubernetes instructions. Docker start procedure Locate your private location key. Ensure you've enabled Docker dependencies for sandboxing and installed CPM on your system. Run the appropriate script for your system. Tailor the common defaults for /tmp and /var/run/docker.sock in the following examples to match your system. Linux/macOS: docker run \\ --name YOUR_CONTAINER_NAME \\ -e \"MINION_PRIVATE_LOCATION_KEY=YOUR_PRIVATE_LOCATION_KEY\" \\ -v /tmp:/tmp:rw \\ -v /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock:rw \\ -d \\ --restart unless-stopped \\ quay.io/newrelic/synthetics-minion:latest Copy Windows: docker run ^ --name YOUR_CONTAINER_NAME ^ -e \"MINION_PRIVATE_LOCATION_KEY=YOUR_PRIVATE_LOCATION_KEY\" ^ -v /tmp:/tmp:rw ^ -v /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock:rw ^ -d ^ --restart unless-stopped ^ quay.io/newrelic/synthetics-minion:latest Copy View the logs for your minion container: docker logs --follow YOUR_CONTAINER_NAME Copy When a message similar to Synthetics Minion is ready and servicing location YOUR_PRIVATE_LOCATION_LABEL appears, your CPM is up and ready to run monitors assigned to that location. Kubernetes start procedure Locate your private location key. Set up the a namespace for the CPM in your Kubernetes cluster: kubectl create namespace YOUR_NAMESPACE Copy Copy the Helm charts from the New Relic Helm repo. If you are copying the charts for the first time: helm repo add YOUR_REPO_NAME https://helm-charts.newrelic.com Copy If you previously copied the Helm charts from the New Relic Helm repo, then get the latest: helm repo update Copy Install the CPM with the following Helm command: For a fresh installation of the CPM: helm install YOUR_CPM_NAME YOUR_REPO_NAME/synthetics-minion -n YOUR_NAMESPACE --set synthetics.privateLocationKey=YOUR_PRIVATE_LOCATION_KEY Copy To update an existing CPM installation: helm upgrade YOUR_CPM_NAME YOUR_REPO_NAME/synthetics-minion -n YOUR_NAMESPACE --set synthetics.privateLocationKey=YOUR_PRIVATE_LOCATION_KEY Copy Check if the minion pod is up and running: kubectl get -n YOUR_NAMESPACE pods Copy Once the status attribute of each pod is shown as running, your CPM is up and ready to run monitors assigned to your private location. Stop or delete the CPM On a Docker container system environment, use the Docker stop procedure to stop the CPM from running. On a Kubernetes container orchestration system environment, use the Kubernetes delete procedure to stop the CPM from running. Docker stop procedure You can stop a Docker container either by the container name, or the container ID.

To show CPM usage examples as well as the list of all the available run options, run this command: docker run quay.io/newrelic/synthetics-minion:latest help Copy To keep track of Docker logs and verify the health of your monitors, see Containerized private minion (CPM) maintenance and monitoring. For a CPM in the Kubernetes container orchestration system environment, the following Helm show commands can be used to view the chart.yaml and the values.yaml, respectively: helm show chart YOUR_REPO_NAME/synthetics-minion Copy helm show values YOUR_REPO_NAME/synthetics-minion Copy Show license information To show the licensing information for the open source software that we use in the CPM, run the LICENSE command. Run this command to view license information for CPM versions 2.2.27 or higher: docker run quay.io/newrelic/synthetics-minion:latest LICENSE Copy Some of our open-source software is listed under multiple software licenses, and in that case we have listed the license we've chosen to use. Our license information is also available in the our licenses documentation. Configure CPM You can configure the containerized private minion with custom npm modules, preserve data between launches, use environment variables, and more. For more information, see CPM configuration. Networks For both Docker and Kubernetes, the CPM and its runner containers will inherit network settings from the host. For an example of this on a Docker container system environment, see the Docker site. A new bridge network is created for each runner container. This means networking command options like --network and --dns passed to the CPM container at launch (such as through Docker run commands on a Docker container system environment) are not inherited or used by the runner containers. When these networks are created, they pull from the default IP address pool configured for daemon. For an example of this on a Docker container system environment, see the Docker site. Typically, the runner network is removed after the check is completed. However, if a CPM exits while a check is still running, or exits in another unexpected circumstance, these networks may get orphaned. This can potentially use up IP address space that is available to the Docker daemon. If this happens, you may see INTERNAL ENGINE ERROR code: 31 entries in your CPM logging when trying to create a new runner container. To clean these up in Docker container system environments only, run docker network prune. Security, sandboxing, and running as non-root By default, the software running inside a CPM is executed with root user privileges. This is suitable for most scenarios, as the execution is sandboxed. In a Docker container system environment: To change the default AppArmor profile used by containers that CPM spawns to run monitors, see the environment variable MINION_RUNNER_APPARMOR (CPM version 3.0.3 or higher) or MINION_DOCKER_RUNNER_APPARMOR (CPM version up to v3.0.2). To run the CPM as a non-root user, additional steps are required: Run as non-root user for Docker For more information, see Docker's official documentation about security and AppArmor security profiles. If your environment requires you to run the CPM as a non-root user, follow this procedure. In the following example, the non-root user is my_user. Ensure that my_user can use the Docker engine on the host: Verify that my_user belongs to the \"docker\" system group. OR Enable the Docker TCP socket option, and pass the DOCKER_HOST environment variable to CPM. Verify that my_user has read/write permissions to all the directories and volumes passed to CPM. To set these permission, use the chmod command. Get the uid of my_user for use in the run command: id -u my_user. Once these conditions are met, use the option \"-u <uid>:<gid>\" when launching CPM: docker run ... -u 1002 ... Copy OR docker run ... -u 1002 -e DOCKER_HOST=http://localhost:2375 ... Copy Docker image repository A single CPM Docker image serves both the Docker container system environment and Kubernetes container orchestration system environment. The Docker image is hosted on quay.io. To make sure your Docker image is up-to-date, see the quay.io newrelic/synthetics-minion repository. Additional considerations for CPM connection Connection Description CPMs without Internet access A CPM can operate without access to the internet, but with some exceptions. The public internet health check can be disabled using the environment variables named MINION_NETWORK_HEALTHCHECK_DISABLED for a Docker container system environment or synthetics.minionNetworkHealthCheckDisabled for a Kubernetes container orchestration system environment. The CPM needs to be able to contact the \"synthetics-horde.nr-data.net\" domain. This is necessary for it to report data to New Relic and to receive monitors to execute. Ask your network administration if this is a problem and how to set up exceptions. Communicate with Synthetics via a proxy To set up communication with New Relic by proxy, use the environment variables named MINION_API_PROXY*. Arguments passed at launch This applies to a Docker container environment only. Arguments passed to the CPM container at launch do not get passed on to the containers spawned by the CPM. Docker has no concept of \"inheritance\" or a \"hierarchy\" of containers, and we don't copy the configuration that is passed from CPM to the monitor-running containers. The only shared configuration between them is the one set at the Docker daemon level.",

Understand SLA report metrics Use SLA reports to view aggregated performance metrics for a single monitor, or for all your monitors from the account-wide SLA Reports page. SLA reports include the following metrics: Duration: The average duration across all monitor results. Uptime: The percentage of all monitor results that ended successfully. For example, Monitor A might check 50 times per day, and Monitor B might check 150 times per day. If Monitor A has 29 successes out of 50 and Monitor B has 148 successes out of 150, the Uptime would be 88.5: (29+148)/(50+150)=88.5 For individual SLA reports, the uptime score only includes the selected monitor. Apdex: The average Apdex across all monitors. Monitors have a default Apdex T of 7 seconds, but you can customize Apdex T for individual monitors by editing their settings. Apdex F, which defines a frustrating result, is always four times Apdex T. For more information about Apdex, see Apdex: Measuring user satisfaction. For individual SLA reports, the Apdex score only includes the selected monitor. % Satisfied: The percentage of monitor results which complete in a \"satisfying\" time. A satisfying time is defined as a monitor result that completes in Apdex T or less. % Toleration: The percentage of monitor results which complete in a \"tolerable\" time. A tolerable time is greater than Apdex T, but less than Apdex F (four times Apdex T). % Frustrated: The percentage of monitor results which complete in a \"frustrating\" time.

      "body": "You can use New Relic's containerized private minions (CPM). These are Docker container-based private minions that accept and execute synthetic monitors against your private locations. The CPM can operate in a Docker container system environment or a Kubernetes container orchestration system environment. The CPM will auto-detect its environment to select the appropriate operating mode. General private minion features Because the CPM operates as a container instead of a virtual machine, it delivers many features: Easy to install, start, and update Runs on: Linux macOS Windows Enhanced security and support for non-root user execution Ability to leverage a Docker container as a sandbox environment Customizable monitor check timeout Custom provided modules for scripted monitor types Kubernetes-specific features Also, the CPM delivers the following features in a Kubernetes environment: Integrates with the Kubernetes API to delegate runtime lifecycle management to Kubernetes Does not require privileged access to the Docker socket Supports hosted and on-premise Kubernetes clusters Supports various container engines such as Docker and Containerd Deployable via Helm charts as well as configuration YAMLs Allows job (ping vs. non-ping checks) based resource allocation for optimum resource management Observability offered via the New Relic One Kubernetes cluster explorer System requirements and compatibility To host CPMs, your system must meet the minimum requirements for the chosen system environment. Caution Do not modify any CPM files. New Relic is not liable for any modifications you make. For more information, contact your account representative or a New Relic technical sales rep. Docker container system environment requirements Compatibility for Requirements Operating system Linux kernel: 3.10 or higher macOS: 10.11 or higher Windows: Windows 10 64-bit or higher Processor A modern, multi-core CPU Memory 2.5 GiB of RAM per CPU core (dedicated) Disk space A minimum of 10 GB per host Docker version Docker 17.12.1-ce or higher Private location key You must have a private location key Caution Amazon ECS is not supported. Kubernetes container orchestration system environment requirements (CPM v3.0.0 or higher) Compatibility for Requirements Operating system Linux kernel: 3.10 or higher macOS: 10.11 or higher Windows: Windows 10 64-bit or higher Processor A modern, multi-core CPU Minion pod CPU (vCPU/Core): 0.5 up to 0.75 Memory: 800 Mi up to 1.6 Gi Resources allocated to a Minion pod are user configurable. Runner pod CPU (vCPU/Core): 0.5 up to 1 Memory: 1.25 Gi up to 3 Gi For a scripted API check, 1.25 Gi will be requested with a limit of 2.5 Gi. For a simple browser or scripted browser check, 2 Gi will be requested with a limit of 3 Gi. Additional considerations: Resources allocated to a runner pod are not user configurable. The maximum limit-request resource ratio for both CPU and memory is 2. Disk space Persistent volume (PV) of at least 10 Gi in size Note that if a ReadWriteOnce (RWO) PV is provided to the minion, an implicit node affinity will be established to ensure the minion and the runner containers are scheduled on the same node. This is required to allow the minion and the associated runners access to the PV, as an RWO PV can be accessed only by a single node in the cluster. Kubernetes version We recommend that your Kubernetes cluster supports Kubernetes v1.15. Caution We have identified a compatibility issue with Kubernetes v1.21+. A workaround is available by disabling the BoundServiceAccountTokenVolume feature gate on the cluster. Private location key You must have a private location key Helm Follow installation instructions for Helm v3 for your OS. Kubectl Follow installation instructions for Kubectl for your OS. To view versions, dependencies, default values for how many runner pods start with each minion, the Persistent volume access mode, and more, please see Show help and examples below. Private location key Before launching CPMs, you must have a private location key. Your CPM uses the key to authenticate against New Relic and run monitors associated with that private location. To find the key for existing private location: Go to one.newrelic.com > Synthetics > Private locations. In the Private locations index, locate the private location you want your CPM to be assigned to. Note the key associated with the private location with the key icon. Sandboxing and Docker dependencies Sandboxing and Docker dependencies are applicable to the CPM in a Docker container system environment. Docker dependencies The CPM runs in Docker and is able to leverage Docker as a sandboxing technology. This ensures complete isolation of the monitor execution, which improves security, reliability, and repeatability. Every time a scripted or browser monitor is executed, the CPM creates a brand new Docker container to run it in called a runner. The minion container needs to be configured to communicate with the Docker engine in order to spawn additional runner containers. Each spawned container is then dedicated to run a check associated with the synthetic monitor running on the private location the minion container is associated with. There are two crucial dependencies at launch. To enable sandboxing, ensure that: Your writable and executable directory is mounted at /tmp. The writable directory can be any directory you want the CPM to write into, but New Relic recommends the system's own /tmp to make things easy. Your writable Docker UNIX socket is mounted at /var/run/docker.sock or DOCKER_HOST environment variable. For more information, see Docker's Daemon socket option. Caution Core count on the host determines how many runner containers the CPM can run concurrently on the host. Since memory requirements are scaled to the expected count of runner containers, we recommend not running multiple CPMs on the same host to avoid resource contention. For additional information on sandboxing and running as a root or non-root user, see Security, sandboxing, and running as non-root. Install and update CPM versions Both installing and updating the CPM use the same command to pull the latest Docker image from the Quay.io repository where the CPM Docker image is hosted. Go to quay.io/repository/newrelic/synthetics-minion for a list of all the releases. CPM images are also hosted on Docker Hub. Go to hub.docker.com/r/newrelic/synthetics-minion/tags for a list of all the releases. Start the CPM To start the CPM, follow the applicable Docker or Kubernetes instructions. Docker start procedure Locate your private location key. Ensure you've enabled Docker dependencies for sandboxing and installed CPM on your system. Run the appropriate script for your system. Tailor the common defaults for /tmp and /var/run/docker.sock in the following examples to match your system. Linux/macOS: docker run \\ --name YOUR_CONTAINER_NAME \\ -e \"MINION_PRIVATE_LOCATION_KEY=YOUR_PRIVATE_LOCATION_KEY\" \\ -v /tmp:/tmp:rw \\ -v /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock:rw \\ -d \\ --restart unless-stopped \\ quay.io/newrelic/synthetics-minion:latest Copy Windows: docker run ^ --name YOUR_CONTAINER_NAME ^ -e \"MINION_PRIVATE_LOCATION_KEY=YOUR_PRIVATE_LOCATION_KEY\" ^ -v /tmp:/tmp:rw ^ -v /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock:rw ^ -d ^ --restart unless-stopped ^ quay.io/newrelic/synthetics-minion:latest Copy View the logs for your minion container: docker logs --follow YOUR_CONTAINER_NAME Copy When a message similar to Synthetics Minion is ready and servicing location YOUR_PRIVATE_LOCATION_LABEL appears, your CPM is up and ready to run monitors assigned to that location. Kubernetes start procedure Locate your private location key. Set up the a namespace for the CPM in your Kubernetes cluster: kubectl create namespace YOUR_NAMESPACE Copy Copy the Helm charts from the New Relic Helm repo. If you are copying the charts for the first time: helm repo add YOUR_REPO_NAME https://helm-charts.newrelic.com Copy If you previously copied the Helm charts from the New Relic Helm repo, then get the latest: helm repo update Copy Install the CPM with the following Helm command: For a fresh installation of the CPM: helm install YOUR_CPM_NAME YOUR_REPO_NAME/synthetics-minion -n YOUR_NAMESPACE --set synthetics.privateLocationKey=YOUR_PRIVATE_LOCATION_KEY Copy To update an existing CPM installation: helm upgrade YOUR_CPM_NAME YOUR_REPO_NAME/synthetics-minion -n YOUR_NAMESPACE --set synthetics.privateLocationKey=YOUR_PRIVATE_LOCATION_KEY Copy Check if the minion pod is up and running: kubectl get -n YOUR_NAMESPACE pods Copy Once the status attribute of each pod is shown as running, your CPM is up and ready to run monitors assigned to your private location. Stop or delete the CPM On a Docker container system environment, use the Docker stop procedure to stop the CPM from running. On a Kubernetes container orchestration system environment, use the Kubernetes delete procedure to stop the CPM from running. Docker stop procedure You can stop a Docker container either by the container name, or the container ID. Container name stop for Linux, macOS, and Windows: docker stop YOUR_CONTAINER_NAME docker rm YOUR_CONTAINER_NAME Copy Container ID stop for Linux/macOS: In the examples the container is stopped and removed. To only stop the container, omit docker rm $CONTAINER_ID. CONTAINER_ID=$(docker ps -aqf name=YOUR_CONTAINER_NAME) docker stop $CONTAINER_ID docker rm $CONTAINER_ID Copy Container ID stop for Windows: In the examples the container is stopped and removed. To only stop the container, omit docker rm $CONTAINER_ID. FOR /F \"tokens=*\" %%CID IN ('docker ps -aqf name=YOUR_CONTAINER_NAME') do (SET CONTAINER_ID=%%CID) docker stop %CONTAINER_ID% docker rm %CONTAINER_ID% Copy Kubernetes delete procedure Get the MINION_POD_INSTALLATION_NAME of the minion pod you want to delete: helm list -n YOUR_NAMESPACE Copy Delete the minion pod: helm uninstall -n YOUR_NAMESPACE MINION_POD_INSTALLATION_NAME Copy Delete the namespace set up for the CPM in your Kubernetes cluster: kubectl delete namespace YOUR_NAMESPACE Copy Show help and examples Use these options as applicable: To get a list of the most commonly used run options directly in the command line interface, run the show help command. To show CPM usage examples as well as the list of all the available run options, run this command: docker run quay.io/newrelic/synthetics-minion:latest help Copy To keep track of Docker logs and verify the health of your monitors, see Containerized private minion (CPM) maintenance and monitoring. For a CPM in the Kubernetes container orchestration system environment, the following Helm show commands can be used to view the chart.yaml and the values.yaml, respectively: helm show chart YOUR_REPO_NAME/synthetics-minion Copy helm show values YOUR_REPO_NAME/synthetics-minion Copy Show license information To show the licensing information for the open source software that we use in the CPM, run the LICENSE command. Run this command to view license information for CPM versions 2.2.27 or higher: docker run quay.io/newrelic/synthetics-minion:latest LICENSE Copy Some of our open-source software is listed under multiple software licenses, and in that case we have listed the license we've chosen to use. Our license information is also available in the our licenses documentation. Configure CPM You can configure the containerized private minion with custom npm modules, preserve data between launches, use environment variables, and more. For more information, see CPM configuration. Networks For both Docker and Kubernetes, the CPM and its runner containers will inherit network settings from the host. For an example of this on a Docker container system environment, see the Docker site. A new bridge network is created for each runner container. This means networking command options like --network and --dns passed to the CPM container at launch (such as through Docker run commands on a Docker container system environment) are not inherited or used by the runner containers. When these networks are created, they pull from the default IP address pool configured for daemon. For an example of this on a Docker container system environment, see the Docker site. Typically, the runner network is removed after the check is completed. However, if a CPM exits while a check is still running, or exits in another unexpected circumstance, these networks may get orphaned. This can potentially use up IP address space that is available to the Docker daemon. If this happens, you may see INTERNAL ENGINE ERROR code: 31 entries in your CPM logging when trying to create a new runner container. To clean these up in Docker container system environments only, run docker network prune. Security, sandboxing, and running as non-root By default, the software running inside a CPM is executed with root user privileges. This is suitable for most scenarios, as the execution is sandboxed. In a Docker container system environment: To change the default AppArmor profile used by containers that CPM spawns to run monitors, see the environment variable MINION_RUNNER_APPARMOR (CPM version 3.0.3 or higher) or MINION_DOCKER_RUNNER_APPARMOR (CPM version up to v3.0.2). To run the CPM as a non-root user, additional steps are required: Run as non-root user for Docker For more information, see Docker's official documentation about security and AppArmor security profiles. If your environment requires you to run the CPM as a non-root user, follow this procedure. In the following example, the non-root user is my_user. Ensure that my_user can use the Docker engine on the host: Verify that my_user belongs to the \"docker\" system group. OR Enable the Docker TCP socket option, and pass the DOCKER_HOST environment variable to CPM. Verify that my_user has read/write permissions to all the directories and volumes passed to CPM. To set these permission, use the chmod command. Get the uid of my_user for use in the run command: id -u my_user. Once these conditions are met, use the option \"-u <uid>:<gid>\" when launching CPM: docker run ... -u 1002 ... Copy OR docker run ... -u 1002 -e DOCKER_HOST=http://localhost:2375 ... Copy Docker image repository A single CPM Docker image serves both the Docker container system environment and Kubernetes container orchestration system environment. The Docker image is hosted on quay.io. To make sure your Docker image is up-to-date, see the quay.io newrelic/synthetics-minion repository. Additional considerations for CPM connection Connection Description CPMs without Internet access A CPM can operate without access to the internet, but with some exceptions. The public internet health check can be disabled using the environment variables named MINION_NETWORK_HEALTHCHECK_DISABLED for a Docker container system environment or synthetics.minionNetworkHealthCheckDisabled for a Kubernetes container orchestration system environment. The CPM needs to be able to contact the \"synthetics-horde.nr-data.net\" domain. This is necessary for it to report data to New Relic and to receive monitors to execute. Ask your network administration if this is a problem and how to set up exceptions. Communicate with Synthetics via a proxy To set up communication with New Relic by proxy, use the environment variables named MINION_API_PROXY*. Arguments passed at launch This applies to a Docker container environment only. Arguments passed to the CPM container at launch do not get passed on to the containers spawned by the CPM. Docker has no concept of \"inheritance\" or a \"hierarchy\" of containers, and we don't copy the configuration that is passed from CPM to the monitor-running containers. The only shared configuration between them is the one set at the Docker daemon level.",

      "body": "In synthetic monitoring, a private location is a collection of private minions. A minion is a containerized application that receives and manages jobs set up through the Synthetics UI. A private location can contain any number of private minions. Private locations allow you to extend your synthetic monitoring coverage to new geographical locations, and to monitor websites behind your firewall (like an intranet site). What you need To use private locations, first review these requirements and other factors: Compatibility for... Requirements Check budget Checks from a private location count against your budget. Synthetics horde endpoint For US-based accounts: https://synthetics-horde.nr-data.net/ For EU-based accounts: https://synthetics-horde.eu01.nr-data.net/ Outbound network access The minion needs to connect to the synthetic monitoring's horde endpoint to receive and process jobs. If your firewall rules don't permit direct access, you must configure proxy access. Test your connection to the horde endpoint with a successful response from the following command: curl -X GET https://synthetics-horde.nr-data.net/synthetics/api/v1/ping Copy Account access and permissions How access works depends on your user model: Original user model: If a private location is set up by an account with child accounts, it can be used by users with access to those child accounts. But if it's set up on a child account, it can only be used by users in that account. New Relic One user model: user access to an account depends on whether they've been granted access to that account. Create a private location one.newrelic.com > Synthetics > Private Locations: Use the Private Locations page to create, edit, and delete private locations. Before installing private minions, you need to create a private location. To create a new private location: Ensure you meet the requirements, including activating the feature by contacting your account representative. Go to one.newrelic.com > Synthetics > Private locations. Then select Create private location. Tip The Private locations sub menu becomes available after you create your first monitor. Type a location name. Optional: Configure these additional settings: Description: Describe your private location for other account users. Verified script execution: Require a passphrase when assigning scripts to this location, or when adding minions to the location. Select Create. After creating the location, Synthetics lists your Private location key so you can install a private minion. Ping monitor checks Each minion can run about 200 ping monitor checks per minute (about 8,640,000 checks per month). If the job queue for a particular location is growing, add additional minions. The exact capacity of the minions can vary, depending on: Your network performance The complexity of your scripts The hardware configuration for the private minion Add jobs to the location queue To add jobs to the queue for your location, follow standard procedures to add or edit a monitor, and select your location from the Private locations list. To assign an existing monitor, edit that monitor's settings. one.newrelic.com > Synthetics > Create monitor: To assign new jobs to your private location and its minions, select its name from the Create monitor page. Manage private locations Tip If you can't access this feature, check the Factors affecting access to features and data. Synthetic monitoring includes tools to manage locations and individual minions. You can also install new minions, and clear the job queue if it backs up. To access these tools, go to one.newrelic.com > Synthetics > Private locations. Then follow the steps: If you want to... Do this... Clear the job queue Click the icon, and select Clear queue. This is useful when the number of scheduled jobs has increased faster than the minions can process them, such as when the minion is offline. View the status of an individual minion Select the parent location's name from the list. The green health status indicator identifies active minions. You can also view the last reported time for each minion, and check whether the minion software is out of date. Change location or view the private location key Click the icon, and select Edit. Delete a location Click the icon for the location, and select Delete. This does not shut down any minions assigned to that location. The minions must be shut down manually or reassigned. Enable or disable verified script execution Legacy minions: Verified script execution requires that you set up a passphrase on the minion before assigning any scripts to the location. CPM: You need to pass the MINION_VSE_PASSPHRASE variable to the minion. Then, at the Private locations tab, click on Edit and, in the menu, enable the Verified script execution option. Set proxy configuration You can set proxy server configuration for synthetic scripted monitors that run from local private locations. For more information, see Synthetic's proxy settings.",

      "body": "You can use New Relic's containerized private minions (CPM). These are Docker container-based private minions that accept and execute synthetic monitors against your private locations. The CPM can operate in a Docker container system environment or a Kubernetes container orchestration system environment. The CPM will auto-detect its environment to select the appropriate operating mode. General private minion features Because the CPM operates as a container instead of a virtual machine, it delivers many features: Easy to install, start, and update Runs on: Linux macOS Windows Enhanced security and support for non-root user execution Ability to leverage a Docker container as a sandbox environment Customizable monitor check timeout Custom provided modules for scripted monitor types Kubernetes-specific features Also, the CPM delivers the following features in a Kubernetes environment: Integrates with the Kubernetes API to delegate runtime lifecycle management to Kubernetes Does not require privileged access to the Docker socket Supports hosted and on-premise Kubernetes clusters Supports various container engines such as Docker and Containerd Deployable via Helm charts as well as configuration YAMLs Allows job (ping vs. non-ping checks) based resource allocation for optimum resource management Observability offered via the New Relic One Kubernetes cluster explorer System requirements and compatibility To host CPMs, your system must meet the minimum requirements for the chosen system environment. Caution Do not modify any CPM files. New Relic is not liable for any modifications you make. For more information, contact your account representative or a New Relic technical sales rep. Docker container system environment requirements Compatibility for Requirements Operating system Linux kernel: 3.10 or higher macOS: 10.11 or higher Windows: Windows 10 64-bit or higher Processor A modern, multi-core CPU Memory 2.5 GiB of RAM per CPU core (dedicated) Disk space A minimum of 10 GB per host Docker version Docker 17.12.1-ce or higher Private location key You must have a private location key Caution Amazon ECS is not supported. Kubernetes container orchestration system environment requirements (CPM v3.0.0 or higher) Compatibility for Requirements Operating system Linux kernel: 3.10 or higher macOS: 10.11 or higher Windows: Windows 10 64-bit or higher Processor A modern, multi-core CPU Minion pod CPU (vCPU/Core): 0.5 up to 0.75 Memory: 800 Mi up to 1.6 Gi Resources allocated to a Minion pod are user configurable. Runner pod CPU (vCPU/Core): 0.5 up to 1 Memory: 1.25 Gi up to 3 Gi For a scripted API check, 1.25 Gi will be requested with a limit of 2.5 Gi. For a simple browser or scripted browser check, 2 Gi will be requested with a limit of 3 Gi. Additional considerations: Resources allocated to a runner pod are not user configurable. The maximum limit-request resource ratio for both CPU and memory is 2. Disk space Persistent volume (PV) of at least 10 Gi in size Note that if a ReadWriteOnce (RWO) PV is provided to the minion, an implicit node affinity will be established to ensure the minion and the runner containers are scheduled on the same node. This is required to allow the minion and the associated runners access to the PV, as an RWO PV can be accessed only by a single node in the cluster. Kubernetes version We recommend that your Kubernetes cluster supports Kubernetes v1.15. Caution We have identified a compatibility issue with Kubernetes v1.21+. A workaround is available by disabling the BoundServiceAccountTokenVolume feature gate on the cluster. Private location key You must have a private location key Helm Follow installation instructions for Helm v3 for your OS. Kubectl Follow installation instructions for Kubectl for your OS. To view versions, dependencies, default values for how many runner pods start with each minion, the Persistent volume access mode, and more, please see Show help and examples below. Private location key Before launching CPMs, you must have a private location key. Your CPM uses the key to authenticate against New Relic and run monitors associated with that private location. To find the key for existing private location: Go to one.newrelic.com > Synthetics > Private locations. In the Private locations index, locate the private location you want your CPM to be assigned to. Note the key associated with the private location with the key icon. Sandboxing and Docker dependencies Sandboxing and Docker dependencies are applicable to the CPM in a Docker container system environment. Docker dependencies The CPM runs in Docker and is able to leverage Docker as a sandboxing technology. This ensures complete isolation of the monitor execution, which improves security, reliability, and repeatability. Every time a scripted or browser monitor is executed, the CPM creates a brand new Docker container to run it in called a runner. The minion container needs to be configured to communicate with the Docker engine in order to spawn additional runner containers. Each spawned container is then dedicated to run a check associated with the synthetic monitor running on the private location the minion container is associated with. There are two crucial dependencies at launch. To enable sandboxing, ensure that: Your writable and executable directory is mounted at /tmp. The writable directory can be any directory you want the CPM to write into, but New Relic recommends the system's own /tmp to make things easy. Your writable Docker UNIX socket is mounted at /var/run/docker.sock or DOCKER_HOST environment variable. For more information, see Docker's Daemon socket option. Caution Core count on the host determines how many runner containers the CPM can run concurrently on the host. Since memory requirements are scaled to the expected count of runner containers, we recommend not running multiple CPMs on the same host to avoid resource contention. For additional information on sandboxing and running as a root or non-root user, see Security, sandboxing, and running as non-root. Install and update CPM versions Both installing and updating the CPM use the same command to pull the latest Docker image from the Quay.io repository where the CPM Docker image is hosted. Go to quay.io/repository/newrelic/synthetics-minion for a list of all the releases. CPM images are also hosted on Docker Hub. Go to hub.docker.com/r/newrelic/synthetics-minion/tags for a list of all the releases. Start the CPM To start the CPM, follow the applicable Docker or Kubernetes instructions. Docker start procedure Locate your private location key. Ensure you've enabled Docker dependencies for sandboxing and installed CPM on your system. Run the appropriate script for your system. Tailor the common defaults for /tmp and /var/run/docker.sock in the following examples to match your system. Linux/macOS: docker run \\ --name YOUR_CONTAINER_NAME \\ -e \"MINION_PRIVATE_LOCATION_KEY=YOUR_PRIVATE_LOCATION_KEY\" \\ -v /tmp:/tmp:rw \\ -v /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock:rw \\ -d \\ --restart unless-stopped \\ quay.io/newrelic/synthetics-minion:latest Copy Windows: docker run ^ --name YOUR_CONTAINER_NAME ^ -e \"MINION_PRIVATE_LOCATION_KEY=YOUR_PRIVATE_LOCATION_KEY\" ^ -v /tmp:/tmp:rw ^ -v /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock:rw ^ -d ^ --restart unless-stopped ^ quay.io/newrelic/synthetics-minion:latest Copy View the logs for your minion container: docker logs --follow YOUR_CONTAINER_NAME Copy When a message similar to Synthetics Minion is ready and servicing location YOUR_PRIVATE_LOCATION_LABEL appears, your CPM is up and ready to run monitors assigned to that location. Kubernetes start procedure Locate your private location key. Set up the a namespace for the CPM in your Kubernetes cluster: kubectl create namespace YOUR_NAMESPACE Copy Copy the Helm charts from the New Relic Helm repo. If you are copying the charts for the first time: helm repo add YOUR_REPO_NAME https://helm-charts.newrelic.com Copy If you previously copied the Helm charts from the New Relic Helm repo, then get the latest: helm repo update Copy Install the CPM with the following Helm command: For a fresh installation of the CPM: helm install YOUR_CPM_NAME YOUR_REPO_NAME/synthetics-minion -n YOUR_NAMESPACE --set synthetics.privateLocationKey=YOUR_PRIVATE_LOCATION_KEY Copy To update an existing CPM installation: helm upgrade YOUR_CPM_NAME YOUR_REPO_NAME/synthetics-minion -n YOUR_NAMESPACE --set synthetics.privateLocationKey=YOUR_PRIVATE_LOCATION_KEY Copy Check if the minion pod is up and running: kubectl get -n YOUR_NAMESPACE pods Copy Once the status attribute of each pod is shown as running, your CPM is up and ready to run monitors assigned to your private location. Stop or delete the CPM On a Docker container system environment, use the Docker stop procedure to stop the CPM from running. On a Kubernetes container orchestration system environment, use the Kubernetes delete procedure to stop the CPM from running. Docker stop procedure You can stop a Docker container either by the container name, or the container ID. Container name stop for Linux, macOS, and Windows: docker stop YOUR_CONTAINER_NAME docker rm YOUR_CONTAINER_NAME Copy Container ID stop for Linux/macOS: In the examples the container is stopped and removed. To only stop the container, omit docker rm $CONTAINER_ID. CONTAINER_ID=$(docker ps -aqf name=YOUR_CONTAINER_NAME) docker stop $CONTAINER_ID docker rm $CONTAINER_ID Copy Container ID stop for Windows: In the examples the container is stopped and removed. To only stop the container, omit docker rm $CONTAINER_ID. FOR /F \"tokens=*\" %%CID IN ('docker ps -aqf name=YOUR_CONTAINER_NAME') do (SET CONTAINER_ID=%%CID) docker stop %CONTAINER_ID% docker rm %CONTAINER_ID% Copy Kubernetes delete procedure Get the MINION_POD_INSTALLATION_NAME of the minion pod you want to delete: helm list -n YOUR_NAMESPACE Copy Delete the minion pod: helm uninstall -n YOUR_NAMESPACE MINION_POD_INSTALLATION_NAME Copy Delete the namespace set up for the CPM in your Kubernetes cluster: kubectl delete namespace YOUR_NAMESPACE Copy Show help and examples Use these options as applicable: To get a list of the most commonly used run options directly in the command line interface, run the show help command. To show CPM usage examples as well as the list of all the available run options, run this command: docker run quay.io/newrelic/synthetics-minion:latest help Copy To keep track of Docker logs and verify the health of your monitors, see Containerized private minion (CPM) maintenance and monitoring. For a CPM in the Kubernetes container orchestration system environment, the following Helm show commands can be used to view the chart.yaml and the values.yaml, respectively: helm show chart YOUR_REPO_NAME/synthetics-minion Copy helm show values YOUR_REPO_NAME/synthetics-minion Copy Show license information To show the licensing information for the open source software that we use in the CPM, run the LICENSE command. Run this command to view license information for CPM versions 2.2.27 or higher: docker run quay.io/newrelic/synthetics-minion:latest LICENSE Copy Some of our open-source software is listed under multiple software licenses, and in that case we have listed the license we've chosen to use. Our license information is also available in the our licenses documentation. Configure CPM You can configure the containerized private minion with custom npm modules, preserve data between launches, use environment variables, and more. For more information, see CPM configuration. Networks For both Docker and Kubernetes, the CPM and its runner containers will inherit network settings from the host. For an example of this on a Docker container system environment, see the Docker site. A new bridge network is created for each runner container. This means networking command options like --network and --dns passed to the CPM container at launch (such as through Docker run commands on a Docker container system environment) are not inherited or used by the runner containers. When these networks are created, they pull from the default IP address pool configured for daemon. For an example of this on a Docker container system environment, see the Docker site. Typically, the runner network is removed after the check is completed. However, if a CPM exits while a check is still running, or exits in another unexpected circumstance, these networks may get orphaned. This can potentially use up IP address space that is available to the Docker daemon. If this happens, you may see INTERNAL ENGINE ERROR code: 31 entries in your CPM logging when trying to create a new runner container. To clean these up in Docker container system environments only, run docker network prune. Security, sandboxing, and running as non-root By default, the software running inside a CPM is executed with root user privileges. This is suitable for most scenarios, as the execution is sandboxed. In a Docker container system environment: To change the default AppArmor profile used by containers that CPM spawns to run monitors, see the environment variable MINION_RUNNER_APPARMOR (CPM version 3.0.3 or higher) or MINION_DOCKER_RUNNER_APPARMOR (CPM version up to v3.0.2). To run the CPM as a non-root user, additional steps are required: Run as non-root user for Docker For more information, see Docker's official documentation about security and AppArmor security profiles. If your environment requires you to run the CPM as a non-root user, follow this procedure. In the following example, the non-root user is my_user. Ensure that my_user can use the Docker engine on the host: Verify that my_user belongs to the \"docker\" system group. OR Enable the Docker TCP socket option, and pass the DOCKER_HOST environment variable to CPM. Verify that my_user has read/write permissions to all the directories and volumes passed to CPM. To set these permission, use the chmod command. Get the uid of my_user for use in the run command: id -u my_user. Once these conditions are met, use the option \"-u <uid>:<gid>\" when launching CPM: docker run ... -u 1002 ... Copy OR docker run ... -u 1002 -e DOCKER_HOST=http://localhost:2375 ... Copy Docker image repository A single CPM Docker image serves both the Docker container system environment and Kubernetes container orchestration system environment. The Docker image is hosted on quay.io. To make sure your Docker image is up-to-date, see the quay.io newrelic/synthetics-minion repository. Additional considerations for CPM connection Connection Description CPMs without Internet access A CPM can operate without access to the internet, but with some exceptions. The public internet health check can be disabled using the environment variables named MINION_NETWORK_HEALTHCHECK_DISABLED for a Docker container system environment or synthetics.minionNetworkHealthCheckDisabled for a Kubernetes container orchestration system environment. The CPM needs to be able to contact the \"synthetics-horde.nr-data.net\" domain. This is necessary for it to report data to New Relic and to receive monitors to execute. Ask your network administration if this is a problem and how to set up exceptions. Communicate with Synthetics via a proxy To set up communication with New Relic by proxy, use the environment variables named MINION_API_PROXY*. Arguments passed at launch This applies to a Docker container environment only. Arguments passed to the CPM container at launch do not get passed on to the containers spawned by the CPM. Docker has no concept of \"inheritance\" or a \"hierarchy\" of containers, and we don't copy the configuration that is passed from CPM to the monitor-running containers. The only shared configuration between them is the one set at the Docker daemon level.",

      "body": "You can use New Relic's containerized private minions (CPM). These are Docker container-based private minions that accept and execute synthetic monitors against your private locations. The CPM can operate in a Docker container system environment or a Kubernetes container orchestration system environment. The CPM will auto-detect its environment to select the appropriate operating mode. General private minion features Because the CPM operates as a container instead of a virtual machine, it delivers many features: Easy to install, start, and update Runs on: Linux macOS Windows Enhanced security and support for non-root user execution Ability to leverage a Docker container as a sandbox environment Customizable monitor check timeout Custom provided modules for scripted monitor types Kubernetes-specific features Also, the CPM delivers the following features in a Kubernetes environment: Integrates with the Kubernetes API to delegate runtime lifecycle management to Kubernetes Does not require privileged access to the Docker socket Supports hosted and on-premise Kubernetes clusters Supports various container engines such as Docker and Containerd Deployable via Helm charts as well as configuration YAMLs Allows job (ping vs. non-ping checks) based resource allocation for optimum resource management Observability offered via the New Relic One Kubernetes cluster explorer System requirements and compatibility To host CPMs, your system must meet the minimum requirements for the chosen system environment. Caution Do not modify any CPM files. New Relic is not liable for any modifications you make. For more information, contact your account representative or a New Relic technical sales rep. Docker container system environment requirements Compatibility for Requirements Operating system Linux kernel: 3.10 or higher macOS: 10.11 or higher Windows: Windows 10 64-bit or higher Processor A modern, multi-core CPU Memory 2.5 GiB of RAM per CPU core (dedicated) Disk space A minimum of 10 GB per host Docker version Docker 17.12.1-ce or higher Private location key You must have a private location key Caution Amazon ECS is not supported. Kubernetes container orchestration system environment requirements (CPM v3.0.0 or higher) Compatibility for Requirements Operating system Linux kernel: 3.10 or higher macOS: 10.11 or higher Windows: Windows 10 64-bit or higher Processor A modern, multi-core CPU Minion pod CPU (vCPU/Core): 0.5 up to 0.75 Memory: 800 Mi up to 1.6 Gi Resources allocated to a Minion pod are user configurable. Runner pod CPU (vCPU/Core): 0.5 up to 1 Memory: 1.25 Gi up to 3 Gi For a scripted API check, 1.25 Gi will be requested with a limit of 2.5 Gi. For a simple browser or scripted browser check, 2 Gi will be requested with a limit of 3 Gi. Additional considerations: Resources allocated to a runner pod are not user configurable. The maximum limit-request resource ratio for both CPU and memory is 2. Disk space Persistent volume (PV) of at least 10 Gi in size Note that if a ReadWriteOnce (RWO) PV is provided to the minion, an implicit node affinity will be established to ensure the minion and the runner containers are scheduled on the same node. This is required to allow the minion and the associated runners access to the PV, as an RWO PV can be accessed only by a single node in the cluster. Kubernetes version We recommend that your Kubernetes cluster supports Kubernetes v1.15. Caution We have identified a compatibility issue with Kubernetes v1.21+. A workaround is available by disabling the BoundServiceAccountTokenVolume feature gate on the cluster. Private location key You must have a private location key Helm Follow installation instructions for Helm v3 for your OS. Kubectl Follow installation instructions for Kubectl for your OS. To view versions, dependencies, default values for how many runner pods start with each minion, the Persistent volume access mode, and more, please see Show help and examples below. Private location key Before launching CPMs, you must have a private location key. Your CPM uses the key to authenticate against New Relic and run monitors associated with that private location. To find the key for existing private location: Go to one.newrelic.com > Synthetics > Private locations. In the Private locations index, locate the private location you want your CPM to be assigned to. Note the key associated with the private location with the key icon. Sandboxing and Docker dependencies Sandboxing and Docker dependencies are applicable to the CPM in a Docker container system environment. Docker dependencies The CPM runs in Docker and is able to leverage Docker as a sandboxing technology. This ensures complete isolation of the monitor execution, which improves security, reliability, and repeatability. Every time a scripted or browser monitor is executed, the CPM creates a brand new Docker container to run it in called a runner. The minion container needs to be configured to communicate with the Docker engine in order to spawn additional runner containers. Each spawned container is then dedicated to run a check associated with the synthetic monitor running on the private location the minion container is associated with. There are two crucial dependencies at launch. To enable sandboxing, ensure that: Your writable and executable directory is mounted at /tmp. The writable directory can be any directory you want the CPM to write into, but New Relic recommends the system's own /tmp to make things easy. Your writable Docker UNIX socket is mounted at /var/run/docker.sock or DOCKER_HOST environment variable. For more information, see Docker's Daemon socket option. Caution Core count on the host determines how many runner containers the CPM can run concurrently on the host. Since memory requirements are scaled to the expected count of runner containers, we recommend not running multiple CPMs on the same host to avoid resource contention. For additional information on sandboxing and running as a root or non-root user, see Security, sandboxing, and running as non-root. Install and update CPM versions Both installing and updating the CPM use the same command to pull the latest Docker image from the Quay.io repository where the CPM Docker image is hosted. Go to quay.io/repository/newrelic/synthetics-minion for a list of all the releases. CPM images are also hosted on Docker Hub. Go to hub.docker.com/r/newrelic/synthetics-minion/tags for a list of all the releases. Start the CPM To start the CPM, follow the applicable Docker or Kubernetes instructions. Docker start procedure Locate your private location key. Ensure you've enabled Docker dependencies for sandboxing and installed CPM on your system. Run the appropriate script for your system. Tailor the common defaults for /tmp and /var/run/docker.sock in the following examples to match your system. Linux/macOS: docker run \\ --name YOUR_CONTAINER_NAME \\ -e \"MINION_PRIVATE_LOCATION_KEY=YOUR_PRIVATE_LOCATION_KEY\" \\ -v /tmp:/tmp:rw \\ -v /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock:rw \\ -d \\ --restart unless-stopped \\ quay.io/newrelic/synthetics-minion:latest Copy Windows: docker run ^ --name YOUR_CONTAINER_NAME ^ -e \"MINION_PRIVATE_LOCATION_KEY=YOUR_PRIVATE_LOCATION_KEY\" ^ -v /tmp:/tmp:rw ^ -v /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock:rw ^ -d ^ --restart unless-stopped ^ quay.io/newrelic/synthetics-minion:latest Copy View the logs for your minion container: docker logs --follow YOUR_CONTAINER_NAME Copy When a message similar to Synthetics Minion is ready and servicing location YOUR_PRIVATE_LOCATION_LABEL appears, your CPM is up and ready to run monitors assigned to that location. Kubernetes start procedure Locate your private location key. Set up the a namespace for the CPM in your Kubernetes cluster: kubectl create namespace YOUR_NAMESPACE Copy Copy the Helm charts from the New Relic Helm repo. If you are copying the charts for the first time: helm repo add YOUR_REPO_NAME https://helm-charts.newrelic.com Copy If you previously copied the Helm charts from the New Relic Helm repo, then get the latest: helm repo update Copy Install the CPM with the following Helm command: For a fresh installation of the CPM: helm install YOUR_CPM_NAME YOUR_REPO_NAME/synthetics-minion -n YOUR_NAMESPACE --set synthetics.privateLocationKey=YOUR_PRIVATE_LOCATION_KEY Copy To update an existing CPM installation: helm upgrade YOUR_CPM_NAME YOUR_REPO_NAME/synthetics-minion -n YOUR_NAMESPACE --set synthetics.privateLocationKey=YOUR_PRIVATE_LOCATION_KEY Copy Check if the minion pod is up and running: kubectl get -n YOUR_NAMESPACE pods Copy Once the status attribute of each pod is shown as running, your CPM is up and ready to run monitors assigned to your private location. Stop or delete the CPM On a Docker container system environment, use the Docker stop procedure to stop the CPM from running. On a Kubernetes container orchestration system environment, use the Kubernetes delete procedure to stop the CPM from running. Docker stop procedure You can stop a Docker container either by the container name, or the container ID. Container name stop for Linux, macOS, and Windows: docker stop YOUR_CONTAINER_NAME docker rm YOUR_CONTAINER_NAME Copy Container ID stop for Linux/macOS: In the examples the container is stopped and removed. To only stop the container, omit docker rm $CONTAINER_ID. CONTAINER_ID=$(docker ps -aqf name=YOUR_CONTAINER_NAME) docker stop $CONTAINER_ID docker rm $CONTAINER_ID Copy Container ID stop for Windows: In the examples the container is stopped and removed. To only stop the container, omit docker rm $CONTAINER_ID. FOR /F \"tokens=*\" %%CID IN ('docker ps -aqf name=YOUR_CONTAINER_NAME') do (SET CONTAINER_ID=%%CID) docker stop %CONTAINER_ID% docker rm %CONTAINER_ID% Copy Kubernetes delete procedure Get the MINION_POD_INSTALLATION_NAME of the minion pod you want to delete: helm list -n YOUR_NAMESPACE Copy Delete the minion pod: helm uninstall -n YOUR_NAMESPACE MINION_POD_INSTALLATION_NAME Copy Delete the namespace set up for the CPM in your Kubernetes cluster: kubectl delete namespace YOUR_NAMESPACE Copy Show help and examples Use these options as applicable: To get a list of the most commonly used run options directly in the command line interface, run the show help command. To show CPM usage examples as well as the list of all the available run options, run this command: docker run quay.io/newrelic/synthetics-minion:latest help Copy To keep track of Docker logs and verify the health of your monitors, see Containerized private minion (CPM) maintenance and monitoring. For a CPM in the Kubernetes container orchestration system environment, the following Helm show commands can be used to view the chart.yaml and the values.yaml, respectively: helm show chart YOUR_REPO_NAME/synthetics-minion Copy helm show values YOUR_REPO_NAME/synthetics-minion Copy Show license information To show the licensing information for the open source software that we use in the CPM, run the LICENSE command. Run this command to view license information for CPM versions 2.2.27 or higher: docker run quay.io/newrelic/synthetics-minion:latest LICENSE Copy Some of our open-source software is listed under multiple software licenses, and in that case we have listed the license we've chosen to use. Our license information is also available in the our licenses documentation. Configure CPM You can configure the containerized private minion with custom npm modules, preserve data between launches, use environment variables, and more. For more information, see CPM configuration. Networks For both Docker and Kubernetes, the CPM and its runner containers will inherit network settings from the host. For an example of this on a Docker container system environment, see the Docker site. A new bridge network is created for each runner container. This means networking command options like --network and --dns passed to the CPM container at launch (such as through Docker run commands on a Docker container system environment) are not inherited or used by the runner containers. When these networks are created, they pull from the default IP address pool configured for daemon. For an example of this on a Docker container system environment, see the Docker site. Typically, the runner network is removed after the check is completed. However, if a CPM exits while a check is still running, or exits in another unexpected circumstance, these networks may get orphaned. This can potentially use up IP address space that is available to the Docker daemon. If this happens, you may see INTERNAL ENGINE ERROR code: 31 entries in your CPM logging when trying to create a new runner container. To clean these up in Docker container system environments only, run docker network prune. Security, sandboxing, and running as non-root By default, the software running inside a CPM is executed with root user privileges. This is suitable for most scenarios, as the execution is sandboxed. In a Docker container system environment: To change the default AppArmor profile used by containers that CPM spawns to run monitors, see the environment variable MINION_RUNNER_APPARMOR (CPM version 3.0.3 or higher) or MINION_DOCKER_RUNNER_APPARMOR (CPM version up to v3.0.2). To run the CPM as a non-root user, additional steps are required: Run as non-root user for Docker For more information, see Docker's official documentation about security and AppArmor security profiles. If your environment requires you to run the CPM as a non-root user, follow this procedure. In the following example, the non-root user is my_user. Ensure that my_user can use the Docker engine on the host: Verify that my_user belongs to the \"docker\" system group. OR Enable the Docker TCP socket option, and pass the DOCKER_HOST environment variable to CPM. Verify that my_user has read/write permissions to all the directories and volumes passed to CPM. To set these permission, use the chmod command. Get the uid of my_user for use in the run command: id -u my_user. Once these conditions are met, use the option \"-u <uid>:<gid>\" when launching CPM: docker run ... -u 1002 ... Copy OR docker run ... -u 1002 -e DOCKER_HOST=http://localhost:2375 ... Copy Docker image repository A single CPM Docker image serves both the Docker container system environment and Kubernetes container orchestration system environment. The Docker image is hosted on quay.io. To make sure your Docker image is up-to-date, see the quay.io newrelic/synthetics-minion repository. Additional considerations for CPM connection Connection Description CPMs without Internet access A CPM can operate without access to the internet, but with some exceptions. The public internet health check can be disabled using the environment variables named MINION_NETWORK_HEALTHCHECK_DISABLED for a Docker container system environment or synthetics.minionNetworkHealthCheckDisabled for a Kubernetes container orchestration system environment. The CPM needs to be able to contact the \"synthetics-horde.nr-data.net\" domain. This is necessary for it to report data to New Relic and to receive monitors to execute. Ask your network administration if this is a problem and how to set up exceptions. Communicate with Synthetics via a proxy To set up communication with New Relic by proxy, use the environment variables named MINION_API_PROXY*. Arguments passed at launch This applies to a Docker container environment only. Arguments passed to the CPM container at launch do not get passed on to the containers spawned by the CPM. Docker has no concept of \"inheritance\" or a \"hierarchy\" of containers, and we don't copy the configuration that is passed from CPM to the monitor-running containers. The only shared configuration between them is the one set at the Docker daemon level.",

      "body": "In synthetic monitoring, a private location is a collection of private minions. A minion is a containerized application that receives and manages jobs set up through the Synthetics UI. A private location can contain any number of private minions. Private locations allow you to extend your synthetic monitoring coverage to new geographical locations, and to monitor websites behind your firewall (like an intranet site). What you need To use private locations, first review these requirements and other factors: Compatibility for... Requirements Check budget Checks from a private location count against your budget. Synthetics horde endpoint For US-based accounts: https://synthetics-horde.nr-data.net/ For EU-based accounts: https://synthetics-horde.eu01.nr-data.net/ Outbound network access The minion needs to connect to the synthetic monitoring's horde endpoint to receive and process jobs. If your firewall rules don't permit direct access, you must configure proxy access. Test your connection to the horde endpoint with a successful response from the following command: curl -X GET https://synthetics-horde.nr-data.net/synthetics/api/v1/ping Copy Account access and permissions How access works depends on your user model: Original user model: If a private location is set up by an account with child accounts, it can be used by users with access to those child accounts. But if it's set up on a child account, it can only be used by users in that account. New Relic One user model: user access to an account depends on whether they've been granted access to that account. Create a private location one.newrelic.com > Synthetics > Private Locations: Use the Private Locations page to create, edit, and delete private locations. Before installing private minions, you need to create a private location. To create a new private location: Ensure you meet the requirements, including activating the feature by contacting your account representative. Go to one.newrelic.com > Synthetics > Private locations. Then select Create private location. Tip The Private locations sub menu becomes available after you create your first monitor. Type a location name. Optional: Configure these additional settings: Description: Describe your private location for other account users. Verified script execution: Require a passphrase when assigning scripts to this location, or when adding minions to the location. Select Create. After creating the location, Synthetics lists your Private location key so you can install a private minion. Ping monitor checks Each minion can run about 200 ping monitor checks per minute (about 8,640,000 checks per month). If the job queue for a particular location is growing, add additional minions. The exact capacity of the minions can vary, depending on: Your network performance The complexity of your scripts The hardware configuration for the private minion Add jobs to the location queue To add jobs to the queue for your location, follow standard procedures to add or edit a monitor, and select your location from the Private locations list. To assign an existing monitor, edit that monitor's settings. one.newrelic.com > Synthetics > Create monitor: To assign new jobs to your private location and its minions, select its name from the Create monitor page. Manage private locations Tip If you can't access this feature, check the Factors affecting access to features and data. Synthetic monitoring includes tools to manage locations and individual minions. You can also install new minions, and clear the job queue if it backs up. To access these tools, go to one.newrelic.com > Synthetics > Private locations. Then follow the steps: If you want to... Do this... Clear the job queue Click the icon, and select Clear queue. This is useful when the number of scheduled jobs has increased faster than the minions can process them, such as when the minion is offline. View the status of an individual minion Select the parent location's name from the list. The green health status indicator identifies active minions. You can also view the last reported time for each minion, and check whether the minion software is out of date. Change location or view the private location key Click the icon, and select Edit. Delete a location Click the icon for the location, and select Delete. This does not shut down any minions assigned to that location. The minions must be shut down manually or reassigned. Enable or disable verified script execution Legacy minions: Verified script execution requires that you set up a passphrase on the minion before assigning any scripts to the location. CPM: You need to pass the MINION_VSE_PASSPHRASE variable to the minion. Then, at the Private locations tab, click on Edit and, in the menu, enable the Verified script execution option. Set proxy configuration You can set proxy server configuration for synthetic scripted monitors that run from local private locations. For more information, see Synthetic's proxy settings.",

The CPM can operate in a Docker container system environment or a Kubernetes container orchestration system environment. The CPM will auto-detect its environment to select the appropriate operating mode. General private minion features Because the CPM operates as a container instead of a virtual machine, it delivers many features: Easy to install, start, and update Runs on: Linux macOS Windows Enhanced security and support for non-root user execution Ability to leverage a Docker container as a sandbox environment Customizable monitor check timeout Custom provided modules for scripted monitor types Kubernetes-specific features Also, the CPM delivers the following features in a Kubernetes environment: Integrates with the Kubernetes API to delegate runtime lifecycle management to Kubernetes Does not require privileged access to the Docker socket Supports hosted and on-premise Kubernetes clusters Supports various container engines such as Docker and Containerd Deployable via Helm charts as well as configuration YAMLs Allows job (ping vs. non-ping checks) based resource allocation for optimum resource management Observability offered via the New Relic One Kubernetes cluster explorer System requirements and compatibility To host CPMs, your system must meet the minimum requirements for the chosen system environment. Caution Do not modify any CPM files. New Relic is not liable for any modifications you make. For more information, contact your account representative or a New Relic technical sales rep. Docker container system environment requirements Compatibility for Requirements Operating system Linux kernel: 3.10 or higher macOS: 10.11 or higher Windows: Windows 10 64-bit or higher Processor A modern, multi-core CPU Memory 2.5 GiB of RAM per CPU core (dedicated) Disk space A minimum of 10 GB per host Docker version Docker 17.12.1-ce or higher Private location key You must have a private location key Caution Amazon ECS is not supported. Kubernetes container orchestration system environment requirements (CPM v3.0.0 or higher) Compatibility for Requirements Operating system Linux kernel: 3.10 or higher macOS: 10.11 or higher Windows: Windows 10 64-bit or higher Processor A modern, multi-core CPU Minion pod CPU (vCPU/Core): 0.5 up to 0.75 Memory: 800 Mi up to 1.6 Gi Resources allocated to a Minion pod are user configurable. Runner pod CPU (vCPU/Core): 0.5 up to 1 Memory: 1.25 Gi up to 3 Gi For a scripted API check, 1.25 Gi will be requested with a limit of 2.5 Gi. For a simple browser or scripted browser check, 2 Gi will be requested with a limit of 3 Gi. Additional considerations: Resources allocated to a runner pod are not user configurable. The maximum limit-request resource ratio for both CPU and memory is 2. Disk space Persistent volume (PV) of at least 10 Gi in size Note that if a ReadWriteOnce (RWO) PV is provided to the minion, an implicit node affinity will be established to ensure the minion and the runner containers are scheduled on the same node. This is required to allow the minion and the associated runners access to the PV, as an RWO PV can be accessed only by a single node in the cluster. Kubernetes version We recommend that your Kubernetes cluster supports Kubernetes v1.15. Caution We have identified a compatibility issue with Kubernetes v1.21+. A workaround is available by disabling the BoundServiceAccountTokenVolume feature gate on the cluster. Private location key You must have a private location key Helm Follow installation instructions for Helm v3 for your OS. Kubectl Follow installation instructions for Kubectl for your OS. To view versions, dependencies, default values for how many runner pods start with each minion, the Persistent volume access mode, and more, please see Show help and examples below. Private location key Before launching CPMs, you must have a private location key. Your CPM uses the key to authenticate against New Relic and run monitors associated with that private location. To find the key for existing private location: Go to one.newrelic.com > Synthetics > Private locations. In the Private locations index, locate the private location you want your CPM to be assigned to. Note the key associated with the private location with the key icon. Sandboxing and Docker dependencies Sandboxing and Docker dependencies are applicable to the CPM in a Docker container system environment. Docker dependencies The CPM runs in Docker and is able to leverage Docker as a sandboxing technology. This ensures complete isolation of the monitor execution, which improves security, reliability, and repeatability. Every time a scripted or browser monitor is executed, the CPM creates a brand new Docker container to run it in called a runner. The minion container needs to be configured to communicate with the Docker engine in order to spawn additional runner containers. Each spawned container is then dedicated to run a check associated with the synthetic monitor running on the private location the minion container is associated with. There are two crucial dependencies at launch. To enable sandboxing, ensure that: Your writable and executable directory is mounted at /tmp. The writable directory can be any directory you want the CPM to write into, but New Relic recommends the system's own /tmp to make things easy. Your writable Docker UNIX socket is mounted at /var/run/docker.sock or DOCKER_HOST environment variable. For more information, see Docker's Daemon socket option. Caution Core count on the host determines how many runner containers the CPM can run concurrently on the host. Since memory requirements are scaled to the expected count of runner containers, we recommend not running multiple CPMs on the same host to avoid resource contention. For additional information on sandboxing and running as a root or non-root user, see Security, sandboxing, and running as non-root. Install and update CPM versions Both installing and updating the CPM use the same command to pull the latest Docker image from the Quay.io repository where the CPM Docker image is hosted. Go to quay.io/repository/newrelic/synthetics-minion for a list of all the releases. CPM images are also hosted on Docker Hub. Go to hub.docker.com/r/newrelic/synthetics-minion/tags for a list of all the releases. Start the CPM To start the CPM, follow the applicable Docker or Kubernetes instructions. Docker start procedure Locate your private location key. Ensure you've enabled Docker dependencies for sandboxing and installed CPM on your system. Run the appropriate script for your system. Tailor the common defaults for /tmp and /var/run/docker.sock in the following examples to match your system. Linux/macOS: docker run \\ --name YOUR_CONTAINER_NAME \\ -e \"MINION_PRIVATE_LOCATION_KEY=YOUR_PRIVATE_LOCATION_KEY\" \\ -v /tmp:/tmp:rw \\ -v /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock:rw \\ -d \\ --restart unless-stopped \\ quay.io/newrelic/synthetics-minion:latest Copy Windows: docker run ^ --name YOUR_CONTAINER_NAME ^ -e \"MINION_PRIVATE_LOCATION_KEY=YOUR_PRIVATE_LOCATION_KEY\" ^ -v /tmp:/tmp:rw ^ -v /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock:rw ^ -d ^ --restart unless-stopped ^ quay.io/newrelic/synthetics-minion:latest Copy View the logs for your minion container: docker logs --follow YOUR_CONTAINER_NAME Copy When a message similar to Synthetics Minion is ready and servicing location YOUR_PRIVATE_LOCATION_LABEL appears, your CPM is up and ready to run monitors assigned to that location. Kubernetes start procedure Locate your private location key. Set up the a namespace for the CPM in your Kubernetes cluster: kubectl create namespace YOUR_NAMESPACE Copy Copy the Helm charts from the New Relic Helm repo. If you are copying the charts for the first time: helm repo add YOUR_REPO_NAME https://helm-charts.newrelic.com Copy If you previously copied the Helm charts from the New Relic Helm repo, then get the latest: helm repo update Copy Install the CPM with the following Helm command: For a fresh installation of the CPM: helm install YOUR_CPM_NAME YOUR_REPO_NAME/synthetics-minion -n YOUR_NAMESPACE --set synthetics.privateLocationKey=YOUR_PRIVATE_LOCATION_KEY Copy To update an existing CPM installation: helm upgrade YOUR_CPM_NAME YOUR_REPO_NAME/synthetics-minion -n YOUR_NAMESPACE --set synthetics.privateLocationKey=YOUR_PRIVATE_LOCATION_KEY Copy Check if the minion pod is up and running: kubectl get -n YOUR_NAMESPACE pods Copy Once the status attribute of each pod is shown as running, your CPM is up and ready to run monitors assigned to your private location. Stop or delete the CPM On a Docker container system environment, use the Docker stop procedure to stop the CPM from running. On a Kubernetes container orchestration system environment, use the Kubernetes delete procedure to stop the CPM from running. Docker stop procedure You can stop a Docker container either by the container name, or the container ID. Container name stop for Linux, macOS, and Windows: docker stop YOUR_CONTAINER_NAME docker rm YOUR_CONTAINER_NAME Copy Container ID stop for Linux/macOS: In the examples the container is stopped and removed. To only stop the container, omit docker rm $CONTAINER_ID. CONTAINER_ID=$(docker ps -aqf name=YOUR_CONTAINER_NAME) docker stop $CONTAINER_ID docker rm $CONTAINER_ID Copy Container ID stop for Windows: In the examples the container is stopped and removed. To only stop the container, omit docker rm $CONTAINER_ID. FOR /F \"tokens=*\" %%CID IN ('docker ps -aqf name=YOUR_CONTAINER_NAME') do (SET CONTAINER_ID=%%CID) docker stop %CONTAINER_ID% docker rm %CONTAINER_ID% Copy Kubernetes delete procedure Get the MINION_POD_INSTALLATION_NAME of the minion pod you want to delete: helm list -n YOUR_NAMESPACE Copy Delete the minion pod: helm uninstall -n YOUR_NAMESPACE MINION_POD_INSTALLATION_NAME Copy Delete the namespace set up for the CPM in your Kubernetes cluster: kubectl delete namespace YOUR_NAMESPACE Copy Show help and examples Use these options as applicable: To get a list of the most commonly used run options directly in the command line interface, run the show help command. To show CPM usage examples as well as the list of all the available run options, run this command: docker run quay.io/newrelic/synthetics-minion:latest help Copy To keep track of Docker logs and verify the health of your monitors, see Containerized private minion (CPM) maintenance and monitoring. For a CPM in the Kubernetes container orchestration system environment, the following Helm show commands can be used to view the chart.yaml and the values.yaml, respectively: helm show chart YOUR_REPO_NAME/synthetics-minion Copy helm show values YOUR_REPO_NAME/synthetics-minion Copy Show license information To show the licensing information for the open source software that we use in the CPM, run the LICENSE command. Run this command to view license information for CPM versions 2.2.27 or higher: docker run quay.io/newrelic/synthetics-minion:latest LICENSE Copy Some of our open-source software is listed under multiple software licenses, and in that case we have listed the license we've chosen to use. Our license information is also available in the our licenses documentation. Configure CPM You can configure the containerized private minion with custom npm modules, preserve data between launches, use environment variables, and more. For more information, see CPM configuration. Networks For both Docker and Kubernetes, the CPM and its runner containers will inherit network settings from the host. For an example of this on a Docker container system environment, see the Docker site. A new bridge network is created for each runner container. This means networking command options like --network and --dns passed to the CPM container at launch (such as through Docker run commands on a Docker container system environment) are not inherited or used by the runner containers. When these networks are created, they pull from the default IP address pool configured for daemon. For an example of this on a Docker container system environment, see the Docker site. Typically, the runner network is removed after the check is completed. However, if a CPM exits while a check is still running, or exits in another unexpected circumstance, these networks may get orphaned. This can potentially use up IP address space that is available to the Docker daemon. If this happens, you may see INTERNAL ENGINE ERROR code: 31 entries in your CPM logging when trying to create a new runner container. To clean these up in Docker container system environments only, run docker network prune. Security, sandboxing, and running as non-root By default, the software running inside a CPM is executed with root user privileges. This is suitable for most scenarios, as the execution is sandboxed. In a Docker container system environment: To change the default AppArmor profile used by containers that CPM spawns to run monitors, see the environment variable MINION_RUNNER_APPARMOR (CPM version 3.0.3 or higher) or MINION_DOCKER_RUNNER_APPARMOR (CPM version up to v3.0.2). To run the CPM as a non-root user, additional steps are required: Run as non-root user for Docker For more information, see Docker's official documentation about security and AppArmor security profiles. If your environment requires you to run the CPM as a non-root user, follow this procedure. In the following example, the non-root user is my_user. Ensure that my_user can use the Docker engine on the host: Verify that my_user belongs to the \"docker\" system group. OR Enable the Docker TCP socket option, and pass the DOCKER_HOST environment variable to CPM. Verify that my_user has read/write permissions to all the directories and volumes passed to CPM. To set these permission, use the chmod command. Get the uid of my_user for use in the run command: id -u my_user. Once these conditions are met, use the option \"-u <uid>:<gid>\" when launching CPM: docker run ... -u 1002 ... Copy OR docker run ... -u 1002 -e DOCKER_HOST=http://localhost:2375 ... Copy Docker image repository A single CPM Docker image serves both the Docker container system environment and Kubernetes container orchestration system environment. The Docker image is hosted on quay.io. To make sure your Docker image is up-to-date, see the quay.io newrelic/synthetics-minion repository. Additional considerations for CPM connection Connection Description CPMs without Internet access A CPM can operate without access to the internet, but with some exceptions. The public internet health check can be disabled using the environment variables named MINION_NETWORK_HEALTHCHECK_DISABLED for a Docker container system environment or synthetics.minionNetworkHealthCheckDisabled for a Kubernetes container orchestration system environment. The CPM needs to be able to contact the \"synthetics-horde.nr-data.net\" domain. This is necessary for it to report data to New Relic and to receive monitors to execute. Ask your network administration if this is a problem and how to set up exceptions. Communicate with Synthetics via a proxy To set up communication with New Relic by proxy, use the environment variables named MINION_API_PROXY*. Arguments passed at launch This applies to a Docker container environment only. Arguments passed to the CPM container at launch do not get passed on to the containers spawned by the CPM. Docker has no concept of \"inheritance\" or a \"hierarchy\" of containers, and we don't copy the configuration that is passed from CPM to the monitor-running containers. The only shared configuration between them is the one set at the Docker daemon level.",

      "body": "In synthetic monitoring, a private location is a collection of private minions. A minion is a containerized application that receives and manages jobs set up through the Synthetics UI. A private location can contain any number of private minions. Private locations allow you to extend your synthetic monitoring coverage to new geographical locations, and to monitor websites behind your firewall (like an intranet site). What you need To use private locations, first review these requirements and other factors: Compatibility for... Requirements Check budget Checks from a private location count against your budget. Synthetics horde endpoint For US-based accounts: https://synthetics-horde.nr-data.net/ For EU-based accounts: https://synthetics-horde.eu01.nr-data.net/ Outbound network access The minion needs to connect to the synthetic monitoring's horde endpoint to receive and process jobs. If your firewall rules don't permit direct access, you must configure proxy access. Test your connection to the horde endpoint with a successful response from the following command: curl -X GET https://synthetics-horde.nr-data.net/synthetics/api/v1/ping Copy Account access and permissions How access works depends on your user model: Original user model: If a private location is set up by an account with child accounts, it can be used by users with access to those child accounts. But if it's set up on a child account, it can only be used by users in that account. New Relic One user model: user access to an account depends on whether they've been granted access to that account. Create a private location one.newrelic.com > Synthetics > Private Locations: Use the Private Locations page to create, edit, and delete private locations. Before installing private minions, you need to create a private location. To create a new private location: Ensure you meet the requirements, including activating the feature by contacting your account representative. Go to one.newrelic.com > Synthetics > Private locations. Then select Create private location. Tip The Private locations sub menu becomes available after you create your first monitor. Type a location name. Optional: Configure these additional settings: Description: Describe your private location for other account users. Verified script execution: Require a passphrase when assigning scripts to this location, or when adding minions to the location. Select Create. After creating the location, Synthetics lists your Private location key so you can install a private minion. Ping monitor checks Each minion can run about 200 ping monitor checks per minute (about 8,640,000 checks per month). If the job queue for a particular location is growing, add additional minions. The exact capacity of the minions can vary, depending on: Your network performance The complexity of your scripts The hardware configuration for the private minion Add jobs to the location queue To add jobs to the queue for your location, follow standard procedures to add or edit a monitor, and select your location from the Private locations list. To assign an existing monitor, edit that monitor's settings. one.newrelic.com > Synthetics > Create monitor: To assign new jobs to your private location and its minions, select its name from the Create monitor page. Manage private locations Tip If you can't access this feature, check the Factors affecting access to features and data. Synthetic monitoring includes tools to manage locations and individual minions. You can also install new minions, and clear the job queue if it backs up. To access these tools, go to one.newrelic.com > Synthetics > Private locations. Then follow the steps: If you want to... Do this... Clear the job queue Click the icon, and select Clear queue. This is useful when the number of scheduled jobs has increased faster than the minions can process them, such as when the minion is offline. View the status of an individual minion Select the parent location's name from the list. The green health status indicator identifies active minions. You can also view the last reported time for each minion, and check whether the minion software is out of date. Change location or view the private location key Click the icon, and select Edit. Delete a location Click the icon for the location, and select Delete. This does not shut down any minions assigned to that location. The minions must be shut down manually or reassigned. Enable or disable verified script execution Legacy minions: Verified script execution requires that you set up a passphrase on the minion before assigning any scripts to the location. CPM: You need to pass the MINION_VSE_PASSPHRASE variable to the minion. Then, at the Private locations tab, click on Edit and, in the menu, enable the Verified script execution option.

For example, Monitor A might check 50 times per day, and Monitor B might check 150 times per day. If Monitor A has 29 successes out of 50 and Monitor B has 148 successes out of 150, the Uptime would be 88.5: (29+148)/(50+150)=88.5 For individual SLA reports, the uptime score only includes the selected monitor.

Proxy settings API for scripted monitors Important You can set proxy server configuration for synthetic scripted monitors for monitor versions 0.4.0 or higher. The global object $network allows you to control the network configuration used by your synthetic scripted monitors. The following are applicable for both scripted browsers and API tests, unless otherwise stated. $network.setProxy(string or object PROXY URL) Sets a proxy server to be used for all per-URL requests (HTTP, HTTPS, and FTP). Additional notes: The port is optional. If not provided, it will be derived from the scheme. For example, for HTTP the port would be 80. The username and password are assumed to be the result of a call to encodeURIComponent(). Special characters like @ and : in the username and/or the password must be escaped. Returns This method returns a Promise that will resolve once the configuration has been applied. Parameters Parameter Data Type Description proxyURL | proxyUrlParsed String or Object The URL to connect to the proxy server. A string containing a proxyURL (for example, http://proxy_host:8888) or a plain object in the same format as defined by Node's url.parse(urlString) method. Examples An example of setting a proxy server with HTTP protocol on port 1234 with no authentication: $network.setProxy('http://host.com:1234') Copy An example of setting a proxy server with HTTP protocol with authentication credentials. $network.setProxy('http://proxyUsername:proxyPassword@proxyHost:1234') Copy $network.setProxyForHttp(string or object PROXY URL) Tip This call is exactly the same as the per-URL setProxy call, except that it applies to HTTP traffic.

Examples An example of setting a proxy server with HTTP protocol on port 1234 with no authentication: $network.setProxyForHttp('http://host.com:1234') Copy An example of setting a proxy server with HTTP protocol with authentication credentials. $network.setProxyForHttp('http://proxyUsername:proxyPassword@proxyHost:1234') Copy $network.setProxyForHttps(string or object PROXY URL) Tip This call is exactly the same as the per-URL setProxy call, except that it applies to HTTPS traffic. Sets a proxy server to be used for all HTTPS requests. Additional notes: The port is optional. If not provided, it will be derived from the scheme. For example, for HTTP the default port would be 443. The username and password are assumed to be the result of a call to encodeURIComponent(). Special characters like @ and : in the username and/or the password must be escaped. Returns This method returns a Promise that will resolve once the configuration has been applied. Parameters Parameter Data Type Description proxyURL | proxyUrlParsed String or Object The URL to connect to the proxy server. A string containing a proxyURL (for example, http://proxy_host:8888) or a plain object in the same format as defined by Node's url.parse(urlString) method. Examples An example of setting a proxy server with HTTPS protocol on port 1234 with no authentication: $network.setProxyForHttps('https://host.com:1234') Copy An example of setting a proxy server with HTTPS protocol with authentication credentials. $network.setProxyForHttps('https://proxyUsername:proxyPassword@proxyHost:1234') Copy $network.setProxyPAC(string PAC SCRIPT URL, object AUTH OBJECT) Sets a proxy server via a proxy auto-config (PAC) script and returns a promise. This function is only available for scripted browser monitors. Returns This method returns a Promise that will resolve once the configuration has been applied. Parameters Parameter Data Type Description scriptURL String The URL of the PAC script. authCredentialsMap Object Map of authentication credentials to be provided to the proxy server(s), keyed by the hostnames of the proxy server. Values of this map must be defined in the format {username: 'authUsername', password: 'authPassword'} Examples An example of setting a proxy server via a proxy auto-config (PAC) script: var authCredentialsMap = { 'example.com': {username: 'authUsername', password: 'authPassword'}, } Copy $network.setProxyAdvanced(object PROXY RULES OBJECT) Tip This method is Chrome-specific: it only applies to scripted browser monitor types. It can be used to allow for a more flexible and complex proxy configuration. In most cases, this method will not be needed. Sets the proxy configuration using the format supported by Chrome Extension API for Proxying. The input is a ProxyRules object, as defined by the Chrome Extension API to configures proxies. You can add authCredentials for proxies that need it. See Parameters for more details. Returns This method returns a Promise that will resolve once the configuration has been applied. Parameters Parameter Data Type Description ProxyRules Object Object The proxyRulesObject is a plain object that follows the format ProxyRules as defined by the Chrome Extension API to configures proxies. This object is \"flavoured\" to fit our runtime: users can define an additional property, authCredentials, for the Proxy server objects to provide authentication credentials for a specific proxy server. authCredentials is an object in the format {username: 'authUsername', password: 'authPassword'}. Examples Here's an example of creating a proxyRules with authCredentials: var proxyRules = { singleProxy: { host:\"example.com\", authCredentials: { username: 'authUsername', password: 'authPassword' } } }; Copy Here's an example of setting up a proxied network with mixed network zone assets: var proxyRules = {singleProxy: {host:\"http://entproxy.mycompany.com\"}, bypassList:['s3.amazonaws.com','*.localcdn.com'] } $network.setProxyAdvanced(proxyRules) Copy $network.clearProxy() Clears/removes the current proxy configuration. Returns This method returns a Promise that will resolve once the configuration has been applied. $network.getProxy() This method returns the current proxy configuration. It must be synchronized in a promise callback. Examples An example of synchronizing getProxy with $network.setProxy(); and $network.clearProxy();: var assert = require('assert'); $network.setProxy(\"http://user:password@myproxyurl.com\") .then(function () { console.log('Proxy configuration applied'); //Note: $network.getProxy() is not synchronized with the webdriver Control Flow. //To make sure we get the proxy configuration after the call to setProxy() above // succeeds we need to use a promise callback var proxyData = $network.getProxy(); console.log(proxyData); }) .then(function () { // Again: getProxy() is not synchronized with the Webdriver Control Flow: we //need this promise callback otherwise clearProxy() might be called before the call // to getProxy() above returns return $network.clearProxy(); }) .then(function () { console.log('Proxy configuration cleared'); // We need this promise callback for reasons explained above var proxyData = $network.getProxy(); assert.equal(proxyData.rules, null); }); Copy Proxy properties Important This proxy information applies only to these versions: API monitors: 0.4.0, 0.2.2, 0.2.1, 0.1.0 Scripted monitors: 0.1.0 In order to analyze and collect your HTTP traffic metrics, New Relic must ensure the traffic passes through a conceptual funnel. Our synthetic monitoring includes a software funnel component capable of analyzing the HTTP requests or responses and then recording the information. New Relic's scripted browser monitors (versions 0.4.x and lower) include a mechanism to do this analysis without needing an HTTP proxy, so you don't have to configure anything. New Relic's API test (versions 0.4.x and lower) provides an $http object that is pre-configured to make the requests pass through the internal HTTP proxy. This allows you to write your test without including any proxy settings. If you want to use some other way to generate HTTP traffic while still collecting the HTTP traffic metrics, you can use $env.PROXY_HOST and $env.PROXY_PORT. To record traffic metrics, be sure to include these properties in your script.

View synthetic monitoring SLA reports To view your account-wide SLA report: Go to one.newrelic.com > Synthetics > SLA Report. Choose from reports aggregated by day, week, or month by selecting Daily, Weekly, or Monthly as appropriate. You can also view SLA reports for individual monitors: Go to one.newrelic.com > Synthetics > (select a monitor) > SLA. one.newrelic.com > Synthetics > SLA Report: Use SLA reports to understand your monitors' performance over time. Understand SLA report metrics Use SLA reports to view aggregated performance metrics for a single monitor, or for all your monitors from the account-wide SLA Reports page. SLA reports include the following metrics: Duration: The average duration across all monitor results. Uptime: The percentage of all monitor results that ended successfully. For example, Monitor A might check 50 times per day, and Monitor B might check 150 times per day. If Monitor A has 29 successes out of 50 and Monitor B has 148 successes out of 150, the Uptime would be 88.5: (29+148)/(50+150)=88.5 For individual SLA reports, the uptime score only includes the selected monitor. Apdex: The average Apdex across all monitors. Monitors have a default Apdex T of 7 seconds, but you can customize Apdex T for individual monitors by editing their settings. Apdex F, which defines a frustrating result, is always four times Apdex T. For more information about Apdex, see Apdex: Measuring user satisfaction. For individual SLA reports, the Apdex score only includes the selected monitor. % Satisfied: The percentage of monitor results which complete in a \"satisfying\" time. A satisfying time is defined as a monitor result that completes in Apdex T or less. % Toleration: The percentage of monitor results which complete in a \"tolerable\" time. A tolerable time is greater than Apdex T, but less than Apdex F (four times Apdex T). % Frustrated: The percentage of monitor results which complete in a \"frustrating\" time. A frustrating time is greater than Apdex F (four times Apdex T). The account-wide SLA report includes all monitor types (ping, simple browser, scripted browser, and API test).

View the report in Excel or an external program Select Download this report as .csv to download a copy of your SLA data. Open the file in Excel, Google Drive, or another spreadsheet editor to analyze your data. Change your Apdex targets The default Apdex T for all monitors is 7 seconds. You can customize your Apdex T target for individual monitors by editing your monitor. Change the time frame Choose from daily, weekly, or monthly aggregation by selecting the appropriate tab. Make the report public Change the Public SLA setting to ON to allow non-authenticated users to view the report. Select Share Report to get the public URL to share. Generate SLA values The values in the SLA report are generated from Insights queries against the available synthetic monitoring data. You can easily recreate these values and modify the queries to meet your needs. This query returns the average duration, the apdex, and the uptime. Substitute your values for the variables highlighted and described below. SELECT average(duration), apdex(duration, t:), percentage(count(*), WHERE result='SUCCESS') FROM SyntheticCheck FACET timeperiod Copy Variable Value t: Supply the Apdex T that you would like to calculate your apdex against. The duration attribute in the SyntheticCheck event is stored in milliseconds, so an Apdex T value of 7 seconds should be included as 7000. timeperiod This is the period that you would like to calculate on. For a daily report, facet on dateOf(timestamp), for a weekly report facet on weekOf(timestamp) and for a monthly report facet on monthOf(timestamp).

      "body": "Use synthetic monitoring's API tests to monitor your API endpoint to ensure it is functioning correctly. New Relic uses the http-request module internally to make HTTP calls to your endpoint and validate the results. Here we present some example functions showing how to use the $http object to submit your request. For detailed documentation on the options available for this object, see the http-request readme. Tip To view and share other API test examples, visit the synthetics scripts section in Explorers Hub. Use API http-request module API tests are powered by the http-request module, which is available through the $http object. Once each frequency interval, New Relic queries your endpoint from each of your selected locations. For instructions on creating a monitor, see Adding monitors. Read on to learn how to define metadata for your request, make a GET request, make a POST request, and how to validate the results. Important After a maximum run time of three minutes, New Relic manually stops the script. one.newrelic.com > Synthetics > Create monitor: The script editor suggests functions, selectors, and other elements to simplify scripting commands (available in GitHub). Configure request options To start your script: Declare a variable (such as options) to store your request options object. Define request options such as the URL endpoint, and custom headers. If you're setting SSL or agent options, see SSL and agentOptions requirements. Tip For a full list of supported request options, see request(options, callback) in the http-request documentation on GitHub. Here's an example of optional metadata in the options object: Using optional metadata //Declare optional metadata var options = { //Specify the endpoint URL url: 'https://api-endpoint.example.com', //Specify optional headers headers: { 'Endpoint-Key': 'uqNTC57Phe72pnnB8JuJmwAr7b09nKSKSz', 'Additional-Header': 'Additional-Header-Data' } }; Copy For SSL and agentOptions: If you are setting SSL options or providing an agentOptions object, the agent property in the request options object will need to be set to $globalAgents.https or $globalAgents.http to ensure your HTTP requests use the instrumented global agent. Here's an example of using a SSL option or agentOptions: Using a SSL option or agentOptions This example uses agentOptions: //Declare optional metadata var options = { //Specify the endpoint URL url: 'https://api-endpoint.example.com', //Specify optional headers headers: { 'Endpoint-Key': 'uqNTC57Phe72pnnB8JuJmwAr7b09nKSKSz', 'Additional-Header': 'Additional-Header-Data' } //Specify global agent as the http agent agent: $globalAgents.https, //Set SSL option strictSSL: true, //Specify http agent options agentOptions: { ​maxVersion: 'TLSv1.1' }, }; Copy Send a GET request To make a GET request, use the $http.get method to submit your request. Define your request options, make your request using $http.get, then validate the response to ensure your endpoint is returning the correct results. Insights GET example This example queries the Insights API by using GET: //Define your authentication credentials var myAccountID = '{YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID}'; var myQueryKey = '{YOUR_QUERY_KEY}'; var options = { //Define endpoint URI uri: 'https://insights-api.newrelic.com/v1/accounts/'+myAccountID+'/query?nrql=SELECT%20average(amount)%20FROM%20SyntheticsEvent', //Define query key and expected data type. headers: { 'X-Query-Key': myQueryKey, 'Accept': 'application/json' } }; //Define expected results using callback function. function callback (err, response, body){ //Log JSON results from endpoint to Synthetics console. console.log(JSON.parse(body)); console.log('done with script'); } //Make GET request, passing in options and callback. $http.get(options,callback); Copy Send a POST request To make a POST request, use the $http.post method to submit your request. Define your request options, make your request using $http.post, then validate the response to ensure your endpoint is returning the correct results. Custom event POST example This example POSTs a custom event containing static integers to the Event API: //Define your authentication credentials. var myAccountID = '{YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID}'; var myLicenseKey = '{YOUR_LICENSE_KEY}'; //Import the 'assert' module to validate results. var assert = require('assert'); var options = { //Define endpoint URL. url: \"https://insights-collector.newrelic.com/v1/accounts/\"+myAccountID+\"/events\", //Define body of POST request. body: '[{\"eventType\":\"SyntheticsEvent\",\"integer1\":1000,\"integer2\":2000}]', //Define New Relic license key and expected data type. headers: { 'Api-Key': myLicenseKey, 'Content-Type': 'application/json' } }; //Define expected results using callback function. function callback(error, response, body) { //Log status code to Synthetics console. console.log(response.statusCode + \" status code\") //Verify endpoint returns 200 (OK) response code. assert.ok(response.statusCode == 200, 'Expected 200 OK response'); //Parse JSON received from Insights into variable. var info = JSON.parse(body); //Verify that `info` contains element named `success` with a value of `true`. assert.ok(info.success == true, 'Expected True results in Response Body, result was ' + info.success); //Log end of script. console.log(\"End reached\"); } //Make POST request, passing in options and callback. $http.post(options, callback); Copy Validate results To validate your results, import the assert module to define your test case. Call an assert method to validate your endpoint's response. If any assert functions fail, the entire monitor will be considered a failed check. This may trigger alert notifications and affect your metrics. Important Synthetic monitoring does not allow thrown exceptions. Thrown exceptions result in script failure. Use the assert module to validate your results, and use console.log() to log results to the synthetic's console. Event API validation example This example POSTs to the Event API, then validates that the response is {\"success\":true}: //Define your authentication credentials. var myAccountID = '{YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID}'; var myLicenseKey = '{YOUR_LICENSE_KEY}'; //Import the `assert` module to validate results. var assert = require('assert'); var options = { //Define endpoint URL. url: \"https://insights-collector.newrelic.com/v1/accounts/\"+myAccountID+\"/events\", //Define body of POST request. body: '[{\"eventType\":\"SyntheticsEvent\",\"integer1\":1000,\"integer2\":2000}]', //Define New Relic license key and expected data type. headers: { 'Api-Key': myLicenseKey, 'Content-Type': 'application/json' } }; $http.post(options, function(error, response, body) { //Log status code to Synthetics console. The status code is logged before the `assert` function, //because a failed assert function ends the script. console.log(response.statusCode + \" status code\") //Call `assert` method, expecting a `200` response code. //If assertion fails, log `Expected 200 OK response` as error message to Synthetics console. assert.ok(response.statusCode == 200, 'Expected 200 OK response'); var info = JSON.parse(body); //Call `assert` method, expecting body to return `{\"success\":true}`. //If assertion fails, log `Expected True results in Response Body,` plus results as error message to Synthetics console. assert.ok(info.success == true, 'Expected True results in Response Body, result was ' + info.success); }); Copy",

Examples An example of setting a proxy server with HTTPS protocol on port 1234 with no authentication: $network.setProxyForHttps('https://host.com:1234') Copy An example of setting a proxy server with HTTPS protocol with authentication credentials. $network.setProxyForHttps('https://proxyUsername:proxyPassword@proxyHost:1234') Copy $network.setProxyPAC(string PAC SCRIPT URL, object AUTH OBJECT) Sets a proxy server via a proxy auto-config (PAC) script and returns a promise. This function is only available for scripted browser monitors. Returns This method returns a Promise that will resolve once the configuration has been applied. Parameters Parameter Data Type Description scriptURL String The URL of the PAC script. authCredentialsMap Object Map of authentication credentials to be provided to the proxy server(s), keyed by the hostnames of the proxy server. Values of this map must be defined in the format {username: 'authUsername', password: 'authPassword'} Examples An example of setting a proxy server via a proxy auto-config (PAC) script: var authCredentialsMap = { 'example.com': {username: 'authUsername', password: 'authPassword'}, } Copy $network.setProxyAdvanced(object PROXY RULES OBJECT) Tip This method is Chrome-specific: it only applies to scripted browser monitor types. It can be used to allow for a more flexible and complex proxy configuration. In most cases, this method will not be needed. Sets the proxy configuration using the format supported by Chrome Extension API for Proxying. The input is a ProxyRules object, as defined by the Chrome Extension API to configures proxies. You can add authCredentials for proxies that need it. See Parameters for more details. Returns This method returns a Promise that will resolve once the configuration has been applied. Parameters Parameter Data Type Description ProxyRules Object Object The proxyRulesObject is a plain object that follows the format ProxyRules as defined by the Chrome Extension API to configures proxies. This object is \"flavoured\" to fit our runtime: users can define an additional property, authCredentials, for the Proxy server objects to provide authentication credentials for a specific proxy server. authCredentials is an object in the format {username: 'authUsername', password: 'authPassword'}. Examples Here's an example of creating a proxyRules with authCredentials: var proxyRules = { singleProxy: { host:\"example.com\", authCredentials: { username: 'authUsername', password: 'authPassword' } } }; Copy Here's an example of setting up a proxied network with mixed network zone assets: var proxyRules = {singleProxy: {host:\"http://entproxy.mycompany.com\"}, bypassList:['s3.amazonaws.com','*.localcdn.com'] } $network.setProxyAdvanced(proxyRules) Copy $network.clearProxy() Clears/removes the current proxy configuration. Returns This method returns a Promise that will resolve once the configuration has been applied. $network.getProxy() This method returns the current proxy configuration. It must be synchronized in a promise callback. Examples An example of synchronizing getProxy with $network.setProxy(); and $network.clearProxy();: var assert = require('assert'); $network.setProxy(\"http://user:password@myproxyurl.com\") .then(function () { console.log('Proxy configuration applied'); //Note: $network.getProxy() is not synchronized with the webdriver Control Flow. //To make sure we get the proxy configuration after the call to setProxy() above // succeeds we need to use a promise callback var proxyData = $network.getProxy(); console.log(proxyData); }) .then(function () { // Again: getProxy() is not synchronized with the Webdriver Control Flow: we //need this promise callback otherwise clearProxy() might be called before the call // to getProxy() above returns return $network.clearProxy(); }) .then(function () { console.log('Proxy configuration cleared'); // We need this promise callback for reasons explained above var proxyData = $network.getProxy(); assert.equal(proxyData.rules, null); }); Copy Proxy properties Important This proxy information applies only to these versions: API monitors: 0.4.0, 0.2.2, 0.2.1, 0.1.0 Scripted monitors: 0.1.0 In order to analyze and collect your HTTP traffic metrics, New Relic must ensure the traffic passes through a conceptual funnel. Our synthetic monitoring includes a software funnel component capable of analyzing the HTTP requests or responses and then recording the information. New Relic's scripted browser monitors (versions 0.4.x and lower) include a mechanism to do this analysis without needing an HTTP proxy, so you don't have to configure anything. New Relic's API test (versions 0.4.x and lower) provides an $http object that is pre-configured to make the requests pass through the internal HTTP proxy. This allows you to write your test without including any proxy settings. If you want to use some other way to generate HTTP traffic while still collecting the HTTP traffic metrics, you can use $env.PROXY_HOST and $env.PROXY_PORT. To record traffic metrics, be sure to include these properties in your script.

View synthetic monitoring SLA reports To view your account-wide SLA report: Go to one.newrelic.com > Synthetics > SLA Report. Choose from reports aggregated by day, week, or month by selecting Daily, Weekly, or Monthly as appropriate. You can also view SLA reports for individual monitors: Go to one.newrelic.com > Synthetics > (select a monitor) > SLA. one.newrelic.com > Synthetics > SLA Report: Use SLA reports to understand your monitors' performance over time. Understand SLA report metrics Use SLA reports to view aggregated performance metrics for a single monitor, or for all your monitors from the account-wide SLA Reports page. SLA reports include the following metrics: Duration: The average duration across all monitor results. Uptime: The percentage of all monitor results that ended successfully. For example, Monitor A might check 50 times per day, and Monitor B might check 150 times per day. If Monitor A has 29 successes out of 50 and Monitor B has 148 successes out of 150, the Uptime would be 88.5: (29+148)/(50+150)=88.5 For individual SLA reports, the uptime score only includes the selected monitor. Apdex: The average Apdex across all monitors. Monitors have a default Apdex T of 7 seconds, but you can customize Apdex T for individual monitors by editing their settings. Apdex F, which defines a frustrating result, is always four times Apdex T. For more information about Apdex, see Apdex: Measuring user satisfaction. For individual SLA reports, the Apdex score only includes the selected monitor. % Satisfied: The percentage of monitor results which complete in a \"satisfying\" time. A satisfying time is defined as a monitor result that completes in Apdex T or less. % Toleration: The percentage of monitor results which complete in a \"tolerable\" time. A tolerable time is greater than Apdex T, but less than Apdex F (four times Apdex T). % Frustrated: The percentage of monitor results which complete in a \"frustrating\" time. A frustrating time is greater than Apdex F (four times Apdex T). The account-wide SLA report includes all monitor types (ping, simple browser, scripted browser, and API test).

View the report in Excel or an external program Select Download this report as .csv to download a copy of your SLA data. Open the file in Excel, Google Drive, or another spreadsheet editor to analyze your data. Change your Apdex targets The default Apdex T for all monitors is 7 seconds. You can customize your Apdex T target for individual monitors by editing your monitor. Change the time frame Choose from daily, weekly, or monthly aggregation by selecting the appropriate tab. Make the report public Change the Public SLA setting to ON to allow non-authenticated users to view the report. Select Share Report to get the public URL to share. Generate SLA values The values in the SLA report are generated from Insights queries against the available synthetic monitoring data. You can easily recreate these values and modify the queries to meet your needs. This query returns the average duration, the apdex, and the uptime. Substitute your values for the variables highlighted and described below. SELECT average(duration), apdex(duration, t:), percentage(count(*), WHERE result='SUCCESS') FROM SyntheticCheck FACET timeperiod Copy Variable Value t: Supply the Apdex T that you would like to calculate your apdex against. The duration attribute in the SyntheticCheck event is stored in milliseconds, so an Apdex T value of 7 seconds should be included as 7000. timeperiod This is the period that you would like to calculate on. For a daily report, facet on dateOf(timestamp), for a weekly report facet on weekOf(timestamp) and for a monthly report facet on monthOf(timestamp).

      "body": "Use synthetic monitoring's API tests to monitor your API endpoint to ensure it is functioning correctly. New Relic uses the http-request module internally to make HTTP calls to your endpoint and validate the results. Here we present some example functions showing how to use the $http object to submit your request. For detailed documentation on the options available for this object, see the http-request readme. Tip To view and share other API test examples, visit the synthetics scripts section in Explorers Hub. Use API http-request module API tests are powered by the http-request module, which is available through the $http object. Once each frequency interval, New Relic queries your endpoint from each of your selected locations. For instructions on creating a monitor, see Adding monitors. Read on to learn how to define metadata for your request, make a GET request, make a POST request, and how to validate the results. Important After a maximum run time of three minutes, New Relic manually stops the script. one.newrelic.com > Synthetics > Create monitor: The script editor suggests functions, selectors, and other elements to simplify scripting commands (available in GitHub). Configure request options To start your script: Declare a variable (such as options) to store your request options object. Define request options such as the URL endpoint, and custom headers. If you're setting SSL or agent options, see SSL and agentOptions requirements. Tip For a full list of supported request options, see request(options, callback) in the http-request documentation on GitHub. Here's an example of optional metadata in the options object: Using optional metadata //Declare optional metadata var options = { //Specify the endpoint URL url: 'https://api-endpoint.example.com', //Specify optional headers headers: { 'Endpoint-Key': 'uqNTC57Phe72pnnB8JuJmwAr7b09nKSKSz', 'Additional-Header': 'Additional-Header-Data' } }; Copy For SSL and agentOptions: If you are setting SSL options or providing an agentOptions object, the agent property in the request options object will need to be set to $globalAgents.https or $globalAgents.http to ensure your HTTP requests use the instrumented global agent. Here's an example of using a SSL option or agentOptions: Using a SSL option or agentOptions This example uses agentOptions: //Declare optional metadata var options = { //Specify the endpoint URL url: 'https://api-endpoint.example.com', //Specify optional headers headers: { 'Endpoint-Key': 'uqNTC57Phe72pnnB8JuJmwAr7b09nKSKSz', 'Additional-Header': 'Additional-Header-Data' } //Specify global agent as the http agent agent: $globalAgents.https, //Set SSL option strictSSL: true, //Specify http agent options agentOptions: { ​maxVersion: 'TLSv1.1' }, }; Copy Send a GET request To make a GET request, use the $http.get method to submit your request. Define your request options, make your request using $http.get, then validate the response to ensure your endpoint is returning the correct results. Insights GET example This example queries the Insights API by using GET: //Define your authentication credentials var myAccountID = '{YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID}'; var myQueryKey = '{YOUR_QUERY_KEY}'; var options = { //Define endpoint URI uri: 'https://insights-api.newrelic.com/v1/accounts/'+myAccountID+'/query?nrql=SELECT%20average(amount)%20FROM%20SyntheticsEvent', //Define query key and expected data type. headers: { 'X-Query-Key': myQueryKey, 'Accept': 'application/json' } }; //Define expected results using callback function. function callback (err, response, body){ //Log JSON results from endpoint to Synthetics console. console.log(JSON.parse(body)); console.log('done with script'); } //Make GET request, passing in options and callback. $http.get(options,callback); Copy Send a POST request To make a POST request, use the $http.post method to submit your request. Define your request options, make your request using $http.post, then validate the response to ensure your endpoint is returning the correct results. Custom event POST example This example POSTs a custom event containing static integers to the Event API: //Define your authentication credentials. var myAccountID = '{YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID}'; var myLicenseKey = '{YOUR_LICENSE_KEY}'; //Import the 'assert' module to validate results. var assert = require('assert'); var options = { //Define endpoint URL. url: \"https://insights-collector.newrelic.com/v1/accounts/\"+myAccountID+\"/events\", //Define body of POST request. body: '[{\"eventType\":\"SyntheticsEvent\",\"integer1\":1000,\"integer2\":2000}]', //Define New Relic license key and expected data type. headers: { 'Api-Key': myLicenseKey, 'Content-Type': 'application/json' } }; //Define expected results using callback function. function callback(error, response, body) { //Log status code to Synthetics console. console.log(response.statusCode + \" status code\") //Verify endpoint returns 200 (OK) response code. assert.ok(response.statusCode == 200, 'Expected 200 OK response'); //Parse JSON received from Insights into variable. var info = JSON.parse(body); //Verify that `info` contains element named `success` with a value of `true`. assert.ok(info.success == true, 'Expected True results in Response Body, result was ' + info.success); //Log end of script. console.log(\"End reached\"); } //Make POST request, passing in options and callback. $http.post(options, callback); Copy Validate results To validate your results, import the assert module to define your test case. Call an assert method to validate your endpoint's response. If any assert functions fail, the entire monitor will be considered a failed check. This may trigger alert notifications and affect your metrics. Important Synthetic monitoring does not allow thrown exceptions. Thrown exceptions result in script failure. Use the assert module to validate your results, and use console.log() to log results to the synthetic's console. Event API validation example This example POSTs to the Event API, then validates that the response is {\"success\":true}: //Define your authentication credentials. var myAccountID = '{YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID}'; var myLicenseKey = '{YOUR_LICENSE_KEY}'; //Import the `assert` module to validate results. var assert = require('assert'); var options = { //Define endpoint URL. url: \"https://insights-collector.newrelic.com/v1/accounts/\"+myAccountID+\"/events\", //Define body of POST request. body: '[{\"eventType\":\"SyntheticsEvent\",\"integer1\":1000,\"integer2\":2000}]', //Define New Relic license key and expected data type. headers: { 'Api-Key': myLicenseKey, 'Content-Type': 'application/json' } }; $http.post(options, function(error, response, body) { //Log status code to Synthetics console. The status code is logged before the `assert` function, //because a failed assert function ends the script. console.log(response.statusCode + \" status code\") //Call `assert` method, expecting a `200` response code. //If assertion fails, log `Expected 200 OK response` as error message to Synthetics console. assert.ok(response.statusCode == 200, 'Expected 200 OK response'); var info = JSON.parse(body); //Call `assert` method, expecting body to return `{\"success\":true}`. //If assertion fails, log `Expected True results in Response Body,` plus results as error message to Synthetics console. assert.ok(info.success == true, 'Expected True results in Response Body, result was ' + info.success); }); Copy",

It can be used to allow for a more flexible and complex proxy configuration. In most cases, this method will not be needed. Sets the proxy configuration using the format supported by Chrome Extension API for Proxying. The input is a ProxyRules object, as defined by the Chrome Extension API to configures proxies. You can add authCredentials for proxies that need it. See Parameters for more details. Returns This method returns a Promise that will resolve once the configuration has been applied. Parameters Parameter Data Type Description ProxyRules Object Object The proxyRulesObject is a plain object that follows the format ProxyRules as defined by the Chrome Extension API to configures proxies. This object is \"flavoured\" to fit our runtime: users can define an additional property, authCredentials, for the Proxy server objects to provide authentication credentials for a specific proxy server. authCredentials is an object in the format {username: 'authUsername', password: 'authPassword'}. Examples Here's an example of creating a proxyRules with authCredentials: var proxyRules = { singleProxy: { host:\"example.com\", authCredentials: { username: 'authUsername', password: 'authPassword' } } }; Copy Here's an example of setting up a proxied network with mixed network zone assets: var proxyRules = {singleProxy: {host:\"http://entproxy.mycompany.com\"}, bypassList:['s3.amazonaws.com','*.localcdn.com'] } $network.setProxyAdvanced(proxyRules) Copy $network.clearProxy() Clears/removes the current proxy configuration. Returns This method returns a Promise that will resolve once the configuration has been applied. $network.getProxy() This method returns the current proxy configuration. It must be synchronized in a promise callback. Examples An example of synchronizing getProxy with $network.setProxy(); and $network.clearProxy();: var assert = require('assert'); $network.setProxy(\"http://user:password@myproxyurl.com\") .then(function () { console.log('Proxy configuration applied'); //Note: $network.getProxy() is not synchronized with the webdriver Control Flow. //To make sure we get the proxy configuration after the call to setProxy() above // succeeds we need to use a promise callback var proxyData = $network.getProxy(); console.log(proxyData); }) .then(function () { // Again: getProxy() is not synchronized with the Webdriver Control Flow: we //need this promise callback otherwise clearProxy() might be called before the call // to getProxy() above returns return $network.clearProxy(); }) .then(function () { console.log('Proxy configuration cleared'); // We need this promise callback for reasons explained above var proxyData = $network.getProxy(); assert.equal(proxyData.rules, null); }); Copy Proxy properties Important This proxy information applies only to these versions: API monitors: 0.4.0, 0.2.2, 0.2.1, 0.1.0 Scripted monitors: 0.1.0 In order to analyze and collect your HTTP traffic metrics, New Relic must ensure the traffic passes through a conceptual funnel. Our synthetic monitoring includes a software funnel component capable of analyzing the HTTP requests or responses and then recording the information. New Relic's scripted browser monitors (versions 0.4.x and lower) include a mechanism to do this analysis without needing an HTTP proxy, so you don't have to configure anything. New Relic's API test (versions 0.4.x and lower) provides an $http object that is pre-configured to make the requests pass through the internal HTTP proxy. This allows you to write your test without including any proxy settings. If you want to use some other way to generate HTTP traffic while still collecting the HTTP traffic metrics, you can use $env.PROXY_HOST and $env.PROXY_PORT. To record traffic metrics, be sure to include these properties in your script.

View synthetic monitoring SLA reports To view your account-wide SLA report: Go to one.newrelic.com > Synthetics > SLA Report. Choose from reports aggregated by day, week, or month by selecting Daily, Weekly, or Monthly as appropriate. You can also view SLA reports for individual monitors: Go to one.newrelic.com > Synthetics > (select a monitor) > SLA. one.newrelic.com > Synthetics > SLA Report: Use SLA reports to understand your monitors' performance over time. Understand SLA report metrics Use SLA reports to view aggregated performance metrics for a single monitor, or for all your monitors from the account-wide SLA Reports page. SLA reports include the following metrics: Duration: The average duration across all monitor results. Uptime: The percentage of all monitor results that ended successfully. For example, Monitor A might check 50 times per day, and Monitor B might check 150 times per day. If Monitor A has 29 successes out of 50 and Monitor B has 148 successes out of 150, the Uptime would be 88.5: (29+148)/(50+150)=88.5 For individual SLA reports, the uptime score only includes the selected monitor. Apdex: The average Apdex across all monitors. Monitors have a default Apdex T of 7 seconds, but you can customize Apdex T for individual monitors by editing their settings. Apdex F, which defines a frustrating result, is always four times Apdex T. For more information about Apdex, see Apdex: Measuring user satisfaction. For individual SLA reports, the Apdex score only includes the selected monitor. % Satisfied: The percentage of monitor results which complete in a \"satisfying\" time. A satisfying time is defined as a monitor result that completes in Apdex T or less. % Toleration: The percentage of monitor results which complete in a \"tolerable\" time. A tolerable time is greater than Apdex T, but less than Apdex F (four times Apdex T). % Frustrated: The percentage of monitor results which complete in a \"frustrating\" time. A frustrating time is greater than Apdex F (four times Apdex T). The account-wide SLA report includes all monitor types (ping, simple browser, scripted browser, and API test).

View the report in Excel or an external program Select Download this report as .csv to download a copy of your SLA data. Open the file in Excel, Google Drive, or another spreadsheet editor to analyze your data. Change your Apdex targets The default Apdex T for all monitors is 7 seconds. You can customize your Apdex T target for individual monitors by editing your monitor. Change the time frame Choose from daily, weekly, or monthly aggregation by selecting the appropriate tab. Make the report public Change the Public SLA setting to ON to allow non-authenticated users to view the report. Select Share Report to get the public URL to share. Generate SLA values The values in the SLA report are generated from Insights queries against the available synthetic monitoring data. You can easily recreate these values and modify the queries to meet your needs. This query returns the average duration, the apdex, and the uptime. Substitute your values for the variables highlighted and described below. SELECT average(duration), apdex(duration, t:), percentage(count(*), WHERE result='SUCCESS') FROM SyntheticCheck FACET timeperiod Copy Variable Value t: Supply the Apdex T that you would like to calculate your apdex against. The duration attribute in the SyntheticCheck event is stored in milliseconds, so an Apdex T value of 7 seconds should be included as 7000. timeperiod This is the period that you would like to calculate on. For a daily report, facet on dateOf(timestamp), for a weekly report facet on weekOf(timestamp) and for a monthly report facet on monthOf(timestamp).

      "body": "Use synthetic monitoring's API tests to monitor your API endpoint to ensure it is functioning correctly. New Relic uses the http-request module internally to make HTTP calls to your endpoint and validate the results. Here we present some example functions showing how to use the $http object to submit your request. For detailed documentation on the options available for this object, see the http-request readme. Tip To view and share other API test examples, visit the synthetics scripts section in Explorers Hub. Use API http-request module API tests are powered by the http-request module, which is available through the $http object. Once each frequency interval, New Relic queries your endpoint from each of your selected locations. For instructions on creating a monitor, see Adding monitors. Read on to learn how to define metadata for your request, make a GET request, make a POST request, and how to validate the results. Important After a maximum run time of three minutes, New Relic manually stops the script. one.newrelic.com > Synthetics > Create monitor: The script editor suggests functions, selectors, and other elements to simplify scripting commands (available in GitHub). Configure request options To start your script: Declare a variable (such as options) to store your request options object. Define request options such as the URL endpoint, and custom headers. If you're setting SSL or agent options, see SSL and agentOptions requirements. Tip For a full list of supported request options, see request(options, callback) in the http-request documentation on GitHub. Here's an example of optional metadata in the options object: Using optional metadata //Declare optional metadata var options = { //Specify the endpoint URL url: 'https://api-endpoint.example.com', //Specify optional headers headers: { 'Endpoint-Key': 'uqNTC57Phe72pnnB8JuJmwAr7b09nKSKSz', 'Additional-Header': 'Additional-Header-Data' } }; Copy For SSL and agentOptions: If you are setting SSL options or providing an agentOptions object, the agent property in the request options object will need to be set to $globalAgents.https or $globalAgents.http to ensure your HTTP requests use the instrumented global agent. Here's an example of using a SSL option or agentOptions: Using a SSL option or agentOptions This example uses agentOptions: //Declare optional metadata var options = { //Specify the endpoint URL url: 'https://api-endpoint.example.com', //Specify optional headers headers: { 'Endpoint-Key': 'uqNTC57Phe72pnnB8JuJmwAr7b09nKSKSz', 'Additional-Header': 'Additional-Header-Data' } //Specify global agent as the http agent agent: $globalAgents.https, //Set SSL option strictSSL: true, //Specify http agent options agentOptions: { ​maxVersion: 'TLSv1.1' }, }; Copy Send a GET request To make a GET request, use the $http.get method to submit your request. Define your request options, make your request using $http.get, then validate the response to ensure your endpoint is returning the correct results. Insights GET example This example queries the Insights API by using GET: //Define your authentication credentials var myAccountID = '{YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID}'; var myQueryKey = '{YOUR_QUERY_KEY}'; var options = { //Define endpoint URI uri: 'https://insights-api.newrelic.com/v1/accounts/'+myAccountID+'/query?nrql=SELECT%20average(amount)%20FROM%20SyntheticsEvent', //Define query key and expected data type. headers: { 'X-Query-Key': myQueryKey, 'Accept': 'application/json' } }; //Define expected results using callback function. function callback (err, response, body){ //Log JSON results from endpoint to Synthetics console. console.log(JSON.parse(body)); console.log('done with script'); } //Make GET request, passing in options and callback. $http.get(options,callback); Copy Send a POST request To make a POST request, use the $http.post method to submit your request. Define your request options, make your request using $http.post, then validate the response to ensure your endpoint is returning the correct results. Custom event POST example This example POSTs a custom event containing static integers to the Event API: //Define your authentication credentials. var myAccountID = '{YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID}'; var myLicenseKey = '{YOUR_LICENSE_KEY}'; //Import the 'assert' module to validate results. var assert = require('assert'); var options = { //Define endpoint URL. url: \"https://insights-collector.newrelic.com/v1/accounts/\"+myAccountID+\"/events\", //Define body of POST request. body: '[{\"eventType\":\"SyntheticsEvent\",\"integer1\":1000,\"integer2\":2000}]', //Define New Relic license key and expected data type. headers: { 'Api-Key': myLicenseKey, 'Content-Type': 'application/json' } }; //Define expected results using callback function. function callback(error, response, body) { //Log status code to Synthetics console. console.log(response.statusCode + \" status code\") //Verify endpoint returns 200 (OK) response code. assert.ok(response.statusCode == 200, 'Expected 200 OK response'); //Parse JSON received from Insights into variable. var info = JSON.parse(body); //Verify that `info` contains element named `success` with a value of `true`. assert.ok(info.success == true, 'Expected True results in Response Body, result was ' + info.success); //Log end of script. console.log(\"End reached\"); } //Make POST request, passing in options and callback. $http.post(options, callback); Copy Validate results To validate your results, import the assert module to define your test case. Call an assert method to validate your endpoint's response. If any assert functions fail, the entire monitor will be considered a failed check. This may trigger alert notifications and affect your metrics. Important Synthetic monitoring does not allow thrown exceptions. Thrown exceptions result in script failure. Use the assert module to validate your results, and use console.log() to log results to the synthetic's console. Event API validation example This example POSTs to the Event API, then validates that the response is {\"success\":true}: //Define your authentication credentials. var myAccountID = '{YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID}'; var myLicenseKey = '{YOUR_LICENSE_KEY}'; //Import the `assert` module to validate results. var assert = require('assert'); var options = { //Define endpoint URL. url: \"https://insights-collector.newrelic.com/v1/accounts/\"+myAccountID+\"/events\", //Define body of POST request. body: '[{\"eventType\":\"SyntheticsEvent\",\"integer1\":1000,\"integer2\":2000}]', //Define New Relic license key and expected data type. headers: { 'Api-Key': myLicenseKey, 'Content-Type': 'application/json' } }; $http.post(options, function(error, response, body) { //Log status code to Synthetics console. The status code is logged before the `assert` function, //because a failed assert function ends the script. console.log(response.statusCode + \" status code\") //Call `assert` method, expecting a `200` response code. //If assertion fails, log `Expected 200 OK response` as error message to Synthetics console. assert.ok(response.statusCode == 200, 'Expected 200 OK response'); var info = JSON.parse(body); //Call `assert` method, expecting body to return `{\"success\":true}`. //If assertion fails, log `Expected True results in Response Body,` plus results as error message to Synthetics console. assert.ok(info.success == true, 'Expected True results in Response Body, result was ' + info.success); }); Copy",

Examples Here's an example of creating a proxyRules with authCredentials: var proxyRules = { singleProxy: { host:\"example.com\", authCredentials: { username: 'authUsername', password: 'authPassword' } } }; Copy Here's an example of setting up a proxied network with mixed network zone assets: var proxyRules = {singleProxy: {host:\"http://entproxy.mycompany.com\"}, bypassList:['s3.amazonaws.com','*.localcdn.com'] } $network.setProxyAdvanced(proxyRules) Copy $network.clearProxy() Clears/removes the current proxy configuration. Returns This method returns a Promise that will resolve once the configuration has been applied. $network.getProxy() This method returns the current proxy configuration. It must be synchronized in a promise callback. Examples An example of synchronizing getProxy with $network.setProxy(); and $network.clearProxy();: var assert = require('assert'); $network.setProxy(\"http://user:password@myproxyurl.com\") .then(function () { console.log('Proxy configuration applied'); //Note: $network.getProxy() is not synchronized with the webdriver Control Flow. //To make sure we get the proxy configuration after the call to setProxy() above // succeeds we need to use a promise callback var proxyData = $network.getProxy(); console.log(proxyData); }) .then(function () { // Again: getProxy() is not synchronized with the Webdriver Control Flow: we //need this promise callback otherwise clearProxy() might be called before the call // to getProxy() above returns return $network.clearProxy(); }) .then(function () { console.log('Proxy configuration cleared'); // We need this promise callback for reasons explained above var proxyData = $network.getProxy(); assert.equal(proxyData.rules, null); }); Copy Proxy properties Important This proxy information applies only to these versions: API monitors: 0.4.0, 0.2.2, 0.2.1, 0.1.0 Scripted monitors: 0.1.0 In order to analyze and collect your HTTP traffic metrics, New Relic must ensure the traffic passes through a conceptual funnel. Our synthetic monitoring includes a software funnel component capable of analyzing the HTTP requests or responses and then recording the information. New Relic's scripted browser monitors (versions 0.4.x and lower) include a mechanism to do this analysis without needing an HTTP proxy, so you don't have to configure anything. New Relic's API test (versions 0.4.x and lower) provides an $http object that is pre-configured to make the requests pass through the internal HTTP proxy. This allows you to write your test without including any proxy settings. If you want to use some other way to generate HTTP traffic while still collecting the HTTP traffic metrics, you can use $env.PROXY_HOST and $env.PROXY_PORT. To record traffic metrics, be sure to include these properties in your script.

You can also view SLA reports for individual monitors: Go to one.newrelic.com > Synthetics > (select a monitor) > SLA. one.newrelic.com > Synthetics > SLA Report: Use SLA reports to understand your monitors' performance over time. Understand SLA report metrics Use SLA reports to view aggregated performance metrics for a single monitor, or for all your monitors from the account-wide SLA Reports page. SLA reports include the following metrics: Duration: The average duration across all monitor results. Uptime: The percentage of all monitor results that ended successfully. For example, Monitor A might check 50 times per day, and Monitor B might check 150 times per day. If Monitor A has 29 successes out of 50 and Monitor B has 148 successes out of 150, the Uptime would be 88.5: (29+148)/(50+150)=88.5 For individual SLA reports, the uptime score only includes the selected monitor. Apdex: The average Apdex across all monitors. Monitors have a default Apdex T of 7 seconds, but you can customize Apdex T for individual monitors by editing their settings. Apdex F, which defines a frustrating result, is always four times Apdex T. For more information about Apdex, see Apdex: Measuring user satisfaction. For individual SLA reports, the Apdex score only includes the selected monitor. % Satisfied: The percentage of monitor results which complete in a \"satisfying\" time. A satisfying time is defined as a monitor result that completes in Apdex T or less. % Toleration: The percentage of monitor results which complete in a \"tolerable\" time. A tolerable time is greater than Apdex T, but less than Apdex F (four times Apdex T). % Frustrated: The percentage of monitor results which complete in a \"frustrating\" time.

      "body": "Use synthetic monitoring's API tests to monitor your API endpoint to ensure it is functioning correctly. New Relic uses the http-request module internally to make HTTP calls to your endpoint and validate the results. Here we present some example functions showing how to use the $http object to submit your request. For detailed documentation on the options available for this object, see the http-request readme. Tip To view and share other API test examples, visit the synthetics scripts section in Explorers Hub. Use API http-request module API tests are powered by the http-request module, which is available through the $http object. Once each frequency interval, New Relic queries your endpoint from each of your selected locations. For instructions on creating a monitor, see Adding monitors. Read on to learn how to define metadata for your request, make a GET request, make a POST request, and how to validate the results. Important After a maximum run time of three minutes, New Relic manually stops the script. one.newrelic.com > Synthetics > Create monitor: The script editor suggests functions, selectors, and other elements to simplify scripting commands (available in GitHub). Configure request options To start your script: Declare a variable (such as options) to store your request options object. Define request options such as the URL endpoint, and custom headers. If you're setting SSL or agent options, see SSL and agentOptions requirements. Tip For a full list of supported request options, see request(options, callback) in the http-request documentation on GitHub. Here's an example of optional metadata in the options object: Using optional metadata //Declare optional metadata var options = { //Specify the endpoint URL url: 'https://api-endpoint.example.com', //Specify optional headers headers: { 'Endpoint-Key': 'uqNTC57Phe72pnnB8JuJmwAr7b09nKSKSz', 'Additional-Header': 'Additional-Header-Data' } }; Copy For SSL and agentOptions: If you are setting SSL options or providing an agentOptions object, the agent property in the request options object will need to be set to $globalAgents.https or $globalAgents.http to ensure your HTTP requests use the instrumented global agent. Here's an example of using a SSL option or agentOptions: Using a SSL option or agentOptions This example uses agentOptions: //Declare optional metadata var options = { //Specify the endpoint URL url: 'https://api-endpoint.example.com', //Specify optional headers headers: { 'Endpoint-Key': 'uqNTC57Phe72pnnB8JuJmwAr7b09nKSKSz', 'Additional-Header': 'Additional-Header-Data' } //Specify global agent as the http agent agent: $globalAgents.https, //Set SSL option strictSSL: true, //Specify http agent options agentOptions: { ​maxVersion: 'TLSv1.1' }, }; Copy Send a GET request To make a GET request, use the $http.get method to submit your request. Define your request options, make your request using $http.get, then validate the response to ensure your endpoint is returning the correct results. Insights GET example This example queries the Insights API by using GET: //Define your authentication credentials var myAccountID = '{YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID}'; var myQueryKey = '{YOUR_QUERY_KEY}'; var options = { //Define endpoint URI uri: 'https://insights-api.newrelic.com/v1/accounts/'+myAccountID+'/query?nrql=SELECT%20average(amount)%20FROM%20SyntheticsEvent', //Define query key and expected data type. headers: { 'X-Query-Key': myQueryKey, 'Accept': 'application/json' } }; //Define expected results using callback function. function callback (err, response, body){ //Log JSON results from endpoint to Synthetics console. console.log(JSON.parse(body)); console.log('done with script'); } //Make GET request, passing in options and callback. $http.get(options,callback); Copy Send a POST request To make a POST request, use the $http.post method to submit your request. Define your request options, make your request using $http.post, then validate the response to ensure your endpoint is returning the correct results. Custom event POST example This example POSTs a custom event containing static integers to the Event API: //Define your authentication credentials. var myAccountID = '{YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID}'; var myLicenseKey = '{YOUR_LICENSE_KEY}'; //Import the 'assert' module to validate results. var assert = require('assert'); var options = { //Define endpoint URL. url: \"https://insights-collector.newrelic.com/v1/accounts/\"+myAccountID+\"/events\", //Define body of POST request. body: '[{\"eventType\":\"SyntheticsEvent\",\"integer1\":1000,\"integer2\":2000}]', //Define New Relic license key and expected data type. headers: { 'Api-Key': myLicenseKey, 'Content-Type': 'application/json' } }; //Define expected results using callback function. function callback(error, response, body) { //Log status code to Synthetics console. console.log(response.statusCode + \" status code\") //Verify endpoint returns 200 (OK) response code. assert.ok(response.statusCode == 200, 'Expected 200 OK response'); //Parse JSON received from Insights into variable. var info = JSON.parse(body); //Verify that `info` contains element named `success` with a value of `true`. assert.ok(info.success == true, 'Expected True results in Response Body, result was ' + info.success); //Log end of script. console.log(\"End reached\"); } //Make POST request, passing in options and callback. $http.post(options, callback); Copy Validate results To validate your results, import the assert module to define your test case. Call an assert method to validate your endpoint's response. If any assert functions fail, the entire monitor will be considered a failed check. This may trigger alert notifications and affect your metrics. Important Synthetic monitoring does not allow thrown exceptions. Thrown exceptions result in script failure. Use the assert module to validate your results, and use console.log() to log results to the synthetic's console. Event API validation example This example POSTs to the Event API, then validates that the response is {\"success\":true}: //Define your authentication credentials. var myAccountID = '{YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID}'; var myLicenseKey = '{YOUR_LICENSE_KEY}'; //Import the `assert` module to validate results. var assert = require('assert'); var options = { //Define endpoint URL. url: \"https://insights-collector.newrelic.com/v1/accounts/\"+myAccountID+\"/events\", //Define body of POST request. body: '[{\"eventType\":\"SyntheticsEvent\",\"integer1\":1000,\"integer2\":2000}]', //Define New Relic license key and expected data type. headers: { 'Api-Key': myLicenseKey, 'Content-Type': 'application/json' } }; $http.post(options, function(error, response, body) { //Log status code to Synthetics console. The status code is logged before the `assert` function, //because a failed assert function ends the script. console.log(response.statusCode + \" status code\") //Call `assert` method, expecting a `200` response code. //If assertion fails, log `Expected 200 OK response` as error message to Synthetics console. assert.ok(response.statusCode == 200, 'Expected 200 OK response'); var info = JSON.parse(body); //Call `assert` method, expecting body to return `{\"success\":true}`. //If assertion fails, log `Expected True results in Response Body,` plus results as error message to Synthetics console. assert.ok(info.success == true, 'Expected True results in Response Body, result was ' + info.success); }); Copy",

      "body": "Use synthetic monitoring's API tests to monitor your API endpoint to ensure it is functioning correctly. New Relic uses the http-request module internally to make HTTP calls to your endpoint and validate the results. Here we present some example functions showing how to use the $http object to submit your request. For detailed documentation on the options available for this object, see the http-request readme. Tip To view and share other API test examples, visit the synthetics scripts section in Explorers Hub. Use API http-request module API tests are powered by the http-request module, which is available through the $http object. Once each frequency interval, New Relic queries your endpoint from each of your selected locations. For instructions on creating a monitor, see Adding monitors. Read on to learn how to define metadata for your request, make a GET request, make a POST request, and how to validate the results. Important After a maximum run time of three minutes, New Relic manually stops the script. one.newrelic.com > Synthetics > Create monitor: The script editor suggests functions, selectors, and other elements to simplify scripting commands (available in GitHub). Configure request options To start your script: Declare a variable (such as options) to store your request options object. Define request options such as the URL endpoint, and custom headers. If you're setting SSL or agent options, see SSL and agentOptions requirements. Tip For a full list of supported request options, see request(options, callback) in the http-request documentation on GitHub. Here's an example of optional metadata in the options object: Using optional metadata //Declare optional metadata var options = { //Specify the endpoint URL url: 'https://api-endpoint.example.com', //Specify optional headers headers: { 'Endpoint-Key': 'uqNTC57Phe72pnnB8JuJmwAr7b09nKSKSz', 'Additional-Header': 'Additional-Header-Data' } }; Copy For SSL and agentOptions: If you are setting SSL options or providing an agentOptions object, the agent property in the request options object will need to be set to $globalAgents.https or $globalAgents.http to ensure your HTTP requests use the instrumented global agent. Here's an example of using a SSL option or agentOptions: Using a SSL option or agentOptions This example uses agentOptions: //Declare optional metadata var options = { //Specify the endpoint URL url: 'https://api-endpoint.example.com', //Specify optional headers headers: { 'Endpoint-Key': 'uqNTC57Phe72pnnB8JuJmwAr7b09nKSKSz', 'Additional-Header': 'Additional-Header-Data' } //Specify global agent as the http agent agent: $globalAgents.https, //Set SSL option strictSSL: true, //Specify http agent options agentOptions: { ​maxVersion: 'TLSv1.1' }, }; Copy Send a GET request To make a GET request, use the $http.get method to submit your request. Define your request options, make your request using $http.get, then validate the response to ensure your endpoint is returning the correct results. Insights GET example This example queries the Insights API by using GET: //Define your authentication credentials var myAccountID = '{YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID}'; var myQueryKey = '{YOUR_QUERY_KEY}'; var options = { //Define endpoint URI uri: 'https://insights-api.newrelic.com/v1/accounts/'+myAccountID+'/query?nrql=SELECT%20average(amount)%20FROM%20SyntheticsEvent', //Define query key and expected data type. headers: { 'X-Query-Key': myQueryKey, 'Accept': 'application/json' } }; //Define expected results using callback function. function callback (err, response, body){ //Log JSON results from endpoint to Synthetics console. console.log(JSON.parse(body)); console.log('done with script'); } //Make GET request, passing in options and callback. $http.get(options,callback); Copy Send a POST request To make a POST request, use the $http.post method to submit your request. Define your request options, make your request using $http.post, then validate the response to ensure your endpoint is returning the correct results. Custom event POST example This example POSTs a custom event containing static integers to the Event API: //Define your authentication credentials. var myAccountID = '{YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID}'; var myLicenseKey = '{YOUR_LICENSE_KEY}'; //Import the 'assert' module to validate results. var assert = require('assert'); var options = { //Define endpoint URL. url: \"https://insights-collector.newrelic.com/v1/accounts/\"+myAccountID+\"/events\", //Define body of POST request. body: '[{\"eventType\":\"SyntheticsEvent\",\"integer1\":1000,\"integer2\":2000}]', //Define New Relic license key and expected data type. headers: { 'Api-Key': myLicenseKey, 'Content-Type': 'application/json' } }; //Define expected results using callback function. function callback(error, response, body) { //Log status code to Synthetics console. console.log(response.statusCode + \" status code\") //Verify endpoint returns 200 (OK) response code. assert.ok(response.statusCode == 200, 'Expected 200 OK response'); //Parse JSON received from Insights into variable. var info = JSON.parse(body); //Verify that `info` contains element named `success` with a value of `true`. assert.ok(info.success == true, 'Expected True results in Response Body, result was ' + info.success); //Log end of script. console.log(\"End reached\"); } //Make POST request, passing in options and callback. $http.post(options, callback); Copy Validate results To validate your results, import the assert module to define your test case. Call an assert method to validate your endpoint's response. If any assert functions fail, the entire monitor will be considered a failed check. This may trigger alert notifications and affect your metrics. Important Synthetic monitoring does not allow thrown exceptions. Thrown exceptions result in script failure. Use the assert module to validate your results, and use console.log() to log results to the synthetic's console. Event API validation example This example POSTs to the Event API, then validates that the response is {\"success\":true}: //Define your authentication credentials. var myAccountID = '{YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID}'; var myLicenseKey = '{YOUR_LICENSE_KEY}'; //Import the `assert` module to validate results. var assert = require('assert'); var options = { //Define endpoint URL. url: \"https://insights-collector.newrelic.com/v1/accounts/\"+myAccountID+\"/events\", //Define body of POST request. body: '[{\"eventType\":\"SyntheticsEvent\",\"integer1\":1000,\"integer2\":2000}]', //Define New Relic license key and expected data type. headers: { 'Api-Key': myLicenseKey, 'Content-Type': 'application/json' } }; $http.post(options, function(error, response, body) { //Log status code to Synthetics console. The status code is logged before the `assert` function, //because a failed assert function ends the script. console.log(response.statusCode + \" status code\") //Call `assert` method, expecting a `200` response code. //If assertion fails, log `Expected 200 OK response` as error message to Synthetics console. assert.ok(response.statusCode == 200, 'Expected 200 OK response'); var info = JSON.parse(body); //Call `assert` method, expecting body to return `{\"success\":true}`. //If assertion fails, log `Expected True results in Response Body,` plus results as error message to Synthetics console. assert.ok(info.success == true, 'Expected True results in Response Body, result was ' + info.success); }); Copy",

      "body": "This document is for synthetic monitor versions 0.4.x or lower. See also the documentation for Synthetic monitor versions 0.5 or higher. Overview Synthetic scripted browsers provide you access to the Selenium Webdriver APIs 2.47.0 via the variables $driver and $browser. In particular: $driver provides all the exports from the selenium-webdriver module (for example, ActionSequence, Button, By, WebElement, etc.). $browser is a synthetic-flavored instance of selenium-webdriver.WebDriver(): it exposes the main basic WebDriver APIs like get() and findElement(), as well as some synthetic custom APIs. This document describes the functions available for synthetic scripted browser monitors version 0.4.0 or lower. For the newest monitor documentation, see monitor version 0.5.0+ documentation. Other relevant documentation: For more on synthetic scripting, see Write scripted browsers. For example scripts, see Scripted browser examples. For more information about monitor versions and runtime differences, see Runtime environments. To view and share scripted browser examples, check out topics tagged synthetic-script in New Relic's Explorers Hub. Top-level functions: Build your script New Relic calls top-level functions directly from your $browser instance. These provide a wide range of functionality that covers many basic scriptable actions. Function Return value $browser.actions() Creates a new action sequence using this driver. For a list of available actions, see ActionSequence: Link multiple actions. void $browser.addHeader(headerKey: string, headerValue: string) Adds header headerKey with value headerValue to the runtime. void $browser.addHeaders(headers: ?) Adds a map of headers to the runtime. void $browser.deleteHeader(header: string) Deletes a specific header from the runtime. void $browser.deleteHeaders(header: [string]) Deletes all headers in argument from runtime. void $browser.addHostnameToBlacklist(hostname: string) Disallows a hostname. Allows use wildcards. void $browser.addHostnamesToBlacklist(hostnameArr: [string]) Disallows all hostnames in an array of arguments. Allows use wildcards. void $browser.addHostnameToWhitelist(hostname: string) Allows a hostname blocked by default in synthetic monitoring. void $browser.addHostnamesToWhitelist(hostnameArr: [string]) Allows all hostnames in argument. void $browser.deleteHostnameFromBlacklist(hostname: string) Removes a hostname from this browser instance's blacklist. void $browser.deleteHostnamesFromBlacklist(hostnameArr: [string]) Removes all hostnames in argument from the disallowed list. void $browser.deleteHostnameFromWhitelist(hostnameArr: [string]) Removes a hostname from this browser instance's allowed list. void $browser.deleteHostnamesFromWhitelist(hostnameArr: [string]) Removes all hostnames in argument from this browser instance's allowed list. void $browser.executeAsyncScript(script: ?, var_args: ?) Schedules a command to execute asynchronous JavaScript in the context of the currently selected frame or window. promise $browser.executeScript(script: ?, var_args: ?) Schedules a command to execute JavaScript in the context of the currently selected frame or window. promise $browser.findElement(locator: $driver.Locator) Schedule a command to find an element on the page. If not found, New Relic returns an error. WebElement $browser.findElements(locator: $driver.Locator) Schedule a command to search for multiple elements on the page. promise $browser.waitForAndFindElement(locator: $driver.Locator [, timeout: number) Schedule a command to wait for and find an element on the page, and another command to wait for it to be visible. If not found, New Relic returns an error. The timeout value is an optional one, and gets applied separately to both tasks of finding the element and waiting for its visibility. This means at worst case, this method can take up to twice the provided timeout value. The default timeout value is 1000 ms (1 second). promise $browser.get(url: string) Loads a webpage in a synthetic browser. promise $browser.getAllWindowHandles() Schedules a command to retrieve the current list of available window handles. promise $browser.getCapabilities() A promise that will resolve with the instance's capabilities. promise $browser.getCurrentUrl() Schedules a command to retrieve the URL of the current page. promise $browser.getHeaders() Returns a map of currently configured headers. map $browser.getPageSource() Schedules a command to retrieve the current page's source. The page source returned is a representation of the underlying DOM; do not expect it to be formatted or escaped in the same way as the response sent from the web server. promise $browser.getSession() A promise for this client's session. promise $browser.getTitle() Schedules a command to retrieve the current page's title. promise $browser.getWindowHandle() Schedules a command to retrieve the current window handle. promise $browser.isElementPresent(locatorOrElement: $driver.Locator) Schedules a command to test if an element is present on the page. If given a DOM element, this function will check if it belongs to the document the driver is currently focused on. Otherwise, the function will test if at least one element can be found with the given search criteria. promise $browser.manage() The options interface for this instance. You can manage cookies, timeouts, and other window options. void $browser.navigate() The navigation interface (history of browser functions) for this instance. void $browser.schedule(command: ?, description: string) Schedules a command to be executed by this driver's CommandExecutor. promise $browser.sleep() Schedules a command to make the driver sleep for the given amount of time. promise $browser.switchTo() The target locator interface for this instance. void $browser.takeScreenshot() Schedule a command to take a screenshot. promise $browser.wait(fn: $driver.until.Condition, timeout: number, opt_message: string) Schedules a command to wait for a condition to hold, as defined by some user supplied function. webElement $browser.waitForPendingRequests(timeout: number) Causes the script to wait for requests that have been initiated to return, up to the timeout. Useful for tracking non-blocking resources. promise Disallow list: Wildcard use Disallowing domains for your browser instance requires wildcards to match the URL syntax of the URL to be blocked. An overall .com disallowed list needs to contain these functions: Function Blocking action $browser.addHostnameToBlacklist('*.com'); a.com $browser.addHostnameToBlacklist('*.*.com'); a.b.com $browser.addHostnameToBlacklist('*.*.*.com'); a.b.c.com $browser.addHostnameToBlacklist('www.*.com'); www.a.com $browser.addHostnameToBlacklist('www.*.*.com'); www.a.b.com $browser.addHostnameToBlacklist('www.*.*.*.com'); www.a.b.c.com Options: Manage the browser instance These functions manage options for your browser instance such as cookies, timeouts and window size. Access these options through the $browser.manage() function. Function Return value $browser.manage().addCookie(name: string, value: string, opt_path: string, opt_domain: string, opt_isSecure: boolean, opt_expiry: number) Schedules a command to add a cookie. promise $browser.manage().deleteAllCookies() Schedules a command to delete all cookies visible to the current page. promise $browser.manage().deleteCookie(name: string) Schedules a command to delete the cookie with the given name. This command is a no-op if there is no cookie with the given name visible to the current page. promise $browser.manage().getCookie(name: string) Schedules a command to retrieve the cookie with the given name. Returns null if there is no such cookie. The cookie will be returned as a JSON object as described by the WebDriver wire protocol. promise $browser.manage().getCookies() Schedules a command to retrieve all cookies visible to the current page. New Relic Syntheticcs returns each cookie as a JSON object as described by the WebDriver wire protocol. promise $browser.manage().timeouts().implicitlyWait(ms: number) Specifies the amount of time the driver should wait when searching for an element if it is not immediately present. Setting the wait timeout to 0 disables implicit waiting. Be careful increasing the wait timeout, as it will increase test run time, especially with slower location strategies like XPath. Default is 10 seconds. promise $browser.manage().timeouts().pageLoadTimeout(ms: number) Sets the amount of time to wait for a page load to complete before returning an error. If the timeout is negative, page loads may last up to 180 seconds. Default is 60 seconds. promise $browser.manage().timeouts().setScriptTimeout(ms: number) Sets the amount of time to wait, in milliseconds, for an asynchronous script to finish execution before returning an error. Default is 30 seconds. promise $browser.manage().window().getPosition() Retrieves the window's current position, relative to the top left corner of the screen. promise $browser.manage().window().getSize() Retrieves the window's current size. promise $browser.manage().window().maximize() Maximizes the current window. promise $browser.manage().window().setPosition(x: number, y: number) Repositions the current window. promise $browser.manage().window().setSize(width: number, height: number) Resizes the current window. promise Locators: Find page elements Locators are a collection of factory functions for creating locator instances. Locators find DOM elements, which can be passed to functions such as $browser.findElement or $browser.isElementPresent. Call them through $driver.By. Function Return value $driver.By.className(className: string) Locates an element that has a specific class name. The returned locator is equivalent to searching for elements with the CSS selector .clazz. locator $driver.By.css(cssName: string) Locates an element using a CSS selector. locator $driver.By.id(id: string) Locates an element by its ID. locator $driver.By.linkText(linkText: string) Locates link elements whose visible text matches the given string. locator $driver.By.js(js: string) Locates an element by evaluating a JavaScript expression. locator $driver.By.name(name: string) Locates elements whose name attribute has the given value. locator $driver.By.partialLinkText(partialLinkText: string) Locates link elements whose getText visible contains the given substring. locator $driver.By.tagName(tagName: string) Locates elements with a given tag name. The returned locator is equivalent to using the getElementsByTagName DOM function. locator $driver.By.xpath(xpath: string) Locates elements matching a XPath selector. locator WebElement: Interact with page elements When a function such as $browser.findElement or $browser.waitForAndFindElement returns a WebElement reference, these functions can be used to interact with that element. Using these, you can click on buttons, sent text to form inputs, and get attributes of elements to test. Function Return value click() Clicks on this element. void sendKeys(var_args: ?) Schedules a command to type a sequence on the DOM element represented by this instance. WebElement getTagName() Schedules a command to query for the tag/node name of this element. WebElement getCssValue(name: string) Schedules a command to query for the computed style of the element represented by this instance. If the element inherits the named style from its parent, the parent will be queried for its value. Where possible, color values will be converted to their hex representation (for example, #00ff00 instead of rgb(0, 255, 0)). promise getAttribute(name: string) Schedules a command to query for the value of the given attribute of the element. promise getText(name: string) Get the visible (not hidden by CSS) innerText of this element, including sub-elements, without any leading or trailing white space. promise getSize() Schedules a command to compute the size of this element's bounding box, in pixels. promise getLocation() Schedules a command to compute the location of this element, in page space. promise isEnabled() Schedules a command to query whether the DOM element represented by this instance is enabled, as dictated by the disabled attribute. promise isSelected() Schedules a command to query whether this element is selected. promise submit() Schedules a command to submit the form containing this element (or this element if it is a FORM element). This command is a no-op if the element is not contained in a form. promise clear() Schedules a command to clear the value of this element. promise isDisplayed() Schedules a command to test whether this element is currently displayed. promise getOuterHtml() Schedules a command to retrieve the outer HTML of this element. promise getInnerHtml() Schedules a command to retrieve the inner HTML of this element. promise ActionSequence: Link multiple actions Action sequences can create complex user interactions with your website. To create a new action sequence, use $browser.actions(). To link multiple actions together into a sequence, include perform() after each. This executes and then terminates individual sequences, including single-action sequences. The following table contains a list of available actions. For more information, see the WebDriver ActionSequence documentation. Function Return value click(opt_elementOrButton: ?, opt_button: ?) Clicks a mouse button. If an element is provided, the mouse will first be moved to the center of that element. This is equivalent to WebElement.click(). actionsequence doubleClick(opt_elementOrButton: ?, opt_button: ?) Double-clicks a mouse button. If an element is provided, the mouse will first be moved to the center of that element. actionsequence dragAndDrop(element: ?, location: ?) Convenience function for performing a \"drag and drop\" maneuver. The target element may be moved to the location of another element, or by an offset (in pixels). The location is an object with two properties x and y: {x: x_offset, y: y_offset}. actionsequence keyDown(key: ?) Performs a modifier key press. Must be one of ALT, CONTROL, SHIFT, COMMAND, or META. The modifier key is not released until keyUp() or sendKeys() is called. The key press will be targeted at the currently focused element. actionsequence keyUp(key: ?) Performs a modifier key release. The release is targeted at the currently focused element. actionsequence mouseDown(opt_elementOrButton: ?, opt_button: ?) Presses a mouse button. The mouse button will not be released until mouseUp is called, regardless of whether that call is made in this sequence or another. The behavior for out-of-order events (such as calling mouseDown() or click() when the button is already held down) is undefined. actionsequence mouseUp(opt_elementOrButton: ?, opt_button: ?) Releases a mouse button. Behavior is undefined for calling this function without a previous call to mouseDown(). actionsequence mouseMove(location: ?, offset: ?) Moves the mouse. The location to move to may be specified in terms of the mouse's current location, an offset relative to the top-left corner of an element, or an element (in which case the middle of the element is used). actionsequence perform() Executes this action sequence. promise sendKeys(args: ?) Simulates typing multiple keys. Each modifier key encountered in the sequence will not be released until it is encountered again. All key events will be targeted at the currently focused element. For a full list of supported non-alphanumeric keys, see the WebDriver enum key documentation. actionsequence Promises: Link actions into sequences You can also execute functions directly on promises. Synthetic monitoring is a native Node.js environment and uses standard Node.js promises. These functions evaluate the status of promises, cancel them, and more. In particular, you can create sequences of actions with the then() function and its siblings, thenFinally() and thenCatch(). For more information, see Sequence actions. Function Return value cancel(string: reason) Cancels the computation of this promise's value, rejecting the promise in the process. This method is a no-op if the promise has already been resolved. void isPending() Whether this promise's value is still being computed. boolean then(opt_callback: fn(T: ?), opt_errback: fn()) Registers listeners for when this instance is resolved. This is the basic function used to link synchronous actions in your script. promise thenFinally(callback: fn()) Registers a listener to invoke when this promise is resolved, regardless of whether the promise's value was successfully computed. promise thenCatch(callback: fn()) Registers a listener for when this promise is rejected. promise Navigate: Move through browser history The $browser.navigate() function exposes a number of functions that allow you to move backwards and forwards through your browser history, refresh your page and navigate to new pages. Function Return value back() Move back by one step in the browser's history. void forward() Move forward by one step in the browser's history. void refresh() Refresh the current page. void to(string: url) Load a new webpage in the current browser window. $browser.navigate().to() is equivalent to $browser.get(). void Conditions: Pause and wait for conditions Used with $browser.wait, until pauses your script execution until the condition is matched. For more information on explicit and implicit waits, see the WebDriver documentation. For .wait and .until usage examples, see Webdriver.wait examples. The following are available functions for $driver.until.Condition: Function Return value ableToSwitchToFrame(frame: ?) Creates a condition that will wait until the input driver is able to switch to the designated frame. The target frame may be specified as: A numeric index into window.frames for the current frame A webdriver.WebElement, which must reference a FRAME or IFRAME element on the current page A locator which may be used to first locate a FRAME or IFRAME on the current page before attempting to switch to it Upon successful resolution of this condition, the driver will be left focused on the new frame. condition alertIsPresent() Creates a condition that waits for an alert to be opened. Upon success, the returned promise will be fulfilled with the handle for the opened alert. condition elementIsDisabled(element: $driver.WebElement) Creates a condition that will wait for the given element to be disabled. condition elementIsEnabled(element: $driver.WebElement) Creates a condition that will wait for the given element to be enabled. condition elementIsNotVisible(element: $driver.WebElement) Creates a condition that will wait for the given element to be in the DOM, yet not visible to the user. condition elementIsVisible(element: $driver.WebElement) Creates a condition that will wait for the given element to become visible. condition elementIsSelected(element: $driver.WebElement) Creates a condition that will wait for the given element to be selected. condition elementLocated(element: $driver.Locator) Creates a condition that will loop until an element is found with the given locator. condition elementsLocated(element: $driver.Locator) Creates a condition that will loop until at least one element is found with the given locator. condition elementTextContains(element: $driver.WebElement, substr: string) Creates a condition that will wait for the given element's visible text to contain the given substring. condition elementTextIs(element: $driver.WebElement, text: string) Case sensitive. Creates a condition that will wait for the given element's visible text to match the given text exactly. condition elementTextMatches(element: $driver.WebElement, regex: string) Creates a condition that will wait for the given element's visible text to match a regular expression. condition stalenessOf(element: $driver.WebElement) Creates a condition that will wait for the given element to become stale. An element is considered stale once it is removed from the DOM, or a new page has loaded. condition titleContains(substr: string) Creates a condition that will wait for the current page's title to contain the given substring. condition titleIs(title: string) Creates a condition that will wait for the current page's title to match the given value. condition titleMatches(regex: string) Creates a condition that will wait for the current page's title to match the given regular expression. condition For more help Additional documentation resources include: Writing scripted browsers (how to build WebDriverJS scripts for multi-step monitoring) Scripted browser examples (example code for scripted browsers, including comments, with examples like searching a website and waiting for results to load)",

      "body": "Read on to learn about synthetic monitoring's proxy settings and properties. Proxy settings API for scripted monitors Important You can set proxy server configuration for synthetic scripted monitors for monitor versions 0.4.0 or higher. The global object $network allows you to control the network configuration used by your synthetic scripted monitors. The following are applicable for both scripted browsers and API tests, unless otherwise stated. $network.setProxy(string or object PROXY URL) Sets a proxy server to be used for all per-URL requests (HTTP, HTTPS, and FTP). Additional notes: The port is optional. If not provided, it will be derived from the scheme. For example, for HTTP the port would be 80. The username and password are assumed to be the result of a call to encodeURIComponent(). Special characters like @ and : in the username and/or the password must be escaped. Returns This method returns a Promise that will resolve once the configuration has been applied. Parameters Parameter Data Type Description proxyURL | proxyUrlParsed String or Object The URL to connect to the proxy server. A string containing a proxyURL (for example, http://proxy_host:8888) or a plain object in the same format as defined by Node's url.parse(urlString) method. Examples An example of setting a proxy server with HTTP protocol on port 1234 with no authentication: $network.setProxy('http://host.com:1234') Copy An example of setting a proxy server with HTTP protocol with authentication credentials. $network.setProxy('http://proxyUsername:proxyPassword@proxyHost:1234') Copy $network.setProxyForHttp(string or object PROXY URL) Tip This call is exactly the same as the per-URL setProxy call, except that it applies to HTTP traffic. Sets a proxy server to be used for all HTTP requests. Additional notes: The port is optional. If not provided, it will be derived from the scheme. For example, for HTTP the port would be 80. The username and password are assumed to be the result of a call to encodeURIComponent(). Special characters like @ and : in the username and/or the password must be escaped. Returns This method returns a Promise that will resolve once the configuration has been applied. Parameters Parameter Data Type Description proxyURL | proxyUrlParsed String or Object The URL to connect to the proxy server. A string containing a proxyURL (for example, http://proxy_host:8888) or a plain object in the same format as defined by Node's url.parse(urlString) method. Examples An example of setting a proxy server with HTTP protocol on port 1234 with no authentication: $network.setProxyForHttp('http://host.com:1234') Copy An example of setting a proxy server with HTTP protocol with authentication credentials. $network.setProxyForHttp('http://proxyUsername:proxyPassword@proxyHost:1234') Copy $network.setProxyForHttps(string or object PROXY URL) Tip This call is exactly the same as the per-URL setProxy call, except that it applies to HTTPS traffic. Sets a proxy server to be used for all HTTPS requests. Additional notes: The port is optional. If not provided, it will be derived from the scheme. For example, for HTTP the default port would be 443. The username and password are assumed to be the result of a call to encodeURIComponent(). Special characters like @ and : in the username and/or the password must be escaped. Returns This method returns a Promise that will resolve once the configuration has been applied. Parameters Parameter Data Type Description proxyURL | proxyUrlParsed String or Object The URL to connect to the proxy server. A string containing a proxyURL (for example, http://proxy_host:8888) or a plain object in the same format as defined by Node's url.parse(urlString) method. Examples An example of setting a proxy server with HTTPS protocol on port 1234 with no authentication: $network.setProxyForHttps('https://host.com:1234') Copy An example of setting a proxy server with HTTPS protocol with authentication credentials. $network.setProxyForHttps('https://proxyUsername:proxyPassword@proxyHost:1234') Copy $network.setProxyPAC(string PAC SCRIPT URL, object AUTH OBJECT) Sets a proxy server via a proxy auto-config (PAC) script and returns a promise. This function is only available for scripted browser monitors. Returns This method returns a Promise that will resolve once the configuration has been applied. Parameters Parameter Data Type Description scriptURL String The URL of the PAC script. authCredentialsMap Object Map of authentication credentials to be provided to the proxy server(s), keyed by the hostnames of the proxy server. Values of this map must be defined in the format {username: 'authUsername', password: 'authPassword'} Examples An example of setting a proxy server via a proxy auto-config (PAC) script: var authCredentialsMap = { 'example.com': {username: 'authUsername', password: 'authPassword'}, } Copy $network.setProxyAdvanced(object PROXY RULES OBJECT) Tip This method is Chrome-specific: it only applies to scripted browser monitor types. It can be used to allow for a more flexible and complex proxy configuration. In most cases, this method will not be needed. Sets the proxy configuration using the format supported by Chrome Extension API for Proxying. The input is a ProxyRules object, as defined by the Chrome Extension API to configures proxies. You can add authCredentials for proxies that need it. See Parameters for more details. Returns This method returns a Promise that will resolve once the configuration has been applied. Parameters Parameter Data Type Description ProxyRules Object Object The proxyRulesObject is a plain object that follows the format ProxyRules as defined by the Chrome Extension API to configures proxies. This object is \"flavoured\" to fit our runtime: users can define an additional property, authCredentials, for the Proxy server objects to provide authentication credentials for a specific proxy server. authCredentials is an object in the format {username: 'authUsername', password: 'authPassword'}. Examples Here's an example of creating a proxyRules with authCredentials: var proxyRules = { singleProxy: { host:\"example.com\", authCredentials: { username: 'authUsername', password: 'authPassword' } } }; Copy Here's an example of setting up a proxied network with mixed network zone assets: var proxyRules = {singleProxy: {host:\"http://entproxy.mycompany.com\"}, bypassList:['s3.amazonaws.com','*.localcdn.com'] } $network.setProxyAdvanced(proxyRules) Copy $network.clearProxy() Clears/removes the current proxy configuration. Returns This method returns a Promise that will resolve once the configuration has been applied. $network.getProxy() This method returns the current proxy configuration. It must be synchronized in a promise callback. Examples An example of synchronizing getProxy with $network.setProxy(); and $network.clearProxy();: var assert = require('assert'); $network.setProxy(\"http://user:password@myproxyurl.com\") .then(function () { console.log('Proxy configuration applied'); //Note: $network.getProxy() is not synchronized with the webdriver Control Flow. //To make sure we get the proxy configuration after the call to setProxy() above // succeeds we need to use a promise callback var proxyData = $network.getProxy(); console.log(proxyData); }) .then(function () { // Again: getProxy() is not synchronized with the Webdriver Control Flow: we //need this promise callback otherwise clearProxy() might be called before the call // to getProxy() above returns return $network.clearProxy(); }) .then(function () { console.log('Proxy configuration cleared'); // We need this promise callback for reasons explained above var proxyData = $network.getProxy(); assert.equal(proxyData.rules, null); }); Copy Proxy properties Important This proxy information applies only to these versions: API monitors: 0.4.0, 0.2.2, 0.2.1, 0.1.0 Scripted monitors: 0.1.0 In order to analyze and collect your HTTP traffic metrics, New Relic must ensure the traffic passes through a conceptual funnel. Our synthetic monitoring includes a software funnel component capable of analyzing the HTTP requests or responses and then recording the information. New Relic's scripted browser monitors (versions 0.4.x and lower) include a mechanism to do this analysis without needing an HTTP proxy, so you don't have to configure anything. New Relic's API test (versions 0.4.x and lower) provides an $http object that is pre-configured to make the requests pass through the internal HTTP proxy. This allows you to write your test without including any proxy settings. If you want to use some other way to generate HTTP traffic while still collecting the HTTP traffic metrics, you can use $env.PROXY_HOST and $env.PROXY_PORT. To record traffic metrics, be sure to include these properties in your script.

You can also view SLA reports for individual monitors: Go to one.newrelic.com > Synthetics > (select a monitor) > SLA. one.newrelic.com > Synthetics > SLA Report: Use SLA reports to understand your monitors' performance over time. Understand SLA report metrics Use SLA reports to view aggregated performance metrics for a single monitor, or for all your monitors from the account-wide SLA Reports page. SLA reports include the following metrics: Duration: The average duration across all monitor results. Uptime: The percentage of all monitor results that ended successfully. For example, Monitor A might check 50 times per day, and Monitor B might check 150 times per day. If Monitor A has 29 successes out of 50 and Monitor B has 148 successes out of 150, the Uptime would be 88.5: (29+148)/(50+150)=88.5 For individual SLA reports, the uptime score only includes the selected monitor. Apdex: The average Apdex across all monitors. Monitors have a default Apdex T of 7 seconds, but you can customize Apdex T for individual monitors by editing their settings. Apdex F, which defines a frustrating result, is always four times Apdex T. For more information about Apdex, see Apdex: Measuring user satisfaction. For individual SLA reports, the Apdex score only includes the selected monitor. % Satisfied: The percentage of monitor results which complete in a \"satisfying\" time. A satisfying time is defined as a monitor result that completes in Apdex T or less. % Toleration: The percentage of monitor results which complete in a \"tolerable\" time. A tolerable time is greater than Apdex T, but less than Apdex F (four times Apdex T). % Frustrated: The percentage of monitor results which complete in a \"frustrating\" time. A frustrating time is greater than Apdex F (four times Apdex T). The account-wide SLA report includes all monitor types (ping, simple browser, scripted browser, and API test).

      "body": "Use synthetic monitoring's API tests to monitor your API endpoint to ensure it is functioning correctly. New Relic uses the http-request module internally to make HTTP calls to your endpoint and validate the results. Here we present some example functions showing how to use the $http object to submit your request. For detailed documentation on the options available for this object, see the http-request readme. Tip To view and share other API test examples, visit the synthetics scripts section in Explorers Hub. Use API http-request module API tests are powered by the http-request module, which is available through the $http object. Once each frequency interval, New Relic queries your endpoint from each of your selected locations. For instructions on creating a monitor, see Adding monitors. Read on to learn how to define metadata for your request, make a GET request, make a POST request, and how to validate the results. Important After a maximum run time of three minutes, New Relic manually stops the script. one.newrelic.com > Synthetics > Create monitor: The script editor suggests functions, selectors, and other elements to simplify scripting commands (available in GitHub). Configure request options To start your script: Declare a variable (such as options) to store your request options object. Define request options such as the URL endpoint, and custom headers. If you're setting SSL or agent options, see SSL and agentOptions requirements. Tip For a full list of supported request options, see request(options, callback) in the http-request documentation on GitHub. Here's an example of optional metadata in the options object: Using optional metadata //Declare optional metadata var options = { //Specify the endpoint URL url: 'https://api-endpoint.example.com', //Specify optional headers headers: { 'Endpoint-Key': 'uqNTC57Phe72pnnB8JuJmwAr7b09nKSKSz', 'Additional-Header': 'Additional-Header-Data' } }; Copy For SSL and agentOptions: If you are setting SSL options or providing an agentOptions object, the agent property in the request options object will need to be set to $globalAgents.https or $globalAgents.http to ensure your HTTP requests use the instrumented global agent. Here's an example of using a SSL option or agentOptions: Using a SSL option or agentOptions This example uses agentOptions: //Declare optional metadata var options = { //Specify the endpoint URL url: 'https://api-endpoint.example.com', //Specify optional headers headers: { 'Endpoint-Key': 'uqNTC57Phe72pnnB8JuJmwAr7b09nKSKSz', 'Additional-Header': 'Additional-Header-Data' } //Specify global agent as the http agent agent: $globalAgents.https, //Set SSL option strictSSL: true, //Specify http agent options agentOptions: { ​maxVersion: 'TLSv1.1' }, }; Copy Send a GET request To make a GET request, use the $http.get method to submit your request. Define your request options, make your request using $http.get, then validate the response to ensure your endpoint is returning the correct results. Insights GET example This example queries the Insights API by using GET: //Define your authentication credentials var myAccountID = '{YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID}'; var myQueryKey = '{YOUR_QUERY_KEY}'; var options = { //Define endpoint URI uri: 'https://insights-api.newrelic.com/v1/accounts/'+myAccountID+'/query?nrql=SELECT%20average(amount)%20FROM%20SyntheticsEvent', //Define query key and expected data type. headers: { 'X-Query-Key': myQueryKey, 'Accept': 'application/json' } }; //Define expected results using callback function. function callback (err, response, body){ //Log JSON results from endpoint to Synthetics console. console.log(JSON.parse(body)); console.log('done with script'); } //Make GET request, passing in options and callback. $http.get(options,callback); Copy Send a POST request To make a POST request, use the $http.post method to submit your request. Define your request options, make your request using $http.post, then validate the response to ensure your endpoint is returning the correct results. Custom event POST example This example POSTs a custom event containing static integers to the Event API: //Define your authentication credentials. var myAccountID = '{YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID}'; var myLicenseKey = '{YOUR_LICENSE_KEY}'; //Import the 'assert' module to validate results. var assert = require('assert'); var options = { //Define endpoint URL. url: \"https://insights-collector.newrelic.com/v1/accounts/\"+myAccountID+\"/events\", //Define body of POST request. body: '[{\"eventType\":\"SyntheticsEvent\",\"integer1\":1000,\"integer2\":2000}]', //Define New Relic license key and expected data type. headers: { 'Api-Key': myLicenseKey, 'Content-Type': 'application/json' } }; //Define expected results using callback function. function callback(error, response, body) { //Log status code to Synthetics console. console.log(response.statusCode + \" status code\") //Verify endpoint returns 200 (OK) response code. assert.ok(response.statusCode == 200, 'Expected 200 OK response'); //Parse JSON received from Insights into variable. var info = JSON.parse(body); //Verify that `info` contains element named `success` with a value of `true`. assert.ok(info.success == true, 'Expected True results in Response Body, result was ' + info.success); //Log end of script. console.log(\"End reached\"); } //Make POST request, passing in options and callback. $http.post(options, callback); Copy Validate results To validate your results, import the assert module to define your test case. Call an assert method to validate your endpoint's response. If any assert functions fail, the entire monitor will be considered a failed check. This may trigger alert notifications and affect your metrics. Important Synthetic monitoring does not allow thrown exceptions. Thrown exceptions result in script failure. Use the assert module to validate your results, and use console.log() to log results to the synthetic's console. Event API validation example This example POSTs to the Event API, then validates that the response is {\"success\":true}: //Define your authentication credentials. var myAccountID = '{YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID}'; var myLicenseKey = '{YOUR_LICENSE_KEY}'; //Import the `assert` module to validate results. var assert = require('assert'); var options = { //Define endpoint URL. url: \"https://insights-collector.newrelic.com/v1/accounts/\"+myAccountID+\"/events\", //Define body of POST request. body: '[{\"eventType\":\"SyntheticsEvent\",\"integer1\":1000,\"integer2\":2000}]', //Define New Relic license key and expected data type. headers: { 'Api-Key': myLicenseKey, 'Content-Type': 'application/json' } }; $http.post(options, function(error, response, body) { //Log status code to Synthetics console. The status code is logged before the `assert` function, //because a failed assert function ends the script. console.log(response.statusCode + \" status code\") //Call `assert` method, expecting a `200` response code. //If assertion fails, log `Expected 200 OK response` as error message to Synthetics console. assert.ok(response.statusCode == 200, 'Expected 200 OK response'); var info = JSON.parse(body); //Call `assert` method, expecting body to return `{\"success\":true}`. //If assertion fails, log `Expected True results in Response Body,` plus results as error message to Synthetics console. assert.ok(info.success == true, 'Expected True results in Response Body, result was ' + info.success); }); Copy",

      "body": "Read on to learn about synthetic monitoring's proxy settings and properties. Proxy settings API for scripted monitors Important You can set proxy server configuration for synthetic scripted monitors for monitor versions 0.4.0 or higher. The global object $network allows you to control the network configuration used by your synthetic scripted monitors. The following are applicable for both scripted browsers and API tests, unless otherwise stated. $network.setProxy(string or object PROXY URL) Sets a proxy server to be used for all per-URL requests (HTTP, HTTPS, and FTP). Additional notes: The port is optional. If not provided, it will be derived from the scheme. For example, for HTTP the port would be 80. The username and password are assumed to be the result of a call to encodeURIComponent(). Special characters like @ and : in the username and/or the password must be escaped. Returns This method returns a Promise that will resolve once the configuration has been applied. Parameters Parameter Data Type Description proxyURL | proxyUrlParsed String or Object The URL to connect to the proxy server. A string containing a proxyURL (for example, http://proxy_host:8888) or a plain object in the same format as defined by Node's url.parse(urlString) method. Examples An example of setting a proxy server with HTTP protocol on port 1234 with no authentication: $network.setProxy('http://host.com:1234') Copy An example of setting a proxy server with HTTP protocol with authentication credentials. $network.setProxy('http://proxyUsername:proxyPassword@proxyHost:1234') Copy $network.setProxyForHttp(string or object PROXY URL) Tip This call is exactly the same as the per-URL setProxy call, except that it applies to HTTP traffic. Sets a proxy server to be used for all HTTP requests. Additional notes: The port is optional. If not provided, it will be derived from the scheme. For example, for HTTP the port would be 80. The username and password are assumed to be the result of a call to encodeURIComponent(). Special characters like @ and : in the username and/or the password must be escaped. Returns This method returns a Promise that will resolve once the configuration has been applied. Parameters Parameter Data Type Description proxyURL | proxyUrlParsed String or Object The URL to connect to the proxy server. A string containing a proxyURL (for example, http://proxy_host:8888) or a plain object in the same format as defined by Node's url.parse(urlString) method. Examples An example of setting a proxy server with HTTP protocol on port 1234 with no authentication: $network.setProxyForHttp('http://host.com:1234') Copy An example of setting a proxy server with HTTP protocol with authentication credentials. $network.setProxyForHttp('http://proxyUsername:proxyPassword@proxyHost:1234') Copy $network.setProxyForHttps(string or object PROXY URL) Tip This call is exactly the same as the per-URL setProxy call, except that it applies to HTTPS traffic. Sets a proxy server to be used for all HTTPS requests. Additional notes: The port is optional. If not provided, it will be derived from the scheme. For example, for HTTP the default port would be 443. The username and password are assumed to be the result of a call to encodeURIComponent(). Special characters like @ and : in the username and/or the password must be escaped. Returns This method returns a Promise that will resolve once the configuration has been applied. Parameters Parameter Data Type Description proxyURL | proxyUrlParsed String or Object The URL to connect to the proxy server. A string containing a proxyURL (for example, http://proxy_host:8888) or a plain object in the same format as defined by Node's url.parse(urlString) method. Examples An example of setting a proxy server with HTTPS protocol on port 1234 with no authentication: $network.setProxyForHttps('https://host.com:1234') Copy An example of setting a proxy server with HTTPS protocol with authentication credentials. $network.setProxyForHttps('https://proxyUsername:proxyPassword@proxyHost:1234') Copy $network.setProxyPAC(string PAC SCRIPT URL, object AUTH OBJECT) Sets a proxy server via a proxy auto-config (PAC) script and returns a promise. This function is only available for scripted browser monitors. Returns This method returns a Promise that will resolve once the configuration has been applied. Parameters Parameter Data Type Description scriptURL String The URL of the PAC script. authCredentialsMap Object Map of authentication credentials to be provided to the proxy server(s), keyed by the hostnames of the proxy server. Values of this map must be defined in the format {username: 'authUsername', password: 'authPassword'} Examples An example of setting a proxy server via a proxy auto-config (PAC) script: var authCredentialsMap = { 'example.com': {username: 'authUsername', password: 'authPassword'}, } Copy $network.setProxyAdvanced(object PROXY RULES OBJECT) Tip This method is Chrome-specific: it only applies to scripted browser monitor types. It can be used to allow for a more flexible and complex proxy configuration. In most cases, this method will not be needed. Sets the proxy configuration using the format supported by Chrome Extension API for Proxying. The input is a ProxyRules object, as defined by the Chrome Extension API to configures proxies. You can add authCredentials for proxies that need it. See Parameters for more details. Returns This method returns a Promise that will resolve once the configuration has been applied. Parameters Parameter Data Type Description ProxyRules Object Object The proxyRulesObject is a plain object that follows the format ProxyRules as defined by the Chrome Extension API to configures proxies. This object is \"flavoured\" to fit our runtime: users can define an additional property, authCredentials, for the Proxy server objects to provide authentication credentials for a specific proxy server. authCredentials is an object in the format {username: 'authUsername', password: 'authPassword'}. Examples Here's an example of creating a proxyRules with authCredentials: var proxyRules = { singleProxy: { host:\"example.com\", authCredentials: { username: 'authUsername', password: 'authPassword' } } }; Copy Here's an example of setting up a proxied network with mixed network zone assets: var proxyRules = {singleProxy: {host:\"http://entproxy.mycompany.com\"}, bypassList:['s3.amazonaws.com','*.localcdn.com'] } $network.setProxyAdvanced(proxyRules) Copy $network.clearProxy() Clears/removes the current proxy configuration. Returns This method returns a Promise that will resolve once the configuration has been applied. $network.getProxy() This method returns the current proxy configuration. It must be synchronized in a promise callback. Examples An example of synchronizing getProxy with $network.setProxy(); and $network.clearProxy();: var assert = require('assert'); $network.setProxy(\"http://user:password@myproxyurl.com\") .then(function () { console.log('Proxy configuration applied'); //Note: $network.getProxy() is not synchronized with the webdriver Control Flow. //To make sure we get the proxy configuration after the call to setProxy() above // succeeds we need to use a promise callback var proxyData = $network.getProxy(); console.log(proxyData); }) .then(function () { // Again: getProxy() is not synchronized with the Webdriver Control Flow: we //need this promise callback otherwise clearProxy() might be called before the call // to getProxy() above returns return $network.clearProxy(); }) .then(function () { console.log('Proxy configuration cleared'); // We need this promise callback for reasons explained above var proxyData = $network.getProxy(); assert.equal(proxyData.rules, null); }); Copy Proxy properties Important This proxy information applies only to these versions: API monitors: 0.4.0, 0.2.2, 0.2.1, 0.1.0 Scripted monitors: 0.1.0 In order to analyze and collect your HTTP traffic metrics, New Relic must ensure the traffic passes through a conceptual funnel. Our synthetic monitoring includes a software funnel component capable of analyzing the HTTP requests or responses and then recording the information. New Relic's scripted browser monitors (versions 0.4.x and lower) include a mechanism to do this analysis without needing an HTTP proxy, so you don't have to configure anything. New Relic's API test (versions 0.4.x and lower) provides an $http object that is pre-configured to make the requests pass through the internal HTTP proxy. This allows you to write your test without including any proxy settings. If you want to use some other way to generate HTTP traffic while still collecting the HTTP traffic metrics, you can use $env.PROXY_HOST and $env.PROXY_PORT. To record traffic metrics, be sure to include these properties in your script.

You can also view SLA reports for individual monitors: Go to one.newrelic.com > Synthetics > (select a monitor) > SLA. one.newrelic.com > Synthetics > SLA Report: Use SLA reports to understand your monitors' performance over time. Understand SLA report metrics Use SLA reports to view aggregated performance metrics for a single monitor, or for all your monitors from the account-wide SLA Reports page. SLA reports include the following metrics: Duration: The average duration across all monitor results. Uptime: The percentage of all monitor results that ended successfully. For example, Monitor A might check 50 times per day, and Monitor B might check 150 times per day. If Monitor A has 29 successes out of 50 and Monitor B has 148 successes out of 150, the Uptime would be 88.5: (29+148)/(50+150)=88.5 For individual SLA reports, the uptime score only includes the selected monitor. Apdex: The average Apdex across all monitors. Monitors have a default Apdex T of 7 seconds, but you can customize Apdex T for individual monitors by editing their settings. Apdex F, which defines a frustrating result, is always four times Apdex T. For more information about Apdex, see Apdex: Measuring user satisfaction. For individual SLA reports, the Apdex score only includes the selected monitor. % Satisfied: The percentage of monitor results which complete in a \"satisfying\" time. A satisfying time is defined as a monitor result that completes in Apdex T or less. % Toleration: The percentage of monitor results which complete in a \"tolerable\" time. A tolerable time is greater than Apdex T, but less than Apdex F (four times Apdex T). % Frustrated: The percentage of monitor results which complete in a \"frustrating\" time. A frustrating time is greater than Apdex F (four times Apdex T). The account-wide SLA report includes all monitor types (ping, simple browser, scripted browser, and API test).

      "body": "Use synthetic monitoring's API tests to monitor your API endpoint to ensure it is functioning correctly. New Relic uses the http-request module internally to make HTTP calls to your endpoint and validate the results. Here we present some example functions showing how to use the $http object to submit your request. For detailed documentation on the options available for this object, see the http-request readme. Tip To view and share other API test examples, visit the synthetics scripts section in Explorers Hub. Use API http-request module API tests are powered by the http-request module, which is available through the $http object. Once each frequency interval, New Relic queries your endpoint from each of your selected locations. For instructions on creating a monitor, see Adding monitors. Read on to learn how to define metadata for your request, make a GET request, make a POST request, and how to validate the results. Important After a maximum run time of three minutes, New Relic manually stops the script. one.newrelic.com > Synthetics > Create monitor: The script editor suggests functions, selectors, and other elements to simplify scripting commands (available in GitHub). Configure request options To start your script: Declare a variable (such as options) to store your request options object. Define request options such as the URL endpoint, and custom headers. If you're setting SSL or agent options, see SSL and agentOptions requirements. Tip For a full list of supported request options, see request(options, callback) in the http-request documentation on GitHub. Here's an example of optional metadata in the options object: Using optional metadata //Declare optional metadata var options = { //Specify the endpoint URL url: 'https://api-endpoint.example.com', //Specify optional headers headers: { 'Endpoint-Key': 'uqNTC57Phe72pnnB8JuJmwAr7b09nKSKSz', 'Additional-Header': 'Additional-Header-Data' } }; Copy For SSL and agentOptions: If you are setting SSL options or providing an agentOptions object, the agent property in the request options object will need to be set to $globalAgents.https or $globalAgents.http to ensure your HTTP requests use the instrumented global agent. Here's an example of using a SSL option or agentOptions: Using a SSL option or agentOptions This example uses agentOptions: //Declare optional metadata var options = { //Specify the endpoint URL url: 'https://api-endpoint.example.com', //Specify optional headers headers: { 'Endpoint-Key': 'uqNTC57Phe72pnnB8JuJmwAr7b09nKSKSz', 'Additional-Header': 'Additional-Header-Data' } //Specify global agent as the http agent agent: $globalAgents.https, //Set SSL option strictSSL: true, //Specify http agent options agentOptions: { ​maxVersion: 'TLSv1.1' }, }; Copy Send a GET request To make a GET request, use the $http.get method to submit your request. Define your request options, make your request using $http.get, then validate the response to ensure your endpoint is returning the correct results. Insights GET example This example queries the Insights API by using GET: //Define your authentication credentials var myAccountID = '{YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID}'; var myQueryKey = '{YOUR_QUERY_KEY}'; var options = { //Define endpoint URI uri: 'https://insights-api.newrelic.com/v1/accounts/'+myAccountID+'/query?nrql=SELECT%20average(amount)%20FROM%20SyntheticsEvent', //Define query key and expected data type. headers: { 'X-Query-Key': myQueryKey, 'Accept': 'application/json' } }; //Define expected results using callback function. function callback (err, response, body){ //Log JSON results from endpoint to Synthetics console. console.log(JSON.parse(body)); console.log('done with script'); } //Make GET request, passing in options and callback. $http.get(options,callback); Copy Send a POST request To make a POST request, use the $http.post method to submit your request. Define your request options, make your request using $http.post, then validate the response to ensure your endpoint is returning the correct results. Custom event POST example This example POSTs a custom event containing static integers to the Event API: //Define your authentication credentials. var myAccountID = '{YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID}'; var myLicenseKey = '{YOUR_LICENSE_KEY}'; //Import the 'assert' module to validate results. var assert = require('assert'); var options = { //Define endpoint URL. url: \"https://insights-collector.newrelic.com/v1/accounts/\"+myAccountID+\"/events\", //Define body of POST request. body: '[{\"eventType\":\"SyntheticsEvent\",\"integer1\":1000,\"integer2\":2000}]', //Define New Relic license key and expected data type. headers: { 'Api-Key': myLicenseKey, 'Content-Type': 'application/json' } }; //Define expected results using callback function. function callback(error, response, body) { //Log status code to Synthetics console. console.log(response.statusCode + \" status code\") //Verify endpoint returns 200 (OK) response code. assert.ok(response.statusCode == 200, 'Expected 200 OK response'); //Parse JSON received from Insights into variable. var info = JSON.parse(body); //Verify that `info` contains element named `success` with a value of `true`. assert.ok(info.success == true, 'Expected True results in Response Body, result was ' + info.success); //Log end of script. console.log(\"End reached\"); } //Make POST request, passing in options and callback. $http.post(options, callback); Copy Validate results To validate your results, import the assert module to define your test case. Call an assert method to validate your endpoint's response. If any assert functions fail, the entire monitor will be considered a failed check. This may trigger alert notifications and affect your metrics. Important Synthetic monitoring does not allow thrown exceptions. Thrown exceptions result in script failure. Use the assert module to validate your results, and use console.log() to log results to the synthetic's console. Event API validation example This example POSTs to the Event API, then validates that the response is {\"success\":true}: //Define your authentication credentials. var myAccountID = '{YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID}'; var myLicenseKey = '{YOUR_LICENSE_KEY}'; //Import the `assert` module to validate results. var assert = require('assert'); var options = { //Define endpoint URL. url: \"https://insights-collector.newrelic.com/v1/accounts/\"+myAccountID+\"/events\", //Define body of POST request. body: '[{\"eventType\":\"SyntheticsEvent\",\"integer1\":1000,\"integer2\":2000}]', //Define New Relic license key and expected data type. headers: { 'Api-Key': myLicenseKey, 'Content-Type': 'application/json' } }; $http.post(options, function(error, response, body) { //Log status code to Synthetics console. The status code is logged before the `assert` function, //because a failed assert function ends the script. console.log(response.statusCode + \" status code\") //Call `assert` method, expecting a `200` response code. //If assertion fails, log `Expected 200 OK response` as error message to Synthetics console. assert.ok(response.statusCode == 200, 'Expected 200 OK response'); var info = JSON.parse(body); //Call `assert` method, expecting body to return `{\"success\":true}`. //If assertion fails, log `Expected True results in Response Body,` plus results as error message to Synthetics console. assert.ok(info.success == true, 'Expected True results in Response Body, result was ' + info.success); }); Copy",

The username and password are assumed to be the result of a call to encodeURIComponent(). Special characters like @ and : in the username and/or the password must be escaped. Returns This method returns a Promise that will resolve once the configuration has been applied. Parameters Parameter Data Type Description proxyURL | proxyUrlParsed String or Object The URL to connect to the proxy server. A string containing a proxyURL (for example, http://proxy_host:8888) or a plain object in the same format as defined by Node's url.parse(urlString) method. Examples An example of setting a proxy server with HTTP protocol on port 1234 with no authentication: $network.setProxy('http://host.com:1234') Copy An example of setting a proxy server with HTTP protocol with authentication credentials. $network.setProxy('http://proxyUsername:proxyPassword@proxyHost:1234') Copy $network.setProxyForHttp(string or object PROXY URL) Tip This call is exactly the same as the per-URL setProxy call, except that it applies to HTTP traffic. Sets a proxy server to be used for all HTTP requests. Additional notes: The port is optional. If not provided, it will be derived from the scheme. For example, for HTTP the port would be 80. The username and password are assumed to be the result of a call to encodeURIComponent(). Special characters like @ and : in the username and/or the password must be escaped. Returns This method returns a Promise that will resolve once the configuration has been applied. Parameters Parameter Data Type Description proxyURL | proxyUrlParsed String or Object The URL to connect to the proxy server. A string containing a proxyURL (for example, http://proxy_host:8888) or a plain object in the same format as defined by Node's url.parse(urlString) method. Examples An example of setting a proxy server with HTTP protocol on port 1234 with no authentication: $network.setProxyForHttp('http://host.com:1234') Copy An example of setting a proxy server with HTTP protocol with authentication credentials. $network.setProxyForHttp('http://proxyUsername:proxyPassword@proxyHost:1234') Copy $network.setProxyForHttps(string or object PROXY URL) Tip This call is exactly the same as the per-URL setProxy call, except that it applies to HTTPS traffic. Sets a proxy server to be used for all HTTPS requests. Additional notes: The port is optional. If not provided, it will be derived from the scheme. For example, for HTTP the default port would be 443. The username and password are assumed to be the result of a call to encodeURIComponent(). Special characters like @ and : in the username and/or the password must be escaped. Returns This method returns a Promise that will resolve once the configuration has been applied. Parameters Parameter Data Type Description proxyURL | proxyUrlParsed String or Object The URL to connect to the proxy server. A string containing a proxyURL (for example, http://proxy_host:8888) or a plain object in the same format as defined by Node's url.parse(urlString) method. Examples An example of setting a proxy server with HTTPS protocol on port 1234 with no authentication: $network.setProxyForHttps('https://host.com:1234') Copy An example of setting a proxy server with HTTPS protocol with authentication credentials. $network.setProxyForHttps('https://proxyUsername:proxyPassword@proxyHost:1234') Copy $network.setProxyPAC(string PAC SCRIPT URL, object AUTH OBJECT) Sets a proxy server via a proxy auto-config (PAC) script and returns a promise. This function is only available for scripted browser monitors. Returns This method returns a Promise that will resolve once the configuration has been applied. Parameters Parameter Data Type Description scriptURL String The URL of the PAC script. authCredentialsMap Object Map of authentication credentials to be provided to the proxy server(s), keyed by the hostnames of the proxy server. Values of this map must be defined in the format {username: 'authUsername', password: 'authPassword'} Examples An example of setting a proxy server via a proxy auto-config (PAC) script: var authCredentialsMap = { 'example.com': {username: 'authUsername', password: 'authPassword'}, } Copy $network.setProxyAdvanced(object PROXY RULES OBJECT) Tip This method is Chrome-specific: it only applies to scripted browser monitor types. It can be used to allow for a more flexible and complex proxy configuration. In most cases, this method will not be needed. Sets the proxy configuration using the format supported by Chrome Extension API for Proxying. The input is a ProxyRules object, as defined by the Chrome Extension API to configures proxies. You can add authCredentials for proxies that need it. See Parameters for more details. Returns This method returns a Promise that will resolve once the configuration has been applied. Parameters Parameter Data Type Description ProxyRules Object Object The proxyRulesObject is a plain object that follows the format ProxyRules as defined by the Chrome Extension API to configures proxies. This object is \"flavoured\" to fit our runtime: users can define an additional property, authCredentials, for the Proxy server objects to provide authentication credentials for a specific proxy server. authCredentials is an object in the format {username: 'authUsername', password: 'authPassword'}. Examples Here's an example of creating a proxyRules with authCredentials: var proxyRules = { singleProxy: { host:\"example.com\", authCredentials: { username: 'authUsername', password: 'authPassword' } } }; Copy Here's an example of setting up a proxied network with mixed network zone assets: var proxyRules = {singleProxy: {host:\"http://entproxy.mycompany.com\"}, bypassList:['s3.amazonaws.com','*.localcdn.com'] } $network.setProxyAdvanced(proxyRules) Copy $network.clearProxy() Clears/removes the current proxy configuration. Returns This method returns a Promise that will resolve once the configuration has been applied. $network.getProxy() This method returns the current proxy configuration. It must be synchronized in a promise callback. Examples An example of synchronizing getProxy with $network.setProxy(); and $network.clearProxy();: var assert = require('assert'); $network.setProxy(\"http://user:password@myproxyurl.com\") .then(function () { console.log('Proxy configuration applied'); //Note: $network.getProxy() is not synchronized with the webdriver Control Flow. //To make sure we get the proxy configuration after the call to setProxy() above // succeeds we need to use a promise callback var proxyData = $network.getProxy(); console.log(proxyData); }) .then(function () { // Again: getProxy() is not synchronized with the Webdriver Control Flow: we //need this promise callback otherwise clearProxy() might be called before the call // to getProxy() above returns return $network.clearProxy(); }) .then(function () { console.log('Proxy configuration cleared'); // We need this promise callback for reasons explained above var proxyData = $network.getProxy(); assert.equal(proxyData.rules, null); }); Copy Proxy properties Important This proxy information applies only to these versions: API monitors: 0.4.0, 0.2.2, 0.2.1, 0.1.0 Scripted monitors: 0.1.0 In order to analyze and collect your HTTP traffic metrics, New Relic must ensure the traffic passes through a conceptual funnel. Our synthetic monitoring includes a software funnel component capable of analyzing the HTTP requests or responses and then recording the information. New Relic's scripted browser monitors (versions 0.4.x and lower) include a mechanism to do this analysis without needing an HTTP proxy, so you don't have to configure anything. New Relic's API test (versions 0.4.x and lower) provides an $http object that is pre-configured to make the requests pass through the internal HTTP proxy. This allows you to write your test without including any proxy settings. If you want to use some other way to generate HTTP traffic while still collecting the HTTP traffic metrics, you can use $env.PROXY_HOST and $env.PROXY_PORT. To record traffic metrics, be sure to include these properties in your script.

View synthetic monitoring SLA reports To view your account-wide SLA report: Go to one.newrelic.com > Synthetics > SLA Report. Choose from reports aggregated by day, week, or month by selecting Daily, Weekly, or Monthly as appropriate. You can also view SLA reports for individual monitors: Go to one.newrelic.com > Synthetics > (select a monitor) > SLA. one.newrelic.com > Synthetics > SLA Report: Use SLA reports to understand your monitors' performance over time. Understand SLA report metrics Use SLA reports to view aggregated performance metrics for a single monitor, or for all your monitors from the account-wide SLA Reports page. SLA reports include the following metrics: Duration: The average duration across all monitor results. Uptime: The percentage of all monitor results that ended successfully. For example, Monitor A might check 50 times per day, and Monitor B might check 150 times per day. If Monitor A has 29 successes out of 50 and Monitor B has 148 successes out of 150, the Uptime would be 88.5: (29+148)/(50+150)=88.5 For individual SLA reports, the uptime score only includes the selected monitor. Apdex: The average Apdex across all monitors. Monitors have a default Apdex T of 7 seconds, but you can customize Apdex T for individual monitors by editing their settings. Apdex F, which defines a frustrating result, is always four times Apdex T. For more information about Apdex, see Apdex: Measuring user satisfaction. For individual SLA reports, the Apdex score only includes the selected monitor. % Satisfied: The percentage of monitor results which complete in a \"satisfying\" time. A satisfying time is defined as a monitor result that completes in Apdex T or less. % Toleration: The percentage of monitor results which complete in a \"tolerable\" time. A tolerable time is greater than Apdex T, but less than Apdex F (four times Apdex T). % Frustrated: The percentage of monitor results which complete in a \"frustrating\" time. A frustrating time is greater than Apdex F (four times Apdex T). The account-wide SLA report includes all monitor types (ping, simple browser, scripted browser, and API test).

View the report in Excel or an external program Select Download this report as .csv to download a copy of your SLA data. Open the file in Excel, Google Drive, or another spreadsheet editor to analyze your data. Change your Apdex targets The default Apdex T for all monitors is 7 seconds. You can customize your Apdex T target for individual monitors by editing your monitor. Change the time frame Choose from daily, weekly, or monthly aggregation by selecting the appropriate tab. Make the report public Change the Public SLA setting to ON to allow non-authenticated users to view the report. Select Share Report to get the public URL to share. Generate SLA values The values in the SLA report are generated from Insights queries against the available synthetic monitoring data. You can easily recreate these values and modify the queries to meet your needs. This query returns the average duration, the apdex, and the uptime. Substitute your values for the variables highlighted and described below. SELECT average(duration), apdex(duration, t:), percentage(count(*), WHERE result='SUCCESS') FROM SyntheticCheck FACET timeperiod Copy Variable Value t: Supply the Apdex T that you would like to calculate your apdex against. The duration attribute in the SyntheticCheck event is stored in milliseconds, so an Apdex T value of 7 seconds should be included as 7000. timeperiod This is the period that you would like to calculate on. For a daily report, facet on dateOf(timestamp), for a weekly report facet on weekOf(timestamp) and for a monthly report facet on monthOf(timestamp).

      "body": "This document is for synthetic monitor versions 0.4.x or lower. See also the documentation for Synthetic monitor versions 0.5 or higher. Overview Synthetic scripted browsers provide you access to the Selenium Webdriver APIs 2.47.0 via the variables $driver and $browser. In particular: $driver provides all the exports from the selenium-webdriver module (for example, ActionSequence, Button, By, WebElement, etc.). $browser is a synthetic-flavored instance of selenium-webdriver.WebDriver(): it exposes the main basic WebDriver APIs like get() and findElement(), as well as some synthetic custom APIs. This document describes the functions available for synthetic scripted browser monitors version 0.4.0 or lower. For the newest monitor documentation, see monitor version 0.5.0+ documentation. Other relevant documentation: For more on synthetic scripting, see Write scripted browsers. For example scripts, see Scripted browser examples. For more information about monitor versions and runtime differences, see Runtime environments. To view and share scripted browser examples, check out topics tagged synthetic-script in New Relic's Explorers Hub. Top-level functions: Build your script New Relic calls top-level functions directly from your $browser instance. These provide a wide range of functionality that covers many basic scriptable actions. Function Return value $browser.actions() Creates a new action sequence using this driver. For a list of available actions, see ActionSequence: Link multiple actions. void $browser.addHeader(headerKey: string, headerValue: string) Adds header headerKey with value headerValue to the runtime. void $browser.addHeaders(headers: ?) Adds a map of headers to the runtime. void $browser.deleteHeader(header: string) Deletes a specific header from the runtime. void $browser.deleteHeaders(header: [string]) Deletes all headers in argument from runtime. void $browser.addHostnameToBlacklist(hostname: string) Disallows a hostname. Allows use wildcards. void $browser.addHostnamesToBlacklist(hostnameArr: [string]) Disallows all hostnames in an array of arguments. Allows use wildcards. void $browser.addHostnameToWhitelist(hostname: string) Allows a hostname blocked by default in synthetic monitoring. void $browser.addHostnamesToWhitelist(hostnameArr: [string]) Allows all hostnames in argument. void $browser.deleteHostnameFromBlacklist(hostname: string) Removes a hostname from this browser instance's blacklist. void $browser.deleteHostnamesFromBlacklist(hostnameArr: [string]) Removes all hostnames in argument from the disallowed list. void $browser.deleteHostnameFromWhitelist(hostnameArr: [string]) Removes a hostname from this browser instance's allowed list. void $browser.deleteHostnamesFromWhitelist(hostnameArr: [string]) Removes all hostnames in argument from this browser instance's allowed list. void $browser.executeAsyncScript(script: ?, var_args: ?) Schedules a command to execute asynchronous JavaScript in the context of the currently selected frame or window. promise $browser.executeScript(script: ?, var_args: ?) Schedules a command to execute JavaScript in the context of the currently selected frame or window. promise $browser.findElement(locator: $driver.Locator) Schedule a command to find an element on the page. If not found, New Relic returns an error. WebElement $browser.findElements(locator: $driver.Locator) Schedule a command to search for multiple elements on the page. promise $browser.waitForAndFindElement(locator: $driver.Locator [, timeout: number) Schedule a command to wait for and find an element on the page, and another command to wait for it to be visible. If not found, New Relic returns an error. The timeout value is an optional one, and gets applied separately to both tasks of finding the element and waiting for its visibility. This means at worst case, this method can take up to twice the provided timeout value. The default timeout value is 1000 ms (1 second). promise $browser.get(url: string) Loads a webpage in a synthetic browser. promise $browser.getAllWindowHandles() Schedules a command to retrieve the current list of available window handles. promise $browser.getCapabilities() A promise that will resolve with the instance's capabilities. promise $browser.getCurrentUrl() Schedules a command to retrieve the URL of the current page. promise $browser.getHeaders() Returns a map of currently configured headers. map $browser.getPageSource() Schedules a command to retrieve the current page's source. The page source returned is a representation of the underlying DOM; do not expect it to be formatted or escaped in the same way as the response sent from the web server. promise $browser.getSession() A promise for this client's session. promise $browser.getTitle() Schedules a command to retrieve the current page's title. promise $browser.getWindowHandle() Schedules a command to retrieve the current window handle. promise $browser.isElementPresent(locatorOrElement: $driver.Locator) Schedules a command to test if an element is present on the page. If given a DOM element, this function will check if it belongs to the document the driver is currently focused on. Otherwise, the function will test if at least one element can be found with the given search criteria. promise $browser.manage() The options interface for this instance. You can manage cookies, timeouts, and other window options. void $browser.navigate() The navigation interface (history of browser functions) for this instance. void $browser.schedule(command: ?, description: string) Schedules a command to be executed by this driver's CommandExecutor. promise $browser.sleep() Schedules a command to make the driver sleep for the given amount of time. promise $browser.switchTo() The target locator interface for this instance. void $browser.takeScreenshot() Schedule a command to take a screenshot. promise $browser.wait(fn: $driver.until.Condition, timeout: number, opt_message: string) Schedules a command to wait for a condition to hold, as defined by some user supplied function. webElement $browser.waitForPendingRequests(timeout: number) Causes the script to wait for requests that have been initiated to return, up to the timeout. Useful for tracking non-blocking resources. promise Disallow list: Wildcard use Disallowing domains for your browser instance requires wildcards to match the URL syntax of the URL to be blocked. An overall .com disallowed list needs to contain these functions: Function Blocking action $browser.addHostnameToBlacklist('*.com'); a.com $browser.addHostnameToBlacklist('*.*.com'); a.b.com $browser.addHostnameToBlacklist('*.*.*.com'); a.b.c.com $browser.addHostnameToBlacklist('www.*.com'); www.a.com $browser.addHostnameToBlacklist('www.*.*.com'); www.a.b.com $browser.addHostnameToBlacklist('www.*.*.*.com'); www.a.b.c.com Options: Manage the browser instance These functions manage options for your browser instance such as cookies, timeouts and window size. Access these options through the $browser.manage() function. Function Return value $browser.manage().addCookie(name: string, value: string, opt_path: string, opt_domain: string, opt_isSecure: boolean, opt_expiry: number) Schedules a command to add a cookie. promise $browser.manage().deleteAllCookies() Schedules a command to delete all cookies visible to the current page. promise $browser.manage().deleteCookie(name: string) Schedules a command to delete the cookie with the given name. This command is a no-op if there is no cookie with the given name visible to the current page. promise $browser.manage().getCookie(name: string) Schedules a command to retrieve the cookie with the given name. Returns null if there is no such cookie. The cookie will be returned as a JSON object as described by the WebDriver wire protocol. promise $browser.manage().getCookies() Schedules a command to retrieve all cookies visible to the current page. New Relic Syntheticcs returns each cookie as a JSON object as described by the WebDriver wire protocol. promise $browser.manage().timeouts().implicitlyWait(ms: number) Specifies the amount of time the driver should wait when searching for an element if it is not immediately present. Setting the wait timeout to 0 disables implicit waiting. Be careful increasing the wait timeout, as it will increase test run time, especially with slower location strategies like XPath. Default is 10 seconds. promise $browser.manage().timeouts().pageLoadTimeout(ms: number) Sets the amount of time to wait for a page load to complete before returning an error. If the timeout is negative, page loads may last up to 180 seconds. Default is 60 seconds. promise $browser.manage().timeouts().setScriptTimeout(ms: number) Sets the amount of time to wait, in milliseconds, for an asynchronous script to finish execution before returning an error. Default is 30 seconds. promise $browser.manage().window().getPosition() Retrieves the window's current position, relative to the top left corner of the screen. promise $browser.manage().window().getSize() Retrieves the window's current size. promise $browser.manage().window().maximize() Maximizes the current window. promise $browser.manage().window().setPosition(x: number, y: number) Repositions the current window. promise $browser.manage().window().setSize(width: number, height: number) Resizes the current window. promise Locators: Find page elements Locators are a collection of factory functions for creating locator instances. Locators find DOM elements, which can be passed to functions such as $browser.findElement or $browser.isElementPresent. Call them through $driver.By. Function Return value $driver.By.className(className: string) Locates an element that has a specific class name. The returned locator is equivalent to searching for elements with the CSS selector .clazz. locator $driver.By.css(cssName: string) Locates an element using a CSS selector. locator $driver.By.id(id: string) Locates an element by its ID. locator $driver.By.linkText(linkText: string) Locates link elements whose visible text matches the given string. locator $driver.By.js(js: string) Locates an element by evaluating a JavaScript expression. locator $driver.By.name(name: string) Locates elements whose name attribute has the given value. locator $driver.By.partialLinkText(partialLinkText: string) Locates link elements whose getText visible contains the given substring. locator $driver.By.tagName(tagName: string) Locates elements with a given tag name. The returned locator is equivalent to using the getElementsByTagName DOM function. locator $driver.By.xpath(xpath: string) Locates elements matching a XPath selector. locator WebElement: Interact with page elements When a function such as $browser.findElement or $browser.waitForAndFindElement returns a WebElement reference, these functions can be used to interact with that element. Using these, you can click on buttons, sent text to form inputs, and get attributes of elements to test. Function Return value click() Clicks on this element. void sendKeys(var_args: ?) Schedules a command to type a sequence on the DOM element represented by this instance. WebElement getTagName() Schedules a command to query for the tag/node name of this element. WebElement getCssValue(name: string) Schedules a command to query for the computed style of the element represented by this instance. If the element inherits the named style from its parent, the parent will be queried for its value. Where possible, color values will be converted to their hex representation (for example, #00ff00 instead of rgb(0, 255, 0)). promise getAttribute(name: string) Schedules a command to query for the value of the given attribute of the element. promise getText(name: string) Get the visible (not hidden by CSS) innerText of this element, including sub-elements, without any leading or trailing white space. promise getSize() Schedules a command to compute the size of this element's bounding box, in pixels. promise getLocation() Schedules a command to compute the location of this element, in page space. promise isEnabled() Schedules a command to query whether the DOM element represented by this instance is enabled, as dictated by the disabled attribute. promise isSelected() Schedules a command to query whether this element is selected. promise submit() Schedules a command to submit the form containing this element (or this element if it is a FORM element). This command is a no-op if the element is not contained in a form. promise clear() Schedules a command to clear the value of this element. promise isDisplayed() Schedules a command to test whether this element is currently displayed. promise getOuterHtml() Schedules a command to retrieve the outer HTML of this element. promise getInnerHtml() Schedules a command to retrieve the inner HTML of this element. promise ActionSequence: Link multiple actions Action sequences can create complex user interactions with your website. To create a new action sequence, use $browser.actions(). To link multiple actions together into a sequence, include perform() after each. This executes and then terminates individual sequences, including single-action sequences. The following table contains a list of available actions. For more information, see the WebDriver ActionSequence documentation. Function Return value click(opt_elementOrButton: ?, opt_button: ?) Clicks a mouse button. If an element is provided, the mouse will first be moved to the center of that element. This is equivalent to WebElement.click(). actionsequence doubleClick(opt_elementOrButton: ?, opt_button: ?) Double-clicks a mouse button. If an element is provided, the mouse will first be moved to the center of that element. actionsequence dragAndDrop(element: ?, location: ?) Convenience function for performing a \"drag and drop\" maneuver. The target element may be moved to the location of another element, or by an offset (in pixels). The location is an object with two properties x and y: {x: x_offset, y: y_offset}. actionsequence keyDown(key: ?) Performs a modifier key press. Must be one of ALT, CONTROL, SHIFT, COMMAND, or META. The modifier key is not released until keyUp() or sendKeys() is called. The key press will be targeted at the currently focused element. actionsequence keyUp(key: ?) Performs a modifier key release. The release is targeted at the currently focused element. actionsequence mouseDown(opt_elementOrButton: ?, opt_button: ?) Presses a mouse button. The mouse button will not be released until mouseUp is called, regardless of whether that call is made in this sequence or another. The behavior for out-of-order events (such as calling mouseDown() or click() when the button is already held down) is undefined. actionsequence mouseUp(opt_elementOrButton: ?, opt_button: ?) Releases a mouse button. Behavior is undefined for calling this function without a previous call to mouseDown(). actionsequence mouseMove(location: ?, offset: ?) Moves the mouse. The location to move to may be specified in terms of the mouse's current location, an offset relative to the top-left corner of an element, or an element (in which case the middle of the element is used). actionsequence perform() Executes this action sequence. promise sendKeys(args: ?) Simulates typing multiple keys. Each modifier key encountered in the sequence will not be released until it is encountered again. All key events will be targeted at the currently focused element. For a full list of supported non-alphanumeric keys, see the WebDriver enum key documentation. actionsequence Promises: Link actions into sequences You can also execute functions directly on promises. Synthetic monitoring is a native Node.js environment and uses standard Node.js promises. These functions evaluate the status of promises, cancel them, and more. In particular, you can create sequences of actions with the then() function and its siblings, thenFinally() and thenCatch(). For more information, see Sequence actions. Function Return value cancel(string: reason) Cancels the computation of this promise's value, rejecting the promise in the process. This method is a no-op if the promise has already been resolved. void isPending() Whether this promise's value is still being computed. boolean then(opt_callback: fn(T: ?), opt_errback: fn()) Registers listeners for when this instance is resolved. This is the basic function used to link synchronous actions in your script. promise thenFinally(callback: fn()) Registers a listener to invoke when this promise is resolved, regardless of whether the promise's value was successfully computed. promise thenCatch(callback: fn()) Registers a listener for when this promise is rejected. promise Navigate: Move through browser history The $browser.navigate() function exposes a number of functions that allow you to move backwards and forwards through your browser history, refresh your page and navigate to new pages. Function Return value back() Move back by one step in the browser's history. void forward() Move forward by one step in the browser's history. void refresh() Refresh the current page. void to(string: url) Load a new webpage in the current browser window. $browser.navigate().to() is equivalent to $browser.get(). void Conditions: Pause and wait for conditions Used with $browser.wait, until pauses your script execution until the condition is matched. For more information on explicit and implicit waits, see the WebDriver documentation. For .wait and .until usage examples, see Webdriver.wait examples. The following are available functions for $driver.until.Condition: Function Return value ableToSwitchToFrame(frame: ?) Creates a condition that will wait until the input driver is able to switch to the designated frame. The target frame may be specified as: A numeric index into window.frames for the current frame A webdriver.WebElement, which must reference a FRAME or IFRAME element on the current page A locator which may be used to first locate a FRAME or IFRAME on the current page before attempting to switch to it Upon successful resolution of this condition, the driver will be left focused on the new frame. condition alertIsPresent() Creates a condition that waits for an alert to be opened. Upon success, the returned promise will be fulfilled with the handle for the opened alert. condition elementIsDisabled(element: $driver.WebElement) Creates a condition that will wait for the given element to be disabled. condition elementIsEnabled(element: $driver.WebElement) Creates a condition that will wait for the given element to be enabled. condition elementIsNotVisible(element: $driver.WebElement) Creates a condition that will wait for the given element to be in the DOM, yet not visible to the user. condition elementIsVisible(element: $driver.WebElement) Creates a condition that will wait for the given element to become visible. condition elementIsSelected(element: $driver.WebElement) Creates a condition that will wait for the given element to be selected. condition elementLocated(element: $driver.Locator) Creates a condition that will loop until an element is found with the given locator. condition elementsLocated(element: $driver.Locator) Creates a condition that will loop until at least one element is found with the given locator. condition elementTextContains(element: $driver.WebElement, substr: string) Creates a condition that will wait for the given element's visible text to contain the given substring. condition elementTextIs(element: $driver.WebElement, text: string) Case sensitive. Creates a condition that will wait for the given element's visible text to match the given text exactly. condition elementTextMatches(element: $driver.WebElement, regex: string) Creates a condition that will wait for the given element's visible text to match a regular expression. condition stalenessOf(element: $driver.WebElement) Creates a condition that will wait for the given element to become stale. An element is considered stale once it is removed from the DOM, or a new page has loaded. condition titleContains(substr: string) Creates a condition that will wait for the current page's title to contain the given substring. condition titleIs(title: string) Creates a condition that will wait for the current page's title to match the given value. condition titleMatches(regex: string) Creates a condition that will wait for the current page's title to match the given regular expression. condition For more help Additional documentation resources include: Writing scripted browsers (how to build WebDriverJS scripts for multi-step monitoring) Scripted browser examples (example code for scripted browsers, including comments, with examples like searching a website and waiting for results to load)",

Understand SLA report metrics Use SLA reports to view aggregated performance metrics for a single monitor, or for all your monitors from the account-wide SLA Reports page. SLA reports include the following metrics: Duration: The average duration across all monitor results. Uptime: The percentage of all monitor results that ended successfully. For example, Monitor A might check 50 times per day, and Monitor B might check 150 times per day. If Monitor A has 29 successes out of 50 and Monitor B has 148 successes out of 150, the Uptime would be 88.5: (29+148)/(50+150)=88.5 For individual SLA reports, the uptime score only includes the selected monitor. Apdex: The average Apdex across all monitors. Monitors have a default Apdex T of 7 seconds, but you can customize Apdex T for individual monitors by editing their settings. Apdex F, which defines a frustrating result, is always four times Apdex T. For more information about Apdex, see Apdex: Measuring user satisfaction. For individual SLA reports, the Apdex score only includes the selected monitor. % Satisfied: The percentage of monitor results which complete in a \"satisfying\" time. A satisfying time is defined as a monitor result that completes in Apdex T or less. % Toleration: The percentage of monitor results which complete in a \"tolerable\" time. A tolerable time is greater than Apdex T, but less than Apdex F (four times Apdex T). % Frustrated: The percentage of monitor results which complete in a \"frustrating\" time. A frustrating time is greater than Apdex F (four times Apdex T). The account-wide SLA report includes all monitor types (ping, simple browser, scripted browser, and API test).

      "body": "Read on to learn about synthetic monitoring's proxy settings and properties. Proxy settings API for scripted monitors Important You can set proxy server configuration for synthetic scripted monitors for monitor versions 0.4.0 or higher. The global object $network allows you to control the network configuration used by your synthetic scripted monitors. The following are applicable for both scripted browsers and API tests, unless otherwise stated. $network.setProxy(string or object PROXY URL) Sets a proxy server to be used for all per-URL requests (HTTP, HTTPS, and FTP). Additional notes: The port is optional. If not provided, it will be derived from the scheme. For example, for HTTP the port would be 80. The username and password are assumed to be the result of a call to encodeURIComponent(). Special characters like @ and : in the username and/or the password must be escaped. Returns This method returns a Promise that will resolve once the configuration has been applied. Parameters Parameter Data Type Description proxyURL | proxyUrlParsed String or Object The URL to connect to the proxy server. A string containing a proxyURL (for example, http://proxy_host:8888) or a plain object in the same format as defined by Node's url.parse(urlString) method. Examples An example of setting a proxy server with HTTP protocol on port 1234 with no authentication: $network.setProxy('http://host.com:1234') Copy An example of setting a proxy server with HTTP protocol with authentication credentials. $network.setProxy('http://proxyUsername:proxyPassword@proxyHost:1234') Copy $network.setProxyForHttp(string or object PROXY URL) Tip This call is exactly the same as the per-URL setProxy call, except that it applies to HTTP traffic. Sets a proxy server to be used for all HTTP requests. Additional notes: The port is optional. If not provided, it will be derived from the scheme. For example, for HTTP the port would be 80. The username and password are assumed to be the result of a call to encodeURIComponent(). Special characters like @ and : in the username and/or the password must be escaped. Returns This method returns a Promise that will resolve once the configuration has been applied. Parameters Parameter Data Type Description proxyURL | proxyUrlParsed String or Object The URL to connect to the proxy server. A string containing a proxyURL (for example, http://proxy_host:8888) or a plain object in the same format as defined by Node's url.parse(urlString) method. Examples An example of setting a proxy server with HTTP protocol on port 1234 with no authentication: $network.setProxyForHttp('http://host.com:1234') Copy An example of setting a proxy server with HTTP protocol with authentication credentials. $network.setProxyForHttp('http://proxyUsername:proxyPassword@proxyHost:1234') Copy $network.setProxyForHttps(string or object PROXY URL) Tip This call is exactly the same as the per-URL setProxy call, except that it applies to HTTPS traffic. Sets a proxy server to be used for all HTTPS requests. Additional notes: The port is optional. If not provided, it will be derived from the scheme. For example, for HTTP the default port would be 443. The username and password are assumed to be the result of a call to encodeURIComponent(). Special characters like @ and : in the username and/or the password must be escaped. Returns This method returns a Promise that will resolve once the configuration has been applied. Parameters Parameter Data Type Description proxyURL | proxyUrlParsed String or Object The URL to connect to the proxy server. A string containing a proxyURL (for example, http://proxy_host:8888) or a plain object in the same format as defined by Node's url.parse(urlString) method. Examples An example of setting a proxy server with HTTPS protocol on port 1234 with no authentication: $network.setProxyForHttps('https://host.com:1234') Copy An example of setting a proxy server with HTTPS protocol with authentication credentials. $network.setProxyForHttps('https://proxyUsername:proxyPassword@proxyHost:1234') Copy $network.setProxyPAC(string PAC SCRIPT URL, object AUTH OBJECT) Sets a proxy server via a proxy auto-config (PAC) script and returns a promise. This function is only available for scripted browser monitors. Returns This method returns a Promise that will resolve once the configuration has been applied. Parameters Parameter Data Type Description scriptURL String The URL of the PAC script. authCredentialsMap Object Map of authentication credentials to be provided to the proxy server(s), keyed by the hostnames of the proxy server. Values of this map must be defined in the format {username: 'authUsername', password: 'authPassword'} Examples An example of setting a proxy server via a proxy auto-config (PAC) script: var authCredentialsMap = { 'example.com': {username: 'authUsername', password: 'authPassword'}, } Copy $network.setProxyAdvanced(object PROXY RULES OBJECT) Tip This method is Chrome-specific: it only applies to scripted browser monitor types. It can be used to allow for a more flexible and complex proxy configuration. In most cases, this method will not be needed. Sets the proxy configuration using the format supported by Chrome Extension API for Proxying. The input is a ProxyRules object, as defined by the Chrome Extension API to configures proxies. You can add authCredentials for proxies that need it. See Parameters for more details. Returns This method returns a Promise that will resolve once the configuration has been applied. Parameters Parameter Data Type Description ProxyRules Object Object The proxyRulesObject is a plain object that follows the format ProxyRules as defined by the Chrome Extension API to configures proxies. This object is \"flavoured\" to fit our runtime: users can define an additional property, authCredentials, for the Proxy server objects to provide authentication credentials for a specific proxy server. authCredentials is an object in the format {username: 'authUsername', password: 'authPassword'}. Examples Here's an example of creating a proxyRules with authCredentials: var proxyRules = { singleProxy: { host:\"example.com\", authCredentials: { username: 'authUsername', password: 'authPassword' } } }; Copy Here's an example of setting up a proxied network with mixed network zone assets: var proxyRules = {singleProxy: {host:\"http://entproxy.mycompany.com\"}, bypassList:['s3.amazonaws.com','*.localcdn.com'] } $network.setProxyAdvanced(proxyRules) Copy $network.clearProxy() Clears/removes the current proxy configuration. Returns This method returns a Promise that will resolve once the configuration has been applied. $network.getProxy() This method returns the current proxy configuration. It must be synchronized in a promise callback. Examples An example of synchronizing getProxy with $network.setProxy(); and $network.clearProxy();: var assert = require('assert'); $network.setProxy(\"http://user:password@myproxyurl.com\") .then(function () { console.log('Proxy configuration applied'); //Note: $network.getProxy() is not synchronized with the webdriver Control Flow. //To make sure we get the proxy configuration after the call to setProxy() above // succeeds we need to use a promise callback var proxyData = $network.getProxy(); console.log(proxyData); }) .then(function () { // Again: getProxy() is not synchronized with the Webdriver Control Flow: we //need this promise callback otherwise clearProxy() might be called before the call // to getProxy() above returns return $network.clearProxy(); }) .then(function () { console.log('Proxy configuration cleared'); // We need this promise callback for reasons explained above var proxyData = $network.getProxy(); assert.equal(proxyData.rules, null); }); Copy Proxy properties Important This proxy information applies only to these versions: API monitors: 0.4.0, 0.2.2, 0.2.1, 0.1.0 Scripted monitors: 0.1.0 In order to analyze and collect your HTTP traffic metrics, New Relic must ensure the traffic passes through a conceptual funnel. Our synthetic monitoring includes a software funnel component capable of analyzing the HTTP requests or responses and then recording the information. New Relic's scripted browser monitors (versions 0.4.x and lower) include a mechanism to do this analysis without needing an HTTP proxy, so you don't have to configure anything. New Relic's API test (versions 0.4.x and lower) provides an $http object that is pre-configured to make the requests pass through the internal HTTP proxy. This allows you to write your test without including any proxy settings. If you want to use some other way to generate HTTP traffic while still collecting the HTTP traffic metrics, you can use $env.PROXY_HOST and $env.PROXY_PORT. To record traffic metrics, be sure to include these properties in your script.

      "body": "Problem Your New Relic's synthetic Simple, Scripted, or Scripted API (non-ping) monitor reported an error, but the application appears to have loaded correctly. For ping and simple monitor errors, see non-scripted monitor errors. Solutions Below are some of the most common non-ping monitor error messages. Simple or scripted browser errors Element A is not clickable at point (X, Y). Other element would receive the click: Element B Problem The synthetic script is attempting to .click() an element (Element A) at point (X,Y), but another element (Element B) is obscuring the target element. Solution Set a custom wait time, allowing time for a specific condition to be met. In this case, until the loading animation is no longer visible: .then(function() { return $browser.wait($driver.until.elementIsNotVisible($browser.findElement($driver.By.id('LOADING'))), 10000); }) Copy Alternatively, you can set a custom sleep delay using $browser.sleep(sleeptime_ms), stalling script execution for a specified amount of time. As this is a fixed amount of wait-time, which does not account for increased network latency or degraded site performance, we recommend using the .wait() function instead. Tip This will not correct .click() issues caused by sticky headers or footers. In these instances, you may need to scroll manually to bring the target into view. Cause This happens if the target element, at the time of the .click() function, is obscured by: A loading overlay, modal, or pop-up An animation that reveals the target element A sticky header or footer Error: element not visible Problem The targeted element is not visible to the Selenium WebDriver. Solution Verify that the targeted element does not have the CSS properties of display: none or visibility: hidden applied. Cause Any element that has a CSS property of display: none or visibility: hidden will not be found by the Selenium WebDriver, as the script will only look for elements that are actually visible to a user. Error: no such element: Unable to locate element: <LOCATOR> Problem The Selenium WebDriver was unable to find this element in the visible DOM. Solution To resolve this problem: Confirm that the element locator being used for the target element is accurate. Avoid using By.XPath where possible as it is rigidly tied to the page’s DOM structure, and can easily become out-of-date when there are updates on the page. If element is in an iframe, use $browser.switchTo().frame(<index or element reference>. Tip See the Selenium documentation for more information on switchTo() and TargetLocator() functions. Cause Common reasons for this error include: The targeted element is unable to be located by functions such as: $browser.findElement(locator: $driver.Locator) or $browser.waitForAndFindElement(locator: $driver.Locator [ , timeout: number This may be due to a timing issue. For example, the WebDriver is attempting to locate the element before the page has been loaded. Element is in an iframe, which is a separate document context. JobTimeoutError: Job timed-out after 180s Problem The scripted monitor run reached the 180 second non-configurable timeout threshold, and the run was terminated. Solution If this is a frequent error, consider breaking up the scripted tasks into a separate scripted monitors. If it appears that a specific task is causing the job to wait an unacceptable amount of time, consider changing the method by which you’re accomplishing that task. For example, changing $browser.findElement(locator: $driver.Locator) to $browser.waitForAndFindElement(locator: $driver.Locator [, timeout: number) would assign the task its own configurable timeout. If you have multiple steps where the $browser.waitForAndFindElement(locator, timeout) function is called, ensure that the the sum of the provided timeouts to these steps does not exceed 180 seconds. If you’re finding it difficult to accomplish this, then that is a sign that the monitor should probably be broken up into separate monitor scripts. Cause All synthetic scripted monitors have a non-configurable maximum global 180s timeout for running a script. If a script has not completed after 180 seconds, the job is terminated. If this happens consistently it could be a sign of a script that is taking too long to complete, or that the job is waiting an extended period of time while attempting to perform a scripted task. NetworkError: Monitor produced no traffic Problem The API test or scripted browser monitor appears to be running but is returning this error. Solution Ensure that $http.get() or $browser.get() are being called appropriately and are generating traffic. For Scripted API monitors, if you are using a request option to spin up an un-instrumented HTTP agent under the hood, specify one of our instrumented HTTP agents using either of the agent request options below: $globalAgents.http $globalAgents.https Example: var options = { uri: 'https://www.newrelic.com', agent: $globalAgents.https, agentOptions: { 'rejectUnauthorized': false }, strictSSL: false }; function callback(err, res, body) { ... }; $http.get(options, callback); Copy Cause This occurs in scripted monitor runs when the HTTP client ($http in scripted api monitors) or Chrome browser ($browser in scripted browser monitors) is not used to generate HTTP traffic. In some cases, certain request options in API monitors may force a new HTTP agent, one that is not instrumented by synthetic monitoring, to be used to collect HTTP traffic. ReferenceError: $network is not defined Problem The $network object used for setting monitor proxies is not available for that monitor’s runtime. Solution If your monitor was created before the 0.4.0 runtime release, create a new monitor to take advantage of the latest runtime. Your monitor’s current runtime version is shown at the top of the monitor's settings. For more information, see Scripted monitor version runtime environments. Cause This error occurs when attempting to use $network on a monitor with a runtime at or below 0.2.2. Proxying monitor traffic was introduced in monitor runtime version 0.4.0, causing this method to be evaluated as undefined on earlier monitor runtimes. ScriptTimeoutError Problem This error indicates that the job has reached the Docker container timeout threshold, and the script was terminated. Solution If this is a frequent error, consider breaking up the scripted tasks into a separate scripted monitors. If it appears that a specific task is causing the job to wait an unacceptable amount of time, consider changing the method by which you’re accomplishing that task. For example, changing $browser.findElement(locator: $driver.Locator) to $browser.waitForAndFindElement(locator: $driver.Locator [, timeout: number) would assigned the task its own configurable timeout. If you have multiple steps where the $browser.waitForAndFindElement(locator, timeout) function is called, ensure that the the sum of the provided timeouts to these steps does not exceed 180 seconds. If you’re finding it difficult to accomplish this, then that is a sign that the monitor should probably be broken up into separate monitor scripts. Cause All synthetic scripted monitors have a non-configurable maximum global 180s timeout for running a script. If a script has not completed after 180 seconds, the job is terminated. If this happens consistently it could be a sign of a script that is taking too long to complete, or that the job is waiting an extended period of time while attempting to perform a scripted task. StaleElementReferenceError: element is not attached to the page document Problem The target page has loaded, but there was a change to an element between the execution of an element locator and an action being executed on the element. Solution Set your scripted browser to wait until the page is settled before performing a findElement() action. This can be accomplished by setting a custom wait time, using the $browser.wait(fn, timeout) function prior to the findElement call, to wait for a condition that indicates a settled page state. This will make it less likely for DOM manipulation to cause a reference to go stale. Alternatively, you can set a custom sleep delay using $browser.sleep(sleeptime_ms), stalling script execution for a specified amount of time. As this is a fixed amount of wait-time, which does not account for increased network latency or degraded site performance, we recommend using the .wait() function instead. Cause This error typically happens when the script attempts to .click() an element after using either the findElement() or waitForAndFindElement() function. If the DOM has changed between when the element locator was generated and the action was executed against the element, this error will occur because the actual element has changed. For example: the findElement() function is used to generate an element reference while the page’s script is actively manipulating the DOM. The DOM is then changed, causing the previously generated reference to become stale. The now out-of-date reference is used in an attempt to perform a .click() action, resulting in this monitor failure. Tip For more information, see the Selenium documentation on Stale Element Reference Exceptions. TaskTimedOut: task timed-out waiting for element to be located using: <LOCATOR> Problem The waitForAndFindElement(<locator>, <timeout>) function failed to locate an element within the provided timeout. Solution Confirm that the element locator being used for the target element is accurate. Avoid using By.XPath() where possible, as it is rigidly tied to the page’s DOM structure and can easily become out-of-date when there are updates on the page. Cause The target element did not exist on the page when the waitForAndFindElement(<locator>, <timeout>) function was called. This may be caused by the target page not being in the expected state. Common reasons for this error include: There is a legitimate issue with the target site. The element locator being used is incorrect. The target site has changed, requiring the revision of the Synthetics script. The previous action in the script did not successfully complete, causing the page to be in an unexpected state when the subsequent waitForAndFindElement() call was initiated. TimeoutError: Page load timed-out (unable to finish all network requests on time) Problem The target page loaded successfully, but returned the error: TimeoutError: Page load timed-out (unable to finish all network requests on time) Solution If the failures began suddenly, investigate any requests that could be blocking or delaying the page load event. If you are unsure which request is causing the error, use the timeline view to identify any long running HTTP requests. If the page is frequently unable to fully load within the current timeout, set a custom page load timeout using the $browser.manage().timeouts().pageLoadTimeout(ms: number) function. Cause The target page loaded successfully, but the page load event was not fired within the page load timeout set in the .pageLoadTimeout() function. There are a number of reasons you could see this error message, including: A blocked resource request on the page held up the page load. A resource request processed slower than normal due to an underlying network issue. A dependent resource on the page blocked the iframe load event. TypeError: $browser.isElementPresent is not a function Problem The function isElementPresent(), used by Synthetics monitors with a runtime >= 0.5.0, has been deprecated in Selenium 3. Solution To continue to use this function after depreciation you will need to create a custom version of this function, such as: return $browser.findElements(ele).then(function(found) { return found.length > 0; }); } Copy Example usage, which would return true: $browser .get(\"https://www.newrelic.com\") .then(function() { return isElementPresent($driver.By.id(\"nav_signup\")); }) .then(function(found) { return console.log(found); }); Copy Cause This can occur when attempting to use a scripted browser monitor script from an older monitor ( < = 0.4.1 runtime) with a newer monitor ( >= 0.5.0) runtime. Scripted API monitor errors JobTimeoutError: Job timed-out after 180s Problem The scripted monitor run reached the 180 second non-configurable timeout threshold, and the run was terminated.

SyntaxError: Unexpected token < Problem JSON.parse() was passed a string that begins with the < character and is likely HTML, instead of JSON. Solution Ensure the target endpoint is returning the expected response body. You can do this by logging the response body in the callback, before attempting to parse. Example: $http.get('http://www.newrelic.com', function(error, response, body) { if (error) { throw new Error(error); } console.log(body); // Log HTML response body, don't parse as JSON }); Copy Depending on the target API endpoint, you may need to include specific request headers to ensure that JSON is returned. Cause The script is attempting to use JSON.parse() on a response body after a request is made and is expecting the endpoint to return JSON, but HTML was returned instead. SyntaxError: Unexpected token u in JSON at position 0 Problem JSON.parse() was passed an undefined parameter, but expected a JSON string. Solution Troubleshoot the cause of the request error. Details on what is causing request errors can be found in the error object passed to the request callback function. Example: $http.get('http://www.newrelic.com', function(error, response, body) { if (error) { throw new Error(error); } var bodyJson = JSON.parse(body); console.log(bodyJson); // Log response body }); Copy Cause This can occur in Scripted API monitors when a performing an API request, then attempting to parse the request response within the callback function. The response body is passed to JSON.parse() without checking if the response body is undefined first. An undefined response body is often caused by a request error. If there is no error handling to prevent code that parses the response body, this monitor failure will occur. TypeError: Cannot read property 'statusCode' of undefined Problem The response object (and thus response.statusCode) in an API request callback is undefined. Solution Troubleshoot the cause of the request error. Details on what is causing request errors can be found in the error object passed to the request callback function. Example: $http.get('http://www.newrelic.com', function(error, response, body) { if (error) { throw new Error(error); } console.log(response.statusCode); }); Copy Cause This error occurs when there was an error completing the API request (for example, unable to reach server, unable to resolve DNS). In these instances, the request was not completed so the response object in the callback function arguments is undefined. If there is no error handling to prevent code that checks response status code, this monitor failure will occur.",

SLA reports include the following metrics: Duration: The average duration across all monitor results. Uptime: The percentage of all monitor results that ended successfully. For example, Monitor A might check 50 times per day, and Monitor B might check 150 times per day. If Monitor A has 29 successes out of 50 and Monitor B has 148 successes out of 150, the Uptime would be 88.5: (29+148)/(50+150)=88.5 For individual SLA reports, the uptime score only includes the selected monitor. Apdex: The average Apdex across all monitors. Monitors have a default Apdex T of 7 seconds, but you can customize Apdex T for individual monitors by editing their settings.

      "body": "Read on to learn about synthetic monitoring's proxy settings and properties. Proxy settings API for scripted monitors Important You can set proxy server configuration for synthetic scripted monitors for monitor versions 0.4.0 or higher. The global object $network allows you to control the network configuration used by your synthetic scripted monitors. The following are applicable for both scripted browsers and API tests, unless otherwise stated. $network.setProxy(string or object PROXY URL) Sets a proxy server to be used for all per-URL requests (HTTP, HTTPS, and FTP). Additional notes: The port is optional. If not provided, it will be derived from the scheme. For example, for HTTP the port would be 80. The username and password are assumed to be the result of a call to encodeURIComponent(). Special characters like @ and : in the username and/or the password must be escaped. Returns This method returns a Promise that will resolve once the configuration has been applied. Parameters Parameter Data Type Description proxyURL | proxyUrlParsed String or Object The URL to connect to the proxy server. A string containing a proxyURL (for example, http://proxy_host:8888) or a plain object in the same format as defined by Node's url.parse(urlString) method. Examples An example of setting a proxy server with HTTP protocol on port 1234 with no authentication: $network.setProxy('http://host.com:1234') Copy An example of setting a proxy server with HTTP protocol with authentication credentials. $network.setProxy('http://proxyUsername:proxyPassword@proxyHost:1234') Copy $network.setProxyForHttp(string or object PROXY URL) Tip This call is exactly the same as the per-URL setProxy call, except that it applies to HTTP traffic. Sets a proxy server to be used for all HTTP requests. Additional notes: The port is optional. If not provided, it will be derived from the scheme. For example, for HTTP the port would be 80. The username and password are assumed to be the result of a call to encodeURIComponent(). Special characters like @ and : in the username and/or the password must be escaped. Returns This method returns a Promise that will resolve once the configuration has been applied. Parameters Parameter Data Type Description proxyURL | proxyUrlParsed String or Object The URL to connect to the proxy server. A string containing a proxyURL (for example, http://proxy_host:8888) or a plain object in the same format as defined by Node's url.parse(urlString) method. Examples An example of setting a proxy server with HTTP protocol on port 1234 with no authentication: $network.setProxyForHttp('http://host.com:1234') Copy An example of setting a proxy server with HTTP protocol with authentication credentials. $network.setProxyForHttp('http://proxyUsername:proxyPassword@proxyHost:1234') Copy $network.setProxyForHttps(string or object PROXY URL) Tip This call is exactly the same as the per-URL setProxy call, except that it applies to HTTPS traffic. Sets a proxy server to be used for all HTTPS requests. Additional notes: The port is optional. If not provided, it will be derived from the scheme. For example, for HTTP the default port would be 443. The username and password are assumed to be the result of a call to encodeURIComponent(). Special characters like @ and : in the username and/or the password must be escaped. Returns This method returns a Promise that will resolve once the configuration has been applied. Parameters Parameter Data Type Description proxyURL | proxyUrlParsed String or Object The URL to connect to the proxy server. A string containing a proxyURL (for example, http://proxy_host:8888) or a plain object in the same format as defined by Node's url.parse(urlString) method. Examples An example of setting a proxy server with HTTPS protocol on port 1234 with no authentication: $network.setProxyForHttps('https://host.com:1234') Copy An example of setting a proxy server with HTTPS protocol with authentication credentials. $network.setProxyForHttps('https://proxyUsername:proxyPassword@proxyHost:1234') Copy $network.setProxyPAC(string PAC SCRIPT URL, object AUTH OBJECT) Sets a proxy server via a proxy auto-config (PAC) script and returns a promise. This function is only available for scripted browser monitors. Returns This method returns a Promise that will resolve once the configuration has been applied. Parameters Parameter Data Type Description scriptURL String The URL of the PAC script. authCredentialsMap Object Map of authentication credentials to be provided to the proxy server(s), keyed by the hostnames of the proxy server. Values of this map must be defined in the format {username: 'authUsername', password: 'authPassword'} Examples An example of setting a proxy server via a proxy auto-config (PAC) script: var authCredentialsMap = { 'example.com': {username: 'authUsername', password: 'authPassword'}, } Copy $network.setProxyAdvanced(object PROXY RULES OBJECT) Tip This method is Chrome-specific: it only applies to scripted browser monitor types. It can be used to allow for a more flexible and complex proxy configuration. In most cases, this method will not be needed. Sets the proxy configuration using the format supported by Chrome Extension API for Proxying. The input is a ProxyRules object, as defined by the Chrome Extension API to configures proxies. You can add authCredentials for proxies that need it. See Parameters for more details. Returns This method returns a Promise that will resolve once the configuration has been applied. Parameters Parameter Data Type Description ProxyRules Object Object The proxyRulesObject is a plain object that follows the format ProxyRules as defined by the Chrome Extension API to configures proxies. This object is \"flavoured\" to fit our runtime: users can define an additional property, authCredentials, for the Proxy server objects to provide authentication credentials for a specific proxy server. authCredentials is an object in the format {username: 'authUsername', password: 'authPassword'}. Examples Here's an example of creating a proxyRules with authCredentials: var proxyRules = { singleProxy: { host:\"example.com\", authCredentials: { username: 'authUsername', password: 'authPassword' } } }; Copy Here's an example of setting up a proxied network with mixed network zone assets: var proxyRules = {singleProxy: {host:\"http://entproxy.mycompany.com\"}, bypassList:['s3.amazonaws.com','*.localcdn.com'] } $network.setProxyAdvanced(proxyRules) Copy $network.clearProxy() Clears/removes the current proxy configuration. Returns This method returns a Promise that will resolve once the configuration has been applied. $network.getProxy() This method returns the current proxy configuration. It must be synchronized in a promise callback. Examples An example of synchronizing getProxy with $network.setProxy(); and $network.clearProxy();: var assert = require('assert'); $network.setProxy(\"http://user:password@myproxyurl.com\") .then(function () { console.log('Proxy configuration applied'); //Note: $network.getProxy() is not synchronized with the webdriver Control Flow. //To make sure we get the proxy configuration after the call to setProxy() above // succeeds we need to use a promise callback var proxyData = $network.getProxy(); console.log(proxyData); }) .then(function () { // Again: getProxy() is not synchronized with the Webdriver Control Flow: we //need this promise callback otherwise clearProxy() might be called before the call // to getProxy() above returns return $network.clearProxy(); }) .then(function () { console.log('Proxy configuration cleared'); // We need this promise callback for reasons explained above var proxyData = $network.getProxy(); assert.equal(proxyData.rules, null); }); Copy Proxy properties Important This proxy information applies only to these versions: API monitors: 0.4.0, 0.2.2, 0.2.1, 0.1.0 Scripted monitors: 0.1.0 In order to analyze and collect your HTTP traffic metrics, New Relic must ensure the traffic passes through a conceptual funnel. Our synthetic monitoring includes a software funnel component capable of analyzing the HTTP requests or responses and then recording the information. New Relic's scripted browser monitors (versions 0.4.x and lower) include a mechanism to do this analysis without needing an HTTP proxy, so you don't have to configure anything. New Relic's API test (versions 0.4.x and lower) provides an $http object that is pre-configured to make the requests pass through the internal HTTP proxy. This allows you to write your test without including any proxy settings. If you want to use some other way to generate HTTP traffic while still collecting the HTTP traffic metrics, you can use $env.PROXY_HOST and $env.PROXY_PORT. To record traffic metrics, be sure to include these properties in your script.

      "body": "Problem Your New Relic's synthetic Simple, Scripted, or Scripted API (non-ping) monitor reported an error, but the application appears to have loaded correctly. For ping and simple monitor errors, see non-scripted monitor errors. Solutions Below are some of the most common non-ping monitor error messages. Simple or scripted browser errors Element A is not clickable at point (X, Y). Other element would receive the click: Element B Problem The synthetic script is attempting to .click() an element (Element A) at point (X,Y), but another element (Element B) is obscuring the target element. Solution Set a custom wait time, allowing time for a specific condition to be met. In this case, until the loading animation is no longer visible: .then(function() { return $browser.wait($driver.until.elementIsNotVisible($browser.findElement($driver.By.id('LOADING'))), 10000); }) Copy Alternatively, you can set a custom sleep delay using $browser.sleep(sleeptime_ms), stalling script execution for a specified amount of time. As this is a fixed amount of wait-time, which does not account for increased network latency or degraded site performance, we recommend using the .wait() function instead. Tip This will not correct .click() issues caused by sticky headers or footers. In these instances, you may need to scroll manually to bring the target into view. Cause This happens if the target element, at the time of the .click() function, is obscured by: A loading overlay, modal, or pop-up An animation that reveals the target element A sticky header or footer Error: element not visible Problem The targeted element is not visible to the Selenium WebDriver. Solution Verify that the targeted element does not have the CSS properties of display: none or visibility: hidden applied. Cause Any element that has a CSS property of display: none or visibility: hidden will not be found by the Selenium WebDriver, as the script will only look for elements that are actually visible to a user. Error: no such element: Unable to locate element: <LOCATOR> Problem The Selenium WebDriver was unable to find this element in the visible DOM. Solution To resolve this problem: Confirm that the element locator being used for the target element is accurate. Avoid using By.XPath where possible as it is rigidly tied to the page’s DOM structure, and can easily become out-of-date when there are updates on the page. If element is in an iframe, use $browser.switchTo().frame(<index or element reference>. Tip See the Selenium documentation for more information on switchTo() and TargetLocator() functions. Cause Common reasons for this error include: The targeted element is unable to be located by functions such as: $browser.findElement(locator: $driver.Locator) or $browser.waitForAndFindElement(locator: $driver.Locator [ , timeout: number This may be due to a timing issue. For example, the WebDriver is attempting to locate the element before the page has been loaded. Element is in an iframe, which is a separate document context. JobTimeoutError: Job timed-out after 180s Problem The scripted monitor run reached the 180 second non-configurable timeout threshold, and the run was terminated. Solution If this is a frequent error, consider breaking up the scripted tasks into a separate scripted monitors. If it appears that a specific task is causing the job to wait an unacceptable amount of time, consider changing the method by which you’re accomplishing that task. For example, changing $browser.findElement(locator: $driver.Locator) to $browser.waitForAndFindElement(locator: $driver.Locator [, timeout: number) would assign the task its own configurable timeout. If you have multiple steps where the $browser.waitForAndFindElement(locator, timeout) function is called, ensure that the the sum of the provided timeouts to these steps does not exceed 180 seconds. If you’re finding it difficult to accomplish this, then that is a sign that the monitor should probably be broken up into separate monitor scripts. Cause All synthetic scripted monitors have a non-configurable maximum global 180s timeout for running a script. If a script has not completed after 180 seconds, the job is terminated. If this happens consistently it could be a sign of a script that is taking too long to complete, or that the job is waiting an extended period of time while attempting to perform a scripted task. NetworkError: Monitor produced no traffic Problem The API test or scripted browser monitor appears to be running but is returning this error. Solution Ensure that $http.get() or $browser.get() are being called appropriately and are generating traffic. For Scripted API monitors, if you are using a request option to spin up an un-instrumented HTTP agent under the hood, specify one of our instrumented HTTP agents using either of the agent request options below: $globalAgents.http $globalAgents.https Example: var options = { uri: 'https://www.newrelic.com', agent: $globalAgents.https, agentOptions: { 'rejectUnauthorized': false }, strictSSL: false }; function callback(err, res, body) { ... }; $http.get(options, callback); Copy Cause This occurs in scripted monitor runs when the HTTP client ($http in scripted api monitors) or Chrome browser ($browser in scripted browser monitors) is not used to generate HTTP traffic. In some cases, certain request options in API monitors may force a new HTTP agent, one that is not instrumented by synthetic monitoring, to be used to collect HTTP traffic. ReferenceError: $network is not defined Problem The $network object used for setting monitor proxies is not available for that monitor’s runtime. Solution If your monitor was created before the 0.4.0 runtime release, create a new monitor to take advantage of the latest runtime. Your monitor’s current runtime version is shown at the top of the monitor's settings. For more information, see Scripted monitor version runtime environments. Cause This error occurs when attempting to use $network on a monitor with a runtime at or below 0.2.2. Proxying monitor traffic was introduced in monitor runtime version 0.4.0, causing this method to be evaluated as undefined on earlier monitor runtimes. ScriptTimeoutError Problem This error indicates that the job has reached the Docker container timeout threshold, and the script was terminated. Solution If this is a frequent error, consider breaking up the scripted tasks into a separate scripted monitors. If it appears that a specific task is causing the job to wait an unacceptable amount of time, consider changing the method by which you’re accomplishing that task. For example, changing $browser.findElement(locator: $driver.Locator) to $browser.waitForAndFindElement(locator: $driver.Locator [, timeout: number) would assigned the task its own configurable timeout. If you have multiple steps where the $browser.waitForAndFindElement(locator, timeout) function is called, ensure that the the sum of the provided timeouts to these steps does not exceed 180 seconds. If you’re finding it difficult to accomplish this, then that is a sign that the monitor should probably be broken up into separate monitor scripts. Cause All synthetic scripted monitors have a non-configurable maximum global 180s timeout for running a script. If a script has not completed after 180 seconds, the job is terminated. If this happens consistently it could be a sign of a script that is taking too long to complete, or that the job is waiting an extended period of time while attempting to perform a scripted task. StaleElementReferenceError: element is not attached to the page document Problem The target page has loaded, but there was a change to an element between the execution of an element locator and an action being executed on the element. Solution Set your scripted browser to wait until the page is settled before performing a findElement() action. This can be accomplished by setting a custom wait time, using the $browser.wait(fn, timeout) function prior to the findElement call, to wait for a condition that indicates a settled page state. This will make it less likely for DOM manipulation to cause a reference to go stale. Alternatively, you can set a custom sleep delay using $browser.sleep(sleeptime_ms), stalling script execution for a specified amount of time. As this is a fixed amount of wait-time, which does not account for increased network latency or degraded site performance, we recommend using the .wait() function instead. Cause This error typically happens when the script attempts to .click() an element after using either the findElement() or waitForAndFindElement() function. If the DOM has changed between when the element locator was generated and the action was executed against the element, this error will occur because the actual element has changed. For example: the findElement() function is used to generate an element reference while the page’s script is actively manipulating the DOM. The DOM is then changed, causing the previously generated reference to become stale. The now out-of-date reference is used in an attempt to perform a .click() action, resulting in this monitor failure. Tip For more information, see the Selenium documentation on Stale Element Reference Exceptions. TaskTimedOut: task timed-out waiting for element to be located using: <LOCATOR> Problem The waitForAndFindElement(<locator>, <timeout>) function failed to locate an element within the provided timeout. Solution Confirm that the element locator being used for the target element is accurate. Avoid using By.XPath() where possible, as it is rigidly tied to the page’s DOM structure and can easily become out-of-date when there are updates on the page. Cause The target element did not exist on the page when the waitForAndFindElement(<locator>, <timeout>) function was called. This may be caused by the target page not being in the expected state. Common reasons for this error include: There is a legitimate issue with the target site. The element locator being used is incorrect. The target site has changed, requiring the revision of the Synthetics script. The previous action in the script did not successfully complete, causing the page to be in an unexpected state when the subsequent waitForAndFindElement() call was initiated. TimeoutError: Page load timed-out (unable to finish all network requests on time) Problem The target page loaded successfully, but returned the error: TimeoutError: Page load timed-out (unable to finish all network requests on time) Solution If the failures began suddenly, investigate any requests that could be blocking or delaying the page load event. If you are unsure which request is causing the error, use the timeline view to identify any long running HTTP requests. If the page is frequently unable to fully load within the current timeout, set a custom page load timeout using the $browser.manage().timeouts().pageLoadTimeout(ms: number) function. Cause The target page loaded successfully, but the page load event was not fired within the page load timeout set in the .pageLoadTimeout() function. There are a number of reasons you could see this error message, including: A blocked resource request on the page held up the page load. A resource request processed slower than normal due to an underlying network issue. A dependent resource on the page blocked the iframe load event. TypeError: $browser.isElementPresent is not a function Problem The function isElementPresent(), used by Synthetics monitors with a runtime >= 0.5.0, has been deprecated in Selenium 3. Solution To continue to use this function after depreciation you will need to create a custom version of this function, such as: return $browser.findElements(ele).then(function(found) { return found.length > 0; }); } Copy Example usage, which would return true: $browser .get(\"https://www.newrelic.com\") .then(function() { return isElementPresent($driver.By.id(\"nav_signup\")); }) .then(function(found) { return console.log(found); }); Copy Cause This can occur when attempting to use a scripted browser monitor script from an older monitor ( < = 0.4.1 runtime) with a newer monitor ( >= 0.5.0) runtime. Scripted API monitor errors JobTimeoutError: Job timed-out after 180s Problem The scripted monitor run reached the 180 second non-configurable timeout threshold, and the run was terminated. Solution If this is a frequent error, consider breaking up the scripted tasks into a separate scripted monitors. If it appears that a specific task is causing the job to wait an unacceptable amount of time, consider changing the method by which you’re accomplishing that task. For example, changing $browser.findElement(locator: $driver.Locator) to $browser.waitForAndFindElement(locator: $driver.Locator [, timeout: number) would assign the task its own configurable timeout.

Solution If your monitor was created before the 0.4.0 runtime release, create a new monitor to take advantage of the latest runtime. Your monitor’s current runtime version is shown at the top of the Monitor Settings page. For more information, see Scripted monitor version runtime environments.

If this happens consistently it could be a sign of a script that is taking too long to complete, or that the job is waiting an extended period of time while attempting to perform a scripted task. SyntaxError: Unexpected token < Problem JSON.parse() was passed a string that begins with the < character and is likely HTML, instead of JSON. Solution Ensure the target endpoint is returning the expected response body. You can do this by logging the response body in the callback, before attempting to parse. Example: $http.get('http://www.newrelic.com', function(error, response, body) { if (error) { throw new Error(error); } console.log(body); // Log HTML response body, don't parse as JSON }); Copy Depending on the target API endpoint, you may need to include specific request headers to ensure that JSON is returned. Cause The script is attempting to use JSON.parse() on a response body after a request is made and is expecting the endpoint to return JSON, but HTML was returned instead. SyntaxError: Unexpected token u in JSON at position 0 Problem JSON.parse() was passed an undefined parameter, but expected a JSON string. Solution Troubleshoot the cause of the request error. Details on what is causing request errors can be found in the error object passed to the request callback function. Example: $http.get('http://www.newrelic.com', function(error, response, body) { if (error) { throw new Error(error); } var bodyJson = JSON.parse(body); console.log(bodyJson); // Log response body }); Copy Cause This can occur in Scripted API monitors when a performing an API request, then attempting to parse the request response within the callback function. The response body is passed to JSON.parse() without checking if the response body is undefined first. An undefined response body is often caused by a request error. If there is no error handling to prevent code that parses the response body, this monitor failure will occur. TypeError: Cannot read property 'statusCode' of undefined Problem The response object (and thus response.statusCode) in an API request callback is undefined. Solution Troubleshoot the cause of the request error. Details on what is causing request errors can be found in the error object passed to the request callback function. Example: $http.get('http://www.newrelic.com', function(error, response, body) { if (error) { throw new Error(error); } console.log(response.statusCode); }); Copy Cause This error occurs when there was an error completing the API request (for example, unable to reach server, unable to resolve DNS). In these instances, the request was not completed so the response object in the callback function arguments is undefined. If there is no error handling to prevent code that checks response status code, this monitor failure will occur.",

Understand SLA report metrics Use SLA reports to view aggregated performance metrics for a single monitor, or for all your monitors from the account-wide SLA Reports page. SLA reports include the following metrics: Duration: The average duration across all monitor results. Uptime: The percentage of all monitor results that ended successfully. For example, Monitor A might check 50 times per day, and Monitor B might check 150 times per day. If Monitor A has 29 successes out of 50 and Monitor B has 148 successes out of 150, the Uptime would be 88.5: (29+148)/(50+150)=88.5 For individual SLA reports, the uptime score only includes the selected monitor. Apdex: The average Apdex across all monitors. Monitors have a default Apdex T of 7 seconds, but you can customize Apdex T for individual monitors by editing their settings. Apdex F, which defines a frustrating result, is always four times Apdex T. For more information about Apdex, see Apdex: Measuring user satisfaction. For individual SLA reports, the Apdex score only includes the selected monitor. % Satisfied: The percentage of monitor results which complete in a \"satisfying\" time. A satisfying time is defined as a monitor result that completes in Apdex T or less. % Toleration: The percentage of monitor results which complete in a \"tolerable\" time. A tolerable time is greater than Apdex T, but less than Apdex F (four times Apdex T). % Frustrated: The percentage of monitor results which complete in a \"frustrating\" time.

      "body": "Read on to learn about synthetic monitoring's proxy settings and properties. Proxy settings API for scripted monitors Important You can set proxy server configuration for synthetic scripted monitors for monitor versions 0.4.0 or higher. The global object $network allows you to control the network configuration used by your synthetic scripted monitors. The following are applicable for both scripted browsers and API tests, unless otherwise stated. $network.setProxy(string or object PROXY URL) Sets a proxy server to be used for all per-URL requests (HTTP, HTTPS, and FTP). Additional notes: The port is optional. If not provided, it will be derived from the scheme. For example, for HTTP the port would be 80. The username and password are assumed to be the result of a call to encodeURIComponent(). Special characters like @ and : in the username and/or the password must be escaped. Returns This method returns a Promise that will resolve once the configuration has been applied. Parameters Parameter Data Type Description proxyURL | proxyUrlParsed String or Object The URL to connect to the proxy server. A string containing a proxyURL (for example, http://proxy_host:8888) or a plain object in the same format as defined by Node's url.parse(urlString) method. Examples An example of setting a proxy server with HTTP protocol on port 1234 with no authentication: $network.setProxy('http://host.com:1234') Copy An example of setting a proxy server with HTTP protocol with authentication credentials. $network.setProxy('http://proxyUsername:proxyPassword@proxyHost:1234') Copy $network.setProxyForHttp(string or object PROXY URL) Tip This call is exactly the same as the per-URL setProxy call, except that it applies to HTTP traffic. Sets a proxy server to be used for all HTTP requests. Additional notes: The port is optional. If not provided, it will be derived from the scheme. For example, for HTTP the port would be 80. The username and password are assumed to be the result of a call to encodeURIComponent(). Special characters like @ and : in the username and/or the password must be escaped. Returns This method returns a Promise that will resolve once the configuration has been applied. Parameters Parameter Data Type Description proxyURL | proxyUrlParsed String or Object The URL to connect to the proxy server. A string containing a proxyURL (for example, http://proxy_host:8888) or a plain object in the same format as defined by Node's url.parse(urlString) method. Examples An example of setting a proxy server with HTTP protocol on port 1234 with no authentication: $network.setProxyForHttp('http://host.com:1234') Copy An example of setting a proxy server with HTTP protocol with authentication credentials. $network.setProxyForHttp('http://proxyUsername:proxyPassword@proxyHost:1234') Copy $network.setProxyForHttps(string or object PROXY URL) Tip This call is exactly the same as the per-URL setProxy call, except that it applies to HTTPS traffic. Sets a proxy server to be used for all HTTPS requests. Additional notes: The port is optional. If not provided, it will be derived from the scheme. For example, for HTTP the default port would be 443. The username and password are assumed to be the result of a call to encodeURIComponent(). Special characters like @ and : in the username and/or the password must be escaped. Returns This method returns a Promise that will resolve once the configuration has been applied. Parameters Parameter Data Type Description proxyURL | proxyUrlParsed String or Object The URL to connect to the proxy server. A string containing a proxyURL (for example, http://proxy_host:8888) or a plain object in the same format as defined by Node's url.parse(urlString) method. Examples An example of setting a proxy server with HTTPS protocol on port 1234 with no authentication: $network.setProxyForHttps('https://host.com:1234') Copy An example of setting a proxy server with HTTPS protocol with authentication credentials. $network.setProxyForHttps('https://proxyUsername:proxyPassword@proxyHost:1234') Copy $network.setProxyPAC(string PAC SCRIPT URL, object AUTH OBJECT) Sets a proxy server via a proxy auto-config (PAC) script and returns a promise. This function is only available for scripted browser monitors. Returns This method returns a Promise that will resolve once the configuration has been applied. Parameters Parameter Data Type Description scriptURL String The URL of the PAC script. authCredentialsMap Object Map of authentication credentials to be provided to the proxy server(s), keyed by the hostnames of the proxy server. Values of this map must be defined in the format {username: 'authUsername', password: 'authPassword'} Examples An example of setting a proxy server via a proxy auto-config (PAC) script: var authCredentialsMap = { 'example.com': {username: 'authUsername', password: 'authPassword'}, } Copy $network.setProxyAdvanced(object PROXY RULES OBJECT) Tip This method is Chrome-specific: it only applies to scripted browser monitor types. It can be used to allow for a more flexible and complex proxy configuration. In most cases, this method will not be needed. Sets the proxy configuration using the format supported by Chrome Extension API for Proxying. The input is a ProxyRules object, as defined by the Chrome Extension API to configures proxies. You can add authCredentials for proxies that need it. See Parameters for more details. Returns This method returns a Promise that will resolve once the configuration has been applied. Parameters Parameter Data Type Description ProxyRules Object Object The proxyRulesObject is a plain object that follows the format ProxyRules as defined by the Chrome Extension API to configures proxies. This object is \"flavoured\" to fit our runtime: users can define an additional property, authCredentials, for the Proxy server objects to provide authentication credentials for a specific proxy server. authCredentials is an object in the format {username: 'authUsername', password: 'authPassword'}. Examples Here's an example of creating a proxyRules with authCredentials: var proxyRules = { singleProxy: { host:\"example.com\", authCredentials: { username: 'authUsername', password: 'authPassword' } } }; Copy Here's an example of setting up a proxied network with mixed network zone assets: var proxyRules = {singleProxy: {host:\"http://entproxy.mycompany.com\"}, bypassList:['s3.amazonaws.com','*.localcdn.com'] } $network.setProxyAdvanced(proxyRules) Copy $network.clearProxy() Clears/removes the current proxy configuration. Returns This method returns a Promise that will resolve once the configuration has been applied. $network.getProxy() This method returns the current proxy configuration. It must be synchronized in a promise callback. Examples An example of synchronizing getProxy with $network.setProxy(); and $network.clearProxy();: var assert = require('assert'); $network.setProxy(\"http://user:password@myproxyurl.com\") .then(function () { console.log('Proxy configuration applied'); //Note: $network.getProxy() is not synchronized with the webdriver Control Flow. //To make sure we get the proxy configuration after the call to setProxy() above // succeeds we need to use a promise callback var proxyData = $network.getProxy(); console.log(proxyData); }) .then(function () { // Again: getProxy() is not synchronized with the Webdriver Control Flow: we //need this promise callback otherwise clearProxy() might be called before the call // to getProxy() above returns return $network.clearProxy(); }) .then(function () { console.log('Proxy configuration cleared'); // We need this promise callback for reasons explained above var proxyData = $network.getProxy(); assert.equal(proxyData.rules, null); }); Copy Proxy properties Important This proxy information applies only to these versions: API monitors: 0.4.0, 0.2.2, 0.2.1, 0.1.0 Scripted monitors: 0.1.0 In order to analyze and collect your HTTP traffic metrics, New Relic must ensure the traffic passes through a conceptual funnel. Our synthetic monitoring includes a software funnel component capable of analyzing the HTTP requests or responses and then recording the information. New Relic's scripted browser monitors (versions 0.4.x and lower) include a mechanism to do this analysis without needing an HTTP proxy, so you don't have to configure anything. New Relic's API test (versions 0.4.x and lower) provides an $http object that is pre-configured to make the requests pass through the internal HTTP proxy. This allows you to write your test without including any proxy settings. If you want to use some other way to generate HTTP traffic while still collecting the HTTP traffic metrics, you can use $env.PROXY_HOST and $env.PROXY_PORT. To record traffic metrics, be sure to include these properties in your script.

      "body": "Problem Your New Relic's synthetic Simple, Scripted, or Scripted API (non-ping) monitor reported an error, but the application appears to have loaded correctly. For ping and simple monitor errors, see non-scripted monitor errors. Solutions Below are some of the most common non-ping monitor error messages. Simple or scripted browser errors Element A is not clickable at point (X, Y). Other element would receive the click: Element B Problem The synthetic script is attempting to .click() an element (Element A) at point (X,Y), but another element (Element B) is obscuring the target element. Solution Set a custom wait time, allowing time for a specific condition to be met. In this case, until the loading animation is no longer visible: .then(function() { return $browser.wait($driver.until.elementIsNotVisible($browser.findElement($driver.By.id('LOADING'))), 10000); }) Copy Alternatively, you can set a custom sleep delay using $browser.sleep(sleeptime_ms), stalling script execution for a specified amount of time. As this is a fixed amount of wait-time, which does not account for increased network latency or degraded site performance, we recommend using the .wait() function instead. Tip This will not correct .click() issues caused by sticky headers or footers. In these instances, you may need to scroll manually to bring the target into view. Cause This happens if the target element, at the time of the .click() function, is obscured by: A loading overlay, modal, or pop-up An animation that reveals the target element A sticky header or footer Error: element not visible Problem The targeted element is not visible to the Selenium WebDriver. Solution Verify that the targeted element does not have the CSS properties of display: none or visibility: hidden applied. Cause Any element that has a CSS property of display: none or visibility: hidden will not be found by the Selenium WebDriver, as the script will only look for elements that are actually visible to a user. Error: no such element: Unable to locate element: <LOCATOR> Problem The Selenium WebDriver was unable to find this element in the visible DOM. Solution To resolve this problem: Confirm that the element locator being used for the target element is accurate. Avoid using By.XPath where possible as it is rigidly tied to the page’s DOM structure, and can easily become out-of-date when there are updates on the page. If element is in an iframe, use $browser.switchTo().frame(<index or element reference>. Tip See the Selenium documentation for more information on switchTo() and TargetLocator() functions. Cause Common reasons for this error include: The targeted element is unable to be located by functions such as: $browser.findElement(locator: $driver.Locator) or $browser.waitForAndFindElement(locator: $driver.Locator [ , timeout: number This may be due to a timing issue. For example, the WebDriver is attempting to locate the element before the page has been loaded. Element is in an iframe, which is a separate document context. JobTimeoutError: Job timed-out after 180s Problem The scripted monitor run reached the 180 second non-configurable timeout threshold, and the run was terminated. Solution If this is a frequent error, consider breaking up the scripted tasks into a separate scripted monitors. If it appears that a specific task is causing the job to wait an unacceptable amount of time, consider changing the method by which you’re accomplishing that task. For example, changing $browser.findElement(locator: $driver.Locator) to $browser.waitForAndFindElement(locator: $driver.Locator [, timeout: number) would assign the task its own configurable timeout. If you have multiple steps where the $browser.waitForAndFindElement(locator, timeout) function is called, ensure that the the sum of the provided timeouts to these steps does not exceed 180 seconds. If you’re finding it difficult to accomplish this, then that is a sign that the monitor should probably be broken up into separate monitor scripts. Cause All synthetic scripted monitors have a non-configurable maximum global 180s timeout for running a script. If a script has not completed after 180 seconds, the job is terminated. If this happens consistently it could be a sign of a script that is taking too long to complete, or that the job is waiting an extended period of time while attempting to perform a scripted task. NetworkError: Monitor produced no traffic Problem The API test or scripted browser monitor appears to be running but is returning this error. Solution Ensure that $http.get() or $browser.get() are being called appropriately and are generating traffic. For Scripted API monitors, if you are using a request option to spin up an un-instrumented HTTP agent under the hood, specify one of our instrumented HTTP agents using either of the agent request options below: $globalAgents.http $globalAgents.https Example: var options = { uri: 'https://www.newrelic.com', agent: $globalAgents.https, agentOptions: { 'rejectUnauthorized': false }, strictSSL: false }; function callback(err, res, body) { ... }; $http.get(options, callback); Copy Cause This occurs in scripted monitor runs when the HTTP client ($http in scripted api monitors) or Chrome browser ($browser in scripted browser monitors) is not used to generate HTTP traffic. In some cases, certain request options in API monitors may force a new HTTP agent, one that is not instrumented by synthetic monitoring, to be used to collect HTTP traffic. ReferenceError: $network is not defined Problem The $network object used for setting monitor proxies is not available for that monitor’s runtime. Solution If your monitor was created before the 0.4.0 runtime release, create a new monitor to take advantage of the latest runtime. Your monitor’s current runtime version is shown at the top of the monitor's settings. For more information, see Scripted monitor version runtime environments. Cause This error occurs when attempting to use $network on a monitor with a runtime at or below 0.2.2. Proxying monitor traffic was introduced in monitor runtime version 0.4.0, causing this method to be evaluated as undefined on earlier monitor runtimes. ScriptTimeoutError Problem This error indicates that the job has reached the Docker container timeout threshold, and the script was terminated. Solution If this is a frequent error, consider breaking up the scripted tasks into a separate scripted monitors. If it appears that a specific task is causing the job to wait an unacceptable amount of time, consider changing the method by which you’re accomplishing that task. For example, changing $browser.findElement(locator: $driver.Locator) to $browser.waitForAndFindElement(locator: $driver.Locator [, timeout: number) would assigned the task its own configurable timeout. If you have multiple steps where the $browser.waitForAndFindElement(locator, timeout) function is called, ensure that the the sum of the provided timeouts to these steps does not exceed 180 seconds. If you’re finding it difficult to accomplish this, then that is a sign that the monitor should probably be broken up into separate monitor scripts. Cause All synthetic scripted monitors have a non-configurable maximum global 180s timeout for running a script. If a script has not completed after 180 seconds, the job is terminated. If this happens consistently it could be a sign of a script that is taking too long to complete, or that the job is waiting an extended period of time while attempting to perform a scripted task. StaleElementReferenceError: element is not attached to the page document Problem The target page has loaded, but there was a change to an element between the execution of an element locator and an action being executed on the element. Solution Set your scripted browser to wait until the page is settled before performing a findElement() action. This can be accomplished by setting a custom wait time, using the $browser.wait(fn, timeout) function prior to the findElement call, to wait for a condition that indicates a settled page state. This will make it less likely for DOM manipulation to cause a reference to go stale. Alternatively, you can set a custom sleep delay using $browser.sleep(sleeptime_ms), stalling script execution for a specified amount of time. As this is a fixed amount of wait-time, which does not account for increased network latency or degraded site performance, we recommend using the .wait() function instead. Cause This error typically happens when the script attempts to .click() an element after using either the findElement() or waitForAndFindElement() function. If the DOM has changed between when the element locator was generated and the action was executed against the element, this error will occur because the actual element has changed. For example: the findElement() function is used to generate an element reference while the page’s script is actively manipulating the DOM. The DOM is then changed, causing the previously generated reference to become stale. The now out-of-date reference is used in an attempt to perform a .click() action, resulting in this monitor failure. Tip For more information, see the Selenium documentation on Stale Element Reference Exceptions. TaskTimedOut: task timed-out waiting for element to be located using: <LOCATOR> Problem The waitForAndFindElement(<locator>, <timeout>) function failed to locate an element within the provided timeout. Solution Confirm that the element locator being used for the target element is accurate. Avoid using By.XPath() where possible, as it is rigidly tied to the page’s DOM structure and can easily become out-of-date when there are updates on the page. Cause The target element did not exist on the page when the waitForAndFindElement(<locator>, <timeout>) function was called. This may be caused by the target page not being in the expected state. Common reasons for this error include: There is a legitimate issue with the target site. The element locator being used is incorrect. The target site has changed, requiring the revision of the Synthetics script. The previous action in the script did not successfully complete, causing the page to be in an unexpected state when the subsequent waitForAndFindElement() call was initiated. TimeoutError: Page load timed-out (unable to finish all network requests on time) Problem The target page loaded successfully, but returned the error: TimeoutError: Page load timed-out (unable to finish all network requests on time) Solution If the failures began suddenly, investigate any requests that could be blocking or delaying the page load event. If you are unsure which request is causing the error, use the timeline view to identify any long running HTTP requests. If the page is frequently unable to fully load within the current timeout, set a custom page load timeout using the $browser.manage().timeouts().pageLoadTimeout(ms: number) function. Cause The target page loaded successfully, but the page load event was not fired within the page load timeout set in the .pageLoadTimeout() function. There are a number of reasons you could see this error message, including: A blocked resource request on the page held up the page load. A resource request processed slower than normal due to an underlying network issue. A dependent resource on the page blocked the iframe load event. TypeError: $browser.isElementPresent is not a function Problem The function isElementPresent(), used by Synthetics monitors with a runtime >= 0.5.0, has been deprecated in Selenium 3. Solution To continue to use this function after depreciation you will need to create a custom version of this function, such as: return $browser.findElements(ele).then(function(found) { return found.length > 0; }); } Copy Example usage, which would return true: $browser .get(\"https://www.newrelic.com\") .then(function() { return isElementPresent($driver.By.id(\"nav_signup\")); }) .then(function(found) { return console.log(found); }); Copy Cause This can occur when attempting to use a scripted browser monitor script from an older monitor ( < = 0.4.1 runtime) with a newer monitor ( >= 0.5.0) runtime. Scripted API monitor errors JobTimeoutError: Job timed-out after 180s Problem The scripted monitor run reached the 180 second non-configurable timeout threshold, and the run was terminated. Solution If this is a frequent error, consider breaking up the scripted tasks into a separate scripted monitors.

SyntaxError: Unexpected token < Problem JSON.parse() was passed a string that begins with the < character and is likely HTML, instead of JSON. Solution Ensure the target endpoint is returning the expected response body. You can do this by logging the response body in the callback, before attempting to parse. Example: $http.get('http://www.newrelic.com', function(error, response, body) { if (error) { throw new Error(error); } console.log(body); // Log HTML response body, don't parse as JSON }); Copy Depending on the target API endpoint, you may need to include specific request headers to ensure that JSON is returned. Cause The script is attempting to use JSON.parse() on a response body after a request is made and is expecting the endpoint to return JSON, but HTML was returned instead. SyntaxError: Unexpected token u in JSON at position 0 Problem JSON.parse() was passed an undefined parameter, but expected a JSON string. Solution Troubleshoot the cause of the request error. Details on what is causing request errors can be found in the error object passed to the request callback function. Example: $http.get('http://www.newrelic.com', function(error, response, body) { if (error) { throw new Error(error); } var bodyJson = JSON.parse(body); console.log(bodyJson); // Log response body }); Copy Cause This can occur in Scripted API monitors when a performing an API request, then attempting to parse the request response within the callback function. The response body is passed to JSON.parse() without checking if the response body is undefined first. An undefined response body is often caused by a request error. If there is no error handling to prevent code that parses the response body, this monitor failure will occur. TypeError: Cannot read property 'statusCode' of undefined Problem The response object (and thus response.statusCode) in an API request callback is undefined. Solution Troubleshoot the cause of the request error. Details on what is causing request errors can be found in the error object passed to the request callback function. Example: $http.get('http://www.newrelic.com', function(error, response, body) { if (error) { throw new Error(error); } console.log(response.statusCode); }); Copy Cause This error occurs when there was an error completing the API request (for example, unable to reach server, unable to resolve DNS). In these instances, the request was not completed so the response object in the callback function arguments is undefined. If there is no error handling to prevent code that checks response status code, this monitor failure will occur.",

You can also view SLA reports for individual monitors: Go to one.newrelic.com > Synthetics > (select a monitor) > SLA. one.newrelic.com > Synthetics > SLA Report: Use SLA reports to understand your monitors' performance over time. Understand SLA report metrics Use SLA reports to view aggregated performance metrics for a single monitor, or for all your monitors from the account-wide SLA Reports page. SLA reports include the following metrics: Duration: The average duration across all monitor results. Uptime: The percentage of all monitor results that ended successfully. For example, Monitor A might check 50 times per day, and Monitor B might check 150 times per day. If Monitor A has 29 successes out of 50 and Monitor B has 148 successes out of 150, the Uptime would be 88.5: (29+148)/(50+150)=88.5 For individual SLA reports, the uptime score only includes the selected monitor. Apdex: The average Apdex across all monitors. Monitors have a default Apdex T of 7 seconds, but you can customize Apdex T for individual monitors by editing their settings. Apdex F, which defines a frustrating result, is always four times Apdex T. For more information about Apdex, see Apdex: Measuring user satisfaction. For individual SLA reports, the Apdex score only includes the selected monitor. % Satisfied: The percentage of monitor results which complete in a \"satisfying\" time. A satisfying time is defined as a monitor result that completes in Apdex T or less. % Toleration: The percentage of monitor results which complete in a \"tolerable\" time. A tolerable time is greater than Apdex T, but less than Apdex F (four times Apdex T). % Frustrated: The percentage of monitor results which complete in a \"frustrating\" time. A frustrating time is greater than Apdex F (four times Apdex T). The account-wide SLA report includes all monitor types (ping, simple browser, scripted browser, and API test).

Substitute your values for the variables highlighted and described below. SELECT average(duration), apdex(duration, t:), percentage(count(*), WHERE result='SUCCESS') FROM SyntheticCheck FACET timeperiod Copy Variable Value t: Supply the Apdex T that you would like to calculate your apdex against. The duration attribute in the SyntheticCheck event is stored in milliseconds, so an Apdex T value of 7 seconds should be included as 7000. timeperiod This is the period that you would like to calculate on. For a daily report, facet on dateOf(timestamp), for a weekly report facet on weekOf(timestamp) and for a monthly report facet on monthOf(timestamp).

      "body": "Read on to learn about synthetic monitoring's proxy settings and properties. Proxy settings API for scripted monitors Important You can set proxy server configuration for synthetic scripted monitors for monitor versions 0.4.0 or higher. The global object $network allows you to control the network configuration used by your synthetic scripted monitors. The following are applicable for both scripted browsers and API tests, unless otherwise stated. $network.setProxy(string or object PROXY URL) Sets a proxy server to be used for all per-URL requests (HTTP, HTTPS, and FTP). Additional notes: The port is optional. If not provided, it will be derived from the scheme. For example, for HTTP the port would be 80. The username and password are assumed to be the result of a call to encodeURIComponent(). Special characters like @ and : in the username and/or the password must be escaped. Returns This method returns a Promise that will resolve once the configuration has been applied. Parameters Parameter Data Type Description proxyURL | proxyUrlParsed String or Object The URL to connect to the proxy server. A string containing a proxyURL (for example, http://proxy_host:8888) or a plain object in the same format as defined by Node's url.parse(urlString) method. Examples An example of setting a proxy server with HTTP protocol on port 1234 with no authentication: $network.setProxy('http://host.com:1234') Copy An example of setting a proxy server with HTTP protocol with authentication credentials. $network.setProxy('http://proxyUsername:proxyPassword@proxyHost:1234') Copy $network.setProxyForHttp(string or object PROXY URL) Tip This call is exactly the same as the per-URL setProxy call, except that it applies to HTTP traffic. Sets a proxy server to be used for all HTTP requests. Additional notes: The port is optional. If not provided, it will be derived from the scheme. For example, for HTTP the port would be 80. The username and password are assumed to be the result of a call to encodeURIComponent(). Special characters like @ and : in the username and/or the password must be escaped. Returns This method returns a Promise that will resolve once the configuration has been applied. Parameters Parameter Data Type Description proxyURL | proxyUrlParsed String or Object The URL to connect to the proxy server. A string containing a proxyURL (for example, http://proxy_host:8888) or a plain object in the same format as defined by Node's url.parse(urlString) method. Examples An example of setting a proxy server with HTTP protocol on port 1234 with no authentication: $network.setProxyForHttp('http://host.com:1234') Copy An example of setting a proxy server with HTTP protocol with authentication credentials. $network.setProxyForHttp('http://proxyUsername:proxyPassword@proxyHost:1234') Copy $network.setProxyForHttps(string or object PROXY URL) Tip This call is exactly the same as the per-URL setProxy call, except that it applies to HTTPS traffic. Sets a proxy server to be used for all HTTPS requests. Additional notes: The port is optional. If not provided, it will be derived from the scheme. For example, for HTTP the default port would be 443. The username and password are assumed to be the result of a call to encodeURIComponent(). Special characters like @ and : in the username and/or the password must be escaped. Returns This method returns a Promise that will resolve once the configuration has been applied. Parameters Parameter Data Type Description proxyURL | proxyUrlParsed String or Object The URL to connect to the proxy server. A string containing a proxyURL (for example, http://proxy_host:8888) or a plain object in the same format as defined by Node's url.parse(urlString) method. Examples An example of setting a proxy server with HTTPS protocol on port 1234 with no authentication: $network.setProxyForHttps('https://host.com:1234') Copy An example of setting a proxy server with HTTPS protocol with authentication credentials. $network.setProxyForHttps('https://proxyUsername:proxyPassword@proxyHost:1234') Copy $network.setProxyPAC(string PAC SCRIPT URL, object AUTH OBJECT) Sets a proxy server via a proxy auto-config (PAC) script and returns a promise. This function is only available for scripted browser monitors. Returns This method returns a Promise that will resolve once the configuration has been applied. Parameters Parameter Data Type Description scriptURL String The URL of the PAC script. authCredentialsMap Object Map of authentication credentials to be provided to the proxy server(s), keyed by the hostnames of the proxy server. Values of this map must be defined in the format {username: 'authUsername', password: 'authPassword'} Examples An example of setting a proxy server via a proxy auto-config (PAC) script: var authCredentialsMap = { 'example.com': {username: 'authUsername', password: 'authPassword'}, } Copy $network.setProxyAdvanced(object PROXY RULES OBJECT) Tip This method is Chrome-specific: it only applies to scripted browser monitor types. It can be used to allow for a more flexible and complex proxy configuration. In most cases, this method will not be needed. Sets the proxy configuration using the format supported by Chrome Extension API for Proxying. The input is a ProxyRules object, as defined by the Chrome Extension API to configures proxies. You can add authCredentials for proxies that need it. See Parameters for more details. Returns This method returns a Promise that will resolve once the configuration has been applied. Parameters Parameter Data Type Description ProxyRules Object Object The proxyRulesObject is a plain object that follows the format ProxyRules as defined by the Chrome Extension API to configures proxies. This object is \"flavoured\" to fit our runtime: users can define an additional property, authCredentials, for the Proxy server objects to provide authentication credentials for a specific proxy server. authCredentials is an object in the format {username: 'authUsername', password: 'authPassword'}. Examples Here's an example of creating a proxyRules with authCredentials: var proxyRules = { singleProxy: { host:\"example.com\", authCredentials: { username: 'authUsername', password: 'authPassword' } } }; Copy Here's an example of setting up a proxied network with mixed network zone assets: var proxyRules = {singleProxy: {host:\"http://entproxy.mycompany.com\"}, bypassList:['s3.amazonaws.com','*.localcdn.com'] } $network.setProxyAdvanced(proxyRules) Copy $network.clearProxy() Clears/removes the current proxy configuration. Returns This method returns a Promise that will resolve once the configuration has been applied. $network.getProxy() This method returns the current proxy configuration. It must be synchronized in a promise callback. Examples An example of synchronizing getProxy with $network.setProxy(); and $network.clearProxy();: var assert = require('assert'); $network.setProxy(\"http://user:password@myproxyurl.com\") .then(function () { console.log('Proxy configuration applied'); //Note: $network.getProxy() is not synchronized with the webdriver Control Flow. //To make sure we get the proxy configuration after the call to setProxy() above // succeeds we need to use a promise callback var proxyData = $network.getProxy(); console.log(proxyData); }) .then(function () { // Again: getProxy() is not synchronized with the Webdriver Control Flow: we //need this promise callback otherwise clearProxy() might be called before the call // to getProxy() above returns return $network.clearProxy(); }) .then(function () { console.log('Proxy configuration cleared'); // We need this promise callback for reasons explained above var proxyData = $network.getProxy(); assert.equal(proxyData.rules, null); }); Copy Proxy properties Important This proxy information applies only to these versions: API monitors: 0.4.0, 0.2.2, 0.2.1, 0.1.0 Scripted monitors: 0.1.0 In order to analyze and collect your HTTP traffic metrics, New Relic must ensure the traffic passes through a conceptual funnel. Our synthetic monitoring includes a software funnel component capable of analyzing the HTTP requests or responses and then recording the information. New Relic's scripted browser monitors (versions 0.4.x and lower) include a mechanism to do this analysis without needing an HTTP proxy, so you don't have to configure anything. New Relic's API test (versions 0.4.x and lower) provides an $http object that is pre-configured to make the requests pass through the internal HTTP proxy. This allows you to write your test without including any proxy settings. If you want to use some other way to generate HTTP traffic while still collecting the HTTP traffic metrics, you can use $env.PROXY_HOST and $env.PROXY_PORT. To record traffic metrics, be sure to include these properties in your script.

      "body": "Problem Your synthetic ping or simple monitor reported one of these errors. For scripted monitor errors, see non-ping errors. Solutions These are some of the most common non-scripted monitor error messages. ERROR: Job timed out after 65 seconds Problem Your ping timed out after 65 seconds, the non-configurable check duration time limit. Solution The 65 second time limit is non-configurable. Pings exceeding 65 seconds may be a result of latency from the target server. Investigate potential issues along the network path between our servers and yours, as this may indicate an issue experienced by real users of your application. Cause Ping monitors will first perform a HEAD request. If this request fails for any reason, or reaches the 30 second HTTP connect timeout for ping monitors, then a subsequent GET request is performed. This error happens when both the HEAD and GET request exceed 30 seconds, usually due to server latency. NetworkError: Connect to (HOST) [HOST./IP ADDRESS] failed: connect timed out Problem HTTP requests during the check exceeded the non-configurable 30 second TCP connection timeout limit. Solution The 30 second time limit is non-configurable. Investigate potential issues along the network path between our servers and yours, as this may indicate an issue experienced by real users of your application. Cause This failure indicates an issue reaching your site from the location where the synthetic's check was performed. NetworkError: Connect to (HOST) [HOST./IP ADDRESS] failed: Connection refused Problem The target server refused connection from the synthetic ping monitor HTTP client. Solution Add our synthetic monitoring IP addresses to your allow list, to ensure traffic from our synthetic monitors can reach the target server. Cause The target server is likely blocking or rate-limiting synthetic's traffic. HTTPError: Server replied with HTTP XXX response code Problem The synthetic monitor encountered an unsuccessful status code, usually a response code that is not in the 2XX/3XX range. Solution Check your server-side logging to determine why the response code was sent. To assist with identifying synthetic's traffic on your server, all synthetic monitoring traffic includes an X-Abuse-Info HTTP request header and we provide a list of origin IP addresses for all synthetic monitoring traffic. Cause The cause depends on the response code sent. SSLVerificationError: (ERROR) Problem Your monitor returns an SSLVerificationError. Solution Go to one.newrelic.com > Synthetics > (select a monitor) > Settings > General > Advanced options, then disable the Verify SSL check. Cause SSLVerificationError failures are a result of the optional Verify SSL check failing against the target host. SSL verification failed during execution for domain <TARGET_URL> failures indicate that the URL provided is not HTTPS or does not redirect to an HTTPS endpoint. SSLVerificationError: (<ERROR CODE>) <ERROR> errors are retrieved directly from the openssl command and often indicate a legitimate SSL configuration issue on the target site. ResponseValidationError: Response did not contain the expected string Problem The string value included in the synthetic monitor’s optional Response Validation field was not found in the target server’s response. Solution To troubleshoot: Check the failed results timeline to ensure the endpoint where the response validation text is expected, is the last endpoint being requested. Attempt a curl request against the target endpoint to see if the expected response body is returned. Ensure your endpoint doesn't have policies that will return different content depending on header content or request activity. If so, use a scripted browser to spoof a specific header string. If you’re using a simple browser to monitor a page whose content is loaded via JavaScript after the page’s load event is fired, consider using a scripted browser monitor instead. You can program scripted browsers to wait for specific elements to appear on a page before interacting with them. Cause The cause depends on the monitor type: Ping monitors: The string value must be present in the first 1MB (10^6 bytes) of the response body. Simple browsers: The string must be visible on the page when the page’s load event is fired. NetworkError: Read timed out Problem The monitor client was able to establish an HTTP connection to the target site, but then exceeded the 30 second read timeout while waiting for a response. Solution To troubleshoot: Investigate the target server's performance during the time period the issue was observed. Investigate potential issues along the network path between our servers and yours, as this may indicate an issue experienced by real users of your application. Cause This indicates an issue with the target server responding to the synthetic monitor HTTP client, or network latency between your server and ours. NetworkError: Socket is closed Problem The synthetic monitor's HTTP client was able to establish a connection to the target server. The target server then closed the connection without a response. Solution Add our synthetic monitoring IP addresses to your allow list, to ensure traffic from our synthetic monitors can reach the target server. Cause Edge infrastructure sometimes implements measures such as this for an application endpoint to handle traffic that violates behavior policies like rate limiting. NetworkError: No route to host (Host unreachable) Problem The synthetic monitoring client was able to resolve the target host’s IP address, but it was unable to find a route to the target host to establish a connection. Solution If the failure is occurring on a public synthetic monitoring's location, ensure that the DNS records for this host are resolving to a reachable IP address. If the failure is occurring on a synthetic monitoring's private location, ensure the private minion’s network configuration is properly configured and that the target hostname is resolvable and reachable via the private minion virtual command line interface. Cause This occurs when the target hostname resolves to a non-routable IP address per RFC 1918. HTTPError: Server sent us too many redirects (20) Problem The synthetic monitor client was redirected (observing 301 or 302 response codes) 20 times when performing a request to the target endpoint. Solution Ensure that the target endpoint redirects client requests less than 20 times. If this is only occurring within New Relic, recreate the issue outside New Relic to troubleshoot the root cause. Use a similar client to perform requests against the target endpoint: Ping monitors: HTTP client similar to curl. Simple browser and scripted browser monitors: Chrome 60 instance in an Ubuntu 14.04.5 VM. Scripted API monitors: Use the request HTTP client for Node.js. Cause This occurs when the monitored endpoint effectively serves a redirect loop to the synthetic monitor: The initial response redirects to another URL which redirects to another URL, etc. NetworkError: DNS resolution failed for host: (HOST) Problem The target hostname was not able to be resolved by the synthetic monitor’s HTTP client. Solution Private synthetic monitoring's locations: Confirm that the network configuration for the minion is correct. If the target hostname is an internal one, ensure that the minion is using your network’s internal DNS service that is able to resolve the host. The containerized private minion and the runner containers it spawns on host (to run non-ping checks) should inherit DNS configuration from the host /etc/resolv.conf. Docker: Network arguments like –dns or -network used in the Docker run command on the containerized private minion will only be used by the minion container but not the runner containers. If the DNS points to the loopback interface such as 127.0.0.1, define a DNS config at the Docker daemon level, or use a tool like dnsmasq to make sure the runner will forward DNS requests on the Docker bridge interface. Public synthetic monitoring locations: Ensure that the target site’s DNS record can be looked up by public DNS services such as Google public DNS and Amazon-provided DNS. Cause Our public synthetic monitoring locations use Google public DNS and Amazon-provided DNS. If DNS resolution of the target host is failing on our public synthetic monitoring locations, this is likely an issue other users are facing. If you are seeing DNS resolution related monitor failures on a synthetic monitoring private location, this is often caused by the private minion for that location having an invalid network configuration. BlockedRequestError: (URL) Problem The target domain is blocked by synthetic monitoring. Solution To unblock domains, you must use a scripted browser monitor and manually make calls in your script. Cause Synthetic monitoring specifically exclude scripts for popular analytics services such as Google Analytics. This ensures your analytics tools continue to receive accurate data, even with thousands of monitors checking your website each month.",

Understand SLA report metrics Use SLA reports to view aggregated performance metrics for a single monitor, or for all your monitors from the account-wide SLA Reports page. SLA reports include the following metrics: Duration: The average duration across all monitor results. Uptime: The percentage of all monitor results that ended successfully. For example, Monitor A might check 50 times per day, and Monitor B might check 150 times per day. If Monitor A has 29 successes out of 50 and Monitor B has 148 successes out of 150, the Uptime would be 88.5: (29+148)/(50+150)=88.5 For individual SLA reports, the uptime score only includes the selected monitor. Apdex: The average Apdex across all monitors. Monitors have a default Apdex T of 7 seconds, but you can customize Apdex T for individual monitors by editing their settings. Apdex F, which defines a frustrating result, is always four times Apdex T. For more information about Apdex, see Apdex: Measuring user satisfaction. For individual SLA reports, the Apdex score only includes the selected monitor. % Satisfied: The percentage of monitor results which complete in a \"satisfying\" time. A satisfying time is defined as a monitor result that completes in Apdex T or less. % Toleration: The percentage of monitor results which complete in a \"tolerable\" time. A tolerable time is greater than Apdex T, but less than Apdex F (four times Apdex T). % Frustrated: The percentage of monitor results which complete in a \"frustrating\" time. A frustrating time is greater than Apdex F (four times Apdex T). The account-wide SLA report includes all monitor types (ping, simple browser, scripted browser, and API test).

      "body": "Read on to learn about synthetic monitoring's proxy settings and properties. Proxy settings API for scripted monitors Important You can set proxy server configuration for synthetic scripted monitors for monitor versions 0.4.0 or higher. The global object $network allows you to control the network configuration used by your synthetic scripted monitors. The following are applicable for both scripted browsers and API tests, unless otherwise stated. $network.setProxy(string or object PROXY URL) Sets a proxy server to be used for all per-URL requests (HTTP, HTTPS, and FTP). Additional notes: The port is optional. If not provided, it will be derived from the scheme. For example, for HTTP the port would be 80. The username and password are assumed to be the result of a call to encodeURIComponent(). Special characters like @ and : in the username and/or the password must be escaped. Returns This method returns a Promise that will resolve once the configuration has been applied. Parameters Parameter Data Type Description proxyURL | proxyUrlParsed String or Object The URL to connect to the proxy server. A string containing a proxyURL (for example, http://proxy_host:8888) or a plain object in the same format as defined by Node's url.parse(urlString) method. Examples An example of setting a proxy server with HTTP protocol on port 1234 with no authentication: $network.setProxy('http://host.com:1234') Copy An example of setting a proxy server with HTTP protocol with authentication credentials. $network.setProxy('http://proxyUsername:proxyPassword@proxyHost:1234') Copy $network.setProxyForHttp(string or object PROXY URL) Tip This call is exactly the same as the per-URL setProxy call, except that it applies to HTTP traffic. Sets a proxy server to be used for all HTTP requests. Additional notes: The port is optional. If not provided, it will be derived from the scheme. For example, for HTTP the port would be 80. The username and password are assumed to be the result of a call to encodeURIComponent(). Special characters like @ and : in the username and/or the password must be escaped. Returns This method returns a Promise that will resolve once the configuration has been applied. Parameters Parameter Data Type Description proxyURL | proxyUrlParsed String or Object The URL to connect to the proxy server. A string containing a proxyURL (for example, http://proxy_host:8888) or a plain object in the same format as defined by Node's url.parse(urlString) method. Examples An example of setting a proxy server with HTTP protocol on port 1234 with no authentication: $network.setProxyForHttp('http://host.com:1234') Copy An example of setting a proxy server with HTTP protocol with authentication credentials. $network.setProxyForHttp('http://proxyUsername:proxyPassword@proxyHost:1234') Copy $network.setProxyForHttps(string or object PROXY URL) Tip This call is exactly the same as the per-URL setProxy call, except that it applies to HTTPS traffic. Sets a proxy server to be used for all HTTPS requests. Additional notes: The port is optional. If not provided, it will be derived from the scheme. For example, for HTTP the default port would be 443. The username and password are assumed to be the result of a call to encodeURIComponent(). Special characters like @ and : in the username and/or the password must be escaped. Returns This method returns a Promise that will resolve once the configuration has been applied. Parameters Parameter Data Type Description proxyURL | proxyUrlParsed String or Object The URL to connect to the proxy server. A string containing a proxyURL (for example, http://proxy_host:8888) or a plain object in the same format as defined by Node's url.parse(urlString) method. Examples An example of setting a proxy server with HTTPS protocol on port 1234 with no authentication: $network.setProxyForHttps('https://host.com:1234') Copy An example of setting a proxy server with HTTPS protocol with authentication credentials. $network.setProxyForHttps('https://proxyUsername:proxyPassword@proxyHost:1234') Copy $network.setProxyPAC(string PAC SCRIPT URL, object AUTH OBJECT) Sets a proxy server via a proxy auto-config (PAC) script and returns a promise. This function is only available for scripted browser monitors. Returns This method returns a Promise that will resolve once the configuration has been applied. Parameters Parameter Data Type Description scriptURL String The URL of the PAC script. authCredentialsMap Object Map of authentication credentials to be provided to the proxy server(s), keyed by the hostnames of the proxy server. Values of this map must be defined in the format {username: 'authUsername', password: 'authPassword'} Examples An example of setting a proxy server via a proxy auto-config (PAC) script: var authCredentialsMap = { 'example.com': {username: 'authUsername', password: 'authPassword'}, } Copy $network.setProxyAdvanced(object PROXY RULES OBJECT) Tip This method is Chrome-specific: it only applies to scripted browser monitor types. It can be used to allow for a more flexible and complex proxy configuration. In most cases, this method will not be needed. Sets the proxy configuration using the format supported by Chrome Extension API for Proxying. The input is a ProxyRules object, as defined by the Chrome Extension API to configures proxies. You can add authCredentials for proxies that need it. See Parameters for more details. Returns This method returns a Promise that will resolve once the configuration has been applied. Parameters Parameter Data Type Description ProxyRules Object Object The proxyRulesObject is a plain object that follows the format ProxyRules as defined by the Chrome Extension API to configures proxies. This object is \"flavoured\" to fit our runtime: users can define an additional property, authCredentials, for the Proxy server objects to provide authentication credentials for a specific proxy server. authCredentials is an object in the format {username: 'authUsername', password: 'authPassword'}. Examples Here's an example of creating a proxyRules with authCredentials: var proxyRules = { singleProxy: { host:\"example.com\", authCredentials: { username: 'authUsername', password: 'authPassword' } } }; Copy Here's an example of setting up a proxied network with mixed network zone assets: var proxyRules = {singleProxy: {host:\"http://entproxy.mycompany.com\"}, bypassList:['s3.amazonaws.com','*.localcdn.com'] } $network.setProxyAdvanced(proxyRules) Copy $network.clearProxy() Clears/removes the current proxy configuration. Returns This method returns a Promise that will resolve once the configuration has been applied. $network.getProxy() This method returns the current proxy configuration. It must be synchronized in a promise callback. Examples An example of synchronizing getProxy with $network.setProxy(); and $network.clearProxy();: var assert = require('assert'); $network.setProxy(\"http://user:password@myproxyurl.com\") .then(function () { console.log('Proxy configuration applied'); //Note: $network.getProxy() is not synchronized with the webdriver Control Flow. //To make sure we get the proxy configuration after the call to setProxy() above // succeeds we need to use a promise callback var proxyData = $network.getProxy(); console.log(proxyData); }) .then(function () { // Again: getProxy() is not synchronized with the Webdriver Control Flow: we //need this promise callback otherwise clearProxy() might be called before the call // to getProxy() above returns return $network.clearProxy(); }) .then(function () { console.log('Proxy configuration cleared'); // We need this promise callback for reasons explained above var proxyData = $network.getProxy(); assert.equal(proxyData.rules, null); }); Copy Proxy properties Important This proxy information applies only to these versions: API monitors: 0.4.0, 0.2.2, 0.2.1, 0.1.0 Scripted monitors: 0.1.0 In order to analyze and collect your HTTP traffic metrics, New Relic must ensure the traffic passes through a conceptual funnel. Our synthetic monitoring includes a software funnel component capable of analyzing the HTTP requests or responses and then recording the information. New Relic's scripted browser monitors (versions 0.4.x and lower) include a mechanism to do this analysis without needing an HTTP proxy, so you don't have to configure anything. New Relic's API test (versions 0.4.x and lower) provides an $http object that is pre-configured to make the requests pass through the internal HTTP proxy. This allows you to write your test without including any proxy settings. If you want to use some other way to generate HTTP traffic while still collecting the HTTP traffic metrics, you can use $env.PROXY_HOST and $env.PROXY_PORT. To record traffic metrics, be sure to include these properties in your script.

      "body": "Problem Your New Relic's synthetic Simple, Scripted, or Scripted API (non-ping) monitor reported an error, but the application appears to have loaded correctly. For ping and simple monitor errors, see non-scripted monitor errors. Solutions Below are some of the most common non-ping monitor error messages. Simple or scripted browser errors Element A is not clickable at point (X, Y). Other element would receive the click: Element B Problem The synthetic script is attempting to .click() an element (Element A) at point (X,Y), but another element (Element B) is obscuring the target element. Solution Set a custom wait time, allowing time for a specific condition to be met. In this case, until the loading animation is no longer visible: .then(function() { return $browser.wait($driver.until.elementIsNotVisible($browser.findElement($driver.By.id('LOADING'))), 10000); }) Copy Alternatively, you can set a custom sleep delay using $browser.sleep(sleeptime_ms), stalling script execution for a specified amount of time. As this is a fixed amount of wait-time, which does not account for increased network latency or degraded site performance, we recommend using the .wait() function instead. Tip This will not correct .click() issues caused by sticky headers or footers. In these instances, you may need to scroll manually to bring the target into view. Cause This happens if the target element, at the time of the .click() function, is obscured by: A loading overlay, modal, or pop-up An animation that reveals the target element A sticky header or footer Error: element not visible Problem The targeted element is not visible to the Selenium WebDriver. Solution Verify that the targeted element does not have the CSS properties of display: none or visibility: hidden applied. Cause Any element that has a CSS property of display: none or visibility: hidden will not be found by the Selenium WebDriver, as the script will only look for elements that are actually visible to a user. Error: no such element: Unable to locate element: <LOCATOR> Problem The Selenium WebDriver was unable to find this element in the visible DOM. Solution To resolve this problem: Confirm that the element locator being used for the target element is accurate. Avoid using By.XPath where possible as it is rigidly tied to the page’s DOM structure, and can easily become out-of-date when there are updates on the page. If element is in an iframe, use $browser.switchTo().frame(<index or element reference>. Tip See the Selenium documentation for more information on switchTo() and TargetLocator() functions. Cause Common reasons for this error include: The targeted element is unable to be located by functions such as: $browser.findElement(locator: $driver.Locator) or $browser.waitForAndFindElement(locator: $driver.Locator [ , timeout: number This may be due to a timing issue. For example, the WebDriver is attempting to locate the element before the page has been loaded. Element is in an iframe, which is a separate document context. JobTimeoutError: Job timed-out after 180s Problem The scripted monitor run reached the 180 second non-configurable timeout threshold, and the run was terminated. Solution If this is a frequent error, consider breaking up the scripted tasks into a separate scripted monitors. If it appears that a specific task is causing the job to wait an unacceptable amount of time, consider changing the method by which you’re accomplishing that task. For example, changing $browser.findElement(locator: $driver.Locator) to $browser.waitForAndFindElement(locator: $driver.Locator [, timeout: number) would assign the task its own configurable timeout. If you have multiple steps where the $browser.waitForAndFindElement(locator, timeout) function is called, ensure that the the sum of the provided timeouts to these steps does not exceed 180 seconds. If you’re finding it difficult to accomplish this, then that is a sign that the monitor should probably be broken up into separate monitor scripts. Cause All synthetic scripted monitors have a non-configurable maximum global 180s timeout for running a script. If a script has not completed after 180 seconds, the job is terminated. If this happens consistently it could be a sign of a script that is taking too long to complete, or that the job is waiting an extended period of time while attempting to perform a scripted task. NetworkError: Monitor produced no traffic Problem The API test or scripted browser monitor appears to be running but is returning this error. Solution Ensure that $http.get() or $browser.get() are being called appropriately and are generating traffic. For Scripted API monitors, if you are using a request option to spin up an un-instrumented HTTP agent under the hood, specify one of our instrumented HTTP agents using either of the agent request options below: $globalAgents.http $globalAgents.https Example: var options = { uri: 'https://www.newrelic.com', agent: $globalAgents.https, agentOptions: { 'rejectUnauthorized': false }, strictSSL: false }; function callback(err, res, body) { ... }; $http.get(options, callback); Copy Cause This occurs in scripted monitor runs when the HTTP client ($http in scripted api monitors) or Chrome browser ($browser in scripted browser monitors) is not used to generate HTTP traffic. In some cases, certain request options in API monitors may force a new HTTP agent, one that is not instrumented by synthetic monitoring, to be used to collect HTTP traffic. ReferenceError: $network is not defined Problem The $network object used for setting monitor proxies is not available for that monitor’s runtime. Solution If your monitor was created before the 0.4.0 runtime release, create a new monitor to take advantage of the latest runtime. Your monitor’s current runtime version is shown at the top of the monitor's settings. For more information, see Scripted monitor version runtime environments. Cause This error occurs when attempting to use $network on a monitor with a runtime at or below 0.2.2. Proxying monitor traffic was introduced in monitor runtime version 0.4.0, causing this method to be evaluated as undefined on earlier monitor runtimes. ScriptTimeoutError Problem This error indicates that the job has reached the Docker container timeout threshold, and the script was terminated. Solution If this is a frequent error, consider breaking up the scripted tasks into a separate scripted monitors. If it appears that a specific task is causing the job to wait an unacceptable amount of time, consider changing the method by which you’re accomplishing that task. For example, changing $browser.findElement(locator: $driver.Locator) to $browser.waitForAndFindElement(locator: $driver.Locator [, timeout: number) would assigned the task its own configurable timeout. If you have multiple steps where the $browser.waitForAndFindElement(locator, timeout) function is called, ensure that the the sum of the provided timeouts to these steps does not exceed 180 seconds. If you’re finding it difficult to accomplish this, then that is a sign that the monitor should probably be broken up into separate monitor scripts. Cause All synthetic scripted monitors have a non-configurable maximum global 180s timeout for running a script. If a script has not completed after 180 seconds, the job is terminated. If this happens consistently it could be a sign of a script that is taking too long to complete, or that the job is waiting an extended period of time while attempting to perform a scripted task. StaleElementReferenceError: element is not attached to the page document Problem The target page has loaded, but there was a change to an element between the execution of an element locator and an action being executed on the element. Solution Set your scripted browser to wait until the page is settled before performing a findElement() action. This can be accomplished by setting a custom wait time, using the $browser.wait(fn, timeout) function prior to the findElement call, to wait for a condition that indicates a settled page state. This will make it less likely for DOM manipulation to cause a reference to go stale. Alternatively, you can set a custom sleep delay using $browser.sleep(sleeptime_ms), stalling script execution for a specified amount of time. As this is a fixed amount of wait-time, which does not account for increased network latency or degraded site performance, we recommend using the .wait() function instead. Cause This error typically happens when the script attempts to .click() an element after using either the findElement() or waitForAndFindElement() function. If the DOM has changed between when the element locator was generated and the action was executed against the element, this error will occur because the actual element has changed. For example: the findElement() function is used to generate an element reference while the page’s script is actively manipulating the DOM. The DOM is then changed, causing the previously generated reference to become stale. The now out-of-date reference is used in an attempt to perform a .click() action, resulting in this monitor failure. Tip For more information, see the Selenium documentation on Stale Element Reference Exceptions. TaskTimedOut: task timed-out waiting for element to be located using: <LOCATOR> Problem The waitForAndFindElement(<locator>, <timeout>) function failed to locate an element within the provided timeout. Solution Confirm that the element locator being used for the target element is accurate. Avoid using By.XPath() where possible, as it is rigidly tied to the page’s DOM structure and can easily become out-of-date when there are updates on the page. Cause The target element did not exist on the page when the waitForAndFindElement(<locator>, <timeout>) function was called. This may be caused by the target page not being in the expected state. Common reasons for this error include: There is a legitimate issue with the target site. The element locator being used is incorrect. The target site has changed, requiring the revision of the Synthetics script. The previous action in the script did not successfully complete, causing the page to be in an unexpected state when the subsequent waitForAndFindElement() call was initiated. TimeoutError: Page load timed-out (unable to finish all network requests on time) Problem The target page loaded successfully, but returned the error: TimeoutError: Page load timed-out (unable to finish all network requests on time) Solution If the failures began suddenly, investigate any requests that could be blocking or delaying the page load event. If you are unsure which request is causing the error, use the timeline view to identify any long running HTTP requests. If the page is frequently unable to fully load within the current timeout, set a custom page load timeout using the $browser.manage().timeouts().pageLoadTimeout(ms: number) function. Cause The target page loaded successfully, but the page load event was not fired within the page load timeout set in the .pageLoadTimeout() function. There are a number of reasons you could see this error message, including: A blocked resource request on the page held up the page load. A resource request processed slower than normal due to an underlying network issue. A dependent resource on the page blocked the iframe load event. TypeError: $browser.isElementPresent is not a function Problem The function isElementPresent(), used by Synthetics monitors with a runtime >= 0.5.0, has been deprecated in Selenium 3. Solution To continue to use this function after depreciation you will need to create a custom version of this function, such as: return $browser.findElements(ele).then(function(found) { return found.length > 0; }); } Copy Example usage, which would return true: $browser .get(\"https://www.newrelic.com\") .then(function() { return isElementPresent($driver.By.id(\"nav_signup\")); }) .then(function(found) { return console.log(found); }); Copy Cause This can occur when attempting to use a scripted browser monitor script from an older monitor ( < = 0.4.1 runtime) with a newer monitor ( >= 0.5.0) runtime. Scripted API monitor errors JobTimeoutError: Job timed-out after 180s Problem The scripted monitor run reached the 180 second non-configurable timeout threshold, and the run was terminated. Solution If this is a frequent error, consider breaking up the scripted tasks into a separate scripted monitors. If it appears that a specific task is causing the job to wait an unacceptable amount of time, consider changing the method by which you’re accomplishing that task. For example, changing $browser.findElement(locator: $driver.Locator) to $browser.waitForAndFindElement(locator: $driver.Locator [, timeout: number) would assign the task its own configurable timeout. If you have multiple steps where the $browser.waitForAndFindElement(locator, timeout) function is called, ensure that the the sum of the provided timeouts to these steps does not exceed 180 seconds. If you’re finding it difficult to accomplish this, then that is a sign that the monitor should probably be broken up into separate monitor scripts. Cause All synthetic scripted monitors have a non-configurable maximum global 180s timeout for running a script. If a script has not completed after 180 seconds, the job is terminated. If this happens consistently it could be a sign of a script that is taking too long to complete, or that the job is waiting an extended period of time while attempting to perform a scripted task. NetworkError: Monitor produced no traffic Problem The API test or scripted browser monitor appears to be running but is returning this error. Solution Ensure that $http.get() or $browser.get() are being called appropriately and are generating traffic. For Scripted API monitors, if you are using a request option to spin up an un-instrumented HTTP agent under the hood, specify one of our instrumented HTTP agents using either of the agent request options below: $globalAgents.http $globalAgents.https Example: var options = { uri: 'https://www.newrelic.com', agent: $globalAgents.https, agentOptions: { 'rejectUnauthorized': false }, strictSSL: false }; function callback(err, res, body) { ... }; $http.get(options, callback); Copy Cause This occurs in scripted monitor runs when the HTTP client ($http in scripted api monitors) or Chrome browser ($browser in scripted browser monitors) is not used to generate HTTP traffic. In some cases, certain request options in API monitors may force a new HTTP agent, one that is not instrumented by Synthetics, to be used to collect HTTP traffic. ReferenceError: $network is not defined Problem The $network object used for setting monitor proxies is not available for that monitor’s runtime. Solution If your monitor was created before the 0.4.0 runtime release, create a new monitor to take advantage of the latest runtime. Your monitor’s current runtime version is shown at the top of the Monitor Settings page. For more information, see Scripted monitor version runtime environments. Cause This error occurs when attempting to use $network on a monitor with a runtime at or below 0.2.2. Proxying monitor traffic was introduced in monitor runtime version 0.4.0, causing this method to be evaluated as undefined on earlier monitor runtimes. ScriptTimeoutError Problem This error indicates that the job has reached the Docker container timeout threshold, and the script was terminated. Solution If this is a frequent error, consider breaking up the scripted tasks into a separate scripted monitors. If it appears that a specific task is causing the job to wait an unacceptable amount of time, consider changing the method by which you’re accomplishing that task. For example, changing $browser.findElement(locator: $driver.Locator) to $browser.waitForAndFindElement(locator: $driver.Locator [, timeout: number) would assigned the task its own configurable timeout. If you have multiple steps where the $browser.waitForAndFindElement(locator, timeout) function is called, ensure that the the sum of the provided timeouts to these steps does not exceed 180 seconds. If you’re finding it difficult to accomplish this, then that is a sign that the monitor should probably be broken up into separate monitor scripts. Cause All synthetic scripted monitors have a non-configurable maximum global 180s timeout for running a script. If a script has not completed after 180 seconds, the job is terminated. If this happens consistently it could be a sign of a script that is taking too long to complete, or that the job is waiting an extended period of time while attempting to perform a scripted task. SyntaxError: Unexpected token < Problem JSON.parse() was passed a string that begins with the < character and is likely HTML, instead of JSON. Solution Ensure the target endpoint is returning the expected response body. You can do this by logging the response body in the callback, before attempting to parse. Example: $http.get('http://www.newrelic.com', function(error, response, body) { if (error) { throw new Error(error); } console.log(body); // Log HTML response body, don't parse as JSON }); Copy Depending on the target API endpoint, you may need to include specific request headers to ensure that JSON is returned. Cause The script is attempting to use JSON.parse() on a response body after a request is made and is expecting the endpoint to return JSON, but HTML was returned instead. SyntaxError: Unexpected token u in JSON at position 0 Problem JSON.parse() was passed an undefined parameter, but expected a JSON string. Solution Troubleshoot the cause of the request error. Details on what is causing request errors can be found in the error object passed to the request callback function. Example: $http.get('http://www.newrelic.com', function(error, response, body) { if (error) { throw new Error(error); } var bodyJson = JSON.parse(body); console.log(bodyJson); // Log response body }); Copy Cause This can occur in Scripted API monitors when a performing an API request, then attempting to parse the request response within the callback function. The response body is passed to JSON.parse() without checking if the response body is undefined first. An undefined response body is often caused by a request error. If there is no error handling to prevent code that parses the response body, this monitor failure will occur. TypeError: Cannot read property 'statusCode' of undefined Problem The response object (and thus response.statusCode) in an API request callback is undefined. Solution Troubleshoot the cause of the request error. Details on what is causing request errors can be found in the error object passed to the request callback function. Example: $http.get('http://www.newrelic.com', function(error, response, body) { if (error) { throw new Error(error); } console.log(response.statusCode); }); Copy Cause This error occurs when there was an error completing the API request (for example, unable to reach server, unable to resolve DNS). In these instances, the request was not completed so the response object in the callback function arguments is undefined. If there is no error handling to prevent code that checks response status code, this monitor failure will occur.",

Understand SLA report metrics Use SLA reports to view aggregated performance metrics for a single monitor, or for all your monitors from the account-wide SLA Reports page. SLA reports include the following metrics: Duration: The average duration across all monitor results. Uptime: The percentage of all monitor results that ended successfully. For example, Monitor A might check 50 times per day, and Monitor B might check 150 times per day. If Monitor A has 29 successes out of 50 and Monitor B has 148 successes out of 150, the Uptime would be 88.5: (29+148)/(50+150)=88.5 For individual SLA reports, the uptime score only includes the selected monitor. Apdex: The average Apdex across all monitors. Monitors have a default Apdex T of 7 seconds, but you can customize Apdex T for individual monitors by editing their settings. Apdex F, which defines a frustrating result, is always four times Apdex T. For more information about Apdex, see Apdex: Measuring user satisfaction. For individual SLA reports, the Apdex score only includes the selected monitor. % Satisfied: The percentage of monitor results which complete in a \"satisfying\" time. A satisfying time is defined as a monitor result that completes in Apdex T or less. % Toleration: The percentage of monitor results which complete in a \"tolerable\" time. A tolerable time is greater than Apdex T, but less than Apdex F (four times Apdex T). % Frustrated: The percentage of monitor results which complete in a \"frustrating\" time.

      "body": "Read on to learn about synthetic monitoring's proxy settings and properties. Proxy settings API for scripted monitors Important You can set proxy server configuration for synthetic scripted monitors for monitor versions 0.4.0 or higher. The global object $network allows you to control the network configuration used by your synthetic scripted monitors. The following are applicable for both scripted browsers and API tests, unless otherwise stated. $network.setProxy(string or object PROXY URL) Sets a proxy server to be used for all per-URL requests (HTTP, HTTPS, and FTP). Additional notes: The port is optional. If not provided, it will be derived from the scheme. For example, for HTTP the port would be 80. The username and password are assumed to be the result of a call to encodeURIComponent(). Special characters like @ and : in the username and/or the password must be escaped. Returns This method returns a Promise that will resolve once the configuration has been applied. Parameters Parameter Data Type Description proxyURL | proxyUrlParsed String or Object The URL to connect to the proxy server. A string containing a proxyURL (for example, http://proxy_host:8888) or a plain object in the same format as defined by Node's url.parse(urlString) method. Examples An example of setting a proxy server with HTTP protocol on port 1234 with no authentication: $network.setProxy('http://host.com:1234') Copy An example of setting a proxy server with HTTP protocol with authentication credentials. $network.setProxy('http://proxyUsername:proxyPassword@proxyHost:1234') Copy $network.setProxyForHttp(string or object PROXY URL) Tip This call is exactly the same as the per-URL setProxy call, except that it applies to HTTP traffic. Sets a proxy server to be used for all HTTP requests. Additional notes: The port is optional. If not provided, it will be derived from the scheme. For example, for HTTP the port would be 80. The username and password are assumed to be the result of a call to encodeURIComponent(). Special characters like @ and : in the username and/or the password must be escaped. Returns This method returns a Promise that will resolve once the configuration has been applied. Parameters Parameter Data Type Description proxyURL | proxyUrlParsed String or Object The URL to connect to the proxy server. A string containing a proxyURL (for example, http://proxy_host:8888) or a plain object in the same format as defined by Node's url.parse(urlString) method. Examples An example of setting a proxy server with HTTP protocol on port 1234 with no authentication: $network.setProxyForHttp('http://host.com:1234') Copy An example of setting a proxy server with HTTP protocol with authentication credentials. $network.setProxyForHttp('http://proxyUsername:proxyPassword@proxyHost:1234') Copy $network.setProxyForHttps(string or object PROXY URL) Tip This call is exactly the same as the per-URL setProxy call, except that it applies to HTTPS traffic. Sets a proxy server to be used for all HTTPS requests. Additional notes: The port is optional. If not provided, it will be derived from the scheme. For example, for HTTP the default port would be 443. The username and password are assumed to be the result of a call to encodeURIComponent(). Special characters like @ and : in the username and/or the password must be escaped. Returns This method returns a Promise that will resolve once the configuration has been applied. Parameters Parameter Data Type Description proxyURL | proxyUrlParsed String or Object The URL to connect to the proxy server. A string containing a proxyURL (for example, http://proxy_host:8888) or a plain object in the same format as defined by Node's url.parse(urlString) method. Examples An example of setting a proxy server with HTTPS protocol on port 1234 with no authentication: $network.setProxyForHttps('https://host.com:1234') Copy An example of setting a proxy server with HTTPS protocol with authentication credentials. $network.setProxyForHttps('https://proxyUsername:proxyPassword@proxyHost:1234') Copy $network.setProxyPAC(string PAC SCRIPT URL, object AUTH OBJECT) Sets a proxy server via a proxy auto-config (PAC) script and returns a promise. This function is only available for scripted browser monitors. Returns This method returns a Promise that will resolve once the configuration has been applied. Parameters Parameter Data Type Description scriptURL String The URL of the PAC script. authCredentialsMap Object Map of authentication credentials to be provided to the proxy server(s), keyed by the hostnames of the proxy server. Values of this map must be defined in the format {username: 'authUsername', password: 'authPassword'} Examples An example of setting a proxy server via a proxy auto-config (PAC) script: var authCredentialsMap = { 'example.com': {username: 'authUsername', password: 'authPassword'}, } Copy $network.setProxyAdvanced(object PROXY RULES OBJECT) Tip This method is Chrome-specific: it only applies to scripted browser monitor types. It can be used to allow for a more flexible and complex proxy configuration. In most cases, this method will not be needed. Sets the proxy configuration using the format supported by Chrome Extension API for Proxying. The input is a ProxyRules object, as defined by the Chrome Extension API to configures proxies. You can add authCredentials for proxies that need it. See Parameters for more details. Returns This method returns a Promise that will resolve once the configuration has been applied. Parameters Parameter Data Type Description ProxyRules Object Object The proxyRulesObject is a plain object that follows the format ProxyRules as defined by the Chrome Extension API to configures proxies. This object is \"flavoured\" to fit our runtime: users can define an additional property, authCredentials, for the Proxy server objects to provide authentication credentials for a specific proxy server. authCredentials is an object in the format {username: 'authUsername', password: 'authPassword'}. Examples Here's an example of creating a proxyRules with authCredentials: var proxyRules = { singleProxy: { host:\"example.com\", authCredentials: { username: 'authUsername', password: 'authPassword' } } }; Copy Here's an example of setting up a proxied network with mixed network zone assets: var proxyRules = {singleProxy: {host:\"http://entproxy.mycompany.com\"}, bypassList:['s3.amazonaws.com','*.localcdn.com'] } $network.setProxyAdvanced(proxyRules) Copy $network.clearProxy() Clears/removes the current proxy configuration. Returns This method returns a Promise that will resolve once the configuration has been applied. $network.getProxy() This method returns the current proxy configuration. It must be synchronized in a promise callback. Examples An example of synchronizing getProxy with $network.setProxy(); and $network.clearProxy();: var assert = require('assert'); $network.setProxy(\"http://user:password@myproxyurl.com\") .then(function () { console.log('Proxy configuration applied'); //Note: $network.getProxy() is not synchronized with the webdriver Control Flow. //To make sure we get the proxy configuration after the call to setProxy() above // succeeds we need to use a promise callback var proxyData = $network.getProxy(); console.log(proxyData); }) .then(function () { // Again: getProxy() is not synchronized with the Webdriver Control Flow: we //need this promise callback otherwise clearProxy() might be called before the call // to getProxy() above returns return $network.clearProxy(); }) .then(function () { console.log('Proxy configuration cleared'); // We need this promise callback for reasons explained above var proxyData = $network.getProxy(); assert.equal(proxyData.rules, null); }); Copy Proxy properties Important This proxy information applies only to these versions: API monitors: 0.4.0, 0.2.2, 0.2.1, 0.1.0 Scripted monitors: 0.1.0 In order to analyze and collect your HTTP traffic metrics, New Relic must ensure the traffic passes through a conceptual funnel. Our synthetic monitoring includes a software funnel component capable of analyzing the HTTP requests or responses and then recording the information. New Relic's scripted browser monitors (versions 0.4.x and lower) include a mechanism to do this analysis without needing an HTTP proxy, so you don't have to configure anything. New Relic's API test (versions 0.4.x and lower) provides an $http object that is pre-configured to make the requests pass through the internal HTTP proxy. This allows you to write your test without including any proxy settings. If you want to use some other way to generate HTTP traffic while still collecting the HTTP traffic metrics, you can use $env.PROXY_HOST and $env.PROXY_PORT. To record traffic metrics, be sure to include these properties in your script.

You can also view SLA reports for individual monitors: Go to one.newrelic.com > Synthetics > (select a monitor) > SLA. one.newrelic.com > Synthetics > SLA Report: Use SLA reports to understand your monitors' performance over time. Understand SLA report metrics Use SLA reports to view aggregated performance metrics for a single monitor, or for all your monitors from the account-wide SLA Reports page. SLA reports include the following metrics: Duration: The average duration across all monitor results. Uptime: The percentage of all monitor results that ended successfully. For example, Monitor A might check 50 times per day, and Monitor B might check 150 times per day. If Monitor A has 29 successes out of 50 and Monitor B has 148 successes out of 150, the Uptime would be 88.5: (29+148)/(50+150)=88.5 For individual SLA reports, the uptime score only includes the selected monitor. Apdex: The average Apdex across all monitors. Monitors have a default Apdex T of 7 seconds, but you can customize Apdex T for individual monitors by editing their settings. Apdex F, which defines a frustrating result, is always four times Apdex T. For more information about Apdex, see Apdex: Measuring user satisfaction. For individual SLA reports, the Apdex score only includes the selected monitor. % Satisfied: The percentage of monitor results which complete in a \"satisfying\" time. A satisfying time is defined as a monitor result that completes in Apdex T or less. % Toleration: The percentage of monitor results which complete in a \"tolerable\" time. A tolerable time is greater than Apdex T, but less than Apdex F (four times Apdex T). % Frustrated: The percentage of monitor results which complete in a \"frustrating\" time. A frustrating time is greater than Apdex F (four times Apdex T). The account-wide SLA report includes all monitor types (ping, simple browser, scripted browser, and API test).

Proxy settings API for scripted monitors Important You can set proxy server configuration for synthetic scripted monitors for monitor versions 0.4.0 or higher. The global object $network allows you to control the network configuration used by your synthetic scripted monitors. The following are applicable for both scripted browsers and API tests, unless otherwise stated. $network.setProxy(string or object PROXY URL) Sets a proxy server to be used for all per-URL requests (HTTP, HTTPS, and FTP). Additional notes: The port is optional. If not provided, it will be derived from the scheme. For example, for HTTP the port would be 80. The username and password are assumed to be the result of a call to encodeURIComponent(). Special characters like @ and : in the username and/or the password must be escaped. Returns This method returns a Promise that will resolve once the configuration has been applied. Parameters Parameter Data Type Description proxyURL | proxyUrlParsed String or Object The URL to connect to the proxy server. A string containing a proxyURL (for example, http://proxy_host:8888) or a plain object in the same format as defined by Node's url.parse(urlString) method. Examples An example of setting a proxy server with HTTP protocol on port 1234 with no authentication: $network.setProxy('http://host.com:1234') Copy An example of setting a proxy server with HTTP protocol with authentication credentials. $network.setProxy('http://proxyUsername:proxyPassword@proxyHost:1234') Copy $network.setProxyForHttp(string or object PROXY URL) Tip This call is exactly the same as the per-URL setProxy call, except that it applies to HTTP traffic. Sets a proxy server to be used for all HTTP requests. Additional notes: The port is optional. If not provided, it will be derived from the scheme. For example, for HTTP the port would be 80. The username and password are assumed to be the result of a call to encodeURIComponent(). Special characters like @ and : in the username and/or the password must be escaped. Returns This method returns a Promise that will resolve once the configuration has been applied. Parameters Parameter Data Type Description proxyURL | proxyUrlParsed String or Object The URL to connect to the proxy server. A string containing a proxyURL (for example, http://proxy_host:8888) or a plain object in the same format as defined by Node's url.parse(urlString) method. Examples An example of setting a proxy server with HTTP protocol on port 1234 with no authentication: $network.setProxyForHttp('http://host.com:1234') Copy An example of setting a proxy server with HTTP protocol with authentication credentials. $network.setProxyForHttp('http://proxyUsername:proxyPassword@proxyHost:1234') Copy $network.setProxyForHttps(string or object PROXY URL) Tip This call is exactly the same as the per-URL setProxy call, except that it applies to HTTPS traffic. Sets a proxy server to be used for all HTTPS requests. Additional notes: The port is optional. If not provided, it will be derived from the scheme. For example, for HTTP the default port would be 443. The username and password are assumed to be the result of a call to encodeURIComponent(). Special characters like @ and : in the username and/or the password must be escaped. Returns This method returns a Promise that will resolve once the configuration has been applied. Parameters Parameter Data Type Description proxyURL | proxyUrlParsed String or Object The URL to connect to the proxy server. A string containing a proxyURL (for example, http://proxy_host:8888) or a plain object in the same format as defined by Node's url.parse(urlString) method. Examples An example of setting a proxy server with HTTPS protocol on port 1234 with no authentication: $network.setProxyForHttps('https://host.com:1234') Copy An example of setting a proxy server with HTTPS protocol with authentication credentials. $network.setProxyForHttps('https://proxyUsername:proxyPassword@proxyHost:1234') Copy $network.setProxyPAC(string PAC SCRIPT URL, object AUTH OBJECT) Sets a proxy server via a proxy auto-config (PAC) script and returns a promise. This function is only available for scripted browser monitors. Returns This method returns a Promise that will resolve once the configuration has been applied. Parameters Parameter Data Type Description scriptURL String The URL of the PAC script. authCredentialsMap Object Map of authentication credentials to be provided to the proxy server(s), keyed by the hostnames of the proxy server. Values of this map must be defined in the format {username: 'authUsername', password: 'authPassword'} Examples An example of setting a proxy server via a proxy auto-config (PAC) script: var authCredentialsMap = { 'example.com': {username: 'authUsername', password: 'authPassword'}, } Copy $network.setProxyAdvanced(object PROXY RULES OBJECT) Tip This method is Chrome-specific: it only applies to scripted browser monitor types. It can be used to allow for a more flexible and complex proxy configuration. In most cases, this method will not be needed. Sets the proxy configuration using the format supported by Chrome Extension API for Proxying. The input is a ProxyRules object, as defined by the Chrome Extension API to configures proxies. You can add authCredentials for proxies that need it. See Parameters for more details. Returns This method returns a Promise that will resolve once the configuration has been applied. Parameters Parameter Data Type Description ProxyRules Object Object The proxyRulesObject is a plain object that follows the format ProxyRules as defined by the Chrome Extension API to configures proxies. This object is \"flavoured\" to fit our runtime: users can define an additional property, authCredentials, for the Proxy server objects to provide authentication credentials for a specific proxy server. authCredentials is an object in the format {username: 'authUsername', password: 'authPassword'}. Examples Here's an example of creating a proxyRules with authCredentials: var proxyRules = { singleProxy: { host:\"example.com\", authCredentials: { username: 'authUsername', password: 'authPassword' } } }; Copy Here's an example of setting up a proxied network with mixed network zone assets: var proxyRules = {singleProxy: {host:\"http://entproxy.mycompany.com\"}, bypassList:['s3.amazonaws.com','*.localcdn.com'] } $network.setProxyAdvanced(proxyRules) Copy $network.clearProxy() Clears/removes the current proxy configuration. Returns This method returns a Promise that will resolve once the configuration has been applied. $network.getProxy() This method returns the current proxy configuration. It must be synchronized in a promise callback. Examples An example of synchronizing getProxy with $network.setProxy(); and $network.clearProxy();: var assert = require('assert'); $network.setProxy(\"http://user:password@myproxyurl.com\") .then(function () { console.log('Proxy configuration applied'); //Note: $network.getProxy() is not synchronized with the webdriver Control Flow. //To make sure we get the proxy configuration after the call to setProxy() above // succeeds we need to use a promise callback var proxyData = $network.getProxy(); console.log(proxyData); }) .then(function () { // Again: getProxy() is not synchronized with the Webdriver Control Flow: we //need this promise callback otherwise clearProxy() might be called before the call // to getProxy() above returns return $network.clearProxy(); }) .then(function () { console.log('Proxy configuration cleared'); // We need this promise callback for reasons explained above var proxyData = $network.getProxy(); assert.equal(proxyData.rules, null); }); Copy Proxy properties Important This proxy information applies only to these versions: API monitors: 0.4.0, 0.2.2, 0.2.1, 0.1.0 Scripted monitors: 0.1.0 In order to analyze and collect your HTTP traffic metrics, New Relic must ensure the traffic passes through a conceptual funnel. Our synthetic monitoring includes a software funnel component capable of analyzing the HTTP requests or responses and then recording the information. New Relic's scripted browser monitors (versions 0.4.x and lower) include a mechanism to do this analysis without needing an HTTP proxy, so you don't have to configure anything. New Relic's API test (versions 0.4.x and lower) provides an $http object that is pre-configured to make the requests pass through the internal HTTP proxy. This allows you to write your test without including any proxy settings. If you want to use some other way to generate HTTP traffic while still collecting the HTTP traffic metrics, you can use $env.PROXY_HOST and $env.PROXY_PORT. To record traffic metrics, be sure to include these properties in your script.

Select the locations from which you want your monitor to run, and then click Save monitor to confirm. Wait a few minutes, then check your monitor from the Monitors index. Add a broken links monitor Go to one.newrelic.com > Synthetics > Create monitor. Select the broken links check monitor type. Specify a name and enter the URL you'd like to monitor. Select the period to determine your monitor's frequency. Optional: Add tags to help you find this monitor later. Select the locations from which you want your monitor to run, and then click Save monitor to confirm. Wait a few minutes, then check your monitor from the Monitors index. Tip You can also use the Synthetics REST API to add monitors. For example, you can create a GET request to the monitor you want to use as the source for configuration, then use those key values to use in a POST to \"copy\" and create a new monitor. Edit a monitor To edit an existing monitor: From the Monitors tab in one.newrelic.com > Synthetics, select the monitor you want to edit. In the side menu, select a link to change the following settings: Select Settings > General to edit name, Apdex T, URL, locations, frequency, and advanced options. For Scripted browser and API test monitors, select Settings > Script to edit your monitor script. For synthetic monitoring alerts, click Manage alerts. Select Save changes to confirm. Important You cannot change a monitor's type after the monitor is created. Delete a monitor To delete a monitor: From the Monitors tab in one.newrelic.com > Synthetics, select the monitor you want to edit. From the selected monitor, select Settings > General. Scroll to the bottom of the page and select the trash can icon. Tip You can also use the Synthetics REST API to delete a monitor. Monitor settings When configuring monitors, the following settings are available: Type Select the type of monitor you want to create. A monitor's type can't be changed after the monitor is created. Ping: Specify a single URL to monitor for availability. New Relic will check this URL via HEAD or GET requests. The non-configurable timeout for this monitor is 60 seconds. Simple browser: Specify a single URL to monitor via real browser. Once each frequency interval, New Relic will check this URL via a Selenium-powered Google Chrome browser. The non-configurable timeout for this monitor is 60 seconds. Scripted browser: Create a script to drive a Selenium-powered Google Chrome browser. The browser follows each step in the script to verify that complex behavior is working as expected (for example, searching a website, then clicking one of the search results). The non-configurable timeout for this monitor is 180 seconds. API test: Create an API script to ensure your API endpoint is working correctly. For more information, see Write API tests. The non-configurable timeout for this monitor is 180 seconds. Monitor name Defines a name for the monitor. Monitor names cannot contain unencoded angle brackets (< >). To include angle brackets in a monitor name, encode them as HTML bracket entities (&lt; &gt;) in the UI or API. Location Select the locations where you want your monitor to run. Select more locations to ensure that your application is available to users around the world. If you have any private locations, they will be listed here too. You can use the Synthetics API location endpoint to retrieve a list of valid locations for your account. Your monitor will run one check from each selected location during each frequency interval. For example, if you select three locations and define a frequency of 15 minutes, your monitor will run three checks in each 15 minute period (or 8,640 checks per month). Frequency Select how often the monitor runs, in increments of minutes, hours, or 1 day. This frequency applies to each location. For example, if you select three locations and a Frequency of 15 minutes, your monitor will run three checks, on average every 5 minutes, in each 15 minute period (or 8,640 checks per month). Alerts Specify an email address to receive alerts when a monitor fails. Or, attach a monitor to an existing alert policy for more notification options. For more information, see Alerting for synthetic monitoring. Apdex T Customize the Apdex T for this monitor. This setting is only available when editing the settings for an existing monitor, not when creating a new monitor. Change the Apdex T from the default 7 seconds for more accurate Apdex scores in your SLA reports. For example, if you have a very long scripted browser, you might adjust the Apdex T to 15 seconds to more closely reflect the usual completion time. Similarly, a good Apdex T for a simple browser check might be only 2 seconds. Response Validation (optional) Specify text to search for on the page. When using simple browser or ping monitor types, there is a 1MB (10^6 bytes) limit on the page load.

Understand SLA report metrics Use SLA reports to view aggregated performance metrics for a single monitor, or for all your monitors from the account-wide SLA Reports page. SLA reports include the following metrics: Duration: The average duration across all monitor results. Uptime: The percentage of all monitor results that ended successfully. For example, Monitor A might check 50 times per day, and Monitor B might check 150 times per day. If Monitor A has 29 successes out of 50 and Monitor B has 148 successes out of 150, the Uptime would be 88.5: (29+148)/(50+150)=88.5 For individual SLA reports, the uptime score only includes the selected monitor. Apdex: The average Apdex across all monitors. Monitors have a default Apdex T of 7 seconds, but you can customize Apdex T for individual monitors by editing their settings. Apdex F, which defines a frustrating result, is always four times Apdex T. For more information about Apdex, see Apdex: Measuring user satisfaction. For individual SLA reports, the Apdex score only includes the selected monitor. % Satisfied: The percentage of monitor results which complete in a \"satisfying\" time. A satisfying time is defined as a monitor result that completes in Apdex T or less. % Toleration: The percentage of monitor results which complete in a \"tolerable\" time. A tolerable time is greater than Apdex T, but less than Apdex F (four times Apdex T). % Frustrated: The percentage of monitor results which complete in a \"frustrating\" time. A frustrating time is greater than Apdex F (four times Apdex T). The account-wide SLA report includes all monitor types (ping, simple browser, scripted browser, and API test).

      "body": "Read on to learn about synthetic monitoring's proxy settings and properties. Proxy settings API for scripted monitors Important You can set proxy server configuration for synthetic scripted monitors for monitor versions 0.4.0 or higher. The global object $network allows you to control the network configuration used by your synthetic scripted monitors. The following are applicable for both scripted browsers and API tests, unless otherwise stated. $network.setProxy(string or object PROXY URL) Sets a proxy server to be used for all per-URL requests (HTTP, HTTPS, and FTP). Additional notes: The port is optional. If not provided, it will be derived from the scheme. For example, for HTTP the port would be 80. The username and password are assumed to be the result of a call to encodeURIComponent(). Special characters like @ and : in the username and/or the password must be escaped. Returns This method returns a Promise that will resolve once the configuration has been applied. Parameters Parameter Data Type Description proxyURL | proxyUrlParsed String or Object The URL to connect to the proxy server. A string containing a proxyURL (for example, http://proxy_host:8888) or a plain object in the same format as defined by Node's url.parse(urlString) method. Examples An example of setting a proxy server with HTTP protocol on port 1234 with no authentication: $network.setProxy('http://host.com:1234') Copy An example of setting a proxy server with HTTP protocol with authentication credentials. $network.setProxy('http://proxyUsername:proxyPassword@proxyHost:1234') Copy $network.setProxyForHttp(string or object PROXY URL) Tip This call is exactly the same as the per-URL setProxy call, except that it applies to HTTP traffic. Sets a proxy server to be used for all HTTP requests. Additional notes: The port is optional. If not provided, it will be derived from the scheme. For example, for HTTP the port would be 80. The username and password are assumed to be the result of a call to encodeURIComponent(). Special characters like @ and : in the username and/or the password must be escaped. Returns This method returns a Promise that will resolve once the configuration has been applied. Parameters Parameter Data Type Description proxyURL | proxyUrlParsed String or Object The URL to connect to the proxy server. A string containing a proxyURL (for example, http://proxy_host:8888) or a plain object in the same format as defined by Node's url.parse(urlString) method. Examples An example of setting a proxy server with HTTP protocol on port 1234 with no authentication: $network.setProxyForHttp('http://host.com:1234') Copy An example of setting a proxy server with HTTP protocol with authentication credentials. $network.setProxyForHttp('http://proxyUsername:proxyPassword@proxyHost:1234') Copy $network.setProxyForHttps(string or object PROXY URL) Tip This call is exactly the same as the per-URL setProxy call, except that it applies to HTTPS traffic. Sets a proxy server to be used for all HTTPS requests. Additional notes: The port is optional. If not provided, it will be derived from the scheme. For example, for HTTP the default port would be 443. The username and password are assumed to be the result of a call to encodeURIComponent(). Special characters like @ and : in the username and/or the password must be escaped. Returns This method returns a Promise that will resolve once the configuration has been applied. Parameters Parameter Data Type Description proxyURL | proxyUrlParsed String or Object The URL to connect to the proxy server. A string containing a proxyURL (for example, http://proxy_host:8888) or a plain object in the same format as defined by Node's url.parse(urlString) method. Examples An example of setting a proxy server with HTTPS protocol on port 1234 with no authentication: $network.setProxyForHttps('https://host.com:1234') Copy An example of setting a proxy server with HTTPS protocol with authentication credentials. $network.setProxyForHttps('https://proxyUsername:proxyPassword@proxyHost:1234') Copy $network.setProxyPAC(string PAC SCRIPT URL, object AUTH OBJECT) Sets a proxy server via a proxy auto-config (PAC) script and returns a promise. This function is only available for scripted browser monitors. Returns This method returns a Promise that will resolve once the configuration has been applied. Parameters Parameter Data Type Description scriptURL String The URL of the PAC script. authCredentialsMap Object Map of authentication credentials to be provided to the proxy server(s), keyed by the hostnames of the proxy server. Values of this map must be defined in the format {username: 'authUsername', password: 'authPassword'} Examples An example of setting a proxy server via a proxy auto-config (PAC) script: var authCredentialsMap = { 'example.com': {username: 'authUsername', password: 'authPassword'}, } Copy $network.setProxyAdvanced(object PROXY RULES OBJECT) Tip This method is Chrome-specific: it only applies to scripted browser monitor types. It can be used to allow for a more flexible and complex proxy configuration. In most cases, this method will not be needed. Sets the proxy configuration using the format supported by Chrome Extension API for Proxying. The input is a ProxyRules object, as defined by the Chrome Extension API to configures proxies. You can add authCredentials for proxies that need it. See Parameters for more details. Returns This method returns a Promise that will resolve once the configuration has been applied. Parameters Parameter Data Type Description ProxyRules Object Object The proxyRulesObject is a plain object that follows the format ProxyRules as defined by the Chrome Extension API to configures proxies. This object is \"flavoured\" to fit our runtime: users can define an additional property, authCredentials, for the Proxy server objects to provide authentication credentials for a specific proxy server. authCredentials is an object in the format {username: 'authUsername', password: 'authPassword'}. Examples Here's an example of creating a proxyRules with authCredentials: var proxyRules = { singleProxy: { host:\"example.com\", authCredentials: { username: 'authUsername', password: 'authPassword' } } }; Copy Here's an example of setting up a proxied network with mixed network zone assets: var proxyRules = {singleProxy: {host:\"http://entproxy.mycompany.com\"}, bypassList:['s3.amazonaws.com','*.localcdn.com'] } $network.setProxyAdvanced(proxyRules) Copy $network.clearProxy() Clears/removes the current proxy configuration. Returns This method returns a Promise that will resolve once the configuration has been applied. $network.getProxy() This method returns the current proxy configuration. It must be synchronized in a promise callback. Examples An example of synchronizing getProxy with $network.setProxy(); and $network.clearProxy();: var assert = require('assert'); $network.setProxy(\"http://user:password@myproxyurl.com\") .then(function () { console.log('Proxy configuration applied'); //Note: $network.getProxy() is not synchronized with the webdriver Control Flow. //To make sure we get the proxy configuration after the call to setProxy() above // succeeds we need to use a promise callback var proxyData = $network.getProxy(); console.log(proxyData); }) .then(function () { // Again: getProxy() is not synchronized with the Webdriver Control Flow: we //need this promise callback otherwise clearProxy() might be called before the call // to getProxy() above returns return $network.clearProxy(); }) .then(function () { console.log('Proxy configuration cleared'); // We need this promise callback for reasons explained above var proxyData = $network.getProxy(); assert.equal(proxyData.rules, null); }); Copy Proxy properties Important This proxy information applies only to these versions: API monitors: 0.4.0, 0.2.2, 0.2.1, 0.1.0 Scripted monitors: 0.1.0 In order to analyze and collect your HTTP traffic metrics, New Relic must ensure the traffic passes through a conceptual funnel. Our synthetic monitoring includes a software funnel component capable of analyzing the HTTP requests or responses and then recording the information. New Relic's scripted browser monitors (versions 0.4.x and lower) include a mechanism to do this analysis without needing an HTTP proxy, so you don't have to configure anything. New Relic's API test (versions 0.4.x and lower) provides an $http object that is pre-configured to make the requests pass through the internal HTTP proxy. This allows you to write your test without including any proxy settings. If you want to use some other way to generate HTTP traffic while still collecting the HTTP traffic metrics, you can use $env.PROXY_HOST and $env.PROXY_PORT. To record traffic metrics, be sure to include these properties in your script.

      "body": "Synthetic monitors are API checks or virtual browser instances that monitor your website, recording each check in detail. They can also capture aggregate numbers, including an overview, or summary for ping monitors, detailed statistics for each page resource, and downtime incidents. Synthetic monitoring also collects custom response codes for more detail on your monitor runs. For a description of synthetic monitor types, see Types of monitor. Add a monitor There are several types of synthetic monitor to add. Ping monitors ensure your website is responding, while simple browser monitors send real browsers to check your website. For more complex monitoring, scripted browser monitors verify that specific resources are present, while API tests verify your API endpoint. Add a ping or simple browser monitor Go to one.newrelic.com > Synthetics > Create monitor. Specify a monitor type, name, and URL. Optional: Add a validation string or Advanced options: A validation string is available for ping and simple browser. This option enables substring monitoring for response validation. Verify SSL is available for ping and simple browser. This option verifies the validity of the SSL certificate chain. It can be duplicated by running the following syntax: openssl s_client -servername {YOUR_HOSTNAME} -connect {YOUR_HOSTNAME}:443 -CApath /etc/ssl/certs -verify_hostname {YOUR_HOSTNAME} > /dev/null Copy If a non-zero exit code is returned, the monitor will fail. The Bypass HEAD request option is available for ping. This option skips the default HEAD request and instead uses the GET verb with a ping check. Redirect is Failure is available for ping.

Select the period to determine your monitor's frequency. Optional: Add tags to help you find this monitor later. Select the locations from which you want your monitor to run, and then click Save monitor to confirm. Wait a few minutes, then check your monitor from the Monitors index. Tip You can also use the Synthetics REST API to add monitors. For example, you can create a GET request to the monitor you want to use as the source for configuration, then use those key values to use in a POST to \"copy\" and create a new monitor. Edit a monitor To edit an existing monitor: From the Monitors tab in one.newrelic.com > Synthetics, select the monitor you want to edit. In the side menu, select a link to change the following settings: Select Settings > General to edit name, Apdex T, URL, locations, frequency, and advanced options. For Scripted browser and API test monitors, select Settings > Script to edit your monitor script. For synthetic monitoring alerts, click Manage alerts. Select Save changes to confirm. Important You cannot change a monitor's type after the monitor is created. Delete a monitor To delete a monitor: From the Monitors tab in one.newrelic.com > Synthetics, select the monitor you want to edit. From the selected monitor, select Settings > General. Scroll to the bottom of the page and select the trash can icon. Tip You can also use the Synthetics REST API to delete a monitor. Monitor settings When configuring monitors, the following settings are available: Type Select the type of monitor you want to create. A monitor's type can't be changed after the monitor is created. Ping: Specify a single URL to monitor for availability. New Relic will check this URL via HEAD or GET requests. The non-configurable timeout for this monitor is 60 seconds. Simple browser: Specify a single URL to monitor via real browser. Once each frequency interval, New Relic will check this URL via a Selenium-powered Google Chrome browser. The non-configurable timeout for this monitor is 60 seconds. Scripted browser: Create a script to drive a Selenium-powered Google Chrome browser. The browser follows each step in the script to verify that complex behavior is working as expected (for example, searching a website, then clicking one of the search results). The non-configurable timeout for this monitor is 180 seconds. API test: Create an API script to ensure your API endpoint is working correctly. For more information, see Write API tests. The non-configurable timeout for this monitor is 180 seconds. Monitor name Defines a name for the monitor. Monitor names cannot contain unencoded angle brackets (< >). To include angle brackets in a monitor name, encode them as HTML bracket entities (&lt; &gt;) in the UI or API. Location Select the locations where you want your monitor to run. Select more locations to ensure that your application is available to users around the world. If you have any private locations, they will be listed here too. You can use the Synthetics API location endpoint to retrieve a list of valid locations for your account. Your monitor will run one check from each selected location during each frequency interval. For example, if you select three locations and define a frequency of 15 minutes, your monitor will run three checks in each 15 minute period (or 8,640 checks per month). Frequency Select how often the monitor runs, in increments of minutes, hours, or 1 day. This frequency applies to each location. For example, if you select three locations and a Frequency of 15 minutes, your monitor will run three checks, on average every 5 minutes, in each 15 minute period (or 8,640 checks per month). Alerts Specify an email address to receive alerts when a monitor fails. Or, attach a monitor to an existing alert policy for more notification options. For more information, see Alerting for synthetic monitoring. Apdex T Customize the Apdex T for this monitor. This setting is only available when editing the settings for an existing monitor, not when creating a new monitor. Change the Apdex T from the default 7 seconds for more accurate Apdex scores in your SLA reports. For example, if you have a very long scripted browser, you might adjust the Apdex T to 15 seconds to more closely reflect the usual completion time. Similarly, a good Apdex T for a simple browser check might be only 2 seconds. Response Validation (optional) Specify text to search for on the page. When using simple browser or ping monitor types, there is a 1MB (10^6 bytes) limit on the page load.

Understand SLA report metrics Use SLA reports to view aggregated performance metrics for a single monitor, or for all your monitors from the account-wide SLA Reports page. SLA reports include the following metrics: Duration: The average duration across all monitor results. Uptime: The percentage of all monitor results that ended successfully. For example, Monitor A might check 50 times per day, and Monitor B might check 150 times per day. If Monitor A has 29 successes out of 50 and Monitor B has 148 successes out of 150, the Uptime would be 88.5: (29+148)/(50+150)=88.5 For individual SLA reports, the uptime score only includes the selected monitor. Apdex: The average Apdex across all monitors. Monitors have a default Apdex T of 7 seconds, but you can customize Apdex T for individual monitors by editing their settings. Apdex F, which defines a frustrating result, is always four times Apdex T. For more information about Apdex, see Apdex: Measuring user satisfaction. For individual SLA reports, the Apdex score only includes the selected monitor. % Satisfied: The percentage of monitor results which complete in a \"satisfying\" time. A satisfying time is defined as a monitor result that completes in Apdex T or less. % Toleration: The percentage of monitor results which complete in a \"tolerable\" time. A tolerable time is greater than Apdex T, but less than Apdex F (four times Apdex T). % Frustrated: The percentage of monitor results which complete in a \"frustrating\" time.

      "body": "Read on to learn about synthetic monitoring's proxy settings and properties. Proxy settings API for scripted monitors Important You can set proxy server configuration for synthetic scripted monitors for monitor versions 0.4.0 or higher. The global object $network allows you to control the network configuration used by your synthetic scripted monitors. The following are applicable for both scripted browsers and API tests, unless otherwise stated. $network.setProxy(string or object PROXY URL) Sets a proxy server to be used for all per-URL requests (HTTP, HTTPS, and FTP). Additional notes: The port is optional. If not provided, it will be derived from the scheme. For example, for HTTP the port would be 80. The username and password are assumed to be the result of a call to encodeURIComponent(). Special characters like @ and : in the username and/or the password must be escaped. Returns This method returns a Promise that will resolve once the configuration has been applied. Parameters Parameter Data Type Description proxyURL | proxyUrlParsed String or Object The URL to connect to the proxy server. A string containing a proxyURL (for example, http://proxy_host:8888) or a plain object in the same format as defined by Node's url.parse(urlString) method. Examples An example of setting a proxy server with HTTP protocol on port 1234 with no authentication: $network.setProxy('http://host.com:1234') Copy An example of setting a proxy server with HTTP protocol with authentication credentials. $network.setProxy('http://proxyUsername:proxyPassword@proxyHost:1234') Copy $network.setProxyForHttp(string or object PROXY URL) Tip This call is exactly the same as the per-URL setProxy call, except that it applies to HTTP traffic. Sets a proxy server to be used for all HTTP requests. Additional notes: The port is optional. If not provided, it will be derived from the scheme. For example, for HTTP the port would be 80. The username and password are assumed to be the result of a call to encodeURIComponent(). Special characters like @ and : in the username and/or the password must be escaped. Returns This method returns a Promise that will resolve once the configuration has been applied. Parameters Parameter Data Type Description proxyURL | proxyUrlParsed String or Object The URL to connect to the proxy server. A string containing a proxyURL (for example, http://proxy_host:8888) or a plain object in the same format as defined by Node's url.parse(urlString) method. Examples An example of setting a proxy server with HTTP protocol on port 1234 with no authentication: $network.setProxyForHttp('http://host.com:1234') Copy An example of setting a proxy server with HTTP protocol with authentication credentials. $network.setProxyForHttp('http://proxyUsername:proxyPassword@proxyHost:1234') Copy $network.setProxyForHttps(string or object PROXY URL) Tip This call is exactly the same as the per-URL setProxy call, except that it applies to HTTPS traffic. Sets a proxy server to be used for all HTTPS requests. Additional notes: The port is optional. If not provided, it will be derived from the scheme. For example, for HTTP the default port would be 443. The username and password are assumed to be the result of a call to encodeURIComponent(). Special characters like @ and : in the username and/or the password must be escaped. Returns This method returns a Promise that will resolve once the configuration has been applied. Parameters Parameter Data Type Description proxyURL | proxyUrlParsed String or Object The URL to connect to the proxy server. A string containing a proxyURL (for example, http://proxy_host:8888) or a plain object in the same format as defined by Node's url.parse(urlString) method. Examples An example of setting a proxy server with HTTPS protocol on port 1234 with no authentication: $network.setProxyForHttps('https://host.com:1234') Copy An example of setting a proxy server with HTTPS protocol with authentication credentials. $network.setProxyForHttps('https://proxyUsername:proxyPassword@proxyHost:1234') Copy $network.setProxyPAC(string PAC SCRIPT URL, object AUTH OBJECT) Sets a proxy server via a proxy auto-config (PAC) script and returns a promise. This function is only available for scripted browser monitors. Returns This method returns a Promise that will resolve once the configuration has been applied. Parameters Parameter Data Type Description scriptURL String The URL of the PAC script. authCredentialsMap Object Map of authentication credentials to be provided to the proxy server(s), keyed by the hostnames of the proxy server. Values of this map must be defined in the format {username: 'authUsername', password: 'authPassword'} Examples An example of setting a proxy server via a proxy auto-config (PAC) script: var authCredentialsMap = { 'example.com': {username: 'authUsername', password: 'authPassword'}, } Copy $network.setProxyAdvanced(object PROXY RULES OBJECT) Tip This method is Chrome-specific: it only applies to scripted browser monitor types. It can be used to allow for a more flexible and complex proxy configuration. In most cases, this method will not be needed. Sets the proxy configuration using the format supported by Chrome Extension API for Proxying. The input is a ProxyRules object, as defined by the Chrome Extension API to configures proxies. You can add authCredentials for proxies that need it. See Parameters for more details. Returns This method returns a Promise that will resolve once the configuration has been applied. Parameters Parameter Data Type Description ProxyRules Object Object The proxyRulesObject is a plain object that follows the format ProxyRules as defined by the Chrome Extension API to configures proxies. This object is \"flavoured\" to fit our runtime: users can define an additional property, authCredentials, for the Proxy server objects to provide authentication credentials for a specific proxy server. authCredentials is an object in the format {username: 'authUsername', password: 'authPassword'}. Examples Here's an example of creating a proxyRules with authCredentials: var proxyRules = { singleProxy: { host:\"example.com\", authCredentials: { username: 'authUsername', password: 'authPassword' } } }; Copy Here's an example of setting up a proxied network with mixed network zone assets: var proxyRules = {singleProxy: {host:\"http://entproxy.mycompany.com\"}, bypassList:['s3.amazonaws.com','*.localcdn.com'] } $network.setProxyAdvanced(proxyRules) Copy $network.clearProxy() Clears/removes the current proxy configuration. Returns This method returns a Promise that will resolve once the configuration has been applied. $network.getProxy() This method returns the current proxy configuration. It must be synchronized in a promise callback. Examples An example of synchronizing getProxy with $network.setProxy(); and $network.clearProxy();: var assert = require('assert'); $network.setProxy(\"http://user:password@myproxyurl.com\") .then(function () { console.log('Proxy configuration applied'); //Note: $network.getProxy() is not synchronized with the webdriver Control Flow. //To make sure we get the proxy configuration after the call to setProxy() above // succeeds we need to use a promise callback var proxyData = $network.getProxy(); console.log(proxyData); }) .then(function () { // Again: getProxy() is not synchronized with the Webdriver Control Flow: we //need this promise callback otherwise clearProxy() might be called before the call // to getProxy() above returns return $network.clearProxy(); }) .then(function () { console.log('Proxy configuration cleared'); // We need this promise callback for reasons explained above var proxyData = $network.getProxy(); assert.equal(proxyData.rules, null); }); Copy Proxy properties Important This proxy information applies only to these versions: API monitors: 0.4.0, 0.2.2, 0.2.1, 0.1.0 Scripted monitors: 0.1.0 In order to analyze and collect your HTTP traffic metrics, New Relic must ensure the traffic passes through a conceptual funnel. Our synthetic monitoring includes a software funnel component capable of analyzing the HTTP requests or responses and then recording the information. New Relic's scripted browser monitors (versions 0.4.x and lower) include a mechanism to do this analysis without needing an HTTP proxy, so you don't have to configure anything. New Relic's API test (versions 0.4.x and lower) provides an $http object that is pre-configured to make the requests pass through the internal HTTP proxy. This allows you to write your test without including any proxy settings. If you want to use some other way to generate HTTP traffic while still collecting the HTTP traffic metrics, you can use $env.PROXY_HOST and $env.PROXY_PORT. To record traffic metrics, be sure to include these properties in your script.

      "body": "Synthetic monitors are API checks or virtual browser instances that monitor your website, recording each check in detail. They can also capture aggregate numbers, including an overview, or summary for ping monitors, detailed statistics for each page resource, and downtime incidents. Synthetic monitoring also collects custom response codes for more detail on your monitor runs. For a description of synthetic monitor types, see Types of monitor. Add a monitor There are several types of synthetic monitor to add. Ping monitors ensure your website is responding, while simple browser monitors send real browsers to check your website. For more complex monitoring, scripted browser monitors verify that specific resources are present, while API tests verify your API endpoint. Add a ping or simple browser monitor Go to one.newrelic.com > Synthetics > Create monitor. Specify a monitor type, name, and URL. Optional: Add a validation string or Advanced options: A validation string is available for ping and simple browser. This option enables substring monitoring for response validation. Verify SSL is available for ping and simple browser. This option verifies the validity of the SSL certificate chain. It can be duplicated by running the following syntax: openssl s_client -servername {YOUR_HOSTNAME} -connect {YOUR_HOSTNAME}:443 -CApath /etc/ssl/certs -verify_hostname {YOUR_HOSTNAME} > /dev/null Copy If a non-zero exit code is returned, the monitor will fail. The Bypass HEAD request option is available for ping. This option skips the default HEAD request and instead uses the GET verb with a ping check. Redirect is Failure is available for ping.

For example, you can create a GET request to the monitor you want to use as the source for configuration, then use those key values to use in a POST to \"copy\" and create a new monitor. Edit a monitor To edit an existing monitor: From the Monitors tab in one.newrelic.com > Synthetics, select the monitor you want to edit. In the side menu, select a link to change the following settings: Select Settings > General to edit name, Apdex T, URL, locations, frequency, and advanced options. For Scripted browser and API test monitors, select Settings > Script to edit your monitor script. For synthetic monitoring alerts, click Manage alerts. Select Save changes to confirm. Important You cannot change a monitor's type after the monitor is created. Delete a monitor To delete a monitor: From the Monitors tab in one.newrelic.com > Synthetics, select the monitor you want to edit. From the selected monitor, select Settings > General. Scroll to the bottom of the page and select the trash can icon. Tip You can also use the Synthetics REST API to delete a monitor. Monitor settings When configuring monitors, the following settings are available: Type Select the type of monitor you want to create. A monitor's type can't be changed after the monitor is created. Ping: Specify a single URL to monitor for availability. New Relic will check this URL via HEAD or GET requests. The non-configurable timeout for this monitor is 60 seconds. Simple browser: Specify a single URL to monitor via real browser. Once each frequency interval, New Relic will check this URL via a Selenium-powered Google Chrome browser. The non-configurable timeout for this monitor is 60 seconds. Scripted browser: Create a script to drive a Selenium-powered Google Chrome browser. The browser follows each step in the script to verify that complex behavior is working as expected (for example, searching a website, then clicking one of the search results). The non-configurable timeout for this monitor is 180 seconds. API test: Create an API script to ensure your API endpoint is working correctly. For more information, see Write API tests. The non-configurable timeout for this monitor is 180 seconds. Monitor name Defines a name for the monitor. Monitor names cannot contain unencoded angle brackets (< >). To include angle brackets in a monitor name, encode them as HTML bracket entities (&lt; &gt;) in the UI or API. Location Select the locations where you want your monitor to run. Select more locations to ensure that your application is available to users around the world. If you have any private locations, they will be listed here too. You can use the Synthetics API location endpoint to retrieve a list of valid locations for your account. Your monitor will run one check from each selected location during each frequency interval. For example, if you select three locations and define a frequency of 15 minutes, your monitor will run three checks in each 15 minute period (or 8,640 checks per month). Frequency Select how often the monitor runs, in increments of minutes, hours, or 1 day. This frequency applies to each location. For example, if you select three locations and a Frequency of 15 minutes, your monitor will run three checks, on average every 5 minutes, in each 15 minute period (or 8,640 checks per month). Alerts Specify an email address to receive alerts when a monitor fails. Or, attach a monitor to an existing alert policy for more notification options. For more information, see Alerting for synthetic monitoring. Apdex T Customize the Apdex T for this monitor. This setting is only available when editing the settings for an existing monitor, not when creating a new monitor. Change the Apdex T from the default 7 seconds for more accurate Apdex scores in your SLA reports. For example, if you have a very long scripted browser, you might adjust the Apdex T to 15 seconds to more closely reflect the usual completion time. Similarly, a good Apdex T for a simple browser check might be only 2 seconds. Response Validation (optional) Specify text to search for on the page. When using simple browser or ping monitor types, there is a 1MB (10^6 bytes) limit on the page load.

Understand SLA report metrics Use SLA reports to view aggregated performance metrics for a single monitor, or for all your monitors from the account-wide SLA Reports page. SLA reports include the following metrics: Duration: The average duration across all monitor results. Uptime: The percentage of all monitor results that ended successfully. For example, Monitor A might check 50 times per day, and Monitor B might check 150 times per day. If Monitor A has 29 successes out of 50 and Monitor B has 148 successes out of 150, the Uptime would be 88.5: (29+148)/(50+150)=88.5 For individual SLA reports, the uptime score only includes the selected monitor. Apdex: The average Apdex across all monitors. Monitors have a default Apdex T of 7 seconds, but you can customize Apdex T for individual monitors by editing their settings. Apdex F, which defines a frustrating result, is always four times Apdex T. For more information about Apdex, see Apdex: Measuring user satisfaction. For individual SLA reports, the Apdex score only includes the selected monitor. % Satisfied: The percentage of monitor results which complete in a \"satisfying\" time. A satisfying time is defined as a monitor result that completes in Apdex T or less. % Toleration: The percentage of monitor results which complete in a \"tolerable\" time. A tolerable time is greater than Apdex T, but less than Apdex F (four times Apdex T). % Frustrated: The percentage of monitor results which complete in a \"frustrating\" time. A frustrating time is greater than Apdex F (four times Apdex T). The account-wide SLA report includes all monitor types (ping, simple browser, scripted browser, and API test).

      "body": "Read on to learn about synthetic monitoring's proxy settings and properties. Proxy settings API for scripted monitors Important You can set proxy server configuration for synthetic scripted monitors for monitor versions 0.4.0 or higher. The global object $network allows you to control the network configuration used by your synthetic scripted monitors. The following are applicable for both scripted browsers and API tests, unless otherwise stated. $network.setProxy(string or object PROXY URL) Sets a proxy server to be used for all per-URL requests (HTTP, HTTPS, and FTP). Additional notes: The port is optional. If not provided, it will be derived from the scheme. For example, for HTTP the port would be 80. The username and password are assumed to be the result of a call to encodeURIComponent(). Special characters like @ and : in the username and/or the password must be escaped. Returns This method returns a Promise that will resolve once the configuration has been applied. Parameters Parameter Data Type Description proxyURL | proxyUrlParsed String or Object The URL to connect to the proxy server. A string containing a proxyURL (for example, http://proxy_host:8888) or a plain object in the same format as defined by Node's url.parse(urlString) method. Examples An example of setting a proxy server with HTTP protocol on port 1234 with no authentication: $network.setProxy('http://host.com:1234') Copy An example of setting a proxy server with HTTP protocol with authentication credentials. $network.setProxy('http://proxyUsername:proxyPassword@proxyHost:1234') Copy $network.setProxyForHttp(string or object PROXY URL) Tip This call is exactly the same as the per-URL setProxy call, except that it applies to HTTP traffic. Sets a proxy server to be used for all HTTP requests. Additional notes: The port is optional. If not provided, it will be derived from the scheme. For example, for HTTP the port would be 80. The username and password are assumed to be the result of a call to encodeURIComponent(). Special characters like @ and : in the username and/or the password must be escaped. Returns This method returns a Promise that will resolve once the configuration has been applied. Parameters Parameter Data Type Description proxyURL | proxyUrlParsed String or Object The URL to connect to the proxy server. A string containing a proxyURL (for example, http://proxy_host:8888) or a plain object in the same format as defined by Node's url.parse(urlString) method. Examples An example of setting a proxy server with HTTP protocol on port 1234 with no authentication: $network.setProxyForHttp('http://host.com:1234') Copy An example of setting a proxy server with HTTP protocol with authentication credentials. $network.setProxyForHttp('http://proxyUsername:proxyPassword@proxyHost:1234') Copy $network.setProxyForHttps(string or object PROXY URL) Tip This call is exactly the same as the per-URL setProxy call, except that it applies to HTTPS traffic. Sets a proxy server to be used for all HTTPS requests. Additional notes: The port is optional. If not provided, it will be derived from the scheme. For example, for HTTP the default port would be 443. The username and password are assumed to be the result of a call to encodeURIComponent(). Special characters like @ and : in the username and/or the password must be escaped. Returns This method returns a Promise that will resolve once the configuration has been applied. Parameters Parameter Data Type Description proxyURL | proxyUrlParsed String or Object The URL to connect to the proxy server. A string containing a proxyURL (for example, http://proxy_host:8888) or a plain object in the same format as defined by Node's url.parse(urlString) method. Examples An example of setting a proxy server with HTTPS protocol on port 1234 with no authentication: $network.setProxyForHttps('https://host.com:1234') Copy An example of setting a proxy server with HTTPS protocol with authentication credentials. $network.setProxyForHttps('https://proxyUsername:proxyPassword@proxyHost:1234') Copy $network.setProxyPAC(string PAC SCRIPT URL, object AUTH OBJECT) Sets a proxy server via a proxy auto-config (PAC) script and returns a promise. This function is only available for scripted browser monitors. Returns This method returns a Promise that will resolve once the configuration has been applied. Parameters Parameter Data Type Description scriptURL String The URL of the PAC script. authCredentialsMap Object Map of authentication credentials to be provided to the proxy server(s), keyed by the hostnames of the proxy server. Values of this map must be defined in the format {username: 'authUsername', password: 'authPassword'} Examples An example of setting a proxy server via a proxy auto-config (PAC) script: var authCredentialsMap = { 'example.com': {username: 'authUsername', password: 'authPassword'}, } Copy $network.setProxyAdvanced(object PROXY RULES OBJECT) Tip This method is Chrome-specific: it only applies to scripted browser monitor types. It can be used to allow for a more flexible and complex proxy configuration. In most cases, this method will not be needed. Sets the proxy configuration using the format supported by Chrome Extension API for Proxying. The input is a ProxyRules object, as defined by the Chrome Extension API to configures proxies. You can add authCredentials for proxies that need it. See Parameters for more details. Returns This method returns a Promise that will resolve once the configuration has been applied. Parameters Parameter Data Type Description ProxyRules Object Object The proxyRulesObject is a plain object that follows the format ProxyRules as defined by the Chrome Extension API to configures proxies. This object is \"flavoured\" to fit our runtime: users can define an additional property, authCredentials, for the Proxy server objects to provide authentication credentials for a specific proxy server. authCredentials is an object in the format {username: 'authUsername', password: 'authPassword'}. Examples Here's an example of creating a proxyRules with authCredentials: var proxyRules = { singleProxy: { host:\"example.com\", authCredentials: { username: 'authUsername', password: 'authPassword' } } }; Copy Here's an example of setting up a proxied network with mixed network zone assets: var proxyRules = {singleProxy: {host:\"http://entproxy.mycompany.com\"}, bypassList:['s3.amazonaws.com','*.localcdn.com'] } $network.setProxyAdvanced(proxyRules) Copy $network.clearProxy() Clears/removes the current proxy configuration. Returns This method returns a Promise that will resolve once the configuration has been applied. $network.getProxy() This method returns the current proxy configuration. It must be synchronized in a promise callback. Examples An example of synchronizing getProxy with $network.setProxy(); and $network.clearProxy();: var assert = require('assert'); $network.setProxy(\"http://user:password@myproxyurl.com\") .then(function () { console.log('Proxy configuration applied'); //Note: $network.getProxy() is not synchronized with the webdriver Control Flow. //To make sure we get the proxy configuration after the call to setProxy() above // succeeds we need to use a promise callback var proxyData = $network.getProxy(); console.log(proxyData); }) .then(function () { // Again: getProxy() is not synchronized with the Webdriver Control Flow: we //need this promise callback otherwise clearProxy() might be called before the call // to getProxy() above returns return $network.clearProxy(); }) .then(function () { console.log('Proxy configuration cleared'); // We need this promise callback for reasons explained above var proxyData = $network.getProxy(); assert.equal(proxyData.rules, null); }); Copy Proxy properties Important This proxy information applies only to these versions: API monitors: 0.4.0, 0.2.2, 0.2.1, 0.1.0 Scripted monitors: 0.1.0 In order to analyze and collect your HTTP traffic metrics, New Relic must ensure the traffic passes through a conceptual funnel. Our synthetic monitoring includes a software funnel component capable of analyzing the HTTP requests or responses and then recording the information. New Relic's scripted browser monitors (versions 0.4.x and lower) include a mechanism to do this analysis without needing an HTTP proxy, so you don't have to configure anything. New Relic's API test (versions 0.4.x and lower) provides an $http object that is pre-configured to make the requests pass through the internal HTTP proxy. This allows you to write your test without including any proxy settings. If you want to use some other way to generate HTTP traffic while still collecting the HTTP traffic metrics, you can use $env.PROXY_HOST and $env.PROXY_PORT. To record traffic metrics, be sure to include these properties in your script.

      "body": "Synthetic monitors are API checks or virtual browser instances that monitor your website, recording each check in detail. They can also capture aggregate numbers, including an overview, or summary for ping monitors, detailed statistics for each page resource, and downtime incidents. Synthetic monitoring also collects custom response codes for more detail on your monitor runs. For a description of synthetic monitor types, see Types of monitor. Add a monitor There are several types of synthetic monitor to add. Ping monitors ensure your website is responding, while simple browser monitors send real browsers to check your website. For more complex monitoring, scripted browser monitors verify that specific resources are present, while API tests verify your API endpoint. Add a ping or simple browser monitor Go to one.newrelic.com > Synthetics > Create monitor. Specify a monitor type, name, and URL. Optional: Add a validation string or Advanced options: A validation string is available for ping and simple browser. This option enables substring monitoring for response validation. Verify SSL is available for ping and simple browser. This option verifies the validity of the SSL certificate chain. It can be duplicated by running the following syntax: openssl s_client -servername {YOUR_HOSTNAME} -connect {YOUR_HOSTNAME}:443 -CApath /etc/ssl/certs -verify_hostname {YOUR_HOSTNAME} > /dev/null Copy If a non-zero exit code is returned, the monitor will fail. The Bypass HEAD request option is available for ping. This option skips the default HEAD request and instead uses the GET verb with a ping check. Redirect is Failure is available for ping. If a redirect result occurs when Redirect is Failure is enabled, New Relic Synthetics will categorize the result as a failure, rather than following the redirect and checking the resulting URL.

In the side menu, select a link to change the following settings: Select Settings > General to edit name, Apdex T, URL, locations, frequency, and advanced options. For Scripted browser and API test monitors, select Settings > Script to edit your monitor script. For synthetic monitoring alerts, click Manage alerts. Select Save changes to confirm. Important You cannot change a monitor's type after the monitor is created. Delete a monitor To delete a monitor: From the Monitors tab in one.newrelic.com > Synthetics, select the monitor you want to edit. From the selected monitor, select Settings > General. Scroll to the bottom of the page and select the trash can icon. Tip You can also use the Synthetics REST API to delete a monitor. Monitor settings When configuring monitors, the following settings are available: Type Select the type of monitor you want to create. A monitor's type can't be changed after the monitor is created. Ping: Specify a single URL to monitor for availability. New Relic will check this URL via HEAD or GET requests. The non-configurable timeout for this monitor is 60 seconds. Simple browser: Specify a single URL to monitor via real browser. Once each frequency interval, New Relic will check this URL via a Selenium-powered Google Chrome browser. The non-configurable timeout for this monitor is 60 seconds. Scripted browser: Create a script to drive a Selenium-powered Google Chrome browser. The browser follows each step in the script to verify that complex behavior is working as expected (for example, searching a website, then clicking one of the search results). The non-configurable timeout for this monitor is 180 seconds. API test: Create an API script to ensure your API endpoint is working correctly. For more information, see Write API tests. The non-configurable timeout for this monitor is 180 seconds. Monitor name Defines a name for the monitor. Monitor names cannot contain unencoded angle brackets (< >). To include angle brackets in a monitor name, encode them as HTML bracket entities (&lt; &gt;) in the UI or API. Location Select the locations where you want your monitor to run. Select more locations to ensure that your application is available to users around the world. If you have any private locations, they will be listed here too. You can use the Synthetics API location endpoint to retrieve a list of valid locations for your account. Your monitor will run one check from each selected location during each frequency interval. For example, if you select three locations and define a frequency of 15 minutes, your monitor will run three checks in each 15 minute period (or 8,640 checks per month). Frequency Select how often the monitor runs, in increments of minutes, hours, or 1 day. This frequency applies to each location. For example, if you select three locations and a Frequency of 15 minutes, your monitor will run three checks, on average every 5 minutes, in each 15 minute period (or 8,640 checks per month). Alerts Specify an email address to receive alerts when a monitor fails. Or, attach a monitor to an existing alert policy for more notification options. For more information, see Alerting for synthetic monitoring. Apdex T Customize the Apdex T for this monitor. This setting is only available when editing the settings for an existing monitor, not when creating a new monitor. Change the Apdex T from the default 7 seconds for more accurate Apdex scores in your SLA reports. For example, if you have a very long scripted browser, you might adjust the Apdex T to 15 seconds to more closely reflect the usual completion time. Similarly, a good Apdex T for a simple browser check might be only 2 seconds. Response Validation (optional) Specify text to search for on the page. When using simple browser or ping monitor types, there is a 1MB (10^6 bytes) limit on the page load.

You can also view SLA reports for individual monitors: Go to one.newrelic.com > Synthetics > (select a monitor) > SLA. one.newrelic.com > Synthetics > SLA Report: Use SLA reports to understand your monitors' performance over time. Understand SLA report metrics Use SLA reports to view aggregated performance metrics for a single monitor, or for all your monitors from the account-wide SLA Reports page. SLA reports include the following metrics: Duration: The average duration across all monitor results. Uptime: The percentage of all monitor results that ended successfully. For example, Monitor A might check 50 times per day, and Monitor B might check 150 times per day. If Monitor A has 29 successes out of 50 and Monitor B has 148 successes out of 150, the Uptime would be 88.5: (29+148)/(50+150)=88.5 For individual SLA reports, the uptime score only includes the selected monitor. Apdex: The average Apdex across all monitors. Monitors have a default Apdex T of 7 seconds, but you can customize Apdex T for individual monitors by editing their settings. Apdex F, which defines a frustrating result, is always four times Apdex T. For more information about Apdex, see Apdex: Measuring user satisfaction. For individual SLA reports, the Apdex score only includes the selected monitor. % Satisfied: The percentage of monitor results which complete in a \"satisfying\" time. A satisfying time is defined as a monitor result that completes in Apdex T or less. % Toleration: The percentage of monitor results which complete in a \"tolerable\" time. A tolerable time is greater than Apdex T, but less than Apdex F (four times Apdex T). % Frustrated: The percentage of monitor results which complete in a \"frustrating\" time. A frustrating time is greater than Apdex F (four times Apdex T). The account-wide SLA report includes all monitor types (ping, simple browser, scripted browser, and API test).

      "body": "Read on to learn about synthetic monitoring's proxy settings and properties. Proxy settings API for scripted monitors Important You can set proxy server configuration for synthetic scripted monitors for monitor versions 0.4.0 or higher. The global object $network allows you to control the network configuration used by your synthetic scripted monitors. The following are applicable for both scripted browsers and API tests, unless otherwise stated. $network.setProxy(string or object PROXY URL) Sets a proxy server to be used for all per-URL requests (HTTP, HTTPS, and FTP). Additional notes: The port is optional. If not provided, it will be derived from the scheme. For example, for HTTP the port would be 80. The username and password are assumed to be the result of a call to encodeURIComponent(). Special characters like @ and : in the username and/or the password must be escaped. Returns This method returns a Promise that will resolve once the configuration has been applied. Parameters Parameter Data Type Description proxyURL | proxyUrlParsed String or Object The URL to connect to the proxy server. A string containing a proxyURL (for example, http://proxy_host:8888) or a plain object in the same format as defined by Node's url.parse(urlString) method. Examples An example of setting a proxy server with HTTP protocol on port 1234 with no authentication: $network.setProxy('http://host.com:1234') Copy An example of setting a proxy server with HTTP protocol with authentication credentials. $network.setProxy('http://proxyUsername:proxyPassword@proxyHost:1234') Copy $network.setProxyForHttp(string or object PROXY URL) Tip This call is exactly the same as the per-URL setProxy call, except that it applies to HTTP traffic. Sets a proxy server to be used for all HTTP requests. Additional notes: The port is optional. If not provided, it will be derived from the scheme. For example, for HTTP the port would be 80. The username and password are assumed to be the result of a call to encodeURIComponent(). Special characters like @ and : in the username and/or the password must be escaped. Returns This method returns a Promise that will resolve once the configuration has been applied. Parameters Parameter Data Type Description proxyURL | proxyUrlParsed String or Object The URL to connect to the proxy server. A string containing a proxyURL (for example, http://proxy_host:8888) or a plain object in the same format as defined by Node's url.parse(urlString) method. Examples An example of setting a proxy server with HTTP protocol on port 1234 with no authentication: $network.setProxyForHttp('http://host.com:1234') Copy An example of setting a proxy server with HTTP protocol with authentication credentials. $network.setProxyForHttp('http://proxyUsername:proxyPassword@proxyHost:1234') Copy $network.setProxyForHttps(string or object PROXY URL) Tip This call is exactly the same as the per-URL setProxy call, except that it applies to HTTPS traffic. Sets a proxy server to be used for all HTTPS requests. Additional notes: The port is optional. If not provided, it will be derived from the scheme. For example, for HTTP the default port would be 443. The username and password are assumed to be the result of a call to encodeURIComponent(). Special characters like @ and : in the username and/or the password must be escaped. Returns This method returns a Promise that will resolve once the configuration has been applied. Parameters Parameter Data Type Description proxyURL | proxyUrlParsed String or Object The URL to connect to the proxy server. A string containing a proxyURL (for example, http://proxy_host:8888) or a plain object in the same format as defined by Node's url.parse(urlString) method. Examples An example of setting a proxy server with HTTPS protocol on port 1234 with no authentication: $network.setProxyForHttps('https://host.com:1234') Copy An example of setting a proxy server with HTTPS protocol with authentication credentials. $network.setProxyForHttps('https://proxyUsername:proxyPassword@proxyHost:1234') Copy $network.setProxyPAC(string PAC SCRIPT URL, object AUTH OBJECT) Sets a proxy server via a proxy auto-config (PAC) script and returns a promise. This function is only available for scripted browser monitors. Returns This method returns a Promise that will resolve once the configuration has been applied. Parameters Parameter Data Type Description scriptURL String The URL of the PAC script. authCredentialsMap Object Map of authentication credentials to be provided to the proxy server(s), keyed by the hostnames of the proxy server. Values of this map must be defined in the format {username: 'authUsername', password: 'authPassword'} Examples An example of setting a proxy server via a proxy auto-config (PAC) script: var authCredentialsMap = { 'example.com': {username: 'authUsername', password: 'authPassword'}, } Copy $network.setProxyAdvanced(object PROXY RULES OBJECT) Tip This method is Chrome-specific: it only applies to scripted browser monitor types. It can be used to allow for a more flexible and complex proxy configuration. In most cases, this method will not be needed. Sets the proxy configuration using the format supported by Chrome Extension API for Proxying. The input is a ProxyRules object, as defined by the Chrome Extension API to configures proxies. You can add authCredentials for proxies that need it. See Parameters for more details. Returns This method returns a Promise that will resolve once the configuration has been applied. Parameters Parameter Data Type Description ProxyRules Object Object The proxyRulesObject is a plain object that follows the format ProxyRules as defined by the Chrome Extension API to configures proxies. This object is \"flavoured\" to fit our runtime: users can define an additional property, authCredentials, for the Proxy server objects to provide authentication credentials for a specific proxy server. authCredentials is an object in the format {username: 'authUsername', password: 'authPassword'}. Examples Here's an example of creating a proxyRules with authCredentials: var proxyRules = { singleProxy: { host:\"example.com\", authCredentials: { username: 'authUsername', password: 'authPassword' } } }; Copy Here's an example of setting up a proxied network with mixed network zone assets: var proxyRules = {singleProxy: {host:\"http://entproxy.mycompany.com\"}, bypassList:['s3.amazonaws.com','*.localcdn.com'] } $network.setProxyAdvanced(proxyRules) Copy $network.clearProxy() Clears/removes the current proxy configuration. Returns This method returns a Promise that will resolve once the configuration has been applied. $network.getProxy() This method returns the current proxy configuration. It must be synchronized in a promise callback. Examples An example of synchronizing getProxy with $network.setProxy(); and $network.clearProxy();: var assert = require('assert'); $network.setProxy(\"http://user:password@myproxyurl.com\") .then(function () { console.log('Proxy configuration applied'); //Note: $network.getProxy() is not synchronized with the webdriver Control Flow. //To make sure we get the proxy configuration after the call to setProxy() above // succeeds we need to use a promise callback var proxyData = $network.getProxy(); console.log(proxyData); }) .then(function () { // Again: getProxy() is not synchronized with the Webdriver Control Flow: we //need this promise callback otherwise clearProxy() might be called before the call // to getProxy() above returns return $network.clearProxy(); }) .then(function () { console.log('Proxy configuration cleared'); // We need this promise callback for reasons explained above var proxyData = $network.getProxy(); assert.equal(proxyData.rules, null); }); Copy Proxy properties Important This proxy information applies only to these versions: API monitors: 0.4.0, 0.2.2, 0.2.1, 0.1.0 Scripted monitors: 0.1.0 In order to analyze and collect your HTTP traffic metrics, New Relic must ensure the traffic passes through a conceptual funnel. Our synthetic monitoring includes a software funnel component capable of analyzing the HTTP requests or responses and then recording the information. New Relic's scripted browser monitors (versions 0.4.x and lower) include a mechanism to do this analysis without needing an HTTP proxy, so you don't have to configure anything. New Relic's API test (versions 0.4.x and lower) provides an $http object that is pre-configured to make the requests pass through the internal HTTP proxy. This allows you to write your test without including any proxy settings. If you want to use some other way to generate HTTP traffic while still collecting the HTTP traffic metrics, you can use $env.PROXY_HOST and $env.PROXY_PORT. To record traffic metrics, be sure to include these properties in your script.

      "body": "Synthetic monitors are API checks or virtual browser instances that monitor your website, recording each check in detail. They can also capture aggregate numbers, including an overview, or summary for ping monitors, detailed statistics for each page resource, and downtime incidents. Synthetic monitoring also collects custom response codes for more detail on your monitor runs. For a description of synthetic monitor types, see Types of monitor. Add a monitor There are several types of synthetic monitor to add. Ping monitors ensure your website is responding, while simple browser monitors send real browsers to check your website. For more complex monitoring, scripted browser monitors verify that specific resources are present, while API tests verify your API endpoint. Add a ping or simple browser monitor Go to one.newrelic.com > Synthetics > Create monitor. Specify a monitor type, name, and URL. Optional: Add a validation string or Advanced options: A validation string is available for ping and simple browser. This option enables substring monitoring for response validation. Verify SSL is available for ping and simple browser. This option verifies the validity of the SSL certificate chain. It can be duplicated by running the following syntax: openssl s_client -servername {YOUR_HOSTNAME} -connect {YOUR_HOSTNAME}:443 -CApath /etc/ssl/certs -verify_hostname {YOUR_HOSTNAME} > /dev/null Copy If a non-zero exit code is returned, the monitor will fail. The Bypass HEAD request option is available for ping. This option skips the default HEAD request and instead uses the GET verb with a ping check. Redirect is Failure is available for ping. If a redirect result occurs when Redirect is Failure is enabled, New Relic Synthetics will categorize the result as a failure, rather than following the redirect and checking the resulting URL.

For Scripted browser and API test monitors, select Settings > Script to edit your monitor script. For synthetic monitoring alerts, click Manage alerts. Select Save changes to confirm. Important You cannot change a monitor's type after the monitor is created. Delete a monitor To delete a monitor: From the Monitors tab in one.newrelic.com > Synthetics, select the monitor you want to edit. From the selected monitor, select Settings > General. Scroll to the bottom of the page and select the trash can icon. Tip You can also use the Synthetics REST API to delete a monitor. Monitor settings When configuring monitors, the following settings are available: Type Select the type of monitor you want to create. A monitor's type can't be changed after the monitor is created. Ping: Specify a single URL to monitor for availability. New Relic will check this URL via HEAD or GET requests. The non-configurable timeout for this monitor is 60 seconds. Simple browser: Specify a single URL to monitor via real browser. Once each frequency interval, New Relic will check this URL via a Selenium-powered Google Chrome browser. The non-configurable timeout for this monitor is 60 seconds. Scripted browser: Create a script to drive a Selenium-powered Google Chrome browser. The browser follows each step in the script to verify that complex behavior is working as expected (for example, searching a website, then clicking one of the search results). The non-configurable timeout for this monitor is 180 seconds. API test: Create an API script to ensure your API endpoint is working correctly. For more information, see Write API tests. The non-configurable timeout for this monitor is 180 seconds. Monitor name Defines a name for the monitor. Monitor names cannot contain unencoded angle brackets (< >). To include angle brackets in a monitor name, encode them as HTML bracket entities (&lt; &gt;) in the UI or API. Location Select the locations where you want your monitor to run. Select more locations to ensure that your application is available to users around the world. If you have any private locations, they will be listed here too. You can use the Synthetics API location endpoint to retrieve a list of valid locations for your account. Your monitor will run one check from each selected location during each frequency interval. For example, if you select three locations and define a frequency of 15 minutes, your monitor will run three checks in each 15 minute period (or 8,640 checks per month). Frequency Select how often the monitor runs, in increments of minutes, hours, or 1 day. This frequency applies to each location. For example, if you select three locations and a Frequency of 15 minutes, your monitor will run three checks, on average every 5 minutes, in each 15 minute period (or 8,640 checks per month). Alerts Specify an email address to receive alerts when a monitor fails. Or, attach a monitor to an existing alert policy for more notification options. For more information, see Alerting for synthetic monitoring. Apdex T Customize the Apdex T for this monitor. This setting is only available when editing the settings for an existing monitor, not when creating a new monitor. Change the Apdex T from the default 7 seconds for more accurate Apdex scores in your SLA reports. For example, if you have a very long scripted browser, you might adjust the Apdex T to 15 seconds to more closely reflect the usual completion time. Similarly, a good Apdex T for a simple browser check might be only 2 seconds. Response Validation (optional) Specify text to search for on the page. When using simple browser or ping monitor types, there is a 1MB (10^6 bytes) limit on the page load.

You can also view SLA reports for individual monitors: Go to one.newrelic.com > Synthetics > (select a monitor) > SLA. one.newrelic.com > Synthetics > SLA Report: Use SLA reports to understand your monitors' performance over time. Understand SLA report metrics Use SLA reports to view aggregated performance metrics for a single monitor, or for all your monitors from the account-wide SLA Reports page. SLA reports include the following metrics: Duration: The average duration across all monitor results. Uptime: The percentage of all monitor results that ended successfully. For example, Monitor A might check 50 times per day, and Monitor B might check 150 times per day. If Monitor A has 29 successes out of 50 and Monitor B has 148 successes out of 150, the Uptime would be 88.5: (29+148)/(50+150)=88.5 For individual SLA reports, the uptime score only includes the selected monitor. Apdex: The average Apdex across all monitors. Monitors have a default Apdex T of 7 seconds, but you can customize Apdex T for individual monitors by editing their settings. Apdex F, which defines a frustrating result, is always four times Apdex T. For more information about Apdex, see Apdex: Measuring user satisfaction. For individual SLA reports, the Apdex score only includes the selected monitor. % Satisfied: The percentage of monitor results which complete in a \"satisfying\" time. A satisfying time is defined as a monitor result that completes in Apdex T or less. % Toleration: The percentage of monitor results which complete in a \"tolerable\" time. A tolerable time is greater than Apdex T, but less than Apdex F (four times Apdex T). % Frustrated: The percentage of monitor results which complete in a \"frustrating\" time. A frustrating time is greater than Apdex F (four times Apdex T). The account-wide SLA report includes all monitor types (ping, simple browser, scripted browser, and API test).

      "body": "Read on to learn about synthetic monitoring's proxy settings and properties. Proxy settings API for scripted monitors Important You can set proxy server configuration for synthetic scripted monitors for monitor versions 0.4.0 or higher. The global object $network allows you to control the network configuration used by your synthetic scripted monitors. The following are applicable for both scripted browsers and API tests, unless otherwise stated. $network.setProxy(string or object PROXY URL) Sets a proxy server to be used for all per-URL requests (HTTP, HTTPS, and FTP). Additional notes: The port is optional. If not provided, it will be derived from the scheme. For example, for HTTP the port would be 80. The username and password are assumed to be the result of a call to encodeURIComponent(). Special characters like @ and : in the username and/or the password must be escaped. Returns This method returns a Promise that will resolve once the configuration has been applied. Parameters Parameter Data Type Description proxyURL | proxyUrlParsed String or Object The URL to connect to the proxy server. A string containing a proxyURL (for example, http://proxy_host:8888) or a plain object in the same format as defined by Node's url.parse(urlString) method. Examples An example of setting a proxy server with HTTP protocol on port 1234 with no authentication: $network.setProxy('http://host.com:1234') Copy An example of setting a proxy server with HTTP protocol with authentication credentials. $network.setProxy('http://proxyUsername:proxyPassword@proxyHost:1234') Copy $network.setProxyForHttp(string or object PROXY URL) Tip This call is exactly the same as the per-URL setProxy call, except that it applies to HTTP traffic. Sets a proxy server to be used for all HTTP requests. Additional notes: The port is optional. If not provided, it will be derived from the scheme. For example, for HTTP the port would be 80. The username and password are assumed to be the result of a call to encodeURIComponent(). Special characters like @ and : in the username and/or the password must be escaped. Returns This method returns a Promise that will resolve once the configuration has been applied. Parameters Parameter Data Type Description proxyURL | proxyUrlParsed String or Object The URL to connect to the proxy server. A string containing a proxyURL (for example, http://proxy_host:8888) or a plain object in the same format as defined by Node's url.parse(urlString) method. Examples An example of setting a proxy server with HTTP protocol on port 1234 with no authentication: $network.setProxyForHttp('http://host.com:1234') Copy An example of setting a proxy server with HTTP protocol with authentication credentials. $network.setProxyForHttp('http://proxyUsername:proxyPassword@proxyHost:1234') Copy $network.setProxyForHttps(string or object PROXY URL) Tip This call is exactly the same as the per-URL setProxy call, except that it applies to HTTPS traffic. Sets a proxy server to be used for all HTTPS requests. Additional notes: The port is optional. If not provided, it will be derived from the scheme. For example, for HTTP the default port would be 443. The username and password are assumed to be the result of a call to encodeURIComponent(). Special characters like @ and : in the username and/or the password must be escaped. Returns This method returns a Promise that will resolve once the configuration has been applied. Parameters Parameter Data Type Description proxyURL | proxyUrlParsed String or Object The URL to connect to the proxy server. A string containing a proxyURL (for example, http://proxy_host:8888) or a plain object in the same format as defined by Node's url.parse(urlString) method. Examples An example of setting a proxy server with HTTPS protocol on port 1234 with no authentication: $network.setProxyForHttps('https://host.com:1234') Copy An example of setting a proxy server with HTTPS protocol with authentication credentials. $network.setProxyForHttps('https://proxyUsername:proxyPassword@proxyHost:1234') Copy $network.setProxyPAC(string PAC SCRIPT URL, object AUTH OBJECT) Sets a proxy server via a proxy auto-config (PAC) script and returns a promise. This function is only available for scripted browser monitors. Returns This method returns a Promise that will resolve once the configuration has been applied. Parameters Parameter Data Type Description scriptURL String The URL of the PAC script. authCredentialsMap Object Map of authentication credentials to be provided to the proxy server(s), keyed by the hostnames of the proxy server. Values of this map must be defined in the format {username: 'authUsername', password: 'authPassword'} Examples An example of setting a proxy server via a proxy auto-config (PAC) script: var authCredentialsMap = { 'example.com': {username: 'authUsername', password: 'authPassword'}, } Copy $network.setProxyAdvanced(object PROXY RULES OBJECT) Tip This method is Chrome-specific: it only applies to scripted browser monitor types. It can be used to allow for a more flexible and complex proxy configuration. In most cases, this method will not be needed. Sets the proxy configuration using the format supported by Chrome Extension API for Proxying. The input is a ProxyRules object, as defined by the Chrome Extension API to configures proxies. You can add authCredentials for proxies that need it. See Parameters for more details. Returns This method returns a Promise that will resolve once the configuration has been applied. Parameters Parameter Data Type Description ProxyRules Object Object The proxyRulesObject is a plain object that follows the format ProxyRules as defined by the Chrome Extension API to configures proxies. This object is \"flavoured\" to fit our runtime: users can define an additional property, authCredentials, for the Proxy server objects to provide authentication credentials for a specific proxy server. authCredentials is an object in the format {username: 'authUsername', password: 'authPassword'}. Examples Here's an example of creating a proxyRules with authCredentials: var proxyRules = { singleProxy: { host:\"example.com\", authCredentials: { username: 'authUsername', password: 'authPassword' } } }; Copy Here's an example of setting up a proxied network with mixed network zone assets: var proxyRules = {singleProxy: {host:\"http://entproxy.mycompany.com\"}, bypassList:['s3.amazonaws.com','*.localcdn.com'] } $network.setProxyAdvanced(proxyRules) Copy $network.clearProxy() Clears/removes the current proxy configuration. Returns This method returns a Promise that will resolve once the configuration has been applied. $network.getProxy() This method returns the current proxy configuration. It must be synchronized in a promise callback. Examples An example of synchronizing getProxy with $network.setProxy(); and $network.clearProxy();: var assert = require('assert'); $network.setProxy(\"http://user:password@myproxyurl.com\") .then(function () { console.log('Proxy configuration applied'); //Note: $network.getProxy() is not synchronized with the webdriver Control Flow. //To make sure we get the proxy configuration after the call to setProxy() above // succeeds we need to use a promise callback var proxyData = $network.getProxy(); console.log(proxyData); }) .then(function () { // Again: getProxy() is not synchronized with the Webdriver Control Flow: we //need this promise callback otherwise clearProxy() might be called before the call // to getProxy() above returns return $network.clearProxy(); }) .then(function () { console.log('Proxy configuration cleared'); // We need this promise callback for reasons explained above var proxyData = $network.getProxy(); assert.equal(proxyData.rules, null); }); Copy Proxy properties Important This proxy information applies only to these versions: API monitors: 0.4.0, 0.2.2, 0.2.1, 0.1.0 Scripted monitors: 0.1.0 In order to analyze and collect your HTTP traffic metrics, New Relic must ensure the traffic passes through a conceptual funnel. Our synthetic monitoring includes a software funnel component capable of analyzing the HTTP requests or responses and then recording the information. New Relic's scripted browser monitors (versions 0.4.x and lower) include a mechanism to do this analysis without needing an HTTP proxy, so you don't have to configure anything. New Relic's API test (versions 0.4.x and lower) provides an $http object that is pre-configured to make the requests pass through the internal HTTP proxy. This allows you to write your test without including any proxy settings. If you want to use some other way to generate HTTP traffic while still collecting the HTTP traffic metrics, you can use $env.PROXY_HOST and $env.PROXY_PORT. To record traffic metrics, be sure to include these properties in your script.

      "body": "Synthetic monitors are API checks or virtual browser instances that monitor your website, recording each check in detail. They can also capture aggregate numbers, including an overview, or summary for ping monitors, detailed statistics for each page resource, and downtime incidents. Synthetic monitoring also collects custom response codes for more detail on your monitor runs. For a description of synthetic monitor types, see Types of monitor. Add a monitor There are several types of synthetic monitor to add. Ping monitors ensure your website is responding, while simple browser monitors send real browsers to check your website. For more complex monitoring, scripted browser monitors verify that specific resources are present, while API tests verify your API endpoint. Add a ping or simple browser monitor Go to one.newrelic.com > Synthetics > Create monitor. Specify a monitor type, name, and URL. Optional: Add a validation string or Advanced options: A validation string is available for ping and simple browser. This option enables substring monitoring for response validation. Verify SSL is available for ping and simple browser. This option verifies the validity of the SSL certificate chain. It can be duplicated by running the following syntax: openssl s_client -servername {YOUR_HOSTNAME} -connect {YOUR_HOSTNAME}:443 -CApath /etc/ssl/certs -verify_hostname {YOUR_HOSTNAME} > /dev/null Copy If a non-zero exit code is returned, the monitor will fail. The Bypass HEAD request option is available for ping. This option skips the default HEAD request and instead uses the GET verb with a ping check. Redirect is Failure is available for ping. If a redirect result occurs when Redirect is Failure is enabled, New Relic Synthetics will categorize the result as a failure, rather than following the redirect and checking the resulting URL. Select the locations from which you want your monitor to run. Choose a frequency to determine how often each location will run your monitor. Optional: Set up alert notifications. Select Create my monitor to confirm. Wait a few minutes, then check your monitor from the Monitors index.

Tip You can also use the Synthetics REST API to add monitors. For example, you can create a GET request to the monitor you want to use as the source for configuration, then use those key values to use in a POST to \"copy\" and create a new monitor. Edit a monitor To edit an existing monitor: From the Monitors tab in one.newrelic.com > Synthetics, select the monitor you want to edit. In the side menu, select a link to change the following settings: Select Settings > General to edit name, Apdex T, URL, locations, frequency, and advanced options. For Scripted browser and API test monitors, select Settings > Script to edit your monitor script. For synthetic monitoring alerts, click Manage alerts. Select Save changes to confirm. Important You cannot change a monitor's type after the monitor is created. Delete a monitor To delete a monitor: From the Monitors tab in one.newrelic.com > Synthetics, select the monitor you want to edit. From the selected monitor, select Settings > General. Scroll to the bottom of the page and select the trash can icon. Tip You can also use the Synthetics REST API to delete a monitor. Monitor settings When configuring monitors, the following settings are available: Type Select the type of monitor you want to create. A monitor's type can't be changed after the monitor is created. Ping: Specify a single URL to monitor for availability. New Relic will check this URL via HEAD or GET requests. The non-configurable timeout for this monitor is 60 seconds. Simple browser: Specify a single URL to monitor via real browser. Once each frequency interval, New Relic will check this URL via a Selenium-powered Google Chrome browser. The non-configurable timeout for this monitor is 60 seconds. Scripted browser: Create a script to drive a Selenium-powered Google Chrome browser. The browser follows each step in the script to verify that complex behavior is working as expected (for example, searching a website, then clicking one of the search results). The non-configurable timeout for this monitor is 180 seconds. API test: Create an API script to ensure your API endpoint is working correctly. For more information, see Write API tests. The non-configurable timeout for this monitor is 180 seconds. Monitor name Defines a name for the monitor. Monitor names cannot contain unencoded angle brackets (< >). To include angle brackets in a monitor name, encode them as HTML bracket entities (&lt; &gt;) in the UI or API. Location Select the locations where you want your monitor to run. Select more locations to ensure that your application is available to users around the world. If you have any private locations, they will be listed here too. You can use the Synthetics API location endpoint to retrieve a list of valid locations for your account. Your monitor will run one check from each selected location during each frequency interval. For example, if you select three locations and define a frequency of 15 minutes, your monitor will run three checks in each 15 minute period (or 8,640 checks per month). Frequency Select how often the monitor runs, in increments of minutes, hours, or 1 day. This frequency applies to each location. For example, if you select three locations and a Frequency of 15 minutes, your monitor will run three checks, on average every 5 minutes, in each 15 minute period (or 8,640 checks per month). Alerts Specify an email address to receive alerts when a monitor fails. Or, attach a monitor to an existing alert policy for more notification options. For more information, see Alerting for synthetic monitoring. Apdex T Customize the Apdex T for this monitor. This setting is only available when editing the settings for an existing monitor, not when creating a new monitor. Change the Apdex T from the default 7 seconds for more accurate Apdex scores in your SLA reports. For example, if you have a very long scripted browser, you might adjust the Apdex T to 15 seconds to more closely reflect the usual completion time. Similarly, a good Apdex T for a simple browser check might be only 2 seconds. Response Validation (optional) Specify text to search for on the page. When using simple browser or ping monitor types, there is a 1MB (10^6 bytes) limit on the page load.

Understand SLA report metrics Use SLA reports to view aggregated performance metrics for a single monitor, or for all your monitors from the account-wide SLA Reports page. SLA reports include the following metrics: Duration: The average duration across all monitor results. Uptime: The percentage of all monitor results that ended successfully. For example, Monitor A might check 50 times per day, and Monitor B might check 150 times per day. If Monitor A has 29 successes out of 50 and Monitor B has 148 successes out of 150, the Uptime would be 88.5: (29+148)/(50+150)=88.5 For individual SLA reports, the uptime score only includes the selected monitor. Apdex: The average Apdex across all monitors. Monitors have a default Apdex T of 7 seconds, but you can customize Apdex T for individual monitors by editing their settings. Apdex F, which defines a frustrating result, is always four times Apdex T. For more information about Apdex, see Apdex: Measuring user satisfaction. For individual SLA reports, the Apdex score only includes the selected monitor. % Satisfied: The percentage of monitor results which complete in a \"satisfying\" time. A satisfying time is defined as a monitor result that completes in Apdex T or less. % Toleration: The percentage of monitor results which complete in a \"tolerable\" time. A tolerable time is greater than Apdex T, but less than Apdex F (four times Apdex T). % Frustrated: The percentage of monitor results which complete in a \"frustrating\" time. A frustrating time is greater than Apdex F (four times Apdex T). The account-wide SLA report includes all monitor types (ping, simple browser, scripted browser, and API test).

      "body": "Read on to learn about synthetic monitoring's proxy settings and properties. Proxy settings API for scripted monitors Important You can set proxy server configuration for synthetic scripted monitors for monitor versions 0.4.0 or higher. The global object $network allows you to control the network configuration used by your synthetic scripted monitors. The following are applicable for both scripted browsers and API tests, unless otherwise stated. $network.setProxy(string or object PROXY URL) Sets a proxy server to be used for all per-URL requests (HTTP, HTTPS, and FTP). Additional notes: The port is optional. If not provided, it will be derived from the scheme. For example, for HTTP the port would be 80. The username and password are assumed to be the result of a call to encodeURIComponent(). Special characters like @ and : in the username and/or the password must be escaped. Returns This method returns a Promise that will resolve once the configuration has been applied. Parameters Parameter Data Type Description proxyURL | proxyUrlParsed String or Object The URL to connect to the proxy server. A string containing a proxyURL (for example, http://proxy_host:8888) or a plain object in the same format as defined by Node's url.parse(urlString) method. Examples An example of setting a proxy server with HTTP protocol on port 1234 with no authentication: $network.setProxy('http://host.com:1234') Copy An example of setting a proxy server with HTTP protocol with authentication credentials. $network.setProxy('http://proxyUsername:proxyPassword@proxyHost:1234') Copy $network.setProxyForHttp(string or object PROXY URL) Tip This call is exactly the same as the per-URL setProxy call, except that it applies to HTTP traffic. Sets a proxy server to be used for all HTTP requests. Additional notes: The port is optional. If not provided, it will be derived from the scheme. For example, for HTTP the port would be 80. The username and password are assumed to be the result of a call to encodeURIComponent(). Special characters like @ and : in the username and/or the password must be escaped. Returns This method returns a Promise that will resolve once the configuration has been applied. Parameters Parameter Data Type Description proxyURL | proxyUrlParsed String or Object The URL to connect to the proxy server. A string containing a proxyURL (for example, http://proxy_host:8888) or a plain object in the same format as defined by Node's url.parse(urlString) method. Examples An example of setting a proxy server with HTTP protocol on port 1234 with no authentication: $network.setProxyForHttp('http://host.com:1234') Copy An example of setting a proxy server with HTTP protocol with authentication credentials. $network.setProxyForHttp('http://proxyUsername:proxyPassword@proxyHost:1234') Copy $network.setProxyForHttps(string or object PROXY URL) Tip This call is exactly the same as the per-URL setProxy call, except that it applies to HTTPS traffic. Sets a proxy server to be used for all HTTPS requests. Additional notes: The port is optional. If not provided, it will be derived from the scheme. For example, for HTTP the default port would be 443. The username and password are assumed to be the result of a call to encodeURIComponent(). Special characters like @ and : in the username and/or the password must be escaped. Returns This method returns a Promise that will resolve once the configuration has been applied. Parameters Parameter Data Type Description proxyURL | proxyUrlParsed String or Object The URL to connect to the proxy server. A string containing a proxyURL (for example, http://proxy_host:8888) or a plain object in the same format as defined by Node's url.parse(urlString) method. Examples An example of setting a proxy server with HTTPS protocol on port 1234 with no authentication: $network.setProxyForHttps('https://host.com:1234') Copy An example of setting a proxy server with HTTPS protocol with authentication credentials. $network.setProxyForHttps('https://proxyUsername:proxyPassword@proxyHost:1234') Copy $network.setProxyPAC(string PAC SCRIPT URL, object AUTH OBJECT) Sets a proxy server via a proxy auto-config (PAC) script and returns a promise. This function is only available for scripted browser monitors. Returns This method returns a Promise that will resolve once the configuration has been applied. Parameters Parameter Data Type Description scriptURL String The URL of the PAC script. authCredentialsMap Object Map of authentication credentials to be provided to the proxy server(s), keyed by the hostnames of the proxy server. Values of this map must be defined in the format {username: 'authUsername', password: 'authPassword'} Examples An example of setting a proxy server via a proxy auto-config (PAC) script: var authCredentialsMap = { 'example.com': {username: 'authUsername', password: 'authPassword'}, } Copy $network.setProxyAdvanced(object PROXY RULES OBJECT) Tip This method is Chrome-specific: it only applies to scripted browser monitor types. It can be used to allow for a more flexible and complex proxy configuration. In most cases, this method will not be needed. Sets the proxy configuration using the format supported by Chrome Extension API for Proxying. The input is a ProxyRules object, as defined by the Chrome Extension API to configures proxies. You can add authCredentials for proxies that need it. See Parameters for more details. Returns This method returns a Promise that will resolve once the configuration has been applied. Parameters Parameter Data Type Description ProxyRules Object Object The proxyRulesObject is a plain object that follows the format ProxyRules as defined by the Chrome Extension API to configures proxies. This object is \"flavoured\" to fit our runtime: users can define an additional property, authCredentials, for the Proxy server objects to provide authentication credentials for a specific proxy server. authCredentials is an object in the format {username: 'authUsername', password: 'authPassword'}. Examples Here's an example of creating a proxyRules with authCredentials: var proxyRules = { singleProxy: { host:\"example.com\", authCredentials: { username: 'authUsername', password: 'authPassword' } } }; Copy Here's an example of setting up a proxied network with mixed network zone assets: var proxyRules = {singleProxy: {host:\"http://entproxy.mycompany.com\"}, bypassList:['s3.amazonaws.com','*.localcdn.com'] } $network.setProxyAdvanced(proxyRules) Copy $network.clearProxy() Clears/removes the current proxy configuration. Returns This method returns a Promise that will resolve once the configuration has been applied. $network.getProxy() This method returns the current proxy configuration. It must be synchronized in a promise callback. Examples An example of synchronizing getProxy with $network.setProxy(); and $network.clearProxy();: var assert = require('assert'); $network.setProxy(\"http://user:password@myproxyurl.com\") .then(function () { console.log('Proxy configuration applied'); //Note: $network.getProxy() is not synchronized with the webdriver Control Flow. //To make sure we get the proxy configuration after the call to setProxy() above // succeeds we need to use a promise callback var proxyData = $network.getProxy(); console.log(proxyData); }) .then(function () { // Again: getProxy() is not synchronized with the Webdriver Control Flow: we //need this promise callback otherwise clearProxy() might be called before the call // to getProxy() above returns return $network.clearProxy(); }) .then(function () { console.log('Proxy configuration cleared'); // We need this promise callback for reasons explained above var proxyData = $network.getProxy(); assert.equal(proxyData.rules, null); }); Copy Proxy properties Important This proxy information applies only to these versions: API monitors: 0.4.0, 0.2.2, 0.2.1, 0.1.0 Scripted monitors: 0.1.0 In order to analyze and collect your HTTP traffic metrics, New Relic must ensure the traffic passes through a conceptual funnel. Our synthetic monitoring includes a software funnel component capable of analyzing the HTTP requests or responses and then recording the information. New Relic's scripted browser monitors (versions 0.4.x and lower) include a mechanism to do this analysis without needing an HTTP proxy, so you don't have to configure anything. New Relic's API test (versions 0.4.x and lower) provides an $http object that is pre-configured to make the requests pass through the internal HTTP proxy. This allows you to write your test without including any proxy settings. If you want to use some other way to generate HTTP traffic while still collecting the HTTP traffic metrics, you can use $env.PROXY_HOST and $env.PROXY_PORT. To record traffic metrics, be sure to include these properties in your script.

      "body": "Synthetic monitors are API checks or virtual browser instances that monitor your website, recording each check in detail. They can also capture aggregate numbers, including an overview, or summary for ping monitors, detailed statistics for each page resource, and downtime incidents. Synthetic monitoring also collects custom response codes for more detail on your monitor runs. For a description of synthetic monitor types, see Types of monitor. Add a monitor There are several types of synthetic monitor to add. Ping monitors ensure your website is responding, while simple browser monitors send real browsers to check your website. For more complex monitoring, scripted browser monitors verify that specific resources are present, while API tests verify your API endpoint. Add a ping or simple browser monitor Go to one.newrelic.com > Synthetics > Create monitor. Specify a monitor type, name, and URL. Optional: Add a validation string or Advanced options: A validation string is available for ping and simple browser. This option enables substring monitoring for response validation. Verify SSL is available for ping and simple browser. This option verifies the validity of the SSL certificate chain. It can be duplicated by running the following syntax: openssl s_client -servername {YOUR_HOSTNAME} -connect {YOUR_HOSTNAME}:443 -CApath /etc/ssl/certs -verify_hostname {YOUR_HOSTNAME} > /dev/null Copy If a non-zero exit code is returned, the monitor will fail. The Bypass HEAD request option is available for ping. This option skips the default HEAD request and instead uses the GET verb with a ping check. Redirect is Failure is available for ping. If a redirect result occurs when Redirect is Failure is enabled, New Relic Synthetics will categorize the result as a failure, rather than following the redirect and checking the resulting URL. Select the locations from which you want your monitor to run. Choose a frequency to determine how often each location will run your monitor. Optional: Set up alert notifications. Select Create my monitor to confirm. Wait a few minutes, then check your monitor from the Monitors index.

Delete a monitor To delete a monitor: From the Monitors tab in one.newrelic.com > Synthetics, select the monitor you want to edit. From the selected monitor, select Settings > General. Scroll to the bottom of the page and select the trash can icon. Tip You can also use the Synthetics REST API to delete a monitor. Monitor settings When configuring monitors, the following settings are available: Type Select the type of monitor you want to create. A monitor's type can't be changed after the monitor is created. Ping: Specify a single URL to monitor for availability. New Relic will check this URL via HEAD or GET requests. The non-configurable timeout for this monitor is 60 seconds. Simple browser: Specify a single URL to monitor via real browser. Once each frequency interval, New Relic will check this URL via a Selenium-powered Google Chrome browser. The non-configurable timeout for this monitor is 60 seconds. Scripted browser: Create a script to drive a Selenium-powered Google Chrome browser. The browser follows each step in the script to verify that complex behavior is working as expected (for example, searching a website, then clicking one of the search results). The non-configurable timeout for this monitor is 180 seconds. API test: Create an API script to ensure your API endpoint is working correctly. For more information, see Write API tests. The non-configurable timeout for this monitor is 180 seconds. Monitor name Defines a name for the monitor. Monitor names cannot contain unencoded angle brackets (< >). To include angle brackets in a monitor name, encode them as HTML bracket entities (&lt; &gt;) in the UI or API. Location Select the locations where you want your monitor to run. Select more locations to ensure that your application is available to users around the world. If you have any private locations, they will be listed here too. You can use the Synthetics API location endpoint to retrieve a list of valid locations for your account. Your monitor will run one check from each selected location during each frequency interval. For example, if you select three locations and define a frequency of 15 minutes, your monitor will run three checks in each 15 minute period (or 8,640 checks per month). Frequency Select how often the monitor runs, in increments of minutes, hours, or 1 day. This frequency applies to each location. For example, if you select three locations and a Frequency of 15 minutes, your monitor will run three checks, on average every 5 minutes, in each 15 minute period (or 8,640 checks per month). Alerts Specify an email address to receive alerts when a monitor fails. Or, attach a monitor to an existing alert policy for more notification options. For more information, see Alerting for synthetic monitoring. Apdex T Customize the Apdex T for this monitor. This setting is only available when editing the settings for an existing monitor, not when creating a new monitor. Change the Apdex T from the default 7 seconds for more accurate Apdex scores in your SLA reports. For example, if you have a very long scripted browser, you might adjust the Apdex T to 15 seconds to more closely reflect the usual completion time. Similarly, a good Apdex T for a simple browser check might be only 2 seconds. Response Validation (optional) Specify text to search for on the page. When using simple browser or ping monitor types, there is a 1MB (10^6 bytes) limit on the page load.

You can also view SLA reports for individual monitors: Go to one.newrelic.com > Synthetics > (select a monitor) > SLA. one.newrelic.com > Synthetics > SLA Report: Use SLA reports to understand your monitors' performance over time. Understand SLA report metrics Use SLA reports to view aggregated performance metrics for a single monitor, or for all your monitors from the account-wide SLA Reports page. SLA reports include the following metrics: Duration: The average duration across all monitor results. Uptime: The percentage of all monitor results that ended successfully. For example, Monitor A might check 50 times per day, and Monitor B might check 150 times per day. If Monitor A has 29 successes out of 50 and Monitor B has 148 successes out of 150, the Uptime would be 88.5: (29+148)/(50+150)=88.5 For individual SLA reports, the uptime score only includes the selected monitor. Apdex: The average Apdex across all monitors. Monitors have a default Apdex T of 7 seconds, but you can customize Apdex T for individual monitors by editing their settings. Apdex F, which defines a frustrating result, is always four times Apdex T. For more information about Apdex, see Apdex: Measuring user satisfaction. For individual SLA reports, the Apdex score only includes the selected monitor. % Satisfied: The percentage of monitor results which complete in a \"satisfying\" time. A satisfying time is defined as a monitor result that completes in Apdex T or less. % Toleration: The percentage of monitor results which complete in a \"tolerable\" time. A tolerable time is greater than Apdex T, but less than Apdex F (four times Apdex T). % Frustrated: The percentage of monitor results which complete in a \"frustrating\" time. A frustrating time is greater than Apdex F (four times Apdex T). The account-wide SLA report includes all monitor types (ping, simple browser, scripted browser, and API test).

      "body": "Read on to learn about synthetic monitoring's proxy settings and properties. Proxy settings API for scripted monitors Important You can set proxy server configuration for synthetic scripted monitors for monitor versions 0.4.0 or higher. The global object $network allows you to control the network configuration used by your synthetic scripted monitors. The following are applicable for both scripted browsers and API tests, unless otherwise stated. $network.setProxy(string or object PROXY URL) Sets a proxy server to be used for all per-URL requests (HTTP, HTTPS, and FTP). Additional notes: The port is optional. If not provided, it will be derived from the scheme. For example, for HTTP the port would be 80. The username and password are assumed to be the result of a call to encodeURIComponent(). Special characters like @ and : in the username and/or the password must be escaped. Returns This method returns a Promise that will resolve once the configuration has been applied. Parameters Parameter Data Type Description proxyURL | proxyUrlParsed String or Object The URL to connect to the proxy server. A string containing a proxyURL (for example, http://proxy_host:8888) or a plain object in the same format as defined by Node's url.parse(urlString) method. Examples An example of setting a proxy server with HTTP protocol on port 1234 with no authentication: $network.setProxy('http://host.com:1234') Copy An example of setting a proxy server with HTTP protocol with authentication credentials. $network.setProxy('http://proxyUsername:proxyPassword@proxyHost:1234') Copy $network.setProxyForHttp(string or object PROXY URL) Tip This call is exactly the same as the per-URL setProxy call, except that it applies to HTTP traffic. Sets a proxy server to be used for all HTTP requests. Additional notes: The port is optional. If not provided, it will be derived from the scheme. For example, for HTTP the port would be 80. The username and password are assumed to be the result of a call to encodeURIComponent(). Special characters like @ and : in the username and/or the password must be escaped. Returns This method returns a Promise that will resolve once the configuration has been applied. Parameters Parameter Data Type Description proxyURL | proxyUrlParsed String or Object The URL to connect to the proxy server. A string containing a proxyURL (for example, http://proxy_host:8888) or a plain object in the same format as defined by Node's url.parse(urlString) method. Examples An example of setting a proxy server with HTTP protocol on port 1234 with no authentication: $network.setProxyForHttp('http://host.com:1234') Copy An example of setting a proxy server with HTTP protocol with authentication credentials. $network.setProxyForHttp('http://proxyUsername:proxyPassword@proxyHost:1234') Copy $network.setProxyForHttps(string or object PROXY URL) Tip This call is exactly the same as the per-URL setProxy call, except that it applies to HTTPS traffic. Sets a proxy server to be used for all HTTPS requests. Additional notes: The port is optional. If not provided, it will be derived from the scheme. For example, for HTTP the default port would be 443. The username and password are assumed to be the result of a call to encodeURIComponent(). Special characters like @ and : in the username and/or the password must be escaped. Returns This method returns a Promise that will resolve once the configuration has been applied. Parameters Parameter Data Type Description proxyURL | proxyUrlParsed String or Object The URL to connect to the proxy server. A string containing a proxyURL (for example, http://proxy_host:8888) or a plain object in the same format as defined by Node's url.parse(urlString) method. Examples An example of setting a proxy server with HTTPS protocol on port 1234 with no authentication: $network.setProxyForHttps('https://host.com:1234') Copy An example of setting a proxy server with HTTPS protocol with authentication credentials. $network.setProxyForHttps('https://proxyUsername:proxyPassword@proxyHost:1234') Copy $network.setProxyPAC(string PAC SCRIPT URL, object AUTH OBJECT) Sets a proxy server via a proxy auto-config (PAC) script and returns a promise. This function is only available for scripted browser monitors. Returns This method returns a Promise that will resolve once the configuration has been applied. Parameters Parameter Data Type Description scriptURL String The URL of the PAC script. authCredentialsMap Object Map of authentication credentials to be provided to the proxy server(s), keyed by the hostnames of the proxy server. Values of this map must be defined in the format {username: 'authUsername', password: 'authPassword'} Examples An example of setting a proxy server via a proxy auto-config (PAC) script: var authCredentialsMap = { 'example.com': {username: 'authUsername', password: 'authPassword'}, } Copy $network.setProxyAdvanced(object PROXY RULES OBJECT) Tip This method is Chrome-specific: it only applies to scripted browser monitor types. It can be used to allow for a more flexible and complex proxy configuration. In most cases, this method will not be needed. Sets the proxy configuration using the format supported by Chrome Extension API for Proxying. The input is a ProxyRules object, as defined by the Chrome Extension API to configures proxies. You can add authCredentials for proxies that need it. See Parameters for more details. Returns This method returns a Promise that will resolve once the configuration has been applied. Parameters Parameter Data Type Description ProxyRules Object Object The proxyRulesObject is a plain object that follows the format ProxyRules as defined by the Chrome Extension API to configures proxies. This object is \"flavoured\" to fit our runtime: users can define an additional property, authCredentials, for the Proxy server objects to provide authentication credentials for a specific proxy server. authCredentials is an object in the format {username: 'authUsername', password: 'authPassword'}. Examples Here's an example of creating a proxyRules with authCredentials: var proxyRules = { singleProxy: { host:\"example.com\", authCredentials: { username: 'authUsername', password: 'authPassword' } } }; Copy Here's an example of setting up a proxied network with mixed network zone assets: var proxyRules = {singleProxy: {host:\"http://entproxy.mycompany.com\"}, bypassList:['s3.amazonaws.com','*.localcdn.com'] } $network.setProxyAdvanced(proxyRules) Copy $network.clearProxy() Clears/removes the current proxy configuration. Returns This method returns a Promise that will resolve once the configuration has been applied. $network.getProxy() This method returns the current proxy configuration. It must be synchronized in a promise callback. Examples An example of synchronizing getProxy with $network.setProxy(); and $network.clearProxy();: var assert = require('assert'); $network.setProxy(\"http://user:password@myproxyurl.com\") .then(function () { console.log('Proxy configuration applied'); //Note: $network.getProxy() is not synchronized with the webdriver Control Flow. //To make sure we get the proxy configuration after the call to setProxy() above // succeeds we need to use a promise callback var proxyData = $network.getProxy(); console.log(proxyData); }) .then(function () { // Again: getProxy() is not synchronized with the Webdriver Control Flow: we //need this promise callback otherwise clearProxy() might be called before the call // to getProxy() above returns return $network.clearProxy(); }) .then(function () { console.log('Proxy configuration cleared'); // We need this promise callback for reasons explained above var proxyData = $network.getProxy(); assert.equal(proxyData.rules, null); }); Copy Proxy properties Important This proxy information applies only to these versions: API monitors: 0.4.0, 0.2.2, 0.2.1, 0.1.0 Scripted monitors: 0.1.0 In order to analyze and collect your HTTP traffic metrics, New Relic must ensure the traffic passes through a conceptual funnel. Our synthetic monitoring includes a software funnel component capable of analyzing the HTTP requests or responses and then recording the information. New Relic's scripted browser monitors (versions 0.4.x and lower) include a mechanism to do this analysis without needing an HTTP proxy, so you don't have to configure anything. New Relic's API test (versions 0.4.x and lower) provides an $http object that is pre-configured to make the requests pass through the internal HTTP proxy. This allows you to write your test without including any proxy settings. If you want to use some other way to generate HTTP traffic while still collecting the HTTP traffic metrics, you can use $env.PROXY_HOST and $env.PROXY_PORT. To record traffic metrics, be sure to include these properties in your script.

      "body": "Synthetic monitors are API checks or virtual browser instances that monitor your website, recording each check in detail. They can also capture aggregate numbers, including an overview, or summary for ping monitors, detailed statistics for each page resource, and downtime incidents. Synthetic monitoring also collects custom response codes for more detail on your monitor runs. For a description of synthetic monitor types, see Types of monitor. Add a monitor There are several types of synthetic monitor to add. Ping monitors ensure your website is responding, while simple browser monitors send real browsers to check your website. For more complex monitoring, scripted browser monitors verify that specific resources are present, while API tests verify your API endpoint. Add a ping or simple browser monitor Go to one.newrelic.com > Synthetics > Create monitor. Specify a monitor type, name, and URL. Optional: Add a validation string or Advanced options: A validation string is available for ping and simple browser. This option enables substring monitoring for response validation. Verify SSL is available for ping and simple browser. This option verifies the validity of the SSL certificate chain. It can be duplicated by running the following syntax: openssl s_client -servername {YOUR_HOSTNAME} -connect {YOUR_HOSTNAME}:443 -CApath /etc/ssl/certs -verify_hostname {YOUR_HOSTNAME} > /dev/null Copy If a non-zero exit code is returned, the monitor will fail. The Bypass HEAD request option is available for ping. This option skips the default HEAD request and instead uses the GET verb with a ping check. Redirect is Failure is available for ping. If a redirect result occurs when Redirect is Failure is enabled, New Relic Synthetics will categorize the result as a failure, rather than following the redirect and checking the resulting URL. Select the locations from which you want your monitor to run. Choose a frequency to determine how often each location will run your monitor. Optional: Set up alert notifications. Select Create my monitor to confirm. Wait a few minutes, then check your monitor from the Monitors index.

Monitor settings When configuring monitors, the following settings are available: Type Select the type of monitor you want to create. A monitor's type can't be changed after the monitor is created. Ping: Specify a single URL to monitor for availability. New Relic will check this URL via HEAD or GET requests. The non-configurable timeout for this monitor is 60 seconds. Simple browser: Specify a single URL to monitor via real browser. Once each frequency interval, New Relic will check this URL via a Selenium-powered Google Chrome browser. The non-configurable timeout for this monitor is 60 seconds. Scripted browser: Create a script to drive a Selenium-powered Google Chrome browser. The browser follows each step in the script to verify that complex behavior is working as expected (for example, searching a website, then clicking one of the search results). The non-configurable timeout for this monitor is 180 seconds. API test: Create an API script to ensure your API endpoint is working correctly. For more information, see Write API tests. The non-configurable timeout for this monitor is 180 seconds. Monitor name Defines a name for the monitor. Monitor names cannot contain unencoded angle brackets (< >). To include angle brackets in a monitor name, encode them as HTML bracket entities (&lt; &gt;) in the UI or API. Location Select the locations where you want your monitor to run. Select more locations to ensure that your application is available to users around the world. If you have any private locations, they will be listed here too. You can use the Synthetics API location endpoint to retrieve a list of valid locations for your account. Your monitor will run one check from each selected location during each frequency interval. For example, if you select three locations and define a frequency of 15 minutes, your monitor will run three checks in each 15 minute period (or 8,640 checks per month). Frequency Select how often the monitor runs, in increments of minutes, hours, or 1 day. This frequency applies to each location. For example, if you select three locations and a Frequency of 15 minutes, your monitor will run three checks, on average every 5 minutes, in each 15 minute period (or 8,640 checks per month). Alerts Specify an email address to receive alerts when a monitor fails. Or, attach a monitor to an existing alert policy for more notification options. For more information, see Alerting for synthetic monitoring. Apdex T Customize the Apdex T for this monitor. This setting is only available when editing the settings for an existing monitor, not when creating a new monitor. Change the Apdex T from the default 7 seconds for more accurate Apdex scores in your SLA reports. For example, if you have a very long scripted browser, you might adjust the Apdex T to 15 seconds to more closely reflect the usual completion time. Similarly, a good Apdex T for a simple browser check might be only 2 seconds. Response Validation (optional) Specify text to search for on the page. When using simple browser or ping monitor types, there is a 1MB (10^6 bytes) limit on the page load.

Understand SLA report metrics Use SLA reports to view aggregated performance metrics for a single monitor, or for all your monitors from the account-wide SLA Reports page. SLA reports include the following metrics: Duration: The average duration across all monitor results. Uptime: The percentage of all monitor results that ended successfully. For example, Monitor A might check 50 times per day, and Monitor B might check 150 times per day. If Monitor A has 29 successes out of 50 and Monitor B has 148 successes out of 150, the Uptime would be 88.5: (29+148)/(50+150)=88.5 For individual SLA reports, the uptime score only includes the selected monitor. Apdex: The average Apdex across all monitors. Monitors have a default Apdex T of 7 seconds, but you can customize Apdex T for individual monitors by editing their settings. Apdex F, which defines a frustrating result, is always four times Apdex T. For more information about Apdex, see Apdex: Measuring user satisfaction. For individual SLA reports, the Apdex score only includes the selected monitor. % Satisfied: The percentage of monitor results which complete in a \"satisfying\" time. A satisfying time is defined as a monitor result that completes in Apdex T or less. % Toleration: The percentage of monitor results which complete in a \"tolerable\" time. A tolerable time is greater than Apdex T, but less than Apdex F (four times Apdex T). % Frustrated: The percentage of monitor results which complete in a \"frustrating\" time. A frustrating time is greater than Apdex F (four times Apdex T). The account-wide SLA report includes all monitor types (ping, simple browser, scripted browser, and API test).

      "body": "Read on to learn about synthetic monitoring's proxy settings and properties. Proxy settings API for scripted monitors Important You can set proxy server configuration for synthetic scripted monitors for monitor versions 0.4.0 or higher. The global object $network allows you to control the network configuration used by your synthetic scripted monitors. The following are applicable for both scripted browsers and API tests, unless otherwise stated. $network.setProxy(string or object PROXY URL) Sets a proxy server to be used for all per-URL requests (HTTP, HTTPS, and FTP). Additional notes: The port is optional. If not provided, it will be derived from the scheme. For example, for HTTP the port would be 80. The username and password are assumed to be the result of a call to encodeURIComponent(). Special characters like @ and : in the username and/or the password must be escaped. Returns This method returns a Promise that will resolve once the configuration has been applied. Parameters Parameter Data Type Description proxyURL | proxyUrlParsed String or Object The URL to connect to the proxy server. A string containing a proxyURL (for example, http://proxy_host:8888) or a plain object in the same format as defined by Node's url.parse(urlString) method. Examples An example of setting a proxy server with HTTP protocol on port 1234 with no authentication: $network.setProxy('http://host.com:1234') Copy An example of setting a proxy server with HTTP protocol with authentication credentials. $network.setProxy('http://proxyUsername:proxyPassword@proxyHost:1234') Copy $network.setProxyForHttp(string or object PROXY URL) Tip This call is exactly the same as the per-URL setProxy call, except that it applies to HTTP traffic. Sets a proxy server to be used for all HTTP requests. Additional notes: The port is optional. If not provided, it will be derived from the scheme. For example, for HTTP the port would be 80. The username and password are assumed to be the result of a call to encodeURIComponent(). Special characters like @ and : in the username and/or the password must be escaped. Returns This method returns a Promise that will resolve once the configuration has been applied. Parameters Parameter Data Type Description proxyURL | proxyUrlParsed String or Object The URL to connect to the proxy server. A string containing a proxyURL (for example, http://proxy_host:8888) or a plain object in the same format as defined by Node's url.parse(urlString) method. Examples An example of setting a proxy server with HTTP protocol on port 1234 with no authentication: $network.setProxyForHttp('http://host.com:1234') Copy An example of setting a proxy server with HTTP protocol with authentication credentials. $network.setProxyForHttp('http://proxyUsername:proxyPassword@proxyHost:1234') Copy $network.setProxyForHttps(string or object PROXY URL) Tip This call is exactly the same as the per-URL setProxy call, except that it applies to HTTPS traffic. Sets a proxy server to be used for all HTTPS requests. Additional notes: The port is optional. If not provided, it will be derived from the scheme. For example, for HTTP the default port would be 443. The username and password are assumed to be the result of a call to encodeURIComponent(). Special characters like @ and : in the username and/or the password must be escaped. Returns This method returns a Promise that will resolve once the configuration has been applied. Parameters Parameter Data Type Description proxyURL | proxyUrlParsed String or Object The URL to connect to the proxy server. A string containing a proxyURL (for example, http://proxy_host:8888) or a plain object in the same format as defined by Node's url.parse(urlString) method. Examples An example of setting a proxy server with HTTPS protocol on port 1234 with no authentication: $network.setProxyForHttps('https://host.com:1234') Copy An example of setting a proxy server with HTTPS protocol with authentication credentials. $network.setProxyForHttps('https://proxyUsername:proxyPassword@proxyHost:1234') Copy $network.setProxyPAC(string PAC SCRIPT URL, object AUTH OBJECT) Sets a proxy server via a proxy auto-config (PAC) script and returns a promise. This function is only available for scripted browser monitors. Returns This method returns a Promise that will resolve once the configuration has been applied. Parameters Parameter Data Type Description scriptURL String The URL of the PAC script. authCredentialsMap Object Map of authentication credentials to be provided to the proxy server(s), keyed by the hostnames of the proxy server. Values of this map must be defined in the format {username: 'authUsername', password: 'authPassword'} Examples An example of setting a proxy server via a proxy auto-config (PAC) script: var authCredentialsMap = { 'example.com': {username: 'authUsername', password: 'authPassword'}, } Copy $network.setProxyAdvanced(object PROXY RULES OBJECT) Tip This method is Chrome-specific: it only applies to scripted browser monitor types. It can be used to allow for a more flexible and complex proxy configuration. In most cases, this method will not be needed. Sets the proxy configuration using the format supported by Chrome Extension API for Proxying. The input is a ProxyRules object, as defined by the Chrome Extension API to configures proxies. You can add authCredentials for proxies that need it. See Parameters for more details. Returns This method returns a Promise that will resolve once the configuration has been applied. Parameters Parameter Data Type Description ProxyRules Object Object The proxyRulesObject is a plain object that follows the format ProxyRules as defined by the Chrome Extension API to configures proxies. This object is \"flavoured\" to fit our runtime: users can define an additional property, authCredentials, for the Proxy server objects to provide authentication credentials for a specific proxy server. authCredentials is an object in the format {username: 'authUsername', password: 'authPassword'}. Examples Here's an example of creating a proxyRules with authCredentials: var proxyRules = { singleProxy: { host:\"example.com\", authCredentials: { username: 'authUsername', password: 'authPassword' } } }; Copy Here's an example of setting up a proxied network with mixed network zone assets: var proxyRules = {singleProxy: {host:\"http://entproxy.mycompany.com\"}, bypassList:['s3.amazonaws.com','*.localcdn.com'] } $network.setProxyAdvanced(proxyRules) Copy $network.clearProxy() Clears/removes the current proxy configuration. Returns This method returns a Promise that will resolve once the configuration has been applied. $network.getProxy() This method returns the current proxy configuration. It must be synchronized in a promise callback. Examples An example of synchronizing getProxy with $network.setProxy(); and $network.clearProxy();: var assert = require('assert'); $network.setProxy(\"http://user:password@myproxyurl.com\") .then(function () { console.log('Proxy configuration applied'); //Note: $network.getProxy() is not synchronized with the webdriver Control Flow. //To make sure we get the proxy configuration after the call to setProxy() above // succeeds we need to use a promise callback var proxyData = $network.getProxy(); console.log(proxyData); }) .then(function () { // Again: getProxy() is not synchronized with the Webdriver Control Flow: we //need this promise callback otherwise clearProxy() might be called before the call // to getProxy() above returns return $network.clearProxy(); }) .then(function () { console.log('Proxy configuration cleared'); // We need this promise callback for reasons explained above var proxyData = $network.getProxy(); assert.equal(proxyData.rules, null); }); Copy Proxy properties Important This proxy information applies only to these versions: API monitors: 0.4.0, 0.2.2, 0.2.1, 0.1.0 Scripted monitors: 0.1.0 In order to analyze and collect your HTTP traffic metrics, New Relic must ensure the traffic passes through a conceptual funnel. Our synthetic monitoring includes a software funnel component capable of analyzing the HTTP requests or responses and then recording the information. New Relic's scripted browser monitors (versions 0.4.x and lower) include a mechanism to do this analysis without needing an HTTP proxy, so you don't have to configure anything. New Relic's API test (versions 0.4.x and lower) provides an $http object that is pre-configured to make the requests pass through the internal HTTP proxy. This allows you to write your test without including any proxy settings. If you want to use some other way to generate HTTP traffic while still collecting the HTTP traffic metrics, you can use $env.PROXY_HOST and $env.PROXY_PORT. To record traffic metrics, be sure to include these properties in your script.

      "body": "Synthetic monitors are API checks or virtual browser instances that monitor your website, recording each check in detail. They can also capture aggregate numbers, including an overview, or summary for ping monitors, detailed statistics for each page resource, and downtime incidents. Synthetic monitoring also collects custom response codes for more detail on your monitor runs. For a description of synthetic monitor types, see Types of monitor. Add a monitor There are several types of synthetic monitor to add. Ping monitors ensure your website is responding, while simple browser monitors send real browsers to check your website. For more complex monitoring, scripted browser monitors verify that specific resources are present, while API tests verify your API endpoint. Add a ping or simple browser monitor Go to one.newrelic.com > Synthetics > Create monitor. Specify a monitor type, name, and URL. Optional: Add a validation string or Advanced options: A validation string is available for ping and simple browser. This option enables substring monitoring for response validation. Verify SSL is available for ping and simple browser. This option verifies the validity of the SSL certificate chain. It can be duplicated by running the following syntax: openssl s_client -servername {YOUR_HOSTNAME} -connect {YOUR_HOSTNAME}:443 -CApath /etc/ssl/certs -verify_hostname {YOUR_HOSTNAME} > /dev/null Copy If a non-zero exit code is returned, the monitor will fail. The Bypass HEAD request option is available for ping. This option skips the default HEAD request and instead uses the GET verb with a ping check. Redirect is Failure is available for ping. If a redirect result occurs when Redirect is Failure is enabled, New Relic Synthetics will categorize the result as a failure, rather than following the redirect and checking the resulting URL. Select the locations from which you want your monitor to run. Choose a frequency to determine how often each location will run your monitor. Optional: Set up alert notifications. Select Create my monitor to confirm. Wait a few minutes, then check your monitor from the Monitors index. Add a scripted browser or API test monitor Go to one.newrelic.com > Synthetics > Create monitor. Specify a monitor type and name. Select the locations from which you want your monitor to run. Choose a frequency to determine how often each location will run your monitor. Optional: Set up alert notifications. Select Next: Write your script to create a script for your scripted browser or API test, then select Validate to verify your syntax. Tip For complex scripts, validation may take up to one minute. Select Create my monitor to confirm. Wait a few minutes, then check your monitor from the Monitors index. Add a step monitor Go to one.newrelic.com > Synthetics > Create monitor. Select step monitor as the monitor type. Specify a name and choose a frequency to determine how often each location will run your monitor. Select the locations from which you want your monitor to run. Build your monitor by selecting from the preconfigured steps at the bottom of the UI: Navigate to a URL Type text Click an element Assert text Assert an element Secure a credential Use the instructions on the right side of the UI to help locate elements by CSS class, HTML ID, link text, or XPath.

Delete a monitor To delete a monitor: From the Monitors tab in one.newrelic.com > Synthetics, select the monitor you want to edit. From the selected monitor, select Settings > General. Scroll to the bottom of the page and select the trash can icon. Tip You can also use the Synthetics REST API to delete a monitor. Monitor settings When configuring monitors, the following settings are available: Type Select the type of monitor you want to create. A monitor's type can't be changed after the monitor is created. Ping: Specify a single URL to monitor for availability. New Relic will check this URL via HEAD or GET requests. The non-configurable timeout for this monitor is 60 seconds. Simple browser: Specify a single URL to monitor via real browser. Once each frequency interval, New Relic will check this URL via a Selenium-powered Google Chrome browser. The non-configurable timeout for this monitor is 60 seconds. Scripted browser: Create a script to drive a Selenium-powered Google Chrome browser. The browser follows each step in the script to verify that complex behavior is working as expected (for example, searching a website, then clicking one of the search results). The non-configurable timeout for this monitor is 180 seconds. API test: Create an API script to ensure your API endpoint is working correctly. For more information, see Write API tests. The non-configurable timeout for this monitor is 180 seconds. Monitor name Defines a name for the monitor. Monitor names cannot contain unencoded angle brackets (< >). To include angle brackets in a monitor name, encode them as HTML bracket entities (&lt; &gt;) in the UI or API. Location Select the locations where you want your monitor to run. Select more locations to ensure that your application is available to users around the world. If you have any private locations, they will be listed here too. You can use the Synthetics API location endpoint to retrieve a list of valid locations for your account. Your monitor will run one check from each selected location during each frequency interval. For example, if you select three locations and define a frequency of 15 minutes, your monitor will run three checks in each 15 minute period (or 8,640 checks per month). Frequency Select how often the monitor runs, in increments of minutes, hours, or 1 day. This frequency applies to each location. For example, if you select three locations and a Frequency of 15 minutes, your monitor will run three checks, on average every 5 minutes, in each 15 minute period (or 8,640 checks per month). Alerts Specify an email address to receive alerts when a monitor fails. Or, attach a monitor to an existing alert policy for more notification options. For more information, see Alerting for synthetic monitoring. Apdex T Customize the Apdex T for this monitor. This setting is only available when editing the settings for an existing monitor, not when creating a new monitor. Change the Apdex T from the default 7 seconds for more accurate Apdex scores in your SLA reports. For example, if you have a very long scripted browser, you might adjust the Apdex T to 15 seconds to more closely reflect the usual completion time. Similarly, a good Apdex T for a simple browser check might be only 2 seconds. Response Validation (optional) Specify text to search for on the page. When using simple browser or ping monitor types, there is a 1MB (10^6 bytes) limit on the page load.

You can also view SLA reports for individual monitors: Go to one.newrelic.com > Synthetics > (select a monitor) > SLA. one.newrelic.com > Synthetics > SLA Report: Use SLA reports to understand your monitors' performance over time. Understand SLA report metrics Use SLA reports to view aggregated performance metrics for a single monitor, or for all your monitors from the account-wide SLA Reports page. SLA reports include the following metrics: Duration: The average duration across all monitor results. Uptime: The percentage of all monitor results that ended successfully. For example, Monitor A might check 50 times per day, and Monitor B might check 150 times per day. If Monitor A has 29 successes out of 50 and Monitor B has 148 successes out of 150, the Uptime would be 88.5: (29+148)/(50+150)=88.5 For individual SLA reports, the uptime score only includes the selected monitor. Apdex: The average Apdex across all monitors. Monitors have a default Apdex T of 7 seconds, but you can customize Apdex T for individual monitors by editing their settings. Apdex F, which defines a frustrating result, is always four times Apdex T. For more information about Apdex, see Apdex: Measuring user satisfaction. For individual SLA reports, the Apdex score only includes the selected monitor. % Satisfied: The percentage of monitor results which complete in a \"satisfying\" time. A satisfying time is defined as a monitor result that completes in Apdex T or less. % Toleration: The percentage of monitor results which complete in a \"tolerable\" time. A tolerable time is greater than Apdex T, but less than Apdex F (four times Apdex T). % Frustrated: The percentage of monitor results which complete in a \"frustrating\" time. A frustrating time is greater than Apdex F (four times Apdex T). The account-wide SLA report includes all monitor types (ping, simple browser, scripted browser, and API test).

      "body": "Read on to learn about synthetic monitoring's proxy settings and properties. Proxy settings API for scripted monitors Important You can set proxy server configuration for synthetic scripted monitors for monitor versions 0.4.0 or higher. The global object $network allows you to control the network configuration used by your synthetic scripted monitors. The following are applicable for both scripted browsers and API tests, unless otherwise stated. $network.setProxy(string or object PROXY URL) Sets a proxy server to be used for all per-URL requests (HTTP, HTTPS, and FTP). Additional notes: The port is optional. If not provided, it will be derived from the scheme. For example, for HTTP the port would be 80. The username and password are assumed to be the result of a call to encodeURIComponent(). Special characters like @ and : in the username and/or the password must be escaped. Returns This method returns a Promise that will resolve once the configuration has been applied. Parameters Parameter Data Type Description proxyURL | proxyUrlParsed String or Object The URL to connect to the proxy server. A string containing a proxyURL (for example, http://proxy_host:8888) or a plain object in the same format as defined by Node's url.parse(urlString) method. Examples An example of setting a proxy server with HTTP protocol on port 1234 with no authentication: $network.setProxy('http://host.com:1234') Copy An example of setting a proxy server with HTTP protocol with authentication credentials. $network.setProxy('http://proxyUsername:proxyPassword@proxyHost:1234') Copy $network.setProxyForHttp(string or object PROXY URL) Tip This call is exactly the same as the per-URL setProxy call, except that it applies to HTTP traffic. Sets a proxy server to be used for all HTTP requests. Additional notes: The port is optional. If not provided, it will be derived from the scheme. For example, for HTTP the port would be 80. The username and password are assumed to be the result of a call to encodeURIComponent(). Special characters like @ and : in the username and/or the password must be escaped. Returns This method returns a Promise that will resolve once the configuration has been applied. Parameters Parameter Data Type Description proxyURL | proxyUrlParsed String or Object The URL to connect to the proxy server. A string containing a proxyURL (for example, http://proxy_host:8888) or a plain object in the same format as defined by Node's url.parse(urlString) method. Examples An example of setting a proxy server with HTTP protocol on port 1234 with no authentication: $network.setProxyForHttp('http://host.com:1234') Copy An example of setting a proxy server with HTTP protocol with authentication credentials. $network.setProxyForHttp('http://proxyUsername:proxyPassword@proxyHost:1234') Copy $network.setProxyForHttps(string or object PROXY URL) Tip This call is exactly the same as the per-URL setProxy call, except that it applies to HTTPS traffic. Sets a proxy server to be used for all HTTPS requests. Additional notes: The port is optional. If not provided, it will be derived from the scheme. For example, for HTTP the default port would be 443. The username and password are assumed to be the result of a call to encodeURIComponent(). Special characters like @ and : in the username and/or the password must be escaped. Returns This method returns a Promise that will resolve once the configuration has been applied. Parameters Parameter Data Type Description proxyURL | proxyUrlParsed String or Object The URL to connect to the proxy server. A string containing a proxyURL (for example, http://proxy_host:8888) or a plain object in the same format as defined by Node's url.parse(urlString) method. Examples An example of setting a proxy server with HTTPS protocol on port 1234 with no authentication: $network.setProxyForHttps('https://host.com:1234') Copy An example of setting a proxy server with HTTPS protocol with authentication credentials. $network.setProxyForHttps('https://proxyUsername:proxyPassword@proxyHost:1234') Copy $network.setProxyPAC(string PAC SCRIPT URL, object AUTH OBJECT) Sets a proxy server via a proxy auto-config (PAC) script and returns a promise. This function is only available for scripted browser monitors. Returns This method returns a Promise that will resolve once the configuration has been applied. Parameters Parameter Data Type Description scriptURL String The URL of the PAC script. authCredentialsMap Object Map of authentication credentials to be provided to the proxy server(s), keyed by the hostnames of the proxy server. Values of this map must be defined in the format {username: 'authUsername', password: 'authPassword'} Examples An example of setting a proxy server via a proxy auto-config (PAC) script: var authCredentialsMap = { 'example.com': {username: 'authUsername', password: 'authPassword'}, } Copy $network.setProxyAdvanced(object PROXY RULES OBJECT) Tip This method is Chrome-specific: it only applies to scripted browser monitor types. It can be used to allow for a more flexible and complex proxy configuration. In most cases, this method will not be needed. Sets the proxy configuration using the format supported by Chrome Extension API for Proxying. The input is a ProxyRules object, as defined by the Chrome Extension API to configures proxies. You can add authCredentials for proxies that need it. See Parameters for more details. Returns This method returns a Promise that will resolve once the configuration has been applied. Parameters Parameter Data Type Description ProxyRules Object Object The proxyRulesObject is a plain object that follows the format ProxyRules as defined by the Chrome Extension API to configures proxies. This object is \"flavoured\" to fit our runtime: users can define an additional property, authCredentials, for the Proxy server objects to provide authentication credentials for a specific proxy server. authCredentials is an object in the format {username: 'authUsername', password: 'authPassword'}. Examples Here's an example of creating a proxyRules with authCredentials: var proxyRules = { singleProxy: { host:\"example.com\", authCredentials: { username: 'authUsername', password: 'authPassword' } } }; Copy Here's an example of setting up a proxied network with mixed network zone assets: var proxyRules = {singleProxy: {host:\"http://entproxy.mycompany.com\"}, bypassList:['s3.amazonaws.com','*.localcdn.com'] } $network.setProxyAdvanced(proxyRules) Copy $network.clearProxy() Clears/removes the current proxy configuration. Returns This method returns a Promise that will resolve once the configuration has been applied. $network.getProxy() This method returns the current proxy configuration. It must be synchronized in a promise callback. Examples An example of synchronizing getProxy with $network.setProxy(); and $network.clearProxy();: var assert = require('assert'); $network.setProxy(\"http://user:password@myproxyurl.com\") .then(function () { console.log('Proxy configuration applied'); //Note: $network.getProxy() is not synchronized with the webdriver Control Flow. //To make sure we get the proxy configuration after the call to setProxy() above // succeeds we need to use a promise callback var proxyData = $network.getProxy(); console.log(proxyData); }) .then(function () { // Again: getProxy() is not synchronized with the Webdriver Control Flow: we //need this promise callback otherwise clearProxy() might be called before the call // to getProxy() above returns return $network.clearProxy(); }) .then(function () { console.log('Proxy configuration cleared'); // We need this promise callback for reasons explained above var proxyData = $network.getProxy(); assert.equal(proxyData.rules, null); }); Copy Proxy properties Important This proxy information applies only to these versions: API monitors: 0.4.0, 0.2.2, 0.2.1, 0.1.0 Scripted monitors: 0.1.0 In order to analyze and collect your HTTP traffic metrics, New Relic must ensure the traffic passes through a conceptual funnel. Our synthetic monitoring includes a software funnel component capable of analyzing the HTTP requests or responses and then recording the information. New Relic's scripted browser monitors (versions 0.4.x and lower) include a mechanism to do this analysis without needing an HTTP proxy, so you don't have to configure anything. New Relic's API test (versions 0.4.x and lower) provides an $http object that is pre-configured to make the requests pass through the internal HTTP proxy. This allows you to write your test without including any proxy settings. If you want to use some other way to generate HTTP traffic while still collecting the HTTP traffic metrics, you can use $env.PROXY_HOST and $env.PROXY_PORT. To record traffic metrics, be sure to include these properties in your script.

      "body": "Synthetic monitors are API checks or virtual browser instances that monitor your website, recording each check in detail. They can also capture aggregate numbers, including an overview, or summary for ping monitors, detailed statistics for each page resource, and downtime incidents. Synthetic monitoring also collects custom response codes for more detail on your monitor runs. For a description of synthetic monitor types, see Types of monitor. Add a monitor There are several types of synthetic monitor to add. Ping monitors ensure your website is responding, while simple browser monitors send real browsers to check your website. For more complex monitoring, scripted browser monitors verify that specific resources are present, while API tests verify your API endpoint. Add a ping or simple browser monitor Go to one.newrelic.com > Synthetics > Create monitor. Specify a monitor type, name, and URL. Optional: Add a validation string or Advanced options: A validation string is available for ping and simple browser. This option enables substring monitoring for response validation. Verify SSL is available for ping and simple browser. This option verifies the validity of the SSL certificate chain. It can be duplicated by running the following syntax: openssl s_client -servername {YOUR_HOSTNAME} -connect {YOUR_HOSTNAME}:443 -CApath /etc/ssl/certs -verify_hostname {YOUR_HOSTNAME} > /dev/null Copy If a non-zero exit code is returned, the monitor will fail. The Bypass HEAD request option is available for ping. This option skips the default HEAD request and instead uses the GET verb with a ping check. Redirect is Failure is available for ping. If a redirect result occurs when Redirect is Failure is enabled, New Relic Synthetics will categorize the result as a failure, rather than following the redirect and checking the resulting URL. Select the locations from which you want your monitor to run. Choose a frequency to determine how often each location will run your monitor. Optional: Set up alert notifications. Select Create my monitor to confirm. Wait a few minutes, then check your monitor from the Monitors index. Add a scripted browser or API test monitor Go to one.newrelic.com > Synthetics > Create monitor. Specify a monitor type and name. Select the locations from which you want your monitor to run. Choose a frequency to determine how often each location will run your monitor. Optional: Set up alert notifications. Select Next: Write your script to create a script for your scripted browser or API test, then select Validate to verify your syntax. Tip For complex scripts, validation may take up to one minute. Select Create my monitor to confirm. Wait a few minutes, then check your monitor from the Monitors index. Add a step monitor Go to one.newrelic.com > Synthetics > Create monitor. Select step monitor as the monitor type. Specify a name and choose a frequency to determine how often each location will run your monitor. Select the locations from which you want your monitor to run. Build your monitor by selecting from the preconfigured steps at the bottom of the UI: Navigate to a URL Type text Click an element Assert text Assert an element Secure a credential Use the instructions on the right side of the UI to help locate elements by CSS class, HTML ID, link text, or XPath. Select Save monitor to confirm. Wait a few minutes, then check your monitor from the Monitors index. Add a certificate check monitor Go to one.newrelic.com > Synthetics > Create monitor. Select the certificate check monitor type. Specify a name and enter the domain you'd like to monitor. Enter the number of days it takes for your certificate to expire. Select the period to determine your monitor's frequency. Optional: Add tags to help you find this monitor later. Select the locations from which you want your monitor to run, and then click Save monitor to confirm. Wait a few minutes, then check your monitor from the Monitors index. Add a broken links monitor Go to one.newrelic.com > Synthetics > Create monitor. Select the broken links check monitor type. Specify a name and enter the URL you'd like to monitor. Select the period to determine your monitor's frequency. Optional: Add tags to help you find this monitor later. Select the locations from which you want your monitor to run, and then click Save monitor to confirm. Wait a few minutes, then check your monitor from the Monitors index. Tip You can also use the Synthetics REST API to add monitors. For example, you can create a GET request to the monitor you want to use as the source for configuration, then use those key values to use in a POST to \"copy\" and create a new monitor. Edit a monitor To edit an existing monitor: From the Monitors tab in one.newrelic.com > Synthetics, select the monitor you want to edit. In the side menu, select a link to change the following settings: Select Settings > General to edit name, Apdex T, URL, locations, frequency, and advanced options. For Scripted browser and API test monitors, select Settings > Script to edit your monitor script. For synthetic monitoring alerts, click Manage alerts. Select Save changes to confirm. Important You cannot change a monitor's type after the monitor is created. Delete a monitor To delete a monitor: From the Monitors tab in one.newrelic.com > Synthetics, select the monitor you want to edit. From the selected monitor, select Settings > General. Scroll to the bottom of the page and select the trash can icon. Tip You can also use the Synthetics REST API to delete a monitor. Monitor settings When configuring monitors, the following settings are available: Type Select the type of monitor you want to create. A monitor's type can't be changed after the monitor is created. Ping: Specify a single URL to monitor for availability. New Relic will check this URL via HEAD or GET requests. The non-configurable timeout for this monitor is 60 seconds. Simple browser: Specify a single URL to monitor via real browser. Once each frequency interval, New Relic will check this URL via a Selenium-powered Google Chrome browser. The non-configurable timeout for this monitor is 60 seconds. Scripted browser: Create a script to drive a Selenium-powered Google Chrome browser. The browser follows each step in the script to verify that complex behavior is working as expected (for example, searching a website, then clicking one of the search results). The non-configurable timeout for this monitor is 180 seconds. API test: Create an API script to ensure your API endpoint is working correctly. For more information, see Write API tests. The non-configurable timeout for this monitor is 180 seconds. Monitor name Defines a name for the monitor. Monitor names cannot contain unencoded angle brackets (< >). To include angle brackets in a monitor name, encode them as HTML bracket entities (&lt; &gt;) in the UI or API. Location Select the locations where you want your monitor to run. Select more locations to ensure that your application is available to users around the world. If you have any private locations, they will be listed here too. You can use the Synthetics API location endpoint to retrieve a list of valid locations for your account. Your monitor will run one check from each selected location during each frequency interval. For example, if you select three locations and define a frequency of 15 minutes, your monitor will run three checks in each 15 minute period (or 8,640 checks per month). Frequency Select how often the monitor runs, in increments of minutes, hours, or 1 day. This frequency applies to each location. For example, if you select three locations and a Frequency of 15 minutes, your monitor will run three checks, on average every 5 minutes, in each 15 minute period (or 8,640 checks per month). Alerts Specify an email address to receive alerts when a monitor fails. Or, attach a monitor to an existing alert policy for more notification options. For more information, see Alerting for synthetic monitoring. Apdex T Customize the Apdex T for this monitor. This setting is only available when editing the settings for an existing monitor, not when creating a new monitor. Change the Apdex T from the default 7 seconds for more accurate Apdex scores in your SLA reports. For example, if you have a very long scripted browser, you might adjust the Apdex T to 15 seconds to more closely reflect the usual completion time. Similarly, a good Apdex T for a simple browser check might be only 2 seconds. Response Validation (optional) Specify text to search for on the page. When using simple browser or ping monitor types, there is a 1MB (10^6 bytes) limit on the page load.

      "body": "Here are some limits, requirements, and recommendations when you create metrics from events, logs, or spans. Metric aggregation Your NRQL query must use one of the following summary, uniqueCount, or distribution functions to aggregate metrics: Function Comments summary Creates a summary metric data point for each time window (currently 1 minute). Use this if your NRQL query uses aggregator functions supported by the summary metric type, such as average, sum, min, or max. Example rule-creation query: SELECT summary(duration) AS 'service.responseTime' FROM Transaction WHERE appName = 'Data Points Staging' FACET name, appName, host Copy uniqueCount Creates a uniqueCount metric data point for each 1-minute time window. Use this if your NRQL query uses the uniqueCount aggregator type. Example rule-creation query: FROM Transaction SELECT uniqueCount(request.headers.userAgent) AS 'server.request.header.userAgent.uniqueCount' WHERE appName = 'Browser Monitoring Router' FACET httpResponseCode, name, appName, host Copy distribution Creates a distribution metric data point for each 1-minute time window. Use this if your NRQL query uses aggregator functions such as percentile, histogram, min, max, average, sum, or count. Use only the attribute of interest as the argument, and discard the rest of the arguments from percentile or histogram. The generated metric supports any argument on percentile or histogram. Example of creating a distribution rule: SELECT distribution(duration) AS 'service.responseTime' FROM Transaction WHERE appName = 'Data Points Staging' FACET name, appName, host Copy Simple count: summary(1) and sum If you want a metric that's a simple count of the events, logs, or spans that match a particular WHERE clause, use the summary(1) metric. This metric type counts the number of specified events, logs, or spans per minute. When querying the created metric, use the sum method to see the result. Example: If you want to create a metric named foo.count that counts the transactions named foo, the NRQL would look like this: FROM Transaction SELECT summary(1) AS 'foo.count' WHERE name = 'foo' Copy Then, you would query it like this: FROM Metric SELECT sum(foo.count) SINCE 30 minutes ago Copy For more information about metrics, see our documentation about metric types. Rule-creation limits These limits affect metric rules creation: Limits Comments Account limits An account can have a maximum of 1,000 metric-creation rules. Metric rule limits A rule can: Create a maximum of 10 metrics. Use only one type of data (events, logs, or spans). Select a maximum of 20 attributes (facets) to include on a metric. Time window limits 50K limit on unique metric-name/attribute-value combinations for a single metric in a 24-hour time window. If this limit is exceeded, the rule is disabled and an NrIntegrationError event is created in that account that includes: The rule details A message about having too many facets A newRelicFeature attribute value of eventToMetric Limits on metric name and attribute value combinations The limit on total unique metric name/attribute value combinations in a 24-hour time window for an account is: Equal to three times the purchased monthly average data points per minute Up to a maximum of 10M Cardinality limits Rule-creation limits include limits on the number of unique combinations of metric name and attribute values. This limit exists because a large number of attributes and/or attribute values can lead to an exponential increase in the size of data reported. Example metric creation rule that attaches five attributes: FROM ProcessSample SELECT summary(ioTotalReadBytes) WHERE entityType = 'ComputeSample' FACET awsRegion, awsAvailabilityZone, commandName, entityName, processId Copy If each of the five attributes reported ten unique values within a one-minute time window, the number of unique metric-name/attribute combinations would theoretically have a maximum of 10x10x10x10x10, or 100,000. Multiple attributes with multiple unique values can lead to a large number of unique metric entries. In practice, this isn't usually the case, because attributes are often related. For example, if one attribute is hostname and another is awsRegion, when you see hostname A, it will always be in AWS region B; you'd never see hostname A and other AWS region values. This is why it's important, during the NRQL creation process, to use the uniqueCount function to verify how many unique metric-name/attribute-value combinations your NRQL query is generating. Multiple metrics from one rule A rule can create up to ten metrics. There are no functional differences between metrics created one at a time and those created with a single rule. Reasons for creating multiple metrics with a single rule: Less likely to reach rules-per-account limit. Easier to add the same attributes to multiple metrics. Example creating multiple metrics with a single rule: FROM Transaction SELECT uniqueCount(request.headers.userAgent) AS 'server.request.header.userAgent.uniqueCount', summary(duration) AS 'server.duration', summary(totalTime) AS 'server.totalTime' WHERE appName = 'Browser Monitoring Router' FACET httpResponseCode, name, appName, host Copy Metric naming A metric is given a name with the AS clause, as part of the NRQL rule-creation process. In the following NRQL example, the name of the metric is io.totalread.bytes: FROM ProcessSample SELECT summary(ioTotalReadBytes) AS 'io.totalread.bytes' WHERE entityType = 'ComputeSample' FACET awsRegion, awsAvailabilityZone, commandName Copy If there is no name assigned with the AS clause, the metric name is the name of the queried attribute. In this example, if no name was assigned, the metric name would be ioTotalReadBytes. Metric names Requirements and recommendations Requirements Requirements for naming a metric: Less than or equal to 255 (UTF-16) 16-bit code units. One way to ensure you are under the limit is to keep each string under 127 of whatever is easiest to count. No spaces. Start with a letter. Examples of strong metric names: rubyvm.memory.heap_used redis.container.cpu.percent memcached.process_virtual_memory.bytes Length and structure Decide on a name and structure that makes it easy for others to find, understand, and use this metric. We recommend keeping your metric name under 40 characters for ideal readability. Longer names can get cut off or overlap with other names. Your metric naming scheme will depend on your business logic. You may want to use namespaces to prefix your metric name, or your names may need to be more general. Components within the name If you want to create components within your metric name (like the source of metrics and the thing you’re measuring), we recommend going from broad to specific (left to right): Use a dot to separate those components in order to be consistent with our New Relic metric names. Then, use an underscore to separate words within the dots. Example: application.page_view.duration Copy Attributes Avoid putting attributes in your metric name. Attributes are qualities of your metric that you can use to filter or facet your data, like cluster or availability zone. Example: If you included availability zone in your metric name, it would mean, for that metric, you wouldn’t be able to see results across all availability zones. Changing metric names If you change a metric name, historical data will not be updated to that new name. To query or chart that historical data, you will need to specify the older metric name.",

      "body": "Use New Relic's metrics API service to define rules for creating metrics from your other types of data, such as events, logs, or spans. Recommendation: Before you begin, review our requirements and tips for creating rules. Create a metrics rule To create a rule for creating metrics from events, logs, or spans: Construct the metrics rule using NRQL. Construct a NerdGraph (GraphQL format) API request that contains your NRQL rule. Create the metric by making the API request. Once a metric is created, you can query and chart it using NRQL. Step 1. Create NRQL query rule The most important part of creating a metrics rule is constructing the NRQL query that defines the metric for your data from events, logs, or spans. You can create up to 10 metrics with a single NRQL query by following this procedure: Using New Relic's NRQL interface, construct a query for the metric you want to create. For example: FROM ProcessSample SELECT average(ioTotalReadBytes) WHERE nr.entityType = 'HOST' Copy Edit the query to use one of the three available metric types: summary: Use if the query's function is min, max, sum, count, or average. uniqueCount: Use if the query's function is uniqueCount. distribution: Use if the query's function is percentile or histogram. This example query uses average, so use summary: FROM ProcessSample SELECT summary (ioTotalReadBytes) WHERE nr.entityType = 'HOST' Copy This example query uses count on a non-numeric field: FROM ProcessSample SELECT count(hostname) WHERE hostname LIKE '%prod%' Copy For summary on a non-numeric field use summary(1): FROM ProcessSample SELECT summary(1) WHERE hostname LIKE '%prod%' Copy Tip For more detailed information on using these metric types in rules, see Creating metric rules: requirements and tips. Decide on the attributes you want to attach to the metric, following the limits on the cardinality of unique metric-name/attribute-value combinations. Recommendation: Run a separate query to ensure this count isn't over 50,000 for a 24-hour window. For example: FROM ProcessSample SELECT uniqueCount(awsRegion, awsAvailabilityZone, commandName) WHERE nr.entityType = 'HOST' SINCE 1 DAY AGO Copy To be able to aggregate and filter your metrics, add the attributes you want to attach to the metric using the FACET clause. For example: FROM ProcessSample SELECT summary(ioTotalReadBytes) WHERE nr.entityType = 'HOST' FACET awsRegion, awsAvailabilityZone, commandName Copy Set the name of the metric using the AS function. For example: FROM ProcessSample SELECT summary(ioTotalReadBytes) AS 'io.totalread.bytes' WHERE nr.entityType = 'HOST' FACET awsRegion, awsAvailabilityZone, commandName Copy Once your NRQL rule is complete, use it to create the API request. Step 2. Create API request After you build the NRQL rule to convert data from events, logs, or spans to metrics, continue with building the API request. You can use our NerdGraph API tool to explore the data structure and to construct and make your request. To check that the rule was created correctly, you can run a query to return that rule using its ID. For tips on querying the metrics you've created, see Query and chart your metrics. Example NerdGraph API request The following example NerdGraph API request uses the same NRQL rule from step 1. The IO Total Read Bytes Rule creates a metric named io.totalread.bytes. (The rule name can have spaces, which differs from the metric naming rules.) mutation { eventsToMetricsCreateRule(rules: { name: \"io.totalread.bytes for computeSample entities\", description:\"Created by Zach on March 27, 2019. Used by team Network.\", nrql:\"FROM ProcessSample SELECT summary(ioTotalReadBytes) AS 'io.totalread.bytes' WHERE nr.entityType = 'ComputeSample' FACET awsRegion, awsAvailabilityZone, commandName\", accountId: 123456 }) { successes { id name nrql enabled } failures { submitted { name nrql accountId } errors { reason description } } } } Copy In this request: Request elements Description mutation One of the basic API operation types. eventsToMetricsCreateRule The method being called to create a rule. rules Takes four parameters: name: The name of the rule. description: Optional. The description of the rule. We recommend you include information about who created the metric data and who will be using the data. accountId: The New Relic account ID where the events, logs, or spans live and the metrics will be created. nrql: The NRQL query that creates the rule. For more on this, see Create NRQL query. successes and submitted blocks Here you define the data returned by a successful or failed response. Available parameters for these blocks include: id (ruleId for submitted) name description nrql enabled (enabled/disabled status) accountId ruleId and accountId If a failure occurs, then the submitted ruleId and accountId will be returned along with the error reason and error description. Example NerdGraph API response Here's an example of a returned response: { \"data\": { \"eventsToMetricsCreateRule\": { \"failures\": [], \"successes\": [ { \"enabled\": true, \"id\": \"46\", \"name\": \"io.totalread.bytes for computeSample entities\", \"nrql\": \"FROM ProcessSample SELECT summary(ioTotalReadBytes) AS 'io.totalread.bytes' WHERE nr.entityType = 'ComputeSample' FACET awsRegion, awsAvailabilityZone, commandName\" } ] } } } Copy Step 3. Create a metrics rule with API request When your API request is ready, you can use the NerdGraph API to make the request, which will create the metrics. Query and chart your metrics After you create a metrics rule to convert data for your events, logs, or spans, you can view the new metric data in the New Relic UI. To view your data: Go to New Relic's NRQL query interface. Run the following query to see the name of all your metrics: SELECT uniques(metricName) FROM Metric Copy Pick the metric of interest, then run the following query to see the available attributes: SELECT * FROM Metric where metricName = 'yourMetric' Copy If you don't see expected data, follow the troubleshooting procedures. The available NRQL aggregator functions depend on the metric type you created. Here are some examples. Summary metric example If you created a summary metric type, you can use the count, sum, max, min, and average aggregator functions, as shown in the following query: SELECT count(appStartResponseTime), sum(appStartResponseTime), max(appStartResponseTime), min(appStartResponseTime), average(appStartResponseTime) FROM Metric Copy Count metric example If you created a uniqueCount metric type, you can only use the uniqueCount function, as shown in the following query: SELECT uniqueCount(playbackErrorStreamUniqueCount) * 100 / uniqueCount(streamUniqueCount) AS '% of Streams Impacted' FROM Metric Copy Distribution metric example If you created a distribution metric type, use the percentile or histogram functions, as shown in the following queries: SELECT percentile(service.responseTime, 95) FROM Metric Copy OR SELECT histogram(service.responseTime, 10, 20) FROM Metric Copy Troubleshooting If your NerdGraph call is not constructed correctly, you may receive a message like this: Cannot parse the unexpected character \"\\u201C” Copy Verify the quotes in the NerdGraph call are not smart quotes (curly quotes). Our NerdGraph API only accepts straight quotes.",

Then we count the bytes needed to represent your data in a standard format, like JSON. If you're on our New Relic One pricing plan, you're charged by the number of bytes written to our database, above and beyond the standard amount that’s free. Important This doc is for accounts on our New Relic One pricing plan. If you're on our original product-based pricing plan, see Original data retention. Not sure which you're on? See Overview of pricing and user model. The Data ingestion page shows your ingest rates for a period you specify on the top-right of the Data management hub. Since 30 days ago is the default setting, but you can also set a custom date span. The page shows your daily average GBs, and the total for the range you set. You can toggle between an overall ingest view and an account view to identify which of your accounts are sending the most data. The page also provides the current month-to-date, and the projected end-of-month total ingest rates. With this information, you can proactively drop data or turn off agents in order to manage ingest and, therefore, costs. If you want to take a look at how we query the data, click the ellipsis icon (just above the chart) to slide out the chart query and open it in our query builder.

Billable data sources Description Timeslices (1-minute) and Metric:Raw Metrics are timeslices + MetricRaw Metric group: MetricsBytes Metric timeslice data averages to one-hour periods after eight days. After 90 days, the permanent metric data continues to be stored in one-hour periods. We currently store the raw metric data for 30 days. You are only billed for the initial ingest volume. You are not billed for subsequent rollups. APM (transactions and errors) APM events Metric group: ApmEventsBytes InfraSamples:Raw Includes multiple Infrastructure events Infrastructure host data Metric group:InfraHostBytes Information related to your servers and virtual machines coming from infrastructure agents, including storage and network data Infrastructure process data stored in ProcessSample. Metric group: InfraProcessBytes Data are metrics related to each process running on the hosts running the Infrastructure agent. This feature is turned off by default. Infrastructure integrations Metric group: InfraIntegrationBytes Performance data related to applications and services, typically managed by the customer, including data related to Docker containers, Windows services, Nagios checks, and cloud integrations such as managed services in AWS, Azure, and GCP. Logging Includes logs and LogExtendedRecord Metric group: LoggingBytes Log messages longer than 4KB are split into multiple events that, when needed, are stitched together to display the original message; this reduces the size of message data.

This way, you'll know your baselines, and can more easily spot an anomaly like an ingest spike, as well as its source. To break down your ingested data, start from the chart on the Data ingestion page. Think of the data source bands as the Y axis, and the dates as the X axis. Click on the band you want to inspect at the spot in the X axis that corresponds with the date you want to investigate. This image shows the Metrics band for June 15 right before it's clicked. A modal opens with the account, data source, and facet selected. You can do a handful of things on this page: Change the account, data source, or facet you want to drill down into. Change the date and time to investigate. Review the results of the query in chart form. The chart displays the top 15 results for the facet query. Open the NRQL query in the Query builder where you'll find additional facets that you can use. Learn more about NRQL queries here. How we break your ingest data down Some of the content in the UI is variable, depending on your account. This information is intended to help you understand how we're working with your ingest data. The chart on the Data ingestion page shows data usage for a little longer time frame than that covered by your retention settings for each data ingest source. If you choose a date outside of your designated retention period for an ingest source, you'll get the message that there's no chart data available. Select a more recent date to fix this problem. If you inspect a data source for an account that has less than a terrabyte of data, we compute the ingest volume over a 24 hour period; otherwise, we compute it for a 1 hour period. The ingest value provided on the main Data ingestion chart will be slightly different from that reflected during inspection. This is because our facet computation is an estimate. Set alerts for data use Query and alert on usage data describes how to set alerts to get notified if you're nearing data ingest limits you don't want to cross. For example, you might set an alert on logs, which can stack up quickly in an active system. Adjust your data ingest Drop data for lower retention costs and data compliance On ingest, we apply data dropping rules so you won't be charged for data that's not useful. Learn how to set additional data dropping rules yourself. Use NerdGraph to drop entire data types or drop data attributes from data types so they’re not written to NRDB. This enables you to focus on the data you want, reduces retention costs, and avoids writing sensitive data to the database. For dropping log data, see Drop data with drop filter rules. Turn off agents and integrations If you don’t need data from specific agents or integrations that you have installed, you can uninstall/delete those tools. For instructions, see the specific documentation for an agent or integration.",

      "body": "Here are some limits, requirements, and recommendations when you create metrics from events, logs, or spans. Metric aggregation Your NRQL query must use one of the following summary, uniqueCount, or distribution functions to aggregate metrics: Function Comments summary Creates a summary metric data point for each time window (currently 1 minute). Use this if your NRQL query uses aggregator functions supported by the summary metric type, such as average, sum, min, or max. Example rule-creation query: SELECT summary(duration) AS 'service.responseTime' FROM Transaction WHERE appName = 'Data Points Staging' FACET name, appName, host Copy uniqueCount Creates a uniqueCount metric data point for each 1-minute time window. Use this if your NRQL query uses the uniqueCount aggregator type. Example rule-creation query: FROM Transaction SELECT uniqueCount(request.headers.userAgent) AS 'server.request.header.userAgent.uniqueCount' WHERE appName = 'Browser Monitoring Router' FACET httpResponseCode, name, appName, host Copy distribution Creates a distribution metric data point for each 1-minute time window. Use this if your NRQL query uses aggregator functions such as percentile, histogram, min, max, average, sum, or count. Use only the attribute of interest as the argument, and discard the rest of the arguments from percentile or histogram. The generated metric supports any argument on percentile or histogram. Example of creating a distribution rule: SELECT distribution(duration) AS 'service.responseTime' FROM Transaction WHERE appName = 'Data Points Staging' FACET name, appName, host Copy Simple count: summary(1) and sum If you want a metric that's a simple count of the events, logs, or spans that match a particular WHERE clause, use the summary(1) metric. This metric type counts the number of specified events, logs, or spans per minute. When querying the created metric, use the sum method to see the result. Example: If you want to create a metric named foo.count that counts the transactions named foo, the NRQL would look like this: FROM Transaction SELECT summary(1) AS 'foo.count' WHERE name = 'foo' Copy Then, you would query it like this: FROM Metric SELECT sum(foo.count) SINCE 30 minutes ago Copy For more information about metrics, see our documentation about metric types. Rule-creation limits These limits affect metric rules creation: Limits Comments Account limits An account can have a maximum of 1,000 metric-creation rules. Metric rule limits A rule can: Create a maximum of 10 metrics. Use only one type of data (events, logs, or spans). Select a maximum of 20 attributes (facets) to include on a metric. Time window limits 50K limit on unique metric-name/attribute-value combinations for a single metric in a 24-hour time window. If this limit is exceeded, the rule is disabled and an NrIntegrationError event is created in that account that includes: The rule details A message about having too many facets A newRelicFeature attribute value of eventToMetric Limits on metric name and attribute value combinations The limit on total unique metric name/attribute value combinations in a 24-hour time window for an account is: Equal to three times the purchased monthly average data points per minute Up to a maximum of 10M Cardinality limits Rule-creation limits include limits on the number of unique combinations of metric name and attribute values. This limit exists because a large number of attributes and/or attribute values can lead to an exponential increase in the size of data reported. Example metric creation rule that attaches five attributes: FROM ProcessSample SELECT summary(ioTotalReadBytes) WHERE entityType = 'ComputeSample' FACET awsRegion, awsAvailabilityZone, commandName, entityName, processId Copy If each of the five attributes reported ten unique values within a one-minute time window, the number of unique metric-name/attribute combinations would theoretically have a maximum of 10x10x10x10x10, or 100,000. Multiple attributes with multiple unique values can lead to a large number of unique metric entries. In practice, this isn't usually the case, because attributes are often related. For example, if one attribute is hostname and another is awsRegion, when you see hostname A, it will always be in AWS region B; you'd never see hostname A and other AWS region values. This is why it's important, during the NRQL creation process, to use the uniqueCount function to verify how many unique metric-name/attribute-value combinations your NRQL query is generating. Multiple metrics from one rule A rule can create up to ten metrics. There are no functional differences between metrics created one at a time and those created with a single rule. Reasons for creating multiple metrics with a single rule: Less likely to reach rules-per-account limit. Easier to add the same attributes to multiple metrics. Example creating multiple metrics with a single rule: FROM Transaction SELECT uniqueCount(request.headers.userAgent) AS 'server.request.header.userAgent.uniqueCount', summary(duration) AS 'server.duration', summary(totalTime) AS 'server.totalTime' WHERE appName = 'Browser Monitoring Router' FACET httpResponseCode, name, appName, host Copy Metric naming A metric is given a name with the AS clause, as part of the NRQL rule-creation process. In the following NRQL example, the name of the metric is io.totalread.bytes: FROM ProcessSample SELECT summary(ioTotalReadBytes) AS 'io.totalread.bytes' WHERE entityType = 'ComputeSample' FACET awsRegion, awsAvailabilityZone, commandName Copy If there is no name assigned with the AS clause, the metric name is the name of the queried attribute. In this example, if no name was assigned, the metric name would be ioTotalReadBytes. Metric names Requirements and recommendations Requirements Requirements for naming a metric: Less than or equal to 255 (UTF-16) 16-bit code units. One way to ensure you are under the limit is to keep each string under 127 of whatever is easiest to count. No spaces. Start with a letter. Examples of strong metric names: rubyvm.memory.heap_used redis.container.cpu.percent memcached.process_virtual_memory.bytes Length and structure Decide on a name and structure that makes it easy for others to find, understand, and use this metric. We recommend keeping your metric name under 40 characters for ideal readability. Longer names can get cut off or overlap with other names. Your metric naming scheme will depend on your business logic. You may want to use namespaces to prefix your metric name, or your names may need to be more general. Components within the name If you want to create components within your metric name (like the source of metrics and the thing you’re measuring), we recommend going from broad to specific (left to right): Use a dot to separate those components in order to be consistent with our New Relic metric names. Then, use an underscore to separate words within the dots. Example: application.page_view.duration Copy Attributes Avoid putting attributes in your metric name. Attributes are qualities of your metric that you can use to filter or facet your data, like cluster or availability zone. Example: If you included availability zone in your metric name, it would mean, for that metric, you wouldn’t be able to see results across all availability zones. Changing metric names If you change a metric name, historical data will not be updated to that new name. To query or chart that historical data, you will need to specify the older metric name.",

      "body": "You can generate metric-type data from other types of data in New Relic, including events, logs, and spans. Metrics are aggregates of your data and are optimal for analyzing and monitoring trends over long time periods. This document explains: Reasons to use this feature Available operations How to use our NerdGraph API tool to perform operations Why create metrics from other data types? Using metrics allows for more efficient data storage. This in turn allows you to query your data and build charts more easily. The difference between metrics and other types of data in New Relic is based on time. For more information, see Understand data types. Events, logs, spans: These types of data represent a single record at a specific moment in time. For example, you may have an event for every request to the system. This data is ideal for in-depth troubleshooting and analysis. Metrics: These provide an aggregated view of your events, logs, or spans. Metrics are better for showing trends over longer time ranges. For example, you can aggregate the total number of requests per service to one metric and then examine this information month over month. Why use metrics? Comments Flexibility Metrics are dimensional. You can choose what metadata (like host name or app name) is attached to them. Common metric measurements, like average, sum, minimum, and maximum, are already calculated. Data aggregation and retention The data has already been pre-aggregated into longer-period time buckets. Data retention is 13 months. Query capabilities You can query using the Metric data type. When you create metrics, this does not delete your events or other types of data. However, metrics are better for longer-range querying and charting. To get started converting your data to metrics, create a rule. Available operations To show, create, and delete rules for generating metrics from events, logs, or spans, use NerdGraph, our GraphQL-format API. Before performing any operation, we recommend reading Intro to NerdGraph and exploring your data with the GraphiQL API tool. These operations fall under two basic request types: Mutations, which are operations that make changes to existing rules or settings (for example, creating a new metrics rule). Queries, for fetching existing data (for example, fetching existing metrics rules). All operations are role-based in NerdGraph as the currently logged-in New Relic user. Mutations Mutation operations for events to metrics, logs to metrics, or spans to metrics include: Create a rule See Create metrics. Delete a rule Important This operation modifies production settings, so we recommend thoroughly reviewing your changes before you run the operation. To delete a rule, you need the rule ID and the New Relic account ID. Example request: mutation { eventsToMetricsDeleteRule(deletes: {ruleId: \"12\", accountId: 123456}) { successes { id name nrql } failures { errors { description reason } submitted { ruleId accountId } } } } Copy In this request: Element Description mutation One of the basic API operation types. eventsToMetricsDeleteRule The method being called to delete a rule. deletes This takes two parameters: ruleId: The ID of the rule for events to metrics, logs to metrics, or spans to metrics. accountId: The New Relic account ID. successes and submitted blocks Here you define the data returned by a success or failure. Available parameters for these blocks: id (or ruleId for submitted) name description nrql enabled accountId Example response for the request: { \"data\": { \"eventsToMetricsDeleteRule\": { \"failures\": [], \"successes\": [ { \"id\": \"12\", \"name\": \"Test Rule\", \"nrql\": \"select summary(duration) as 'server.responseTime' from Transaction where appName = 'Data Points Staging' facet name, appName, host\" } ] } } } Copy Enable or disable a rule Important This operation modifies production settings, so we recommend thoroughly reviewing your changes before you run the operation. To enable or disable an existing rule for events to metrics, logs to metrics, or spans to metrics, use the same eventsToMetricsUpdateRule operation. The only difference is whether enabled is set to true or false. Example request to enable an existing metrics rule: mutation { eventsToMetricsUpdateRule(updates: {ruleId: \"12\", accountId: 123456, enabled: true}) { successes { id name nrql } failures { errors { description reason } submitted { ruleId accountId } } } } Copy In this request: Element Description mutation One of the basic API operation types. eventsToMetricsUpdateRule The method being called to update an existing rule and either enable it or disable it. updates This takes three required parameters: ruleId: The ID of the rule for events to metrics, logs to metrics, or spans to metrics. accountId: The New Relic account ID. enabled: To enable a disabled rule, set this to true. To disable a rule, set this to false. successes and submitted blocks Here you define the data returned by a success or failure. Available parameters for these blocks: id (or ruleId for submitted) name description nrql enabled accountId Queries Query operations include: List all rules for a New Relic account You can list all rules in a New Relic account or return a specific rule. Example listing all rules for account 123456: query { actor { account(id:123456) { eventsToMetrics{ allRules{ rules{ id name enabled nrql description } } } } } } Copy In this request: Element Description query One of the basic API operation types. Used to query but not make changes. actor This specifies the current New Relic user. account(id: 123456) Specify the ID for the New Relic account where to retrieve data. eventsToMetrics Scope the data only for events-to-metrics, logs-to-metrics, or spans-to-metrics rules. allRules Returns all rules for that account. rules In the rules block, you can define what data you want returned. Available fields include: id name description nrql accountId enabled Example response: { \"data\": { \"actor\": { \"account\": { \"eventsToMetrics\": { \"allRules\": { \"rules\": [ { \"description\": \"Metric for total time\", \"enabled\": true, \"id\": \"1\", \"name\": \"Total Time Tx\", \"nrql\": \"select summary(totalTime) as 'server.totalTime' from Transaction where appName = 'Data Points Staging' facet name, appName, host\" }, { \"description\": \"Metric for duration\", \"enabled\": true, \"id\": \"2\", \"name\": \"Duration Rule\", \"nrql\": \"select summary(duration) as 'server.responseTime' from Transaction where appName = 'Data Points Staging' facet name, appName, host\" } ] } } } } } } Copy List rule by rule ID If you know the exact ID for a rule, then you can query for a specific rule. For example, you may have just created a rule and now you want to list its contents so you can review it. Example listing rule 36 for New Relic account 123456: query { actor { account(id: 123456) { eventsToMetrics { rulesById(ruleIds: \"36\") { rules { id name enabled nrql description accountId } } } } } } Copy For more details about the elements in this query, see List all rules. Example response: { \"data\": { \"actor\": { \"account\": { \"eventsToMetrics\": { \"rulesById\": { \"rules\": [ { \"accountId\": 123456, \"description\": \"Metric for total time\", \"enabled\": true, \"id\": \"36\", \"name\": \"Total Time Tx\", \"nrql\": \"select summary(totalTime) as 'server.totalTime' from Transaction where appName = 'Data Points Staging' facet name, appName, host\" } ] } } } } } } Copy Use the NerdGraph GraphiQL API tool You can use our GraphiQL tool to explore the data structure. You can also use it to build and run the operations to convert events, logs, and spans to metrics. To use this tool: Create the metrics operation's request with the required parameters. Go to api.newrelic.com/graphiql, and paste your query into the box. To execute the operation, press Play. Or, to get the cURL format, select Copy as cURL.) Validate the response in the response box. Optional: To verify that your rule-creation operation was performed successfully, run a list query for that rule ID.",

Then we count the bytes needed to represent your data in a standard format, like JSON. If you're on our New Relic One pricing plan, you're charged by the number of bytes written to our database, above and beyond the standard amount that’s free. Important This doc is for accounts on our New Relic One pricing plan. If you're on our original product-based pricing plan, see Original data retention. Not sure which you're on? See Overview of pricing and user model. The Data ingestion page shows your ingest rates for a period you specify on the top-right of the Data management hub. Since 30 days ago is the default setting, but you can also set a custom date span. The page shows your daily average GBs, and the total for the range you set. You can toggle between an overall ingest view and an account view to identify which of your accounts are sending the most data. The page also provides the current month-to-date, and the projected end-of-month total ingest rates. With this information, you can proactively drop data or turn off agents in order to manage ingest and, therefore, costs. If you want to take a look at how we query the data, click the ellipsis icon (just above the chart) to slide out the chart query and open it in our query builder. And If you want to drill down further into your data usage, check out the sample queries in the usage docs. From the Login drop-down, select Manage your data, and then select Data ingestion. This is the Data ingestion page with data source and account views. Data ingestion sources The Data ingestion page describes which of your data sources provide the most data on average and during specific data ranges. The sources are described here. Billable data sources Description Timeslices (1-minute) and Metric:Raw Metrics are timeslices + MetricRaw Metric group: MetricsBytes Metric timeslice data averages to one-hour periods after eight days. After 90 days, the permanent metric data continues to be stored in one-hour periods. We currently store the raw metric data for 30 days. You are only billed for the initial ingest volume. You are not billed for subsequent rollups. APM (transactions and errors) APM events Metric group: ApmEventsBytes InfraSamples:Raw Includes multiple Infrastructure events Infrastructure host data Metric group:InfraHostBytes Information related to your servers and virtual machines coming from infrastructure agents, including storage and network data Infrastructure process data stored in ProcessSample. Metric group: InfraProcessBytes Data are metrics related to each process running on the hosts running the Infrastructure agent. This feature is turned off by default. Infrastructure integrations Metric group: InfraIntegrationBytes Performance data related to applications and services, typically managed by the customer, including data related to Docker containers, Windows services, Nagios checks, and cloud integrations such as managed services in AWS, Azure, and GCP. Logging Includes logs and LogExtendedRecord Metric group: LoggingBytes Log messages longer than 4KB are split into multiple events that, when needed, are stitched together to display the original message; this reduces the size of message data. Default Custom events Metric group: CustomEventsBytes Mobile error Mobile general Breadcrumb crash event trails Mobile session Mobile exception Mobile crash Mobile events Metric group: MobileEventsBytes Tracing Metric group: TracingBytes TracingBytes includes Span and OpenTelemetry's SpanEvent.

Browser:EventLog Browser Browser:JSErrors PcvPerf (PageView timing) Browser events Metric group: BrowserEventsBytes Lambda Serverless Metric group: ServerlessBytes Break down data to see what's contributing to your ingest You can inspect your data ingest to gain more information about your ingest health. This way, you'll know your baselines, and can more easily spot an anomaly like an ingest spike, as well as its source. To break down your ingested data, start from the chart on the Data ingestion page. Think of the data source bands as the Y axis, and the dates as the X axis. Click on the band you want to inspect at the spot in the X axis that corresponds with the date you want to investigate. This image shows the Metrics band for June 15 right before it's clicked. A modal opens with the account, data source, and facet selected. You can do a handful of things on this page: Change the account, data source, or facet you want to drill down into. Change the date and time to investigate. Review the results of the query in chart form. The chart displays the top 15 results for the facet query. Open the NRQL query in the Query builder where you'll find additional facets that you can use. Learn more about NRQL queries here. How we break your ingest data down Some of the content in the UI is variable, depending on your account. This information is intended to help you understand how we're working with your ingest data. The chart on the Data ingestion page shows data usage for a little longer time frame than that covered by your retention settings for each data ingest source. If you choose a date outside of your designated retention period for an ingest source, you'll get the message that there's no chart data available. Select a more recent date to fix this problem. If you inspect a data source for an account that has less than a terrabyte of data, we compute the ingest volume over a 24 hour period; otherwise, we compute it for a 1 hour period. The ingest value provided on the main Data ingestion chart will be slightly different from that reflected during inspection. This is because our facet computation is an estimate. Set alerts for data use Query and alert on usage data describes how to set alerts to get notified if you're nearing data ingest limits you don't want to cross. For example, you might set an alert on logs, which can stack up quickly in an active system. Adjust your data ingest Drop data for lower retention costs and data compliance On ingest, we apply data dropping rules so you won't be charged for data that's not useful. Learn how to set additional data dropping rules yourself. Use NerdGraph to drop entire data types or drop data attributes from data types so they’re not written to NRDB. This enables you to focus on the data you want, reduces retention costs, and avoids writing sensitive data to the database. For dropping log data, see Drop data with drop filter rules. Turn off agents and integrations If you don’t need data from specific agents or integrations that you have installed, you can uninstall/delete those tools. For instructions, see the specific documentation for an agent or integration.",

Metrics are aggregates of your data and are optimal for analyzing and monitoring trends over long time periods. This document explains: Reasons to use this feature Available operations How to use our NerdGraph API tool to perform operations Why create metrics from other data types? Using metrics allows for more efficient data storage. This in turn allows you to query your data and build charts more easily. The difference between metrics and other types of data in New Relic is based on time. For more information, see Understand data types. Events, logs, spans: These types of data represent a single record at a specific moment in time. For example, you may have an event for every request to the system. This data is ideal for in-depth troubleshooting and analysis. Metrics: These provide an aggregated view of your events, logs, or spans. Metrics are better for showing trends over longer time ranges. For example, you can aggregate the total number of requests per service to one metric and then examine this information month over month. Why use metrics? Comments Flexibility Metrics are dimensional. You can choose what metadata (like host name or app name) is attached to them. Common metric measurements, like average, sum, minimum, and maximum, are already calculated. Data aggregation and retention The data has already been pre-aggregated into longer-period time buckets. Data retention is 13 months. Query capabilities You can query using the Metric data type. When you create metrics, this does not delete your events or other types of data. However, metrics are better for longer-range querying and charting. To get started converting your data to metrics, create a rule. Available operations To show, create, and delete rules for generating metrics from events, logs, or spans, use NerdGraph, our GraphQL-format API. Before performing any operation, we recommend reading Intro to NerdGraph and exploring your data with the GraphiQL API tool. These operations fall under two basic request types: Mutations, which are operations that make changes to existing rules or settings (for example, creating a new metrics rule). Queries, for fetching existing data (for example, fetching existing metrics rules). All operations are role-based in NerdGraph as the currently logged-in New Relic user. Mutations Mutation operations for events to metrics, logs to metrics, or spans to metrics include: Create a rule See Create metrics. Delete a rule Important This operation modifies production settings, so we recommend thoroughly reviewing your changes before you run the operation. To delete a rule, you need the rule ID and the New Relic account ID. Example request: mutation { eventsToMetricsDeleteRule(deletes: {ruleId: \"12\", accountId: 123456}) { successes { id name nrql } failures { errors { description reason } submitted { ruleId accountId } } } } Copy In this request: Element Description mutation One of the basic API operation types. eventsToMetricsDeleteRule The method being called to delete a rule. deletes This takes two parameters: ruleId: The ID of the rule for events to metrics, logs to metrics, or spans to metrics. accountId: The New Relic account ID. successes and submitted blocks Here you define the data returned by a success or failure. Available parameters for these blocks: id (or ruleId for submitted) name description nrql enabled accountId Example response for the request: { \"data\": { \"eventsToMetricsDeleteRule\": { \"failures\": [], \"successes\": [ { \"id\": \"12\", \"name\": \"Test Rule\", \"nrql\": \"select summary(duration) as 'server.responseTime' from Transaction where appName = 'Data Points Staging' facet name, appName, host\" } ] } } } Copy Enable or disable a rule Important This operation modifies production settings, so we recommend thoroughly reviewing your changes before you run the operation. To enable or disable an existing rule for events to metrics, logs to metrics, or spans to metrics, use the same eventsToMetricsUpdateRule operation. The only difference is whether enabled is set to true or false. Example request to enable an existing metrics rule: mutation { eventsToMetricsUpdateRule(updates: {ruleId: \"12\", accountId: 123456, enabled: true}) { successes { id name nrql } failures { errors { description reason } submitted { ruleId accountId } } } } Copy In this request: Element Description mutation One of the basic API operation types. eventsToMetricsUpdateRule The method being called to update an existing rule and either enable it or disable it. updates This takes three required parameters: ruleId: The ID of the rule for events to metrics, logs to metrics, or spans to metrics. accountId: The New Relic account ID. enabled: To enable a disabled rule, set this to true. To disable a rule, set this to false. successes and submitted blocks Here you define the data returned by a success or failure. Available parameters for these blocks: id (or ruleId for submitted) name description nrql enabled accountId Queries Query operations include: List all rules for a New Relic account You can list all rules in a New Relic account or return a specific rule. Example listing all rules for account 123456: query { actor { account(id:123456) { eventsToMetrics{ allRules{ rules{ id name enabled nrql description } } } } } } Copy In this request: Element Description query One of the basic API operation types. Used to query but not make changes. actor This specifies the current New Relic user. account(id: 123456) Specify the ID for the New Relic account where to retrieve data. eventsToMetrics Scope the data only for events-to-metrics, logs-to-metrics, or spans-to-metrics rules. allRules Returns all rules for that account. rules In the rules block, you can define what data you want returned. Available fields include: id name description nrql accountId enabled Example response: { \"data\": { \"actor\": { \"account\": { \"eventsToMetrics\": { \"allRules\": { \"rules\": [ { \"description\": \"Metric for total time\", \"enabled\": true, \"id\": \"1\", \"name\": \"Total Time Tx\", \"nrql\": \"select summary(totalTime) as 'server.totalTime' from Transaction where appName = 'Data Points Staging' facet name, appName, host\" }, { \"description\": \"Metric for duration\", \"enabled\": true, \"id\": \"2\", \"name\": \"Duration Rule\", \"nrql\": \"select summary(duration) as 'server.responseTime' from Transaction where appName = 'Data Points Staging' facet name, appName, host\" } ] } } } } } } Copy List rule by rule ID If you know the exact ID for a rule, then you can query for a specific rule. For example, you may have just created a rule and now you want to list its contents so you can review it. Example listing rule 36 for New Relic account 123456: query { actor { account(id: 123456) { eventsToMetrics { rulesById(ruleIds: \"36\") { rules { id name enabled nrql description accountId } } } } } } Copy For more details about the elements in this query, see List all rules. Example response: { \"data\": { \"actor\": { \"account\": { \"eventsToMetrics\": { \"rulesById\": { \"rules\": [ { \"accountId\": 123456, \"description\": \"Metric for total time\", \"enabled\": true, \"id\": \"36\", \"name\": \"Total Time Tx\", \"nrql\": \"select summary(totalTime) as 'server.totalTime' from Transaction where appName = 'Data Points Staging' facet name, appName, host\" } ] } } } } } } Copy Use the NerdGraph GraphiQL API tool You can use our GraphiQL tool to explore the data structure. You can also use it to build and run the operations to convert events, logs, and spans to metrics. To use this tool: Create the metrics operation's request with the required parameters. Go to api.newrelic.com/graphiql, and paste your query into the box. To execute the operation, press Play. Or, to get the cURL format, select Copy as cURL.) Validate the response in the response box. Optional: To verify that your rule-creation operation was performed successfully, run a list query for that rule ID.",

      "body": "Use New Relic's metrics API service to define rules for creating metrics from your other types of data, such as events, logs, or spans. Recommendation: Before you begin, review our requirements and tips for creating rules. Create a metrics rule To create a rule for creating metrics from events, logs, or spans: Construct the metrics rule using NRQL. Construct a NerdGraph (GraphQL format) API request that contains your NRQL rule. Create the metric by making the API request. Once a metric is created, you can query and chart it using NRQL. Step 1. Create NRQL query rule The most important part of creating a metrics rule is constructing the NRQL query that defines the metric for your data from events, logs, or spans. You can create up to 10 metrics with a single NRQL query by following this procedure: Using New Relic's NRQL interface, construct a query for the metric you want to create. For example: FROM ProcessSample SELECT average(ioTotalReadBytes) WHERE nr.entityType = 'HOST' Copy Edit the query to use one of the three available metric types: summary: Use if the query's function is min, max, sum, count, or average. uniqueCount: Use if the query's function is uniqueCount. distribution: Use if the query's function is percentile or histogram. This example query uses average, so use summary: FROM ProcessSample SELECT summary (ioTotalReadBytes) WHERE nr.entityType = 'HOST' Copy This example query uses count on a non-numeric field: FROM ProcessSample SELECT count(hostname) WHERE hostname LIKE '%prod%' Copy For summary on a non-numeric field use summary(1): FROM ProcessSample SELECT summary(1) WHERE hostname LIKE '%prod%' Copy Tip For more detailed information on using these metric types in rules, see Creating metric rules: requirements and tips. Decide on the attributes you want to attach to the metric, following the limits on the cardinality of unique metric-name/attribute-value combinations. Recommendation: Run a separate query to ensure this count isn't over 50,000 for a 24-hour window. For example: FROM ProcessSample SELECT uniqueCount(awsRegion, awsAvailabilityZone, commandName) WHERE nr.entityType = 'HOST' SINCE 1 DAY AGO Copy To be able to aggregate and filter your metrics, add the attributes you want to attach to the metric using the FACET clause. For example: FROM ProcessSample SELECT summary(ioTotalReadBytes) WHERE nr.entityType = 'HOST' FACET awsRegion, awsAvailabilityZone, commandName Copy Set the name of the metric using the AS function. For example: FROM ProcessSample SELECT summary(ioTotalReadBytes) AS 'io.totalread.bytes' WHERE nr.entityType = 'HOST' FACET awsRegion, awsAvailabilityZone, commandName Copy Once your NRQL rule is complete, use it to create the API request. Step 2. Create API request After you build the NRQL rule to convert data from events, logs, or spans to metrics, continue with building the API request. You can use our NerdGraph API tool to explore the data structure and to construct and make your request. To check that the rule was created correctly, you can run a query to return that rule using its ID. For tips on querying the metrics you've created, see Query and chart your metrics. Example NerdGraph API request The following example NerdGraph API request uses the same NRQL rule from step 1. The IO Total Read Bytes Rule creates a metric named io.totalread.bytes. (The rule name can have spaces, which differs from the metric naming rules.) mutation { eventsToMetricsCreateRule(rules: { name: \"io.totalread.bytes for computeSample entities\", description:\"Created by Zach on March 27, 2019. Used by team Network.\", nrql:\"FROM ProcessSample SELECT summary(ioTotalReadBytes) AS 'io.totalread.bytes' WHERE nr.entityType = 'ComputeSample' FACET awsRegion, awsAvailabilityZone, commandName\", accountId: 123456 }) { successes { id name nrql enabled } failures { submitted { name nrql accountId } errors { reason description } } } } Copy In this request: Request elements Description mutation One of the basic API operation types. eventsToMetricsCreateRule The method being called to create a rule. rules Takes four parameters: name: The name of the rule. description: Optional. The description of the rule. We recommend you include information about who created the metric data and who will be using the data. accountId: The New Relic account ID where the events, logs, or spans live and the metrics will be created. nrql: The NRQL query that creates the rule. For more on this, see Create NRQL query. successes and submitted blocks Here you define the data returned by a successful or failed response. Available parameters for these blocks include: id (ruleId for submitted) name description nrql enabled (enabled/disabled status) accountId ruleId and accountId If a failure occurs, then the submitted ruleId and accountId will be returned along with the error reason and error description. Example NerdGraph API response Here's an example of a returned response: { \"data\": { \"eventsToMetricsCreateRule\": { \"failures\": [], \"successes\": [ { \"enabled\": true, \"id\": \"46\", \"name\": \"io.totalread.bytes for computeSample entities\", \"nrql\": \"FROM ProcessSample SELECT summary(ioTotalReadBytes) AS 'io.totalread.bytes' WHERE nr.entityType = 'ComputeSample' FACET awsRegion, awsAvailabilityZone, commandName\" } ] } } } Copy Step 3. Create a metrics rule with API request When your API request is ready, you can use the NerdGraph API to make the request, which will create the metrics. Query and chart your metrics After you create a metrics rule to convert data for your events, logs, or spans, you can view the new metric data in the New Relic UI. To view your data: Go to New Relic's NRQL query interface. Run the following query to see the name of all your metrics: SELECT uniques(metricName) FROM Metric Copy Pick the metric of interest, then run the following query to see the available attributes: SELECT * FROM Metric where metricName = 'yourMetric' Copy If you don't see expected data, follow the troubleshooting procedures. The available NRQL aggregator functions depend on the metric type you created. Here are some examples. Summary metric example If you created a summary metric type, you can use the count, sum, max, min, and average aggregator functions, as shown in the following query: SELECT count(appStartResponseTime), sum(appStartResponseTime), max(appStartResponseTime), min(appStartResponseTime), average(appStartResponseTime) FROM Metric Copy Count metric example If you created a uniqueCount metric type, you can only use the uniqueCount function, as shown in the following query: SELECT uniqueCount(playbackErrorStreamUniqueCount) * 100 / uniqueCount(streamUniqueCount) AS '% of Streams Impacted' FROM Metric Copy Distribution metric example If you created a distribution metric type, use the percentile or histogram functions, as shown in the following queries: SELECT percentile(service.responseTime, 95) FROM Metric Copy OR SELECT histogram(service.responseTime, 10, 20) FROM Metric Copy Troubleshooting If your NerdGraph call is not constructed correctly, you may receive a message like this: Cannot parse the unexpected character \"\\u201C” Copy Verify the quotes in the NerdGraph call are not smart quotes (curly quotes). Our NerdGraph API only accepts straight quotes.",

Important This doc is for accounts on our New Relic One pricing plan. If you're on our original product-based pricing plan, see Original data retention. Not sure which you're on? See Overview of pricing and user model. The Data ingestion page shows your ingest rates for a period you specify on the top-right of the Data management hub.

You can toggle between an overall ingest view and an account view to identify which of your accounts are sending the most data. The page also provides the current month-to-date, and the projected end-of-month total ingest rates.

Billable data sources Description Timeslices (1-minute) and Metric:Raw Metrics are timeslices + MetricRaw Metric group: MetricsBytes Metric timeslice data averages to one-hour periods after eight days. After 90 days, the permanent metric data continues to be stored in one-hour periods. We currently store the raw metric data for 30 days. You are only billed for the initial ingest volume. You are not billed for subsequent rollups. APM (transactions and errors) APM events Metric group: ApmEventsBytes InfraSamples:Raw Includes multiple Infrastructure events Infrastructure host data Metric group:InfraHostBytes Information related to your servers and virtual machines coming from infrastructure agents, including storage and network data Infrastructure process data stored in ProcessSample. Metric group: InfraProcessBytes Data are metrics related to each process running on the hosts running the Infrastructure agent. This feature is turned off by default. Infrastructure integrations Metric group: InfraIntegrationBytes Performance data related to applications and services, typically managed by the customer, including data related to Docker containers, Windows services, Nagios checks, and cloud integrations such as managed services in AWS, Azure, and GCP. Logging Includes logs and LogExtendedRecord Metric group: LoggingBytes Log messages longer than 4KB are split into multiple events that, when needed, are stitched together to display the original message; this reduces the size of message data. Default Custom events Metric group: CustomEventsBytes Mobile error Mobile general Breadcrumb crash event trails Mobile session Mobile exception Mobile crash Mobile events Metric group: MobileEventsBytes Tracing Metric group: TracingBytes TracingBytes includes Span and OpenTelemetry's SpanEvent. You are not charged for DistributedTraceSummary events. Browser:EventLog Browser Browser:JSErrors PcvPerf (PageView timing) Browser events Metric group: BrowserEventsBytes Lambda Serverless Metric group: ServerlessBytes Break down data to see what's contributing to your ingest You can inspect your data ingest to gain more information about your ingest health. This way, you'll know your baselines, and can more easily spot an anomaly like an ingest spike, as well as its source. To break down your ingested data, start from the chart on the Data ingestion page. Think of the data source bands as the Y axis, and the dates as the X axis. Click on the band you want to inspect at the spot in the X axis that corresponds with the date you want to investigate. This image shows the Metrics band for June 15 right before it's clicked. A modal opens with the account, data source, and facet selected. You can do a handful of things on this page: Change the account, data source, or facet you want to drill down into. Change the date and time to investigate. Review the results of the query in chart form. The chart displays the top 15 results for the facet query. Open the NRQL query in the Query builder where you'll find additional facets that you can use. Learn more about NRQL queries here. How we break your ingest data down Some of the content in the UI is variable, depending on your account. This information is intended to help you understand how we're working with your ingest data. The chart on the Data ingestion page shows data usage for a little longer time frame than that covered by your retention settings for each data ingest source. If you choose a date outside of your designated retention period for an ingest source, you'll get the message that there's no chart data available. Select a more recent date to fix this problem. If you inspect a data source for an account that has less than a terrabyte of data, we compute the ingest volume over a 24 hour period; otherwise, we compute it for a 1 hour period. The ingest value provided on the main Data ingestion chart will be slightly different from that reflected during inspection. This is because our facet computation is an estimate. Set alerts for data use Query and alert on usage data describes how to set alerts to get notified if you're nearing data ingest limits you don't want to cross. For example, you might set an alert on logs, which can stack up quickly in an active system. Adjust your data ingest Drop data for lower retention costs and data compliance On ingest, we apply data dropping rules so you won't be charged for data that's not useful. Learn how to set additional data dropping rules yourself. Use NerdGraph to drop entire data types or drop data attributes from data types so they’re not written to NRDB. This enables you to focus on the data you want, reduces retention costs, and avoids writing sensitive data to the database. For dropping log data, see Drop data with drop filter rules. Turn off agents and integrations If you don’t need data from specific agents or integrations that you have installed, you can uninstall/delete those tools. For instructions, see the specific documentation for an agent or integration.",

For complete attribute values, use the JSON chart type or Query API. Naming syntax Attribute names can be a combination of alphanumeric characters, colons (:), periods (.), and underscores (_). Event types (using the eventType attribute) can be a combination of alphanumeric characters, colons (:), and underscores (_). Do not use words reserved for use by NRQL. Null values The database does not store any data with a null value. Reserved words Avoid using the following reserved words as names for events and attributes. Otherwise, unexpected results may occur. Important This is not a complete list. In general, avoid using MySQL-reserved words to avoid collision with future New Relic functionality. Keyword Description accountId This is a reserved attribute name. If it's included, it will be dropped during ingest. appId Value must be an integer. If it is not an integer, the attribute name and value will be dropped during ingest. eventType The event type as stored in New Relic. New Relic agents and scripts normally report this as eventType. Can be a combination of alphanumeric characters, colons (:), and underscores (_). Be sure to review the prohibited eventType values and eventType limits. Prohibited eventType values For your eventType value, avoid using: Metric, MetricRaw, and strings prefixed with Metric[0-9] (such as Metric2 or Metric1Minute). Public_ and strings prefixed with Public_. These event types are reserved for use by New Relic. Events passed in with these eventType values will be dropped. timestamp Must be a Unix epoch timestamp. You can define timestamps either in seconds or in milliseconds. It must be +/-1 day (24 hours) of the current time on the server. Log forwarding terms The following keys are reserved by the Infrastructure agent's log forwarding feature: entity.guid, log, hostname, plugin.type, fb.input. If used, they are dropped during ingest and a warning is added to the logs. NRQL syntax terms If you need to use NRQL syntax terms as attribute names, including dotted attributes, they must be enclosed in backticks; for example, `LIMIT` or `consumer.offset`. Otherwise, avoid using these reserved words: ago, and, as, auto, begin, begintime, compare, day, days, end, endtime, explain, facet, from, hour, hours, in, is, like, limit, minute, minutes, month, months, not, null, offset, or, raw, second, seconds, select, since, timeseries, until, week, weeks, where, with Event type limits The current limit for total number of eventType values is 250 per child account in a given 24-hour time period.

      "body": "You can use browser monitoring in New Relic to add custom events and attributes. Page actions and views Use the browser API's addPageAction call to capture events, actions, route changes, or any end-user interactions with your application. The addPageAction call adds an event named PageAction that contains the action name and any custom attribute names and values you capture along with it. The PageAction event also contains any custom attributes you added to the PageView event. Add custom attributes to the PageView event so you can query or filter your data to answer more questions about your application. Prerequisites In order to report PageAction events, verify these prerequisites: Requirement Comments Agent version Your browser monitoring agent version must be 593 or higher. Client browser version To record PageAction events, the browser must support cross-domain XHRs. Max events per cycle PageAction events are reported every 30 seconds, with a maximum of 120 events per 30-second harvest cycle, per browser. After the 120-event limit is reached, additional events are not captured for that cycle. Event/attribute naming, data type, size Ensure you follow general requirements around event/attribute naming syntax, data types, and size. Create PageAction events To create a PageAction event: Ensure the browser agent is installed for your app. Call the newrelic.addPageAction function in the relevant part of your application's JavaScript. Wait a couple minutes for the application to run and report relevant PageAction events. Run a NRQL query of the PageAction event that includes the actionName attribute you used to capture the event (and any associated attributes you sent along with the action). Add custom attributes to PageView event The PageView event is a default browser-reported event. You can add custom attributes to the PageView event. Any custom attributes you add to the PageView event are also automatically added to the PageAction event. There are two ways to add custom attributes to the PageView event: Use setCustomAttribute browser API call To add a custom attribute to the PageView event via the browser agent, use the setCustomAttribute browser API call. This allows you to capture an attribute to be annotated on any PageAction event. Forward custom attributes from APM data If you added custom attributes to the APM Transaction event via an APM agent, you can forward those custom attributes to the PageView event automatically: Insert custom attributes by following the agent-specific instructions. Enable attribute forwarding in your agent configuration file: Agent Enable attribute forwarding C SDK Not supported. Go To enable attributes, add this to your config (disabled by default): cfg.BrowserMonitoring.Attributes.Enabled = true Copy Then add the attributes you want to include: cfg.BrowserMonitoring.Attributes.Include = []string{\"request.*\"} Copy Java Add the attributes.enabled option in the browser_monitoring stanza and set it to true. .NET Add the <attributes enabled=\"true\"> element as a child of the browserMonitoring element: <configuration xmlns=\"urn:newrelic-config\"> ... <browserMonitoring autoInstrument=\"true\"> ... <attributes enabled=\"true\"> ... </attributes> </browserMonitoring> ... </configuration> Copy If you are using manual browser instrumentation the attribute needs to be created before the GetBrowserTimingHeader() call. Node.js Add attributes: {enabled: true} to the browser_monitoring: { section of your app's newrelicjs configuration file. PHP Add the newrelic.browser_monitoring.attributes.enabled option and set it to true. Python Add the browser_monitoring.attributes.enabled option and set it to true. Ruby Add the browser_monitoring.attributes.enabled option and set it to true. PageAction and PageView attributes To see the default attributes of PageAction and PageView, see Browser events. Troubleshooting Here are some troubleshooting tips: Problem Comments Custom attributes missing If your custom attributes do not appear on PageView events, verify you are calling setCustomAttribute before the Load event on your page. If the custom attribute is called after the page load occurs, it will not be visible on PageView. PageAction events If your PageAction events do not appear when you query, check that your account is compatible. If your account is compatible, check that you are not using reserved attribute names or invalid values.",

      "body": "Mobile monitoring in New Relic sends some default event data from your mobile app to New Relic, such as data about interactions, sessions, crashes, and request errors. You can also create your own custom attributes and events for more detailed querying and analysis. Create custom attributes and events You can create custom session-level attributes for default mobile monitoring events using the mobile agent SDKs. For example, to record a username attribute for some part of your iOS or Android app, you would use the setAttribute API (Android | iOS). These attributes are session-related information and are shared by multiple mobile event types. You can also create entirely new custom event types and assign them their own custom attributes, using the recordCustomEvent API (Android | iOS). To help with crash analysis, you can use the SDK to create MobileBreadcrumb and MobileHandledException events. These events are available for querying and also displayed in the crash event trail UI. For more on creating custom attributes and custom events, see: Android SDK API guide iOS SDK API guide NRQL query examples MobileRequestError examples MobileRequest examples Limits and restricted characters Mobile event and attribute query examples Here are some examples of using NRQL to query your mobile app events and attributes: Custom event example: Track purchases To track purchases in your app, use recordCustomEvent to create an event type (such as \"UserAction\") and associate attributes such as \"name\" (with value \"Purchase\"), price, quantity, and SKU. Tip For performance reasons, you should limit the total number of event types to maybe one or two. The recordCustomEvent parameter eventType is meant to be used for high-level categories. For example, you might create an event typeGestures, and then create many different custom event names under the Gesture event type. Create an event on iOS: BOOL purchaseRecorded = [NewRelic recordCustomEvent:@\"UserAction\" attributes:@{@\"name\": @\"Purchase\", @\"sku\": @\"12345LPD\", @\"quantity\": @1, @\"unitPrice\": @99.99, @\"total\": @99.99}]; Copy Create an event on Android: Map<String, Object> userActionAttributes = new HashMap<String, Object>(); userActionAttributes.put(\"name\", \"Purchase\"); userActionAttributes.put(\"sku\", \"12345LPD\"); userActionAttributes.put(\"quantity\", 1); userActionAttributes.put(\"unitPrice\", 99.99); userActionAttributes.put(\"total\", 99.99); boolean userActionRecorded = NewRelic.recordCustomEvent(\"UserAction\", userActionAttributes); Copy New Relic reports a custom event of type UserAction and name Purchase, which allows you to query all purchases made in your app in the last day: SELECT * from UserAction where name = 'Purchase' since 1 day ago Copy Replace deprecated recordEvent method: As of Android agent version 5.12.0 and iOS agent version 5.12.0, use the recordCustomEvent method to create these custom events. If you have replaced the deprecated recordEvent method for your custom events, be sure to also replace its corresponding NRQL query with the new format. Look for queries used with recordEvent method, such as this: SELECT * from Mobile where category = 'Custom' and name = 'Purchase' since 1 day ago Copy Replace them with the query format used with recordCustomEvent: SELECT * from UserAction where name = 'Purchase' since 1 day ago Copy Attribute example: Track a specific user You can create a custom attribute to track a custom user identifier across the session, and then query for all that user's interactions. To add an attribute for the userId, call the setUserId method: Set the userId on iOS: BOOL userIdWasSet = [NewRelic setUserId:@\"jsmith\"]; Copy Set the userId on Android: boolean userIdWasSet = NewRelic.setUserId(\"jsmith\"); Copy With this attribute, you can use a WHERE clause to see all actions performed by that username in the last day: SELECT * from Mobile WHERE userId = 'jsmith' since 1 day ago Copy Attribute example: Track a specific store id You can create a custom attribute to track a store id across the session, and then query for all that store's interactions. To add an attribute for the storeId, call the setAttribute method: Set the storeId on iOS: BOOL attributeSet = [NewRelic setAttribute:@\"storeId\" value:@\"NY0531\"]; Copy Set the storeId on Android: boolean attributeSet = NewRelic.setAttribute(\"storeId\", \"NY0531\"); Copy With this attribute, you can use a WHERE clause to see all actions performed by that storeId in the last day: SELECT * from Mobile WHERE storeId = 'NY0531' since 1 day ago Copy Custom attribute example: Track a specific action You can use custom attributes to track the number of times that a specific action occurs in your application. For example, you can track the number of times a button was clicked or the number of times a level was completed in a game. To track completing a game level, call incrementAttribute with no value specified. This creates an attribute with a default value of 1: Create a counter on iOS: BOOL levelIncremented = [NewRelic incrementAttribute@\"level\"]; Copy Create a counter on Android: boolean levelIncremented = NewRelic.incrementAttribute(\"level\"); Copy Each subsequent call to incrementAttribute adds 1 to the attribute level: Increment a counter on iOS: levelIncremented = [NewRelic incrementAttribute@\"level\"]; Copy Increment a counter on Android: levelIncremented = NewRelic.incrementAttribute(\"level\"); Copy Important Be sure to reset the value to 0 when starting over. To reset the level back to 1 or 0, call setAttribute: Reset a counter on iOS: levelReset = [NewRelic setAttribute:@\"level\" value:@1]; Copy Reset a counter on Android: levelReset = NewRelic.setAttribute(\"level\", 1); Copy When querying, use this level attribute to filter your data. For example, if you have a username and level attribute, use the max() function to find the highest level the user had reached: SELECT max(level) from Mobile where username = 'jsmith' Copy Size limits and restricted characters Limits for custom attributes added to default mobile events: Attributes: 128 maximum String attributes: 4 KB maximum length (empty string values are not accepted) Limits for custom events: Attributes: 254 maximum per event (number includes default session attributes) String attributes: 4 KB maximum length (empty string values are not accepted) Naming syntax and rules: See Rules for custom data. Set the time to send data By default, New Relic transmits event data in any of these situations: A session has been ongoing for 600 seconds. The app session ends by backgrounding. The app crashes. If the app crashes, New Relic gathers the attributes and events for that session and sends them to Insights. (On iOS, this happens the next time the app is launched). You can then use Insights to query and analyze the event and attribute data. To set the maximum time (in seconds) that the agent will store events in memory, use the following SDK calls: iOS method: + (void) setMaxEventBufferTime:(unsigned int)seconds; Copy Android method: public static void setMaxEventBufferTime(int maxBufferTimeInSec); Copy Privacy considerations If you want to collect personal data via custom attributes, please consult with your privacy or legal teams.

      "body": "If you have APM, you can report custom event data. You can then query and visualize your data in New Relic. Data considerations New Relic agents send event data to New Relic as part of the normal harvest cycle every five seconds for agent versions supporting real time streaming. Sending a lot of events can increase the memory overhead of the agent. New Relic enforces an upper limit of 833 custom events every 5 seconds. Additionally, posts greater than 1MB (10^6 bytes) in size will not be recorded, regardless of the custom event limit. You can also send custom events using the Event API (without need for APM). However, be aware that custom events sent with the agent APIs are not compatible with high security mode. Tip For more information, check out New Relic University’s tutorial Adding custom data with the APM agent API. Or, go directly to the full online course Custom data with APM. Record custom events and attributes You can add your own custom APM events and attributes, which you can then use for querying and charting. This is one of several ways to report custom data. To record a custom event, follow the procedures for your New Relic language agent. To add custom attributes to APM events, you must first enable them for your APM agent, and then make an API call to record the attribute. Follow the agent-specific custom attribute procedures. When creating your own custom events and attributes, follow data requirements for: Size limits Attribute types Reserved words C SDK To add a custom event to apps monitored by the C SDK, start a transaction and use the newrelic_create_custom_event and newrelic_record_custom_event functions. For more information, see the Guide to using the C SDK API. You can then add custom attributes for your C SDK app. Go To add a custom event to apps monitored by the Go agent, use RecordCustomEvent. You can then add custom attributes for your Go app. Java Custom event collection is enabled by default in Java agent version 3.13.0 or higher. To send custom events, call recordCustomEvent. For example: Map<String, Object> eventAttributes = new HashMap<String, Object>(); NewRelic.getAgent().getInsights().recordCustomEvent(\"MyCustomEvent\", eventAttributes); Copy The first argument defines the name of your event type, and the second argument is a map with the attributes for your custom event. Event attributes must be strings or numbers. Ensure you limit the number of unique event type names that you create, and do not generate these names dynamically. For restrictions on event type names, see our documentation about limits and restricted characters and NRQL reserved words. You can change the maximum number of events recorded by the Java agent via a configuration parameter in newrelic.yml. Specify the maximum number of events to record per minute as an integer. For example, if you want to send less than the default of 10000 events: custom_insights_events: max_samples_stored: 5000 Copy To disable custom events entirely, add the following to your newrelic.yml: custom_insights_events: enabled: false Copy You can then add custom attributes for your Java app. For Java agent versions prior to 4.1.0, use the following YAML configuration: custom_insights_events.enabled: true custom_insights_events.max_samples_stored: 5000 Copy .NET Custom event collection is enabled by default in .NET agent version 4.6.29.0 or higher. To send custom events, simply call RecordCustomEvent(). For example: var eventAttributes = new Dictionary<String, Object>(); NewRelic.Api.Agent.NewRelic.RecordCustomEvent('MyCustomEvent', eventAttributes); Copy The first argument defines the name of your event type, and the second argument is an IEnumerable with the attributes for your custom event. Ensure you limit the number of unique event type names that you create, and do not generate these names dynamically. For restrictions on event type names, see our documentation about limits and restricted characters and NRQL reserved words. You can then add custom attributes for your .NET app. You can turn off custom events entirely by setting customEvents.enabled to false in newrelic.config. Node.js Custom event collection is enabled by default in Node.js agent version 1.15.0 or higher. To send custom events, simply call the relevant API. For example: recordCustomEvent(eventType, attributes) Copy Use recordCustomEvent to record an event-based metric, usually associated with a particular duration. The eventType must be an alphanumeric string less than 255 characters. The attributes must be an object of key and value pairs. The keys must be shorter than 255 characters, and the values must be string, number, or boolean. For restrictions on event type names, see our documentation about limits and restricted characters and NRQL reserved words. You can then add custom attributes for your Node.js app. To disable custom events entirely, add custom_insights_events.enabled: false to newrelic.js. PHP Custom event collection is enabled by default in PHP agent version 4.18 or higher. To send custom events, simply call the relevant API function. For example: newrelic_record_custom_event(\"WidgetSale\", array(\"color\"=>\"red\", \"weight\"=>12.5)); Copy The first argument defines the name of your event type, and the second argument is an array with the attributes for your custom event. Ensure you limit the number of unique event type names that you create, and do not generate these names dynamically. For restrictions on event type names, see our documentation about limits and restricted characters and NRQL reserved words. By default, the maximum number of custom events recorded per minute is 10,000. This setting cannot be changed. You can then add custom attributes for your PHP app. To disable custom events entirely, add newrelic.custom_insights_events.enabled = false to your newrelic.ini and restart the agent. Python Custom event collection is enabled by default in Python agent version 2.60.0.46 or higher. To send custom events, simply call the relevant API. For example: newrelic.agent. record_custom_event (event_type, params, application=None) Copy The event_type defines the name (or type) of the custom event. Attributes of the custom event should be passed in as a dictionary via the params keyword argument. Ensure you limit the number of unique event type names that you create, and do not generate these names dynamically. For limits and restrictions on event_type and params, see our documentation about limits and restricted characters and reserved words If called outside of the context of a monitored web request or background task, the call will be ignored unless the application keyword argument is provided and an application object corresponding to the application against which the exception should be recorded is provided. A suitable application object can be obtained using the newrelic.agent.application() function. You can then add custom attributes for your Python app. To disable custom events entirely, set custom_insights_events.enabled to False in your newrelic.ini configuration file. Ruby Custom event collection is enabled by default in Ruby agent version 3.9.8.273 or higher. To send custom events, simply call the relevant API. For example: ::NewRelic::Agent.record_custom_event('WidgetSale', color: 'red', weight: 12.5) Copy The first argument defines the name of your event type, and the second argument is a hash with the attributes for your custom event. Ensure you limit the number of unique event type names that you create, and do not generate these names dynamically. For restrictions on event type names, see our documentation about limits and restricted characters and NRQL reserved words. You can change the maximum number of events recorded by the Ruby agent via a configuration parameter in newrelic.yml: Add custom_insights_events.max_samples_stored: to your configuration file. Specify the maximum number of events to record per minute as an integer. For example, if you want to be able to send up to 5000 events per minute, add: custom_insights_events.max_samples_stored: 5000 Copy You can then add custom attributes for your Ruby app. To disable custom events entirely, add custom_insights_events.enabled: false to newrelic.yml. Timestamps You may not specify a timestamp on events that are collected and recorded via the agent. The agent will automatically assign a timestamp to events based on when they are recorded via the API. Limits and restricted characters See Custom event data requirements for size limits, data types, and naming syntax requirements. Reserved words Before creating custom attributes, review New Relic's list of reserved terms used by NRQL. Otherwise unexpected results may occur.",

      "body": "You can use browser monitoring in New Relic to add custom events and attributes. Page actions and views Use the browser API's addPageAction call to capture events, actions, route changes, or any end-user interactions with your application. The addPageAction call adds an event named PageAction that contains the action name and any custom attribute names and values you capture along with it. The PageAction event also contains any custom attributes you added to the PageView event. Add custom attributes to the PageView event so you can query or filter your data to answer more questions about your application. Prerequisites In order to report PageAction events, verify these prerequisites: Requirement Comments Agent version Your browser monitoring agent version must be 593 or higher. Client browser version To record PageAction events, the browser must support cross-domain XHRs. Max events per cycle PageAction events are reported every 30 seconds, with a maximum of 120 events per 30-second harvest cycle, per browser. After the 120-event limit is reached, additional events are not captured for that cycle. Event/attribute naming, data type, size Ensure you follow general requirements around event/attribute naming syntax, data types, and size. Create PageAction events To create a PageAction event: Ensure the browser agent is installed for your app. Call the newrelic.addPageAction function in the relevant part of your application's JavaScript. Wait a couple minutes for the application to run and report relevant PageAction events. Run a NRQL query of the PageAction event that includes the actionName attribute you used to capture the event (and any associated attributes you sent along with the action). Add custom attributes to PageView event The PageView event is a default browser-reported event. You can add custom attributes to the PageView event. Any custom attributes you add to the PageView event are also automatically added to the PageAction event. There are two ways to add custom attributes to the PageView event: Use setCustomAttribute browser API call To add a custom attribute to the PageView event via the browser agent, use the setCustomAttribute browser API call. This allows you to capture an attribute to be annotated on any PageAction event. Forward custom attributes from APM data If you added custom attributes to the APM Transaction event via an APM agent, you can forward those custom attributes to the PageView event automatically: Insert custom attributes by following the agent-specific instructions. Enable attribute forwarding in your agent configuration file: Agent Enable attribute forwarding C SDK Not supported. Go To enable attributes, add this to your config (disabled by default): cfg.BrowserMonitoring.Attributes.Enabled = true Copy Then add the attributes you want to include: cfg.BrowserMonitoring.Attributes.Include = []string{\"request.*\"} Copy Java Add the attributes.enabled option in the browser_monitoring stanza and set it to true. .NET Add the <attributes enabled=\"true\"> element as a child of the browserMonitoring element: <configuration xmlns=\"urn:newrelic-config\"> ... <browserMonitoring autoInstrument=\"true\"> ... <attributes enabled=\"true\"> ... </attributes> </browserMonitoring> ... </configuration> Copy If you are using manual browser instrumentation the attribute needs to be created before the GetBrowserTimingHeader() call. Node.js Add attributes: {enabled: true} to the browser_monitoring: { section of your app's newrelicjs configuration file. PHP Add the newrelic.browser_monitoring.attributes.enabled option and set it to true. Python Add the browser_monitoring.attributes.enabled option and set it to true. Ruby Add the browser_monitoring.attributes.enabled option and set it to true. PageAction and PageView attributes To see the default attributes of PageAction and PageView, see Browser events. Troubleshooting Here are some troubleshooting tips: Problem Comments Custom attributes missing If your custom attributes do not appear on PageView events, verify you are calling setCustomAttribute before the Load event on your page. If the custom attribute is called after the page load occurs, it will not be visible on PageView. PageAction events If your PageAction events do not appear when you query, check that your account is compatible. If your account is compatible, check that you are not using reserved attribute names or invalid values.",

      "body": "Mobile monitoring in New Relic sends some default event data from your mobile app to New Relic, such as data about interactions, sessions, crashes, and request errors. You can also create your own custom attributes and events for more detailed querying and analysis. Create custom attributes and events You can create custom session-level attributes for default mobile monitoring events using the mobile agent SDKs. For example, to record a username attribute for some part of your iOS or Android app, you would use the setAttribute API (Android | iOS). These attributes are session-related information and are shared by multiple mobile event types. You can also create entirely new custom event types and assign them their own custom attributes, using the recordCustomEvent API (Android | iOS). To help with crash analysis, you can use the SDK to create MobileBreadcrumb and MobileHandledException events. These events are available for querying and also displayed in the crash event trail UI. For more on creating custom attributes and custom events, see: Android SDK API guide iOS SDK API guide NRQL query examples MobileRequestError examples MobileRequest examples Limits and restricted characters Mobile event and attribute query examples Here are some examples of using NRQL to query your mobile app events and attributes: Custom event example: Track purchases To track purchases in your app, use recordCustomEvent to create an event type (such as \"UserAction\") and associate attributes such as \"name\" (with value \"Purchase\"), price, quantity, and SKU. Tip For performance reasons, you should limit the total number of event types to maybe one or two. The recordCustomEvent parameter eventType is meant to be used for high-level categories. For example, you might create an event typeGestures, and then create many different custom event names under the Gesture event type. Create an event on iOS: BOOL purchaseRecorded = [NewRelic recordCustomEvent:@\"UserAction\" attributes:@{@\"name\": @\"Purchase\", @\"sku\": @\"12345LPD\", @\"quantity\": @1, @\"unitPrice\": @99.99, @\"total\": @99.99}]; Copy Create an event on Android: Map<String, Object> userActionAttributes = new HashMap<String, Object>(); userActionAttributes.put(\"name\", \"Purchase\"); userActionAttributes.put(\"sku\", \"12345LPD\"); userActionAttributes.put(\"quantity\", 1); userActionAttributes.put(\"unitPrice\", 99.99); userActionAttributes.put(\"total\", 99.99); boolean userActionRecorded = NewRelic.recordCustomEvent(\"UserAction\", userActionAttributes); Copy New Relic reports a custom event of type UserAction and name Purchase, which allows you to query all purchases made in your app in the last day: SELECT * from UserAction where name = 'Purchase' since 1 day ago Copy Replace deprecated recordEvent method: As of Android agent version 5.12.0 and iOS agent version 5.12.0, use the recordCustomEvent method to create these custom events. If you have replaced the deprecated recordEvent method for your custom events, be sure to also replace its corresponding NRQL query with the new format. Look for queries used with recordEvent method, such as this: SELECT * from Mobile where category = 'Custom' and name = 'Purchase' since 1 day ago Copy Replace them with the query format used with recordCustomEvent: SELECT * from UserAction where name = 'Purchase' since 1 day ago Copy Attribute example: Track a specific user You can create a custom attribute to track a custom user identifier across the session, and then query for all that user's interactions. To add an attribute for the userId, call the setUserId method: Set the userId on iOS: BOOL userIdWasSet = [NewRelic setUserId:@\"jsmith\"]; Copy Set the userId on Android: boolean userIdWasSet = NewRelic.setUserId(\"jsmith\"); Copy With this attribute, you can use a WHERE clause to see all actions performed by that username in the last day: SELECT * from Mobile WHERE userId = 'jsmith' since 1 day ago Copy Attribute example: Track a specific store id You can create a custom attribute to track a store id across the session, and then query for all that store's interactions. To add an attribute for the storeId, call the setAttribute method: Set the storeId on iOS: BOOL attributeSet = [NewRelic setAttribute:@\"storeId\" value:@\"NY0531\"]; Copy Set the storeId on Android: boolean attributeSet = NewRelic.setAttribute(\"storeId\", \"NY0531\"); Copy With this attribute, you can use a WHERE clause to see all actions performed by that storeId in the last day: SELECT * from Mobile WHERE storeId = 'NY0531' since 1 day ago Copy Custom attribute example: Track a specific action You can use custom attributes to track the number of times that a specific action occurs in your application. For example, you can track the number of times a button was clicked or the number of times a level was completed in a game. To track completing a game level, call incrementAttribute with no value specified. This creates an attribute with a default value of 1: Create a counter on iOS: BOOL levelIncremented = [NewRelic incrementAttribute@\"level\"]; Copy Create a counter on Android: boolean levelIncremented = NewRelic.incrementAttribute(\"level\"); Copy Each subsequent call to incrementAttribute adds 1 to the attribute level: Increment a counter on iOS: levelIncremented = [NewRelic incrementAttribute@\"level\"]; Copy Increment a counter on Android: levelIncremented = NewRelic.incrementAttribute(\"level\"); Copy Important Be sure to reset the value to 0 when starting over. To reset the level back to 1 or 0, call setAttribute: Reset a counter on iOS: levelReset = [NewRelic setAttribute:@\"level\" value:@1]; Copy Reset a counter on Android: levelReset = NewRelic.setAttribute(\"level\", 1); Copy When querying, use this level attribute to filter your data. For example, if you have a username and level attribute, use the max() function to find the highest level the user had reached: SELECT max(level) from Mobile where username = 'jsmith' Copy Size limits and restricted characters Limits for custom attributes added to default mobile events: Attributes: 128 maximum String attributes: 4 KB maximum length (empty string values are not accepted) Limits for custom events: Attributes: 254 maximum per event (number includes default session attributes) String attributes: 4 KB maximum length (empty string values are not accepted) Naming syntax and rules: See Rules for custom data. Set the time to send data By default, New Relic transmits event data in any of these situations: A session has been ongoing for 600 seconds. The app session ends by backgrounding. The app crashes. If the app crashes, New Relic gathers the attributes and events for that session and sends them to Insights. (On iOS, this happens the next time the app is launched). You can then use Insights to query and analyze the event and attribute data. To set the maximum time (in seconds) that the agent will store events in memory, use the following SDK calls: iOS method: + (void) setMaxEventBufferTime:(unsigned int)seconds; Copy Android method: public static void setMaxEventBufferTime(int maxBufferTimeInSec); Copy Privacy considerations If you want to collect personal data via custom attributes, please consult with your privacy or legal teams.

      "body": "If you have APM, you can report custom event data. You can then query and visualize your data in New Relic. Data considerations New Relic agents send event data to New Relic as part of the normal harvest cycle every five seconds for agent versions supporting real time streaming. Sending a lot of events can increase the memory overhead of the agent. New Relic enforces an upper limit of 833 custom events every 5 seconds. Additionally, posts greater than 1MB (10^6 bytes) in size will not be recorded, regardless of the custom event limit. You can also send custom events using the Event API (without need for APM). However, be aware that custom events sent with the agent APIs are not compatible with high security mode. Tip For more information, check out New Relic University’s tutorial Adding custom data with the APM agent API. Or, go directly to the full online course Custom data with APM. Record custom events and attributes You can add your own custom APM events and attributes, which you can then use for querying and charting. This is one of several ways to report custom data. To record a custom event, follow the procedures for your New Relic language agent. To add custom attributes to APM events, you must first enable them for your APM agent, and then make an API call to record the attribute. Follow the agent-specific custom attribute procedures. When creating your own custom events and attributes, follow data requirements for: Size limits Attribute types Reserved words C SDK To add a custom event to apps monitored by the C SDK, start a transaction and use the newrelic_create_custom_event and newrelic_record_custom_event functions. For more information, see the Guide to using the C SDK API. You can then add custom attributes for your C SDK app. Go To add a custom event to apps monitored by the Go agent, use RecordCustomEvent. You can then add custom attributes for your Go app. Java Custom event collection is enabled by default in Java agent version 3.13.0 or higher. To send custom events, call recordCustomEvent. For example: Map<String, Object> eventAttributes = new HashMap<String, Object>(); NewRelic.getAgent().getInsights().recordCustomEvent(\"MyCustomEvent\", eventAttributes); Copy The first argument defines the name of your event type, and the second argument is a map with the attributes for your custom event. Event attributes must be strings or numbers. Ensure you limit the number of unique event type names that you create, and do not generate these names dynamically. For restrictions on event type names, see our documentation about limits and restricted characters and NRQL reserved words. You can change the maximum number of events recorded by the Java agent via a configuration parameter in newrelic.yml. Specify the maximum number of events to record per minute as an integer. For example, if you want to send less than the default of 10000 events: custom_insights_events: max_samples_stored: 5000 Copy To disable custom events entirely, add the following to your newrelic.yml: custom_insights_events: enabled: false Copy You can then add custom attributes for your Java app. For Java agent versions prior to 4.1.0, use the following YAML configuration: custom_insights_events.enabled: true custom_insights_events.max_samples_stored: 5000 Copy .NET Custom event collection is enabled by default in .NET agent version 4.6.29.0 or higher. To send custom events, simply call RecordCustomEvent(). For example: var eventAttributes = new Dictionary<String, Object>(); NewRelic.Api.Agent.NewRelic.RecordCustomEvent('MyCustomEvent', eventAttributes); Copy The first argument defines the name of your event type, and the second argument is an IEnumerable with the attributes for your custom event. Ensure you limit the number of unique event type names that you create, and do not generate these names dynamically. For restrictions on event type names, see our documentation about limits and restricted characters and NRQL reserved words. You can then add custom attributes for your .NET app. You can turn off custom events entirely by setting customEvents.enabled to false in newrelic.config. Node.js Custom event collection is enabled by default in Node.js agent version 1.15.0 or higher. To send custom events, simply call the relevant API. For example: recordCustomEvent(eventType, attributes) Copy Use recordCustomEvent to record an event-based metric, usually associated with a particular duration. The eventType must be an alphanumeric string less than 255 characters. The attributes must be an object of key and value pairs. The keys must be shorter than 255 characters, and the values must be string, number, or boolean. For restrictions on event type names, see our documentation about limits and restricted characters and NRQL reserved words. You can then add custom attributes for your Node.js app. To disable custom events entirely, add custom_insights_events.enabled: false to newrelic.js. PHP Custom event collection is enabled by default in PHP agent version 4.18 or higher. To send custom events, simply call the relevant API function. For example: newrelic_record_custom_event(\"WidgetSale\", array(\"color\"=>\"red\", \"weight\"=>12.5)); Copy The first argument defines the name of your event type, and the second argument is an array with the attributes for your custom event. Ensure you limit the number of unique event type names that you create, and do not generate these names dynamically. For restrictions on event type names, see our documentation about limits and restricted characters and NRQL reserved words. By default, the maximum number of custom events recorded per minute is 10,000. This setting cannot be changed. You can then add custom attributes for your PHP app. To disable custom events entirely, add newrelic.custom_insights_events.enabled = false to your newrelic.ini and restart the agent. Python Custom event collection is enabled by default in Python agent version 2.60.0.46 or higher. To send custom events, simply call the relevant API. For example: newrelic.agent. record_custom_event (event_type, params, application=None) Copy The event_type defines the name (or type) of the custom event. Attributes of the custom event should be passed in as a dictionary via the params keyword argument. Ensure you limit the number of unique event type names that you create, and do not generate these names dynamically. For limits and restrictions on event_type and params, see our documentation about limits and restricted characters and reserved words If called outside of the context of a monitored web request or background task, the call will be ignored unless the application keyword argument is provided and an application object corresponding to the application against which the exception should be recorded is provided. A suitable application object can be obtained using the newrelic.agent.application() function. You can then add custom attributes for your Python app. To disable custom events entirely, set custom_insights_events.enabled to False in your newrelic.ini configuration file. Ruby Custom event collection is enabled by default in Ruby agent version 3.9.8.273 or higher. To send custom events, simply call the relevant API. For example: ::NewRelic::Agent.record_custom_event('WidgetSale', color: 'red', weight: 12.5) Copy The first argument defines the name of your event type, and the second argument is a hash with the attributes for your custom event. Ensure you limit the number of unique event type names that you create, and do not generate these names dynamically. For restrictions on event type names, see our documentation about limits and restricted characters and NRQL reserved words. You can change the maximum number of events recorded by the Ruby agent via a configuration parameter in newrelic.yml: Add custom_insights_events.max_samples_stored: to your configuration file. Specify the maximum number of events to record per minute as an integer. For example, if you want to be able to send up to 5000 events per minute, add: custom_insights_events.max_samples_stored: 5000 Copy You can then add custom attributes for your Ruby app. To disable custom events entirely, add custom_insights_events.enabled: false to newrelic.yml. Timestamps You may not specify a timestamp on events that are collected and recorded via the agent. The agent will automatically assign a timestamp to events based on when they are recorded via the API. Limits and restricted characters See Custom event data requirements for size limits, data types, and naming syntax requirements. Reserved words Before creating custom attributes, review New Relic's list of reserved terms used by NRQL. Otherwise unexpected results may occur.",

Exception: If you use an APM agent API, the max is 64. Maximum total attributes per event type: 48,000. Important Charts may only display the first 255 characters of attribute values. For complete attribute values, use the JSON chart type or Query API. Naming syntax Attribute names can be a combination of alphanumeric characters, colons (:), periods (.), and underscores (_). Event types (using the eventType attribute) can be a combination of alphanumeric characters, colons (:), and underscores (_). Do not use words reserved for use by NRQL. Null values The database does not store any data with a null value. Reserved words Avoid using the following reserved words as names for events and attributes. Otherwise, unexpected results may occur. Important This is not a complete list. In general, avoid using MySQL-reserved words to avoid collision with future New Relic functionality. Keyword Description accountId This is a reserved attribute name. If it's included, it will be dropped during ingest. appId Value must be an integer. If it is not an integer, the attribute name and value will be dropped during ingest. eventType The event type as stored in New Relic. New Relic agents and scripts normally report this as eventType. Can be a combination of alphanumeric characters, colons (:), and underscores (_). Be sure to review the prohibited eventType values and eventType limits. Prohibited eventType values For your eventType value, avoid using: Metric, MetricRaw, and strings prefixed with Metric[0-9] (such as Metric2 or Metric1Minute). Public_ and strings prefixed with Public_. These event types are reserved for use by New Relic. Events passed in with these eventType values will be dropped. timestamp Must be a Unix epoch timestamp. You can define timestamps either in seconds or in milliseconds. It must be +/-1 day (24 hours) of the current time on the server. Log forwarding terms The following keys are reserved by the Infrastructure agent's log forwarding feature: entity.guid, log, hostname, plugin.type, fb.input. If used, they are dropped during ingest and a warning is added to the logs. NRQL syntax terms If you need to use NRQL syntax terms as attribute names, including dotted attributes, they must be enclosed in backticks; for example, `LIMIT` or `consumer.offset`. Otherwise, avoid using these reserved words: ago, and, as, auto, begin, begintime, compare, day, days, end, endtime, explain, facet, from, hour, hours, in, is, like, limit, minute, minutes, month, months, not, null, offset, or, raw, second, seconds, select, since, timeseries, until, week, weeks, where, with Event type limits The current limit for total number of eventType values is 250 per child account in a given 24-hour time period. If a user exceeds this limit, New Relic may filter or drop data.

      "body": "Mobile monitoring in New Relic sends some default event data from your mobile app to New Relic, such as data about interactions, sessions, crashes, and request errors. You can also create your own custom attributes and events for more detailed querying and analysis. Create custom attributes and events You can create custom session-level attributes for default mobile monitoring events using the mobile agent SDKs. For example, to record a username attribute for some part of your iOS or Android app, you would use the setAttribute API (Android | iOS). These attributes are session-related information and are shared by multiple mobile event types. You can also create entirely new custom event types and assign them their own custom attributes, using the recordCustomEvent API (Android | iOS). To help with crash analysis, you can use the SDK to create MobileBreadcrumb and MobileHandledException events. These events are available for querying and also displayed in the crash event trail UI. For more on creating custom attributes and custom events, see: Android SDK API guide iOS SDK API guide NRQL query examples MobileRequestError examples MobileRequest examples Limits and restricted characters Mobile event and attribute query examples Here are some examples of using NRQL to query your mobile app events and attributes: Custom event example: Track purchases To track purchases in your app, use recordCustomEvent to create an event type (such as \"UserAction\") and associate attributes such as \"name\" (with value \"Purchase\"), price, quantity, and SKU. Tip For performance reasons, you should limit the total number of event types to maybe one or two. The recordCustomEvent parameter eventType is meant to be used for high-level categories. For example, you might create an event typeGestures, and then create many different custom event names under the Gesture event type. Create an event on iOS: BOOL purchaseRecorded = [NewRelic recordCustomEvent:@\"UserAction\" attributes:@{@\"name\": @\"Purchase\", @\"sku\": @\"12345LPD\", @\"quantity\": @1, @\"unitPrice\": @99.99, @\"total\": @99.99}]; Copy Create an event on Android: Map<String, Object> userActionAttributes = new HashMap<String, Object>(); userActionAttributes.put(\"name\", \"Purchase\"); userActionAttributes.put(\"sku\", \"12345LPD\"); userActionAttributes.put(\"quantity\", 1); userActionAttributes.put(\"unitPrice\", 99.99); userActionAttributes.put(\"total\", 99.99); boolean userActionRecorded = NewRelic.recordCustomEvent(\"UserAction\", userActionAttributes); Copy New Relic reports a custom event of type UserAction and name Purchase, which allows you to query all purchases made in your app in the last day: SELECT * from UserAction where name = 'Purchase' since 1 day ago Copy Replace deprecated recordEvent method: As of Android agent version 5.12.0 and iOS agent version 5.12.0, use the recordCustomEvent method to create these custom events. If you have replaced the deprecated recordEvent method for your custom events, be sure to also replace its corresponding NRQL query with the new format. Look for queries used with recordEvent method, such as this: SELECT * from Mobile where category = 'Custom' and name = 'Purchase' since 1 day ago Copy Replace them with the query format used with recordCustomEvent: SELECT * from UserAction where name = 'Purchase' since 1 day ago Copy Attribute example: Track a specific user You can create a custom attribute to track a custom user identifier across the session, and then query for all that user's interactions. To add an attribute for the userId, call the setUserId method: Set the userId on iOS: BOOL userIdWasSet = [NewRelic setUserId:@\"jsmith\"]; Copy Set the userId on Android: boolean userIdWasSet = NewRelic.setUserId(\"jsmith\"); Copy With this attribute, you can use a WHERE clause to see all actions performed by that username in the last day: SELECT * from Mobile WHERE userId = 'jsmith' since 1 day ago Copy Attribute example: Track a specific store id You can create a custom attribute to track a store id across the session, and then query for all that store's interactions. To add an attribute for the storeId, call the setAttribute method: Set the storeId on iOS: BOOL attributeSet = [NewRelic setAttribute:@\"storeId\" value:@\"NY0531\"]; Copy Set the storeId on Android: boolean attributeSet = NewRelic.setAttribute(\"storeId\", \"NY0531\"); Copy With this attribute, you can use a WHERE clause to see all actions performed by that storeId in the last day: SELECT * from Mobile WHERE storeId = 'NY0531' since 1 day ago Copy Custom attribute example: Track a specific action You can use custom attributes to track the number of times that a specific action occurs in your application. For example, you can track the number of times a button was clicked or the number of times a level was completed in a game. To track completing a game level, call incrementAttribute with no value specified. This creates an attribute with a default value of 1: Create a counter on iOS: BOOL levelIncremented = [NewRelic incrementAttribute@\"level\"]; Copy Create a counter on Android: boolean levelIncremented = NewRelic.incrementAttribute(\"level\"); Copy Each subsequent call to incrementAttribute adds 1 to the attribute level: Increment a counter on iOS: levelIncremented = [NewRelic incrementAttribute@\"level\"]; Copy Increment a counter on Android: levelIncremented = NewRelic.incrementAttribute(\"level\"); Copy Important Be sure to reset the value to 0 when starting over. To reset the level back to 1 or 0, call setAttribute: Reset a counter on iOS: levelReset = [NewRelic setAttribute:@\"level\" value:@1]; Copy Reset a counter on Android: levelReset = NewRelic.setAttribute(\"level\", 1); Copy When querying, use this level attribute to filter your data. For example, if you have a username and level attribute, use the max() function to find the highest level the user had reached: SELECT max(level) from Mobile where username = 'jsmith' Copy Size limits and restricted characters Limits for custom attributes added to default mobile events: Attributes: 128 maximum String attributes: 4 KB maximum length (empty string values are not accepted) Limits for custom events: Attributes: 254 maximum per event (number includes default session attributes) String attributes: 4 KB maximum length (empty string values are not accepted) Naming syntax and rules: See Rules for custom data. Set the time to send data By default, New Relic transmits event data in any of these situations: A session has been ongoing for 600 seconds. The app session ends by backgrounding. The app crashes. If the app crashes, New Relic gathers the attributes and events for that session and sends them to Insights. (On iOS, this happens the next time the app is launched). You can then use Insights to query and analyze the event and attribute data. To set the maximum time (in seconds) that the agent will store events in memory, use the following SDK calls: iOS method: + (void) setMaxEventBufferTime:(unsigned int)seconds; Copy Android method: public static void setMaxEventBufferTime(int maxBufferTimeInSec); Copy Privacy considerations If you want to collect personal data via custom attributes, please consult with your privacy or legal teams.

      "body": "If you have APM, you can report custom event data. You can then query and visualize your data in New Relic. Data considerations New Relic agents send event data to New Relic as part of the normal harvest cycle every five seconds for agent versions supporting real time streaming. Sending a lot of events can increase the memory overhead of the agent. New Relic enforces an upper limit of 833 custom events every 5 seconds. Additionally, posts greater than 1MB (10^6 bytes) in size will not be recorded, regardless of the custom event limit. You can also send custom events using the Event API (without need for APM). However, be aware that custom events sent with the agent APIs are not compatible with high security mode. Tip For more information, check out New Relic University’s tutorial Adding custom data with the APM agent API. Or, go directly to the full online course Custom data with APM. Record custom events and attributes You can add your own custom APM events and attributes, which you can then use for querying and charting. This is one of several ways to report custom data. To record a custom event, follow the procedures for your New Relic language agent. To add custom attributes to APM events, you must first enable them for your APM agent, and then make an API call to record the attribute. Follow the agent-specific custom attribute procedures. When creating your own custom events and attributes, follow data requirements for: Size limits Attribute types Reserved words C SDK To add a custom event to apps monitored by the C SDK, start a transaction and use the newrelic_create_custom_event and newrelic_record_custom_event functions. For more information, see the Guide to using the C SDK API. You can then add custom attributes for your C SDK app. Go To add a custom event to apps monitored by the Go agent, use RecordCustomEvent. You can then add custom attributes for your Go app. Java Custom event collection is enabled by default in Java agent version 3.13.0 or higher. To send custom events, call recordCustomEvent. For example: Map<String, Object> eventAttributes = new HashMap<String, Object>(); NewRelic.getAgent().getInsights().recordCustomEvent(\"MyCustomEvent\", eventAttributes); Copy The first argument defines the name of your event type, and the second argument is a map with the attributes for your custom event. Event attributes must be strings or numbers. Ensure you limit the number of unique event type names that you create, and do not generate these names dynamically. For restrictions on event type names, see our documentation about limits and restricted characters and NRQL reserved words. You can change the maximum number of events recorded by the Java agent via a configuration parameter in newrelic.yml. Specify the maximum number of events to record per minute as an integer. For example, if you want to send less than the default of 10000 events: custom_insights_events: max_samples_stored: 5000 Copy To disable custom events entirely, add the following to your newrelic.yml: custom_insights_events: enabled: false Copy You can then add custom attributes for your Java app. For Java agent versions prior to 4.1.0, use the following YAML configuration: custom_insights_events.enabled: true custom_insights_events.max_samples_stored: 5000 Copy .NET Custom event collection is enabled by default in .NET agent version 4.6.29.0 or higher. To send custom events, simply call RecordCustomEvent(). For example: var eventAttributes = new Dictionary<String, Object>(); NewRelic.Api.Agent.NewRelic.RecordCustomEvent('MyCustomEvent', eventAttributes); Copy The first argument defines the name of your event type, and the second argument is an IEnumerable with the attributes for your custom event. Ensure you limit the number of unique event type names that you create, and do not generate these names dynamically. For restrictions on event type names, see our documentation about limits and restricted characters and NRQL reserved words. You can then add custom attributes for your .NET app. You can turn off custom events entirely by setting customEvents.enabled to false in newrelic.config. Node.js Custom event collection is enabled by default in Node.js agent version 1.15.0 or higher. To send custom events, simply call the relevant API. For example: recordCustomEvent(eventType, attributes) Copy Use recordCustomEvent to record an event-based metric, usually associated with a particular duration. The eventType must be an alphanumeric string less than 255 characters. The attributes must be an object of key and value pairs. The keys must be shorter than 255 characters, and the values must be string, number, or boolean. For restrictions on event type names, see our documentation about limits and restricted characters and NRQL reserved words. You can then add custom attributes for your Node.js app. To disable custom events entirely, add custom_insights_events.enabled: false to newrelic.js. PHP Custom event collection is enabled by default in PHP agent version 4.18 or higher. To send custom events, simply call the relevant API function. For example: newrelic_record_custom_event(\"WidgetSale\", array(\"color\"=>\"red\", \"weight\"=>12.5)); Copy The first argument defines the name of your event type, and the second argument is an array with the attributes for your custom event. Ensure you limit the number of unique event type names that you create, and do not generate these names dynamically. For restrictions on event type names, see our documentation about limits and restricted characters and NRQL reserved words. By default, the maximum number of custom events recorded per minute is 10,000. This setting cannot be changed. You can then add custom attributes for your PHP app. To disable custom events entirely, add newrelic.custom_insights_events.enabled = false to your newrelic.ini and restart the agent. Python Custom event collection is enabled by default in Python agent version 2.60.0.46 or higher. To send custom events, simply call the relevant API. For example: newrelic.agent. record_custom_event (event_type, params, application=None) Copy The event_type defines the name (or type) of the custom event. Attributes of the custom event should be passed in as a dictionary via the params keyword argument. Ensure you limit the number of unique event type names that you create, and do not generate these names dynamically. For limits and restrictions on event_type and params, see our documentation about limits and restricted characters and reserved words If called outside of the context of a monitored web request or background task, the call will be ignored unless the application keyword argument is provided and an application object corresponding to the application against which the exception should be recorded is provided. A suitable application object can be obtained using the newrelic.agent.application() function. You can then add custom attributes for your Python app. To disable custom events entirely, set custom_insights_events.enabled to False in your newrelic.ini configuration file. Ruby Custom event collection is enabled by default in Ruby agent version 3.9.8.273 or higher. To send custom events, simply call the relevant API. For example: ::NewRelic::Agent.record_custom_event('WidgetSale', color: 'red', weight: 12.5) Copy The first argument defines the name of your event type, and the second argument is a hash with the attributes for your custom event. Ensure you limit the number of unique event type names that you create, and do not generate these names dynamically. For restrictions on event type names, see our documentation about limits and restricted characters and NRQL reserved words. You can change the maximum number of events recorded by the Ruby agent via a configuration parameter in newrelic.yml: Add custom_insights_events.max_samples_stored: to your configuration file. Specify the maximum number of events to record per minute as an integer. For example, if you want to be able to send up to 5000 events per minute, add: custom_insights_events.max_samples_stored: 5000 Copy You can then add custom attributes for your Ruby app. To disable custom events entirely, add custom_insights_events.enabled: false to newrelic.yml. Timestamps You may not specify a timestamp on events that are collected and recorded via the agent. The agent will automatically assign a timestamp to events based on when they are recorded via the API. Limits and restricted characters See Custom event data requirements for size limits, data types, and naming syntax requirements. Reserved words Before creating custom attributes, review New Relic's list of reserved terms used by NRQL. Otherwise unexpected results may occur.",

This document contains the iOS SDK instrumentation requirements for: Objective C Swift For details about the available methods for custom attributes and events you can send to to New Relic Insights, see the iOS SDK API reference. You can also configure feature flags for: Objective-C Swift Automatically instrumented classes and methods The following methods (for the listed classes and their sub-classes) are already instrumented by New Relic. You do not need to add custom instrumentation to trace them.

Summary categories include: View loading UI layout Database Images JSON Network Instrument your Objective-C code To have your own Objective-C code appear in interaction code breakdowns and timelines, add a _START call to the beginning of your method and a _STOP call to the end of it. Important Always include a _STOP for each _START, and only include one set of these commands in a given method. The trace system will automatically pick up the class and method name, and report performance metrics for your method to New Relic. - (void)myMethod { NR_TRACE_METHOD_START(0); // … existing code NR_TRACE_METHOD_STOP; } Copy If you are not using ARC, use this version of the _STOP macro to avoid memory leaks: NR_NONARC_TRACE_METHOD_STOP; Copy If you want your method’s performance to be included in the summary data on the APM Overview page, pass one of the NRTraceType enum values into the _START macro; for example: NR_TRACE_METHOD_START(NRTraceTypeDatabase); Copy Create and complete interactions By default, an interaction starts when a view controller is pushed. To manually start an interaction with Objective-C, use these API calls: NSString* uniqueIdentifier = NR_START_NAMED_INTERACTION(@\"name\"); Copy This macro will automatically begin tracking the name interaction trace from the current line. It will also complete any previously running interaction. It returns a unique identifier that can be used to complete that interaction by using this API call: NR_INTERACTION_STOP(uniqueIdentifier); Copy This macro will complete the interaction associated with the uniqueIdentifier if that interaction has not already completed automatically. You do not need to call this method. Rename a default interaction By default, the iOS agent will start an interaction trace when a new view controller is displayed. The interactions are named using the format Display <ViewController>. To change these default names with Objective-C, implement the - (NSString*) customNewRelicInteractionName instance method in your view controller, where the string returned becomes the interaction's name. Set a custom application version The New Relic iOS SDK allows you to set a custom application version string with Objective-C. Instead of using the string defined in CFBundleShortVersionString, call the +[NewRelic setApplicationVersion:] method and pass along the custom application version before calling +[NewRelic startWithApplicationToken:]; [NewRelic setApplicationVersion:(NSString*) appVersion]; Copy Set a custom build identifier As of version 5.1.0 of the New Relic iOS SDK, an API method allows you to set a custom build identifier that is displayed next to the application version in the Crash details page. Instead of using the CFBundleVersion string defined in Xcode with Objective-C, call the +[NewRelic setApplicationBuild:] method, and pass along the custom build identifier. [NewRelic setApplicationBuild:(NSString*) buildNumber]; Copy Create custom metrics Custom metrics can help track high level events specific to your application. With the recordMetric API, you can record arbitrary numerical data and named events with Objective-C and Swift. You can also use several API calls to record custom metrics that provide different levels of detail. Objective-C: Report custom attributes and events Use methods in the NewRelic object to report custom attributes and events. For details about the available methods for custom attributes and events with Objective-C, see the iOS SDK API reference. Methods that return BOOL results return YES if they succeed, or NO if the operation did not complete. These methods are available in versions 5.0.0 or higher of the New Relic iOS SDK. The SDK can store up to 128 user-defined custom attributes at a time. If you attempt to store more than 128 attributes, the SDK returns NO. Custom attributes names should use the simplest format needed, and New Relic recommends single word attributes, containing no spaces. Attribute phrases can be formatted in camel case, so My Custom Attribute is better specified as myCustomAttribute. As with custom metrics: Avoid using the characters / ] [ | * when naming things. Avoid multi-byte characters. Objective-C: Track custom network requests If you can express a transactional network request in terms similar to an HTTP request, you can track it. Use URLs that are well-formed and do not include highly variable paths or hostnames. For requests that complete, use this method: [NewRelic noticeNetworkRequestForURL:(NSURL*)url httpMethod:(NSString*)httpMethod withTimer:(NRTimer *)timer responseHeaders:(NSDictionary *)headers statusCode:(NSInteger)httpStatusCode bytesSent:(NSUInteger)bytesSent bytesReceived:(NSUInteger)bytesReceived responseData:(NSData *)responseData andParams:(NSDictionary *)params]; Copy Parameters include: Parameter Description url The URL of the request httpMethod The method type of the request; for example, POST, GET, etc. timer An NRTimer that timed the network request headers A dictionary containing the HTTP response headers, if available httpStatusCode The response status code If the httpStatusCode is greater than or equal to 400, the agent will record a server error and may capture the responseData body if provided. bytesSent The size of the request body bytesReceived The size of the responseBody responseData The response body data, captured if the agent records server error params params Additional parameters included in an HTTP error metric if the HTTP transaction is an error For requests that fail due to a socket or operating system error, use this method: [NewRelic noticeNetworkFailureForURL:(NSURL *)url httpMethod:(NSString*)httpMethod withTimer:(NRTimer *)timer andFailureCode:(NSInteger)iOSFailureCode]; Copy Parameters include: Parameter Description url The URL of the request httpMethod The method type of the request; for example, POST, GET, etc. timer An NRTimer that timed the network request iOSFailureCode The failure code Failure codes are interpreted as NSURLError* code. To view a complete list of supported codes, see NRConstants.h. Instrument your Swift code To have your own Swift code appear in interaction code breakdowns and timelines: Add a startTracingMethod() call to the beginning of your method. Add a endTracingMethodWithTimer() call to the end of it. Always include an endTracingMethodWithTimer() call for each startTracingMethod() reference. Include only one set of these commands in a given method. func myMethod(){ let timer = NRTimer(); NewRelic.startTracingMethod(#selector(MyClass.myMethod), object: self, timer: timer, category: NRTraceTypeNone) // … existing code NewRelic.endTracingMethodWithTimer(timer) } Copy If you want your method’s performance to be included in the summary data on the APM Overview page, pass one of the NRTraceType enum values into the startTracingMethod() macro; for example: NewRelic.startTracingMethod(#selector(MyClass.myMethod), object: self, timer: timer, category: NRTraceTypeDatabase) Copy Create and complete Swift interactions By default, an interaction starts when a view controller is pushed. To manually start an interaction, use these API calls: let uniqueIdentifier = NewRelic.startInteraction(withName: \"My Interaction\") Copy This call will automatically begin tracking an interaction trace named My Interaction from the current line. It will also complete any previously running interaction. It returns a unique identifier that can be used to complete that interaction by using this API call: NewRelic.stopCurrentInteraction(uniqueIdentifier) Copy This method will complete the interaction associated with the uniqueIdentifier if that interaction has not already completed automatically. You do not need to call this method. Rename a default Swift interaction By default, the iOS agent will start an interaction trace when a new view controller is displayed. The interactions are named using the format Display <ViewController>. To change these default names, implement the @objc func customNewRelicInteractionName() -> String method in your view controller, where the string returned becomes the interaction's name. Set a custom application version with Swift The New Relic iOS SDK allows you to set a custom application version string. Instead of using the string defined in CFBundleShortVersionString, call the NewRelic.setApplicationVersion() method, and pass along the custom application version before calling NewRelic.startWithApplicationToken();. NewRelic.setApplicationVersion(String appVersion) Copy Set a custom build identifier with Swift As of version 5.1.0 of the New Relic iOS SDK, an API method allows you to set a custom build identifier that is displayed next to the application version in the Crash details page. Instead of using the CFBundleVersion string defined in Xcode, call the NewRelic.setApplicationBuild() method, and pass along the custom build identifier. NewRelic.setApplicationBuild(buildNumber) Copy Create custom metrics with Swift Custom metrics can help track high level events specific to your application. With the recordMetric API, you can record arbitrary numerical data and named events with Objective-C and Swift.

For requests that complete, use this method: NewRelic.noticeNetworkRequestForURL(url: NSURL!, httpMethod: String!, withTimer: NRTimer!, responseHeaders:[NSObject : AnyObject]!, statusCode: Int, bytesSent: UInt, bytesReceived: UInt, responseData: NSData!, andParams: [NSObject : AnyObject]!) Copy Parameters include: Parameter Description url The URL of the request httpMethod The method type of the request; for example, POST, GET, etc. timer An NRTimer that timed the network request headers A dictionary containing the HTTP response headers, if available httpStatusCode The response status code If the httpStatusCode is greater than or equal to 400, the agent will record a server error and may capture the responseData body if provided. bytesSent The size of the request body bytesReceived The size of the responseBody responseData The response body data, captured if the agent records Server error params params Additional parameters included in an HTTP error metric if the HTTP transaction is an error For requests that fail due to a socket or operating system error, use this method: NewRelic.noticeNetworkFailureForURL(url: NSURL!, httpMethod: NSString!, withTimer: NRTimer!, andFailureCode: Int) Copy Parameters include: Parameter Description url The URL of the request httpMethod The method type of the request; for example, POST, GET, etc. timer An NRTimer that timed the network request iOSFailureCode The failure code Failure codes are interpreted as NSURLError* code.

      "body": "You can use browser monitoring in New Relic to add custom events and attributes. Page actions and views Use the browser API's addPageAction call to capture events, actions, route changes, or any end-user interactions with your application. The addPageAction call adds an event named PageAction that contains the action name and any custom attribute names and values you capture along with it. The PageAction event also contains any custom attributes you added to the PageView event. Add custom attributes to the PageView event so you can query or filter your data to answer more questions about your application. Prerequisites In order to report PageAction events, verify these prerequisites: Requirement Comments Agent version Your browser monitoring agent version must be 593 or higher. Client browser version To record PageAction events, the browser must support cross-domain XHRs. Max events per cycle PageAction events are reported every 30 seconds, with a maximum of 120 events per 30-second harvest cycle, per browser. After the 120-event limit is reached, additional events are not captured for that cycle. Event/attribute naming, data type, size Ensure you follow general requirements around event/attribute naming syntax, data types, and size. Create PageAction events To create a PageAction event: Ensure the browser agent is installed for your app. Call the newrelic.addPageAction function in the relevant part of your application's JavaScript. Wait a couple minutes for the application to run and report relevant PageAction events. Run a NRQL query of the PageAction event that includes the actionName attribute you used to capture the event (and any associated attributes you sent along with the action). Add custom attributes to PageView event The PageView event is a default browser-reported event. You can add custom attributes to the PageView event. Any custom attributes you add to the PageView event are also automatically added to the PageAction event. There are two ways to add custom attributes to the PageView event: Use setCustomAttribute browser API call To add a custom attribute to the PageView event via the browser agent, use the setCustomAttribute browser API call. This allows you to capture an attribute to be annotated on any PageAction event. Forward custom attributes from APM data If you added custom attributes to the APM Transaction event via an APM agent, you can forward those custom attributes to the PageView event automatically: Insert custom attributes by following the agent-specific instructions. Enable attribute forwarding in your agent configuration file: Agent Enable attribute forwarding C SDK Not supported. Go To enable attributes, add this to your config (disabled by default): cfg.BrowserMonitoring.Attributes.Enabled = true Copy Then add the attributes you want to include: cfg.BrowserMonitoring.Attributes.Include = []string{\"request.*\"} Copy Java Add the attributes.enabled option in the browser_monitoring stanza and set it to true. .NET Add the <attributes enabled=\"true\"> element as a child of the browserMonitoring element: <configuration xmlns=\"urn:newrelic-config\"> ... <browserMonitoring autoInstrument=\"true\"> ... <attributes enabled=\"true\"> ... </attributes> </browserMonitoring> ... </configuration> Copy If you are using manual browser instrumentation the attribute needs to be created before the GetBrowserTimingHeader() call. Node.js Add attributes: {enabled: true} to the browser_monitoring: { section of your app's newrelicjs configuration file. PHP Add the newrelic.browser_monitoring.attributes.enabled option and set it to true. Python Add the browser_monitoring.attributes.enabled option and set it to true. Ruby Add the browser_monitoring.attributes.enabled option and set it to true. PageAction and PageView attributes To see the default attributes of PageAction and PageView, see Browser events. Troubleshooting Here are some troubleshooting tips: Problem Comments Custom attributes missing If your custom attributes do not appear on PageView events, verify you are calling setCustomAttribute before the Load event on your page. If the custom attribute is called after the page load occurs, it will not be visible on PageView. PageAction events If your PageAction events do not appear when you query, check that your account is compatible. If your account is compatible, check that you are not using reserved attribute names or invalid values.",

      "body": "If you have APM, you can report custom event data. You can then query and visualize your data in New Relic. Data considerations New Relic agents send event data to New Relic as part of the normal harvest cycle every five seconds for agent versions supporting real time streaming. Sending a lot of events can increase the memory overhead of the agent. New Relic enforces an upper limit of 833 custom events every 5 seconds. Additionally, posts greater than 1MB (10^6 bytes) in size will not be recorded, regardless of the custom event limit. You can also send custom events using the Event API (without need for APM). However, be aware that custom events sent with the agent APIs are not compatible with high security mode. Tip For more information, check out New Relic University’s tutorial Adding custom data with the APM agent API. Or, go directly to the full online course Custom data with APM. Record custom events and attributes You can add your own custom APM events and attributes, which you can then use for querying and charting. This is one of several ways to report custom data. To record a custom event, follow the procedures for your New Relic language agent. To add custom attributes to APM events, you must first enable them for your APM agent, and then make an API call to record the attribute. Follow the agent-specific custom attribute procedures. When creating your own custom events and attributes, follow data requirements for: Size limits Attribute types Reserved words C SDK To add a custom event to apps monitored by the C SDK, start a transaction and use the newrelic_create_custom_event and newrelic_record_custom_event functions. For more information, see the Guide to using the C SDK API. You can then add custom attributes for your C SDK app. Go To add a custom event to apps monitored by the Go agent, use RecordCustomEvent. You can then add custom attributes for your Go app. Java Custom event collection is enabled by default in Java agent version 3.13.0 or higher. To send custom events, call recordCustomEvent. For example: Map<String, Object> eventAttributes = new HashMap<String, Object>(); NewRelic.getAgent().getInsights().recordCustomEvent(\"MyCustomEvent\", eventAttributes); Copy The first argument defines the name of your event type, and the second argument is a map with the attributes for your custom event. Event attributes must be strings or numbers. Ensure you limit the number of unique event type names that you create, and do not generate these names dynamically. For restrictions on event type names, see our documentation about limits and restricted characters and NRQL reserved words. You can change the maximum number of events recorded by the Java agent via a configuration parameter in newrelic.yml. Specify the maximum number of events to record per minute as an integer. For example, if you want to send less than the default of 10000 events: custom_insights_events: max_samples_stored: 5000 Copy To disable custom events entirely, add the following to your newrelic.yml: custom_insights_events: enabled: false Copy You can then add custom attributes for your Java app. For Java agent versions prior to 4.1.0, use the following YAML configuration: custom_insights_events.enabled: true custom_insights_events.max_samples_stored: 5000 Copy .NET Custom event collection is enabled by default in .NET agent version 4.6.29.0 or higher. To send custom events, simply call RecordCustomEvent(). For example: var eventAttributes = new Dictionary<String, Object>(); NewRelic.Api.Agent.NewRelic.RecordCustomEvent('MyCustomEvent', eventAttributes); Copy The first argument defines the name of your event type, and the second argument is an IEnumerable with the attributes for your custom event. Ensure you limit the number of unique event type names that you create, and do not generate these names dynamically. For restrictions on event type names, see our documentation about limits and restricted characters and NRQL reserved words. You can then add custom attributes for your .NET app. You can turn off custom events entirely by setting customEvents.enabled to false in newrelic.config. Node.js Custom event collection is enabled by default in Node.js agent version 1.15.0 or higher. To send custom events, simply call the relevant API. For example: recordCustomEvent(eventType, attributes) Copy Use recordCustomEvent to record an event-based metric, usually associated with a particular duration. The eventType must be an alphanumeric string less than 255 characters. The attributes must be an object of key and value pairs. The keys must be shorter than 255 characters, and the values must be string, number, or boolean. For restrictions on event type names, see our documentation about limits and restricted characters and NRQL reserved words. You can then add custom attributes for your Node.js app. To disable custom events entirely, add custom_insights_events.enabled: false to newrelic.js. PHP Custom event collection is enabled by default in PHP agent version 4.18 or higher. To send custom events, simply call the relevant API function. For example: newrelic_record_custom_event(\"WidgetSale\", array(\"color\"=>\"red\", \"weight\"=>12.5)); Copy The first argument defines the name of your event type, and the second argument is an array with the attributes for your custom event. Ensure you limit the number of unique event type names that you create, and do not generate these names dynamically. For restrictions on event type names, see our documentation about limits and restricted characters and NRQL reserved words. By default, the maximum number of custom events recorded per minute is 10,000. This setting cannot be changed. You can then add custom attributes for your PHP app. To disable custom events entirely, add newrelic.custom_insights_events.enabled = false to your newrelic.ini and restart the agent. Python Custom event collection is enabled by default in Python agent version 2.60.0.46 or higher. To send custom events, simply call the relevant API. For example: newrelic.agent. record_custom_event (event_type, params, application=None) Copy The event_type defines the name (or type) of the custom event. Attributes of the custom event should be passed in as a dictionary via the params keyword argument. Ensure you limit the number of unique event type names that you create, and do not generate these names dynamically. For limits and restrictions on event_type and params, see our documentation about limits and restricted characters and reserved words If called outside of the context of a monitored web request or background task, the call will be ignored unless the application keyword argument is provided and an application object corresponding to the application against which the exception should be recorded is provided. A suitable application object can be obtained using the newrelic.agent.application() function. You can then add custom attributes for your Python app. To disable custom events entirely, set custom_insights_events.enabled to False in your newrelic.ini configuration file. Ruby Custom event collection is enabled by default in Ruby agent version 3.9.8.273 or higher. To send custom events, simply call the relevant API. For example: ::NewRelic::Agent.record_custom_event('WidgetSale', color: 'red', weight: 12.5) Copy The first argument defines the name of your event type, and the second argument is a hash with the attributes for your custom event. Ensure you limit the number of unique event type names that you create, and do not generate these names dynamically. For restrictions on event type names, see our documentation about limits and restricted characters and NRQL reserved words. You can change the maximum number of events recorded by the Ruby agent via a configuration parameter in newrelic.yml: Add custom_insights_events.max_samples_stored: to your configuration file. Specify the maximum number of events to record per minute as an integer. For example, if you want to be able to send up to 5000 events per minute, add: custom_insights_events.max_samples_stored: 5000 Copy You can then add custom attributes for your Ruby app. To disable custom events entirely, add custom_insights_events.enabled: false to newrelic.yml. Timestamps You may not specify a timestamp on events that are collected and recorded via the agent. The agent will automatically assign a timestamp to events based on when they are recorded via the API. Limits and restricted characters See Custom event data requirements for size limits, data types, and naming syntax requirements. Reserved words Before creating custom attributes, review New Relic's list of reserved terms used by NRQL. Otherwise unexpected results may occur.",

      "body": "This document contains general requirements and rules for inserting and using custom events and their associated attributes. Additional requirements may apply based on the method you use. You can report custom events to New Relic in several ways, including: APM agent APIs Event API (There are additional requirements when using the Event API.) Browser monitoring agent APIs (There are additional requirements with the custom PageAction event.) Mobile monitoring SDK General requirements When reporting custom events and attributes, follow these general requirements for supported data types, naming syntax, and size: Requirement Description Payload Total maximum size or length: 1MB (10^6 bytes) maximum per POST. We highly recommend using compression. The payload must be encoded as UTF-8. The Event API has additional HTTP rate limits. Attribute data types Attribute values can be either a string or a numeric integer or float. If your attribute values contain date information, define it as an unformatted Unix timestamp (in seconds or milliseconds) by using the Insights data formatter. Attribute size Maximum name size: 255 bytes. Maximum attribute value size: Custom attributes sent by the agent: 255 bytes Attributes attached to custom events sent using the Event API: 4096 characters Maximum total attributes per event: 254. Exception: If you use an APM agent API, the max is 64. Maximum total attributes per event type: 48,000. Important Charts may only display the first 255 characters of attribute values. For complete attribute values, use the JSON chart type or Query API. Naming syntax Attribute names can be a combination of alphanumeric characters, colons (:), periods (.), and underscores (_). Event types (using the eventType attribute) can be a combination of alphanumeric characters, colons (:), and underscores (_). Do not use words reserved for use by NRQL. Null values The database does not store any data with a null value. Reserved words Avoid using the following reserved words as names for events and attributes. Otherwise, unexpected results may occur. Important This is not a complete list. In general, avoid using MySQL-reserved words to avoid collision with future New Relic functionality. Keyword Description accountId This is a reserved attribute name. If it's included, it will be dropped during ingest. appId Value must be an integer. If it is not an integer, the attribute name and value will be dropped during ingest. eventType The event type as stored in New Relic. New Relic agents and scripts normally report this as eventType. Can be a combination of alphanumeric characters, colons (:), and underscores (_). Be sure to review the prohibited eventType values and eventType limits. Prohibited eventType values For your eventType value, avoid using: Metric, MetricRaw, and strings prefixed with Metric[0-9] (such as Metric2 or Metric1Minute). Public_ and strings prefixed with Public_. These event types are reserved for use by New Relic. Events passed in with these eventType values will be dropped. timestamp Must be a Unix epoch timestamp. You can define timestamps either in seconds or in milliseconds. It must be +/-1 day (24 hours) of the current time on the server. Log forwarding terms The following keys are reserved by the Infrastructure agent's log forwarding feature: entity.guid, log, hostname, plugin.type, fb.input. If used, they are dropped during ingest and a warning is added to the logs. NRQL syntax terms If you need to use NRQL syntax terms as attribute names, including dotted attributes, they must be enclosed in backticks; for example, `LIMIT` or `consumer.offset`. Otherwise, avoid using these reserved words: ago, and, as, auto, begin, begintime, compare, day, days, end, endtime, explain, facet, from, hour, hours, in, is, like, limit, minute, minutes, month, months, not, null, offset, or, raw, second, seconds, select, since, timeseries, until, week, weeks, where, with Event type limits The current limit for total number of eventType values is 250 per child account in a given 24-hour time period.

      "body": "You can use browser monitoring in New Relic to add custom events and attributes. Page actions and views Use the browser API's addPageAction call to capture events, actions, route changes, or any end-user interactions with your application. The addPageAction call adds an event named PageAction that contains the action name and any custom attribute names and values you capture along with it. The PageAction event also contains any custom attributes you added to the PageView event. Add custom attributes to the PageView event so you can query or filter your data to answer more questions about your application. Prerequisites In order to report PageAction events, verify these prerequisites: Requirement Comments Agent version Your browser monitoring agent version must be 593 or higher. Client browser version To record PageAction events, the browser must support cross-domain XHRs. Max events per cycle PageAction events are reported every 30 seconds, with a maximum of 120 events per 30-second harvest cycle, per browser. After the 120-event limit is reached, additional events are not captured for that cycle. Event/attribute naming, data type, size Ensure you follow general requirements around event/attribute naming syntax, data types, and size. Create PageAction events To create a PageAction event: Ensure the browser agent is installed for your app. Call the newrelic.addPageAction function in the relevant part of your application's JavaScript. Wait a couple minutes for the application to run and report relevant PageAction events. Run a NRQL query of the PageAction event that includes the actionName attribute you used to capture the event (and any associated attributes you sent along with the action). Add custom attributes to PageView event The PageView event is a default browser-reported event. You can add custom attributes to the PageView event. Any custom attributes you add to the PageView event are also automatically added to the PageAction event. There are two ways to add custom attributes to the PageView event: Use setCustomAttribute browser API call To add a custom attribute to the PageView event via the browser agent, use the setCustomAttribute browser API call. This allows you to capture an attribute to be annotated on any PageAction event. Forward custom attributes from APM data If you added custom attributes to the APM Transaction event via an APM agent, you can forward those custom attributes to the PageView event automatically: Insert custom attributes by following the agent-specific instructions. Enable attribute forwarding in your agent configuration file: Agent Enable attribute forwarding C SDK Not supported. Go To enable attributes, add this to your config (disabled by default): cfg.BrowserMonitoring.Attributes.Enabled = true Copy Then add the attributes you want to include: cfg.BrowserMonitoring.Attributes.Include = []string{\"request.*\"} Copy Java Add the attributes.enabled option in the browser_monitoring stanza and set it to true. .NET Add the <attributes enabled=\"true\"> element as a child of the browserMonitoring element: <configuration xmlns=\"urn:newrelic-config\"> ... <browserMonitoring autoInstrument=\"true\"> ... <attributes enabled=\"true\"> ... </attributes> </browserMonitoring> ... </configuration> Copy If you are using manual browser instrumentation the attribute needs to be created before the GetBrowserTimingHeader() call. Node.js Add attributes: {enabled: true} to the browser_monitoring: { section of your app's newrelicjs configuration file. PHP Add the newrelic.browser_monitoring.attributes.enabled option and set it to true. Python Add the browser_monitoring.attributes.enabled option and set it to true. Ruby Add the browser_monitoring.attributes.enabled option and set it to true. PageAction and PageView attributes To see the default attributes of PageAction and PageView, see Browser events. Troubleshooting Here are some troubleshooting tips: Problem Comments Custom attributes missing If your custom attributes do not appear on PageView events, verify you are calling setCustomAttribute before the Load event on your page. If the custom attribute is called after the page load occurs, it will not be visible on PageView. PageAction events If your PageAction events do not appear when you query, check that your account is compatible. If your account is compatible, check that you are not using reserved attribute names or invalid values.",

Requirements For event and attribute formatting requirements and best practices, see Limits and requirements. Avoid rate limits Reporting a large number of custom events and/or attributes can cause degraded query performance. It may also result in approaching or passing data collection rate limits. For optimal performance, first think about what data you want to analyze, and then create only the events and/or attributes necessary to meet these specific goals. Be aware of the following data and subscription requirements for inserting and accessing custom data: Ensure you follow limits and requirements around event/attribute data types, naming syntax, and size. The amount of data you have access to over time depends on your data retention policy. Example use cases Two popular custom data solutions are custom events and custom attributes. There are several ways to accomplish this (more on that later in this doc), depending on your New Relic implementation and tools. Here are some common use cases for implementing custom events and attributes. Using custom attributes Custom attributes are often used to add important business and operational context to existing events. Business context might include: Customer token Customer market segment Customer value classification Workflow control values not obvious in the URIStem User/product/account privilege context Operational context might include: Which feature flags were used What datastore was accessed What cache was accessed What errors were detected and ignored (fault partitioning) Using custom events Event data is one of New Relic's four core data types. We recommend reading that definition to understand what we mean by \"event\" and why that data type is most used for reporting specific types of activity. The use cases for custom events varies widely: basically they are used for any type of activity that an organization deems important and that is not already being monitored. A couple examples: An event might represent an activity involving multiple actions, like a customer purchasing a certain combination of products. An event might record backup activity. For example, they might set up reporting of events that represent production backups of their SOLR instances into an event table, with a timestamp of when it occurred, which cluster, and the duration. Send custom events and attributes Methods for sending custom events and attributes include: Source How to send custom data APM agent Use APM agent APIs to report custom events and custom attributes. Browser monitoring agent Add custom attributes to the PageView event via the browser API call addCustomAttribute. Send PageAction event and attributes via browser API. Forward APM agent custom attributes to PageView event. Event API To report custom events not associated with other New Relic products, use the Event API. Infrastructure monitoring agent Add custom attributes to default Infrastructure events. Use the Flex integration tool to report your own custom event data. Mobile monitoring agent Use the mobile agent API to send custom events and attributes. Synthetic monitoring Add custom attributes to the SyntheticCheck event via the $util.insights tools. For ways to report other types of custom data, see: Metric API Logs Trace API Extend data retention To learn how to extend how long events are retained in your account, see our documentation about event data retention.",

      "body": "If you have APM, you can report custom event data. You can then query and visualize your data in New Relic. Data considerations New Relic agents send event data to New Relic as part of the normal harvest cycle every five seconds for agent versions supporting real time streaming. Sending a lot of events can increase the memory overhead of the agent. New Relic enforces an upper limit of 833 custom events every 5 seconds. Additionally, posts greater than 1MB (10^6 bytes) in size will not be recorded, regardless of the custom event limit. You can also send custom events using the Event API (without need for APM). However, be aware that custom events sent with the agent APIs are not compatible with high security mode. Tip For more information, check out New Relic University’s tutorial Adding custom data with the APM agent API. Or, go directly to the full online course Custom data with APM. Record custom events and attributes You can add your own custom APM events and attributes, which you can then use for querying and charting. This is one of several ways to report custom data. To record a custom event, follow the procedures for your New Relic language agent. To add custom attributes to APM events, you must first enable them for your APM agent, and then make an API call to record the attribute. Follow the agent-specific custom attribute procedures. When creating your own custom events and attributes, follow data requirements for: Size limits Attribute types Reserved words C SDK To add a custom event to apps monitored by the C SDK, start a transaction and use the newrelic_create_custom_event and newrelic_record_custom_event functions. For more information, see the Guide to using the C SDK API. You can then add custom attributes for your C SDK app. Go To add a custom event to apps monitored by the Go agent, use RecordCustomEvent. You can then add custom attributes for your Go app. Java Custom event collection is enabled by default in Java agent version 3.13.0 or higher. To send custom events, call recordCustomEvent. For example: Map<String, Object> eventAttributes = new HashMap<String, Object>(); NewRelic.getAgent().getInsights().recordCustomEvent(\"MyCustomEvent\", eventAttributes); Copy The first argument defines the name of your event type, and the second argument is a map with the attributes for your custom event. Event attributes must be strings or numbers. Ensure you limit the number of unique event type names that you create, and do not generate these names dynamically. For restrictions on event type names, see our documentation about limits and restricted characters and NRQL reserved words. You can change the maximum number of events recorded by the Java agent via a configuration parameter in newrelic.yml. Specify the maximum number of events to record per minute as an integer. For example, if you want to send less than the default of 10000 events: custom_insights_events: max_samples_stored: 5000 Copy To disable custom events entirely, add the following to your newrelic.yml: custom_insights_events: enabled: false Copy You can then add custom attributes for your Java app. For Java agent versions prior to 4.1.0, use the following YAML configuration: custom_insights_events.enabled: true custom_insights_events.max_samples_stored: 5000 Copy .NET Custom event collection is enabled by default in .NET agent version 4.6.29.0 or higher. To send custom events, simply call RecordCustomEvent(). For example: var eventAttributes = new Dictionary<String, Object>(); NewRelic.Api.Agent.NewRelic.RecordCustomEvent('MyCustomEvent', eventAttributes); Copy The first argument defines the name of your event type, and the second argument is an IEnumerable with the attributes for your custom event. Ensure you limit the number of unique event type names that you create, and do not generate these names dynamically. For restrictions on event type names, see our documentation about limits and restricted characters and NRQL reserved words. You can then add custom attributes for your .NET app. You can turn off custom events entirely by setting customEvents.enabled to false in newrelic.config. Node.js Custom event collection is enabled by default in Node.js agent version 1.15.0 or higher. To send custom events, simply call the relevant API. For example: recordCustomEvent(eventType, attributes) Copy Use recordCustomEvent to record an event-based metric, usually associated with a particular duration. The eventType must be an alphanumeric string less than 255 characters. The attributes must be an object of key and value pairs. The keys must be shorter than 255 characters, and the values must be string, number, or boolean. For restrictions on event type names, see our documentation about limits and restricted characters and NRQL reserved words. You can then add custom attributes for your Node.js app. To disable custom events entirely, add custom_insights_events.enabled: false to newrelic.js. PHP Custom event collection is enabled by default in PHP agent version 4.18 or higher. To send custom events, simply call the relevant API function. For example: newrelic_record_custom_event(\"WidgetSale\", array(\"color\"=>\"red\", \"weight\"=>12.5)); Copy The first argument defines the name of your event type, and the second argument is an array with the attributes for your custom event. Ensure you limit the number of unique event type names that you create, and do not generate these names dynamically. For restrictions on event type names, see our documentation about limits and restricted characters and NRQL reserved words. By default, the maximum number of custom events recorded per minute is 10,000. This setting cannot be changed. You can then add custom attributes for your PHP app. To disable custom events entirely, add newrelic.custom_insights_events.enabled = false to your newrelic.ini and restart the agent. Python Custom event collection is enabled by default in Python agent version 2.60.0.46 or higher. To send custom events, simply call the relevant API. For example: newrelic.agent. record_custom_event (event_type, params, application=None) Copy The event_type defines the name (or type) of the custom event. Attributes of the custom event should be passed in as a dictionary via the params keyword argument. Ensure you limit the number of unique event type names that you create, and do not generate these names dynamically. For limits and restrictions on event_type and params, see our documentation about limits and restricted characters and reserved words If called outside of the context of a monitored web request or background task, the call will be ignored unless the application keyword argument is provided and an application object corresponding to the application against which the exception should be recorded is provided. A suitable application object can be obtained using the newrelic.agent.application() function. You can then add custom attributes for your Python app. To disable custom events entirely, set custom_insights_events.enabled to False in your newrelic.ini configuration file. Ruby Custom event collection is enabled by default in Ruby agent version 3.9.8.273 or higher. To send custom events, simply call the relevant API. For example: ::NewRelic::Agent.record_custom_event('WidgetSale', color: 'red', weight: 12.5) Copy The first argument defines the name of your event type, and the second argument is a hash with the attributes for your custom event. Ensure you limit the number of unique event type names that you create, and do not generate these names dynamically. For restrictions on event type names, see our documentation about limits and restricted characters and NRQL reserved words. You can change the maximum number of events recorded by the Ruby agent via a configuration parameter in newrelic.yml: Add custom_insights_events.max_samples_stored: to your configuration file. Specify the maximum number of events to record per minute as an integer. For example, if you want to be able to send up to 5000 events per minute, add: custom_insights_events.max_samples_stored: 5000 Copy You can then add custom attributes for your Ruby app. To disable custom events entirely, add custom_insights_events.enabled: false to newrelic.yml. Timestamps You may not specify a timestamp on events that are collected and recorded via the agent. The agent will automatically assign a timestamp to events based on when they are recorded via the API. Limits and restricted characters See Custom event data requirements for size limits, data types, and naming syntax requirements. Reserved words Before creating custom attributes, review New Relic's list of reserved terms used by NRQL. Otherwise unexpected results may occur.",

This way, you'll know your baselines, and can more easily spot an anomaly like an ingest spike, as well as its source. To break down your ingested data, start from the chart on the Data ingestion page. Think of the data source bands as the Y axis, and the dates as the X axis. Click on the band you want to inspect at the spot in the X axis that corresponds with the date you want to investigate. This image shows the Metrics band for June 15 right before it's clicked. A modal opens with the account, data source, and facet selected. You can do a handful of things on this page: Change the account, data source, or facet you want to drill down into. Change the date and time to investigate. Review the results of the query in chart form. The chart displays the top 15 results for the facet query. Open the NRQL query in the Query builder where you'll find additional facets that you can use. Learn more about NRQL queries here. How we break your ingest data down Some of the content in the UI is variable, depending on your account. This information is intended to help you understand how we're working with your ingest data. The chart on the Data ingestion page shows data usage for a little longer time frame than that covered by your retention settings for each data ingest source. If you choose a date outside of your designated retention period for an ingest source, you'll get the message that there's no chart data available. Select a more recent date to fix this problem. If you inspect a data source for an account that has less than a terrabyte of data, we compute the ingest volume over a 24 hour period; otherwise, we compute it for a 1 hour period. The ingest value provided on the main Data ingestion chart will be slightly different from that reflected during inspection. This is because our facet computation is an estimate. Set alerts for data use Query and alert on usage data describes how to set alerts to get notified if you're nearing data ingest limits you don't want to cross. For example, you might set an alert on logs, which can stack up quickly in an active system. Adjust your data ingest Drop data for lower retention costs and data compliance On ingest, we apply data dropping rules so you won't be charged for data that's not useful. Learn how to set additional data dropping rules yourself. Use NerdGraph to drop entire data types or drop data attributes from data types so they’re not written to NRDB. This enables you to focus on the data you want, reduces retention costs, and avoids writing sensitive data to the database. For dropping log data, see Drop data with drop filter rules.

      "body": "At New Relic, we're super proud of NRDB, the New Relic database where we store your data. It gathers all your telemetry data in one place, gives you a connected view of all your data, and scales as your business grows. We invite you to send all your metrics, events, logs, and traces to NRDB, including those from third-party sources. We also recognize that some data might not be necessary for your business goals. You shouldn’t have to wade through data you don’t need to get to the data you do. And you definitely shouldn’t have to pay for it. That’s where our data management tools come in: they let you decide what data you send to New Relic and how long it should be stored. Data management hub: from the user profile drop down, select Manage your data. Coupled with user management tools, data management helps you get maximum value from your investment in New Relic, all while safeguarding your data. Important Not yet a New Relic customer? Sign up to create your free account in only a few seconds. Then ingest up to 100GB of data for free each month. Forever. Where to find the Data management hub To locate the data management UI: From one.newrelic.com select the account dropdown, and select Manage your data. If you're on the New Relic One user model, you can also find the Data management hub by selecting Administration > Manage data. Better cost, performance, and compliance Collecting and storing data in New Relic allows you to analyze, visualize, and alert on all your metrics, events, logs, and traces from across all of your sources. However, it’s important to manage that data for cost, performance, and in some cases, compliance reasons. The data management hub provides the tools you need to understand and control where your data is coming from, and adjust what’s stored and for how long. Important If you're on our original product-based pricing plan, you'll see your data ingest, retention, and limits in the Data management hub. The primary difference is that you're not billed on ingest, as with our New Relic One pricing plan. Not sure which plan you're on? See Overview of pricing and user model. Cost management The cost of data storage continually decreases, but storage is still an expense. The amount of data you process and store is closely related to the value you receive from New Relic, because it’s a key component of how you’re charged. Our ingest process helps you hone your data. For example, data might arrive at our processing front door compressed and of varying quality. Through ingest, that data is uncompressed, decorated with queryable attributes, and evaluated. Elements are dropped or trimmed, all before we write it to NRDB. That way, the data you store is only the data you want most. Performance management While NRDB is a phenomenally scalable database, it’s also a reality that queries across huge datasets might not return results in a timely enough fashion for your needs. You get better performance if you limit the data we store, or convert it into a format that keeps it easily queryable. Drop data to improve performance by reducing the amount of data that’s stored. Ingest and retention strategies Depending on your goals, whether to reduce costs, increase specific retention rates, or pare down your data to what’s most essential, we have a strategy for you. Learn about reducing the amount of data that comes into NRDB in Manage data coming into New Relic. Learn about customizing storage so you only store the data you want, for the period you want in Manage data stored in New Relic. Learn about dropping data in Drop data using NerdGraph.

Want to try out our Metric API? Create a New Relic account for free! No credit card required. What is the Metric API? The Metric API is a way to get metric data into New Relic. The API works by sending a POST request to our HTTP endpoint with a JSON payload containing the metric data. The Metric API is how metrics are ingested from some of our integrations, including our open source exporters (like DropWizard, OpenCensus, and Prometheus). The Metric API is also used by our Telemetry SDKs, which are language-specific tools that make it easier to use our data-ingest APIs. The Metric API can be used to: Report metric data to New Relic without a New Relic agent. Integrate metric data from an open source or in-house developed tool, library, or framework. Fully control the metric data you're sending, including the resolution and associated dimensions. Leverage the power of NRQL, New Relic's query language, for querying your metric data. Set up alerts for your metric data. Requirements Ensure outbound connectivity on TCP port 443 is allowed to the CIDR range that matches your region. The preferred configuration method is to use the DNS name metric-api.newrelic.com or metric-api.eu.newrelic.com. You'll need a New Relic license key for the New Relic account you want to send data to. For information on limits and restricted attributes, see Metric API requirements and limits. Get started If we don't have an existing integration that meets your metric-reporting needs, you have two options: Use our Telemetry SDKs, which are language-specific tools that help you send us metrics and other data. Use the Metric API directly. Find and use your data You can find data sent via the Metric API (including from integrations that use this API) in these locations: From one.newrelic.com, select Explorer and look for your service. By querying the Metric data type. For example, you can use NRQL to run: SELECT * FROM Metric Copy For more on querying, see Metric query examples. For information on querying in general, see Query data. Alert on metric data To alert on metrics created with the Metric API, use NRQL alert conditions: Select the NRQL category when defining your condition, then use the FROM Metric ... NRQL query syntax to express it. When you create these alert conditions, Alerts automatically uses the finest granularity data available (the raw metric data points) to evaluate alerts. Data retention All raw metric data points will be retained for 30 days. All additional aggregated data derived from the raw metric data points (for example, one-minute rollups) will be retained for 13 months. Any change to the retention period beyond such periods may result in a charge to you. Troubleshooting See Troubleshoot an NrIntegrationError event.",

We invite you to send all your metrics, events, logs, and traces to NRDB, including those from third-party sources. We also recognize that some data might not be necessary for your business goals. You shouldn’t have to wade through data you don’t need to get to the data you do. And you definitely shouldn’t have to pay for it. That’s where our data management tools come in: they let you decide what data you send to New Relic and how long it should be stored.

If you're on the New Relic One user model, you can also find the Data management hub by selecting Administration > Manage data. Better cost, performance, and compliance Collecting and storing data in New Relic allows you to analyze, visualize, and alert on all your metrics, events, logs, and traces from across all of your sources. However, it’s important to manage that data for cost, performance, and in some cases, compliance reasons. The data management hub provides the tools you need to understand and control where your data is coming from, and adjust what’s stored and for how long. Important If you're on our original product-based pricing plan, you'll see your data ingest, retention, and limits in the Data management hub. The primary difference is that you're not billed on ingest, as with our New Relic One pricing plan. Not sure which plan you're on? See Overview of pricing and user model. Cost management The cost of data storage continually decreases, but storage is still an expense. The amount of data you process and store is closely related to the value you receive from New Relic, because it’s a key component of how you’re charged. Our ingest process helps you hone your data. For example, data might arrive at our processing front door compressed and of varying quality. Through ingest, that data is uncompressed, decorated with queryable attributes, and evaluated. Elements are dropped or trimmed, all before we write it to NRDB. That way, the data you store is only the data you want most. Performance management While NRDB is a phenomenally scalable database, it’s also a reality that queries across huge datasets might not return results in a timely enough fashion for your needs. You get better performance if you limit the data we store, or convert it into a format that keeps it easily queryable. Drop data to improve performance by reducing the amount of data that’s stored. Ingest and retention strategies Depending on your goals, whether to reduce costs, increase specific retention rates, or pare down your data to what’s most essential, we have a strategy for you.

      "body": "When you connect your data to New Relic, we process what we receive and apply data dropping and transformation rules. Then we count the bytes needed to represent your data in a standard format, like JSON. If you're on our New Relic One pricing plan, you're charged by the number of bytes written to our database, above and beyond the standard amount that’s free. Important This doc is for accounts on our New Relic One pricing plan. If you're on our original product-based pricing plan, see Original data retention. Not sure which you're on? See Overview of pricing and user model. The Data ingestion page shows your ingest rates for a period you specify on the top-right of the Data management hub. Since 30 days ago is the default setting, but you can also set a custom date span. The page shows your daily average GBs, and the total for the range you set. You can toggle between an overall ingest view and an account view to identify which of your accounts are sending the most data. The page also provides the current month-to-date, and the projected end-of-month total ingest rates. With this information, you can proactively drop data or turn off agents in order to manage ingest and, therefore, costs. If you want to take a look at how we query the data, click the ellipsis icon (just above the chart) to slide out the chart query and open it in our query builder. And If you want to drill down further into your data usage, check out the sample queries in the usage docs. From the Login drop-down, select Manage your data, and then select Data ingestion. This is the Data ingestion page with data source and account views. Data ingestion sources The Data ingestion page describes which of your data sources provide the most data on average and during specific data ranges. The sources are described here. Billable data sources Description Timeslices (1-minute) and Metric:Raw Metrics are timeslices + MetricRaw Metric group: MetricsBytes Metric timeslice data averages to one-hour periods after eight days. After 90 days, the permanent metric data continues to be stored in one-hour periods. We currently store the raw metric data for 30 days. You are only billed for the initial ingest volume. You are not billed for subsequent rollups. APM (transactions and errors) APM events Metric group: ApmEventsBytes InfraSamples:Raw Includes multiple Infrastructure events Infrastructure host data Metric group:InfraHostBytes Information related to your servers and virtual machines coming from infrastructure agents, including storage and network data Infrastructure process data stored in ProcessSample. Metric group: InfraProcessBytes Data are metrics related to each process running on the hosts running the Infrastructure agent. This feature is turned off by default. Infrastructure integrations Metric group: InfraIntegrationBytes Performance data related to applications and services, typically managed by the customer, including data related to Docker containers, Windows services, Nagios checks, and cloud integrations such as managed services in AWS, Azure, and GCP. Logging Includes logs and LogExtendedRecord Metric group: LoggingBytes Log messages longer than 4KB are split into multiple events that, when needed, are stitched together to display the original message; this reduces the size of message data. Default Custom events Metric group: CustomEventsBytes Mobile error Mobile general Breadcrumb crash event trails Mobile session Mobile exception Mobile crash Mobile events Metric group: MobileEventsBytes Tracing Metric group: TracingBytes TracingBytes includes Span and OpenTelemetry's SpanEvent. You are not charged for DistributedTraceSummary events. Browser:EventLog Browser Browser:JSErrors PcvPerf (PageView timing) Browser events Metric group: BrowserEventsBytes Lambda Serverless Metric group: ServerlessBytes Break down data to see what's contributing to your ingest You can inspect your data ingest to gain more information about your ingest health. This way, you'll know your baselines, and can more easily spot an anomaly like an ingest spike, as well as its source. To break down your ingested data, start from the chart on the Data ingestion page. Think of the data source bands as the Y axis, and the dates as the X axis. Click on the band you want to inspect at the spot in the X axis that corresponds with the date you want to investigate. This image shows the Metrics band for June 15 right before it's clicked. A modal opens with the account, data source, and facet selected. You can do a handful of things on this page: Change the account, data source, or facet you want to drill down into. Change the date and time to investigate. Review the results of the query in chart form. The chart displays the top 15 results for the facet query. Open the NRQL query in the Query builder where you'll find additional facets that you can use. Learn more about NRQL queries here. How we break your ingest data down Some of the content in the UI is variable, depending on your account. This information is intended to help you understand how we're working with your ingest data. The chart on the Data ingestion page shows data usage for a little longer time frame than that covered by your retention settings for each data ingest source. If you choose a date outside of your designated retention period for an ingest source, you'll get the message that there's no chart data available. Select a more recent date to fix this problem. If you inspect a data source for an account that has less than a terrabyte of data, we compute the ingest volume over a 24 hour period; otherwise, we compute it for a 1 hour period. The ingest value provided on the main Data ingestion chart will be slightly different from that reflected during inspection. This is because our facet computation is an estimate. Set alerts for data use Query and alert on usage data describes how to set alerts to get notified if you're nearing data ingest limits you don't want to cross. For example, you might set an alert on logs, which can stack up quickly in an active system. Adjust your data ingest Drop data for lower retention costs and data compliance On ingest, we apply data dropping rules so you won't be charged for data that's not useful. Learn how to set additional data dropping rules yourself. Use NerdGraph to drop entire data types or drop data attributes from data types so they’re not written to NRDB. This enables you to focus on the data you want, reduces retention costs, and avoids writing sensitive data to the database. For dropping log data, see Drop data with drop filter rules. Turn off agents and integrations If you don’t need data from specific agents or integrations that you have installed, you can uninstall/delete those tools. For instructions, see the specific documentation for an agent or integration.",

      "body": "When you connect your data to New Relic, we process what we receive and apply data dropping and transformation rules. Then we count the bytes needed to represent your data in a standard format, like JSON. If you're on our New Relic One pricing plan, you're charged by the number of bytes written to our database, above and beyond the standard amount that’s free. Important This doc is for accounts on our New Relic One pricing plan. If you're on our original product-based pricing plan, see Original data retention. Not sure which you're on? See Overview of pricing and user model. The Data ingestion page shows your ingest rates for a period you specify on the top-right of the Data management hub. Since 30 days ago is the default setting, but you can also set a custom date span. The page shows your daily average GBs, and the total for the range you set. You can toggle between an overall ingest view and an account view to identify which of your accounts are sending the most data. The page also provides the current month-to-date, and the projected end-of-month total ingest rates. With this information, you can proactively drop data or turn off agents in order to manage ingest and, therefore, costs. If you want to take a look at how we query the data, click the ellipsis icon (just above the chart) to slide out the chart query and open it in our query builder. And If you want to drill down further into your data usage, check out the sample queries in the usage docs. From the Login drop-down, select Manage your data, and then select Data ingestion. This is the Data ingestion page with data source and account views. Data ingestion sources The Data ingestion page describes which of your data sources provide the most data on average and during specific data ranges. The sources are described here. Billable data sources Description Timeslices (1-minute) and Metric:Raw Metrics are timeslices + MetricRaw Metric group: MetricsBytes Metric timeslice data averages to one-hour periods after eight days. After 90 days, the permanent metric data continues to be stored in one-hour periods. We currently store the raw metric data for 30 days. You are only billed for the initial ingest volume. You are not billed for subsequent rollups. APM (transactions and errors) APM events Metric group: ApmEventsBytes InfraSamples:Raw Includes multiple Infrastructure events Infrastructure host data Metric group:InfraHostBytes Information related to your servers and virtual machines coming from infrastructure agents, including storage and network data Infrastructure process data stored in ProcessSample. Metric group: InfraProcessBytes Data are metrics related to each process running on the hosts running the Infrastructure agent. This feature is turned off by default. Infrastructure integrations Metric group: InfraIntegrationBytes Performance data related to applications and services, typically managed by the customer, including data related to Docker containers, Windows services, Nagios checks, and cloud integrations such as managed services in AWS, Azure, and GCP. Logging Includes logs and LogExtendedRecord Metric group: LoggingBytes Log messages longer than 4KB are split into multiple events that, when needed, are stitched together to display the original message; this reduces the size of message data. Default Custom events Metric group: CustomEventsBytes Mobile error Mobile general Breadcrumb crash event trails Mobile session Mobile exception Mobile crash Mobile events Metric group: MobileEventsBytes Tracing Metric group: TracingBytes TracingBytes includes Span and OpenTelemetry's SpanEvent. You are not charged for DistributedTraceSummary events. Browser:EventLog Browser Browser:JSErrors PcvPerf (PageView timing) Browser events Metric group: BrowserEventsBytes Lambda Serverless Metric group: ServerlessBytes Break down data to see what's contributing to your ingest You can inspect your data ingest to gain more information about your ingest health. This way, you'll know your baselines, and can more easily spot an anomaly like an ingest spike, as well as its source. To break down your ingested data, start from the chart on the Data ingestion page. Think of the data source bands as the Y axis, and the dates as the X axis. Click on the band you want to inspect at the spot in the X axis that corresponds with the date you want to investigate. This image shows the Metrics band for June 15 right before it's clicked. A modal opens with the account, data source, and facet selected. You can do a handful of things on this page: Change the account, data source, or facet you want to drill down into. Change the date and time to investigate. Review the results of the query in chart form. The chart displays the top 15 results for the facet query. Open the NRQL query in the Query builder where you'll find additional facets that you can use. Learn more about NRQL queries here. How we break your ingest data down Some of the content in the UI is variable, depending on your account. This information is intended to help you understand how we're working with your ingest data. The chart on the Data ingestion page shows data usage for a little longer time frame than that covered by your retention settings for each data ingest source. If you choose a date outside of your designated retention period for an ingest source, you'll get the message that there's no chart data available. Select a more recent date to fix this problem. If you inspect a data source for an account that has less than a terrabyte of data, we compute the ingest volume over a 24 hour period; otherwise, we compute it for a 1 hour period. The ingest value provided on the main Data ingestion chart will be slightly different from that reflected during inspection. This is because our facet computation is an estimate. Set alerts for data use Query and alert on usage data describes how to set alerts to get notified if you're nearing data ingest limits you don't want to cross. For example, you might set an alert on logs, which can stack up quickly in an active system. Adjust your data ingest Drop data for lower retention costs and data compliance On ingest, we apply data dropping rules so you won't be charged for data that's not useful. Learn how to set additional data dropping rules yourself. Use NerdGraph to drop entire data types or drop data attributes from data types so they’re not written to NRDB. This enables you to focus on the data you want, reduces retention costs, and avoids writing sensitive data to the database. For dropping log data, see Drop data with drop filter rules. Turn off agents and integrations If you don’t need data from specific agents or integrations that you have installed, you can uninstall/delete those tools. For instructions, see the specific documentation for an agent or integration.",

      "body": "At New Relic, we're super proud of NRDB, the New Relic database where we store your data. It gathers all your telemetry data in one place, gives you a connected view of all your data, and scales as your business grows. We invite you to send all your metrics, events, logs, and traces to NRDB, including those from third-party sources. We also recognize that some data might not be necessary for your business goals. You shouldn’t have to wade through data you don’t need to get to the data you do. And you definitely shouldn’t have to pay for it. That’s where our data management tools come in: they let you decide what data you send to New Relic and how long it should be stored. Data management hub: from the user profile drop down, select Manage your data. Coupled with user management tools, data management helps you get maximum value from your investment in New Relic, all while safeguarding your data. Important Not yet a New Relic customer? Sign up to create your free account in only a few seconds. Then ingest up to 100GB of data for free each month. Forever. Where to find the Data management hub To locate the data management UI: From one.newrelic.com select the account dropdown, and select Manage your data. If you're on the New Relic One user model, you can also find the Data management hub by selecting Administration > Manage data. Better cost, performance, and compliance Collecting and storing data in New Relic allows you to analyze, visualize, and alert on all your metrics, events, logs, and traces from across all of your sources. However, it’s important to manage that data for cost, performance, and in some cases, compliance reasons. The data management hub provides the tools you need to understand and control where your data is coming from, and adjust what’s stored and for how long. Important If you're on our original product-based pricing plan, you'll see your data ingest, retention, and limits in the Data management hub. The primary difference is that you're not billed on ingest, as with our New Relic One pricing plan. Not sure which plan you're on? See Overview of pricing and user model. Cost management The cost of data storage continually decreases, but storage is still an expense. The amount of data you process and store is closely related to the value you receive from New Relic, because it’s a key component of how you’re charged. Our ingest process helps you hone your data. For example, data might arrive at our processing front door compressed and of varying quality. Through ingest, that data is uncompressed, decorated with queryable attributes, and evaluated. Elements are dropped or trimmed, all before we write it to NRDB. That way, the data you store is only the data you want most. Performance management While NRDB is a phenomenally scalable database, it’s also a reality that queries across huge datasets might not return results in a timely enough fashion for your needs. You get better performance if you limit the data we store, or convert it into a format that keeps it easily queryable. Drop data to improve performance by reducing the amount of data that’s stored. Ingest and retention strategies Depending on your goals, whether to reduce costs, increase specific retention rates, or pare down your data to what’s most essential, we have a strategy for you. Learn about reducing the amount of data that comes into NRDB in Manage data coming into New Relic. Learn about customizing storage so you only store the data you want, for the period you want in Manage data stored in New Relic. Learn about dropping data in Drop data using NerdGraph. And for dropping log data, see Drop data with drop filter rules.",

      "body": "Use the Metric API to send custom metrics to the New Relic platform. This document includes a quick start to send your first custom metric, plus detailed information on how to format and send your metric data. Quick start: Send metric data We report the metric types count, gauge, and summary. For more information on metrics see our documentation. Metric data is submitted to New Relic through an HTTP POST request. Each request is composed of one or more metric data points, which consist of a metric name, a timestamp, and a value. Follow this example to send your first metric data points to New Relic: Get the license key for the account you want to report data to. Insert the license key into the following JSON, and then send the JSON to our endpoint. This example creates a single metric data point for a metric named memory.heap, but you can create additional attributes or data points by specifying metric types or adding optional common blocks. curl -vvv -k -H \"Content-Type: application/json\" \\ -H \"Api-Key: NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY\" \\ -X POST https://metric-api.newrelic.com/metric/v1 \\ --data '[{ \"metrics\":[{ \"name\":\"memory.heap\", \"type\":\"gauge\", \"value\":2.3, \"timestamp\":CURRENT_TIME, \"attributes\":{\"host.name\":\"dev.server.com\"} }] }]' Copy The metric should be available in New Relic in a few seconds. You can query the data from any NRQL interface using this query: FROM Metric SELECT max(memory.heap) TIMESERIES Copy For more on where data shows up, see Find Metric API data. Endpoint URL Use an HTTP POST when sending metric data to the metric API endpoint: https://metric-api.newrelic.com/metric/v1 Copy Tip If your account hosts data in the EU data center, ensure you're using the proper API endpoints for EU region accounts. HTTP request headers Include the following HTTP request headers with the POST request. You can send some parameters as query parameters instead of request headers. Header Send as a query parameter? Details Content-Type No Required. Must be application/json. Content-Length No Required (usually set automatically by the HTTP client). The length of the request body in octets (8-bit bytes) unless sent with chunked encoding. This header is generally set by default by the underlying HTTP client sending the data and in most cases should not require any additional effort by the end user. Api-Key Yes Required. A license key for the account you want to report data to. If this is provided as both a header and a query parameter, the values must match. Content-Encoding No Required if GZIP. The value must be GZIP or Identity. If no value is present, then Identity is assumed. x-request-id No Optional - Reserved for future use. The value must be a valid UUID4. The value is expected to be unique for each request. HTTP request body The body of the HTTP POST request must be in JSON format. The following describes the requirements and recommendations for the JSON payload. The payload must be encoded as UTF-8. Structure The JSON payload uses this structure: The JSON payload is an array of maps. Each map must contain a metrics key whose value is an array containing one or more metric data points. A metric data point is identified by a name, value, and timestamp along with an optional set of attributes. JSON payload creating two metrics This example payload creates two metrics. service.errors.all is a count metric with three attributes and service.memory is a gauge metric with two attributes. [ { \"metrics\": [ { \"name\": \"service.errors.all\", \"type\": \"count\", \"value\": 15, \"timestamp\": [CURRENT_TIME](#optional-map-attributes), \"interval.ms\": 10000, \"attributes\": { \"service.response.statuscode\": \"400\", \"host.name\": \"dev.server.com\", \"service.name\": \"foo\" } }, { \"name\": \"service.memory\", \"type\": \"gauge\", \"value\": 2.7, \"timestamp\": CURRENT_TIME, \"attributes\": { \"host.name\": \"dev.server.com\", \"app.name\": \"foo\" } } ] } ] Copy Required key-value pairs Each metric data point map in the metrics array uses the following key-value structure: Key Description name string Required. The name of the metric. The value must be less than 255 characters. value number or map Required. The value varies depending on the metric type. For gauge and count the value should be a single number. For summary, the value should be a map with key-value pairs specifying the count, sum, min, and max. timestamp long Required. The metric's start time in Unix time. Defaults to the current time in UTC timezone. This field also support seconds, microseconds, and nanoseconds. However, the data will be converted to milliseconds for storage and query. Metrics reported with a timestamp older than 48 hours ago or newer than 24 hours from the time they are reported are dropped. interval.ms positive long Required for count and summary metric types. The length of the time window. type Recommended. This should be one of the supported metric types. If you do not specify a type, then this will default to a gauge. attributes strings, JSON numbers, or booleans Recommended. A map of key value pairs associated with this specific metric. Values can be strings, JSON numbers, or booleans. Keys are case-sensitive and must be less than 255 characters. JSON payload with three metric types Here's an example payload containing one metric data point for each metric type: [ { \"metrics\": [ { \"name\": \"cache.misses\", \"type\": \"count\", \"value\": 15, \"timestamp\": [CURRENT_TIME](#optional-map-attributes), \"interval.ms\": 10000, \"attributes\": { \"cache.name\": \"myCache\", \"host.name\": \"dev.server.com\" } }, { \"name\": \"temperature\", \"type\": \"gauge\", \"value\": 15, \"timestamp\": CURRENT_TIME, \"attributes\": { \"city\": \"Portland\", \"state\": \"Oregon\" } }, { \"name\": \"service.response.duration\", \"type\": \"summary\", \"value\": { \"count\": 5, \"sum\": 0.004382655, \"min\": 0.0005093, \"max\": 0.001708826 }, \"interval.ms\": 10000, \"timestamp\": CURRENT_TIME, \"attributes\": { \"host.name\": \"dev.server.com\", \"app.name\": \"foo\" } } ] } ] Copy Share attributes across metrics with common If you want to include a set of attributes on multiple metrics (and not add the same attributes for each metric), you can use the common block. This is an optional map that specifies information that applies to all associated metric data points. Values in the common section will be overridden if the same key exists on a metric data point. The block can include: Attribute Description timestamp long The metric's start time in Unix time. This defaults to the current time in the UTC timezone. This field also supports seconds, microseconds, and nanoseconds. However, the data will be converted to milliseconds for storage and later querying. interval.ms positive long Required for count and summary.The length of the time window. attributes strings, JSON numbers, or booleans A map of key-value pairs associated with this specific metric. Values can be strings, JSON numbers, or booleans. Example of common attributes In the following example payload, three metrics are sent. All three metrics share app.name and host.name attributes, specified in the common block. Each metric also has a unique value for another attribute, server.response.statuscode. [ { \"common\" : { \"timestamp\": 1531414060739, \"interval.ms\": 10000, \"attributes\": { \"app.name\": \"foo\", \"host.name\": \"dev.server.com\" } }, \"metrics\": [ { \"name\": \"service.errors.all\", \"type\": \"count\", \"value\": 9, \"attributes\": { \"service.response.statuscode\": \"400\" } }, { \"name\": \"service.errors.all\", \"type\": \"count\", \"value\": 4, \"attributes\": { \"service.response.statuscode\": \"500\" } }, { \"name\": \"service.response.duration\", \"type\": \"summary\", \"value\": { \"count\": 5, \"sum\": 0.004382655, \"min\": 0.0005093, \"max\": 0.001708826 }, \"attributes\": { \"service.response.statuscode\": \"200\" } } ] } ] Copy Response validation and status codes The Metric API returns a 202 response code for successful requests. When your data is accepted, an HTTP 202 response code is returned with a response structure like this: HTTP/1.1 202 Accepted Content-Type: application/json; charset=UTF-8 Content-Length: 52 Access-Control-Allow-Methods: GET, POST, PUT, HEAD, OPTIONS Access-Control-Allow-Credentials: true Access-Control-Allow-Origin: * Connection: keep-alive {\"requestId\":\"f0e7bfff-001a-b000-0000-01682bcf4565\"} Copy Missing data with 202 response A 202 code indicates the API did receive your data, and that the data passed basic validation checks. Normally, your data will be available for querying within a few seconds. However, New Relic runs additional validation asynchronously after receiving your data. If you receive a 202 response but can't find your metric, this indicates that New Relic found an error during this asynchronous validation. You can find these errors by querying NrIntegrationError events in the account associated with the Insert API key you used. The requestId for each request will be tagged on the NrIntegrationError event. For more information, see Troubleshoot an NRIntegrationError event. Status codes The Metric API can return the following HTTP status codes: Status code Definition 202 Data accepted. 400 Structure of the request is invalid. 403 Authentication failure. 404 The request path is incorrect. 405 Used a request method other than POST. 408 The request took too long to reach the endpoint. 411 The Content-Length header wasn’t included. 413 The payload was too big. Payloads must be under 1MB (10^6 bytes). 414 The request URI was too long. 415 The Content-Type or Content-Encoding was invalid. 429 The request rate quota has been exceeded. 431 The request headers are too long. 5xx There was a server error (please retry).",

      "body": "The New Relic Event API is one way to report custom events to New Relic. The Event API lets you send custom event data to your New Relic account with a POST command. These events are then queryable and chartable using NRQL. Want to try out our Event API? Create a New Relic account for free! No credit card required. Related content: Learn about all options for reporting custom events. For details about how event data is retained, see Event data retention. For how to add attributes to existing events, see Add custom attributes. Check out New Relic University’s tutorial Adding custom events with the Event API (aka the Insights API). Or, go directly to the full online course Custom data. Requirements For Event API limits and restricted attributes, see Limits. Ensure outbound connectivity on TCP port 443 is allowed to the CIDR range that matches your region. The preferred configuration method is to use the DNS name insights-collector.newrelic.com or insights-collector.eu01.nr-data.net. Basic workflow The Event API is an asynchronous endpoint. This allows you to send a very large volume of POSTS, reliably, with very low response latency. Tip If your account hosts data in the EU data center, ensure you are using the proper API endpoints for EU region accounts. To send a custom event to a New Relic account: Get a license key for the account you want to report data to. Before creating custom events or attributes, review New Relic's list of reserved terms used by NRQL. Generate JSON for the event by instrumenting your application, querying an API, or some other method. Submit a compressed JSON payload (for example, gzip or deflate) to the HTTPS endpoint using curl in a POST request. Recommendation: Set up NRQL alert conditions to notify you when parsing errors occur. This method will send the events directly into your account, where they will be accessible from any NRQL interface or with the Query API. The Event API limits the size, rate, and characters allowed in custom events. Also, like other events available in NRQL, custom events cannot be updated or deleted after they are created. If you have problems with your custom event, follow the troubleshooting procedures or create a new custom event. Get the license key You'll need a license key. License keys are associated with an account, not a specific user. This means that anyone in the account with access to that key can use it. You can submit multiple event types to the same account with the same license key. However, to help ensure security, we recommend that you use different keys for different applications or data sources. Alternatively, you can use an Insights insert keyfor this API, but we recommend using a license key. Format the JSON The Event API accepts specific formats for attributes included in the payload. Only float or string values are allowed. JSON format guidelines When defining attributes for your custom events, follow these JSON format guidelines. Attributes JSON format guidelines eventType Required: The event's name. Float and string values Float value format: \"label\":value String value format: \"label\":\"value\" Data types The API only accepts key-value pairs, not map/object or array values. Supported data types for this API are strings and numbers (integers or floats). For more information, see Data requirements. Digits in strings For performance-related reasons, we do not cast values submitted to the API. For example, we treat 123 as a number and \"123\" as a string. The database will only store up to 64 bit numbers. Any numbers larger than 64 bits will be truncated. Dates For attributes that contain date information, use an unformatted Unix timestamp in the Insights data formatter. You can define the date attribute either in seconds or in milliseconds, both relative to the Unix epoch. Time Unless otherwise specified, the timestamp for a submitted event is the time it was submitted to New Relic. To specify a different time for the event, use the timestamp attribute. JSON example Here is an example of a typical JSON data set for sending with the API. This call sends two Purchase type events as a JSON array. You can add multiple events in a single HTTP call using a JSON array. [ { \"eventType\":\"Purchase\", \"account\":3, \"amount\":259.54 }, { \"eventType\":\"Purchase\", \"account\":5, \"amount\":12309, \"product\":\"Item\" } ] Copy When generating the JSON, make sure your attributes are properly formatted. Limits and restricted characters The following size and rate limits apply to events sent via the Event API: Max events per API call: 2K Payload total size: 1MB(10^6 bytes) maximum per POST. We highly recommend using compression. The payload must be encoded as UTF-8. Number of attributes per event: 255 maximum Length of attribute name: 255 characters Length of attribute value: 4096 maximum character length There are rate limits on the number of HTTP requests per minute sent to the Event API. Some specific attributes have additional restrictions: accountId: This is a reserved attribute name. If it is included, it will be dropped during ingest. entity.guid, entity.name, and entity.type: These attributes are used internally to identify entities. Any values submitted with these keys in the attributes section of a metric data point may cause undefined behavior such as missing entities in the UI or telemetry not associating with the expected entities. For more information please refer to Entity synthesis. appId: Value must be an integer. If it is not an integer, the attribute name and value will be dropped during ingest. eventType: Can be a combination of alphanumeric characters, _ underscores, and : colons. timestamp: Must be a Unix epoch timestamp. You can define timestamps either in seconds or in milliseconds. Submit the custom event Data submitted to the Event API uses a compressed JSON format in a simple HTTPS POST request. This example uses gzip, but you can also use deflate. Linux/bash example gzip -c example_events.json | curl -X POST -H \"Content-Type: application/json\" -H \"Api-Key: YOUR_LICENSE_KEY\" -H \"Content-Encoding: gzip\" https://insights-collector.newrelic.com/v1/accounts/YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID/events --data-binary @- Copy Windows/PowerShell example $accountId = \"YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID\" $insertkey = \"YOUR_LICENSE_KEY\" # Replace with your custom event for the body $body = '[{\"eventType\": \"powershell\", \"account\": 4, \"amount\": 123, \"fileLocation\": \"c:\\\\temp2\", \"zipped\": \"true\" }]' $headers = @{} $headers.Add(\"Api-Key\", \"$insertkey\") $headers.Add(\"Content-Encoding\", \"gzip\") $encoding = [System.Text.Encoding]::UTF8 $enc_data = $encoding.GetBytes($body) $output = [System.IO.MemoryStream]::new() $gzipStream = New-Object System.IO.Compression.GzipStream $output, ([IO.Compression.CompressionMode]::Compress) $gzipStream.Write($enc_data, 0, $enc_data.Length) $gzipStream.Close() $gzipBody = $output.ToArray() Invoke-WebRequest -Headers $headers -Method Post -Body $gzipBody \"https://insights-collector.newrelic.com/v1/accounts/$accountId/events\" Copy Important Always use compression with every payload. This allows you to send more data, and it saves resources during parsing. Before generating your HTTP request, make sure it is properly formatted, including: The Api-Key contains the correct license key. The Content-Type is application/json. The request uses POST only. The API does not accept PUT and GET requests. The API supports HTTP/1.1 persistent connections. This is helpful to manage client-side performance under heavy event loads. Verify or troubleshoot request response The Event API follows a two-step process to process requests: The Event API synchronously acknowledges or rejects the request based on validation of the headers and payload size. The Event API asynchronously parses the payload after a successful HTTP response is provided to the client. This may generate an error due to missing or malformed data. These are classified as submission errors or parsing errors. All successful submissions receive a 200 response, regardless of any data errors that may exist within the payload. The response includes a uuid, which is a unique ID created for each request. The uuid also appears in any error events created for the request. Other potential issues: 10-second timeout: API calls exceeding 10 seconds will time out. Large payloads: Payloads exceeding 100 KB may see increased response times. Recommendation: In addition to checking for a success message, create a NRQL query of your data to verify it's available. Success response code Success message Comments 200 {\"success\":true,\"uuid\":\"xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx\"} Copy Submission errors Payloads with submission errors are handled and returned to the sender through an HTTP response code. To troubleshoot payload submission errors, refer to these HTTP response codes. Submission errors Troubleshooting 400 Missing or invalid content length: Unable to process empty request. 403 Missing or invalid key: Invalid license key. Register a valid license key. 408 Request timed out: Request took too long to process. 413 Content too large: Request is too large to process. Refer to the limits and restricted characters to troubleshoot. 415 Invalid content type: Must be application/JSON. The Event API accepts any content type except multi-part/related and assumes it can be parsed to JSON. 429 Too many requests due to rate limiting. 503 Service temporarily unavailable: Retry request Parsing errors Parsing errors occur if: An event is sent within a payload, but it is either missing data or is exceeding maximum limits. New Relic will drop the individual event from the payload, generate an NrIntegrationError event, and process the rest. The JSON payload includes malformed JSON or missing required data. Payloads with parsing errors receive a 200 response to indicate a successful submission. To help resolve parsing errors, a new NrIntegrationError event type is created. All parsing errors are due to NRQL queries. For error messages related to dropped events, New Relic will include the number of events that were dropped as part of the message. To troubleshoot requests with parsing errors, refer to these error messages. Parsing errors Troubleshooting X event(s) rejected because attribute appId was not an integer An appId attribute has a non-integer value, such as a decimal value or string. X event(s) rejected because eventType cannot contain the following characters: [., \\] An eventType attributed included an invalid character, such as a period or backslash. X event(s) rejected because attribute is missing attribute name An attribute name was set to null or an empty string. X event(s) rejected because attribute name exceeded maximum length An attribute name has more than 255 characters. X event(s) rejected because attribute value exceeded maximum length An attribute value was longer than 4096 characters. X event(s) rejected because event exceeded maximum number of attributes An event has more than 255 attributes. X event(s) rejected because missing required attributes eventType The eventType attribute is required for the custom event. Error parsing JSON payload There was an error parsing the request JSON because of formatting problems or corrupted data. Query and alert with NrIntegrationError The NrIntegrationError event allows you to query and set alerts on custom data being sent to your New Relic account. Recommendation: To get alerts for parsing errors, create a NRQL alert condition for NrIntegrationError. Use this example NRQL query: SELECT message FROM NrIntegrationError WHERE newRelicFeature = 'Event API' AND category = 'EventApiException' Copy NrIntegrationError attributes Troubleshooting timestamp The timestamp when the request was received. The timestamp attribute takes a 64-bit integer Unix timestamp within the last 24 hours. You can define timestamps either in seconds or in milliseconds, both relative to the Unix epoch. Do not use a decimal for the timestamp. If a decimal is used, the attribute will default to the timestamp when the custom event was created. newRelicFeature The name of the feature experiencing errors. For all custom event parsing errors, this will be Event API. apiKeyPrefix The first six characters of the license key used for the request that generated an error. requestId The uuid returned by the the API for the request that generated an error. Category The category of the error. For custom events, this is EventApiException. Message Contents of the error message. Name The error's name. For custom events, this is always EventValidationException. eventTypeSample One of the event types that generated the error, when available. Find your data To find data sent via the Event API (and from integrations that use this API), you can query it. For example, to query a custom event using NRQL, you would run: SELECT * FROM YOUR_CUSTOM_EVENT Copy For more on how to query, see Query data. Limit on HTTP requests The Event API has a rate limit of 100,000 HTTP requests (POSTs) per minute, per account. (Note that this is not a limit on the number of events per minute; only on the number of POSTs per minute.) This limit helps ensure that large traffic spikes in accounts across our multi-tenant platform do not negatively affect how the service performs for you. If your API usage exceeds 100k POSTs in a 1-minute window, we will reject subsequent API requests with a 429 response code for the remainder of the 1-minute window. At the end of the 1-minute window, the counter will be reset and allow traffic to resume. This limit is intended to be an upper threshold that you shouldn't hit under normal scenarios. If you have a high number of 429 responses, consider using the API less. If you are expecting a higher-than-normal activity level in the near future and want to prepare for that, contact technical support.",

This example creates a single metric data point for a metric named memory.heap, but you can create additional attributes or data points by specifying metric types or adding optional common blocks. curl -vvv -k -H \"Content-Type: application/json\" \\ -H \"Api-Key: NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY\" \\ -X POST https://metric-api.newrelic.com/metric/v1 \\ --data '[{ \"metrics\":[{ \"name\":\"memory.heap\", \"type\":\"gauge\", \"value\":2.3, \"timestamp\":CURRENT_TIME, \"attributes\":{\"host.name\":\"dev.server.com\"} }] }]' Copy The metric should be available in New Relic in a few seconds. You can query the data from any NRQL interface using this query: FROM Metric SELECT max(memory.heap) TIMESERIES Copy For more on where data shows up, see Find Metric API data. Endpoint URL Use an HTTP POST when sending metric data to the metric API endpoint: https://metric-api.newrelic.com/metric/v1 Copy Tip If your account hosts data in the EU data center, ensure you're using the proper API endpoints for EU region accounts. HTTP request headers Include the following HTTP request headers with the POST request. You can send some parameters as query parameters instead of request headers. Header Send as a query parameter? Details Content-Type No Required. Must be application/json. Content-Length No Required (usually set automatically by the HTTP client). The length of the request body in octets (8-bit bytes) unless sent with chunked encoding. This header is generally set by default by the underlying HTTP client sending the data and in most cases should not require any additional effort by the end user. Api-Key Yes Required. A license key for the account you want to report data to. If this is provided as both a header and a query parameter, the values must match. Content-Encoding No Required if GZIP. The value must be GZIP or Identity. If no value is present, then Identity is assumed. x-request-id No Optional - Reserved for future use. The value must be a valid UUID4. The value is expected to be unique for each request. HTTP request body The body of the HTTP POST request must be in JSON format. The following describes the requirements and recommendations for the JSON payload. The payload must be encoded as UTF-8. Structure The JSON payload uses this structure: The JSON payload is an array of maps. Each map must contain a metrics key whose value is an array containing one or more metric data points. A metric data point is identified by a name, value, and timestamp along with an optional set of attributes. JSON payload creating two metrics This example payload creates two metrics. service.errors.all is a count metric with three attributes and service.memory is a gauge metric with two attributes. [ { \"metrics\": [ { \"name\": \"service.errors.all\", \"type\": \"count\", \"value\": 15, \"timestamp\": [CURRENT_TIME](#optional-map-attributes), \"interval.ms\": 10000, \"attributes\": { \"service.response.statuscode\": \"400\", \"host.name\": \"dev.server.com\", \"service.name\": \"foo\" } }, { \"name\": \"service.memory\", \"type\": \"gauge\", \"value\": 2.7, \"timestamp\": CURRENT_TIME, \"attributes\": { \"host.name\": \"dev.server.com\", \"app.name\": \"foo\" } } ] } ] Copy Required key-value pairs Each metric data point map in the metrics array uses the following key-value structure: Key Description name string Required. The name of the metric. The value must be less than 255 characters. value number or map Required. The value varies depending on the metric type. For gauge and count the value should be a single number. For summary, the value should be a map with key-value pairs specifying the count, sum, min, and max. timestamp long Required. The metric's start time in Unix time. Defaults to the current time in UTC timezone. This field also support seconds, microseconds, and nanoseconds. However, the data will be converted to milliseconds for storage and query. Metrics reported with a timestamp older than 48 hours ago or newer than 24 hours from the time they are reported are dropped. interval.ms positive long Required for count and summary metric types. The length of the time window. type Recommended. This should be one of the supported metric types. If you do not specify a type, then this will default to a gauge. attributes strings, JSON numbers, or booleans Recommended. A map of key value pairs associated with this specific metric. Values can be strings, JSON numbers, or booleans. Keys are case-sensitive and must be less than 255 characters. JSON payload with three metric types Here's an example payload containing one metric data point for each metric type: [ { \"metrics\": [ { \"name\": \"cache.misses\", \"type\": \"count\", \"value\": 15, \"timestamp\": [CURRENT_TIME](#optional-map-attributes), \"interval.ms\": 10000, \"attributes\": { \"cache.name\": \"myCache\", \"host.name\": \"dev.server.com\" } }, { \"name\": \"temperature\", \"type\": \"gauge\", \"value\": 15, \"timestamp\": CURRENT_TIME, \"attributes\": { \"city\": \"Portland\", \"state\": \"Oregon\" } }, { \"name\": \"service.response.duration\", \"type\": \"summary\", \"value\": { \"count\": 5, \"sum\": 0.004382655, \"min\": 0.0005093, \"max\": 0.001708826 }, \"interval.ms\": 10000, \"timestamp\": CURRENT_TIME, \"attributes\": { \"host.name\": \"dev.server.com\", \"app.name\": \"foo\" } } ] } ] Copy Share attributes across metrics with common If you want to include a set of attributes on multiple metrics (and not add the same attributes for each metric), you can use the common block. This is an optional map that specifies information that applies to all associated metric data points. Values in the common section will be overridden if the same key exists on a metric data point. The block can include: Attribute Description timestamp long The metric's start time in Unix time. This defaults to the current time in the UTC timezone. This field also supports seconds, microseconds, and nanoseconds. However, the data will be converted to milliseconds for storage and later querying. interval.ms positive long Required for count and summary.The length of the time window. attributes strings, JSON numbers, or booleans A map of key-value pairs associated with this specific metric. Values can be strings, JSON numbers, or booleans. Example of common attributes In the following example payload, three metrics are sent. All three metrics share app.name and host.name attributes, specified in the common block. Each metric also has a unique value for another attribute, server.response.statuscode. [ { \"common\" : { \"timestamp\": 1531414060739, \"interval.ms\": 10000, \"attributes\": { \"app.name\": \"foo\", \"host.name\": \"dev.server.com\" } }, \"metrics\": [ { \"name\": \"service.errors.all\", \"type\": \"count\", \"value\": 9, \"attributes\": { \"service.response.statuscode\": \"400\" } }, { \"name\": \"service.errors.all\", \"type\": \"count\", \"value\": 4, \"attributes\": { \"service.response.statuscode\": \"500\" } }, { \"name\": \"service.response.duration\", \"type\": \"summary\", \"value\": { \"count\": 5, \"sum\": 0.004382655, \"min\": 0.0005093, \"max\": 0.001708826 }, \"attributes\": { \"service.response.statuscode\": \"200\" } } ] } ] Copy Response validation and status codes The Metric API returns a 202 response code for successful requests. When your data is accepted, an HTTP 202 response code is returned with a response structure like this: HTTP/1.1 202 Accepted Content-Type: application/json; charset=UTF-8 Content-Length: 52 Access-Control-Allow-Methods: GET, POST, PUT, HEAD, OPTIONS Access-Control-Allow-Credentials: true Access-Control-Allow-Origin: * Connection: keep-alive {\"requestId\":\"f0e7bfff-001a-b000-0000-01682bcf4565\"} Copy Missing data with 202 response A 202 code indicates the API did receive your data, and that the data passed basic validation checks. Normally, your data will be available for querying within a few seconds. However, New Relic runs additional validation asynchronously after receiving your data. If you receive a 202 response but can't find your metric, this indicates that New Relic found an error during this asynchronous validation. You can find these errors by querying NrIntegrationError events in the account associated with the Insert API key you used. The requestId for each request will be tagged on the NrIntegrationError event. For more information, see Troubleshoot an NRIntegrationError event. Status codes The Metric API can return the following HTTP status codes: Status code Definition 202 Data accepted. 400 Structure of the request is invalid. 403 Authentication failure. 404 The request path is incorrect. 405 Used a request method other than POST. 408 The request took too long to reach the endpoint. 411 The Content-Length header wasn’t included. 413 The payload was too big. Payloads must be under 1MB (10^6 bytes). 414 The request URI was too long. 415 The Content-Type or Content-Encoding was invalid. 429 The request rate quota has been exceeded. 431 The request headers are too long. 5xx There was a server error (please retry).",

Want to try out our Metric API? Create a New Relic account for free! No credit card required. What is the Metric API? The Metric API is a way to get metric data into New Relic. The API works by sending a POST request to our HTTP endpoint with a JSON payload containing the metric data. The Metric API is how metrics are ingested from some of our integrations, including our open source exporters (like DropWizard, OpenCensus, and Prometheus). The Metric API is also used by our Telemetry SDKs, which are language-specific tools that make it easier to use our data-ingest APIs. The Metric API can be used to: Report metric data to New Relic without a New Relic agent. Integrate metric data from an open source or in-house developed tool, library, or framework. Fully control the metric data you're sending, including the resolution and associated dimensions. Leverage the power of NRQL, New Relic's query language, for querying your metric data. Set up alerts for your metric data. Requirements Ensure outbound connectivity on TCP port 443 is allowed to the CIDR range that matches your region. The preferred configuration method is to use the DNS name metric-api.newrelic.com or metric-api.eu.newrelic.com. You'll need a New Relic license key for the New Relic account you want to send data to. For information on limits and restricted attributes, see Metric API requirements and limits. Get started If we don't have an existing integration that meets your metric-reporting needs, you have two options: Use our Telemetry SDKs, which are language-specific tools that help you send us metrics and other data. Use the Metric API directly. Find and use your data You can find data sent via the Metric API (including from integrations that use this API) in these locations: From one.newrelic.com, select Explorer and look for your service. By querying the Metric data type. For example, you can use NRQL to run: SELECT * FROM Metric Copy For more on querying, see Metric query examples. For information on querying in general, see Query data. Alert on metric data To alert on metrics created with the Metric API, use NRQL alert conditions: Select the NRQL category when defining your condition, then use the FROM Metric ... NRQL query syntax to express it. When you create these alert conditions, Alerts automatically uses the finest granularity data available (the raw metric data points) to evaluate alerts. Data retention All raw metric data points will be retained for 30 days. All additional aggregated data derived from the raw metric data points (for example, one-minute rollups) will be retained for 13 months. Any change to the retention period beyond such periods may result in a charge to you. Troubleshooting See Troubleshoot an NrIntegrationError event.",

      "body": "The New Relic Event API is one way to report custom events to New Relic. The Event API lets you send custom event data to your New Relic account with a POST command. These events are then queryable and chartable using NRQL. Want to try out our Event API? Create a New Relic account for free! No credit card required. Related content: Learn about all options for reporting custom events. For details about how event data is retained, see Event data retention. For how to add attributes to existing events, see Add custom attributes. Check out New Relic University’s tutorial Adding custom events with the Event API (aka the Insights API). Or, go directly to the full online course Custom data. Requirements For Event API limits and restricted attributes, see Limits. Ensure outbound connectivity on TCP port 443 is allowed to the CIDR range that matches your region. The preferred configuration method is to use the DNS name insights-collector.newrelic.com or insights-collector.eu01.nr-data.net. Basic workflow The Event API is an asynchronous endpoint. This allows you to send a very large volume of POSTS, reliably, with very low response latency. Tip If your account hosts data in the EU data center, ensure you are using the proper API endpoints for EU region accounts. To send a custom event to a New Relic account: Get a license key for the account you want to report data to. Before creating custom events or attributes, review New Relic's list of reserved terms used by NRQL. Generate JSON for the event by instrumenting your application, querying an API, or some other method. Submit a compressed JSON payload (for example, gzip or deflate) to the HTTPS endpoint using curl in a POST request. Recommendation: Set up NRQL alert conditions to notify you when parsing errors occur. This method will send the events directly into your account, where they will be accessible from any NRQL interface or with the Query API. The Event API limits the size, rate, and characters allowed in custom events. Also, like other events available in NRQL, custom events cannot be updated or deleted after they are created. If you have problems with your custom event, follow the troubleshooting procedures or create a new custom event. Get the license key You'll need a license key. License keys are associated with an account, not a specific user. This means that anyone in the account with access to that key can use it. You can submit multiple event types to the same account with the same license key. However, to help ensure security, we recommend that you use different keys for different applications or data sources. Alternatively, you can use an Insights insert keyfor this API, but we recommend using a license key. Format the JSON The Event API accepts specific formats for attributes included in the payload. Only float or string values are allowed. JSON format guidelines When defining attributes for your custom events, follow these JSON format guidelines. Attributes JSON format guidelines eventType Required: The event's name. Float and string values Float value format: \"label\":value String value format: \"label\":\"value\" Data types The API only accepts key-value pairs, not map/object or array values. Supported data types for this API are strings and numbers (integers or floats). For more information, see Data requirements. Digits in strings For performance-related reasons, we do not cast values submitted to the API. For example, we treat 123 as a number and \"123\" as a string. The database will only store up to 64 bit numbers. Any numbers larger than 64 bits will be truncated. Dates For attributes that contain date information, use an unformatted Unix timestamp in the Insights data formatter. You can define the date attribute either in seconds or in milliseconds, both relative to the Unix epoch. Time Unless otherwise specified, the timestamp for a submitted event is the time it was submitted to New Relic. To specify a different time for the event, use the timestamp attribute. JSON example Here is an example of a typical JSON data set for sending with the API. This call sends two Purchase type events as a JSON array. You can add multiple events in a single HTTP call using a JSON array. [ { \"eventType\":\"Purchase\", \"account\":3, \"amount\":259.54 }, { \"eventType\":\"Purchase\", \"account\":5, \"amount\":12309, \"product\":\"Item\" } ] Copy When generating the JSON, make sure your attributes are properly formatted. Limits and restricted characters The following size and rate limits apply to events sent via the Event API: Max events per API call: 2K Payload total size: 1MB(10^6 bytes) maximum per POST. We highly recommend using compression. The payload must be encoded as UTF-8. Number of attributes per event: 255 maximum Length of attribute name: 255 characters Length of attribute value: 4096 maximum character length There are rate limits on the number of HTTP requests per minute sent to the Event API. Some specific attributes have additional restrictions: accountId: This is a reserved attribute name. If it is included, it will be dropped during ingest. entity.guid, entity.name, and entity.type: These attributes are used internally to identify entities. Any values submitted with these keys in the attributes section of a metric data point may cause undefined behavior such as missing entities in the UI or telemetry not associating with the expected entities. For more information please refer to Entity synthesis. appId: Value must be an integer. If it is not an integer, the attribute name and value will be dropped during ingest. eventType: Can be a combination of alphanumeric characters, _ underscores, and : colons. timestamp: Must be a Unix epoch timestamp. You can define timestamps either in seconds or in milliseconds. Submit the custom event Data submitted to the Event API uses a compressed JSON format in a simple HTTPS POST request. This example uses gzip, but you can also use deflate. Linux/bash example gzip -c example_events.json | curl -X POST -H \"Content-Type: application/json\" -H \"Api-Key: YOUR_LICENSE_KEY\" -H \"Content-Encoding: gzip\" https://insights-collector.newrelic.com/v1/accounts/YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID/events --data-binary @- Copy Windows/PowerShell example $accountId = \"YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID\" $insertkey = \"YOUR_LICENSE_KEY\" # Replace with your custom event for the body $body = '[{\"eventType\": \"powershell\", \"account\": 4, \"amount\": 123, \"fileLocation\": \"c:\\\\temp2\", \"zipped\": \"true\" }]' $headers = @{} $headers.Add(\"Api-Key\", \"$insertkey\") $headers.Add(\"Content-Encoding\", \"gzip\") $encoding = [System.Text.Encoding]::UTF8 $enc_data = $encoding.GetBytes($body) $output = [System.IO.MemoryStream]::new() $gzipStream = New-Object System.IO.Compression.GzipStream $output, ([IO.Compression.CompressionMode]::Compress) $gzipStream.Write($enc_data, 0, $enc_data.Length) $gzipStream.Close() $gzipBody = $output.ToArray() Invoke-WebRequest -Headers $headers -Method Post -Body $gzipBody \"https://insights-collector.newrelic.com/v1/accounts/$accountId/events\" Copy Important Always use compression with every payload. This allows you to send more data, and it saves resources during parsing. Before generating your HTTP request, make sure it is properly formatted, including: The Api-Key contains the correct license key. The Content-Type is application/json. The request uses POST only. The API does not accept PUT and GET requests. The API supports HTTP/1.1 persistent connections. This is helpful to manage client-side performance under heavy event loads. Verify or troubleshoot request response The Event API follows a two-step process to process requests: The Event API synchronously acknowledges or rejects the request based on validation of the headers and payload size. The Event API asynchronously parses the payload after a successful HTTP response is provided to the client. This may generate an error due to missing or malformed data. These are classified as submission errors or parsing errors. All successful submissions receive a 200 response, regardless of any data errors that may exist within the payload. The response includes a uuid, which is a unique ID created for each request. The uuid also appears in any error events created for the request. Other potential issues: 10-second timeout: API calls exceeding 10 seconds will time out. Large payloads: Payloads exceeding 100 KB may see increased response times. Recommendation: In addition to checking for a success message, create a NRQL query of your data to verify it's available. Success response code Success message Comments 200 {\"success\":true,\"uuid\":\"xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx\"} Copy Submission errors Payloads with submission errors are handled and returned to the sender through an HTTP response code. To troubleshoot payload submission errors, refer to these HTTP response codes. Submission errors Troubleshooting 400 Missing or invalid content length: Unable to process empty request. 403 Missing or invalid key: Invalid license key. Register a valid license key. 408 Request timed out: Request took too long to process. 413 Content too large: Request is too large to process. Refer to the limits and restricted characters to troubleshoot. 415 Invalid content type: Must be application/JSON. The Event API accepts any content type except multi-part/related and assumes it can be parsed to JSON. 429 Too many requests due to rate limiting. 503 Service temporarily unavailable: Retry request Parsing errors Parsing errors occur if: An event is sent within a payload, but it is either missing data or is exceeding maximum limits. New Relic will drop the individual event from the payload, generate an NrIntegrationError event, and process the rest. The JSON payload includes malformed JSON or missing required data. Payloads with parsing errors receive a 200 response to indicate a successful submission. To help resolve parsing errors, a new NrIntegrationError event type is created. All parsing errors are due to NRQL queries. For error messages related to dropped events, New Relic will include the number of events that were dropped as part of the message. To troubleshoot requests with parsing errors, refer to these error messages. Parsing errors Troubleshooting X event(s) rejected because attribute appId was not an integer An appId attribute has a non-integer value, such as a decimal value or string. X event(s) rejected because eventType cannot contain the following characters: [., \\] An eventType attributed included an invalid character, such as a period or backslash. X event(s) rejected because attribute is missing attribute name An attribute name was set to null or an empty string. X event(s) rejected because attribute name exceeded maximum length An attribute name has more than 255 characters. X event(s) rejected because attribute value exceeded maximum length An attribute value was longer than 4096 characters. X event(s) rejected because event exceeded maximum number of attributes An event has more than 255 attributes. X event(s) rejected because missing required attributes eventType The eventType attribute is required for the custom event. Error parsing JSON payload There was an error parsing the request JSON because of formatting problems or corrupted data. Query and alert with NrIntegrationError The NrIntegrationError event allows you to query and set alerts on custom data being sent to your New Relic account. Recommendation: To get alerts for parsing errors, create a NRQL alert condition for NrIntegrationError. Use this example NRQL query: SELECT message FROM NrIntegrationError WHERE newRelicFeature = 'Event API' AND category = 'EventApiException' Copy NrIntegrationError attributes Troubleshooting timestamp The timestamp when the request was received. The timestamp attribute takes a 64-bit integer Unix timestamp within the last 24 hours. You can define timestamps either in seconds or in milliseconds, both relative to the Unix epoch. Do not use a decimal for the timestamp. If a decimal is used, the attribute will default to the timestamp when the custom event was created. newRelicFeature The name of the feature experiencing errors. For all custom event parsing errors, this will be Event API. apiKeyPrefix The first six characters of the license key used for the request that generated an error. requestId The uuid returned by the the API for the request that generated an error. Category The category of the error. For custom events, this is EventApiException. Message Contents of the error message. Name The error's name. For custom events, this is always EventValidationException. eventTypeSample One of the event types that generated the error, when available. Find your data To find data sent via the Event API (and from integrations that use this API), you can query it. For example, to query a custom event using NRQL, you would run: SELECT * FROM YOUR_CUSTOM_EVENT Copy For more on how to query, see Query data. Limit on HTTP requests The Event API has a rate limit of 100,000 HTTP requests (POSTs) per minute, per account. (Note that this is not a limit on the number of events per minute; only on the number of POSTs per minute.) This limit helps ensure that large traffic spikes in accounts across our multi-tenant platform do not negatively affect how the service performs for you. If your API usage exceeds 100k POSTs in a 1-minute window, we will reject subsequent API requests with a 429 response code for the remainder of the 1-minute window. At the end of the 1-minute window, the counter will be reset and allow traffic to resume. This limit is intended to be an upper threshold that you shouldn't hit under normal scenarios. If you have a high number of 429 responses, consider using the API less. If you are expecting a higher-than-normal activity level in the near future and want to prepare for that, contact technical support.",

Want to try out our Metric API? Create a New Relic account for free! No credit card required. What is the Metric API? The Metric API is a way to get metric data into New Relic. The API works by sending a POST request to our HTTP endpoint with a JSON payload containing the metric data. The Metric API is how metrics are ingested from some of our integrations, including our open source exporters (like DropWizard, OpenCensus, and Prometheus). The Metric API is also used by our Telemetry SDKs, which are language-specific tools that make it easier to use our data-ingest APIs. The Metric API can be used to: Report metric data to New Relic without a New Relic agent. Integrate metric data from an open source or in-house developed tool, library, or framework. Fully control the metric data you're sending, including the resolution and associated dimensions. Leverage the power of NRQL, New Relic's query language, for querying your metric data. Set up alerts for your metric data. Requirements Ensure outbound connectivity on TCP port 443 is allowed to the CIDR range that matches your region. The preferred configuration method is to use the DNS name metric-api.newrelic.com or metric-api.eu.newrelic.com. You'll need a New Relic license key for the New Relic account you want to send data to. For information on limits and restricted attributes, see Metric API requirements and limits. Get started If we don't have an existing integration that meets your metric-reporting needs, you have two options: Use our Telemetry SDKs, which are language-specific tools that help you send us metrics and other data. Use the Metric API directly. Find and use your data You can find data sent via the Metric API (including from integrations that use this API) in these locations: From one.newrelic.com, select Explorer and look for your service. By querying the Metric data type. For example, you can use NRQL to run: SELECT * FROM Metric Copy For more on querying, see Metric query examples. For information on querying in general, see Query data. Alert on metric data To alert on metrics created with the Metric API, use NRQL alert conditions: Select the NRQL category when defining your condition, then use the FROM Metric ... NRQL query syntax to express it. When you create these alert conditions, Alerts automatically uses the finest granularity data available (the raw metric data points) to evaluate alerts. Data retention All raw metric data points will be retained for 30 days. All additional aggregated data derived from the raw metric data points (for example, one-minute rollups) will be retained for 13 months. Any change to the retention period beyond such periods may result in a charge to you. Troubleshooting See Troubleshoot an NrIntegrationError event.",

      "body": "Use the Metric API to send custom metrics to the New Relic platform. This document includes a quick start to send your first custom metric, plus detailed information on how to format and send your metric data. Quick start: Send metric data We report the metric types count, gauge, and summary. For more information on metrics see our documentation. Metric data is submitted to New Relic through an HTTP POST request. Each request is composed of one or more metric data points, which consist of a metric name, a timestamp, and a value. Follow this example to send your first metric data points to New Relic: Get the license key for the account you want to report data to. Insert the license key into the following JSON, and then send the JSON to our endpoint. This example creates a single metric data point for a metric named memory.heap, but you can create additional attributes or data points by specifying metric types or adding optional common blocks. curl -vvv -k -H \"Content-Type: application/json\" \\ -H \"Api-Key: NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY\" \\ -X POST https://metric-api.newrelic.com/metric/v1 \\ --data '[{ \"metrics\":[{ \"name\":\"memory.heap\", \"type\":\"gauge\", \"value\":2.3, \"timestamp\":CURRENT_TIME, \"attributes\":{\"host.name\":\"dev.server.com\"} }] }]' Copy The metric should be available in New Relic in a few seconds. You can query the data from any NRQL interface using this query: FROM Metric SELECT max(memory.heap) TIMESERIES Copy For more on where data shows up, see Find Metric API data. Endpoint URL Use an HTTP POST when sending metric data to the metric API endpoint: https://metric-api.newrelic.com/metric/v1 Copy Tip If your account hosts data in the EU data center, ensure you're using the proper API endpoints for EU region accounts. HTTP request headers Include the following HTTP request headers with the POST request. You can send some parameters as query parameters instead of request headers. Header Send as a query parameter? Details Content-Type No Required. Must be application/json. Content-Length No Required (usually set automatically by the HTTP client). The length of the request body in octets (8-bit bytes) unless sent with chunked encoding. This header is generally set by default by the underlying HTTP client sending the data and in most cases should not require any additional effort by the end user. Api-Key Yes Required. A license key for the account you want to report data to. If this is provided as both a header and a query parameter, the values must match. Content-Encoding No Required if GZIP. The value must be GZIP or Identity. If no value is present, then Identity is assumed. x-request-id No Optional - Reserved for future use. The value must be a valid UUID4. The value is expected to be unique for each request. HTTP request body The body of the HTTP POST request must be in JSON format. The following describes the requirements and recommendations for the JSON payload. The payload must be encoded as UTF-8. Structure The JSON payload uses this structure: The JSON payload is an array of maps. Each map must contain a metrics key whose value is an array containing one or more metric data points. A metric data point is identified by a name, value, and timestamp along with an optional set of attributes. JSON payload creating two metrics This example payload creates two metrics. service.errors.all is a count metric with three attributes and service.memory is a gauge metric with two attributes. [ { \"metrics\": [ { \"name\": \"service.errors.all\", \"type\": \"count\", \"value\": 15, \"timestamp\": [CURRENT_TIME](#optional-map-attributes), \"interval.ms\": 10000, \"attributes\": { \"service.response.statuscode\": \"400\", \"host.name\": \"dev.server.com\", \"service.name\": \"foo\" } }, { \"name\": \"service.memory\", \"type\": \"gauge\", \"value\": 2.7, \"timestamp\": CURRENT_TIME, \"attributes\": { \"host.name\": \"dev.server.com\", \"app.name\": \"foo\" } } ] } ] Copy Required key-value pairs Each metric data point map in the metrics array uses the following key-value structure: Key Description name string Required. The name of the metric. The value must be less than 255 characters. value number or map Required. The value varies depending on the metric type. For gauge and count the value should be a single number. For summary, the value should be a map with key-value pairs specifying the count, sum, min, and max. timestamp long Required. The metric's start time in Unix time. Defaults to the current time in UTC timezone. This field also support seconds, microseconds, and nanoseconds. However, the data will be converted to milliseconds for storage and query. Metrics reported with a timestamp older than 48 hours ago or newer than 24 hours from the time they are reported are dropped. interval.ms positive long Required for count and summary metric types. The length of the time window. type Recommended. This should be one of the supported metric types. If you do not specify a type, then this will default to a gauge. attributes strings, JSON numbers, or booleans Recommended. A map of key value pairs associated with this specific metric. Values can be strings, JSON numbers, or booleans. Keys are case-sensitive and must be less than 255 characters. JSON payload with three metric types Here's an example payload containing one metric data point for each metric type: [ { \"metrics\": [ { \"name\": \"cache.misses\", \"type\": \"count\", \"value\": 15, \"timestamp\": [CURRENT_TIME](#optional-map-attributes), \"interval.ms\": 10000, \"attributes\": { \"cache.name\": \"myCache\", \"host.name\": \"dev.server.com\" } }, { \"name\": \"temperature\", \"type\": \"gauge\", \"value\": 15, \"timestamp\": CURRENT_TIME, \"attributes\": { \"city\": \"Portland\", \"state\": \"Oregon\" } }, { \"name\": \"service.response.duration\", \"type\": \"summary\", \"value\": { \"count\": 5, \"sum\": 0.004382655, \"min\": 0.0005093, \"max\": 0.001708826 }, \"interval.ms\": 10000, \"timestamp\": CURRENT_TIME, \"attributes\": { \"host.name\": \"dev.server.com\", \"app.name\": \"foo\" } } ] } ] Copy Share attributes across metrics with common If you want to include a set of attributes on multiple metrics (and not add the same attributes for each metric), you can use the common block. This is an optional map that specifies information that applies to all associated metric data points. Values in the common section will be overridden if the same key exists on a metric data point. The block can include: Attribute Description timestamp long The metric's start time in Unix time. This defaults to the current time in the UTC timezone. This field also supports seconds, microseconds, and nanoseconds. However, the data will be converted to milliseconds for storage and later querying. interval.ms positive long Required for count and summary.The length of the time window. attributes strings, JSON numbers, or booleans A map of key-value pairs associated with this specific metric. Values can be strings, JSON numbers, or booleans. Example of common attributes In the following example payload, three metrics are sent. All three metrics share app.name and host.name attributes, specified in the common block. Each metric also has a unique value for another attribute, server.response.statuscode. [ { \"common\" : { \"timestamp\": 1531414060739, \"interval.ms\": 10000, \"attributes\": { \"app.name\": \"foo\", \"host.name\": \"dev.server.com\" } }, \"metrics\": [ { \"name\": \"service.errors.all\", \"type\": \"count\", \"value\": 9, \"attributes\": { \"service.response.statuscode\": \"400\" } }, { \"name\": \"service.errors.all\", \"type\": \"count\", \"value\": 4, \"attributes\": { \"service.response.statuscode\": \"500\" } }, { \"name\": \"service.response.duration\", \"type\": \"summary\", \"value\": { \"count\": 5, \"sum\": 0.004382655, \"min\": 0.0005093, \"max\": 0.001708826 }, \"attributes\": { \"service.response.statuscode\": \"200\" } } ] } ] Copy Response validation and status codes The Metric API returns a 202 response code for successful requests. When your data is accepted, an HTTP 202 response code is returned with a response structure like this: HTTP/1.1 202 Accepted Content-Type: application/json; charset=UTF-8 Content-Length: 52 Access-Control-Allow-Methods: GET, POST, PUT, HEAD, OPTIONS Access-Control-Allow-Credentials: true Access-Control-Allow-Origin: * Connection: keep-alive {\"requestId\":\"f0e7bfff-001a-b000-0000-01682bcf4565\"} Copy Missing data with 202 response A 202 code indicates the API did receive your data, and that the data passed basic validation checks. Normally, your data will be available for querying within a few seconds. However, New Relic runs additional validation asynchronously after receiving your data. If you receive a 202 response but can't find your metric, this indicates that New Relic found an error during this asynchronous validation. You can find these errors by querying NrIntegrationError events in the account associated with the Insert API key you used. The requestId for each request will be tagged on the NrIntegrationError event. For more information, see Troubleshoot an NRIntegrationError event. Status codes The Metric API can return the following HTTP status codes: Status code Definition 202 Data accepted. 400 Structure of the request is invalid. 403 Authentication failure. 404 The request path is incorrect. 405 Used a request method other than POST. 408 The request took too long to reach the endpoint. 411 The Content-Length header wasn’t included. 413 The payload was too big. Payloads must be under 1MB (10^6 bytes). 414 The request URI was too long. 415 The Content-Type or Content-Encoding was invalid. 429 The request rate quota has been exceeded. 431 The request headers are too long. 5xx There was a server error (please retry).",

      "body": "New Relic's Metric API can be used to send metric data to New Relic from a variety of sources. This API is how metrics from some of our integrations and exporters get into New Relic. Want to try out our Metric API? Create a New Relic account for free! No credit card required. What is the Metric API? The Metric API is a way to get metric data into New Relic. The API works by sending a POST request to our HTTP endpoint with a JSON payload containing the metric data. The Metric API is how metrics are ingested from some of our integrations, including our open source exporters (like DropWizard, OpenCensus, and Prometheus). The Metric API is also used by our Telemetry SDKs, which are language-specific tools that make it easier to use our data-ingest APIs. The Metric API can be used to: Report metric data to New Relic without a New Relic agent. Integrate metric data from an open source or in-house developed tool, library, or framework. Fully control the metric data you're sending, including the resolution and associated dimensions. Leverage the power of NRQL, New Relic's query language, for querying your metric data. Set up alerts for your metric data. Requirements Ensure outbound connectivity on TCP port 443 is allowed to the CIDR range that matches your region. The preferred configuration method is to use the DNS name metric-api.newrelic.com or metric-api.eu.newrelic.com. You'll need a New Relic license key for the New Relic account you want to send data to. For information on limits and restricted attributes, see Metric API requirements and limits. Get started If we don't have an existing integration that meets your metric-reporting needs, you have two options: Use our Telemetry SDKs, which are language-specific tools that help you send us metrics and other data. Use the Metric API directly. Find and use your data You can find data sent via the Metric API (including from integrations that use this API) in these locations: From one.newrelic.com, select Explorer and look for your service. By querying the Metric data type. For example, you can use NRQL to run: SELECT * FROM Metric Copy For more on querying, see Metric query examples. For information on querying in general, see Query data. Alert on metric data To alert on metrics created with the Metric API, use NRQL alert conditions: Select the NRQL category when defining your condition, then use the FROM Metric ... NRQL query syntax to express it. When you create these alert conditions, Alerts automatically uses the finest granularity data available (the raw metric data points) to evaluate alerts. Data retention All raw metric data points will be retained for 30 days. All additional aggregated data derived from the raw metric data points (for example, one-minute rollups) will be retained for 13 months. Any change to the retention period beyond such periods may result in a charge to you. Troubleshooting See Troubleshoot an NrIntegrationError event.",

      "body": "Use the Metric API to send custom metrics to the New Relic platform. This document includes a quick start to send your first custom metric, plus detailed information on how to format and send your metric data. Quick start: Send metric data We report the metric types count, gauge, and summary. For more information on metrics see our documentation. Metric data is submitted to New Relic through an HTTP POST request. Each request is composed of one or more metric data points, which consist of a metric name, a timestamp, and a value. Follow this example to send your first metric data points to New Relic: Get the license key for the account you want to report data to. Insert the license key into the following JSON, and then send the JSON to our endpoint. This example creates a single metric data point for a metric named memory.heap, but you can create additional attributes or data points by specifying metric types or adding optional common blocks. curl -vvv -k -H \"Content-Type: application/json\" \\ -H \"Api-Key: NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY\" \\ -X POST https://metric-api.newrelic.com/metric/v1 \\ --data '[{ \"metrics\":[{ \"name\":\"memory.heap\", \"type\":\"gauge\", \"value\":2.3, \"timestamp\":CURRENT_TIME, \"attributes\":{\"host.name\":\"dev.server.com\"} }] }]' Copy The metric should be available in New Relic in a few seconds. You can query the data from any NRQL interface using this query: FROM Metric SELECT max(memory.heap) TIMESERIES Copy For more on where data shows up, see Find Metric API data. Endpoint URL Use an HTTP POST when sending metric data to the metric API endpoint: https://metric-api.newrelic.com/metric/v1 Copy Tip If your account hosts data in the EU data center, ensure you're using the proper API endpoints for EU region accounts. HTTP request headers Include the following HTTP request headers with the POST request. You can send some parameters as query parameters instead of request headers. Header Send as a query parameter? Details Content-Type No Required. Must be application/json. Content-Length No Required (usually set automatically by the HTTP client). The length of the request body in octets (8-bit bytes) unless sent with chunked encoding. This header is generally set by default by the underlying HTTP client sending the data and in most cases should not require any additional effort by the end user. Api-Key Yes Required. A license key for the account you want to report data to. If this is provided as both a header and a query parameter, the values must match. Content-Encoding No Required if GZIP. The value must be GZIP or Identity. If no value is present, then Identity is assumed. x-request-id No Optional - Reserved for future use. The value must be a valid UUID4. The value is expected to be unique for each request. HTTP request body The body of the HTTP POST request must be in JSON format. The following describes the requirements and recommendations for the JSON payload. The payload must be encoded as UTF-8. Structure The JSON payload uses this structure: The JSON payload is an array of maps. Each map must contain a metrics key whose value is an array containing one or more metric data points. A metric data point is identified by a name, value, and timestamp along with an optional set of attributes. JSON payload creating two metrics This example payload creates two metrics. service.errors.all is a count metric with three attributes and service.memory is a gauge metric with two attributes. [ { \"metrics\": [ { \"name\": \"service.errors.all\", \"type\": \"count\", \"value\": 15, \"timestamp\": [CURRENT_TIME](#optional-map-attributes), \"interval.ms\": 10000, \"attributes\": { \"service.response.statuscode\": \"400\", \"host.name\": \"dev.server.com\", \"service.name\": \"foo\" } }, { \"name\": \"service.memory\", \"type\": \"gauge\", \"value\": 2.7, \"timestamp\": CURRENT_TIME, \"attributes\": { \"host.name\": \"dev.server.com\", \"app.name\": \"foo\" } } ] } ] Copy Required key-value pairs Each metric data point map in the metrics array uses the following key-value structure: Key Description name string Required. The name of the metric. The value must be less than 255 characters. value number or map Required. The value varies depending on the metric type. For gauge and count the value should be a single number. For summary, the value should be a map with key-value pairs specifying the count, sum, min, and max. timestamp long Required. The metric's start time in Unix time. Defaults to the current time in UTC timezone. This field also support seconds, microseconds, and nanoseconds. However, the data will be converted to milliseconds for storage and query. Metrics reported with a timestamp older than 48 hours ago or newer than 24 hours from the time they are reported are dropped. interval.ms positive long Required for count and summary metric types. The length of the time window. type Recommended. This should be one of the supported metric types. If you do not specify a type, then this will default to a gauge. attributes strings, JSON numbers, or booleans Recommended. A map of key value pairs associated with this specific metric. Values can be strings, JSON numbers, or booleans. Keys are case-sensitive and must be less than 255 characters. JSON payload with three metric types Here's an example payload containing one metric data point for each metric type: [ { \"metrics\": [ { \"name\": \"cache.misses\", \"type\": \"count\", \"value\": 15, \"timestamp\": [CURRENT_TIME](#optional-map-attributes), \"interval.ms\": 10000, \"attributes\": { \"cache.name\": \"myCache\", \"host.name\": \"dev.server.com\" } }, { \"name\": \"temperature\", \"type\": \"gauge\", \"value\": 15, \"timestamp\": CURRENT_TIME, \"attributes\": { \"city\": \"Portland\", \"state\": \"Oregon\" } }, { \"name\": \"service.response.duration\", \"type\": \"summary\", \"value\": { \"count\": 5, \"sum\": 0.004382655, \"min\": 0.0005093, \"max\": 0.001708826 }, \"interval.ms\": 10000, \"timestamp\": CURRENT_TIME, \"attributes\": { \"host.name\": \"dev.server.com\", \"app.name\": \"foo\" } } ] } ] Copy Share attributes across metrics with common If you want to include a set of attributes on multiple metrics (and not add the same attributes for each metric), you can use the common block. This is an optional map that specifies information that applies to all associated metric data points. Values in the common section will be overridden if the same key exists on a metric data point. The block can include: Attribute Description timestamp long The metric's start time in Unix time. This defaults to the current time in the UTC timezone. This field also supports seconds, microseconds, and nanoseconds. However, the data will be converted to milliseconds for storage and later querying. interval.ms positive long Required for count and summary.The length of the time window. attributes strings, JSON numbers, or booleans A map of key-value pairs associated with this specific metric. Values can be strings, JSON numbers, or booleans. Example of common attributes In the following example payload, three metrics are sent. All three metrics share app.name and host.name attributes, specified in the common block. Each metric also has a unique value for another attribute, server.response.statuscode. [ { \"common\" : { \"timestamp\": 1531414060739, \"interval.ms\": 10000, \"attributes\": { \"app.name\": \"foo\", \"host.name\": \"dev.server.com\" } }, \"metrics\": [ { \"name\": \"service.errors.all\", \"type\": \"count\", \"value\": 9, \"attributes\": { \"service.response.statuscode\": \"400\" } }, { \"name\": \"service.errors.all\", \"type\": \"count\", \"value\": 4, \"attributes\": { \"service.response.statuscode\": \"500\" } }, { \"name\": \"service.response.duration\", \"type\": \"summary\", \"value\": { \"count\": 5, \"sum\": 0.004382655, \"min\": 0.0005093, \"max\": 0.001708826 }, \"attributes\": { \"service.response.statuscode\": \"200\" } } ] } ] Copy Response validation and status codes The Metric API returns a 202 response code for successful requests. When your data is accepted, an HTTP 202 response code is returned with a response structure like this: HTTP/1.1 202 Accepted Content-Type: application/json; charset=UTF-8 Content-Length: 52 Access-Control-Allow-Methods: GET, POST, PUT, HEAD, OPTIONS Access-Control-Allow-Credentials: true Access-Control-Allow-Origin: * Connection: keep-alive {\"requestId\":\"f0e7bfff-001a-b000-0000-01682bcf4565\"} Copy Missing data with 202 response A 202 code indicates the API did receive your data, and that the data passed basic validation checks. Normally, your data will be available for querying within a few seconds. However, New Relic runs additional validation asynchronously after receiving your data. If you receive a 202 response but can't find your metric, this indicates that New Relic found an error during this asynchronous validation. You can find these errors by querying NrIntegrationError events in the account associated with the Insert API key you used. The requestId for each request will be tagged on the NrIntegrationError event. For more information, see Troubleshoot an NRIntegrationError event. Status codes The Metric API can return the following HTTP status codes: Status code Definition 202 Data accepted. 400 Structure of the request is invalid. 403 Authentication failure. 404 The request path is incorrect. 405 Used a request method other than POST. 408 The request took too long to reach the endpoint. 411 The Content-Length header wasn’t included. 413 The payload was too big. Payloads must be under 1MB (10^6 bytes). 414 The request URI was too long. 415 The Content-Type or Content-Encoding was invalid. 429 The request rate quota has been exceeded. 431 The request headers are too long. 5xx There was a server error (please retry).",

      "body": "The New Relic Event API is one way to report custom events to New Relic. The Event API lets you send custom event data to your New Relic account with a POST command. These events are then queryable and chartable using NRQL. Want to try out our Event API? Create a New Relic account for free! No credit card required. Related content: Learn about all options for reporting custom events. For details about how event data is retained, see Event data retention. For how to add attributes to existing events, see Add custom attributes. Check out New Relic University’s tutorial Adding custom events with the Event API (aka the Insights API). Or, go directly to the full online course Custom data. Requirements For Event API limits and restricted attributes, see Limits. Ensure outbound connectivity on TCP port 443 is allowed to the CIDR range that matches your region. The preferred configuration method is to use the DNS name insights-collector.newrelic.com or insights-collector.eu01.nr-data.net. Basic workflow The Event API is an asynchronous endpoint. This allows you to send a very large volume of POSTS, reliably, with very low response latency. Tip If your account hosts data in the EU data center, ensure you are using the proper API endpoints for EU region accounts. To send a custom event to a New Relic account: Get a license key for the account you want to report data to. Before creating custom events or attributes, review New Relic's list of reserved terms used by NRQL. Generate JSON for the event by instrumenting your application, querying an API, or some other method. Submit a compressed JSON payload (for example, gzip or deflate) to the HTTPS endpoint using curl in a POST request. Recommendation: Set up NRQL alert conditions to notify you when parsing errors occur. This method will send the events directly into your account, where they will be accessible from any NRQL interface or with the Query API. The Event API limits the size, rate, and characters allowed in custom events. Also, like other events available in NRQL, custom events cannot be updated or deleted after they are created. If you have problems with your custom event, follow the troubleshooting procedures or create a new custom event. Get the license key You'll need a license key. License keys are associated with an account, not a specific user. This means that anyone in the account with access to that key can use it. You can submit multiple event types to the same account with the same license key. However, to help ensure security, we recommend that you use different keys for different applications or data sources. Alternatively, you can use an Insights insert keyfor this API, but we recommend using a license key. Format the JSON The Event API accepts specific formats for attributes included in the payload. Only float or string values are allowed. JSON format guidelines When defining attributes for your custom events, follow these JSON format guidelines. Attributes JSON format guidelines eventType Required: The event's name. Float and string values Float value format: \"label\":value String value format: \"label\":\"value\" Data types The API only accepts key-value pairs, not map/object or array values. Supported data types for this API are strings and numbers (integers or floats). For more information, see Data requirements. Digits in strings For performance-related reasons, we do not cast values submitted to the API. For example, we treat 123 as a number and \"123\" as a string. The database will only store up to 64 bit numbers. Any numbers larger than 64 bits will be truncated. Dates For attributes that contain date information, use an unformatted Unix timestamp in the Insights data formatter. You can define the date attribute either in seconds or in milliseconds, both relative to the Unix epoch. Time Unless otherwise specified, the timestamp for a submitted event is the time it was submitted to New Relic. To specify a different time for the event, use the timestamp attribute. JSON example Here is an example of a typical JSON data set for sending with the API. This call sends two Purchase type events as a JSON array. You can add multiple events in a single HTTP call using a JSON array. [ { \"eventType\":\"Purchase\", \"account\":3, \"amount\":259.54 }, { \"eventType\":\"Purchase\", \"account\":5, \"amount\":12309, \"product\":\"Item\" } ] Copy When generating the JSON, make sure your attributes are properly formatted. Limits and restricted characters The following size and rate limits apply to events sent via the Event API: Max events per API call: 2K Payload total size: 1MB(10^6 bytes) maximum per POST. We highly recommend using compression. The payload must be encoded as UTF-8. Number of attributes per event: 255 maximum Length of attribute name: 255 characters Length of attribute value: 4096 maximum character length There are rate limits on the number of HTTP requests per minute sent to the Event API. Some specific attributes have additional restrictions: accountId: This is a reserved attribute name. If it is included, it will be dropped during ingest. entity.guid, entity.name, and entity.type: These attributes are used internally to identify entities. Any values submitted with these keys in the attributes section of a metric data point may cause undefined behavior such as missing entities in the UI or telemetry not associating with the expected entities. For more information please refer to Entity synthesis. appId: Value must be an integer. If it is not an integer, the attribute name and value will be dropped during ingest. eventType: Can be a combination of alphanumeric characters, _ underscores, and : colons. timestamp: Must be a Unix epoch timestamp. You can define timestamps either in seconds or in milliseconds. Submit the custom event Data submitted to the Event API uses a compressed JSON format in a simple HTTPS POST request. This example uses gzip, but you can also use deflate. Linux/bash example gzip -c example_events.json | curl -X POST -H \"Content-Type: application/json\" -H \"Api-Key: YOUR_LICENSE_KEY\" -H \"Content-Encoding: gzip\" https://insights-collector.newrelic.com/v1/accounts/YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID/events --data-binary @- Copy Windows/PowerShell example $accountId = \"YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID\" $insertkey = \"YOUR_LICENSE_KEY\" # Replace with your custom event for the body $body = '[{\"eventType\": \"powershell\", \"account\": 4, \"amount\": 123, \"fileLocation\": \"c:\\\\temp2\", \"zipped\": \"true\" }]' $headers = @{} $headers.Add(\"Api-Key\", \"$insertkey\") $headers.Add(\"Content-Encoding\", \"gzip\") $encoding = [System.Text.Encoding]::UTF8 $enc_data = $encoding.GetBytes($body) $output = [System.IO.MemoryStream]::new() $gzipStream = New-Object System.IO.Compression.GzipStream $output, ([IO.Compression.CompressionMode]::Compress) $gzipStream.Write($enc_data, 0, $enc_data.Length) $gzipStream.Close() $gzipBody = $output.ToArray() Invoke-WebRequest -Headers $headers -Method Post -Body $gzipBody \"https://insights-collector.newrelic.com/v1/accounts/$accountId/events\" Copy Important Always use compression with every payload. This allows you to send more data, and it saves resources during parsing. Before generating your HTTP request, make sure it is properly formatted, including: The Api-Key contains the correct license key. The Content-Type is application/json. The request uses POST only. The API does not accept PUT and GET requests. The API supports HTTP/1.1 persistent connections. This is helpful to manage client-side performance under heavy event loads. Verify or troubleshoot request response The Event API follows a two-step process to process requests: The Event API synchronously acknowledges or rejects the request based on validation of the headers and payload size. The Event API asynchronously parses the payload after a successful HTTP response is provided to the client. This may generate an error due to missing or malformed data. These are classified as submission errors or parsing errors. All successful submissions receive a 200 response, regardless of any data errors that may exist within the payload. The response includes a uuid, which is a unique ID created for each request. The uuid also appears in any error events created for the request. Other potential issues: 10-second timeout: API calls exceeding 10 seconds will time out. Large payloads: Payloads exceeding 100 KB may see increased response times. Recommendation: In addition to checking for a success message, create a NRQL query of your data to verify it's available. Success response code Success message Comments 200 {\"success\":true,\"uuid\":\"xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx\"} Copy Submission errors Payloads with submission errors are handled and returned to the sender through an HTTP response code. To troubleshoot payload submission errors, refer to these HTTP response codes. Submission errors Troubleshooting 400 Missing or invalid content length: Unable to process empty request. 403 Missing or invalid key: Invalid license key. Register a valid license key. 408 Request timed out: Request took too long to process. 413 Content too large: Request is too large to process. Refer to the limits and restricted characters to troubleshoot. 415 Invalid content type: Must be application/JSON. The Event API accepts any content type except multi-part/related and assumes it can be parsed to JSON. 429 Too many requests due to rate limiting. 503 Service temporarily unavailable: Retry request Parsing errors Parsing errors occur if: An event is sent within a payload, but it is either missing data or is exceeding maximum limits. New Relic will drop the individual event from the payload, generate an NrIntegrationError event, and process the rest. The JSON payload includes malformed JSON or missing required data. Payloads with parsing errors receive a 200 response to indicate a successful submission. To help resolve parsing errors, a new NrIntegrationError event type is created. All parsing errors are due to NRQL queries. For error messages related to dropped events, New Relic will include the number of events that were dropped as part of the message. To troubleshoot requests with parsing errors, refer to these error messages. Parsing errors Troubleshooting X event(s) rejected because attribute appId was not an integer An appId attribute has a non-integer value, such as a decimal value or string. X event(s) rejected because eventType cannot contain the following characters: [., \\] An eventType attributed included an invalid character, such as a period or backslash. X event(s) rejected because attribute is missing attribute name An attribute name was set to null or an empty string. X event(s) rejected because attribute name exceeded maximum length An attribute name has more than 255 characters. X event(s) rejected because attribute value exceeded maximum length An attribute value was longer than 4096 characters. X event(s) rejected because event exceeded maximum number of attributes An event has more than 255 attributes. X event(s) rejected because missing required attributes eventType The eventType attribute is required for the custom event. Error parsing JSON payload There was an error parsing the request JSON because of formatting problems or corrupted data. Query and alert with NrIntegrationError The NrIntegrationError event allows you to query and set alerts on custom data being sent to your New Relic account. Recommendation: To get alerts for parsing errors, create a NRQL alert condition for NrIntegrationError. Use this example NRQL query: SELECT message FROM NrIntegrationError WHERE newRelicFeature = 'Event API' AND category = 'EventApiException' Copy NrIntegrationError attributes Troubleshooting timestamp The timestamp when the request was received. The timestamp attribute takes a 64-bit integer Unix timestamp within the last 24 hours. You can define timestamps either in seconds or in milliseconds, both relative to the Unix epoch. Do not use a decimal for the timestamp. If a decimal is used, the attribute will default to the timestamp when the custom event was created. newRelicFeature The name of the feature experiencing errors. For all custom event parsing errors, this will be Event API. apiKeyPrefix The first six characters of the license key used for the request that generated an error. requestId The uuid returned by the the API for the request that generated an error. Category The category of the error. For custom events, this is EventApiException. Message Contents of the error message. Name The error's name. For custom events, this is always EventValidationException. eventTypeSample One of the event types that generated the error, when available. Find your data To find data sent via the Event API (and from integrations that use this API), you can query it. For example, to query a custom event using NRQL, you would run: SELECT * FROM YOUR_CUSTOM_EVENT Copy For more on how to query, see Query data. Limit on HTTP requests The Event API has a rate limit of 100,000 HTTP requests (POSTs) per minute, per account. (Note that this is not a limit on the number of events per minute; only on the number of POSTs per minute.) This limit helps ensure that large traffic spikes in accounts across our multi-tenant platform do not negatively affect how the service performs for you. If your API usage exceeds 100k POSTs in a 1-minute window, we will reject subsequent API requests with a 429 response code for the remainder of the 1-minute window. At the end of the 1-minute window, the counter will be reset and allow traffic to resume. This limit is intended to be an upper threshold that you shouldn't hit under normal scenarios. If you have a high number of 429 responses, consider using the API less. If you are expecting a higher-than-normal activity level in the near future and want to prepare for that, contact technical support.",

      "body": "You can drop data you don't want to keep by changing the remote_write section of the YAML config file. Tip You can also drop remote write data using NerdGraph. For more information, see Drop data using NerdGraph. Drop entire metric data points from remote write integration If a target is sending a noisy metric that you don't want sent to New Relic, you can specify that New Relic should drop that data. Example Let's say you don't want to receive data for the metric node_memory_active_bytes from an instance running at localhost:9100. Using the write_relabel_config entry shown below, you can target the metric name using the __name__ label in combination with the instance name. remote_write: - url: https://metric-api.newrelic.com/prometheus/v1/write?prometheus_server=macbook-server-cluster bearer_token: <redacted> write_relabel_configs: - source_labels: ['__name__', 'instance'] regex: 'node_memory_active_bytes;localhost:9100' action: 'drop' Copy This tells Prometheus that you want to do some action against metrics with these labels. To limit which metrics with these labels are affected, you must include some value for regex. By default this value is set to .* and it will include all metrics. In this case, it will drop all metric data points coming out of Prometheus via remote write. Drop specific labels or attributes from data points If a target is sending specific labels or attributes you're not interested in receiving, you can drop these from the metrics you receive. Example Let's say one of your targets is sending a bunch of extra attributes you're not interested in receiving. These might include things like high cardinality attributes such as unique machine identifiers, JVM IDs, or similar. In this case, you need to change both the remote_write and the scrape_configs section of the YAML file. The result will look something like this: remote_write: - url: https://metric-api.newrelic.com/prometheus/v1/write?prometheus_server=macbook-server-cluster bearer_token: <redacted> write_relabel_configs: - regex: 'extraLabelToRemove.*' action: 'labeldrop' ... scrape_configs: # The job name is added as a label `job=<job_name>` to any timeseries scraped from this config. - job_name: 'node' # Override the global default and scrape targets from this job every 5 seconds. scrape_interval: 5s static_configs: - targets: ['localhost:9100'] labels: group: 'production' keepLabelName1: 'please-keep-me' extraLabelToRemove: 'please-remove-me' extraLabelToRemove1: 'please-remove-me' extraLabelToRemove2: 'please-remove-me' extraLabelToRemove4: 'please-remove-me' extraLabelToRemove3: 'please-remove-me' extraLabelToRemove5: 'please-remove-me' Copy Prometheus or NerdGraph? There are advantages to both dropping data using the method described on this page and using NerdGraph. This section is intended to help you figure out which method is better for your specific needs and preferences. Considerations for the Prometheus config file method With this method, your dropped data never leaves the associated Prometheus instance. This is a valuable feature if bytes transferred is a cost consideration on the app hosting side. However, this method may be less appealing than the NerdGraph option due to the following considerations: Maintained via config yaml files that need to be loaded onto each Prometheus instance (or via a shared storage mechanism) Requires access to Prometheus server, meaning that either: The server needs to be restarted Served must be be accessed at port with path /-/reload (assuming the server has lifecycle management enabled as described here in the Prometheus configuration docs. Considerations the NerdGraph method NerdGraph is a great option if you want to manage all your data dropping in a single place. It can also be updated easily via the API and requires no restart or interaction with Prometheus. However, this method applies rules to all incoming data points. This means that you should set up your rules with careful consideration using WHERE filtering. For more information, see Drop data using NerdGraph.

Better cost, performance, and compliance Collecting and storing data in New Relic allows you to analyze, visualize, and alert on all your metrics, events, logs, and traces from across all of your sources. However, it’s important to manage that data for cost, performance, and in some cases, compliance reasons. The data management hub provides the tools you need to understand and control where your data is coming from, and adjust what’s stored and for how long. Important If you're on our original product-based pricing plan, you'll see your data ingest, retention, and limits in the Data management hub. The primary difference is that you're not billed on ingest, as with our New Relic One pricing plan. Not sure which plan you're on? See Overview of pricing and user model. Cost management The cost of data storage continually decreases, but storage is still an expense. The amount of data you process and store is closely related to the value you receive from New Relic, because it’s a key component of how you’re charged. Our ingest process helps you hone your data. For example, data might arrive at our processing front door compressed and of varying quality. Through ingest, that data is uncompressed, decorated with queryable attributes, and evaluated. Elements are dropped or trimmed, all before we write it to NRDB. That way, the data you store is only the data you want most.

Want to try out our Metric API? Create a New Relic account for free! No credit card required. What is the Metric API? The Metric API is a way to get metric data into New Relic. The API works by sending a POST request to our HTTP endpoint with a JSON payload containing the metric data. The Metric API is how metrics are ingested from some of our integrations, including our open source exporters (like DropWizard, OpenCensus, and Prometheus). The Metric API is also used by our Telemetry SDKs, which are language-specific tools that make it easier to use our data-ingest APIs. The Metric API can be used to: Report metric data to New Relic without a New Relic agent. Integrate metric data from an open source or in-house developed tool, library, or framework. Fully control the metric data you're sending, including the resolution and associated dimensions. Leverage the power of NRQL, New Relic's query language, for querying your metric data. Set up alerts for your metric data. Requirements Ensure outbound connectivity on TCP port 443 is allowed to the CIDR range that matches your region. The preferred configuration method is to use the DNS name metric-api.newrelic.com or metric-api.eu.newrelic.com. You'll need a New Relic license key for the New Relic account you want to send data to. For information on limits and restricted attributes, see Metric API requirements and limits. Get started If we don't have an existing integration that meets your metric-reporting needs, you have two options: Use our Telemetry SDKs, which are language-specific tools that help you send us metrics and other data. Use the Metric API directly. Find and use your data You can find data sent via the Metric API (including from integrations that use this API) in these locations: From one.newrelic.com, select Explorer and look for your service. By querying the Metric data type. For example, you can use NRQL to run: SELECT * FROM Metric Copy For more on querying, see Metric query examples. For information on querying in general, see Query data. Alert on metric data To alert on metrics created with the Metric API, use NRQL alert conditions: Select the NRQL category when defining your condition, then use the FROM Metric ... NRQL query syntax to express it. When you create these alert conditions, Alerts automatically uses the finest granularity data available (the raw metric data points) to evaluate alerts. Data retention All raw metric data points will be retained for 30 days. All additional aggregated data derived from the raw metric data points (for example, one-minute rollups) will be retained for 13 months. Any change to the retention period beyond such periods may result in a charge to you. Troubleshooting See Troubleshoot an NrIntegrationError event.",

      "body": "Use the Metric API to send custom metrics to the New Relic platform. This document includes a quick start to send your first custom metric, plus detailed information on how to format and send your metric data. Quick start: Send metric data We report the metric types count, gauge, and summary. For more information on metrics see our documentation. Metric data is submitted to New Relic through an HTTP POST request. Each request is composed of one or more metric data points, which consist of a metric name, a timestamp, and a value. Follow this example to send your first metric data points to New Relic: Get the license key for the account you want to report data to. Insert the license key into the following JSON, and then send the JSON to our endpoint. This example creates a single metric data point for a metric named memory.heap, but you can create additional attributes or data points by specifying metric types or adding optional common blocks. curl -vvv -k -H \"Content-Type: application/json\" \\ -H \"Api-Key: NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY\" \\ -X POST https://metric-api.newrelic.com/metric/v1 \\ --data '[{ \"metrics\":[{ \"name\":\"memory.heap\", \"type\":\"gauge\", \"value\":2.3, \"timestamp\":CURRENT_TIME, \"attributes\":{\"host.name\":\"dev.server.com\"} }] }]' Copy The metric should be available in New Relic in a few seconds. You can query the data from any NRQL interface using this query: FROM Metric SELECT max(memory.heap) TIMESERIES Copy For more on where data shows up, see Find Metric API data. Endpoint URL Use an HTTP POST when sending metric data to the metric API endpoint: https://metric-api.newrelic.com/metric/v1 Copy Tip If your account hosts data in the EU data center, ensure you're using the proper API endpoints for EU region accounts. HTTP request headers Include the following HTTP request headers with the POST request. You can send some parameters as query parameters instead of request headers. Header Send as a query parameter? Details Content-Type No Required. Must be application/json. Content-Length No Required (usually set automatically by the HTTP client). The length of the request body in octets (8-bit bytes) unless sent with chunked encoding. This header is generally set by default by the underlying HTTP client sending the data and in most cases should not require any additional effort by the end user. Api-Key Yes Required. A license key for the account you want to report data to. If this is provided as both a header and a query parameter, the values must match. Content-Encoding No Required if GZIP. The value must be GZIP or Identity. If no value is present, then Identity is assumed. x-request-id No Optional - Reserved for future use. The value must be a valid UUID4. The value is expected to be unique for each request. HTTP request body The body of the HTTP POST request must be in JSON format. The following describes the requirements and recommendations for the JSON payload. The payload must be encoded as UTF-8. Structure The JSON payload uses this structure: The JSON payload is an array of maps. Each map must contain a metrics key whose value is an array containing one or more metric data points. A metric data point is identified by a name, value, and timestamp along with an optional set of attributes. JSON payload creating two metrics This example payload creates two metrics. service.errors.all is a count metric with three attributes and service.memory is a gauge metric with two attributes. [ { \"metrics\": [ { \"name\": \"service.errors.all\", \"type\": \"count\", \"value\": 15, \"timestamp\": [CURRENT_TIME](#optional-map-attributes), \"interval.ms\": 10000, \"attributes\": { \"service.response.statuscode\": \"400\", \"host.name\": \"dev.server.com\", \"service.name\": \"foo\" } }, { \"name\": \"service.memory\", \"type\": \"gauge\", \"value\": 2.7, \"timestamp\": CURRENT_TIME, \"attributes\": { \"host.name\": \"dev.server.com\", \"app.name\": \"foo\" } } ] } ] Copy Required key-value pairs Each metric data point map in the metrics array uses the following key-value structure: Key Description name string Required. The name of the metric. The value must be less than 255 characters. value number or map Required. The value varies depending on the metric type. For gauge and count the value should be a single number. For summary, the value should be a map with key-value pairs specifying the count, sum, min, and max. timestamp long Required. The metric's start time in Unix time. Defaults to the current time in UTC timezone. This field also support seconds, microseconds, and nanoseconds. However, the data will be converted to milliseconds for storage and query. Metrics reported with a timestamp older than 48 hours ago or newer than 24 hours from the time they are reported are dropped. interval.ms positive long Required for count and summary metric types. The length of the time window. type Recommended. This should be one of the supported metric types. If you do not specify a type, then this will default to a gauge. attributes strings, JSON numbers, or booleans Recommended. A map of key value pairs associated with this specific metric. Values can be strings, JSON numbers, or booleans. Keys are case-sensitive and must be less than 255 characters. JSON payload with three metric types Here's an example payload containing one metric data point for each metric type: [ { \"metrics\": [ { \"name\": \"cache.misses\", \"type\": \"count\", \"value\": 15, \"timestamp\": [CURRENT_TIME](#optional-map-attributes), \"interval.ms\": 10000, \"attributes\": { \"cache.name\": \"myCache\", \"host.name\": \"dev.server.com\" } }, { \"name\": \"temperature\", \"type\": \"gauge\", \"value\": 15, \"timestamp\": CURRENT_TIME, \"attributes\": { \"city\": \"Portland\", \"state\": \"Oregon\" } }, { \"name\": \"service.response.duration\", \"type\": \"summary\", \"value\": { \"count\": 5, \"sum\": 0.004382655, \"min\": 0.0005093, \"max\": 0.001708826 }, \"interval.ms\": 10000, \"timestamp\": CURRENT_TIME, \"attributes\": { \"host.name\": \"dev.server.com\", \"app.name\": \"foo\" } } ] } ] Copy Share attributes across metrics with common If you want to include a set of attributes on multiple metrics (and not add the same attributes for each metric), you can use the common block. This is an optional map that specifies information that applies to all associated metric data points. Values in the common section will be overridden if the same key exists on a metric data point. The block can include: Attribute Description timestamp long The metric's start time in Unix time. This defaults to the current time in the UTC timezone. This field also supports seconds, microseconds, and nanoseconds. However, the data will be converted to milliseconds for storage and later querying. interval.ms positive long Required for count and summary.The length of the time window. attributes strings, JSON numbers, or booleans A map of key-value pairs associated with this specific metric. Values can be strings, JSON numbers, or booleans. Example of common attributes In the following example payload, three metrics are sent. All three metrics share app.name and host.name attributes, specified in the common block. Each metric also has a unique value for another attribute, server.response.statuscode. [ { \"common\" : { \"timestamp\": 1531414060739, \"interval.ms\": 10000, \"attributes\": { \"app.name\": \"foo\", \"host.name\": \"dev.server.com\" } }, \"metrics\": [ { \"name\": \"service.errors.all\", \"type\": \"count\", \"value\": 9, \"attributes\": { \"service.response.statuscode\": \"400\" } }, { \"name\": \"service.errors.all\", \"type\": \"count\", \"value\": 4, \"attributes\": { \"service.response.statuscode\": \"500\" } }, { \"name\": \"service.response.duration\", \"type\": \"summary\", \"value\": { \"count\": 5, \"sum\": 0.004382655, \"min\": 0.0005093, \"max\": 0.001708826 }, \"attributes\": { \"service.response.statuscode\": \"200\" } } ] } ] Copy Response validation and status codes The Metric API returns a 202 response code for successful requests. When your data is accepted, an HTTP 202 response code is returned with a response structure like this: HTTP/1.1 202 Accepted Content-Type: application/json; charset=UTF-8 Content-Length: 52 Access-Control-Allow-Methods: GET, POST, PUT, HEAD, OPTIONS Access-Control-Allow-Credentials: true Access-Control-Allow-Origin: * Connection: keep-alive {\"requestId\":\"f0e7bfff-001a-b000-0000-01682bcf4565\"} Copy Missing data with 202 response A 202 code indicates the API did receive your data, and that the data passed basic validation checks. Normally, your data will be available for querying within a few seconds. However, New Relic runs additional validation asynchronously after receiving your data. If you receive a 202 response but can't find your metric, this indicates that New Relic found an error during this asynchronous validation. You can find these errors by querying NrIntegrationError events in the account associated with the Insert API key you used. The requestId for each request will be tagged on the NrIntegrationError event. For more information, see Troubleshoot an NRIntegrationError event. Status codes The Metric API can return the following HTTP status codes: Status code Definition 202 Data accepted. 400 Structure of the request is invalid. 403 Authentication failure. 404 The request path is incorrect. 405 Used a request method other than POST. 408 The request took too long to reach the endpoint. 411 The Content-Length header wasn’t included. 413 The payload was too big. Payloads must be under 1MB (10^6 bytes). 414 The request URI was too long. 415 The Content-Type or Content-Encoding was invalid. 429 The request rate quota has been exceeded. 431 The request headers are too long. 5xx There was a server error (please retry).",

      "body": "NerdGraph is our GraphQL-format API that lets you query New Relic data and configure some New Relic features. What is NerdGraph? New Relic has several APIs. NerdGraph is the API we recommend for querying New Relic data and for performing some specific configurations (learn more about features). NerdGraph provides a single API interface for returning data from New Relic’s various APIs and microservices. Over time, other configuration capabilities will be added to NerdGraph. Important NerdGraph isn’t used for data ingest. For that, you'd use our data ingest APIs. NerdGraph is built using GraphQL, which is an open source API format that allows you to request exactly the data needed, with no over-fetching or under-fetching. For a lesson in how to use NerdGraph, watch this 7-minute video: Want to watch more video tutorials? Go to the New Relic University’s Intro to NerdGraph. Or see the online course on New Relic APIs. Use the GraphiQL explorer To get started using GraphQL, we recommend playing around with our GraphiQL explorer (GraphiQL is an open source graphical interface for using GraphQL). You can use it to explore our data schema, to read built-in object definitions, and to build and execute queries. To use GraphQL, you’ll need a user-specific New Relic API key called a user key. You can generate one or find an existing one from the GraphiQL explorer’s API key dropdown. To find the GraphiQL explorer: If your New Relic account uses an EU data center, go to api.eu.newrelic.com/graphiql. Otherwise use api.newrelic.com/graphiql. For tips on how to build queries, see Build queries. Requirements and endpoints To use NerdGraph, you need a New Relic user key, which can be generated and accessed from the GraphiQL explorer. The endpoints are: Main endpoint: https://api.newrelic.com/graphql Endpoint for accounts using EU data center: https://api.eu.newrelic.com/graphql To access the endpoint, use the following cURL command: curl -X POST https://api.newrelic.com/graphql \\ -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \\ -H 'API-Key: YOUR_NEW_RELIC_USER_KEY' \\ -d '{ \"query\": \"{ requestContext { userId apiKey } }\" } ' Copy What can you do with NerdGraph? NerdGraph functionality can be broken down into two main categories: Querying New Relic data. You can fetch data for a variety of purposes, including using it in a programmatic workflow, or building a New Relic One app for custom data visualizations. Configuring New Relic features. There are a variety of configurations available and more will be added over time. You can do things like add tags, configure workloads, or customize \"golden metrics.\" You can use NerdGraph to return a wide range of New Relic data but we’ve created some tutorials for common use cases: Topic Tutorials Your monitored entities Get data about entities Understand entity relationships and dependencies (used to build service maps) Query and configure \"golden metrics\" (important entity metrics) Querying data Query using NRQL (our query language) Tags Add and manage tags Dashboards Create dashboards Export dashboards to other accounts Export dashboards as files Migrate from Insights Dashboard API to NerdGraph Alerts See all alert-related tutorials Applied Intelligence View and configure topology Workloads View and configure workloads Manage keys Create and manage keys (license keys used for data ingest, and user keys) Manage data Convert event data to metric data Drop data Distributed tracing Query distributed tracing data Configure Infinite Tracing New Relic One apps Build a New Relic One app Cloud integrations (AWS, Azure, GCP) Configure cloud integrations Partners and resellers Manage subscriptions (only for partners using original pricing plan) Data partitions Manage data partitions Date retention Manage data retention NerdGraph terminology The following are terms that originate with GraphQL (the API format NerdGraph uses). Term Definition Queries and mutations There are two classes of GraphQL operations: Queries are basic requests used only to fetch data. These queries are not static, meaning that you can ask for more data or less data, depending on your needs. For each query, you can specify exactly what data you want to retrieve, as long as it is supported by the schema. Mutations are requests that perform an action, such as creating a resource or changing configuration. Mutations require the keyword mutation, as well as the name of the mutation. Type Data in GraphQL is organized into types. Types can be scalars (like strings, numbers, or booleans) or object types. An object type is a custom type made up of a collection of fields. For example, an object type called User may represent a user in a system. Field A field represents a piece of information on an object type that can be queried. Fields can be scalars, lists, or objects. For example, a User object type could have a string field called name. Interface An interface is an abstract type that represents a collection of common fields that other object types can implement. Tips on using the GraphiQL explorer You can make queries with the NerdGraph GraphiQL explorer. The explorer provides built-in schema definitions and features, including auto-complete and query validation. Query accounts a New Relic user can access You can query for the name of an account that an actor (a New Relic authorized user) has access to: query { actor { account(id: YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID) { name } } } Copy The response will mirror the query structure you defined in the request, making it easy to ask for the specific data that you want. { \"data\": { \"actor\": { \"account\": { \"name\": \"Data Nerd\" } } } } Copy Query user, account, and NRQL in one request The graph structure shows its capabilities when queries become more complex. For example, you can query for user information, account information, and make a NRQL query with one request. With REST API, this would take three different requests to three different endpoints. query { actor { account(id: YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID) { name nrql(query: \"SELECT * FROM Transaction\") { results } } user { name id } } } Copy",

      "body": "Important This doc is for accounts on our original pricing plan, not our New Relic One pricing plan. Not sure which you're on? See Overview of pricing plans. For organizations on New Relic One pricing, our various New Relic products report a wide range of event data. Different products have different data retention periods, and different ways to extend event data retention. You can customize the length of your event data retention through flexible event retention. Data retention UI For how to find the data retention UI, see Manage data. Overview of event data retention All New Relic product subscriptions come with a certain level of data retention that governs how long different types of data are retained. One type of data governed by data retention rules is event data. Event data is available in some UI charts and tables, and also available for querying via NRQL, our querying language. There are events reported from products by default, and there are custom events: each have their own retention rules, depending on the product and subscription level. Here are some examples of how different product subscriptions can affect event data retention: Free/Lite APM subscription: default-reported events available for 1 day. No custom events available. Pro APM subscription: default-reported events available for 8 days. Custom events available for 1 day (and able to be extended with Insight Pro). To see your subscriptions, go to the Account summary page. Extend your event retention Product Method APM, Browser, and Mobile Event data retention can be extended with a paid subscription to these products (see product data retention). To extend retention of both default-reported events and custom events further, you need an Insights Pro subscription. Infrastructure Event data retention can be extended with a paid Infrastructure subscription. See Infrastructure data retention rules. Synthetics Event data retention can be extended with a paid Synthetics subscription. See Synthetics data retention rules. Custom events Custom events reported by agent APIs or the Event API: Extension requires an Insights Pro subscription. Insights Pro Important As of April 12, 2021, we are upgrading Insights to an improved web and mobile experience! All of your Insights URLs will be redirected automatically to the corresponding dashboards in New Relic One. For more details about this migration and how you can easily plan for this transition, see our Explorers Hub post. A paid Insights subscription is what governs the extension of event data retention for: Our APM, Browser, Mobile, and Serverless products Custom events that come from an agent API or from the Event API Important Note that having an Insights Pro subscription doesn't require use of the Insights UI (insights.newrelic.com) to query your data: there are other querying options available. To see the data retention governed by your Insights subscription: go to the usage UI and select Insights usage. With an Insights Pro subscription, you can use flexible retention to customize how your event data is retained. This lets you keep only the data you need, for as long as you need it. How number of events stored is calculated This is an explanation of how the number of stored events are calculated by default for an Insights Pro subscription. (Note that with flexible retention, you have more fine-grained control over the retention period.) The events stored is calculated based on 1) total events stored over time (calculated based on the events generated per week) and 2) the weeks of data retention available. This equation can be represented like this: events stored = (events generated per week) * (weeks of retention) Copy An Insights Pro subscription provides a given number of weeks of data retention as well as a given number of events over that retention period. For example: (200M transactions per week) * (4 weeks of retention) = 800M events stored in Insights (16M transactions per week) * (50 weeks of retention) = 800M events stored in Insights For Insights Pro subscriptions, data is purged based on retention window, not volume. It is deleted from the system once it's past the retention window. For example: If your Insights license is for 800 million events with a 4 week retention period, your data would start being purged after it is older than four weeks. Temporary spikes in data exceeding your subscription level will still be recorded, but consistent overage should be solved by upgrading your subscription level or decreasing data collected. For customers without an Insights Pro subscription, New Relic may throttle or downsample events to a limit of not more than than 4,000 events per host per minute. Insights Pro event overage example In this example, you have an Insights Pro subscription with a license for 800 million events over 4 weeks, a rate of 200 million events per week. You have APM Pro, Browser Pro, and Mobile Enterprise. A fifth week of data is added via your subscriptions, bumping you to a total of 1 billion events stored within your plan: If you are using 975 million events, you are not over your retention. If you are using 1.25 billion events, you are over your retention. Disable/enable Transaction and Pageview event reporting Tip Owners or Admins The Insights Data summary UI page is used to see the types of events being reported. You can also use this page to enable and disable the reporting of PageView and Transaction events. To view Data summary: Go to insights.newrelic.com > Manage data. Select the Summary tab. Note: if you disable PageView or Transaction event reporting, this can affect some New Relic UI elements. You may see some empty charts on some UI pages that rely on this data. Go to insights.newrelic.com > Manage data > Summary. From the Summary tab, select Configure data sources. Toggle the appropriate switch on or off, then save. Toggling Transaction on or off will cause reporting agents to restart themselves. For more about configuring event reporting, see Event data retention. Flexible data retention With an Insights Pro subscription, you get access to flexible retention, which lets you define how some types of event data are retained. This lets you keep only the event data you need, for as long as you need it. You can manage your flexible retention through the UI or through our GraphQL API. Requirements to use this feature: An Insights Pro subscription or equivalent trial. Applies only for events governed by an Insights Pro subscription. To use this feature, you must be an account Owner or data retention add-on manager for your account. How it works To understand how standard event data retention works, first read Event data retention. With flexible retention, you specify the data retention for applicable event namespaces across your accounts. This gives you per-event namespace control of your data. The retention that you specify for an event namespace will be shared by all the event types under that namespace. If some namespaces are not relevant to you, you can avoid collecting their event data entirely. Your retention value can’t be lower than the included retention or higher than the default retention. You can control data retention either in our UI or by API. Manage retention via UI You can control data retention either using our GraphQL API or in the UI. To do this with the UI, go to the data retention UI. Your retention changes take effect within 24 hours after updating. Glossary To understand the terms used with flexible retention, see the following: Term Description Event namespace An event's namespace corresponds to one or more event types that share a single data retention value. For more information, see Event namespaces (types). You can also use NerdGraph to get the list of customizable event namespaces. Retention value The number (in days) that specifies how long your event data is stored. Retention rule The event namespace and retention value pair that you specify to override the current retention. Licensed retention Retention period that’s determined in weeks by your Insights Pro subscription contract. Included retention Retention period for which your data is stored but not charged under the Insights Pro subscription. For details, see the data retention details for a specific product. Paid retention Retention period for which your data is stored and is charged under the Insights Pro subscription. By default, your licensed retention determines this value but Flexible retention lets you override it. Default retention Retention period that comes out of the box. This is based on the total of included retention plus licensed retention. For information on managing retention settings with APIs, see the Manage data retention documentation. For more help For details about the data retention of other products or integrations, see that specific documentation.",

      "body": "When you connect your data to New Relic, we process what we receive and apply data dropping and transformation rules. Then we count the bytes needed to represent your data in a standard format, like JSON. If you're on our New Relic One pricing plan, you're charged by the number of bytes written to our database, above and beyond the standard amount that’s free. Important This doc is for accounts on our New Relic One pricing plan. If you're on our original product-based pricing plan, see Original data retention. Not sure which you're on? See Overview of pricing and user model. The Data ingestion page shows your ingest rates for a period you specify on the top-right of the Data management hub. Since 30 days ago is the default setting, but you can also set a custom date span. The page shows your daily average GBs, and the total for the range you set. You can toggle between an overall ingest view and an account view to identify which of your accounts are sending the most data. The page also provides the current month-to-date, and the projected end-of-month total ingest rates. With this information, you can proactively drop data or turn off agents in order to manage ingest and, therefore, costs. If you want to take a look at how we query the data, click the ellipsis icon (just above the chart) to slide out the chart query and open it in our query builder. And If you want to drill down further into your data usage, check out the sample queries in the usage docs. From the Login drop-down, select Manage your data, and then select Data ingestion. This is the Data ingestion page with data source and account views. Data ingestion sources The Data ingestion page describes which of your data sources provide the most data on average and during specific data ranges. The sources are described here. Billable data sources Description Timeslices (1-minute) and Metric:Raw Metrics are timeslices + MetricRaw Metric group: MetricsBytes Metric timeslice data averages to one-hour periods after eight days. After 90 days, the permanent metric data continues to be stored in one-hour periods. We currently store the raw metric data for 30 days. You are only billed for the initial ingest volume. You are not billed for subsequent rollups.

This way, you'll know your baselines, and can more easily spot an anomaly like an ingest spike, as well as its source. To break down your ingested data, start from the chart on the Data ingestion page. Think of the data source bands as the Y axis, and the dates as the X axis. Click on the band you want to inspect at the spot in the X axis that corresponds with the date you want to investigate. This image shows the Metrics band for June 15 right before it's clicked. A modal opens with the account, data source, and facet selected. You can do a handful of things on this page: Change the account, data source, or facet you want to drill down into. Change the date and time to investigate. Review the results of the query in chart form. The chart displays the top 15 results for the facet query. Open the NRQL query in the Query builder where you'll find additional facets that you can use. Learn more about NRQL queries here. How we break your ingest data down Some of the content in the UI is variable, depending on your account. This information is intended to help you understand how we're working with your ingest data. The chart on the Data ingestion page shows data usage for a little longer time frame than that covered by your retention settings for each data ingest source. If you choose a date outside of your designated retention period for an ingest source, you'll get the message that there's no chart data available. Select a more recent date to fix this problem. If you inspect a data source for an account that has less than a terrabyte of data, we compute the ingest volume over a 24 hour period; otherwise, we compute it for a 1 hour period. The ingest value provided on the main Data ingestion chart will be slightly different from that reflected during inspection. This is because our facet computation is an estimate. Set alerts for data use Query and alert on usage data describes how to set alerts to get notified if you're nearing data ingest limits you don't want to cross. For example, you might set an alert on logs, which can stack up quickly in an active system. Adjust your data ingest Drop data for lower retention costs and data compliance On ingest, we apply data dropping rules so you won't be charged for data that's not useful. Learn how to set additional data dropping rules yourself. Use NerdGraph to drop entire data types or drop data attributes from data types so they’re not written to NRDB. This enables you to focus on the data you want, reduces retention costs, and avoids writing sensitive data to the database. For dropping log data, see Drop data with drop filter rules. Turn off agents and integrations If you don’t need data from specific agents or integrations that you have installed, you can uninstall/delete those tools. For instructions, see the specific documentation for an agent or integration.",

Want to try out our Metric API? Create a New Relic account for free! No credit card required. What is the Metric API? The Metric API is a way to get metric data into New Relic. The API works by sending a POST request to our HTTP endpoint with a JSON payload containing the metric data. The Metric API is how metrics are ingested from some of our integrations, including our open source exporters (like DropWizard, OpenCensus, and Prometheus). The Metric API is also used by our Telemetry SDKs, which are language-specific tools that make it easier to use our data-ingest APIs. The Metric API can be used to: Report metric data to New Relic without a New Relic agent. Integrate metric data from an open source or in-house developed tool, library, or framework. Fully control the metric data you're sending, including the resolution and associated dimensions. Leverage the power of NRQL, New Relic's query language, for querying your metric data. Set up alerts for your metric data. Requirements Ensure outbound connectivity on TCP port 443 is allowed to the CIDR range that matches your region. The preferred configuration method is to use the DNS name metric-api.newrelic.com or metric-api.eu.newrelic.com. You'll need a New Relic license key for the New Relic account you want to send data to. For information on limits and restricted attributes, see Metric API requirements and limits. Get started If we don't have an existing integration that meets your metric-reporting needs, you have two options: Use our Telemetry SDKs, which are language-specific tools that help you send us metrics and other data. Use the Metric API directly. Find and use your data You can find data sent via the Metric API (including from integrations that use this API) in these locations: From one.newrelic.com, select Explorer and look for your service. By querying the Metric data type. For example, you can use NRQL to run: SELECT * FROM Metric Copy For more on querying, see Metric query examples. For information on querying in general, see Query data. Alert on metric data To alert on metrics created with the Metric API, use NRQL alert conditions: Select the NRQL category when defining your condition, then use the FROM Metric ... NRQL query syntax to express it. When you create these alert conditions, Alerts automatically uses the finest granularity data available (the raw metric data points) to evaluate alerts. Data retention All raw metric data points will be retained for 30 days. All additional aggregated data derived from the raw metric data points (for example, one-minute rollups) will be retained for 13 months. Any change to the retention period beyond such periods may result in a charge to you. Troubleshooting See Troubleshoot an NrIntegrationError event.",

This document includes a quick start to send your first custom metric, plus detailed information on how to format and send your metric data. Quick start: Send metric data We report the metric types count, gauge, and summary. For more information on metrics see our documentation. Metric data is submitted to New Relic through an HTTP POST request. Each request is composed of one or more metric data points, which consist of a metric name, a timestamp, and a value. Follow this example to send your first metric data points to New Relic: Get the license key for the account you want to report data to. Insert the license key into the following JSON, and then send the JSON to our endpoint. This example creates a single metric data point for a metric named memory.heap, but you can create additional attributes or data points by specifying metric types or adding optional common blocks. curl -vvv -k -H \"Content-Type: application/json\" \\ -H \"Api-Key: NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY\" \\ -X POST https://metric-api.newrelic.com/metric/v1 \\ --data '[{ \"metrics\":[{ \"name\":\"memory.heap\", \"type\":\"gauge\", \"value\":2.3, \"timestamp\":CURRENT_TIME, \"attributes\":{\"host.name\":\"dev.server.com\"} }] }]' Copy The metric should be available in New Relic in a few seconds. You can query the data from any NRQL interface using this query: FROM Metric SELECT max(memory.heap) TIMESERIES Copy For more on where data shows up, see Find Metric API data. Endpoint URL Use an HTTP POST when sending metric data to the metric API endpoint: https://metric-api.newrelic.com/metric/v1 Copy Tip If your account hosts data in the EU data center, ensure you're using the proper API endpoints for EU region accounts. HTTP request headers Include the following HTTP request headers with the POST request. You can send some parameters as query parameters instead of request headers. Header Send as a query parameter? Details Content-Type No Required. Must be application/json. Content-Length No Required (usually set automatically by the HTTP client). The length of the request body in octets (8-bit bytes) unless sent with chunked encoding. This header is generally set by default by the underlying HTTP client sending the data and in most cases should not require any additional effort by the end user. Api-Key Yes Required. A license key for the account you want to report data to. If this is provided as both a header and a query parameter, the values must match. Content-Encoding No Required if GZIP. The value must be GZIP or Identity. If no value is present, then Identity is assumed. x-request-id No Optional - Reserved for future use. The value must be a valid UUID4. The value is expected to be unique for each request. HTTP request body The body of the HTTP POST request must be in JSON format. The following describes the requirements and recommendations for the JSON payload. The payload must be encoded as UTF-8. Structure The JSON payload uses this structure: The JSON payload is an array of maps. Each map must contain a metrics key whose value is an array containing one or more metric data points. A metric data point is identified by a name, value, and timestamp along with an optional set of attributes. JSON payload creating two metrics This example payload creates two metrics. service.errors.all is a count metric with three attributes and service.memory is a gauge metric with two attributes. [ { \"metrics\": [ { \"name\": \"service.errors.all\", \"type\": \"count\", \"value\": 15, \"timestamp\": [CURRENT_TIME](#optional-map-attributes), \"interval.ms\": 10000, \"attributes\": { \"service.response.statuscode\": \"400\", \"host.name\": \"dev.server.com\", \"service.name\": \"foo\" } }, { \"name\": \"service.memory\", \"type\": \"gauge\", \"value\": 2.7, \"timestamp\": CURRENT_TIME, \"attributes\": { \"host.name\": \"dev.server.com\", \"app.name\": \"foo\" } } ] } ] Copy Required key-value pairs Each metric data point map in the metrics array uses the following key-value structure: Key Description name string Required. The name of the metric. The value must be less than 255 characters. value number or map Required. The value varies depending on the metric type. For gauge and count the value should be a single number. For summary, the value should be a map with key-value pairs specifying the count, sum, min, and max. timestamp long Required. The metric's start time in Unix time. Defaults to the current time in UTC timezone. This field also support seconds, microseconds, and nanoseconds. However, the data will be converted to milliseconds for storage and query. Metrics reported with a timestamp older than 48 hours ago or newer than 24 hours from the time they are reported are dropped. interval.ms positive long Required for count and summary metric types. The length of the time window. type Recommended. This should be one of the supported metric types. If you do not specify a type, then this will default to a gauge. attributes strings, JSON numbers, or booleans Recommended. A map of key value pairs associated with this specific metric. Values can be strings, JSON numbers, or booleans. Keys are case-sensitive and must be less than 255 characters. JSON payload with three metric types Here's an example payload containing one metric data point for each metric type: [ { \"metrics\": [ { \"name\": \"cache.misses\", \"type\": \"count\", \"value\": 15, \"timestamp\": [CURRENT_TIME](#optional-map-attributes), \"interval.ms\": 10000, \"attributes\": { \"cache.name\": \"myCache\", \"host.name\": \"dev.server.com\" } }, { \"name\": \"temperature\", \"type\": \"gauge\", \"value\": 15, \"timestamp\": CURRENT_TIME, \"attributes\": { \"city\": \"Portland\", \"state\": \"Oregon\" } }, { \"name\": \"service.response.duration\", \"type\": \"summary\", \"value\": { \"count\": 5, \"sum\": 0.004382655, \"min\": 0.0005093, \"max\": 0.001708826 }, \"interval.ms\": 10000, \"timestamp\": CURRENT_TIME, \"attributes\": { \"host.name\": \"dev.server.com\", \"app.name\": \"foo\" } } ] } ] Copy Share attributes across metrics with common If you want to include a set of attributes on multiple metrics (and not add the same attributes for each metric), you can use the common block. This is an optional map that specifies information that applies to all associated metric data points. Values in the common section will be overridden if the same key exists on a metric data point. The block can include: Attribute Description timestamp long The metric's start time in Unix time. This defaults to the current time in the UTC timezone. This field also supports seconds, microseconds, and nanoseconds. However, the data will be converted to milliseconds for storage and later querying. interval.ms positive long Required for count and summary.The length of the time window. attributes strings, JSON numbers, or booleans A map of key-value pairs associated with this specific metric. Values can be strings, JSON numbers, or booleans. Example of common attributes In the following example payload, three metrics are sent. All three metrics share app.name and host.name attributes, specified in the common block. Each metric also has a unique value for another attribute, server.response.statuscode. [ { \"common\" : { \"timestamp\": 1531414060739, \"interval.ms\": 10000, \"attributes\": { \"app.name\": \"foo\", \"host.name\": \"dev.server.com\" } }, \"metrics\": [ { \"name\": \"service.errors.all\", \"type\": \"count\", \"value\": 9, \"attributes\": { \"service.response.statuscode\": \"400\" } }, { \"name\": \"service.errors.all\", \"type\": \"count\", \"value\": 4, \"attributes\": { \"service.response.statuscode\": \"500\" } }, { \"name\": \"service.response.duration\", \"type\": \"summary\", \"value\": { \"count\": 5, \"sum\": 0.004382655, \"min\": 0.0005093, \"max\": 0.001708826 }, \"attributes\": { \"service.response.statuscode\": \"200\" } } ] } ] Copy Response validation and status codes The Metric API returns a 202 response code for successful requests. When your data is accepted, an HTTP 202 response code is returned with a response structure like this: HTTP/1.1 202 Accepted Content-Type: application/json; charset=UTF-8 Content-Length: 52 Access-Control-Allow-Methods: GET, POST, PUT, HEAD, OPTIONS Access-Control-Allow-Credentials: true Access-Control-Allow-Origin: * Connection: keep-alive {\"requestId\":\"f0e7bfff-001a-b000-0000-01682bcf4565\"} Copy Missing data with 202 response A 202 code indicates the API did receive your data, and that the data passed basic validation checks. Normally, your data will be available for querying within a few seconds. However, New Relic runs additional validation asynchronously after receiving your data. If you receive a 202 response but can't find your metric, this indicates that New Relic found an error during this asynchronous validation. You can find these errors by querying NrIntegrationError events in the account associated with the Insert API key you used. The requestId for each request will be tagged on the NrIntegrationError event. For more information, see Troubleshoot an NRIntegrationError event. Status codes The Metric API can return the following HTTP status codes: Status code Definition 202 Data accepted. 400 Structure of the request is invalid. 403 Authentication failure. 404 The request path is incorrect. 405 Used a request method other than POST. 408 The request took too long to reach the endpoint. 411 The Content-Length header wasn’t included. 413 The payload was too big. Payloads must be under 1MB (10^6 bytes). 414 The request URI was too long. 415 The Content-Type or Content-Encoding was invalid. 429 The request rate quota has been exceeded. 431 The request headers are too long. 5xx There was a server error (please retry).",

      "body": "Problem You sent metric data points to the Metric API, and are not seeing what you expect when querying the data. Use the following checklist to determine the root cause: Make sure you are querying the data correctly. Check the HTTP status codes returned by the API. Issues like authorization failures can be diagnosed with HTTP status codes. If you are sending data from a Prometheus server via New Relic's remote_write endpoint, check your Prometheus server logs for errors or non-2xx HTTP responses from the New Relic endpoint. Query your account for NrIntegrationError events. New Relic's ingestion endpoints are asynchronous, meaning the endpoint verifies the payload after it returns the HTTP response. If any issues occur while verifying your payload, then an NrIntegrationError event will be created in your account. New Relic also uses NrIntegrationError events to notify customers when various rate limits have been reached. Solution View error details For an introduction to using the NrIntegrationError event, see NrIntegrationError. Here's an example NRQL for examining issues with Metric API ingest: SELECT count(*) FROM NrIntegrationError WHERE newRelicFeature = 'Metrics' facet category, message limit 100 since 24 hours ago Copy The category indicates the type of error and the message provides more detailed information about the error. If the category is rateLimit, then you should also examine the rateLimitType field for more information on the type of rate limiting. Category rateLimitType Description and solution BadRequest (not set) There is an issue with the JSON payload. These include JSON syntax errors, attribute names, or values that are too long. Check the message field to determine the exact issue. Then review the JSON payload, and update it to ensure it meets the proper semantic guidelines. RateLimit DatapointsPerMinute You are sending too many datapoints per minute. If you get this error, you can either send data less frequently, or request changes to your metric rate limits by contacting your New Relic account representative, or visiting our Support portal. RateLimit UniqueTimeseriesPerDay You have an attribute with a high number of unique values, like containerId or URI. To resolve this error, review any attributes that may be causing the issue and remove them. If desired, you can use a data dropping rule to remove attributes at ingest time. RateLimit UniquePrometheusTimeseries You have Prometheus servers reporting too many unique timeseries via New Relic's remote_write endpoint. Reduce the number of unique timeseries reported by modifying your Prometheus server configuration to reduce the number of targets being scraped, or by using relabel rules in the remote_write section of your server configuration to drop timeseries or highly unique labels. RateLimit RequestsPerMinute Too many requests per minute are being sent. To resolve this, put more datapoints in each request, and send them less frequently. RateLimit ErrorGroupsPerDay You have exceeded your daily error group limit. Incoming error groups will be dropped for the remainder of the day and will continue as normal after UTC midnight. To resolve this, reduce the amount of unique error messages collected by New Relic. Match errors to ingested payloads When an NrIntegrationError event is created as a result of a syntax issue with the HTTP request payload, then the event contains the attributes apiKeyPrefix and requestId. The apiKeyPrefix matches the first 6 characters of the API key used to send the data. The requestId matches the requestId sent in the HTTP response. To view these fields, run this NRQL query: SELECT message, apiKeyPrefix, requestId FROM NrIntegrationError limit 100 Copy To verify a specific requestId, run this NRQL query: SELECT * FROM NrIntegrationError where requestId ='REQUEST_ID' Copy Programmatically retrieve NrIntegrationError events To programmatically retrieve these errors: Ensure you have an Insights query API key (go to insights.newrelic.com > Manage data > API keys). Create an HTTP request as shown below: Tip If your account hosts data in the EU data center, ensure you're using the proper API endpoints for EU region accounts. curl -H \"Accept: application/json\" -H \"X-Query-Key:YOUR_API_KEY_HERE\" \"https://insights-api.newrelic.com/v1/accounts/YOUR_ACCOUNT_HERE/query?nrql=SELECT%20*%20FROM%20NrIntegrationError%20where%20newRelicFeature='Metrics'\" Copy",

      "body": "The New Relic Event API is one way to report custom events to New Relic. The Event API lets you send custom event data to your New Relic account with a POST command. These events are then queryable and chartable using NRQL. Want to try out our Event API? Create a New Relic account for free! No credit card required. Related content: Learn about all options for reporting custom events. For details about how event data is retained, see Event data retention. For how to add attributes to existing events, see Add custom attributes. Check out New Relic University’s tutorial Adding custom events with the Event API (aka the Insights API). Or, go directly to the full online course Custom data. Requirements For Event API limits and restricted attributes, see Limits. Ensure outbound connectivity on TCP port 443 is allowed to the CIDR range that matches your region. The preferred configuration method is to use the DNS name insights-collector.newrelic.com or insights-collector.eu01.nr-data.net. Basic workflow The Event API is an asynchronous endpoint. This allows you to send a very large volume of POSTS, reliably, with very low response latency. Tip If your account hosts data in the EU data center, ensure you are using the proper API endpoints for EU region accounts. To send a custom event to a New Relic account: Get a license key for the account you want to report data to. Before creating custom events or attributes, review New Relic's list of reserved terms used by NRQL. Generate JSON for the event by instrumenting your application, querying an API, or some other method. Submit a compressed JSON payload (for example, gzip or deflate) to the HTTPS endpoint using curl in a POST request. Recommendation: Set up NRQL alert conditions to notify you when parsing errors occur. This method will send the events directly into your account, where they will be accessible from any NRQL interface or with the Query API. The Event API limits the size, rate, and characters allowed in custom events. Also, like other events available in NRQL, custom events cannot be updated or deleted after they are created. If you have problems with your custom event, follow the troubleshooting procedures or create a new custom event. Get the license key You'll need a license key. License keys are associated with an account, not a specific user. This means that anyone in the account with access to that key can use it. You can submit multiple event types to the same account with the same license key. However, to help ensure security, we recommend that you use different keys for different applications or data sources. Alternatively, you can use an Insights insert keyfor this API, but we recommend using a license key. Format the JSON The Event API accepts specific formats for attributes included in the payload. Only float or string values are allowed. JSON format guidelines When defining attributes for your custom events, follow these JSON format guidelines. Attributes JSON format guidelines eventType Required: The event's name. Float and string values Float value format: \"label\":value String value format: \"label\":\"value\" Data types The API only accepts key-value pairs, not map/object or array values. Supported data types for this API are strings and numbers (integers or floats). For more information, see Data requirements. Digits in strings For performance-related reasons, we do not cast values submitted to the API. For example, we treat 123 as a number and \"123\" as a string. The database will only store up to 64 bit numbers. Any numbers larger than 64 bits will be truncated. Dates For attributes that contain date information, use an unformatted Unix timestamp in the Insights data formatter. You can define the date attribute either in seconds or in milliseconds, both relative to the Unix epoch. Time Unless otherwise specified, the timestamp for a submitted event is the time it was submitted to New Relic. To specify a different time for the event, use the timestamp attribute. JSON example Here is an example of a typical JSON data set for sending with the API. This call sends two Purchase type events as a JSON array. You can add multiple events in a single HTTP call using a JSON array. [ { \"eventType\":\"Purchase\", \"account\":3, \"amount\":259.54 }, { \"eventType\":\"Purchase\", \"account\":5, \"amount\":12309, \"product\":\"Item\" } ] Copy When generating the JSON, make sure your attributes are properly formatted. Limits and restricted characters The following size and rate limits apply to events sent via the Event API: Max events per API call: 2K Payload total size: 1MB(10^6 bytes) maximum per POST. We highly recommend using compression. The payload must be encoded as UTF-8. Number of attributes per event: 255 maximum Length of attribute name: 255 characters Length of attribute value: 4096 maximum character length There are rate limits on the number of HTTP requests per minute sent to the Event API. Some specific attributes have additional restrictions: accountId: This is a reserved attribute name. If it is included, it will be dropped during ingest. entity.guid, entity.name, and entity.type: These attributes are used internally to identify entities. Any values submitted with these keys in the attributes section of a metric data point may cause undefined behavior such as missing entities in the UI or telemetry not associating with the expected entities. For more information please refer to Entity synthesis. appId: Value must be an integer. If it is not an integer, the attribute name and value will be dropped during ingest. eventType: Can be a combination of alphanumeric characters, _ underscores, and : colons. timestamp: Must be a Unix epoch timestamp. You can define timestamps either in seconds or in milliseconds. Submit the custom event Data submitted to the Event API uses a compressed JSON format in a simple HTTPS POST request. This example uses gzip, but you can also use deflate. Linux/bash example gzip -c example_events.json | curl -X POST -H \"Content-Type: application/json\" -H \"Api-Key: YOUR_LICENSE_KEY\" -H \"Content-Encoding: gzip\" https://insights-collector.newrelic.com/v1/accounts/YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID/events --data-binary @- Copy Windows/PowerShell example $accountId = \"YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID\" $insertkey = \"YOUR_LICENSE_KEY\" # Replace with your custom event for the body $body = '[{\"eventType\": \"powershell\", \"account\": 4, \"amount\": 123, \"fileLocation\": \"c:\\\\temp2\", \"zipped\": \"true\" }]' $headers = @{} $headers.Add(\"Api-Key\", \"$insertkey\") $headers.Add(\"Content-Encoding\", \"gzip\") $encoding = [System.Text.Encoding]::UTF8 $enc_data = $encoding.GetBytes($body) $output = [System.IO.MemoryStream]::new() $gzipStream = New-Object System.IO.Compression.GzipStream $output, ([IO.Compression.CompressionMode]::Compress) $gzipStream.Write($enc_data, 0, $enc_data.Length) $gzipStream.Close() $gzipBody = $output.ToArray() Invoke-WebRequest -Headers $headers -Method Post -Body $gzipBody \"https://insights-collector.newrelic.com/v1/accounts/$accountId/events\" Copy Important Always use compression with every payload. This allows you to send more data, and it saves resources during parsing. Before generating your HTTP request, make sure it is properly formatted, including: The Api-Key contains the correct license key. The Content-Type is application/json. The request uses POST only. The API does not accept PUT and GET requests. The API supports HTTP/1.1 persistent connections. This is helpful to manage client-side performance under heavy event loads. Verify or troubleshoot request response The Event API follows a two-step process to process requests: The Event API synchronously acknowledges or rejects the request based on validation of the headers and payload size. The Event API asynchronously parses the payload after a successful HTTP response is provided to the client. This may generate an error due to missing or malformed data. These are classified as submission errors or parsing errors. All successful submissions receive a 200 response, regardless of any data errors that may exist within the payload. The response includes a uuid, which is a unique ID created for each request. The uuid also appears in any error events created for the request. Other potential issues: 10-second timeout: API calls exceeding 10 seconds will time out. Large payloads: Payloads exceeding 100 KB may see increased response times. Recommendation: In addition to checking for a success message, create a NRQL query of your data to verify it's available. Success response code Success message Comments 200 {\"success\":true,\"uuid\":\"xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx\"} Copy Submission errors Payloads with submission errors are handled and returned to the sender through an HTTP response code. To troubleshoot payload submission errors, refer to these HTTP response codes. Submission errors Troubleshooting 400 Missing or invalid content length: Unable to process empty request. 403 Missing or invalid key: Invalid license key. Register a valid license key. 408 Request timed out: Request took too long to process. 413 Content too large: Request is too large to process. Refer to the limits and restricted characters to troubleshoot. 415 Invalid content type: Must be application/JSON. The Event API accepts any content type except multi-part/related and assumes it can be parsed to JSON. 429 Too many requests due to rate limiting. 503 Service temporarily unavailable: Retry request Parsing errors Parsing errors occur if: An event is sent within a payload, but it is either missing data or is exceeding maximum limits. New Relic will drop the individual event from the payload, generate an NrIntegrationError event, and process the rest. The JSON payload includes malformed JSON or missing required data. Payloads with parsing errors receive a 200 response to indicate a successful submission. To help resolve parsing errors, a new NrIntegrationError event type is created. All parsing errors are due to NRQL queries. For error messages related to dropped events, New Relic will include the number of events that were dropped as part of the message. To troubleshoot requests with parsing errors, refer to these error messages. Parsing errors Troubleshooting X event(s) rejected because attribute appId was not an integer An appId attribute has a non-integer value, such as a decimal value or string. X event(s) rejected because eventType cannot contain the following characters: [., \\] An eventType attributed included an invalid character, such as a period or backslash. X event(s) rejected because attribute is missing attribute name An attribute name was set to null or an empty string. X event(s) rejected because attribute name exceeded maximum length An attribute name has more than 255 characters. X event(s) rejected because attribute value exceeded maximum length An attribute value was longer than 4096 characters. X event(s) rejected because event exceeded maximum number of attributes An event has more than 255 attributes. X event(s) rejected because missing required attributes eventType The eventType attribute is required for the custom event. Error parsing JSON payload There was an error parsing the request JSON because of formatting problems or corrupted data. Query and alert with NrIntegrationError The NrIntegrationError event allows you to query and set alerts on custom data being sent to your New Relic account. Recommendation: To get alerts for parsing errors, create a NRQL alert condition for NrIntegrationError. Use this example NRQL query: SELECT message FROM NrIntegrationError WHERE newRelicFeature = 'Event API' AND category = 'EventApiException' Copy NrIntegrationError attributes Troubleshooting timestamp The timestamp when the request was received. The timestamp attribute takes a 64-bit integer Unix timestamp within the last 24 hours. You can define timestamps either in seconds or in milliseconds, both relative to the Unix epoch. Do not use a decimal for the timestamp. If a decimal is used, the attribute will default to the timestamp when the custom event was created. newRelicFeature The name of the feature experiencing errors. For all custom event parsing errors, this will be Event API. apiKeyPrefix The first six characters of the license key used for the request that generated an error. requestId The uuid returned by the the API for the request that generated an error. Category The category of the error. For custom events, this is EventApiException. Message Contents of the error message. Name The error's name. For custom events, this is always EventValidationException. eventTypeSample One of the event types that generated the error, when available. Find your data To find data sent via the Event API (and from integrations that use this API), you can query it. For example, to query a custom event using NRQL, you would run: SELECT * FROM YOUR_CUSTOM_EVENT Copy For more on how to query, see Query data. Limit on HTTP requests The Event API has a rate limit of 100,000 HTTP requests (POSTs) per minute, per account. (Note that this is not a limit on the number of events per minute; only on the number of POSTs per minute.) This limit helps ensure that large traffic spikes in accounts across our multi-tenant platform do not negatively affect how the service performs for you. If your API usage exceeds 100k POSTs in a 1-minute window, we will reject subsequent API requests with a 429 response code for the remainder of the 1-minute window. At the end of the 1-minute window, the counter will be reset and allow traffic to resume. This limit is intended to be an upper threshold that you shouldn't hit under normal scenarios. If you have a high number of 429 responses, consider using the API less. If you are expecting a higher-than-normal activity level in the near future and want to prepare for that, contact technical support.",

      "body": "To ensure our systems are always up and ready to support you, and to keep you from unintended use, we place limits on the amount of data you can send, query, and store. Responses to limit violations Limits are enforced per child account, and across our APIs. You might reach a limit if you start monitoring a new high-traffic application, or have a sudden data spike. When you do reach a limit, New Relic responds according to the type of data and the limit that’s reached. For example: We place a limit on the number of ingested requests per minute (RPM) per data type. When this limit is reached, we stop accepting data and return a 429 status code for the duration of the minute. For queries, we place limits on the number of queries per minute and the number of records inspected (see query limits). When the number of queries per minute limit is reached, New Relic will begin rejecting queries until the number of queries is below the limit. When the records inspected limit is reached, New Relic will reject traffic from the source scanning the largest number of records and attempt to allow traffic from other sources. For metrics, we place a limit on the number of unique timeseries (cardinality) per account and per metric. When this limit is reached, aggregated data is turned off for the rest of the UTC day. For every major limit violation, New Relic creates an NrIntegrationError event for that account, which has these limit-related attributes: Attribute Description category RateLimit or ApiLimit. The RateLimit category is used for limits based on a unit of time such as the number of requests ingested per minute. The ApiLimit is used for constant limits, such as the number of attributes on a record. limitName The name of the limit. message Describes the limit and the impact. limitValue The limit reached. System limits UI The system Limits page (from the account dropdown, click Manage your data and click Limits on the left) displays when your account has encountered a rate limit in the specified time period. The page displays a default period of 24 hours; you can set a custom range from the top-right of the page. Non-limit-related NrIntegrationError events are not displayed here. In addition, this page does not display information about limits you have not hit, or how close you are to reaching a limit. For more on creating queries and alerts for data ingest and billing metrics, see Query billing/usage data. one.newrelic.com > account dropdown > Manage your data > Limits: An example of a chart on the Limits UI page displaying a cardinality violation limit issue. To add more detail, or build a dashboard, click the View NRQL button on the chart to see the NRQL powering this view. The graph displays each unique limit type that was reached during the selected time-period. This can help you find any trends based on time. The Limits page also provides a table where you can find the limit name, the limit event message associated with it, and last occurrence time and date. If you click a limit in the table, you see more about what happened, and when. one.newrelic.com > account dropdown > Manage your data > Limits: An example of a limit events table on the Limits UI page.

This way, you'll know your baselines, and can more easily spot an anomaly like an ingest spike, as well as its source. To break down your ingested data, start from the chart on the Data ingestion page. Think of the data source bands as the Y axis, and the dates as the X axis. Click on the band you want to inspect at the spot in the X axis that corresponds with the date you want to investigate. This image shows the Metrics band for June 15 right before it's clicked. A modal opens with the account, data source, and facet selected. You can do a handful of things on this page: Change the account, data source, or facet you want to drill down into. Change the date and time to investigate. Review the results of the query in chart form. The chart displays the top 15 results for the facet query. Open the NRQL query in the Query builder where you'll find additional facets that you can use. Learn more about NRQL queries here. How we break your ingest data down Some of the content in the UI is variable, depending on your account. This information is intended to help you understand how we're working with your ingest data. The chart on the Data ingestion page shows data usage for a little longer time frame than that covered by your retention settings for each data ingest source. If you choose a date outside of your designated retention period for an ingest source, you'll get the message that there's no chart data available. Select a more recent date to fix this problem. If you inspect a data source for an account that has less than a terrabyte of data, we compute the ingest volume over a 24 hour period; otherwise, we compute it for a 1 hour period. The ingest value provided on the main Data ingestion chart will be slightly different from that reflected during inspection. This is because our facet computation is an estimate. Set alerts for data use Query and alert on usage data describes how to set alerts to get notified if you're nearing data ingest limits you don't want to cross. For example, you might set an alert on logs, which can stack up quickly in an active system. Adjust your data ingest Drop data for lower retention costs and data compliance On ingest, we apply data dropping rules so you won't be charged for data that's not useful. Learn how to set additional data dropping rules yourself. Use NerdGraph to drop entire data types or drop data attributes from data types so they’re not written to NRDB. This enables you to focus on the data you want, reduces retention costs, and avoids writing sensitive data to the database. For dropping log data, see Drop data with drop filter rules. Turn off agents and integrations If you don’t need data from specific agents or integrations that you have installed, you can uninstall/delete those tools. For instructions, see the specific documentation for an agent or integration.",

      "body": "At New Relic, we're super proud of NRDB, the New Relic database where we store your data. It gathers all your telemetry data in one place, gives you a connected view of all your data, and scales as your business grows. We invite you to send all your metrics, events, logs, and traces to NRDB, including those from third-party sources. We also recognize that some data might not be necessary for your business goals. You shouldn’t have to wade through data you don’t need to get to the data you do. And you definitely shouldn’t have to pay for it. That’s where our data management tools come in: they let you decide what data you send to New Relic and how long it should be stored. Data management hub: from the user profile drop down, select Manage your data. Coupled with user management tools, data management helps you get maximum value from your investment in New Relic, all while safeguarding your data. Important Not yet a New Relic customer? Sign up to create your free account in only a few seconds. Then ingest up to 100GB of data for free each month. Forever. Where to find the Data management hub To locate the data management UI: From one.newrelic.com select the account dropdown, and select Manage your data. If you're on the New Relic One user model, you can also find the Data management hub by selecting Administration > Manage data. Better cost, performance, and compliance Collecting and storing data in New Relic allows you to analyze, visualize, and alert on all your metrics, events, logs, and traces from across all of your sources. However, it’s important to manage that data for cost, performance, and in some cases, compliance reasons. The data management hub provides the tools you need to understand and control where your data is coming from, and adjust what’s stored and for how long. Important If you're on our original product-based pricing plan, you'll see your data ingest, retention, and limits in the Data management hub. The primary difference is that you're not billed on ingest, as with our New Relic One pricing plan. Not sure which plan you're on? See Overview of pricing and user model. Cost management The cost of data storage continually decreases, but storage is still an expense. The amount of data you process and store is closely related to the value you receive from New Relic, because it’s a key component of how you’re charged. Our ingest process helps you hone your data. For example, data might arrive at our processing front door compressed and of varying quality. Through ingest, that data is uncompressed, decorated with queryable attributes, and evaluated. Elements are dropped or trimmed, all before we write it to NRDB. That way, the data you store is only the data you want most. Performance management While NRDB is a phenomenally scalable database, it’s also a reality that queries across huge datasets might not return results in a timely enough fashion for your needs. You get better performance if you limit the data we store, or convert it into a format that keeps it easily queryable. Drop data to improve performance by reducing the amount of data that’s stored. Ingest and retention strategies Depending on your goals, whether to reduce costs, increase specific retention rates, or pare down your data to what’s most essential, we have a strategy for you. Learn about reducing the amount of data that comes into NRDB in Manage data coming into New Relic. Learn about customizing storage so you only store the data you want, for the period you want in Manage data stored in New Relic. Learn about dropping data in Drop data using NerdGraph.

If you choose a date outside of your designated retention period for an ingest source, you'll get the message that there's no chart data available. Select a more recent date to fix this problem. If you inspect a data source for an account that has less than a terrabyte of data, we compute the ingest volume over a 24 hour period; otherwise, we compute it for a 1 hour period. The ingest value provided on the main Data ingestion chart will be slightly different from that reflected during inspection. This is because our facet computation is an estimate. Set alerts for data use Query and alert on usage data describes how to set alerts to get notified if you're nearing data ingest limits you don't want to cross. For example, you might set an alert on logs, which can stack up quickly in an active system. Adjust your data ingest Drop data for lower retention costs and data compliance On ingest, we apply data dropping rules so you won't be charged for data that's not useful. Learn how to set additional data dropping rules yourself. Use NerdGraph to drop entire data types or drop data attributes from data types so they’re not written to NRDB. This enables you to focus on the data you want, reduces retention costs, and avoids writing sensitive data to the database. For dropping log data, see Drop data with drop filter rules. Turn off agents and integrations If you don’t need data from specific agents or integrations that you have installed, you can uninstall/delete those tools. For instructions, see the specific documentation for an agent or integration.",

It gathers all your telemetry data in one place, gives you a connected view of all your data, and scales as your business grows. We invite you to send all your metrics, events, logs, and traces to NRDB, including those from third-party sources. We also recognize that some data might not be necessary for your business goals. You shouldn’t have to wade through data you don’t need to get to the data you do. And you definitely shouldn’t have to pay for it. That’s where our data management tools come in: they let you decide what data you send to New Relic and how long it should be stored. Data management hub: from the user profile drop down, select Manage your data. Coupled with user management tools, data management helps you get maximum value from your investment in New Relic, all while safeguarding your data. Important Not yet a New Relic customer? Sign up to create your free account in only a few seconds. Then ingest up to 100GB of data for free each month. Forever. Where to find the Data management hub To locate the data management UI: From one.newrelic.com select the account dropdown, and select Manage your data. If you're on the New Relic One user model, you can also find the Data management hub by selecting Administration > Manage data. Better cost, performance, and compliance Collecting and storing data in New Relic allows you to analyze, visualize, and alert on all your metrics, events, logs, and traces from across all of your sources. However, it’s important to manage that data for cost, performance, and in some cases, compliance reasons. The data management hub provides the tools you need to understand and control where your data is coming from, and adjust what’s stored and for how long. Important If you're on our original product-based pricing plan, you'll see your data ingest, retention, and limits in the Data management hub. The primary difference is that you're not billed on ingest, as with our New Relic One pricing plan. Not sure which plan you're on? See Overview of pricing and user model. Cost management The cost of data storage continually decreases, but storage is still an expense. The amount of data you process and store is closely related to the value you receive from New Relic, because it’s a key component of how you’re charged. Our ingest process helps you hone your data. For example, data might arrive at our processing front door compressed and of varying quality. Through ingest, that data is uncompressed, decorated with queryable attributes, and evaluated. Elements are dropped or trimmed, all before we write it to NRDB. That way, the data you store is only the data you want most. Performance management While NRDB is a phenomenally scalable database, it’s also a reality that queries across huge datasets might not return results in a timely enough fashion for your needs. You get better performance if you limit the data we store, or convert it into a format that keeps it easily queryable. Drop data to improve performance by reducing the amount of data that’s stored. Ingest and retention strategies Depending on your goals, whether to reduce costs, increase specific retention rates, or pare down your data to what’s most essential, we have a strategy for you. Learn about reducing the amount of data that comes into NRDB in Manage data coming into New Relic. Learn about customizing storage so you only store the data you want, for the period you want in Manage data stored in New Relic. Learn about dropping data in Drop data using NerdGraph.

Want to try out our Metric API? Create a New Relic account for free! No credit card required. What is the Metric API? The Metric API is a way to get metric data into New Relic. The API works by sending a POST request to our HTTP endpoint with a JSON payload containing the metric data. The Metric API is how metrics are ingested from some of our integrations, including our open source exporters (like DropWizard, OpenCensus, and Prometheus). The Metric API is also used by our Telemetry SDKs, which are language-specific tools that make it easier to use our data-ingest APIs. The Metric API can be used to: Report metric data to New Relic without a New Relic agent. Integrate metric data from an open source or in-house developed tool, library, or framework. Fully control the metric data you're sending, including the resolution and associated dimensions. Leverage the power of NRQL, New Relic's query language, for querying your metric data. Set up alerts for your metric data. Requirements Ensure outbound connectivity on TCP port 443 is allowed to the CIDR range that matches your region. The preferred configuration method is to use the DNS name metric-api.newrelic.com or metric-api.eu.newrelic.com. You'll need a New Relic license key for the New Relic account you want to send data to. For information on limits and restricted attributes, see Metric API requirements and limits. Get started If we don't have an existing integration that meets your metric-reporting needs, you have two options: Use our Telemetry SDKs, which are language-specific tools that help you send us metrics and other data. Use the Metric API directly. Find and use your data You can find data sent via the Metric API (including from integrations that use this API) in these locations: From one.newrelic.com, select Explorer and look for your service. By querying the Metric data type. For example, you can use NRQL to run: SELECT * FROM Metric Copy For more on querying, see Metric query examples. For information on querying in general, see Query data. Alert on metric data To alert on metrics created with the Metric API, use NRQL alert conditions: Select the NRQL category when defining your condition, then use the FROM Metric ... NRQL query syntax to express it. When you create these alert conditions, Alerts automatically uses the finest granularity data available (the raw metric data points) to evaluate alerts. Data retention All raw metric data points will be retained for 30 days. All additional aggregated data derived from the raw metric data points (for example, one-minute rollups) will be retained for 13 months. Any change to the retention period beyond such periods may result in a charge to you. Troubleshooting See Troubleshoot an NrIntegrationError event.",

These metrics include duration information for the monitor, location of the monitor check, size of the request and response headers, the type of monitor, and a timestamp. Each time a synthetic monitor runs a check, details about the check are captured in theSyntheticCheck event type. SyntheticCheck events contain details specific to the check to provide visibility such as the status, type of monitor, and size of request and response headers. SyntheticRequest SyntheticRequest returns results from individual HTTP requests made during a check. The data gathered include job information, location, type of content for request, duration information, request size, and page load information. With each simple or scripted monitor check, we capture each individual HTTP request made during the check. The HTTP details are captured at a more granular level than the SyntheticCheck event type. SyntheticPrivateLocationStatus Every monitor check running on a private location triggers capacity details for that private location. These details are captured in a SyntheticPrivateLocationStatus event. This provides visibility into the capacity of a private location and whether additional minions are required to support the workload. SyntheticPrivateMinion If you have private locations, such as those inside your firewall, you can view information regarding those locations with the SyntheticPrivateMinion event.

      "body": "If you have APM, you can report custom event data. You can then query and visualize your data in New Relic. Data considerations New Relic agents send event data to New Relic as part of the normal harvest cycle every five seconds for agent versions supporting real time streaming. Sending a lot of events can increase the memory overhead of the agent. New Relic enforces an upper limit of 833 custom events every 5 seconds. Additionally, posts greater than 1MB (10^6 bytes) in size will not be recorded, regardless of the custom event limit. You can also send custom events using the Event API (without need for APM). However, be aware that custom events sent with the agent APIs are not compatible with high security mode. Tip For more information, check out New Relic University’s tutorial Adding custom data with the APM agent API. Or, go directly to the full online course Custom data with APM. Record custom events and attributes You can add your own custom APM events and attributes, which you can then use for querying and charting. This is one of several ways to report custom data. To record a custom event, follow the procedures for your New Relic language agent. To add custom attributes to APM events, you must first enable them for your APM agent, and then make an API call to record the attribute. Follow the agent-specific custom attribute procedures. When creating your own custom events and attributes, follow data requirements for: Size limits Attribute types Reserved words C SDK To add a custom event to apps monitored by the C SDK, start a transaction and use the newrelic_create_custom_event and newrelic_record_custom_event functions. For more information, see the Guide to using the C SDK API. You can then add custom attributes for your C SDK app. Go To add a custom event to apps monitored by the Go agent, use RecordCustomEvent. You can then add custom attributes for your Go app. Java Custom event collection is enabled by default in Java agent version 3.13.0 or higher. To send custom events, call recordCustomEvent. For example: Map<String, Object> eventAttributes = new HashMap<String, Object>(); NewRelic.getAgent().getInsights().recordCustomEvent(\"MyCustomEvent\", eventAttributes); Copy The first argument defines the name of your event type, and the second argument is a map with the attributes for your custom event. Event attributes must be strings or numbers. Ensure you limit the number of unique event type names that you create, and do not generate these names dynamically. For restrictions on event type names, see our documentation about limits and restricted characters and NRQL reserved words. You can change the maximum number of events recorded by the Java agent via a configuration parameter in newrelic.yml. Specify the maximum number of events to record per minute as an integer. For example, if you want to send less than the default of 10000 events: custom_insights_events: max_samples_stored: 5000 Copy To disable custom events entirely, add the following to your newrelic.yml: custom_insights_events: enabled: false Copy You can then add custom attributes for your Java app. For Java agent versions prior to 4.1.0, use the following YAML configuration: custom_insights_events.enabled: true custom_insights_events.max_samples_stored: 5000 Copy .NET Custom event collection is enabled by default in .NET agent version 4.6.29.0 or higher. To send custom events, simply call RecordCustomEvent(). For example: var eventAttributes = new Dictionary<String, Object>(); NewRelic.Api.Agent.NewRelic.RecordCustomEvent('MyCustomEvent', eventAttributes); Copy The first argument defines the name of your event type, and the second argument is an IEnumerable with the attributes for your custom event. Ensure you limit the number of unique event type names that you create, and do not generate these names dynamically. For restrictions on event type names, see our documentation about limits and restricted characters and NRQL reserved words. You can then add custom attributes for your .NET app. You can turn off custom events entirely by setting customEvents.enabled to false in newrelic.config. Node.js Custom event collection is enabled by default in Node.js agent version 1.15.0 or higher. To send custom events, simply call the relevant API. For example: recordCustomEvent(eventType, attributes) Copy Use recordCustomEvent to record an event-based metric, usually associated with a particular duration. The eventType must be an alphanumeric string less than 255 characters. The attributes must be an object of key and value pairs. The keys must be shorter than 255 characters, and the values must be string, number, or boolean. For restrictions on event type names, see our documentation about limits and restricted characters and NRQL reserved words. You can then add custom attributes for your Node.js app. To disable custom events entirely, add custom_insights_events.enabled: false to newrelic.js. PHP Custom event collection is enabled by default in PHP agent version 4.18 or higher. To send custom events, simply call the relevant API function. For example: newrelic_record_custom_event(\"WidgetSale\", array(\"color\"=>\"red\", \"weight\"=>12.5)); Copy The first argument defines the name of your event type, and the second argument is an array with the attributes for your custom event. Ensure you limit the number of unique event type names that you create, and do not generate these names dynamically. For restrictions on event type names, see our documentation about limits and restricted characters and NRQL reserved words. By default, the maximum number of custom events recorded per minute is 10,000. This setting cannot be changed. You can then add custom attributes for your PHP app. To disable custom events entirely, add newrelic.custom_insights_events.enabled = false to your newrelic.ini and restart the agent. Python Custom event collection is enabled by default in Python agent version 2.60.0.46 or higher. To send custom events, simply call the relevant API. For example: newrelic.agent. record_custom_event (event_type, params, application=None) Copy The event_type defines the name (or type) of the custom event. Attributes of the custom event should be passed in as a dictionary via the params keyword argument. Ensure you limit the number of unique event type names that you create, and do not generate these names dynamically. For limits and restrictions on event_type and params, see our documentation about limits and restricted characters and reserved words If called outside of the context of a monitored web request or background task, the call will be ignored unless the application keyword argument is provided and an application object corresponding to the application against which the exception should be recorded is provided. A suitable application object can be obtained using the newrelic.agent.application() function. You can then add custom attributes for your Python app. To disable custom events entirely, set custom_insights_events.enabled to False in your newrelic.ini configuration file. Ruby Custom event collection is enabled by default in Ruby agent version 3.9.8.273 or higher. To send custom events, simply call the relevant API. For example: ::NewRelic::Agent.record_custom_event('WidgetSale', color: 'red', weight: 12.5) Copy The first argument defines the name of your event type, and the second argument is a hash with the attributes for your custom event. Ensure you limit the number of unique event type names that you create, and do not generate these names dynamically. For restrictions on event type names, see our documentation about limits and restricted characters and NRQL reserved words. You can change the maximum number of events recorded by the Ruby agent via a configuration parameter in newrelic.yml: Add custom_insights_events.max_samples_stored: to your configuration file. Specify the maximum number of events to record per minute as an integer.

Timestamps You may not specify a timestamp on events that are collected and recorded via the agent. The agent will automatically assign a timestamp to events based on when they are recorded via the API.

Select an event name in the following table to see its attributes. Event Description SyntheticCheck SyntheticCheck returns metrics from one run of a specific monitor. These metrics include duration information for the monitor, location of the monitor check, size of the request and response headers, the type of monitor, and a timestamp. Each time a synthetic monitor runs a check, details about the check are captured in theSyntheticCheck event type. SyntheticCheck events contain details specific to the check to provide visibility such as the status, type of monitor, and size of request and response headers. SyntheticRequest SyntheticRequest returns results from individual HTTP requests made during a check. The data gathered include job information, location, type of content for request, duration information, request size, and page load information. With each simple or scripted monitor check, we capture each individual HTTP request made during the check. The HTTP details are captured at a more granular level than the SyntheticCheck event type. SyntheticPrivateLocationStatus Every monitor check running on a private location triggers capacity details for that private location. These details are captured in a SyntheticPrivateLocationStatus event. This provides visibility into the capacity of a private location and whether additional minions are required to support the workload. SyntheticPrivateMinion If you have private locations, such as those inside your firewall, you can view information regarding those locations with the SyntheticPrivateMinion event. Each private minion running sends health details to SyntheticPrivateMinion every 30 seconds. This allows you to understand the health of the private minion running at the location.

      "body": "If you have APM, you can report custom event data. You can then query and visualize your data in New Relic. Data considerations New Relic agents send event data to New Relic as part of the normal harvest cycle every five seconds for agent versions supporting real time streaming. Sending a lot of events can increase the memory overhead of the agent. New Relic enforces an upper limit of 833 custom events every 5 seconds. Additionally, posts greater than 1MB (10^6 bytes) in size will not be recorded, regardless of the custom event limit. You can also send custom events using the Event API (without need for APM). However, be aware that custom events sent with the agent APIs are not compatible with high security mode. Tip For more information, check out New Relic University’s tutorial Adding custom data with the APM agent API. Or, go directly to the full online course Custom data with APM. Record custom events and attributes You can add your own custom APM events and attributes, which you can then use for querying and charting. This is one of several ways to report custom data. To record a custom event, follow the procedures for your New Relic language agent. To add custom attributes to APM events, you must first enable them for your APM agent, and then make an API call to record the attribute. Follow the agent-specific custom attribute procedures. When creating your own custom events and attributes, follow data requirements for: Size limits Attribute types Reserved words C SDK To add a custom event to apps monitored by the C SDK, start a transaction and use the newrelic_create_custom_event and newrelic_record_custom_event functions. For more information, see the Guide to using the C SDK API. You can then add custom attributes for your C SDK app. Go To add a custom event to apps monitored by the Go agent, use RecordCustomEvent. You can then add custom attributes for your Go app. Java Custom event collection is enabled by default in Java agent version 3.13.0 or higher. To send custom events, call recordCustomEvent. For example: Map<String, Object> eventAttributes = new HashMap<String, Object>(); NewRelic.getAgent().getInsights().recordCustomEvent(\"MyCustomEvent\", eventAttributes); Copy The first argument defines the name of your event type, and the second argument is a map with the attributes for your custom event. Event attributes must be strings or numbers. Ensure you limit the number of unique event type names that you create, and do not generate these names dynamically. For restrictions on event type names, see our documentation about limits and restricted characters and NRQL reserved words. You can change the maximum number of events recorded by the Java agent via a configuration parameter in newrelic.yml. Specify the maximum number of events to record per minute as an integer. For example, if you want to send less than the default of 10000 events: custom_insights_events: max_samples_stored: 5000 Copy To disable custom events entirely, add the following to your newrelic.yml: custom_insights_events: enabled: false Copy You can then add custom attributes for your Java app. For Java agent versions prior to 4.1.0, use the following YAML configuration: custom_insights_events.enabled: true custom_insights_events.max_samples_stored: 5000 Copy .NET Custom event collection is enabled by default in .NET agent version 4.6.29.0 or higher. To send custom events, simply call RecordCustomEvent(). For example: var eventAttributes = new Dictionary<String, Object>(); NewRelic.Api.Agent.NewRelic.RecordCustomEvent('MyCustomEvent', eventAttributes); Copy The first argument defines the name of your event type, and the second argument is an IEnumerable with the attributes for your custom event. Ensure you limit the number of unique event type names that you create, and do not generate these names dynamically. For restrictions on event type names, see our documentation about limits and restricted characters and NRQL reserved words. You can then add custom attributes for your .NET app. You can turn off custom events entirely by setting customEvents.enabled to false in newrelic.config. Node.js Custom event collection is enabled by default in Node.js agent version 1.15.0 or higher. To send custom events, simply call the relevant API. For example: recordCustomEvent(eventType, attributes) Copy Use recordCustomEvent to record an event-based metric, usually associated with a particular duration. The eventType must be an alphanumeric string less than 255 characters. The attributes must be an object of key and value pairs. The keys must be shorter than 255 characters, and the values must be string, number, or boolean. For restrictions on event type names, see our documentation about limits and restricted characters and NRQL reserved words. You can then add custom attributes for your Node.js app. To disable custom events entirely, add custom_insights_events.enabled: false to newrelic.js. PHP Custom event collection is enabled by default in PHP agent version 4.18 or higher. To send custom events, simply call the relevant API function. For example: newrelic_record_custom_event(\"WidgetSale\", array(\"color\"=>\"red\", \"weight\"=>12.5)); Copy The first argument defines the name of your event type, and the second argument is an array with the attributes for your custom event. Ensure you limit the number of unique event type names that you create, and do not generate these names dynamically. For restrictions on event type names, see our documentation about limits and restricted characters and NRQL reserved words. By default, the maximum number of custom events recorded per minute is 10,000. This setting cannot be changed. You can then add custom attributes for your PHP app. To disable custom events entirely, add newrelic.custom_insights_events.enabled = false to your newrelic.ini and restart the agent. Python Custom event collection is enabled by default in Python agent version 2.60.0.46 or higher. To send custom events, simply call the relevant API. For example: newrelic.agent. record_custom_event (event_type, params, application=None) Copy The event_type defines the name (or type) of the custom event. Attributes of the custom event should be passed in as a dictionary via the params keyword argument. Ensure you limit the number of unique event type names that you create, and do not generate these names dynamically. For limits and restrictions on event_type and params, see our documentation about limits and restricted characters and reserved words If called outside of the context of a monitored web request or background task, the call will be ignored unless the application keyword argument is provided and an application object corresponding to the application against which the exception should be recorded is provided. A suitable application object can be obtained using the newrelic.agent.application() function. You can then add custom attributes for your Python app. To disable custom events entirely, set custom_insights_events.enabled to False in your newrelic.ini configuration file. Ruby Custom event collection is enabled by default in Ruby agent version 3.9.8.273 or higher. To send custom events, simply call the relevant API. For example: ::NewRelic::Agent.record_custom_event('WidgetSale', color: 'red', weight: 12.5) Copy The first argument defines the name of your event type, and the second argument is a hash with the attributes for your custom event. Ensure you limit the number of unique event type names that you create, and do not generate these names dynamically. For restrictions on event type names, see our documentation about limits and restricted characters and NRQL reserved words. You can change the maximum number of events recorded by the Ruby agent via a configuration parameter in newrelic.yml: Add custom_insights_events.max_samples_stored: to your configuration file. Specify the maximum number of events to record per minute as an integer. For example, if you want to be able to send up to 5000 events per minute, add: custom_insights_events.max_samples_stored: 5000 Copy You can then add custom attributes for your Ruby app. To disable custom events entirely, add custom_insights_events.enabled: false to newrelic.yml. Timestamps You may not specify a timestamp on events that are collected and recorded via the agent. The agent will automatically assign a timestamp to events based on when they are recorded via the API. Limits and restricted characters See Custom event data requirements for size limits, data types, and naming syntax requirements. Reserved words Before creating custom attributes, review New Relic's list of reserved terms used by NRQL. Otherwise unexpected results may occur.",
