      "body": "The APM Summary page provides general information about the selected app, including web transactions and non-web transactions, Apdex score, CPU usage, throughput (requests per minute or rpm), transaction times, error rate, application activity, and hosts. Tip To get a high-level overview of all your applications and services, use the New Relic explorer. View your app's summary page To reach the Summary page, go to one.newrelic.com > Explorer > Services - APM > (select an app). Use the Explorer to access all your entities, that is, anything we can identify that reports data, from applications and hosts to custom groupings of any elements. Alternatively, you can go to one.newrelic.com > APM > (select an app). For more information, see the documentation about navigating core UI components in New Relic One. View app performance Use the Summary page for a quick summary of your website's performance. Overview charts Some charts include links to APM pages where you can drill down into additional details. APM Summary chart Comments Transactions response time This stacked chart represents the response time of web transactions or non-web transactions in your app. Segments in the chart vary depending on which agent you are using. Some charts may have an independent line for response time that represents the relationship between response time and total time. Also, for your external or background services, you may see data labeled as Web external. For more information about these out-of-process services, use the Externals page. Apdex score This chart measures the performance of your app based on its Apdex T value during the selected time window. To view additional details, hover over the question icon or the chart's End user and App server lines. The End user line charts the Apdex for your browser apps, and the App server line charts the Apdex for your APM apps. Throughput This chart illustrates the requests per minute for either web transactions or non-web transactions. To change the type of transaction, select the Transaction response time chart's dropdown arrow, then select Web or Non-web. Error rate This chart shows the number of errors that have occurred in the current time window. The tooltip that appears when you hover over the Error rate chart shows the combined throughput for both web and non-web transactions. To understand how error rate is calculated, see Application error rate example. Event markers Markers on the main Summary chart indicate events and changes to the app: Black vertical bar: Apdex settings have changed. Blue vertical bar: A deployment marker has been created or another event has occurred, such as a settings change for the app. Yellow or red area: This indicates alert thresholds have been violated. To view additional information, mouse over the marker. Drill-down details Use any of New Relic's standard page functions to drill down into detailed information. Here is a summary of additional options with the APM Summary page. If you want to... Do this... Change how data appears on the main chart Select the chart title's drop-down arrow, and then select your choice of view options, including histograms or percentiles if available. View threshold levels for your app's Apdex score Mouse over the Apdex score ? icon. For non-web transactions, the Apdex chart is blank because Apdex is not applicable to this class of apps. View trends in transaction time, Apdex, and throughput Select the Compare with yesterday and last week checkbox. The checkbox is only available when viewing the Web transaction response time chart with the time picker window Ending now. The checkbox is unavailable if you are viewing histograms, percentiles, or custom dates. View app performance since the last deployment From the time picker, select Performance since the last deployment. For detailed information about all deployments, select the Deployments page. View the Transactions page Select the Transactions table's heading on the APM Summary page. Or, to view details about a specific transaction (including operations, transaction traces, and key transactions), select its name. View the Databases or External services pages Click on a related time band in the Web transactions response time chart. View the Errors page Select the Error rate chart's title on the APM Summary page. You can also view the Errors page from one.newrelic.com > (select an app) > Events > Errors. Browser monitoring data If you install the browser agent via an APM agent, you can automatically link the browser-monitored app to the APM-monitored app. Once the browser agent is set up, the APM Summary page provides summary information and direct links to detailed information on the app's corresponding browser summary page. To view chart details with browser page load time, select the main chart's Browser link. To view the Apdex score for browsers, select the Apdex chart's Browser link. Link app performance to resources The APM Summary page shows a table with averages about your app's instances on their hosts, including: Apdex Response time Throughput Error rate CPU usage Memory Tip CPU usage percentage is calculated as though the application is running on one CPU core. For more information about this calculation, see CPU usage is over 100%. Examine app performance within system context Use any of these options to examine your app's performance within the context of your system's architecture and resources, such as individual hosts: Select your choice from the table at the bottom of the APM Summary page for infrastructure. Toggle between a table view or breakout metric details. If applicable, select your choice from the drop-down at the top of the APM Summary page for servers or JVMs. Examine details within infrastructure To help you understand the full context of your app's performance within your environment, APM includes options to view performance from inside the application, as well as from outside the application with the infrastructure agent. To view detailed information from your resources' point of view, click any host link. The link takes you directly to the infrastructure Compute page. When you click, the Compute data may not immediately appear. If that happens, follow the prompt to validate your account and complete the conversion process for the infrastructure agent. If you need additional help, get support at support.newrelic.com. Troubleshoot host link To troubleshoot the host link from the APM Summary page, use these tips: Host link from APM Summary Troubleshooting tips Your infrastructure agent is not installed on the host. Follow standard procedures to install our infrastructure agent. The application is operating within a container, and your infrastructure agent is installed on the container’s host. Set the hostname for the container to be the hostname of the underlying server. Docker containers: Run your Docker container with the argument: --uts=\"host\" Copy This will cause the container to share the UTS Linux Namespace with the underlying host. However, by using this set, a privileged container could change the host's hostname. The application is running on a Windows container, and your infrastructure agent is installed on the Windows host. To get a direct link to infrastructure metric data for your application, enable process metrics in the infrastructure agent's configuration. Your infrastructure agent is installed, but it only reports the short hostname, not the long hostname. Configure your server's hostname settings so that the infrastructure agent and the APM agent return the exact same name string. If possible, do so by editing your server's fully qualified domain name (FQDN) settings. The APM and infrastructure agents both read their hostname from the operating system's FQDN settings, so setting the hostname there ensures both agents share a single hostname. For more information, see the Java agent troubleshooting example.",

Or, to view details about a specific transaction (including operations, transaction traces, and key transactions), select its name. View the Databases or External services pages Click on a related time band in the Web transactions response time chart. View the Errors page Select the Error rate chart's title on the APM Summary page. You can also view the Errors page from one.newrelic.com > (select an app) > Events > Errors. Browser monitoring data If you install the browser agent via an APM agent, you can automatically link the browser-monitored app to the APM-monitored app. Once the browser agent is set up, the APM Summary page provides summary information and direct links to detailed information on the app's corresponding browser summary page. To view chart details with browser page load time, select the main chart's Browser link. To view the Apdex score for browsers, select the Apdex chart's Browser link. Link app performance to resources The APM Summary page shows a table with averages about your app's instances on their hosts, including: Apdex Response time Throughput Error rate CPU usage Memory Tip CPU usage percentage is calculated as though the application is running on one CPU core. For more information about this calculation, see CPU usage is over 100%. Examine app performance within system context Use any of these options to examine your app's performance within the context of your system's architecture and resources, such as individual hosts: Select your choice from the table at the bottom of the APM Summary page for infrastructure. Toggle between a table view or breakout metric details. If applicable, select your choice from the drop-down at the top of the APM Summary page for servers or JVMs. Examine details within infrastructure To help you understand the full context of your app's performance within your environment, APM includes options to view performance from inside the application, as well as from outside the application with the infrastructure agent. To view detailed information from your resources' point of view, click any host link. The link takes you directly to the infrastructure Compute page. When you click, the Compute data may not immediately appear. If that happens, follow the prompt to validate your account and complete the conversion process for the infrastructure agent. If you need additional help, get support at support.newrelic.com. Troubleshoot host link To troubleshoot the host link from the APM Summary page, use these tips: Host link from APM Summary Troubleshooting tips Your infrastructure agent is not installed on the host. Follow standard procedures to install our infrastructure agent. The application is operating within a container, and your infrastructure agent is installed on the container’s host. Set the hostname for the container to be the hostname of the underlying server. Docker containers: Run your Docker container with the argument: --uts=\"host\" Copy This will cause the container to share the UTS Linux Namespace with the underlying host. However, by using this set, a privileged container could change the host's hostname. The application is running on a Windows container, and your infrastructure agent is installed on the Windows host. To get a direct link to infrastructure metric data for your application, enable process metrics in the infrastructure agent's configuration. Your infrastructure agent is installed, but it only reports the short hostname, not the long hostname. Configure your server's hostname settings so that the infrastructure agent and the APM agent return the exact same name string. If possible, do so by editing your server's fully qualified domain name (FQDN) settings. The APM and infrastructure agents both read their hostname from the operating system's FQDN settings, so setting the hostname there ensures both agents share a single hostname.

      "body": "New Relic has APM language agents for C, Go, Java, Node.js, .NET, PHP, Python, and Ruby. Each of these offers several ways to leverage the power of distributed tracing: Quick start for standard distributed tracing (recommended): A fast way to get started Infinite Tracing: An advanced alternative to standard distributed tracing Older APM agents: Tracing options if you have older APM agents Manual instrumentation: Tips if automatic instrumentation doesn't work Tip If you want to get more background before getting started, check out these topics: How span sampling works explains distributed tracing options. Impacts to APM tells you what to expect if you are a current APM user but haven't set up distributed tracing. Quick start for standard distributed tracing (recommended): This is the best approach to set up standard distributed tracing if you haven't installed any APM agents for your services yet, or if you want to instrument additional services. Tip You'll need a New Relic account to set up distributed tracing. If you don't already have one, you can quickly create a free account. Step 1. Identify services Figure out which services you want to instrument so they each send trace data to New Relic. Step 2. Instrument each service with an APM agent We have installation assistants for a variety of languages to help you instrument each service. You should run the installation assistant for each service you want to instrument to ensure that each installation has a unique application name. To start the assistant, click the link for your language: APM: C APM: Golang APM: Java APM: .NET APM: Node.js APM: PHP APM: Python APM: Ruby Tip This quick-start approach with the installation assistant automatically enables distributed tracing for each service you run it on, but if you already have a APM agent that you want to participate in distributed tracing, you'll need to manually enable distributed tracing. See Options for older APM agents. Step 3. View traces After you instrument each of your services with APM agents, generate some traffic in your application so we can capture some traces. Here are two ways to view your traces in the UI: View traces that include a specific service Here's one way you can see traces for a particular service: Go to one.newrelic.com. Click APM in the top menu bar. Click your service. In the left navigation's Monitor section, click Distributed tracing. If you don't see the traces you want, you can filter by the trace.id. View traces across accounts This option allows you to search all traces across all New Relic accounts in your organization that you have access to. Go to one.newrelic.com. Click Browse data in the top menu bar, and then click Traces. Select your entity in the left pane. If you don't see the traces you want, you can filter by the trace.id. For more help finding your traces in the UI: Understand and use the distributed tracing UI Query distributed trace data Set up Infinite Tracing (advanced option) Standard distributed tracing for APM agents (above) captures up to 10% of your traces, but if you want us to analyze all your data and find the most relevant traces, you can set up Infinite Tracing. This alternative to standard distributed tracing is available for all APM language agents except C SDK. Tip To learn more about this feature, see Infinite Tracing. Before beginning, first ensure you meet the requirements. Step 1. Complete the instrumentation for standard distributed tracing in the quick start above The Infinite Tracing setup builds on the instrumentation step from the Quick start for standard distributed tracing. Step 2. Set up the trace observer The trace observer is a New Relic AWS-based service that collects and analyzes all your traces. Follow the instructions in Set up trace observer. When you're done, return here with your trace observer information and continue with the next step to configure the agent. Step 3: Configure the agent for Infinite Tracing Infinite Tracing configuration settings include the standard distributed tracing plus information about the trace observer. Find the settings for your language agent below: C SDK Infinite tracing is not available for C SDK. Go Here's an overview of the settings.

Manual instrumentation (If automatic instrumentation doesn't work) Recommendation: Before performing any custom instrumentation, read: How distributed tracing works Troubleshoot missing data If a service is not passing the trace header to other services, you can use the distributed tracing payload APIs to instrument the calling service and the called service. The calling service uses an API call to generate a payload, which is accepted by the called service. Instrument the calling service To instrument the calling service: Ensure the version of the APM agent that monitors the calling service supports distributed tracing. Invoke the agent API call for generating a distributed trace payload: C SDK | Go | Java | .NET | Node.js | PHP | Python | Ruby. Important To maintain proper ordering of spans in a trace, ensure you generate the payload in the context of the span that sends it. Add that payload to the call made to the destination service (for example, in a header). (Optional) Identify the call as an external call: C SDK Go Java .NET: n/a Node.js PHP: n/a Python Ruby Instrument the called service To instrument the called service: Ensure the version of the APM agent that monitors the called service supports distributed tracing. If the New Relic agent on the called service does not identify a New Relic transaction, use the agent API to declare a transaction: C SDK One way to tell that a transaction is not in progress: when newrelic_create_distributed_trace_payload() is called, a NULL pointer is returned. To solve this problem, follow the procedures to create a transaction with the C SDK. Go One way to tell that a transaction is not in progress: when Transaction.InsertDistributedTraceHeaders(h http.Header) is called, no headers are inserted. To create a transaction, see Instrument Go transactions. Java One way to tell that a transaction is not in progress: when Transaction.insertDistributedTraceHeaders(Headers) is called, no headers are inserted (this API requires agent 6.4.0+). To create a transaction, see Java agent transaction-related APIs. .NET One way to tell that a transaction is not in progress: CreateDistributedTracePayload() returns an empty payload. To create a transaction, see Introduction to .NET custom instrumentation. Node.js One way to tell that a transaction is not in progress: the Node.js agent logs will report an error similar to this: No transaction found when calling Transaction.acceptDistributedTracePayload. Copy Use startWebTransaction to create a web transaction or startBackgroundTransaction to capture a non-web transaction. PHP One way to tell that a transaction is not in progress: newrelic_insert_distributed_trace_headers() returns false. To create a transaction, see newrelic_start_transaction. Python To tell that a transaction is not in progress: when transaction = current_transaction() is run, transaction is None. Or, if result = accept_distributed_trace_payload(payload) is run, then the result is False. Use background_task to report a non-web transaction. For more on Python instrumentation, see Monitor transactions and segments. Ruby If you are using a Rack-based web framework and have enabled New Relic's Rack instrumentation, the Ruby agent will handle starting a transaction for you. For other use cases, see the add_transaction_tracer API method. Extract the payload from the call that you received (for example, in a header). Invoke the call for accepting the payload: C SDK | Go | Java | .NET | PHP | Node.js | Python | Ruby.",

The opening distributed tracing page is populated with a default list of traces, and you can quickly refine this list using these tools: Query bar Trace groups Scatter plot chart Filters Interactive histograms Tip In addition to these tools, you can also use other options mentioned in Query distributed trace data. Filter using the query bar The Find traces query bar is a quick way to narrow your search for traces. You can either start typing in the query bar or use the dropdown to create a compound query. Query returns are based on span attributes, not on trace attributes. You define spans that have certain criteria, and the search displays traces that contain those spans. If you use a multi-attribute filter, it is affected by first attribute selected. Distributed tracing reports on two types of data: transaction events and spans. When you select an attribute in the filter, the data type that attribute is attached to dictates the available attributes. For example, if you filter on an attribute that is attached to a transaction event, only transaction event attributes are available when you attempt to add filter on additional attribute values. Queries for traces are similar to NRQL (our query language). Here are the main exceptions: String values don't require quote marks (for example, you can use either appName = MyApp or appName = 'MyApp') The like operator doesn’t require % (for example, you can use either appName like product or appName like %product%). Tip Some queries that return a large number of results may return false positives. The trace list limits these incorrect results to 10% of the returned results. False positives may also result in histogram chart results that are not displayed in the trace list. Here are two query bar examples: Find traces that touch two services The query in the image below finds traces that: Pass through both WebPortal and Inventory Service applications Have an Inventory Service datastore call that takes longer than 500 ms Contains an error in any span. Go to one.newrelic.com > Apps > Distributed tracing Find error spans using the like operator The query in the image below finds traces that: Contain spans that pass through the WebPortal application and where an error occurred on any span in the WebPortal application Contain spans where the customer_user_email attribute contains a value ending with hotmail.com anywhere in the trace. Go to one.newrelic.com > Apps > Distributed tracing Trace groups The default view of distributed tracing shows traces grouped by the same root entry span. In other words, traces are grouped by the span where New Relic began recording the request. You can slide the toggle Group similar traces to turn this on and off. With trace groups you get a high-level view of traces so you can understand request behavior for groups of similar traces. This helps you understand dips or spikes in trace count, duration, and errors. When you click on one of the trace groups, you get all the standard details in context of the specific trace group you selected. Filter using the scatter plot The trace scatter plot is a quick way to search for outlying traces. This is available on the opening page of distributed tracing if you turn off the Group similar traces toggle at the top of the page. In the scatter plot, you can move the cursor across the chart to view trace details and you can click individual points to get details: Here's how you can control what's displayed in the scatter plot: In the View by dropdown, select the duration type: Back-end duration Root span duration Trace duration In Group traces by, select one of these options: Errors: Group by whether or not traces contain errors. Root service: Group by the name of the first service in traces. In a trace where Service A calls Service B and Service B calls Service C, the root service would be Service A. Root entry span: Group by the root transaction, which is the root service's endpoint. In a trace where Service A calls Service B and Service B calls Service C, the root entry span is Service A's endpoint. For example: \"Service A - GET /user/%\". Service entry span: Group by the span name of the service currently being viewed in APM. For example, for a trace where Service A calls Service B and Service B calls Service C, if you're viewing Service B in APM and select this grouping, the traces will be represented by their Service B span names. If a service has multiple spans in a trace, this grouping option will use that service's first entry point. Filters In the left pane, you can filter traces by multi-span traces, specific entities, or error types. Once you select a filter, only traces associated with that specific type are displayed. This makes it much easier to view the traces you're most interested in so you can find and fix issues faster. Trace histograms The histogram charts give you a quick understanding of trace distribution for important values, such as duration. Click Show filters at the bottom of the left pane to display the histograms. When you move the histogram sliders, they change the data displayed in the scatterplot or the trace group charts. For example, you can drag the Trace duration chart slider to show only traces over 500 ms, as shown in the histogram example below. Important Some queries that produce many results may result in false positives in histograms. This could manifest as histograms showing trace results that are not in the trace list. Trace details UI page When you select a trace from the trace list, you see a map of services (if available), and a \"waterfall\" display of that trace's spans. When you select a trace from the list of traces, you see details about it. Trace map If a trace involves more than one entity, and we have information about those entities, the trace page includes a map. For more about how that, see Maps in context. Span properties The UI indicates span properties with these icons: Span property Indicator Description Service This icon represents a span that's a service's entry point. In-process This icon represents an in-process span, which is a span that takes place within a process (as opposed to a cross-process span). Examples: middleware instrumentation, user-created spans. Datastore This icon represents a span call to a datastore. External This icon represents category representing a call to an external service made via HTTP. Browser app This icon represents a browser application span. Lambda This icon represents a span from a Lambda function. Some spans will have additional indicators: Span property Indicator Description Type of connection Solid lines indicate a direct parent-child relationship; in other words, one process or function directly calling another. A dotted line indicates a non-direct relationship. For more on relationships between spans, see Trace structure. Errors A span with an error. See How to understand span errors. Anomalous This icon represents the detection of an anomalous span. Orphaned spans Some spans may be \"orphaned,\" or separated, from the trace. These spans will appear at the bottom of the trace. For more details, see Fragmented traces. Multiple app names When beside a span name, this represents an entity that has had multiple app names set. Select this to see all app names it reports to. To search trace data by alternate app names, use the appName attribute. Client/server time difference If a span's duration indicator is not completely colored in (like in this example), it means that there is a time discrepancy between the server-side duration and the client-side duration for that activity. For details on this, see Client/server time difference. For more on the trace structure and how span properties are determined, see Trace structure. Span details pane When you select a span, a pane opens up with span details. These details can be helpful for troubleshooting performance issues. Details include: Performance charts Span attributes The span's data source Anomalous span details The span's full name What a span displays is based on its span type. For example, a datastore span's name attribute will contain the datastore query. View related logs If you are using our logs in context feature together with our log management, you can see any logs that are linked to your traces: Go to the trace details page by clicking on a trace. Click See logs in the upper-right corner. For details related to an individual log message, click directly on the message. Additional UI details Here are some additional distributed tracing UI details, rules, and limits: How to understand span errors Span-level errors show you where errors originated in a process, how they bubbled up, and where they were handled. Every span that ends with an error is shown with an error in the UI and contributes to the total error count for that trace. Here are some general tips about understanding span errors: Spans with errors are highlighted red in the distributed tracing UI. You can see more information on the Error Details pane for each span. All spans that exit with errors are counted in the span error count. When multiple errors occur on the same span, only one is written to the span in this order of precedence: A noticeError The most recent span error within the scope of that span This table describes how different span errors are handled: Error type Description Spans ending in errors An error that leaves the boundary of a span results in an error on that span and on any ancestor spans that also exit with an error, until the error is caught or exits the transaction. You can see if an error is caught in an ancestor span. Notice errors Errors noticed by calls to the agent noticeError API or by the automatic agent instrumentation are attached to the currently executing span. Response code errors Response code errors are attached to the associated span, such as: Client span: External transactions prefixed with http or db. Entry span: In the case of a transaction ending in a response code error. The response code for these spans is captured as an attribute httpResponseCode and attached to that span. OpenTelemetry Errors The Error Details box of the right pane is populated by spans containing otel.status_code = ERROR and displays the content of otel.status_description. Tip OpenTelemetry span events handled by the app/service are displayed independently of span error status and are not necessarily associated with a span error status. You can view span event exceptions and non-exceptions by clicking View span events in the right pane. Anomalous spans If a span is displayed as anomalous in the UI, it means that the following are both true: The span is more than two standard deviations slower than the average of all spans with the same name from the same service over the last six hours. The span's duration is more than 10% of the trace's duration. Client span duration: time differences between client and server spans When a process calls another process, and both processes are instrumented by New Relic, the trace contains both a client-side representation of the call and a server-side representation. The client span (calling process) can have time-related differences when compared to the server span (called process). These differences could be due to: Clock skew, due to system clock time differences Differences in duration, due to things like network latency or DNS resolution delay The UI shows these time-related differences by displaying an outline of the client span in the same space as the server span. This span represents the duration of the client span. It isn't possible to determine every factor contributing to these time-related discrepancies, but here are some common span patterns and tips for understanding them: When a client span is longer than the server span, this could be due to latency in a number of areas, such as: network time, queue time, DNS resolution time, or from a load balancer that we cannot see. When a client span starts and ends before a server span begins, this could be due to clock skew, or due to the server doing asynchronous work that continues after sending the response. When a client span starts after a server span, this is most likely clock skew. Fragmented traces Fragmented traces are traces with missing spans. When a span is missing or has invalid parent span IDs, its children spans become separated from the rest of the trace, which we refer to as \"orphaned.\" Orphaned spans appear at the bottom of the trace, and they will lack connecting lines to the rest of the trace. Types of orphaned span properties indicated in the UI: No root span. Missing the root span, which is the first operation in the request. When this happens, the span with the earliest timestamp is displayed as the root. Orphaned span. A single span with a missing parent span. This could be due to the parent span having an ID that doesn't match its child span. Orphaned trace fragment. A group of connected spans where the first span in the group is an orphan span. This can happen for a number of reasons, including: Collection limits. Some high-throughput applications may exceed collection limits (for example, APM agent collection limits, or API limits). When this happens, it may result in traces having missing spans. One way to remedy this is to turn off some reporting, so that the limit is not reached. Incorrect instrumentation. If an application is instrumented incorrectly, it won't pass trace context correctly and this will result in fragmented traces. To remedy this, examine the data source that is generating orphan spans to ensure instrumentation is done correctly. To discover a span's data source, select it and examine its span details. Spans still arriving. If some parent spans haven't been collected yet, this can result in temporary gaps until the entire trace has reported. UI display limits. Orphaned spans may result if a trace exceeds the 10K span display limit. Trace details obfuscated based on account access If you don’t have access to the New Relic accounts that monitor other services, some of the span and service details will be obfuscated in the UI. Obfuscation can include: Span name concealed by asterisks Service name replaced with New Relic account ID and app ID For more information on the factors affecting your access to accounts, see Account access. Span limits and sampling See Sampling. Incomplete span names in waterfall view When viewing the span waterfall, span names may be displayed in an incomplete form that is more human-readable than the complete span name. To find the complete name, select that span and look for the Full span name. Knowing the complete name can be valuable for querying that data with NRQL. Missing spans and span/service count discrepancies A trace may sometimes have (or seem to have) missing spans or services. This can manifest as a discrepancy between the count of a trace's spans or services displayed in the trace list and the count displayed on the trace details page. Reasons for missing spans and count discrepancies include: An APM agent may have hit its 1K span collection limit. A span may be initially counted but not make it into a trace display, for reasons such as network latency or a query issue. The UI may have hit its 10K span display limit. All spans collected, including those not displayed, can be queried with NRQL.",

      "body": "Information about Trace API data requirements, including: Data specifications and max limits Required metadata (headers, query parameters) Response validation details This document applies to the Trace API overall. For rules regarding specific data formats, see: New Relic-format trace data Zipkin-format trace data Endpoints All trace data is sent via HTTPS POST to a Trace API endpoint. We have a few endpoints, depending on your setup: Default Trace API endpoint: https://trace-api.newrelic.com/trace/v1 EU data centers: https://trace-api.eu.newrelic.com/trace/v1 (see other EU endpoints). Infinite Tracing: when you complete the Trace observer setup, you get a custom YOUR_TRACE_OBSERVER_URL value to use as an endpoint. If you're using an integration that uses the Trace API (for example, these integrations), you must configure that integration with that endpoint. You will also want to adjust the sampling of your tracing service to send us 100% of spans. For FedRAMP, see FedRAMP endpoints. Data formats Currently, the Trace API accepts two types of data formats: zipkin: For reporting Zipkin trace data. Zipkin data must be Zipkin JSON v2. newrelic: For reporting all other trace data. Restricted attributes The attributes in the table below are restricted in the newrelic-format JSON (in the attributes block) and in the zipkin-format JSON (in the tags block). Any values with these keys will be omitted: Restricted attribute Description entityGuid string Unique identifier for the entity that created this span. Generated from service.name, if available. guid string Used for backwards compatibility with data from APM agents. The attributes in the table below are used internally to identify entities. Any values submitted with these keys in the attributes section of a metric data point may cause undefined behavior such as missing entities in the UI or telemetry not associating with the expected entities. For more information please refer to Entity synthesis: Restricted attribute description entity.guid string Unique identifier for the entity associated with this span. entity.name string Human-readable name of an entity, often used to identify an entity in the UI. entity.type string Used to differentiate between different types of entities, like hosts, applications, etc. Request metadata (headers and query parameters) The following table shows the required request metadata for all trace data formats. This metadata can be sent as HTTP headers on an ingest request or, in some cases, provided as query parameters, which may be required for tracing frameworks that don't allow header modification. Important Security note: We suggest using headers because query parameters are present in the URL and may be logged before being encrypted and received by New Relic. All data sent as query parameters must be URL-safe. Header Query param? Details Content-Type No Required. Must be application/json. Content-Length No Required. The length of the request body in octets (8-bit bytes) unless sent with chunked encoding. This header is generally set by default by the underlying HTTP client sending the data and in most cases should not require any additional effort by the end user. Api-Key Yes (case-sensitive) Required. The Trace API requires a license key. If this is provided as both a header and a query parameter, the values must match. Content-Encoding No Required if compressed payload. The value must be gzip. Data-Format Yes Required for zipkin. Optional for newrelic. If present, Data-Format-Version must also be present. Data-Format-Version Yes Required for zipkin. If present, Data-Format must also be present. There are only two possible pairings for these values: If Data-Format is zipkin, Data-Format-Version must be 2. If Data-Format is newrelic, Data-Format-Version must be 1. x-request-id No Optional - Reserved for future use. The value must be a valid UUID4. The value is expected to be unique for each request. Response validation A response for successfully sending trace data will include a requestId. For example: {\"requestId\":\"c1bb62fc-001a-b000-0000-016bb152e1bb\"} Copy There are two ways success/errors are signaled: HTTP status code (synchronous). Authentication and request errors will be signaled via HTTP status code. See HTTP status codes Code Meaning 202 Data accepted. This means that you've passed preliminary checks, but is not a guarantee that the data has been successfully parsed and indexed as part of a distributed trace. 400 The structure of the request was invalid. Errors with query parameters, etc. 403 Authentication error. May occur with an invalid license key or if you lack necessary entitlement to use the Trace API. 404 The request path is incorrect. 405 For any request method other than POST. 408 The request took too long to reach the endpoint. 411 The Content-Length header wasn’t included. 413 The payload was too big. 414 The request URI was too long. 415 The Content-Type or Content-Encoding was invalid. 429 The request rate quota has been exceeded. 431 The request headers are too long. 5xx There was a server error (please retry). NrIntegrationError events (asynchronous). Errors with the JSON payload or other semantic errors are asynchronously signaled via NrIntegrationError events that are stored in the account whose license key is associated with the request. For all errors of this type, the attribute newRelicFeature will be Distributed Tracing and requestId will be the requestId from the endpoint response. If you receive a 202 response and don't see an NrIntegrationError event, your data should be visible in New Relic One's global distributed tracing UI in about a minute. You should be able to find the trace using a standard trace search like: traceId = TRACE_ID_SENT Copy Data limits Distributed tracing rate limits are set per account and data type. For details about data limits, see New Relic data usage limits and policies. When you exceed your span rate limit, an NrIntegrationError event is generated. You can query rate limit messages with this NRQL: SELECT * FROM NrIntegrationError WHERE newRelicFeature = 'Distributed Tracing' AND category = 'RateLimit' AND rateLimitType = 'SpansPerMinute' Copy To get a notification when you exceed the limit, you can set up a NRQL alert. We calculate a rolling 10-minute average based on your span rate limit. This allows for temporary rate bursts, and lets us prioritize keeping and dropping complete traces instead of indiscriminately dropping spans on a per minute limit basis. In the example below of exceeding the rate, the rate limit is the default 100,000 spans per minute. New Relic allows a burst above 100K for a couple of minutes without downsampling, because the remaining minutes in the 10-minute window averaged under 100K spans/minute. For the previous 10 minutes (8:50 - 9:00) the service received 60,000 spans/minute. Minute Spans sent to API Total for past 10 minutes 8:59 60,000 600,000 9:00 40,000 580,000 9:01 50,000 570,000 9:02 250,000 760,000 9:03 220,000 920,000 9:04 125,000 985,000 9:05 70,000 995,000 9:06 50,000 985,000 9:07 40,000 965,000 9:08 40,000 945,000 9:09 40,000 925,000",

      "body": "Problem CPU percent usage data between APM and infrastructure seems contradictory, or your CPU usage exceeds 100%. Cause CPU usage data for APM is different than CPU usage data for infrastructure. In APM, CPU percent usage measures aggregate usage of all instances of an application or service on a given server. In Infrastructure, CPU percent usage is measured differently depending on if you are viewing CPU usage in relation to hosts, or to processes. APM To view your app's CPU usage: Go to one.newrelic.com > (select an app) and see the CPU usage in the hosts list. The number of instances is listed under each host name (for example, 55 instances). APM CPU percent usage measures aggregate CPU usage of all instances of your app or service on a given server. This percentage is affected by the number of instances running across cores on the server. Multiple instances of a service running on one server or in a multi-core environment can produce CPU usage percentages well above 100%. APM calculates the percentage by aggregating CPU time and dividing by clock time: CPU usage = (instance CPU time + instance CPU time + [...]) / (clock time) Copy Example: Upgrading to a quad core processor If you upgrade from a dual processor to a quad processor under the same architecture, you should see roughly the same CPU numbers for the same loads and applications. If New Relic normalized the calculation, the upgrade would appear to produce an abrupt decrease in your CPU usage, even if the number of cycles you are using would be the same. Adding more instances does not make your code more efficient. New Relic Infrastructure To view your individual host CPU usage: Go to one.newrelic.com > Infrastructure and see CPU %. See individual CPU usage in the hosts list. The exact calculation for CPU usage is measured differently depending on if you are viewing CPU usage in relation to hosts, or to processes: Page Calculation details Hosts On the Hosts page, CPU Percent is a derived metric that is part of the SystemSample event. The CPU percentage is not collected by New Relic, but derived from several other metrics. Specifically, the cpuPercent attribute is an aggregation of cpuUserPercent, cpuSystemPercent, cpuIoWaitPercent and cpuStealPercent. The Hosts page shows metrics from a perspective of your whole system. For example, if a server has 32 cores installed and is showing cpuPercent of 50%, 16 of the 32 cores are being used. Processes On the Processes page, CPU percent is scoped to individual processes, rather than hosts. Because of this, the CPU percent metric does not take into account the resources of the entire system. Instead, it shows how much of a single CPU core each process is taking. For example, with a 32-core server, a process showing cpuPercent of 50% is only taking half of a single core, or about 1.5625% of the CPU cycles available on the whole server. This can result in cpuPercent exceeding 100% on the Processes page. When this occurs, the process is demanding more than a single core’s worth of CPU cycles.",

SLA tips Comments Requirements When using the cURL command examples, be sure to replace the placeholder text with your account ID, an API key, and the application ID. Time ranges You are not limited to standard day, week, or month time ranges. For example, you can extract metric data for a \"holiday weekend\" from 12/23 to 12/26 or \"the 20 minutes after our site had problems\" or whatever other period interests you. UTC XML time format You must specify the time in UTC XML format, so be sure to adjust for your time zone compared to UTC. For example, New Relic starts at 16:00:00 on the day before the selected data, since New Relic headquarters are in UTC-8. Summary reports When requesting metrics to use with summary reports, include the query string parameter summarize=true (v2) or summary=1 (v1) as shown in the examples. Scaled statistics Your report has some statistics that are scaled in the SLA reports in New Relic's user interface. New Relic changes the scale of page views in your report to show small numbers. Depending on your traffic, typically it might be displayed in thousands, millions, or billions. Recommendation: To avoid a string of zeroes, divide this number appropriately for your own purposes. End user statistics End user statistics will reflect only the calls in which the agent gathered browser data. For example, end user stats may not appear in situations such as: Browser types Clients (they might have disabled the JavaScript agent, or blocked traffic to New Relic sites for JavaScript code's location Transactions not in one of those categories, in case the page load did not complete for any reason This is why there are fewer (sometimes many fewer) page views in the End User (browser) data section than in the App server data section. Examples The following sections contain code examples to acquire the data for values described above for the Daily (24hr) SLA statistics in the default GMT/UTC time zone.

These may be web transactions or non-web transactions that are important to your business. For most New Relic agents, a key transaction can be any type of transaction. For the PHP, Node.js, and Go agents, only web transactions can be turned into key transactions. What are key transactions? In APM, making a transaction a key transaction gives you the following benefits: Key transactions are grouped together in the New Relic UI, so they are easy to find and examine. You can set a custom Apdex threshold for a key transaction. You can set an alert policy for a key transaction. Key transactions are useful for: Important transactions. For your app's most important transactions, making them key transactions means you can quickly find and examine them. You can set stricter Apdex requirements for them, and you can create alert policies for them. Slow transactions. If a transaction is regularly slower than other transactions, it can bring down the Apdex score of the entire application. When you make a transaction a key transaction, you can set a longer-duration Apdex threshold for it so it won't bring down your app's Apdex score. Create key transactions To create key transactions, see Create and update key transactions. View key transactions in UI The key transaction's page includes response time and throughput charts, service-level agreement information, a cross application tracing map (if available), and links to alert policy options.

These may be web transactions or non-web transactions that are important to your business. For most New Relic agents, a key transaction can be any type of transaction. For the PHP, Node.js, and Go agents, only web transactions can be turned into key transactions. What are key transactions? In APM, making a transaction a key transaction gives you the following benefits: Key transactions are grouped together in the New Relic UI, so they are easy to find and examine. You can set a custom Apdex threshold for a key transaction. You can set an alert policy for a key transaction. Key transactions are useful for: Important transactions. For your app's most important transactions, making them key transactions means you can quickly find and examine them. You can set stricter Apdex requirements for them, and you can create alert policies for them. Slow transactions. If a transaction is regularly slower than other transactions, it can bring down the Apdex score of the entire application. When you make a transaction a key transaction, you can set a longer-duration Apdex threshold for it so it won't bring down your app's Apdex score. Create key transactions To create key transactions, see Create and update key transactions. View key transactions in UI The key transaction's page includes response time and throughput charts, service-level agreement information, a cross application tracing map (if available), and links to alert policy options. The key transaction index is a list of your key transactions: Go to one.newrelic.com > More > Key transactions > (select a transaction). Select a Key transaction from the index.

SLA tips Comments Requirements When using the cURL command examples, be sure to replace the placeholder text with your account ID, an API key, and the application ID. Time ranges You are not limited to standard day, week, or month time ranges. For example, you can extract metric data for a \"holiday weekend\" from 12/23 to 12/26 or \"the 20 minutes after our site had problems\" or whatever other period interests you. UTC XML time format You must specify the time in UTC XML format, so be sure to adjust for your time zone compared to UTC. For example, New Relic starts at 16:00:00 on the day before the selected data, since New Relic headquarters are in UTC-8. Summary reports When requesting metrics to use with summary reports, include the query string parameter summarize=true (v2) or summary=1 (v1) as shown in the examples. Scaled statistics Your report has some statistics that are scaled in the SLA reports in New Relic's user interface. New Relic changes the scale of page views in your report to show small numbers. Depending on your traffic, typically it might be displayed in thousands, millions, or billions. Recommendation: To avoid a string of zeroes, divide this number appropriately for your own purposes.

      "body": "In APM, you can make a transaction a key transaction when you want it to have a custom level of monitoring, or when you want it to have its own alert policy. These may be web transactions or non-web transactions that are important to your business. For most New Relic agents, a key transaction can be any type of transaction. For the PHP, Node.js, and Go agents, only web transactions can be turned into key transactions. What are key transactions? In APM, making a transaction a key transaction gives you the following benefits: Key transactions are grouped together in the New Relic UI, so they are easy to find and examine. You can set a custom Apdex threshold for a key transaction. You can set an alert policy for a key transaction. Key transactions are useful for: Important transactions. For your app's most important transactions, making them key transactions means you can quickly find and examine them. You can set stricter Apdex requirements for them, and you can create alert policies for them. Slow transactions. If a transaction is regularly slower than other transactions, it can bring down the Apdex score of the entire application. When you make a transaction a key transaction, you can set a longer-duration Apdex threshold for it so it won't bring down your app's Apdex score. Create key transactions To create key transactions, see Create and update key transactions. View key transactions in UI The key transaction's page includes response time and throughput charts, service-level agreement information, a cross application tracing map (if available), and links to alert policy options. The key transaction index is a list of your key transactions: Go to one.newrelic.com > More > Key transactions > (select a transaction). Select a Key transaction from the index.

      "body": "Our .NET agent supports both .NET Framework and .NET Core. Here we describe the compatibility and support for .NET Framework applications. For .NET Core, see Compatibility and requirements for .NET Core. The agent includes built-in instrumentation for some of the most popular parts of the .NET Framework ecosystem, including frameworks, databases, and message queuing systems. After you download and install the agent, it runs within the monitored process. The agent does not create a separate process or service. For frameworks and libraries that are not automatically instrumented, you can extend the agent with .NET custom instrumentation. Want to try out New Relic's .NET agent? Create a New Relic account for free! No credit card required. Requirements Before you install New Relic's .NET agent, make sure your system meets these requirements: .NET Framework version .NET Framework 4.5 or higher .NET Framework 4.5 or higher requires the New Relic .NET agent version 7.0 or higher. .NET Framework 4.0 or lower To instrument applications running on .NET Framework version 4.0 and lower, you must run a version of the New Relic .NET agent earlier than 7.0. For more information and download procedures, see Technical support for .NET frameworks 4.0 or earlier. Here are additional details about .NET Framework versions 4.0 and lower: .NET Framework version Notes .NET Framework 2.0 Unless you have installed only .NET Framework 4.0 or higher, you must have .NET Framework version 3.5 installed on the target host, in addition to any other .NET Framework versions you have installed. .NET Framework 3.0 Unless you have installed only .NET Framework 4.0 or higher, you must have .NET Framework version 3.5 installed on the target host, in addition to any other .NET Framework versions you have installed. .NET Framework 3.5 Fully supported by .NET agent versions below 7.0. .NET Framework 4.0 Fully supported by .NET agent versions below 7.0. If you use .NET Framework 1.1 for any app on your target system, you must disable instrumentation of that app with applicationPool set to instrument=\"false\". The .NET agent can cause crashes in .NET 1.1 apps. App/web servers You must use one of these app/web servers: IIS Self-hosted OWIN Self-hosted WCF Kestrel Kestrel with IIS reverse proxy via AspNetCoreModule Kestrel with IIS reverse proxy via AspNetCoreModuleV2 The agent automatically creates transactions for apps hosted in IIS. If you self-host with WCF and OWIN version 3 or higher, the agent also automatically creates transactions. For other self-hosted services, you will need to create transactions via custom instrumentation. CLRs The agent requires CLR version 4.0. Legacy applications running on CLR 2.0 can be instrumented with agent versions earlier than 7.0. Operating system The agent requires one of these operating systems: Windows Server 2008 Windows Server 2008 R2 Windows Server 2012 Windows Server 2012 R2 Windows Server 2016 Windows Server 2019 Windows 10 Windows Azure (OS Family 1, 2, and 3) Windows containers running on Windows 2016 (NanoServer based images are not supported) Use of other monitoring software The .NET Common Language Runtime (CLR) only allows one profiler to access the profiling API of a process at any given time. Running our .NET agent alongside other monitoring software will result in a profiler conflict. For more information, see Errors while using other APM software. Microsoft Azure For Azure-specific installation instructions, see: Install on Azure Cloud Services Install on Azure Service Fabric Install on Azure Web Apps Processor architectures The agent is available in both a 32-bit and 64-bit version. On 64-bit systems, the 64-bit agent can instrument both 32-bit and 64-bit applications. Permissions Installation requires elevated privileges (Administrator). For example, you can: Be logged in as an administrator user. Be a member of the Administrators group. On newer operating systems, provide elevation credentials when prompted. The monitored process must have read/write access to the directory in which the agent is installed. The agent runs as a part of the monitored process and relies on those permissions to function. Recommendation: Restrict permissions for the newrelic.config file and give read/write access only to the owner of the monitored process. Review permissions for the logs created by the agent to minimize the number of users with access and their privileges. Security requirements As a standard security measure for data collection, your app server must support SHA-2 (256-bit). SHA-1 is not supported. Code Access Security The use of Code Access Security is compatible with the .NET agent only when Full Trust is provided. The agent is not compatible with more restrictive trust levels. Network requirements The agent requires your firewall to allow outgoing connections to specific networks and ports. Application lifespan The .NET agent uploads data at the end of each harvest cycle (once per minute). If your .NET app doesn't run that long, you can set the service element's sendDataOnExit attribute to true in the newrelic.config file. Automatic instrumentation If your application is hosted in ASP.NET or another fully supported framework, the .NET agent will automatically instrument your application after install. If your app is not automatically instrumented, or if you want to add instrumentation, use custom instrumentation. The .NET agent does not directly monitor datastore processes. Also, by default the .NET SQL parameter capture in a query trace does not list parameters for a parameterized query or a stored procedure. Collection of the SQL query parameters can be enabled in the agent configuration. App frameworks The agent automatically instruments some application frameworks; we refer to these frameworks as fully supported. Compatibility status .NET app frameworks Fully supported These frameworks are fully supported: ASP.NET MVC 2 ASP.NET MVC 3 ASP.NET MVC 4 ASP.NET MVC 5 ASP.NET Web API v2 ASP.NET Core MVC 2.0 ASP.NET Core 2.1 ASP.NET Core 2.2 ASP.NET Web Forms Castle MonoRail v2 (not the same as Mono) OWIN-hosted web API applications on .NET framework using: Microsoft.Owin.Host.HttpListener v2.x Microsoft.Owin.Host.HttpListener v3.x Microsoft.Owin.Host.HttpListener v4.x SOAP-based web services WCF Hosting Models IIS Hosted (with and without ASP Compatibility) Self Hosted Binding Types (both client and service) WCF Instrumentation has been tested for the following common binding types. Varying levels of support are available for distributed tracing (DT) and cross application tracing (CAT): Binding Distributed Tracing (DT) Support Cross Application Tracing (CAT) Support BasicHTTP supported supported WebHTTP supported supported WSHTTP supported supported NetTCP supported supported NetNamedPipe not supported * not supported * NetMSMQ not supported * not supported * * Distributed tracing may be manually implemented using these Distributed Tracing API methods. Invocation Methods (both client and service) Synchronous Asynchronous Processing Model (APM) Begin/End Task Asynchronous Processing (TAP) Event-based Asynchronous Processing (EAP) Client support only. Not fully supported These frameworks are not fully supported: ASP.NET Web API v1: See the troubleshooting information about using ASP.NET Web API v1 with New Relic's .NET agent 5.0 or higher for apps targeting .NET Framework 4.0. (This does not affect .NET Framework 4.5 or higher.) Mono: New Relic does not support Mono, an open-source .NET framework that runs on Linux. This is because there is no Profiler API to inject into the .NET agent as a profiler into Mono-based .NET applications. The Profiler API is a Component Object Model (COM)-based interface and is not supported on Linux. Not supported Classic ASP is not supported, because the agent can only instrument .NET Framework-based apps. Sharepoint is not supported. Datastores Collecting instance details for supported datastores requires .NET agent version 6.5.29.0 or higher and is enabled by default. To request instance-level information from datastores not currently listed, get support at support.newrelic.com. In order to automatically instrument the performance of .NET Framework application calls to these datastores, make sure you have the .NET agent version 8.14 or higher: Datastore Instance details Other notes Couchbase SDK version 2.x.x (2.4.0 or higher is not supported). With Couchbase, the following are not instrumented by default in favor of their multi-document counterparts: Get(string key) GetDocument(string key) Remove(string key) Remove(string key, ulong cas) Upsert<T>(string key, T value) IBM DB2 Microsoft SQL Server MongoDB We support both the modern and legacy MongoDB drivers. Legacy - mongocsharpdriver Driver versions 1.10.0 or earlier: Instance details are not available in these driver versions. Modern - MongoDB.Driver Driver version 2.3.x, 2.4.x, 2.5.x, or 2.6.x Driver version 2.7.x: The .NET agent does not support API methods introduced by driver version 2.7.x, but does support pre-existing methods from previous versions. MySQL Use MySql.Data version 6.10.4 or later, or use the MySQL Connector Oracle PostgreSQL Use Npgsql 4.0. Prior versions of Npgsql may also be instrumented, but duplicate and/or missing metrics are possible. ServiceStack.Redis StackExchange.Redis Messaging The agent automatically instruments these message systems: MSMQ: Puts and takes on messages NServiceBus 5.0 (6.0 or higher not supported): Puts and takes on messages and cross application tracing RabbitMQ 3.5 or higher: Puts and takes on messages and queue purge. When receiving messages using an IBasicConsumer, the EventingBasicConsumer is the only implementation that is instrumented by the .NET agent. BasicGet is instrumented, but the agent does not support distributed tracing for BasicGet. The following methods are instrumented: IModel.BasicGet IModel.BasicPublish IModel.BasicComsume IModel.QueuePurge EventingBasicConsumer.HandleBasicDeliver CMS The agent automatically instruments the EPiServer content management system. External call libraries The agent automatically instruments these external call libraries : Libraries Supported methods HttpClient The agent instruments these HttpClient methods: SendAsync GetAsync PostAsync PutAsync DeleteAsync GetStringAsync GetStreamAsync GetByteArrayAsync RestSharp The agent instruments these RestSharp methods: ExecuteTaskAsync ExecuteGetTaskAsync ExecutePostTaskAsync Execute ExecuteAsGet ExecuteAsPost DownloadData HttpWebRequest The agent instruments these HttpWebRequest methods: GetResponse Connect the agent to other New Relic products In addition to APM, the agent integrates with other New Relic products to give you end-to-end visibility: Product Integration Browser monitoring For ASP.NET applications, the .NET agent automatically injects the browser JavaScript agent when you enable auto-instrumentation. After enabling browser injection, you can view browser data in the APM Summary page and quickly switch between the APM and browser data for a particular app. For configuration options and manual instrumentation, see Browser monitoring and the .NET agent. Automatic browser injection is not supported for ASP.NET core applications. Infrastructure monitoring When you install the Infrastructure and APM agents on the same host, they automatically detect one another. You can then view a list of hosts in the APM UI, and filter your Infrastructure hosts by APM app in the Infrastructure UI. For more information, see APM data in Infrastructure. Dashboards The .NET agent sends default events and attributes for NRQL queries. You can also record custom events for advanced analysis.

      "body": "New Relic's .NET agent supports both .NET Framework and .NET Core. This document describes compatibility and support for .NET Core applications. See Compatibility and requirements for .NET Framework for .NET Framework applications. New Relic's .NET agent includes built-in instrumentation for some of the most popular parts of the .NET Core ecosystem, including frameworks, databases, and message queuing systems. After installation, the agent runs within the monitored process; there is not a separate process or service created by the agent. For frameworks and libraries that are not automatically instrumented out of the box, you can extend the agent with .NET custom instrumentation. Want to try out our .NET agent? Create a New Relic account for free! No credit card required. Requirements Before you install the New Relic .NET agent on Windows or Linux, make sure your system meets these requirements: Microsoft .NET Core version The .NET agent supports .NET Core versions 2.0, 2.1, 2.2, 3.0, 3.1, and .NET 5.0. Table of minimum agent versions required per .NET Core version .NET Core Version Minimum Required .NET Agent Version .NET Core 2.0 > = 8.19.353.0 .NET Core 2.1 > = 8.19.353.0 .NET Core 2.2 > = 8.19.353.0 .NET Core 3.0 > = 8.21.34.0 .NET Core 3.1 > = 8.21.34.0 .NET 5.0 > = 8.35.0 The agent is not compatible with .NET Core versions 1.0 or 1.1. For .NET Core 2.1 or higher applications with tiered compilation enabled, the agent will disable tiered compilation. .NET Core 2.1 support requires .NET Core runtime 2.1.3 and .NET Core SDK 2.1.401 or higher due to a bug in the .NET Core profiling API. Target framework version The .NET agent only supports applications targeting .NET Core 2.0, 2.1, 2.2, 3.0, 3.1, and NET 5.0. You can find the target framework in your .csproj file: Supported: <TargetFramework>netcoreapp2.0</TargetFramework> Copy <TargetFramework>netcoreapp2.1</TargetFramework> Copy <TargetFramework>netcoreapp2.2</TargetFramework> Copy <TargetFramework>netcoreapp3.0</TargetFramework> Copy <TargetFramework>netcoreapp3.1</TargetFramework> Copy <TargetFramework>net5.0</TargetFramework> Copy Unsupported: <TargetFramework>net452</TargetFramework> Copy Important If you want to monitor an ASP.NET Core application targeting .NET Framework, ensure your install of the .NET agent has .NET Framework support enabled. App/web servers Ensure you use one of these app/web servers: Kestrel Kestrel with IIS reverse proxy via AspNetCoreModule Kestrel with IIS reverse proxy via AspNetCoreModuleV2 Kestrel with Nginx reverse proxy Kestrel with Apache reverse proxy Operating system The agent has been verified to work with the following operating systems: Operating system Supported versions Windows (32- and 64-bit Intel compatible architectures) Server 2008 R2 SP1 Server 2012 Server 2012 R2 Server 2016 Server 2019 Windows containers running on Server 2016 (NanoServer based images are not supported) Linux (64-bit Intel compatible only) All x64 Linux distributions supported by the .NET Core 2.0+/.NET 5 runtime are supported by the .NET agent. For a full list, refer to Microsoft's documentation for the version of the runtime you are using. Microsoft Azure For Azure-specific installation instructions, see: Install on Azure Cloud Services Install on Azure Service Fabric Install on Azure Web Apps Processor architectures The agent is available in both 32-bit (x86) and 64-bit (x64) versions on Windows as well as 64-bit (x64) on Linux. Permissions Installing and running the .NET agent requires these permissions: Component Necessary permissions Install the agent The process or user that installs the agent must have sufficient permissions to set environment variables and write access to the directory where the agent is installed. Run the agent The monitored process must have read/write access to the directory in which you installed the agent. The agent runs as a part of the monitored process and relies on those permissions to function. For applications using IIS via reverse proxy, the group IIS_IUSRS is often used. Security requirements As a standard security measure for data collection, your app server must support SHA-2 (256-bit). SHA-1 is not supported. Network requirements The agent requires your firewall to allow outgoing connections to specific networks and ports. Automatic instrumentation If your application is hosted in ASP.NET Core, the agent automatically creates and instruments transactions. The .NET agent will automatically instrument your application after install. If your app is not automatically instrumented, or if you want to add instrumentation, use custom instrumentation. App frameworks The .NET agent automatically instruments these application frameworks: ASP.NET Core MVC 2.0, 2.1, 2.2, 3.0, 3.1, and 5.0 (includes Web API) Datastores The .NET agent automatically instruments the performance of .NET application calls to these datastores: Datastore Instance details Notes Microsoft SQL Server Use System.Data.SqlClient version 4.3.1 or Microsoft.Data.SqlClient. PostgresSQL Use Npgsql 4.0. Prior versions of Npgsql may also be instrumented, but duplicate and/or missing metrics are possible. MongoDB Use driver version 2.3.x, 2.4.x, 2.5.x, or 2.6.x. Driver version 2.7.x: The .NET agent does not support API methods introduced by driver version 2.7.x, but does support pre-existing methods from previous versions. MySQL Use MySql.Data version 6.10.4 or later, or use the MySQL Connector StackExchange.Redis The .NET agent does not directly monitor datastore processes. Also, the .NET SQL parameter capture in a query trace does not list parameters for a parameterized query or a stored procedure. Collecting instance details for supported datastores is enabled by default. To request instance-level information from datastores not currently listed, get support at support.newrelic.com. External call libraries The .NET agent automatically instruments these external call libraries : Libraries Supported methods HttpClient The agent instruments these HttpClient methods: SendAsync GetAsync PostAsync PutAsync DeleteAsync GetStringAsync GetStreamAsync GetByteArrayAsync Messaging The agent automatically instruments these message systems: RabbitMQ 5.1.0 or higher: Puts and takes on messages and queue purge. When receiving messages using an IBasicConsumer, the EventingBasicConsumer is the only implementation that is instrumented by the .NET agent. BasicGet is instrumented, but the agent does not support distributed tracing for BasicGet. The following methods are instrumented: IModel.BasicGet IModel.BasicPublish IModel.BasicComsume IModel.QueuePurge EventingBasicConsumer.HandleBasicDeliver Unavailable features The following features are not available for the .NET agent: Memory usage on Linux due to an ongoing .NET Core issue (try using .NET performance metrics to get this information) Automatic brower monitoring script injection (API or manual instrumentation is required) The .NET agent does not support trim self-contained deployments and executables, because the compiler can potentially trim assemblies that the agent depends on. Infinite Tracing is not supported on Alpine Linux due to a GRPC compatibility issue. See this agent issue for more information. Connect the agent to other New Relic products In addition to APM, the .NET agent integrates with other New Relic products to give you end-to-end visibility: Product Integration Browser monitoring The browser monitoring JavaScript agent will not be injected by the .NET agent for ASP.NET core applications. However, you can inject the browser agent by using the .NET agent API or the browser agent's copy/paste method. After enabling browser injection, you can view browser data in the APM Summary page and quickly switch between the APM and browser data for a particular app. For configuration options and manual instrumentation, see browser monitoring and the .NET agent. Infrastructure monitoring When you install the Infrastructure and APM agents on the same host, they automatically detect one another. You can then view a list of hosts in the APM UI, and filter your Infrastructure hosts by APM app in the Infrastructure UI. For more information, see APM data in Infrastructure. Dashboards The .NET agent sends default events and attributes for NRQL queries. You can also record custom events for advanced analysis.",

Create a New Relic account for free! No credit card required. Requirements Before you install New Relic's .NET agent, make sure your system meets these requirements: .NET Framework version .NET Framework 4.5 or higher .NET Framework 4.5 or higher requires the New Relic .NET agent version 7.0 or higher. .NET Framework 4.0 or lower To instrument applications running on .NET Framework version 4.0 and lower, you must run a version of the New Relic .NET agent earlier than 7.0. For more information and download procedures, see Technical support for .NET frameworks 4.0 or earlier. Here are additional details about .NET Framework versions 4.0 and lower: .NET Framework version Notes .NET Framework 2.0 Unless you have installed only .NET Framework 4.0 or higher, you must have .NET Framework version 3.5 installed on the target host, in addition to any other .NET Framework versions you have installed. .NET Framework 3.0 Unless you have installed only .NET Framework 4.0 or higher, you must have .NET Framework version 3.5 installed on the target host, in addition to any other .NET Framework versions you have installed. .NET Framework 3.5 Fully supported by .NET agent versions below 7.0. .NET Framework 4.0 Fully supported by .NET agent versions below 7.0. If you use .NET Framework 1.1 for any app on your target system, you must disable instrumentation of that app with applicationPool set to instrument=\"false\". The .NET agent can cause crashes in .NET 1.1 apps. App/web servers You must use one of these app/web servers: IIS Self-hosted OWIN Self-hosted WCF Kestrel Kestrel with IIS reverse proxy via AspNetCoreModule Kestrel with IIS reverse proxy via AspNetCoreModuleV2 The agent automatically creates transactions for apps hosted in IIS. If you self-host with WCF and OWIN version 3 or higher, the agent also automatically creates transactions. For other self-hosted services, you will need to create transactions via custom instrumentation. CLRs The agent requires CLR version 4.0. Legacy applications running on CLR 2.0 can be instrumented with agent versions earlier than 7.0. Operating system The agent requires one of these operating systems: Windows Server 2008 Windows Server 2008 R2 Windows Server 2012 Windows Server 2012 R2 Windows Server 2016 Windows Server 2019 Windows 10 Windows Azure (OS Family 1, 2, and 3) Windows containers running on Windows 2016 (NanoServer based images are not supported) Use of other monitoring software The .NET Common Language Runtime (CLR) only allows one profiler to access the profiling API of a process at any given time. Running our .NET agent alongside other monitoring software will result in a profiler conflict. For more information, see Errors while using other APM software. Microsoft Azure For Azure-specific installation instructions, see: Install on Azure Cloud Services Install on Azure Service Fabric Install on Azure Web Apps Processor architectures The agent is available in both a 32-bit and 64-bit version. On 64-bit systems, the 64-bit agent can instrument both 32-bit and 64-bit applications. Permissions Installation requires elevated privileges (Administrator). For example, you can: Be logged in as an administrator user. Be a member of the Administrators group. On newer operating systems, provide elevation credentials when prompted. The monitored process must have read/write access to the directory in which the agent is installed. The agent runs as a part of the monitored process and relies on those permissions to function. Recommendation: Restrict permissions for the newrelic.config file and give read/write access only to the owner of the monitored process. Review permissions for the logs created by the agent to minimize the number of users with access and their privileges. Security requirements As a standard security measure for data collection, your app server must support SHA-2 (256-bit). SHA-1 is not supported. Code Access Security The use of Code Access Security is compatible with the .NET agent only when Full Trust is provided. The agent is not compatible with more restrictive trust levels. Network requirements The agent requires your firewall to allow outgoing connections to specific networks and ports. Application lifespan The .NET agent uploads data at the end of each harvest cycle (once per minute). If your .NET app doesn't run that long, you can set the service element's sendDataOnExit attribute to true in the newrelic.config file. Automatic instrumentation If your application is hosted in ASP.NET or another fully supported framework, the .NET agent will automatically instrument your application after install. If your app is not automatically instrumented, or if you want to add instrumentation, use custom instrumentation. The .NET agent does not directly monitor datastore processes. Also, by default the .NET SQL parameter capture in a query trace does not list parameters for a parameterized query or a stored procedure. Collection of the SQL query parameters can be enabled in the agent configuration. App frameworks The agent automatically instruments some application frameworks; we refer to these frameworks as fully supported. Compatibility status .NET app frameworks Fully supported These frameworks are fully supported: ASP.NET MVC 2 ASP.NET MVC 3 ASP.NET MVC 4 ASP.NET MVC 5 ASP.NET Web API v2 ASP.NET Core MVC 2.0 ASP.NET Core 2.1 ASP.NET Core 2.2 ASP.NET Web Forms Castle MonoRail v2 (not the same as Mono) OWIN-hosted web API applications on .NET framework using: Microsoft.Owin.Host.HttpListener v2.x Microsoft.Owin.Host.HttpListener v3.x Microsoft.Owin.Host.HttpListener v4.x SOAP-based web services WCF Hosting Models IIS Hosted (with and without ASP Compatibility) Self Hosted Binding Types (both client and service) WCF Instrumentation has been tested for the following common binding types. Varying levels of support are available for distributed tracing (DT) and cross application tracing (CAT): Binding Distributed Tracing (DT) Support Cross Application Tracing (CAT) Support BasicHTTP supported supported WebHTTP supported supported WSHTTP supported supported NetTCP supported supported NetNamedPipe not supported * not supported * NetMSMQ not supported * not supported * * Distributed tracing may be manually implemented using these Distributed Tracing API methods. Invocation Methods (both client and service) Synchronous Asynchronous Processing Model (APM) Begin/End Task Asynchronous Processing (TAP) Event-based Asynchronous Processing (EAP) Client support only. Not fully supported These frameworks are not fully supported: ASP.NET Web API v1: See the troubleshooting information about using ASP.NET Web API v1 with New Relic's .NET agent 5.0 or higher for apps targeting .NET Framework 4.0. (This does not affect .NET Framework 4.5 or higher.) Mono: New Relic does not support Mono, an open-source .NET framework that runs on Linux. This is because there is no Profiler API to inject into the .NET agent as a profiler into Mono-based .NET applications. The Profiler API is a Component Object Model (COM)-based interface and is not supported on Linux. Not supported Classic ASP is not supported, because the agent can only instrument .NET Framework-based apps. Sharepoint is not supported. Datastores Collecting instance details for supported datastores requires .NET agent version 6.5.29.0 or higher and is enabled by default. To request instance-level information from datastores not currently listed, get support at support.newrelic.com. In order to automatically instrument the performance of .NET Framework application calls to these datastores, make sure you have the .NET agent version 8.14 or higher: Datastore Instance details Other notes Couchbase SDK version 2.x.x (2.4.0 or higher is not supported). With Couchbase, the following are not instrumented by default in favor of their multi-document counterparts: Get(string key) GetDocument(string key) Remove(string key) Remove(string key, ulong cas) Upsert<T>(string key, T value) IBM DB2 Microsoft SQL Server MongoDB We support both the modern and legacy MongoDB drivers.

Modern - MongoDB.Driver Driver version 2.3.x, 2.4.x, 2.5.x, or 2.6.x Driver version 2.7.x: The .NET agent does not support API methods introduced by driver version 2.7.x, but does support pre-existing methods from previous versions. MySQL Use MySql.Data version 6.10.4 or later, or use the MySQL Connector Oracle PostgreSQL Use Npgsql 4.0. Prior versions of Npgsql may also be instrumented, but duplicate and/or missing metrics are possible. ServiceStack.Redis StackExchange.Redis Messaging The agent automatically instruments these message systems: MSMQ: Puts and takes on messages NServiceBus 5.0 (6.0 or higher not supported): Puts and takes on messages and cross application tracing RabbitMQ 3.5 or higher: Puts and takes on messages and queue purge. When receiving messages using an IBasicConsumer, the EventingBasicConsumer is the only implementation that is instrumented by the .NET agent. BasicGet is instrumented, but the agent does not support distributed tracing for BasicGet. The following methods are instrumented: IModel.BasicGet IModel.BasicPublish IModel.BasicComsume IModel.QueuePurge EventingBasicConsumer.HandleBasicDeliver CMS The agent automatically instruments the EPiServer content management system.

      "body": "New Relic's .NET agent supports both .NET Framework and .NET Core. This document describes compatibility and support for .NET Core applications. See Compatibility and requirements for .NET Framework for .NET Framework applications. New Relic's .NET agent includes built-in instrumentation for some of the most popular parts of the .NET Core ecosystem, including frameworks, databases, and message queuing systems. After installation, the agent runs within the monitored process; there is not a separate process or service created by the agent. For frameworks and libraries that are not automatically instrumented out of the box, you can extend the agent with .NET custom instrumentation. Want to try out our .NET agent? Create a New Relic account for free! No credit card required. Requirements Before you install the New Relic .NET agent on Windows or Linux, make sure your system meets these requirements: Microsoft .NET Core version The .NET agent supports .NET Core versions 2.0, 2.1, 2.2, 3.0, 3.1, and .NET 5.0. Table of minimum agent versions required per .NET Core version .NET Core Version Minimum Required .NET Agent Version .NET Core 2.0 > = 8.19.353.0 .NET Core 2.1 > = 8.19.353.0 .NET Core 2.2 > = 8.19.353.0 .NET Core 3.0 > = 8.21.34.0 .NET Core 3.1 > = 8.21.34.0 .NET 5.0 > = 8.35.0 The agent is not compatible with .NET Core versions 1.0 or 1.1. For .NET Core 2.1 or higher applications with tiered compilation enabled, the agent will disable tiered compilation. .NET Core 2.1 support requires .NET Core runtime 2.1.3 and .NET Core SDK 2.1.401 or higher due to a bug in the .NET Core profiling API. Target framework version The .NET agent only supports applications targeting .NET Core 2.0, 2.1, 2.2, 3.0, 3.1, and NET 5.0. You can find the target framework in your .csproj file: Supported: <TargetFramework>netcoreapp2.0</TargetFramework> Copy <TargetFramework>netcoreapp2.1</TargetFramework> Copy <TargetFramework>netcoreapp2.2</TargetFramework> Copy <TargetFramework>netcoreapp3.0</TargetFramework> Copy <TargetFramework>netcoreapp3.1</TargetFramework> Copy <TargetFramework>net5.0</TargetFramework> Copy Unsupported: <TargetFramework>net452</TargetFramework> Copy Important If you want to monitor an ASP.NET Core application targeting .NET Framework, ensure your install of the .NET agent has .NET Framework support enabled. App/web servers Ensure you use one of these app/web servers: Kestrel Kestrel with IIS reverse proxy via AspNetCoreModule Kestrel with IIS reverse proxy via AspNetCoreModuleV2 Kestrel with Nginx reverse proxy Kestrel with Apache reverse proxy Operating system The agent has been verified to work with the following operating systems: Operating system Supported versions Windows (32- and 64-bit Intel compatible architectures) Server 2008 R2 SP1 Server 2012 Server 2012 R2 Server 2016 Server 2019 Windows containers running on Server 2016 (NanoServer based images are not supported) Linux (64-bit Intel compatible only) All x64 Linux distributions supported by the .NET Core 2.0+/.NET 5 runtime are supported by the .NET agent. For a full list, refer to Microsoft's documentation for the version of the runtime you are using. Microsoft Azure For Azure-specific installation instructions, see: Install on Azure Cloud Services Install on Azure Service Fabric Install on Azure Web Apps Processor architectures The agent is available in both 32-bit (x86) and 64-bit (x64) versions on Windows as well as 64-bit (x64) on Linux. Permissions Installing and running the .NET agent requires these permissions: Component Necessary permissions Install the agent The process or user that installs the agent must have sufficient permissions to set environment variables and write access to the directory where the agent is installed. Run the agent The monitored process must have read/write access to the directory in which you installed the agent. The agent runs as a part of the monitored process and relies on those permissions to function. For applications using IIS via reverse proxy, the group IIS_IUSRS is often used. Security requirements As a standard security measure for data collection, your app server must support SHA-2 (256-bit). SHA-1 is not supported. Network requirements The agent requires your firewall to allow outgoing connections to specific networks and ports. Automatic instrumentation If your application is hosted in ASP.NET Core, the agent automatically creates and instruments transactions. The .NET agent will automatically instrument your application after install. If your app is not automatically instrumented, or if you want to add instrumentation, use custom instrumentation. App frameworks The .NET agent automatically instruments these application frameworks: ASP.NET Core MVC 2.0, 2.1, 2.2, 3.0, 3.1, and 5.0 (includes Web API) Datastores The .NET agent automatically instruments the performance of .NET application calls to these datastores: Datastore Instance details Notes Microsoft SQL Server Use System.Data.SqlClient version 4.3.1 or Microsoft.Data.SqlClient. PostgresSQL Use Npgsql 4.0. Prior versions of Npgsql may also be instrumented, but duplicate and/or missing metrics are possible. MongoDB Use driver version 2.3.x, 2.4.x, 2.5.x, or 2.6.x. Driver version 2.7.x: The .NET agent does not support API methods introduced by driver version 2.7.x, but does support pre-existing methods from previous versions. MySQL Use MySql.Data version 6.10.4 or later, or use the MySQL Connector StackExchange.Redis The .NET agent does not directly monitor datastore processes. Also, the .NET SQL parameter capture in a query trace does not list parameters for a parameterized query or a stored procedure. Collecting instance details for supported datastores is enabled by default. To request instance-level information from datastores not currently listed, get support at support.newrelic.com. External call libraries The .NET agent automatically instruments these external call libraries : Libraries Supported methods HttpClient The agent instruments these HttpClient methods: SendAsync GetAsync PostAsync PutAsync DeleteAsync GetStringAsync GetStreamAsync GetByteArrayAsync Messaging The agent automatically instruments these message systems: RabbitMQ 5.1.0 or higher: Puts and takes on messages and queue purge. When receiving messages using an IBasicConsumer, the EventingBasicConsumer is the only implementation that is instrumented by the .NET agent. BasicGet is instrumented, but the agent does not support distributed tracing for BasicGet. The following methods are instrumented: IModel.BasicGet IModel.BasicPublish IModel.BasicComsume IModel.QueuePurge EventingBasicConsumer.HandleBasicDeliver Unavailable features The following features are not available for the .NET agent: Memory usage on Linux due to an ongoing .NET Core issue (try using .NET performance metrics to get this information) Automatic brower monitoring script injection (API or manual instrumentation is required) The .NET agent does not support trim self-contained deployments and executables, because the compiler can potentially trim assemblies that the agent depends on. Infinite Tracing is not supported on Alpine Linux due to a GRPC compatibility issue. See this agent issue for more information. Connect the agent to other New Relic products In addition to APM, the .NET agent integrates with other New Relic products to give you end-to-end visibility: Product Integration Browser monitoring The browser monitoring JavaScript agent will not be injected by the .NET agent for ASP.NET core applications. However, you can inject the browser agent by using the .NET agent API or the browser agent's copy/paste method. After enabling browser injection, you can view browser data in the APM Summary page and quickly switch between the APM and browser data for a particular app. For configuration options and manual instrumentation, see browser monitoring and the .NET agent. Infrastructure monitoring When you install the Infrastructure and APM agents on the same host, they automatically detect one another. You can then view a list of hosts in the APM UI, and filter your Infrastructure hosts by APM app in the Infrastructure UI. For more information, see APM data in Infrastructure.

Create a New Relic account for free! No credit card required. Requirements Before you install New Relic's .NET agent, make sure your system meets these requirements: .NET Framework version .NET Framework 4.5 or higher .NET Framework 4.5 or higher requires the New Relic .NET agent version 7.0 or higher. .NET Framework 4.0 or lower To instrument applications running on .NET Framework version 4.0 and lower, you must run a version of the New Relic .NET agent earlier than 7.0. For more information and download procedures, see Technical support for .NET frameworks 4.0 or earlier. Here are additional details about .NET Framework versions 4.0 and lower: .NET Framework version Notes .NET Framework 2.0 Unless you have installed only .NET Framework 4.0 or higher, you must have .NET Framework version 3.5 installed on the target host, in addition to any other .NET Framework versions you have installed. .NET Framework 3.0 Unless you have installed only .NET Framework 4.0 or higher, you must have .NET Framework version 3.5 installed on the target host, in addition to any other .NET Framework versions you have installed. .NET Framework 3.5 Fully supported by .NET agent versions below 7.0. .NET Framework 4.0 Fully supported by .NET agent versions below 7.0. If you use .NET Framework 1.1 for any app on your target system, you must disable instrumentation of that app with applicationPool set to instrument=\"false\". The .NET agent can cause crashes in .NET 1.1 apps. App/web servers You must use one of these app/web servers: IIS Self-hosted OWIN Self-hosted WCF Kestrel Kestrel with IIS reverse proxy via AspNetCoreModule Kestrel with IIS reverse proxy via AspNetCoreModuleV2 The agent automatically creates transactions for apps hosted in IIS. If you self-host with WCF and OWIN version 3 or higher, the agent also automatically creates transactions. For other self-hosted services, you will need to create transactions via custom instrumentation. CLRs The agent requires CLR version 4.0. Legacy applications running on CLR 2.0 can be instrumented with agent versions earlier than 7.0. Operating system The agent requires one of these operating systems: Windows Server 2008 Windows Server 2008 R2 Windows Server 2012 Windows Server 2012 R2 Windows Server 2016 Windows Server 2019 Windows 10 Windows Azure (OS Family 1, 2, and 3) Windows containers running on Windows 2016 (NanoServer based images are not supported) Use of other monitoring software The .NET Common Language Runtime (CLR) only allows one profiler to access the profiling API of a process at any given time. Running our .NET agent alongside other monitoring software will result in a profiler conflict. For more information, see Errors while using other APM software. Microsoft Azure For Azure-specific installation instructions, see: Install on Azure Cloud Services Install on Azure Service Fabric Install on Azure Web Apps Processor architectures The agent is available in both a 32-bit and 64-bit version. On 64-bit systems, the 64-bit agent can instrument both 32-bit and 64-bit applications. Permissions Installation requires elevated privileges (Administrator). For example, you can: Be logged in as an administrator user. Be a member of the Administrators group. On newer operating systems, provide elevation credentials when prompted. The monitored process must have read/write access to the directory in which the agent is installed. The agent runs as a part of the monitored process and relies on those permissions to function. Recommendation: Restrict permissions for the newrelic.config file and give read/write access only to the owner of the monitored process. Review permissions for the logs created by the agent to minimize the number of users with access and their privileges. Security requirements As a standard security measure for data collection, your app server must support SHA-2 (256-bit). SHA-1 is not supported. Code Access Security The use of Code Access Security is compatible with the .NET agent only when Full Trust is provided. The agent is not compatible with more restrictive trust levels. Network requirements The agent requires your firewall to allow outgoing connections to specific networks and ports. Application lifespan The .NET agent uploads data at the end of each harvest cycle (once per minute). If your .NET app doesn't run that long, you can set the service element's sendDataOnExit attribute to true in the newrelic.config file. Automatic instrumentation If your application is hosted in ASP.NET or another fully supported framework, the .NET agent will automatically instrument your application after install. If your app is not automatically instrumented, or if you want to add instrumentation, use custom instrumentation. The .NET agent does not directly monitor datastore processes. Also, by default the .NET SQL parameter capture in a query trace does not list parameters for a parameterized query or a stored procedure. Collection of the SQL query parameters can be enabled in the agent configuration. App frameworks The agent automatically instruments some application frameworks; we refer to these frameworks as fully supported. Compatibility status .NET app frameworks Fully supported These frameworks are fully supported: ASP.NET MVC 2 ASP.NET MVC 3 ASP.NET MVC 4 ASP.NET MVC 5 ASP.NET Web API v2 ASP.NET Core MVC 2.0 ASP.NET Core 2.1 ASP.NET Core 2.2 ASP.NET Web Forms Castle MonoRail v2 (not the same as Mono) OWIN-hosted web API applications on .NET framework using: Microsoft.Owin.Host.HttpListener v2.x Microsoft.Owin.Host.HttpListener v3.x Microsoft.Owin.Host.HttpListener v4.x SOAP-based web services WCF Hosting Models IIS Hosted (with and without ASP Compatibility) Self Hosted Binding Types (both client and service) WCF Instrumentation has been tested for the following common binding types. Varying levels of support are available for distributed tracing (DT) and cross application tracing (CAT): Binding Distributed Tracing (DT) Support Cross Application Tracing (CAT) Support BasicHTTP supported supported WebHTTP supported supported WSHTTP supported supported NetTCP supported supported NetNamedPipe not supported * not supported * NetMSMQ not supported * not supported * * Distributed tracing may be manually implemented using these Distributed Tracing API methods. Invocation Methods (both client and service) Synchronous Asynchronous Processing Model (APM) Begin/End Task Asynchronous Processing (TAP) Event-based Asynchronous Processing (EAP) Client support only. Not fully supported These frameworks are not fully supported: ASP.NET Web API v1: See the troubleshooting information about using ASP.NET Web API v1 with New Relic's .NET agent 5.0 or higher for apps targeting .NET Framework 4.0. (This does not affect .NET Framework 4.5 or higher.) Mono: New Relic does not support Mono, an open-source .NET framework that runs on Linux. This is because there is no Profiler API to inject into the .NET agent as a profiler into Mono-based .NET applications. The Profiler API is a Component Object Model (COM)-based interface and is not supported on Linux. Not supported Classic ASP is not supported, because the agent can only instrument .NET Framework-based apps. Sharepoint is not supported. Datastores Collecting instance details for supported datastores requires .NET agent version 6.5.29.0 or higher and is enabled by default. To request instance-level information from datastores not currently listed, get support at support.newrelic.com. In order to automatically instrument the performance of .NET Framework application calls to these datastores, make sure you have the .NET agent version 8.14 or higher: Datastore Instance details Other notes Couchbase SDK version 2.x.x (2.4.0 or higher is not supported). With Couchbase, the following are not instrumented by default in favor of their multi-document counterparts: Get(string key) GetDocument(string key) Remove(string key) Remove(string key, ulong cas) Upsert<T>(string key, T value) IBM DB2 Microsoft SQL Server MongoDB We support both the modern and legacy MongoDB drivers. Legacy - mongocsharpdriver Driver versions 1.10.0 or earlier: Instance details are not available in these driver versions. Modern - MongoDB.Driver Driver version 2.3.x, 2.4.x, 2.5.x, or 2.6.x Driver version 2.7.x: The .NET agent does not support API methods introduced by driver version 2.7.x, but does support pre-existing methods from previous versions. MySQL Use MySql.Data version 6.10.4 or later, or use the MySQL Connector Oracle PostgreSQL Use Npgsql 4.0. Prior versions of Npgsql may also be instrumented, but duplicate and/or missing metrics are possible. ServiceStack.Redis StackExchange.Redis Messaging The agent automatically instruments these message systems: MSMQ: Puts and takes on messages NServiceBus 5.0 (6.0 or higher not supported): Puts and takes on messages and cross application tracing RabbitMQ 3.5 or higher: Puts and takes on messages and queue purge. When receiving messages using an IBasicConsumer, the EventingBasicConsumer is the only implementation that is instrumented by the .NET agent. BasicGet is instrumented, but the agent does not support distributed tracing for BasicGet. The following methods are instrumented: IModel.BasicGet IModel.BasicPublish IModel.BasicComsume IModel.QueuePurge EventingBasicConsumer.HandleBasicDeliver CMS The agent automatically instruments the EPiServer content management system. External call libraries The agent automatically instruments these external call libraries : Libraries Supported methods HttpClient The agent instruments these HttpClient methods: SendAsync GetAsync PostAsync PutAsync DeleteAsync GetStringAsync GetStreamAsync GetByteArrayAsync RestSharp The agent instruments these RestSharp methods: ExecuteTaskAsync ExecuteGetTaskAsync ExecutePostTaskAsync Execute ExecuteAsGet ExecuteAsPost DownloadData HttpWebRequest The agent instruments these HttpWebRequest methods: GetResponse Connect the agent to other New Relic products In addition to APM, the agent integrates with other New Relic products to give you end-to-end visibility: Product Integration Browser monitoring For ASP.NET applications, the .NET agent automatically injects the browser JavaScript agent when you enable auto-instrumentation. After enabling browser injection, you can view browser data in the APM Summary page and quickly switch between the APM and browser data for a particular app. For configuration options and manual instrumentation, see Browser monitoring and the .NET agent. Automatic browser injection is not supported for ASP.NET core applications. Infrastructure monitoring When you install the Infrastructure and APM agents on the same host, they automatically detect one another. You can then view a list of hosts in the APM UI, and filter your Infrastructure hosts by APM app in the Infrastructure UI. For more information, see APM data in Infrastructure. Dashboards The .NET agent sends default events and attributes for NRQL queries. You can also record custom events for advanced analysis. Synthetic monitoring Synthetic transaction traces connect requests from Synthetics monitors to the underlying APM transaction.",

      "body": "New Relic's .NET agent supports both .NET Framework and .NET Core. This document describes compatibility and support for .NET Core applications. See Compatibility and requirements for .NET Framework for .NET Framework applications. New Relic's .NET agent includes built-in instrumentation for some of the most popular parts of the .NET Core ecosystem, including frameworks, databases, and message queuing systems. After installation, the agent runs within the monitored process; there is not a separate process or service created by the agent. For frameworks and libraries that are not automatically instrumented out of the box, you can extend the agent with .NET custom instrumentation. Want to try out our .NET agent? Create a New Relic account for free! No credit card required. Requirements Before you install the New Relic .NET agent on Windows or Linux, make sure your system meets these requirements: Microsoft .NET Core version The .NET agent supports .NET Core versions 2.0, 2.1, 2.2, 3.0, 3.1, and .NET 5.0. Table of minimum agent versions required per .NET Core version .NET Core Version Minimum Required .NET Agent Version .NET Core 2.0 > = 8.19.353.0 .NET Core 2.1 > = 8.19.353.0 .NET Core 2.2 > = 8.19.353.0 .NET Core 3.0 > = 8.21.34.0 .NET Core 3.1 > = 8.21.34.0 .NET 5.0 > = 8.35.0 The agent is not compatible with .NET Core versions 1.0 or 1.1. For .NET Core 2.1 or higher applications with tiered compilation enabled, the agent will disable tiered compilation. .NET Core 2.1 support requires .NET Core runtime 2.1.3 and .NET Core SDK 2.1.401 or higher due to a bug in the .NET Core profiling API. Target framework version The .NET agent only supports applications targeting .NET Core 2.0, 2.1, 2.2, 3.0, 3.1, and NET 5.0. You can find the target framework in your .csproj file: Supported: <TargetFramework>netcoreapp2.0</TargetFramework> Copy <TargetFramework>netcoreapp2.1</TargetFramework> Copy <TargetFramework>netcoreapp2.2</TargetFramework> Copy <TargetFramework>netcoreapp3.0</TargetFramework> Copy <TargetFramework>netcoreapp3.1</TargetFramework> Copy <TargetFramework>net5.0</TargetFramework> Copy Unsupported: <TargetFramework>net452</TargetFramework> Copy Important If you want to monitor an ASP.NET Core application targeting .NET Framework, ensure your install of the .NET agent has .NET Framework support enabled. App/web servers Ensure you use one of these app/web servers: Kestrel Kestrel with IIS reverse proxy via AspNetCoreModule Kestrel with IIS reverse proxy via AspNetCoreModuleV2 Kestrel with Nginx reverse proxy Kestrel with Apache reverse proxy Operating system The agent has been verified to work with the following operating systems: Operating system Supported versions Windows (32- and 64-bit Intel compatible architectures) Server 2008 R2 SP1 Server 2012 Server 2012 R2 Server 2016 Server 2019 Windows containers running on Server 2016 (NanoServer based images are not supported) Linux (64-bit Intel compatible only) All x64 Linux distributions supported by the .NET Core 2.0+/.NET 5 runtime are supported by the .NET agent. For a full list, refer to Microsoft's documentation for the version of the runtime you are using. Microsoft Azure For Azure-specific installation instructions, see: Install on Azure Cloud Services Install on Azure Service Fabric Install on Azure Web Apps Processor architectures The agent is available in both 32-bit (x86) and 64-bit (x64) versions on Windows as well as 64-bit (x64) on Linux. Permissions Installing and running the .NET agent requires these permissions: Component Necessary permissions Install the agent The process or user that installs the agent must have sufficient permissions to set environment variables and write access to the directory where the agent is installed. Run the agent The monitored process must have read/write access to the directory in which you installed the agent. The agent runs as a part of the monitored process and relies on those permissions to function. For applications using IIS via reverse proxy, the group IIS_IUSRS is often used. Security requirements As a standard security measure for data collection, your app server must support SHA-2 (256-bit). SHA-1 is not supported. Network requirements The agent requires your firewall to allow outgoing connections to specific networks and ports. Automatic instrumentation If your application is hosted in ASP.NET Core, the agent automatically creates and instruments transactions. The .NET agent will automatically instrument your application after install. If your app is not automatically instrumented, or if you want to add instrumentation, use custom instrumentation. App frameworks The .NET agent automatically instruments these application frameworks: ASP.NET Core MVC 2.0, 2.1, 2.2, 3.0, 3.1, and 5.0 (includes Web API) Datastores The .NET agent automatically instruments the performance of .NET application calls to these datastores: Datastore Instance details Notes Microsoft SQL Server Use System.Data.SqlClient version 4.3.1 or Microsoft.Data.SqlClient. PostgresSQL Use Npgsql 4.0. Prior versions of Npgsql may also be instrumented, but duplicate and/or missing metrics are possible. MongoDB Use driver version 2.3.x, 2.4.x, 2.5.x, or 2.6.x. Driver version 2.7.x: The .NET agent does not support API methods introduced by driver version 2.7.x, but does support pre-existing methods from previous versions. MySQL Use MySql.Data version 6.10.4 or later, or use the MySQL Connector StackExchange.Redis The .NET agent does not directly monitor datastore processes. Also, the .NET SQL parameter capture in a query trace does not list parameters for a parameterized query or a stored procedure. Collecting instance details for supported datastores is enabled by default. To request instance-level information from datastores not currently listed, get support at support.newrelic.com. External call libraries The .NET agent automatically instruments these external call libraries : Libraries Supported methods HttpClient The agent instruments these HttpClient methods: SendAsync GetAsync PostAsync PutAsync DeleteAsync GetStringAsync GetStreamAsync GetByteArrayAsync Messaging The agent automatically instruments these message systems: RabbitMQ 5.1.0 or higher: Puts and takes on messages and queue purge. When receiving messages using an IBasicConsumer, the EventingBasicConsumer is the only implementation that is instrumented by the .NET agent. BasicGet is instrumented, but the agent does not support distributed tracing for BasicGet. The following methods are instrumented: IModel.BasicGet IModel.BasicPublish IModel.BasicComsume IModel.QueuePurge EventingBasicConsumer.HandleBasicDeliver Unavailable features The following features are not available for the .NET agent: Memory usage on Linux due to an ongoing .NET Core issue (try using .NET performance metrics to get this information) Automatic brower monitoring script injection (API or manual instrumentation is required) The .NET agent does not support trim self-contained deployments and executables, because the compiler can potentially trim assemblies that the agent depends on. Infinite Tracing is not supported on Alpine Linux due to a GRPC compatibility issue. See this agent issue for more information. Connect the agent to other New Relic products In addition to APM, the .NET agent integrates with other New Relic products to give you end-to-end visibility: Product Integration Browser monitoring The browser monitoring JavaScript agent will not be injected by the .NET agent for ASP.NET core applications. However, you can inject the browser agent by using the .NET agent API or the browser agent's copy/paste method. After enabling browser injection, you can view browser data in the APM Summary page and quickly switch between the APM and browser data for a particular app. For configuration options and manual instrumentation, see browser monitoring and the .NET agent. Infrastructure monitoring When you install the Infrastructure and APM agents on the same host, they automatically detect one another.

      "body": "Deploying an app can be a risky event—when your app breaks, a bad deployment is often the cause. New Relic allows you to track deployments so you can correlate deploy to your app's performance. Tracking deployments creates deployment markers that appear in APM charts. Options for tracking deployments You can use the New Relic REST API v2 to record new deployments, retrieve a list of past deployments, and delete past deployments on your APM application. In addition, some APM agents have agent-specific methods to record deployments automatically. You can use your Slack integration with New Relic, or a simple webhook, to notify your team in real time of deployments for applications monitored by APM. Slack provides a webhook URL that allows you to post generic JSON that will appear formatted in a chosen Slack channel. There are a few places where you can view deployments in the New Relic UI after they have been recorded. You can view deployments in the UI: In the activity feed of the APM Summary, New Relic One Service summary, and entity summary pages. On APM performance charts as a chart marker. On the Deployments page for summary performance. Tip Deployment markers are not available for browser applications, but see browser releases for a way to tag errors with release versions. Record deployments with the REST API You can use the New Relic REST API v2 to record deployments, get a list of past deployments, and delete deployments. The examples in this document use curl as a command line tool. However, you can use any method to make your REST requests. You can also create, view, and delete deployments with the API Explorer. JSON uses double quotes \" for element names and content. Using single quotes ' will cause errors. Record a deployment with POST To record a new deployment, send a POST request that includes your API key to the deployments endpoint. Attach the payload in JSON format (see Character limits and JSON parameters). All payload parameters are optional except revision. For example: curl -X POST \"https://api.newrelic.com/v2/applications/$APP_ID/deployments.json\" \\ -H \"Api-Key:$API_KEY\" \\ -i \\ -H \"Content-Type: application/json\" \\ -d \\ '{ \"deployment\": { \"revision\": \"REVISION\", \"changelog\": \"Added: /v2/deployments.rb, Removed: None\", \"description\": \"Added a deployments resource to the v2 API\", \"user\": \"datanerd@example.com\", \"timestamp\": \"2019-10-08T00:15:36Z\" } }' Copy Record a deployment with PowerShell To record a deployment with PowerShell, send a POST request that includes your API key to the deployments endpoint. Attach the payload in JSON format (see Character limits and JSON parameters). All payload parameters are optional except revision. This example uses PowerShell version 3 or higher: Invoke-WebRequest -Uri https://api.newrelic.com/v2/applications/YOUR_APP_ID/deployments.json -Method POST -Headers @{'Api-Key'='$API_KEY'} -ContentType 'application/json' -Body '{ \"deployment\": { \"revision\": \"REVISION\", \"changelog\": \"Added: /v2/deployments.rb, Removed: None\", \"description\": \"Added a deployments resource to the v2 API\", \"user\": \"datanerd@example.com\", \"timestamp\": \"2019-10-08T00:15:36Z\" } }' Copy This example uses PowerShell version 2 (requires .NET framework 3.5 or higher): $encoding = [System.Text.Encoding]::GetEncoding(\"ASCII\") $data ='{ \"deployment\": { \"revision\": \"REVISION\", \"changelog\": \"Added: /v2/deployments.rb, Removed: None\", \"description\": \"Added a deployments resource to the v2 API\", \"user\": \"datanerd@example.com\", \"timestamp\": \"2019-10-08T00:15:36Z\" } }' $postData = $encoding.GetBytes($data) $request = [System.Net.WebRequest]::Create('https://api.newrelic.com/v2/applications/$APP_ID/deployments.json') $request.Method = 'POST' $request.Headers.add('Api-Key','$API_KEY') $request.ContentType='application/json' $stream = $request.GetRequestStream() $stream.Write($postData,0,$postData.Length) $request.GetResponse() Copy View a list of deployments with GET To retrieve a list of all past deployments for your app, send a GET request that includes your API key to the deployments endpoint. GET requests do not use a JSON payload. For example: curl -X GET \"https://api.newrelic.com/v2/applications/$APP_ID/deployments.json\" \\ -H \"Api-Key:$API_KEY\" \\ -i Copy Sample output from GET This example requests a list of deployments for app ID 9999999: curl -X GET \"https://api.newrelic.com/v2/applications/9999999/deployments.json\" \\ -H \"Api-Key:ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXabcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwx\" \\ -i Copy The API returns this list of deployments: HTTP/1.1 200 OK ETag: \"ABCDEFGHIJKabcdefghijk0123456789\" Cache-Control: max-age=0, private, must-revalidate Content-Type: application/json { \"deployments\": [ { \"id\": 1234567, \"revision\": \"1234123412341234123412341234123412341234\", \"changelog\": \"Fixed the bugs for real this time\", \"description\": \"Example description two\", \"user\": \"Data Nerd\", \"timestamp\": \"2016-02-24T10:09:27-08:00\", \"links\": { \"application\": 9999999 } }, { \"id\": 2345678, \"revision\": \"7890789078907890789078907890789078907890\", \"changelog\": \"Think I fixed all the bugs\", \"description\": null, \"user\": \"Dren Atad\", \"timestamp\": \"2014-10-22T12:23:47-07:00\", \"links\": { \"application\": 9999999 } } ], \"links\": { \"deployment.agent\": \"/v2/applications/{application_id}\" } } Copy Delete a deployment with DELETE To delete a deployment, send a DELETE request that includes your API key to the deployments endpoint. DELETE requests do not use a JSON payload, but you must specify the ID for the deployment you want to delete. To retrieve the ID for a deployment, use the GET request. For example: curl -X DELETE \"https://api.newrelic.com/v2/applications/$APP_ID/deployments/$DEPLOYMENT_ID.json\" \\ -H \"Api-Key:$API_KEY\" \\ -i Copy Character limits and JSON parameters The JSON payload can include the following parameters. Important UTF-8 4 byte characters, such as Emojis and some non-Latin language glyphs, cannot be used in the deployment text. Parameter Data type Description revision String, 127 character maximum Required. A unique ID for this deployment, visible in the Summary page and on the Deployments page. Can be any string, but is usually a version number or a Git checksum. changelog String, 65535 character maximum Optional. A summary of what changed in this deployment, visible in the Deployments page when you select (selected deployment) > Change log. description String, 65535 character maximum Optional. A high-level description of this deployment, visible in the Summary page and on the Deployments page when you select an individual deployment. user String, 31 character maximum Optional. A username to associate with the deployment, visible in the Summary page and on the Deployments page. timestamp ISO 8601 Optional. When the deployment occurred, down to the second. If not specified, the deployment will be recorded at the time when the API call was received. Timestamp requirements: Must be in UTC time. Must be after the most recent deployment timestamp. Cannot be in the future. Must be in ISO8601 format; for example, \"2019-10-08T00:15:36Z\". Record deployments using the New Relic agent Some agents have additional methods to record deployments: All agents: Use the New Relic REST API v2. C: No SDK-specific methods. Use the REST API. Go: No agent-specific methods. Use the REST API. Java: Call the Java agent jar. .NET: Use PowerShell and the REST API. Node.js: No agent-specific methods. Use the REST API. PHP: Use a PHP script. Python: Use the record-deploy subcommand of the newrelic-admin script. Ruby: Use a Capistrano recipe. Notify your team of deployments After a deployment is recorded using the REST API, you can optionally notify a webhook endpoint of the deployment. The destination of the webhook can be your Slack instance. To use webhooks to set up a deployment notification for a Slack channel: Log in to your Slack account as an admin, then go to App directory > Manage > Apps. Search for your New Relic app, then select Add configuration. From Post to channel, select an existing Slack channel or add a new channel, then Add configuration. From the list of options, copy the webhook URL. Go to one.newrelic.com > (account dropdown) > Account settings > Integrations > Deploy notifications > Webhook. Paste the Slack webhook URL, then save. Optional: Send a test message. Tip You can also use webhooks, Slack channels, and other options for alert notifications with New Relic Alerts. End of life notification: Hipchat, Campfire As of September 9, 2019, integrations with Hipchat and Campfire for APM deployment notifications will no longer be available. Recommendation: If you are still using Hipchat or Campfire, use webhooks with Slack channels instead. For more information, see the New Relic Explorers Hub post.",

      "body": "Applications are automatically removed from New Relic after 93 days without sending data to our platform. You can also remove an application using the UI, once it has stopped sending data. Key metrics will continue to be available via the New Relic REST API, with the application name remaining reserved. For more information, see Inactive apps in New Relic One and our data retention guidelines. Before attempting to remove an app Before attempting to remove an APM, browser, or mobile app from the New Relic UI, keep in mind: You can downgrade your account to pay less or make it entirely free. To remove an app, you must have a user role with that capability. If an agent is still sending data from an app, you cannot remove an app. Remove an application from New Relic Before removing an APM, browser, or mobile application from New Relic, stop the application from sending data either by disabling the agent or by uninstalling it completely. APM applications Disable the APM agent: C SDK: Do a quick recompile and deploy. For example, surround your instrumentation in #ifdef, and set the value of YOURNAMESPACE_NEWRELIC_ENABLED with your build system. Go: Set Enabled to false. Java: Set agent_enabled to false. .NET: Set Newrelic.AgentEnabled to false. Node.js: Set agent_enabled to false. PHP: Remove or disable both the newrelic.so and newrelic-daemon components. Set newrelic.enabled to false. Python: Set monitor_mode to false. Ruby: Set agent_enabled to false. Restart the application server and wait up to ten minutes. Verify the color-coded health status for the app has turned to gray and is no longer reporting data. To remove the APM application and any browser applications linked to it, you have two options: Click the Delete application button on the APM application/service's Settings page. Go to one.newrelic.com > APM > (select an app/service) > Settings > Application. Or, call the /applications/delete endpoint of the New Relic REST API. For example: curl -X DELETE 'https://api.newrelic.com/v2/applications/YOUR_APP_ID.json' \\ -H 'X-Api-Key:YOUR_API_KEY' -i Copy Browser If you've used the copy/paste method to install the browser agent, remove the JavaScript snippet from your application's pages. After 93 days, the application will be removed from New Relic. Tip If browser data continues to be reported, see our suggestions below. Once your browser application has stopped reporting, you have two ways to remove it: If your browser application is linked to an APM application, deleting the APM application also removes the browser application. See the instructions for deleting an APM application/service above for details. Or, click the Delete application button on the browser application's Application settings page. Go to one.newrelic.com > Browser > (select an app) > Settings > Application settings . Mobile Remove all references/dependencies to the New Relic's mobile SDK/frameworks, then rebuild the application. For more information, see the iOS and Android install docs. After 93 days, the application will be removed from New Relic. Or, once your mobile application has stopped reporting, you can also remove it manually: Click the Delete application button on the mobile application's Settings page. Go to one.newrelic.com > Mobile > (select an app) > Settings > Application . Troubleshooting If you have problems removing an app, here are some possible causes and suggested solutions: You are not an admin on your full user account If you don't have proper permissions, you won't be able to remove an application. You have not waited long enough All app data must stop reporting to New Relic before you can remove that entity from New Relic. In most cases, this takes between 10-15 minutes. In rare cases, it can take a few minutes longer. Not all agents are disabled If you have multiple agents reporting data under the same UI name, then you must make sure you disable or uninstall all of the agents associated with that entity. You have problems removing your PHP app If you have a PHP app and aren't able to remove it from the UI, possible causes include: You have not disabled both components of the PHP agent. You must stop or uninstall both newrelic.so and newrelic-daemon in order to be able to remove a PHP app. For more information, see New Relic daemon processes. You have set up per-directory monitoring of your PHP app, and unexpected PHP data is reporting as the default PHP application in the New Relic UI. To fix this, change the default app name in the PHP agent config. You don't know where the app's data is coming from If you don't know where an app's data is coming from, it may be because the app's name has been changed. When an app name is changed in the UI, it does not change the underlying app name being reported; it only changes how the app name appears in the UI. To see if there is a difference between the reported name and the displayed name: From one.newrelic.com, select APM, then select an application. Scroll down to Settings and select Application. Compare the name in the Application alias field to the name in the Your application still reports as message directly beneath it. To get host information about an app you are not familiar with: From one.newrelic.com, select APM, then select an application. From the summary view, review the Servers list. Once you have identified where app data is coming from, you can remove the app from New Relic. Browser data is still reporting To remove an app from New Relic, all data must have stopped reporting, including browser monitoring data. To verify that you have disabled or uninstalled the APM agent associated with the app: Ensure that browser monitoring is disabled. If your browser monitoring script is inserted by the APM agent, turn it off from inside the UI, in the agent's config file, or in both. If you copied and pasted the monitoring JavaScript snippet in certain pages, remove that JavaScript snippet manually. Ensure all caches have been cleared that the application uses, such as host caches, CDNs, or anything else that caches built pages. Optional: To see a count of how many page views report from each domain, use this NRQL query: SELECT count(*) FROM PageView WHERE appName = 'YOUR_BROWSER_APP_NAME' FACET domain Copy If these steps don't resolve the issue, it is likely due to an end-user's browser cache that hasn't yet cleared. Wait until those caches clear. If your app has internal users, you may be able to identify the users and clear those caches. For more help",

Related procedures: To permanently disable APM, uninstall the agent. To configure an agent to monitor some things but not others, use custom instrumentation. Disable the APM agent Select your agent type for instructions: C SDK The C SDK cannot be turned on or off directly. However, you can write your code for the SDK so that a quick recompile and deploy can enable or disable your instrumentation. Follow standard procedures to disable or uninstall the C SDK. Go There are two main ways to disable the Go agent: Remove the import of the github.com/newrelic/go-agent package from your application, and remove or comment out any calls to the newrelic namespace. Then, recompile and restart your app. Use the enabled configuration setting. Then, recompile and restart your app. (This will not reduce overhead because the instrumentation is still running; it will only prevent the sending of data to the New Relic collector.) Tip After you disable the agent, it may take several minutes for data to stop showing up. Java There are three main ways to disable the Java agent: Set agent_enabled to false, then restart the JVM. Use the JVM command line flag: -Dnewrelic.config.agent_enabled=false Copy Then restart the JVM. Remove the newrelic.jar or newrelic.yml file, then restart the JVM. Tip After you disable the agent, it may take several minutes for data to stop showing up. .NET The method to disable the agent depends on if you are using Framework or Core: .NET Framework: Set agentEnabled to false in the global newrelic.config file, found in C:\\ProgramData\\New Relic\\.NET Agent\\. If the application is IIS-hosted, restart IIS. If it's self-hosted (non-IIS), restart the application. .NET Core: Set agentEnabled to false in the newrelic.config file found in the Core agent’s installation directory (for Windows alongside NewRelic.Profiler.dll and for Linux alongside NewRelic.Profiler.so). If you use the ASP.NET Core Module, reset IIS. Otherwise, restart your Core application. Tip After you disable the agent, it may take several minutes for data to stop showing up. Node.js There are two main ways to disable the Node.js agent: Set agent_enabled to false in your agent config file, then restart the app server. Set the NEW_RELIC_ENABLED environment variable to false. Tip After you disable the agent, it may take several minutes for data to stop showing up. PHP To disable the PHP agent, set the enabled config setting to false, then restart the web server or PHP. Tip After you disable the agent, it may take several minutes for data to stop showing up. Python There are three main ways to disable the Python agent, depending on your preference and setup: Standard install: Use the monitor_mode configuration setting. This can be done by editing the config file or by using an environment variable. Standard install with newrelic-admin script: Remove reference to that script in your application. Manual instrumentation: Remove the initialization script from your application. Tip After you disable the agent, it may take several minutes for data to stop showing up. Ruby There are several ways to disable the Ruby agent, depending on your preference and setup. These methods will remove most instrumentation but there will still be a small amount of activity and overhead: Use the agent_enabled configuration setting. This can be done in the configuration file or in the per-environment stanzas. Restart your app server afterward. Do the same via an environment variable, then restart the app server. The following methods will remove all instrumentation and overhead: Remove newrelic_rpm from the Gemfile and bundle install. Set the following in the Gemfile and bundle install: gem 'newrelic_rpm', :require => false Copy This option ensures the gem is installed if it's required somewhere in the app, but doesn't install it when bundling.

      "body": "Deploying an app can be a risky event—when your app breaks, a bad deployment is often the cause. New Relic allows you to track deployments so you can correlate deploy to your app's performance. Tracking deployments creates deployment markers that appear in APM charts. Options for tracking deployments You can use the New Relic REST API v2 to record new deployments, retrieve a list of past deployments, and delete past deployments on your APM application. In addition, some APM agents have agent-specific methods to record deployments automatically. You can use your Slack integration with New Relic, or a simple webhook, to notify your team in real time of deployments for applications monitored by APM. Slack provides a webhook URL that allows you to post generic JSON that will appear formatted in a chosen Slack channel. There are a few places where you can view deployments in the New Relic UI after they have been recorded. You can view deployments in the UI: In the activity feed of the APM Summary, New Relic One Service summary, and entity summary pages. On APM performance charts as a chart marker. On the Deployments page for summary performance. Tip Deployment markers are not available for browser applications, but see browser releases for a way to tag errors with release versions. Record deployments with the REST API You can use the New Relic REST API v2 to record deployments, get a list of past deployments, and delete deployments. The examples in this document use curl as a command line tool. However, you can use any method to make your REST requests. You can also create, view, and delete deployments with the API Explorer. JSON uses double quotes \" for element names and content. Using single quotes ' will cause errors. Record a deployment with POST To record a new deployment, send a POST request that includes your API key to the deployments endpoint. Attach the payload in JSON format (see Character limits and JSON parameters). All payload parameters are optional except revision. For example: curl -X POST \"https://api.newrelic.com/v2/applications/$APP_ID/deployments.json\" \\ -H \"Api-Key:$API_KEY\" \\ -i \\ -H \"Content-Type: application/json\" \\ -d \\ '{ \"deployment\": { \"revision\": \"REVISION\", \"changelog\": \"Added: /v2/deployments.rb, Removed: None\", \"description\": \"Added a deployments resource to the v2 API\", \"user\": \"datanerd@example.com\", \"timestamp\": \"2019-10-08T00:15:36Z\" } }' Copy Record a deployment with PowerShell To record a deployment with PowerShell, send a POST request that includes your API key to the deployments endpoint. Attach the payload in JSON format (see Character limits and JSON parameters). All payload parameters are optional except revision. This example uses PowerShell version 3 or higher: Invoke-WebRequest -Uri https://api.newrelic.com/v2/applications/YOUR_APP_ID/deployments.json -Method POST -Headers @{'Api-Key'='$API_KEY'} -ContentType 'application/json' -Body '{ \"deployment\": { \"revision\": \"REVISION\", \"changelog\": \"Added: /v2/deployments.rb, Removed: None\", \"description\": \"Added a deployments resource to the v2 API\", \"user\": \"datanerd@example.com\", \"timestamp\": \"2019-10-08T00:15:36Z\" } }' Copy This example uses PowerShell version 2 (requires .NET framework 3.5 or higher): $encoding = [System.Text.Encoding]::GetEncoding(\"ASCII\") $data ='{ \"deployment\": { \"revision\": \"REVISION\", \"changelog\": \"Added: /v2/deployments.rb, Removed: None\", \"description\": \"Added a deployments resource to the v2 API\", \"user\": \"datanerd@example.com\", \"timestamp\": \"2019-10-08T00:15:36Z\" } }' $postData = $encoding.GetBytes($data) $request = [System.Net.WebRequest]::Create('https://api.newrelic.com/v2/applications/$APP_ID/deployments.json') $request.Method = 'POST' $request.Headers.add('Api-Key','$API_KEY') $request.ContentType='application/json' $stream = $request.GetRequestStream() $stream.Write($postData,0,$postData.Length) $request.GetResponse() Copy View a list of deployments with GET To retrieve a list of all past deployments for your app, send a GET request that includes your API key to the deployments endpoint. GET requests do not use a JSON payload. For example: curl -X GET \"https://api.newrelic.com/v2/applications/$APP_ID/deployments.json\" \\ -H \"Api-Key:$API_KEY\" \\ -i Copy Sample output from GET This example requests a list of deployments for app ID 9999999: curl -X GET \"https://api.newrelic.com/v2/applications/9999999/deployments.json\" \\ -H \"Api-Key:ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXabcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwx\" \\ -i Copy The API returns this list of deployments: HTTP/1.1 200 OK ETag: \"ABCDEFGHIJKabcdefghijk0123456789\" Cache-Control: max-age=0, private, must-revalidate Content-Type: application/json { \"deployments\": [ { \"id\": 1234567, \"revision\": \"1234123412341234123412341234123412341234\", \"changelog\": \"Fixed the bugs for real this time\", \"description\": \"Example description two\", \"user\": \"Data Nerd\", \"timestamp\": \"2016-02-24T10:09:27-08:00\", \"links\": { \"application\": 9999999 } }, { \"id\": 2345678, \"revision\": \"7890789078907890789078907890789078907890\", \"changelog\": \"Think I fixed all the bugs\", \"description\": null, \"user\": \"Dren Atad\", \"timestamp\": \"2014-10-22T12:23:47-07:00\", \"links\": { \"application\": 9999999 } } ], \"links\": { \"deployment.agent\": \"/v2/applications/{application_id}\" } } Copy Delete a deployment with DELETE To delete a deployment, send a DELETE request that includes your API key to the deployments endpoint. DELETE requests do not use a JSON payload, but you must specify the ID for the deployment you want to delete. To retrieve the ID for a deployment, use the GET request. For example: curl -X DELETE \"https://api.newrelic.com/v2/applications/$APP_ID/deployments/$DEPLOYMENT_ID.json\" \\ -H \"Api-Key:$API_KEY\" \\ -i Copy Character limits and JSON parameters The JSON payload can include the following parameters. Important UTF-8 4 byte characters, such as Emojis and some non-Latin language glyphs, cannot be used in the deployment text. Parameter Data type Description revision String, 127 character maximum Required. A unique ID for this deployment, visible in the Summary page and on the Deployments page. Can be any string, but is usually a version number or a Git checksum. changelog String, 65535 character maximum Optional. A summary of what changed in this deployment, visible in the Deployments page when you select (selected deployment) > Change log. description String, 65535 character maximum Optional. A high-level description of this deployment, visible in the Summary page and on the Deployments page when you select an individual deployment. user String, 31 character maximum Optional. A username to associate with the deployment, visible in the Summary page and on the Deployments page. timestamp ISO 8601 Optional. When the deployment occurred, down to the second. If not specified, the deployment will be recorded at the time when the API call was received. Timestamp requirements: Must be in UTC time. Must be after the most recent deployment timestamp. Cannot be in the future. Must be in ISO8601 format; for example, \"2019-10-08T00:15:36Z\". Record deployments using the New Relic agent Some agents have additional methods to record deployments: All agents: Use the New Relic REST API v2. C: No SDK-specific methods. Use the REST API. Go: No agent-specific methods. Use the REST API. Java: Call the Java agent jar. .NET: Use PowerShell and the REST API. Node.js: No agent-specific methods. Use the REST API. PHP: Use a PHP script. Python: Use the record-deploy subcommand of the newrelic-admin script. Ruby: Use a Capistrano recipe. Notify your team of deployments After a deployment is recorded using the REST API, you can optionally notify a webhook endpoint of the deployment. The destination of the webhook can be your Slack instance. To use webhooks to set up a deployment notification for a Slack channel: Log in to your Slack account as an admin, then go to App directory > Manage > Apps. Search for your New Relic app, then select Add configuration. From Post to channel, select an existing Slack channel or add a new channel, then Add configuration. From the list of options, copy the webhook URL. Go to one.newrelic.com > (account dropdown) > Account settings > Integrations > Deploy notifications > Webhook. Paste the Slack webhook URL, then save. Optional: Send a test message. Tip You can also use webhooks, Slack channels, and other options for alert notifications with New Relic Alerts. End of life notification: Hipchat, Campfire As of September 9, 2019, integrations with Hipchat and Campfire for APM deployment notifications will no longer be available. Recommendation: If you are still using Hipchat or Campfire, use webhooks with Slack channels instead. For more information, see the New Relic Explorers Hub post.",

Related procedures: To permanently disable APM, uninstall the agent. To configure an agent to monitor some things but not others, use custom instrumentation. Disable the APM agent Select your agent type for instructions: C SDK The C SDK cannot be turned on or off directly. However, you can write your code for the SDK so that a quick recompile and deploy can enable or disable your instrumentation. Follow standard procedures to disable or uninstall the C SDK. Go There are two main ways to disable the Go agent: Remove the import of the github.com/newrelic/go-agent package from your application, and remove or comment out any calls to the newrelic namespace. Then, recompile and restart your app. Use the enabled configuration setting. Then, recompile and restart your app. (This will not reduce overhead because the instrumentation is still running; it will only prevent the sending of data to the New Relic collector.) Tip After you disable the agent, it may take several minutes for data to stop showing up. Java There are three main ways to disable the Java agent: Set agent_enabled to false, then restart the JVM. Use the JVM command line flag: -Dnewrelic.config.agent_enabled=false Copy Then restart the JVM. Remove the newrelic.jar or newrelic.yml file, then restart the JVM. Tip After you disable the agent, it may take several minutes for data to stop showing up. .NET The method to disable the agent depends on if you are using Framework or Core: .NET Framework: Set agentEnabled to false in the global newrelic.config file, found in C:\\ProgramData\\New Relic\\.NET Agent\\. If the application is IIS-hosted, restart IIS. If it's self-hosted (non-IIS), restart the application. .NET Core: Set agentEnabled to false in the newrelic.config file found in the Core agent’s installation directory (for Windows alongside NewRelic.Profiler.dll and for Linux alongside NewRelic.Profiler.so). If you use the ASP.NET Core Module, reset IIS. Otherwise, restart your Core application. Tip After you disable the agent, it may take several minutes for data to stop showing up. Node.js There are two main ways to disable the Node.js agent: Set agent_enabled to false in your agent config file, then restart the app server. Set the NEW_RELIC_ENABLED environment variable to false. Tip After you disable the agent, it may take several minutes for data to stop showing up. PHP To disable the PHP agent, set the enabled config setting to false, then restart the web server or PHP. Tip After you disable the agent, it may take several minutes for data to stop showing up. Python There are three main ways to disable the Python agent, depending on your preference and setup: Standard install: Use the monitor_mode configuration setting. This can be done by editing the config file or by using an environment variable. Standard install with newrelic-admin script: Remove reference to that script in your application. Manual instrumentation: Remove the initialization script from your application. Tip After you disable the agent, it may take several minutes for data to stop showing up. Ruby There are several ways to disable the Ruby agent, depending on your preference and setup. These methods will remove most instrumentation but there will still be a small amount of activity and overhead: Use the agent_enabled configuration setting. This can be done in the configuration file or in the per-environment stanzas. Restart your app server afterward. Do the same via an environment variable, then restart the app server. The following methods will remove all instrumentation and overhead: Remove newrelic_rpm from the Gemfile and bundle install. Set the following in the Gemfile and bundle install: gem 'newrelic_rpm', :require => false Copy This option ensures the gem is installed if it's required somewhere in the app, but doesn't install it when bundling.

      "body": "Problem CPU percent usage data between APM and infrastructure seems contradictory, or your CPU usage exceeds 100%. Cause CPU usage data for APM is different than CPU usage data for infrastructure. In APM, CPU percent usage measures aggregate usage of all instances of an application or service on a given server. In Infrastructure, CPU percent usage is measured differently depending on if you are viewing CPU usage in relation to hosts, or to processes. APM To view your app's CPU usage: Go to one.newrelic.com > (select an app) and see the CPU usage in the hosts list. The number of instances is listed under each host name (for example, 55 instances). APM CPU percent usage measures aggregate CPU usage of all instances of your app or service on a given server. This percentage is affected by the number of instances running across cores on the server. Multiple instances of a service running on one server or in a multi-core environment can produce CPU usage percentages well above 100%. APM calculates the percentage by aggregating CPU time and dividing by clock time: CPU usage = (instance CPU time + instance CPU time + [...]) / (clock time) Copy Example: Upgrading to a quad core processor If you upgrade from a dual processor to a quad processor under the same architecture, you should see roughly the same CPU numbers for the same loads and applications. If New Relic normalized the calculation, the upgrade would appear to produce an abrupt decrease in your CPU usage, even if the number of cycles you are using would be the same. Adding more instances does not make your code more efficient. New Relic Infrastructure To view your individual host CPU usage: Go to one.newrelic.com > Infrastructure and see CPU %. See individual CPU usage in the hosts list. The exact calculation for CPU usage is measured differently depending on if you are viewing CPU usage in relation to hosts, or to processes: Page Calculation details Hosts On the Hosts page, CPU Percent is a derived metric that is part of the SystemSample event. The CPU percentage is not collected by New Relic, but derived from several other metrics. Specifically, the cpuPercent attribute is an aggregation of cpuUserPercent, cpuSystemPercent, cpuIoWaitPercent and cpuStealPercent. The Hosts page shows metrics from a perspective of your whole system. For example, if a server has 32 cores installed and is showing cpuPercent of 50%, 16 of the 32 cores are being used. Processes On the Processes page, CPU percent is scoped to individual processes, rather than hosts. Because of this, the CPU percent metric does not take into account the resources of the entire system. Instead, it shows how much of a single CPU core each process is taking. For example, with a 32-core server, a process showing cpuPercent of 50% is only taking half of a single core, or about 1.5625% of the CPU cycles available on the whole server. This can result in cpuPercent exceeding 100% on the Processes page. When this occurs, the process is demanding more than a single core’s worth of CPU cycles.",

Cause CPU usage data for APM is different than CPU usage data for infrastructure. In APM, CPU percent usage measures aggregate usage of all instances of an application or service on a given server. In Infrastructure, CPU percent usage is measured differently depending on if you are viewing CPU usage in relation to hosts, or to processes. APM To view your app's CPU usage: Go to one.newrelic.com > (select an app) and see the CPU usage in the hosts list. The number of instances is listed under each host name (for example, 55 instances). APM CPU percent usage measures aggregate CPU usage of all instances of your app or service on a given server. This percentage is affected by the number of instances running across cores on the server. Multiple instances of a service running on one server or in a multi-core environment can produce CPU usage percentages well above 100%. APM calculates the percentage by aggregating CPU time and dividing by clock time: CPU usage = (instance CPU time + instance CPU time + [...]) / (clock time) Copy Example: Upgrading to a quad core processor If you upgrade from a dual processor to a quad processor under the same architecture, you should see roughly the same CPU numbers for the same loads and applications. If New Relic normalized the calculation, the upgrade would appear to produce an abrupt decrease in your CPU usage, even if the number of cycles you are using would be the same. Adding more instances does not make your code more efficient. New Relic Infrastructure To view your individual host CPU usage: Go to one.newrelic.com > Infrastructure and see CPU %. See individual CPU usage in the hosts list. The exact calculation for CPU usage is measured differently depending on if you are viewing CPU usage in relation to hosts, or to processes: Page Calculation details Hosts On the Hosts page, CPU Percent is a derived metric that is part of the SystemSample event. The CPU percentage is not collected by New Relic, but derived from several other metrics. Specifically, the cpuPercent attribute is an aggregation of cpuUserPercent, cpuSystemPercent, cpuIoWaitPercent and cpuStealPercent. The Hosts page shows metrics from a perspective of your whole system. For example, if a server has 32 cores installed and is showing cpuPercent of 50%, 16 of the 32 cores are being used. Processes On the Processes page, CPU percent is scoped to individual processes, rather than hosts. Because of this, the CPU percent metric does not take into account the resources of the entire system. Instead, it shows how much of a single CPU core each process is taking. For example, with a 32-core server, a process showing cpuPercent of 50% is only taking half of a single core, or about 1.5625% of the CPU cycles available on the whole server. This can result in cpuPercent exceeding 100% on the Processes page. When this occurs, the process is demanding more than a single core’s worth of CPU cycles.",

      "body": "This document explains what non-web transactions are in APM, and how you can instrument background tasks and other arbitrary activity to be reported as non-web transactions. What are non-web transactions? The two main APM transaction categories are web and non-web. Web transactions are transactions we detect as being initiated by a web request; they are the most common type of transaction reported by APM. Non-web transactions are transactions that are not web transactions; we do not detect they were initiated by a web request. This includes processes and jobs that do not handle web requests, such as message processing and background tasks. For example, you might schedule something to run periodically on your server to do database work, send emails, etc. The source is not a web request but something on your server. Some non-web transactions from supported frameworks or services are detected automatically by New Relic; others may be created using custom instrumentation. We intentionally separate your web and non-web transactions in the UI. Non-web vs. web transactions Comments Less directly important Non-web transactions are often background processes and tasks, and they are less directly important to your application's users when compared to web transactions. Long running Non-web transactions are often long-running processes. Separating them from web transactions prevents those results from skewing your customer-facing response times. Omitted from Apdex score Combining your non-web transactions with your web transactions would hurt your Apdex score (a measure of satisfaction with load times). This is why Apdex data for non-web transactions does not appear in the UI. Create non-web transactions To create new non-web transactions, follow the procedures for your APM language agent. C SDK Follow the procedures for instrumenting a non-web transaction. Go Follow the procedures for instrumenting a non-web transaction. Java Follow the procedures for instrumenting a transaction (instrumenting a transaction without web request parameters creates a non-web transaction). .NET By default, the APM .NET agent instruments IIS ASP workers. To instrument other (non-IIS) .NET applications, such as standalone (WCF) services, console apps, and other Windows services, see Instrumenting custom applications and Instrumenting WCF applications. Important For IIS applications, you cannot change web transactions to non-web transactions. Node.js Use startBackgroundTransaction(). PHP To mark a transaction as non-web: use newrelic_background_job and set the flag to true. The PHP agent reports all command-line run scripts as non-web transactions. Python See Python agent non-web transactions. The Python agent also supports non-web transaction reporting from Celery and Gearman. Ruby See Ruby agent non-web transactions. View non-web transactions To view non-web transaction data in the New Relic UI, go to the main chart on the following pages, and then select the Non-web option in the dropdown: New Relic Explorer: Go to one.newrelic.com > Explorer > (select an app) > Summary. APM: Go to one.newrelic.com > APM > (select an app) > Summary. Transactions: Go to one.newrelic.com > APM > (select an app) > Monitor > Transactions.",

SLA tips Comments Requirements When using the cURL command examples, be sure to replace the placeholder text with your account ID, an API key, and the application ID. Time ranges You are not limited to standard day, week, or month time ranges. For example, you can extract metric data for a \"holiday weekend\" from 12/23 to 12/26 or \"the 20 minutes after our site had problems\" or whatever other period interests you. UTC XML time format You must specify the time in UTC XML format, so be sure to adjust for your time zone compared to UTC. For example, New Relic starts at 16:00:00 on the day before the selected data, since New Relic headquarters are in UTC-8. Summary reports When requesting metrics to use with summary reports, include the query string parameter summarize=true (v2) or summary=1 (v1) as shown in the examples. Scaled statistics Your report has some statistics that are scaled in the SLA reports in New Relic's user interface. New Relic changes the scale of page views in your report to show small numbers. Depending on your traffic, typically it might be displayed in thousands, millions, or billions. Recommendation: To avoid a string of zeroes, divide this number appropriately for your own purposes. End user statistics End user statistics will reflect only the calls in which the agent gathered browser data. For example, end user stats may not appear in situations such as: Browser types Clients (they might have disabled the JavaScript agent, or blocked traffic to New Relic sites for JavaScript code's location Transactions not in one of those categories, in case the page load did not complete for any reason This is why there are fewer (sometimes many fewer) page views in the End User (browser) data section than in the App server data section. Examples The following sections contain code examples to acquire the data for values described above for the Daily (24hr) SLA statistics in the default GMT/UTC time zone. Adjust the from= and to= for your time range as desired. There are syntactical differences between New Relic's REST API v2 and v1. The examples show how to use each.

      "body": "This document explains what non-web transactions are in APM, and how you can instrument background tasks and other arbitrary activity to be reported as non-web transactions. What are non-web transactions? The two main APM transaction categories are web and non-web. Web transactions are transactions we detect as being initiated by a web request; they are the most common type of transaction reported by APM. Non-web transactions are transactions that are not web transactions; we do not detect they were initiated by a web request. This includes processes and jobs that do not handle web requests, such as message processing and background tasks. For example, you might schedule something to run periodically on your server to do database work, send emails, etc. The source is not a web request but something on your server. Some non-web transactions from supported frameworks or services are detected automatically by New Relic; others may be created using custom instrumentation. We intentionally separate your web and non-web transactions in the UI. Non-web vs. web transactions Comments Less directly important Non-web transactions are often background processes and tasks, and they are less directly important to your application's users when compared to web transactions. Long running Non-web transactions are often long-running processes. Separating them from web transactions prevents those results from skewing your customer-facing response times. Omitted from Apdex score Combining your non-web transactions with your web transactions would hurt your Apdex score (a measure of satisfaction with load times). This is why Apdex data for non-web transactions does not appear in the UI. Create non-web transactions To create new non-web transactions, follow the procedures for your APM language agent. C SDK Follow the procedures for instrumenting a non-web transaction. Go Follow the procedures for instrumenting a non-web transaction. Java Follow the procedures for instrumenting a transaction (instrumenting a transaction without web request parameters creates a non-web transaction). .NET By default, the APM .NET agent instruments IIS ASP workers. To instrument other (non-IIS) .NET applications, such as standalone (WCF) services, console apps, and other Windows services, see Instrumenting custom applications and Instrumenting WCF applications. Important For IIS applications, you cannot change web transactions to non-web transactions. Node.js Use startBackgroundTransaction(). PHP To mark a transaction as non-web: use newrelic_background_job and set the flag to true. The PHP agent reports all command-line run scripts as non-web transactions. Python See Python agent non-web transactions. The Python agent also supports non-web transaction reporting from Celery and Gearman. Ruby See Ruby agent non-web transactions. View non-web transactions To view non-web transaction data in the New Relic UI, go to the main chart on the following pages, and then select the Non-web option in the dropdown: New Relic Explorer: Go to one.newrelic.com > Explorer > (select an app) > Summary.

      "body": "The word transaction can have several different meanings in the software industry. This document explains how the term is used by New Relic and how transactions are reported. What is a transaction? At New Relic, a transaction is defined as one logical unit of work in a software application. Specifically, it refers to the function calls and method calls that make up that unit of work. For APM, it will often refer to a web transaction, which represents activity that happens from when the application receives a web request to when the response is sent. When you install APM in a supported system, it begins automatically reporting web requests and other important functions and methods. To supplement the default level of monitoring, you can set up custom instrumentation to report additional transactions. Some frameworks do not have a natural concept of a transaction. In other words, there are no predefined pathways that can easily be recognized or monitored as transactions. To define transactions in such frameworks, you can use custom instrumentation. Types of transactions Cumulative transaction data appears in APM on the Transactions page. The two main categories of transactions are web and non-web: Web: Transactions are initiated with an HTTP request. For most organizations, these represent customer-centric interactions and thus are the most important transactions to monitor. Non-web: Non-web transactions are not initiated with a web request. They can include non-web worker processes, background processes, scripts, message queue activity, and other tasks. Transaction sub-types Our agents have these transaction sub-types: C SDK Sub-type Description Custom The execution of the named custom transaction. Usually recorded via manual instrumentation APIs. Function The invocation of the named function. Go Doesn't apply. Java Sub-type Description Custom The execution of the named custom transaction. Usually recorded via manual instrumentation APIs. framework The invocation of a framework that is recognized by the agent. .NET Sub-type Description Action The invocation of the named framework action. Used when the agent is able to identify a framework-specific action name. ASP The invocation of an ASP.NET request. Custom The execution of the named custom transaction. Usually recorded via manual instrumentation APIs. MonoRail The invocation of a MonoRail request. MVC The invocation of a MVC request. OpenRasta The invocation of an OpenRasta request. StatusCode The HTTP status code returned for the transaction. Often used when a more specific transaction sub-type is unavailable. WCF The invocation of a WCF request. WebAPI The invocation of a WebAPI request. WebService The invocation of a WebService request. Node.JS Sub-type Description Custom The execution of the named custom transaction. Usually recorded via manual instrumentation APIs. Message Message broker or queue communication. PHP Sub-type Description Action The invocation of the named framework action. Used when the agent is able to identify a framework-specific action name. Custom The execution of the named custom transaction. Usually recorded via manual instrumentation APIs. Function The invocation of the named function. PHP The invocation of a background PHP job. StatusCode The HTTP status code returned for the transaction. Often used when a more specific transaction sub-type is unavailable. unknown The invocation of an unknown web transaction or background job. URI The invocation of the named URI. Usually used when a framework or language level transaction name cannot be determined. Python Sub-type Description ASGIWeb WebTransaction from an ASGI application. Message Message broker or queue communication. WSGIWeb WebTransaction from a WSGI application. Ruby Sub-type Description Custom The execution of the named custom transaction. Usually recorded via manual instrumentation APIs. Transaction segments The individual functions and calls that make up a transaction are called segments. For example external service calls and database calls are segments, and both have their own UI pages in APM. The APM Transactions page displays aggregate transaction segment data. To add segments to a transaction, use custom instrumentation. To see the segments of a specific transaction, use transaction traces. Transaction naming For supported frameworks, transaction names can come from various sources, such as the name given to the transaction by the framework, function names detected during the transaction, or a web request's URL. For transactions that produce many names with a similar format, we consolidate those into general transaction categories. For example, a transaction might be displayed as /user/*/control_panel, where the * represents different user names. To rename transactions or adjust how names are consolidated, use custom instrumentation. Monitoring transactions Here are some other ways you can use APM to monitor transactions: If you want to monitor... Use this... Transactions important to your business Create key transactions, which emphasizes them in the UI and lets you set a custom level of monitoring for them. Async activity Follow the procedures to set up asynchronous activity for your specific APM language agent. Activity across applications Linking transactions across applications gives you more detail about business-relevant application activity. For more information, see the documentation about distributed tracing and cross application traces. Tip To get a high-level overview of all your applications and services, use the New Relic Explorer. Query transactions Transactions are available for querying with an in-depth set of default attributes attached. Using these attributes, you can run queries and create custom charts that APM does not provide by default. For information on how to query your data using our UI or NRQL, see Query New Relic data.",

      "body": "Here are troubleshooting tips when using cross application traces. Note that this feature is not the same as distributed tracing, which is preferred over cross application tracing. Agent versions and protocols Make sure you meet these requirements for your agent's version, protocols, interfaces, or message queue libraries. If you are using a protocol that is not listed here, you will not see a connection between your applications. Agent version Notes C SDK Use distributed tracing. Go 1.11 or higher HTTP, HTTPS Java 3.9.0 or higher HTTP, HTTPs, JMS 1.1, RabbitMQ The Java agent also supports several message queue libraries, including those that use the JMS 1.1 interface. .NET 4.2 or higher HTTP, and supported .NET messaging systems Node.js 2.0.0 or higher HTTP, HTTPS, RabbitMQ PHP 4.19.0 or higher HTTP, HTTPS, and supported PHP message queuing systems Python 2.38.0.31 or higher HTTP, HTTPS, and supported Python message queuing systems Ruby 4.3.0 or higher HTTP, HTTPS, RabbitMQ Config file requirements In general, New Relic's cross application tracing feature is enabled by default. Requirements to change your configuration file vary, depending on your New Relic agent: C SDK (not supported) Go (not supported) Java .NET Node.js (no specific config file settings needed for Node.js) PHP Python Ruby High throughput apps Cross application traces rely on transaction events to associate related transactions. If you have a high throughput application, your agent may reach the maximum number of events that it can record in a minute and will fall back to sampling events. If a transaction’s events are sampled, you may see an incomplete cross application trace, including sometimes only the transactions that you are focused on. If your application has high throughput, some cross application traces will appear incomplete, sometimes with no links. Try viewing a different transaction trace. To reduce or eliminate sampling, you can also adjust the number of transaction events stored in your agent configuration. High throughput apps Troubleshooting tips Java From the transaction_events stanza, adjust the setting for max_samples_stored. Ruby Adjust the setting for analytics_events.max_samples_stored. Proxies If you expect to see a cross application trace link but it consistently does not appear, there may be a proxy or broker between your application’s communication. Cross application tracing relies on HTTP headers and JMS properties being passed from one application to other. HTTP proxies and message brokers sometimes strip those headers. Multi-threaded processing (Java) If one or more of your Java applications uses an async or \"reactive\" programming model, a transaction's activity may span across multiple threads. New Relic supports the Play framework and Servlet Async but not all async frameworks. For unsupported frameworks, activity on other threads is not reported as part of the transaction. Calls to other applications will not be traced. Multiple accounts Currently cross application traces do not cross New Relic accounts. If you have multiple New Relic accounts (including child accounts), you will only see traces for applications within one account. Our distributed tracing feature does cross account boundaries.",

      "body": "This document explains what non-web transactions are in APM, and how you can instrument background tasks and other arbitrary activity to be reported as non-web transactions. What are non-web transactions? The two main APM transaction categories are web and non-web. Web transactions are transactions we detect as being initiated by a web request; they are the most common type of transaction reported by APM. Non-web transactions are transactions that are not web transactions; we do not detect they were initiated by a web request. This includes processes and jobs that do not handle web requests, such as message processing and background tasks. For example, you might schedule something to run periodically on your server to do database work, send emails, etc. The source is not a web request but something on your server. Some non-web transactions from supported frameworks or services are detected automatically by New Relic; others may be created using custom instrumentation. We intentionally separate your web and non-web transactions in the UI. Non-web vs. web transactions Comments Less directly important Non-web transactions are often background processes and tasks, and they are less directly important to your application's users when compared to web transactions. Long running Non-web transactions are often long-running processes. Separating them from web transactions prevents those results from skewing your customer-facing response times. Omitted from Apdex score Combining your non-web transactions with your web transactions would hurt your Apdex score (a measure of satisfaction with load times). This is why Apdex data for non-web transactions does not appear in the UI. Create non-web transactions To create new non-web transactions, follow the procedures for your APM language agent. C SDK Follow the procedures for instrumenting a non-web transaction. Go Follow the procedures for instrumenting a non-web transaction. Java Follow the procedures for instrumenting a transaction (instrumenting a transaction without web request parameters creates a non-web transaction). .NET By default, the APM .NET agent instruments IIS ASP workers. To instrument other (non-IIS) .NET applications, such as standalone (WCF) services, console apps, and other Windows services, see Instrumenting custom applications and Instrumenting WCF applications. Important For IIS applications, you cannot change web transactions to non-web transactions. Node.js Use startBackgroundTransaction(). PHP To mark a transaction as non-web: use newrelic_background_job and set the flag to true. The PHP agent reports all command-line run scripts as non-web transactions. Python See Python agent non-web transactions. The Python agent also supports non-web transaction reporting from Celery and Gearman. Ruby See Ruby agent non-web transactions. View non-web transactions To view non-web transaction data in the New Relic UI, go to the main chart on the following pages, and then select the Non-web option in the dropdown: New Relic Explorer: Go to one.newrelic.com > Explorer > (select an app) > Summary.

      "body": "APM's cross application tracing lets you link transactions between your APM-monitored applications. What is cross application tracing? Important Instead of using cross application tracing, we recommend our distributed tracing features. Distributed tracing is an improvement on the cross application tracing feature and is recommended for large, distributed systems. APM's cross application traces link transactions between APM apps in your service-oriented architecture (SOA). This is useful, for example, to identify performance problems between your own application (the \"calling\" app) and any internal or external services (the \"called\" app), such as traffic to internal services. This helps you to: Spot bottlenecks in your cross application call flows. Understand from end to end how specific transactions are used by other applications and services. Diagnose problems faster and enhance collaboration across teams. Security considerations Cross application tracing relies on three HTTP headers in order to exchange information between the calling and called applications. The first two (X-NewRelic-ID and X-NewRelic-Transaction) appear as HTTP request headers in outgoing requests sent by an instrumented application. The remaining header (X-NewRelic-App-Data) is inserted into the HTTP response if the called application belongs to the same New Relic account as the calling application. New Relic obfuscates all of these headers using an obfuscation scheme identical to what we use for browser monitoring, but with a different key. HTTP header Description X-NewRelic-ID (in request header) Contains the account ID and application ID of the application making the call X-NewRelic-Transaction (in request header) Contains information about an individual transaction created by the call (a GUID unique to the calling transaction, along with information about upstream calls that spawned the transaction) X-NewRelic-App-Data (in the response if applicable) Contains information about the called application, including: Account ID Application ID Name of the called transaction Timing information for the called transaction GUID of the called transaction",

      "body": "The word transaction can have several different meanings in the software industry. This document explains how the term is used by New Relic and how transactions are reported. What is a transaction? At New Relic, a transaction is defined as one logical unit of work in a software application. Specifically, it refers to the function calls and method calls that make up that unit of work. For APM, it will often refer to a web transaction, which represents activity that happens from when the application receives a web request to when the response is sent. When you install APM in a supported system, it begins automatically reporting web requests and other important functions and methods. To supplement the default level of monitoring, you can set up custom instrumentation to report additional transactions. Some frameworks do not have a natural concept of a transaction. In other words, there are no predefined pathways that can easily be recognized or monitored as transactions. To define transactions in such frameworks, you can use custom instrumentation. Types of transactions Cumulative transaction data appears in APM on the Transactions page. The two main categories of transactions are web and non-web: Web: Transactions are initiated with an HTTP request. For most organizations, these represent customer-centric interactions and thus are the most important transactions to monitor. Non-web: Non-web transactions are not initiated with a web request. They can include non-web worker processes, background processes, scripts, message queue activity, and other tasks. Transaction sub-types Our agents have these transaction sub-types: C SDK Sub-type Description Custom The execution of the named custom transaction. Usually recorded via manual instrumentation APIs. Function The invocation of the named function. Go Doesn't apply. Java Sub-type Description Custom The execution of the named custom transaction. Usually recorded via manual instrumentation APIs. framework The invocation of a framework that is recognized by the agent. .NET Sub-type Description Action The invocation of the named framework action. Used when the agent is able to identify a framework-specific action name. ASP The invocation of an ASP.NET request. Custom The execution of the named custom transaction. Usually recorded via manual instrumentation APIs. MonoRail The invocation of a MonoRail request. MVC The invocation of a MVC request. OpenRasta The invocation of an OpenRasta request. StatusCode The HTTP status code returned for the transaction. Often used when a more specific transaction sub-type is unavailable. WCF The invocation of a WCF request. WebAPI The invocation of a WebAPI request. WebService The invocation of a WebService request. Node.JS Sub-type Description Custom The execution of the named custom transaction. Usually recorded via manual instrumentation APIs. Message Message broker or queue communication. PHP Sub-type Description Action The invocation of the named framework action. Used when the agent is able to identify a framework-specific action name. Custom The execution of the named custom transaction. Usually recorded via manual instrumentation APIs. Function The invocation of the named function. PHP The invocation of a background PHP job. StatusCode The HTTP status code returned for the transaction. Often used when a more specific transaction sub-type is unavailable. unknown The invocation of an unknown web transaction or background job. URI The invocation of the named URI. Usually used when a framework or language level transaction name cannot be determined. Python Sub-type Description ASGIWeb WebTransaction from an ASGI application. Message Message broker or queue communication. WSGIWeb WebTransaction from a WSGI application. Ruby Sub-type Description Custom The execution of the named custom transaction. Usually recorded via manual instrumentation APIs. Transaction segments The individual functions and calls that make up a transaction are called segments. For example external service calls and database calls are segments, and both have their own UI pages in APM. The APM Transactions page displays aggregate transaction segment data. To add segments to a transaction, use custom instrumentation. To see the segments of a specific transaction, use transaction traces. Transaction naming For supported frameworks, transaction names can come from various sources, such as the name given to the transaction by the framework, function names detected during the transaction, or a web request's URL. For transactions that produce many names with a similar format, we consolidate those into general transaction categories. For example, a transaction might be displayed as /user/*/control_panel, where the * represents different user names. To rename transactions or adjust how names are consolidated, use custom instrumentation. Monitoring transactions Here are some other ways you can use APM to monitor transactions: If you want to monitor... Use this... Transactions important to your business Create key transactions, which emphasizes them in the UI and lets you set a custom level of monitoring for them. Async activity Follow the procedures to set up asynchronous activity for your specific APM language agent. Activity across applications Linking transactions across applications gives you more detail about business-relevant application activity. For more information, see the documentation about distributed tracing and cross application traces. Tip To get a high-level overview of all your applications and services, use the New Relic Explorer. Query transactions Transactions are available for querying with an in-depth set of default attributes attached. Using these attributes, you can run queries and create custom charts that APM does not provide by default. For information on how to query your data using our UI or NRQL, see Query New Relic data.",

Transaction naming For supported frameworks, transaction names can come from various sources, such as the name given to the transaction by the framework, function names detected during the transaction, or a web request's URL. For transactions that produce many names with a similar format, we consolidate those into general transaction categories. For example, a transaction might be displayed as /user/*/control_panel, where the * represents different user names. To rename transactions or adjust how names are consolidated, use custom instrumentation. Monitoring transactions Here are some other ways you can use APM to monitor transactions: If you want to monitor... Use this... Transactions important to your business Create key transactions, which emphasizes them in the UI and lets you set a custom level of monitoring for them. Async activity Follow the procedures to set up asynchronous activity for your specific APM language agent. Activity across applications Linking transactions across applications gives you more detail about business-relevant application activity. For more information, see the documentation about distributed tracing and cross application traces. Tip To get a high-level overview of all your applications and services, use the New Relic Explorer. Query transactions Transactions are available for querying with an in-depth set of default attributes attached. Using these attributes, you can run queries and create custom charts that APM does not provide by default. For information on how to query your data using our UI or NRQL, see Query New Relic data.",

Trace details page functions Go to one.newrelic.com > APM > (select an app) > Monitor > Transactions > (select a transaction trace) > Trace details. The Trace details page displays a table with the timing data for the segments in a transaction, plus additional features and functions: Trace details page Description Primary trace data, functions The top of each transaction trace UI page shows several primary pieces of data, including the trace time, response time, and, if available, CPU info. Also, sometimes the UI may indicate a partial trace. Available functions include: Delete this trace: When you delete a trace, it cannot be retrieved. Track as key transaction. Duration column The duration of each segment and subsegment is shown as both the number of milliseconds and a percentage of the total transaction time. Especially slow segments are color-coded. Segment column The Segment column displays segment names and counts. Fast and repeat calls may be automatically grouped together. Sometimes you may see Application code as the name of a segment or subsegment. To expand segments, use either of the following: The Expand performance problems button at the top of the page The expand and collapse dropdown arrows next to the segments Drilldown column The Drilldown column may contain icons that link to additional transaction data, if available. Timestamp column The Timestamp column displays the start time of a segment or subsegment, relative to the start of the transaction. For example, a value of 3.150 s indicates that that segment started 3.15 seconds into the transaction. Drilldown options In the Drilldown column, icons indicate that additional data is available: Icon Description Database queries The database icon links to the raw database query for that query segment. Depending on your transaction trace settings, this query can either show as raw data or obfuscated data. If the total time for the segment exceeds the query plan threshold in your settings, the query analysis also will appear, along with a stack trace showing the exact location of the call in your code. Stack traces The magnifying glass links to stack trace details. Aggregate transaction details This icon indicates that cross application tracing details are not available. However, you can select this icon to view aggregated transaction information across multiple invocations of the transaction. Color coding of segment duration data The Duration column of the Trace details table is color-coded: Red: More than 25% of the total transaction time was spent in this segment. Yellow: More than 5% of the total transaction time was spent in this segment. Color-coded durations do not necessarily indicate a problem. Whether the timing is actually a problem depends on what you consider normal and acceptable for your application. Application code in traces If a segment is listed as Application code in the table, it indicates that that section of code was not instrumented. You can use custom instrumentation to get more detail on that part of the code. Segments will often be listed as Application code for partial traces. Partial traces For performance reasons, APM only captures the first 2,000 segments of a transaction trace (900 for Node.js). If a transaction trace exceeds that number of segments, the agent truncates the transaction trace and displays a message at the top of the Details page: This is a partial trace. The APM agents have differing rules for when to truncate segments. APM agent Truncate segment rules C SDK Truncates based on segment priority: The root segment has the highest priority. Segments that have seen distributed tracing activity have second-highest priority. Slow segments have third-highest priority. For more information, see the C SDK's documentation about newrelic_transaction_tracer_config_t on GitHub. Go The segment duration must be greater than the TransactionTracer.SegmentThreshold value set in your Go segment configuration. Java, .NET, Ruby These agents truncate traces chronologically. For more information, see the transaction tracer documentation for Java, .NET, or Ruby as applicable. Node.js The Node.js agent only captures the first 900 segments of a transaction trace. For more information, see Node.js transaction tracer configuration. PHP Truncates based on segment duration; the slowest 2,000 segments are captured for the trace. For more information, see PHP transaction tracer configuration. Python Truncates based on segment duration; the slowest 2,000 segments are captured for the trace. For more information, see Python transaction tracer configuration. Segment grouping rules Transaction traces that have a lot of segments can be hard to interpret. New Relic helps you by automatically grouping fast and/or repeated method calls into a single segment grouping. For example, you might see a segment titled 7 fast method calls. This means that, because of their fast completion, New Relic assumed these calls were unlikely to be a problem and grouped them together. You can expand that grouping to see the individual segments. Rules underlying segment grouping include: Fast calls: When New Relic detects four or more consecutive segments with a duration of 7.5 ms or less, these are grouped into a single collapsed header. Identical calls: When New Relic detects four or more consecutive identical calls, this usually indicates an N+1 problem. These segments are collapsed. Expanding the collapsed node displays only the first three calls, not all calls.",

Transaction tracing was disabled. Transaction traces are enabled by default, but the setting may have been manually disabled. To solve this problem, change the setting back to enable transaction trace settings. The transaction does not meet criteria for tracing. The transaction is not meeting the criteria for being traced. For example: It is responding more quickly than the 4-times-Apdex threshold or a custom number-of-seconds threshold. It is not being selected as the slowest trace during the minute-long harvest cycle. App activity is not being captured as a transaction. If you don't see the transaction listed on the APM Transactions page, your APM agent is not capturing the activity as a transaction. In this situation, you must set up custom instrumentation to monitor the activity as a transaction. The custom transaction name includes brackets. If you used custom instrumentation to manually create a transaction, make sure you follow New Relic's naming rules. Important Do not use brackets [suffix] at the end of your transaction name. New Relic automatically strips brackets from the name. Instead, use parentheses (suffix) or other symbols if needed. No traces appear for any transactions.

      "body": "This document explains what non-web transactions are in APM, and how you can instrument background tasks and other arbitrary activity to be reported as non-web transactions. What are non-web transactions? The two main APM transaction categories are web and non-web. Web transactions are transactions we detect as being initiated by a web request; they are the most common type of transaction reported by APM. Non-web transactions are transactions that are not web transactions; we do not detect they were initiated by a web request. This includes processes and jobs that do not handle web requests, such as message processing and background tasks. For example, you might schedule something to run periodically on your server to do database work, send emails, etc. The source is not a web request but something on your server. Some non-web transactions from supported frameworks or services are detected automatically by New Relic; others may be created using custom instrumentation. We intentionally separate your web and non-web transactions in the UI. Non-web vs. web transactions Comments Less directly important Non-web transactions are often background processes and tasks, and they are less directly important to your application's users when compared to web transactions. Long running Non-web transactions are often long-running processes. Separating them from web transactions prevents those results from skewing your customer-facing response times. Omitted from Apdex score Combining your non-web transactions with your web transactions would hurt your Apdex score (a measure of satisfaction with load times). This is why Apdex data for non-web transactions does not appear in the UI. Create non-web transactions To create new non-web transactions, follow the procedures for your APM language agent. C SDK Follow the procedures for instrumenting a non-web transaction. Go Follow the procedures for instrumenting a non-web transaction. Java Follow the procedures for instrumenting a transaction (instrumenting a transaction without web request parameters creates a non-web transaction). .NET By default, the APM .NET agent instruments IIS ASP workers. To instrument other (non-IIS) .NET applications, such as standalone (WCF) services, console apps, and other Windows services, see Instrumenting custom applications and Instrumenting WCF applications. Important For IIS applications, you cannot change web transactions to non-web transactions. Node.js Use startBackgroundTransaction(). PHP To mark a transaction as non-web: use newrelic_background_job and set the flag to true. The PHP agent reports all command-line run scripts as non-web transactions. Python See Python agent non-web transactions. The Python agent also supports non-web transaction reporting from Celery and Gearman. Ruby See Ruby agent non-web transactions. View non-web transactions To view non-web transaction data in the New Relic UI, go to the main chart on the following pages, and then select the Non-web option in the dropdown: New Relic Explorer: Go to one.newrelic.com > Explorer > (select an app) > Summary.

New Relic automatically strips brackets from the name. Instead, use parentheses (suffix) or other symbols if needed. No traces appear for any transactions. Change the Threshold value temporarily to 0.0001 so that transactions will definitely exceed the threshold. Be sure to return this to your original setting after you start receiving transaction traces.",

      "body": "In APM, you can make a transaction a key transaction when you want it to have a custom level of monitoring, or when you want it to have its own alert policy. These may be web transactions or non-web transactions that are important to your business. For most New Relic agents, a key transaction can be any type of transaction. For the PHP, Node.js, and Go agents, only web transactions can be turned into key transactions. What are key transactions? In APM, making a transaction a key transaction gives you the following benefits: Key transactions are grouped together in the New Relic UI, so they are easy to find and examine. You can set a custom Apdex threshold for a key transaction. You can set an alert policy for a key transaction. Key transactions are useful for: Important transactions. For your app's most important transactions, making them key transactions means you can quickly find and examine them. You can set stricter Apdex requirements for them, and you can create alert policies for them. Slow transactions. If a transaction is regularly slower than other transactions, it can bring down the Apdex score of the entire application. When you make a transaction a key transaction, you can set a longer-duration Apdex threshold for it so it won't bring down your app's Apdex score. Create key transactions To create key transactions, see Create and update key transactions. View key transactions in UI The key transaction's page includes response time and throughput charts, service-level agreement information, a cross application tracing map (if available), and links to alert policy options.

      "body": "The word transaction can have several different meanings in the software industry. This document explains how the term is used by New Relic and how transactions are reported. What is a transaction? At New Relic, a transaction is defined as one logical unit of work in a software application. Specifically, it refers to the function calls and method calls that make up that unit of work. For APM, it will often refer to a web transaction, which represents activity that happens from when the application receives a web request to when the response is sent. When you install APM in a supported system, it begins automatically reporting web requests and other important functions and methods. To supplement the default level of monitoring, you can set up custom instrumentation to report additional transactions. Some frameworks do not have a natural concept of a transaction. In other words, there are no predefined pathways that can easily be recognized or monitored as transactions. To define transactions in such frameworks, you can use custom instrumentation. Types of transactions Cumulative transaction data appears in APM on the Transactions page. The two main categories of transactions are web and non-web: Web: Transactions are initiated with an HTTP request. For most organizations, these represent customer-centric interactions and thus are the most important transactions to monitor. Non-web: Non-web transactions are not initiated with a web request. They can include non-web worker processes, background processes, scripts, message queue activity, and other tasks. Transaction sub-types Our agents have these transaction sub-types: C SDK Sub-type Description Custom The execution of the named custom transaction. Usually recorded via manual instrumentation APIs. Function The invocation of the named function. Go Doesn't apply. Java Sub-type Description Custom The execution of the named custom transaction. Usually recorded via manual instrumentation APIs. framework The invocation of a framework that is recognized by the agent. .NET Sub-type Description Action The invocation of the named framework action. Used when the agent is able to identify a framework-specific action name. ASP The invocation of an ASP.NET request. Custom The execution of the named custom transaction. Usually recorded via manual instrumentation APIs. MonoRail The invocation of a MonoRail request. MVC The invocation of a MVC request. OpenRasta The invocation of an OpenRasta request. StatusCode The HTTP status code returned for the transaction. Often used when a more specific transaction sub-type is unavailable. WCF The invocation of a WCF request. WebAPI The invocation of a WebAPI request. WebService The invocation of a WebService request. Node.JS Sub-type Description Custom The execution of the named custom transaction. Usually recorded via manual instrumentation APIs. Message Message broker or queue communication. PHP Sub-type Description Action The invocation of the named framework action. Used when the agent is able to identify a framework-specific action name. Custom The execution of the named custom transaction. Usually recorded via manual instrumentation APIs. Function The invocation of the named function. PHP The invocation of a background PHP job. StatusCode The HTTP status code returned for the transaction. Often used when a more specific transaction sub-type is unavailable. unknown The invocation of an unknown web transaction or background job. URI The invocation of the named URI. Usually used when a framework or language level transaction name cannot be determined. Python Sub-type Description ASGIWeb WebTransaction from an ASGI application. Message Message broker or queue communication. WSGIWeb WebTransaction from a WSGI application. Ruby Sub-type Description Custom The execution of the named custom transaction. Usually recorded via manual instrumentation APIs. Transaction segments The individual functions and calls that make up a transaction are called segments. For example external service calls and database calls are segments, and both have their own UI pages in APM. The APM Transactions page displays aggregate transaction segment data. To add segments to a transaction, use custom instrumentation. To see the segments of a specific transaction, use transaction traces. Transaction naming For supported frameworks, transaction names can come from various sources, such as the name given to the transaction by the framework, function names detected during the transaction, or a web request's URL. For transactions that produce many names with a similar format, we consolidate those into general transaction categories. For example, a transaction might be displayed as /user/*/control_panel, where the * represents different user names. To rename transactions or adjust how names are consolidated, use custom instrumentation. Monitoring transactions Here are some other ways you can use APM to monitor transactions: If you want to monitor... Use this... Transactions important to your business Create key transactions, which emphasizes them in the UI and lets you set a custom level of monitoring for them. Async activity Follow the procedures to set up asynchronous activity for your specific APM language agent. Activity across applications Linking transactions across applications gives you more detail about business-relevant application activity. For more information, see the documentation about distributed tracing and cross application traces. Tip To get a high-level overview of all your applications and services, use the New Relic Explorer. Query transactions Transactions are available for querying with an in-depth set of default attributes attached. Using these attributes, you can run queries and create custom charts that APM does not provide by default. For information on how to query your data using our UI or NRQL, see Query New Relic data.",

      "body": "The word transaction can have several different meanings in the software industry. This document explains how the term is used by New Relic and how transactions are reported. What is a transaction? At New Relic, a transaction is defined as one logical unit of work in a software application. Specifically, it refers to the function calls and method calls that make up that unit of work. For APM, it will often refer to a web transaction, which represents activity that happens from when the application receives a web request to when the response is sent. When you install APM in a supported system, it begins automatically reporting web requests and other important functions and methods. To supplement the default level of monitoring, you can set up custom instrumentation to report additional transactions. Some frameworks do not have a natural concept of a transaction. In other words, there are no predefined pathways that can easily be recognized or monitored as transactions. To define transactions in such frameworks, you can use custom instrumentation. Types of transactions Cumulative transaction data appears in APM on the Transactions page. The two main categories of transactions are web and non-web: Web: Transactions are initiated with an HTTP request. For most organizations, these represent customer-centric interactions and thus are the most important transactions to monitor. Non-web: Non-web transactions are not initiated with a web request. They can include non-web worker processes, background processes, scripts, message queue activity, and other tasks. Transaction sub-types Our agents have these transaction sub-types: C SDK Sub-type Description Custom The execution of the named custom transaction. Usually recorded via manual instrumentation APIs. Function The invocation of the named function. Go Doesn't apply. Java Sub-type Description Custom The execution of the named custom transaction. Usually recorded via manual instrumentation APIs. framework The invocation of a framework that is recognized by the agent. .NET Sub-type Description Action The invocation of the named framework action. Used when the agent is able to identify a framework-specific action name. ASP The invocation of an ASP.NET request. Custom The execution of the named custom transaction. Usually recorded via manual instrumentation APIs. MonoRail The invocation of a MonoRail request. MVC The invocation of a MVC request. OpenRasta The invocation of an OpenRasta request. StatusCode The HTTP status code returned for the transaction. Often used when a more specific transaction sub-type is unavailable. WCF The invocation of a WCF request. WebAPI The invocation of a WebAPI request. WebService The invocation of a WebService request. Node.JS Sub-type Description Custom The execution of the named custom transaction. Usually recorded via manual instrumentation APIs. Message Message broker or queue communication. PHP Sub-type Description Action The invocation of the named framework action. Used when the agent is able to identify a framework-specific action name. Custom The execution of the named custom transaction. Usually recorded via manual instrumentation APIs. Function The invocation of the named function. PHP The invocation of a background PHP job. StatusCode The HTTP status code returned for the transaction. Often used when a more specific transaction sub-type is unavailable. unknown The invocation of an unknown web transaction or background job. URI The invocation of the named URI. Usually used when a framework or language level transaction name cannot be determined. Python Sub-type Description ASGIWeb WebTransaction from an ASGI application. Message Message broker or queue communication. WSGIWeb WebTransaction from a WSGI application. Ruby Sub-type Description Custom The execution of the named custom transaction. Usually recorded via manual instrumentation APIs. Transaction segments The individual functions and calls that make up a transaction are called segments. For example external service calls and database calls are segments, and both have their own UI pages in APM. The APM Transactions page displays aggregate transaction segment data. To add segments to a transaction, use custom instrumentation. To see the segments of a specific transaction, use transaction traces. Transaction naming For supported frameworks, transaction names can come from various sources, such as the name given to the transaction by the framework, function names detected during the transaction, or a web request's URL. For transactions that produce many names with a similar format, we consolidate those into general transaction categories. For example, a transaction might be displayed as /user/*/control_panel, where the * represents different user names. To rename transactions or adjust how names are consolidated, use custom instrumentation. Monitoring transactions Here are some other ways you can use APM to monitor transactions: If you want to monitor... Use this... Transactions important to your business Create key transactions, which emphasizes them in the UI and lets you set a custom level of monitoring for them. Async activity Follow the procedures to set up asynchronous activity for your specific APM language agent. Activity across applications Linking transactions across applications gives you more detail about business-relevant application activity. For more information, see the documentation about distributed tracing and cross application traces. Tip To get a high-level overview of all your applications and services, use the New Relic Explorer. Query transactions Transactions are available for querying with an in-depth set of default attributes attached. Using these attributes, you can run queries and create custom charts that APM does not provide by default. For information on how to query your data using our UI or NRQL, see Query New Relic data.",

These may be web transactions or non-web transactions that are important to your business. For most New Relic agents, a key transaction can be any type of transaction. For the PHP, Node.js, and Go agents, only web transactions can be turned into key transactions. What are key transactions? In APM, making a transaction a key transaction gives you the following benefits: Key transactions are grouped together in the New Relic UI, so they are easy to find and examine. You can set a custom Apdex threshold for a key transaction. You can set an alert policy for a key transaction. Key transactions are useful for: Important transactions. For your app's most important transactions, making them key transactions means you can quickly find and examine them. You can set stricter Apdex requirements for them, and you can create alert policies for them. Slow transactions. If a transaction is regularly slower than other transactions, it can bring down the Apdex score of the entire application. When you make a transaction a key transaction, you can set a longer-duration Apdex threshold for it so it won't bring down your app's Apdex score. Create key transactions To create key transactions, see Create and update key transactions.

      "body": "The word transaction can have several different meanings in the software industry. This document explains how the term is used by New Relic and how transactions are reported. What is a transaction? At New Relic, a transaction is defined as one logical unit of work in a software application. Specifically, it refers to the function calls and method calls that make up that unit of work. For APM, it will often refer to a web transaction, which represents activity that happens from when the application receives a web request to when the response is sent. When you install APM in a supported system, it begins automatically reporting web requests and other important functions and methods. To supplement the default level of monitoring, you can set up custom instrumentation to report additional transactions. Some frameworks do not have a natural concept of a transaction. In other words, there are no predefined pathways that can easily be recognized or monitored as transactions. To define transactions in such frameworks, you can use custom instrumentation. Types of transactions Cumulative transaction data appears in APM on the Transactions page. The two main categories of transactions are web and non-web: Web: Transactions are initiated with an HTTP request. For most organizations, these represent customer-centric interactions and thus are the most important transactions to monitor. Non-web: Non-web transactions are not initiated with a web request. They can include non-web worker processes, background processes, scripts, message queue activity, and other tasks. Transaction sub-types Our agents have these transaction sub-types: C SDK Sub-type Description Custom The execution of the named custom transaction. Usually recorded via manual instrumentation APIs. Function The invocation of the named function. Go Doesn't apply. Java Sub-type Description Custom The execution of the named custom transaction. Usually recorded via manual instrumentation APIs. framework The invocation of a framework that is recognized by the agent. .NET Sub-type Description Action The invocation of the named framework action. Used when the agent is able to identify a framework-specific action name. ASP The invocation of an ASP.NET request. Custom The execution of the named custom transaction. Usually recorded via manual instrumentation APIs. MonoRail The invocation of a MonoRail request. MVC The invocation of a MVC request. OpenRasta The invocation of an OpenRasta request. StatusCode The HTTP status code returned for the transaction. Often used when a more specific transaction sub-type is unavailable. WCF The invocation of a WCF request. WebAPI The invocation of a WebAPI request. WebService The invocation of a WebService request. Node.JS Sub-type Description Custom The execution of the named custom transaction. Usually recorded via manual instrumentation APIs. Message Message broker or queue communication. PHP Sub-type Description Action The invocation of the named framework action. Used when the agent is able to identify a framework-specific action name. Custom The execution of the named custom transaction. Usually recorded via manual instrumentation APIs. Function The invocation of the named function. PHP The invocation of a background PHP job. StatusCode The HTTP status code returned for the transaction. Often used when a more specific transaction sub-type is unavailable. unknown The invocation of an unknown web transaction or background job. URI The invocation of the named URI. Usually used when a framework or language level transaction name cannot be determined. Python Sub-type Description ASGIWeb WebTransaction from an ASGI application. Message Message broker or queue communication. WSGIWeb WebTransaction from a WSGI application. Ruby Sub-type Description Custom The execution of the named custom transaction. Usually recorded via manual instrumentation APIs. Transaction segments The individual functions and calls that make up a transaction are called segments. For example external service calls and database calls are segments, and both have their own UI pages in APM. The APM Transactions page displays aggregate transaction segment data. To add segments to a transaction, use custom instrumentation. To see the segments of a specific transaction, use transaction traces. Transaction naming For supported frameworks, transaction names can come from various sources, such as the name given to the transaction by the framework, function names detected during the transaction, or a web request's URL. For transactions that produce many names with a similar format, we consolidate those into general transaction categories. For example, a transaction might be displayed as /user/*/control_panel, where the * represents different user names. To rename transactions or adjust how names are consolidated, use custom instrumentation. Monitoring transactions Here are some other ways you can use APM to monitor transactions: If you want to monitor... Use this... Transactions important to your business Create key transactions, which emphasizes them in the UI and lets you set a custom level of monitoring for them. Async activity Follow the procedures to set up asynchronous activity for your specific APM language agent. Activity across applications Linking transactions across applications gives you more detail about business-relevant application activity. For more information, see the documentation about distributed tracing and cross application traces. Tip To get a high-level overview of all your applications and services, use the New Relic Explorer. Query transactions Transactions are available for querying with an in-depth set of default attributes attached. Using these attributes, you can run queries and create custom charts that APM does not provide by default. For information on how to query your data using our UI or NRQL, see Query New Relic data.",

Trace details page functions Go to one.newrelic.com > APM > (select an app) > Monitor > Transactions > (select a transaction trace) > Trace details. The Trace details page displays a table with the timing data for the segments in a transaction, plus additional features and functions: Trace details page Description Primary trace data, functions The top of each transaction trace UI page shows several primary pieces of data, including the trace time, response time, and, if available, CPU info. Also, sometimes the UI may indicate a partial trace. Available functions include: Delete this trace: When you delete a trace, it cannot be retrieved. Track as key transaction. Duration column The duration of each segment and subsegment is shown as both the number of milliseconds and a percentage of the total transaction time. Especially slow segments are color-coded. Segment column The Segment column displays segment names and counts. Fast and repeat calls may be automatically grouped together. Sometimes you may see Application code as the name of a segment or subsegment. To expand segments, use either of the following: The Expand performance problems button at the top of the page The expand and collapse dropdown arrows next to the segments Drilldown column The Drilldown column may contain icons that link to additional transaction data, if available. Timestamp column The Timestamp column displays the start time of a segment or subsegment, relative to the start of the transaction. For example, a value of 3.150 s indicates that that segment started 3.15 seconds into the transaction. Drilldown options In the Drilldown column, icons indicate that additional data is available: Icon Description Database queries The database icon links to the raw database query for that query segment. Depending on your transaction trace settings, this query can either show as raw data or obfuscated data. If the total time for the segment exceeds the query plan threshold in your settings, the query analysis also will appear, along with a stack trace showing the exact location of the call in your code. Stack traces The magnifying glass links to stack trace details. Aggregate transaction details This icon indicates that cross application tracing details are not available. However, you can select this icon to view aggregated transaction information across multiple invocations of the transaction. Color coding of segment duration data The Duration column of the Trace details table is color-coded: Red: More than 25% of the total transaction time was spent in this segment. Yellow: More than 5% of the total transaction time was spent in this segment. Color-coded durations do not necessarily indicate a problem. Whether the timing is actually a problem depends on what you consider normal and acceptable for your application. Application code in traces If a segment is listed as Application code in the table, it indicates that that section of code was not instrumented. You can use custom instrumentation to get more detail on that part of the code. Segments will often be listed as Application code for partial traces. Partial traces For performance reasons, APM only captures the first 2,000 segments of a transaction trace (900 for Node.js). If a transaction trace exceeds that number of segments, the agent truncates the transaction trace and displays a message at the top of the Details page: This is a partial trace. The APM agents have differing rules for when to truncate segments. APM agent Truncate segment rules C SDK Truncates based on segment priority: The root segment has the highest priority. Segments that have seen distributed tracing activity have second-highest priority. Slow segments have third-highest priority. For more information, see the C SDK's documentation about newrelic_transaction_tracer_config_t on GitHub. Go The segment duration must be greater than the TransactionTracer.SegmentThreshold value set in your Go segment configuration. Java, .NET, Ruby These agents truncate traces chronologically. For more information, see the transaction tracer documentation for Java, .NET, or Ruby as applicable. Node.js The Node.js agent only captures the first 900 segments of a transaction trace. For more information, see Node.js transaction tracer configuration. PHP Truncates based on segment duration; the slowest 2,000 segments are captured for the trace. For more information, see PHP transaction tracer configuration. Python Truncates based on segment duration; the slowest 2,000 segments are captured for the trace. For more information, see Python transaction tracer configuration. Segment grouping rules Transaction traces that have a lot of segments can be hard to interpret. New Relic helps you by automatically grouping fast and/or repeated method calls into a single segment grouping. For example, you might see a segment titled 7 fast method calls. This means that, because of their fast completion, New Relic assumed these calls were unlikely to be a problem and grouped them together. You can expand that grouping to see the individual segments. Rules underlying segment grouping include: Fast calls: When New Relic detects four or more consecutive segments with a duration of 7.5 ms or less, these are grouped into a single collapsed header. Identical calls: When New Relic detects four or more consecutive identical calls, this usually indicates an N+1 problem. These segments are collapsed. Expanding the collapsed node displays only the first three calls, not all calls.",

It is not being selected as the slowest trace during the minute-long harvest cycle. App activity is not being captured as a transaction. If you don't see the transaction listed on the APM Transactions page, your APM agent is not capturing the activity as a transaction. In this situation, you must set up custom instrumentation to monitor the activity as a transaction. The custom transaction name includes brackets. If you used custom instrumentation to manually create a transaction, make sure you follow New Relic's naming rules. Important Do not use brackets [suffix] at the end of your transaction name. New Relic automatically strips brackets from the name. Instead, use parentheses (suffix) or other symbols if needed. No traces appear for any transactions.

      "body": "The word transaction can have several different meanings in the software industry. This document explains how the term is used by New Relic and how transactions are reported. What is a transaction? At New Relic, a transaction is defined as one logical unit of work in a software application. Specifically, it refers to the function calls and method calls that make up that unit of work. For APM, it will often refer to a web transaction, which represents activity that happens from when the application receives a web request to when the response is sent. When you install APM in a supported system, it begins automatically reporting web requests and other important functions and methods. To supplement the default level of monitoring, you can set up custom instrumentation to report additional transactions. Some frameworks do not have a natural concept of a transaction. In other words, there are no predefined pathways that can easily be recognized or monitored as transactions. To define transactions in such frameworks, you can use custom instrumentation. Types of transactions Cumulative transaction data appears in APM on the Transactions page. The two main categories of transactions are web and non-web: Web: Transactions are initiated with an HTTP request. For most organizations, these represent customer-centric interactions and thus are the most important transactions to monitor. Non-web: Non-web transactions are not initiated with a web request. They can include non-web worker processes, background processes, scripts, message queue activity, and other tasks. Transaction sub-types Our agents have these transaction sub-types: C SDK Sub-type Description Custom The execution of the named custom transaction. Usually recorded via manual instrumentation APIs. Function The invocation of the named function. Go Doesn't apply. Java Sub-type Description Custom The execution of the named custom transaction. Usually recorded via manual instrumentation APIs. framework The invocation of a framework that is recognized by the agent. .NET Sub-type Description Action The invocation of the named framework action. Used when the agent is able to identify a framework-specific action name. ASP The invocation of an ASP.NET request. Custom The execution of the named custom transaction. Usually recorded via manual instrumentation APIs. MonoRail The invocation of a MonoRail request. MVC The invocation of a MVC request. OpenRasta The invocation of an OpenRasta request. StatusCode The HTTP status code returned for the transaction. Often used when a more specific transaction sub-type is unavailable. WCF The invocation of a WCF request. WebAPI The invocation of a WebAPI request. WebService The invocation of a WebService request. Node.JS Sub-type Description Custom The execution of the named custom transaction. Usually recorded via manual instrumentation APIs. Message Message broker or queue communication. PHP Sub-type Description Action The invocation of the named framework action. Used when the agent is able to identify a framework-specific action name. Custom The execution of the named custom transaction. Usually recorded via manual instrumentation APIs. Function The invocation of the named function. PHP The invocation of a background PHP job. StatusCode The HTTP status code returned for the transaction. Often used when a more specific transaction sub-type is unavailable. unknown The invocation of an unknown web transaction or background job. URI The invocation of the named URI. Usually used when a framework or language level transaction name cannot be determined. Python Sub-type Description ASGIWeb WebTransaction from an ASGI application. Message Message broker or queue communication. WSGIWeb WebTransaction from a WSGI application. Ruby Sub-type Description Custom The execution of the named custom transaction. Usually recorded via manual instrumentation APIs. Transaction segments The individual functions and calls that make up a transaction are called segments. For example external service calls and database calls are segments, and both have their own UI pages in APM. The APM Transactions page displays aggregate transaction segment data. To add segments to a transaction, use custom instrumentation. To see the segments of a specific transaction, use transaction traces. Transaction naming For supported frameworks, transaction names can come from various sources, such as the name given to the transaction by the framework, function names detected during the transaction, or a web request's URL. For transactions that produce many names with a similar format, we consolidate those into general transaction categories. For example, a transaction might be displayed as /user/*/control_panel, where the * represents different user names. To rename transactions or adjust how names are consolidated, use custom instrumentation. Monitoring transactions Here are some other ways you can use APM to monitor transactions: If you want to monitor... Use this... Transactions important to your business Create key transactions, which emphasizes them in the UI and lets you set a custom level of monitoring for them. Async activity Follow the procedures to set up asynchronous activity for your specific APM language agent. Activity across applications Linking transactions across applications gives you more detail about business-relevant application activity. For more information, see the documentation about distributed tracing and cross application traces. Tip To get a high-level overview of all your applications and services, use the New Relic Explorer. Query transactions Transactions are available for querying with an in-depth set of default attributes attached. Using these attributes, you can run queries and create custom charts that APM does not provide by default. For information on how to query your data using our UI or NRQL, see Query New Relic data.",

Trace details page functions Go to one.newrelic.com > APM > (select an app) > Monitor > Transactions > (select a transaction trace) > Trace details. The Trace details page displays a table with the timing data for the segments in a transaction, plus additional features and functions: Trace details page Description Primary trace data, functions The top of each transaction trace UI page shows several primary pieces of data, including the trace time, response time, and, if available, CPU info. Also, sometimes the UI may indicate a partial trace. Available functions include: Delete this trace: When you delete a trace, it cannot be retrieved. Track as key transaction. Duration column The duration of each segment and subsegment is shown as both the number of milliseconds and a percentage of the total transaction time. Especially slow segments are color-coded. Segment column The Segment column displays segment names and counts. Fast and repeat calls may be automatically grouped together. Sometimes you may see Application code as the name of a segment or subsegment. To expand segments, use either of the following: The Expand performance problems button at the top of the page The expand and collapse dropdown arrows next to the segments Drilldown column The Drilldown column may contain icons that link to additional transaction data, if available. Timestamp column The Timestamp column displays the start time of a segment or subsegment, relative to the start of the transaction. For example, a value of 3.150 s indicates that that segment started 3.15 seconds into the transaction. Drilldown options In the Drilldown column, icons indicate that additional data is available: Icon Description Database queries The database icon links to the raw database query for that query segment. Depending on your transaction trace settings, this query can either show as raw data or obfuscated data. If the total time for the segment exceeds the query plan threshold in your settings, the query analysis also will appear, along with a stack trace showing the exact location of the call in your code. Stack traces The magnifying glass links to stack trace details. Aggregate transaction details This icon indicates that cross application tracing details are not available. However, you can select this icon to view aggregated transaction information across multiple invocations of the transaction. Color coding of segment duration data The Duration column of the Trace details table is color-coded: Red: More than 25% of the total transaction time was spent in this segment. Yellow: More than 5% of the total transaction time was spent in this segment. Color-coded durations do not necessarily indicate a problem. Whether the timing is actually a problem depends on what you consider normal and acceptable for your application. Application code in traces If a segment is listed as Application code in the table, it indicates that that section of code was not instrumented. You can use custom instrumentation to get more detail on that part of the code. Segments will often be listed as Application code for partial traces. Partial traces For performance reasons, APM only captures the first 2,000 segments of a transaction trace (900 for Node.js). If a transaction trace exceeds that number of segments, the agent truncates the transaction trace and displays a message at the top of the Details page: This is a partial trace. The APM agents have differing rules for when to truncate segments. APM agent Truncate segment rules C SDK Truncates based on segment priority: The root segment has the highest priority. Segments that have seen distributed tracing activity have second-highest priority. Slow segments have third-highest priority. For more information, see the C SDK's documentation about newrelic_transaction_tracer_config_t on GitHub. Go The segment duration must be greater than the TransactionTracer.SegmentThreshold value set in your Go segment configuration. Java, .NET, Ruby These agents truncate traces chronologically. For more information, see the transaction tracer documentation for Java, .NET, or Ruby as applicable. Node.js The Node.js agent only captures the first 900 segments of a transaction trace. For more information, see Node.js transaction tracer configuration. PHP Truncates based on segment duration; the slowest 2,000 segments are captured for the trace. For more information, see PHP transaction tracer configuration. Python Truncates based on segment duration; the slowest 2,000 segments are captured for the trace. For more information, see Python transaction tracer configuration. Segment grouping rules Transaction traces that have a lot of segments can be hard to interpret. New Relic helps you by automatically grouping fast and/or repeated method calls into a single segment grouping. For example, you might see a segment titled 7 fast method calls. This means that, because of their fast completion, New Relic assumed these calls were unlikely to be a problem and grouped them together. You can expand that grouping to see the individual segments. Rules underlying segment grouping include: Fast calls: When New Relic detects four or more consecutive segments with a duration of 7.5 ms or less, these are grouped into a single collapsed header. Identical calls: When New Relic detects four or more consecutive identical calls, this usually indicates an N+1 problem. These segments are collapsed. Expanding the collapsed node displays only the first three calls, not all calls.",

Transaction tracing was disabled. Transaction traces are enabled by default, but the setting may have been manually disabled. To solve this problem, change the setting back to enable transaction trace settings. The transaction does not meet criteria for tracing. The transaction is not meeting the criteria for being traced. For example: It is responding more quickly than the 4-times-Apdex threshold or a custom number-of-seconds threshold. It is not being selected as the slowest trace during the minute-long harvest cycle. App activity is not being captured as a transaction. If you don't see the transaction listed on the APM Transactions page, your APM agent is not capturing the activity as a transaction. In this situation, you must set up custom instrumentation to monitor the activity as a transaction. The custom transaction name includes brackets. If you used custom instrumentation to manually create a transaction, make sure you follow New Relic's naming rules. Important Do not use brackets [suffix] at the end of your transaction name. New Relic automatically strips brackets from the name. Instead, use parentheses (suffix) or other symbols if needed. No traces appear for any transactions. Change the Threshold value temporarily to 0.0001 so that transactions will definitely exceed the threshold.

To expand segments, use either of the following: The Expand performance problems button at the top of the page The expand and collapse dropdown arrows next to the segments Drilldown column The Drilldown column may contain icons that link to additional transaction data, if available. Timestamp column The Timestamp column displays the start time of a segment or subsegment, relative to the start of the transaction. For example, a value of 3.150 s indicates that that segment started 3.15 seconds into the transaction. Drilldown options In the Drilldown column, icons indicate that additional data is available: Icon Description Database queries The database icon links to the raw database query for that query segment. Depending on your transaction trace settings, this query can either show as raw data or obfuscated data. If the total time for the segment exceeds the query plan threshold in your settings, the query analysis also will appear, along with a stack trace showing the exact location of the call in your code. Stack traces The magnifying glass links to stack trace details. Aggregate transaction details This icon indicates that cross application tracing details are not available. However, you can select this icon to view aggregated transaction information across multiple invocations of the transaction. Color coding of segment duration data The Duration column of the Trace details table is color-coded: Red: More than 25% of the total transaction time was spent in this segment. Yellow: More than 5% of the total transaction time was spent in this segment. Color-coded durations do not necessarily indicate a problem. Whether the timing is actually a problem depends on what you consider normal and acceptable for your application. Application code in traces If a segment is listed as Application code in the table, it indicates that that section of code was not instrumented. You can use custom instrumentation to get more detail on that part of the code. Segments will often be listed as Application code for partial traces. Partial traces For performance reasons, APM only captures the first 2,000 segments of a transaction trace (900 for Node.js). If a transaction trace exceeds that number of segments, the agent truncates the transaction trace and displays a message at the top of the Details page: This is a partial trace. The APM agents have differing rules for when to truncate segments. APM agent Truncate segment rules C SDK Truncates based on segment priority: The root segment has the highest priority. Segments that have seen distributed tracing activity have second-highest priority. Slow segments have third-highest priority. For more information, see the C SDK's documentation about newrelic_transaction_tracer_config_t on GitHub. Go The segment duration must be greater than the TransactionTracer.SegmentThreshold value set in your Go segment configuration. Java, .NET, Ruby These agents truncate traces chronologically. For more information, see the transaction tracer documentation for Java, .NET, or Ruby as applicable. Node.js The Node.js agent only captures the first 900 segments of a transaction trace. For more information, see Node.js transaction tracer configuration. PHP Truncates based on segment duration; the slowest 2,000 segments are captured for the trace. For more information, see PHP transaction tracer configuration. Python Truncates based on segment duration; the slowest 2,000 segments are captured for the trace. For more information, see Python transaction tracer configuration. Segment grouping rules Transaction traces that have a lot of segments can be hard to interpret. New Relic helps you by automatically grouping fast and/or repeated method calls into a single segment grouping. For example, you might see a segment titled 7 fast method calls. This means that, because of their fast completion, New Relic assumed these calls were unlikely to be a problem and grouped them together. You can expand that grouping to see the individual segments. Rules underlying segment grouping include: Fast calls: When New Relic detects four or more consecutive segments with a duration of 7.5 ms or less, these are grouped into a single collapsed header. Identical calls: When New Relic detects four or more consecutive identical calls, this usually indicates an N+1 problem. These segments are collapsed. Expanding the collapsed node displays only the first three calls, not all calls.",

      "body": "The word transaction can have several different meanings in the software industry. This document explains how the term is used by New Relic and how transactions are reported. What is a transaction? At New Relic, a transaction is defined as one logical unit of work in a software application. Specifically, it refers to the function calls and method calls that make up that unit of work. For APM, it will often refer to a web transaction, which represents activity that happens from when the application receives a web request to when the response is sent. When you install APM in a supported system, it begins automatically reporting web requests and other important functions and methods. To supplement the default level of monitoring, you can set up custom instrumentation to report additional transactions. Some frameworks do not have a natural concept of a transaction. In other words, there are no predefined pathways that can easily be recognized or monitored as transactions. To define transactions in such frameworks, you can use custom instrumentation. Types of transactions Cumulative transaction data appears in APM on the Transactions page. The two main categories of transactions are web and non-web: Web: Transactions are initiated with an HTTP request. For most organizations, these represent customer-centric interactions and thus are the most important transactions to monitor. Non-web: Non-web transactions are not initiated with a web request. They can include non-web worker processes, background processes, scripts, message queue activity, and other tasks. Transaction sub-types Our agents have these transaction sub-types: C SDK Sub-type Description Custom The execution of the named custom transaction. Usually recorded via manual instrumentation APIs. Function The invocation of the named function. Go Doesn't apply. Java Sub-type Description Custom The execution of the named custom transaction. Usually recorded via manual instrumentation APIs. framework The invocation of a framework that is recognized by the agent. .NET Sub-type Description Action The invocation of the named framework action. Used when the agent is able to identify a framework-specific action name. ASP The invocation of an ASP.NET request. Custom The execution of the named custom transaction. Usually recorded via manual instrumentation APIs. MonoRail The invocation of a MonoRail request. MVC The invocation of a MVC request. OpenRasta The invocation of an OpenRasta request. StatusCode The HTTP status code returned for the transaction. Often used when a more specific transaction sub-type is unavailable. WCF The invocation of a WCF request. WebAPI The invocation of a WebAPI request. WebService The invocation of a WebService request. Node.JS Sub-type Description Custom The execution of the named custom transaction. Usually recorded via manual instrumentation APIs. Message Message broker or queue communication. PHP Sub-type Description Action The invocation of the named framework action. Used when the agent is able to identify a framework-specific action name. Custom The execution of the named custom transaction. Usually recorded via manual instrumentation APIs. Function The invocation of the named function. PHP The invocation of a background PHP job. StatusCode The HTTP status code returned for the transaction. Often used when a more specific transaction sub-type is unavailable. unknown The invocation of an unknown web transaction or background job. URI The invocation of the named URI. Usually used when a framework or language level transaction name cannot be determined. Python Sub-type Description ASGIWeb WebTransaction from an ASGI application. Message Message broker or queue communication. WSGIWeb WebTransaction from a WSGI application. Ruby Sub-type Description Custom The execution of the named custom transaction. Usually recorded via manual instrumentation APIs. Transaction segments The individual functions and calls that make up a transaction are called segments. For example external service calls and database calls are segments, and both have their own UI pages in APM. The APM Transactions page displays aggregate transaction segment data. To add segments to a transaction, use custom instrumentation. To see the segments of a specific transaction, use transaction traces. Transaction naming For supported frameworks, transaction names can come from various sources, such as the name given to the transaction by the framework, function names detected during the transaction, or a web request's URL. For transactions that produce many names with a similar format, we consolidate those into general transaction categories. For example, a transaction might be displayed as /user/*/control_panel, where the * represents different user names. To rename transactions or adjust how names are consolidated, use custom instrumentation. Monitoring transactions Here are some other ways you can use APM to monitor transactions: If you want to monitor... Use this... Transactions important to your business Create key transactions, which emphasizes them in the UI and lets you set a custom level of monitoring for them. Async activity Follow the procedures to set up asynchronous activity for your specific APM language agent. Activity across applications Linking transactions across applications gives you more detail about business-relevant application activity. For more information, see the documentation about distributed tracing and cross application traces. Tip To get a high-level overview of all your applications and services, use the New Relic Explorer. Query transactions Transactions are available for querying with an in-depth set of default attributes attached. Using these attributes, you can run queries and create custom charts that APM does not provide by default. For information on how to query your data using our UI or NRQL, see Query New Relic data.",

      "body": "The word transaction can have several different meanings in the software industry. This document explains how the term is used by New Relic and how transactions are reported. What is a transaction? At New Relic, a transaction is defined as one logical unit of work in a software application. Specifically, it refers to the function calls and method calls that make up that unit of work. For APM, it will often refer to a web transaction, which represents activity that happens from when the application receives a web request to when the response is sent. When you install APM in a supported system, it begins automatically reporting web requests and other important functions and methods. To supplement the default level of monitoring, you can set up custom instrumentation to report additional transactions. Some frameworks do not have a natural concept of a transaction. In other words, there are no predefined pathways that can easily be recognized or monitored as transactions. To define transactions in such frameworks, you can use custom instrumentation. Types of transactions Cumulative transaction data appears in APM on the Transactions page. The two main categories of transactions are web and non-web: Web: Transactions are initiated with an HTTP request. For most organizations, these represent customer-centric interactions and thus are the most important transactions to monitor. Non-web: Non-web transactions are not initiated with a web request. They can include non-web worker processes, background processes, scripts, message queue activity, and other tasks. Transaction sub-types Our agents have these transaction sub-types: C SDK Sub-type Description Custom The execution of the named custom transaction. Usually recorded via manual instrumentation APIs. Function The invocation of the named function. Go Doesn't apply. Java Sub-type Description Custom The execution of the named custom transaction. Usually recorded via manual instrumentation APIs. framework The invocation of a framework that is recognized by the agent. .NET Sub-type Description Action The invocation of the named framework action. Used when the agent is able to identify a framework-specific action name. ASP The invocation of an ASP.NET request. Custom The execution of the named custom transaction. Usually recorded via manual instrumentation APIs. MonoRail The invocation of a MonoRail request. MVC The invocation of a MVC request. OpenRasta The invocation of an OpenRasta request. StatusCode The HTTP status code returned for the transaction. Often used when a more specific transaction sub-type is unavailable. WCF The invocation of a WCF request. WebAPI The invocation of a WebAPI request. WebService The invocation of a WebService request. Node.JS Sub-type Description Custom The execution of the named custom transaction. Usually recorded via manual instrumentation APIs. Message Message broker or queue communication. PHP Sub-type Description Action The invocation of the named framework action. Used when the agent is able to identify a framework-specific action name. Custom The execution of the named custom transaction. Usually recorded via manual instrumentation APIs. Function The invocation of the named function. PHP The invocation of a background PHP job. StatusCode The HTTP status code returned for the transaction. Often used when a more specific transaction sub-type is unavailable. unknown The invocation of an unknown web transaction or background job. URI The invocation of the named URI. Usually used when a framework or language level transaction name cannot be determined. Python Sub-type Description ASGIWeb WebTransaction from an ASGI application. Message Message broker or queue communication. WSGIWeb WebTransaction from a WSGI application. Ruby Sub-type Description Custom The execution of the named custom transaction. Usually recorded via manual instrumentation APIs. Transaction segments The individual functions and calls that make up a transaction are called segments. For example external service calls and database calls are segments, and both have their own UI pages in APM. The APM Transactions page displays aggregate transaction segment data. To add segments to a transaction, use custom instrumentation. To see the segments of a specific transaction, use transaction traces. Transaction naming For supported frameworks, transaction names can come from various sources, such as the name given to the transaction by the framework, function names detected during the transaction, or a web request's URL. For transactions that produce many names with a similar format, we consolidate those into general transaction categories. For example, a transaction might be displayed as /user/*/control_panel, where the * represents different user names. To rename transactions or adjust how names are consolidated, use custom instrumentation. Monitoring transactions Here are some other ways you can use APM to monitor transactions: If you want to monitor... Use this... Transactions important to your business Create key transactions, which emphasizes them in the UI and lets you set a custom level of monitoring for them. Async activity Follow the procedures to set up asynchronous activity for your specific APM language agent. Activity across applications Linking transactions across applications gives you more detail about business-relevant application activity. For more information, see the documentation about distributed tracing and cross application traces. Tip To get a high-level overview of all your applications and services, use the New Relic Explorer. Query transactions Transactions are available for querying with an in-depth set of default attributes attached. Using these attributes, you can run queries and create custom charts that APM does not provide by default. For information on how to query your data using our UI or NRQL, see Query New Relic data.",

      "body": "In APM, the Trace details tab shows the timing of individual segments in a transaction trace. This document describes the sections and features of the Trace details tab. Trace details page functions Go to one.newrelic.com > APM > (select an app) > Monitor > Transactions > (select a transaction trace) > Trace details. The Trace details page displays a table with the timing data for the segments in a transaction, plus additional features and functions: Trace details page Description Primary trace data, functions The top of each transaction trace UI page shows several primary pieces of data, including the trace time, response time, and, if available, CPU info. Also, sometimes the UI may indicate a partial trace. Available functions include: Delete this trace: When you delete a trace, it cannot be retrieved. Track as key transaction. Duration column The duration of each segment and subsegment is shown as both the number of milliseconds and a percentage of the total transaction time. Especially slow segments are color-coded. Segment column The Segment column displays segment names and counts. Fast and repeat calls may be automatically grouped together. Sometimes you may see Application code as the name of a segment or subsegment. To expand segments, use either of the following: The Expand performance problems button at the top of the page The expand and collapse dropdown arrows next to the segments Drilldown column The Drilldown column may contain icons that link to additional transaction data, if available. Timestamp column The Timestamp column displays the start time of a segment or subsegment, relative to the start of the transaction. For example, a value of 3.150 s indicates that that segment started 3.15 seconds into the transaction. Drilldown options In the Drilldown column, icons indicate that additional data is available: Icon Description Database queries The database icon links to the raw database query for that query segment. Depending on your transaction trace settings, this query can either show as raw data or obfuscated data. If the total time for the segment exceeds the query plan threshold in your settings, the query analysis also will appear, along with a stack trace showing the exact location of the call in your code. Stack traces The magnifying glass links to stack trace details. Aggregate transaction details This icon indicates that cross application tracing details are not available. However, you can select this icon to view aggregated transaction information across multiple invocations of the transaction. Color coding of segment duration data The Duration column of the Trace details table is color-coded: Red: More than 25% of the total transaction time was spent in this segment. Yellow: More than 5% of the total transaction time was spent in this segment. Color-coded durations do not necessarily indicate a problem. Whether the timing is actually a problem depends on what you consider normal and acceptable for your application. Application code in traces If a segment is listed as Application code in the table, it indicates that that section of code was not instrumented. You can use custom instrumentation to get more detail on that part of the code. Segments will often be listed as Application code for partial traces. Partial traces For performance reasons, APM only captures the first 2,000 segments of a transaction trace (900 for Node.js). If a transaction trace exceeds that number of segments, the agent truncates the transaction trace and displays a message at the top of the Details page: This is a partial trace. The APM agents have differing rules for when to truncate segments. APM agent Truncate segment rules C SDK Truncates based on segment priority: The root segment has the highest priority. Segments that have seen distributed tracing activity have second-highest priority. Slow segments have third-highest priority. For more information, see the C SDK's documentation about newrelic_transaction_tracer_config_t on GitHub. Go The segment duration must be greater than the TransactionTracer.SegmentThreshold value set in your Go segment configuration. Java, .NET, Ruby These agents truncate traces chronologically. For more information, see the transaction tracer documentation for Java, .NET, or Ruby as applicable. Node.js The Node.js agent only captures the first 900 segments of a transaction trace. For more information, see Node.js transaction tracer configuration. PHP Truncates based on segment duration; the slowest 2,000 segments are captured for the trace. For more information, see PHP transaction tracer configuration. Python Truncates based on segment duration; the slowest 2,000 segments are captured for the trace. For more information, see Python transaction tracer configuration. Segment grouping rules Transaction traces that have a lot of segments can be hard to interpret. New Relic helps you by automatically grouping fast and/or repeated method calls into a single segment grouping. For example, you might see a segment titled 7 fast method calls. This means that, because of their fast completion, New Relic assumed these calls were unlikely to be a problem and grouped them together. You can expand that grouping to see the individual segments. Rules underlying segment grouping include: Fast calls: When New Relic detects four or more consecutive segments with a duration of 7.5 ms or less, these are grouped into a single collapsed header. Identical calls: When New Relic detects four or more consecutive identical calls, this usually indicates an N+1 problem. These segments are collapsed. Expanding the collapsed node displays only the first three calls, not all calls.",

      "body": "The word transaction can have several different meanings in the software industry. This document explains how the term is used by New Relic and how transactions are reported. What is a transaction? At New Relic, a transaction is defined as one logical unit of work in a software application. Specifically, it refers to the function calls and method calls that make up that unit of work. For APM, it will often refer to a web transaction, which represents activity that happens from when the application receives a web request to when the response is sent. When you install APM in a supported system, it begins automatically reporting web requests and other important functions and methods. To supplement the default level of monitoring, you can set up custom instrumentation to report additional transactions. Some frameworks do not have a natural concept of a transaction. In other words, there are no predefined pathways that can easily be recognized or monitored as transactions. To define transactions in such frameworks, you can use custom instrumentation. Types of transactions Cumulative transaction data appears in APM on the Transactions page. The two main categories of transactions are web and non-web: Web: Transactions are initiated with an HTTP request. For most organizations, these represent customer-centric interactions and thus are the most important transactions to monitor. Non-web: Non-web transactions are not initiated with a web request. They can include non-web worker processes, background processes, scripts, message queue activity, and other tasks. Transaction sub-types Our agents have these transaction sub-types: C SDK Sub-type Description Custom The execution of the named custom transaction. Usually recorded via manual instrumentation APIs. Function The invocation of the named function. Go Doesn't apply. Java Sub-type Description Custom The execution of the named custom transaction. Usually recorded via manual instrumentation APIs. framework The invocation of a framework that is recognized by the agent. .NET Sub-type Description Action The invocation of the named framework action. Used when the agent is able to identify a framework-specific action name. ASP The invocation of an ASP.NET request. Custom The execution of the named custom transaction. Usually recorded via manual instrumentation APIs. MonoRail The invocation of a MonoRail request. MVC The invocation of a MVC request. OpenRasta The invocation of an OpenRasta request. StatusCode The HTTP status code returned for the transaction. Often used when a more specific transaction sub-type is unavailable. WCF The invocation of a WCF request. WebAPI The invocation of a WebAPI request. WebService The invocation of a WebService request. Node.JS Sub-type Description Custom The execution of the named custom transaction. Usually recorded via manual instrumentation APIs. Message Message broker or queue communication. PHP Sub-type Description Action The invocation of the named framework action. Used when the agent is able to identify a framework-specific action name. Custom The execution of the named custom transaction. Usually recorded via manual instrumentation APIs. Function The invocation of the named function. PHP The invocation of a background PHP job. StatusCode The HTTP status code returned for the transaction. Often used when a more specific transaction sub-type is unavailable. unknown The invocation of an unknown web transaction or background job. URI The invocation of the named URI. Usually used when a framework or language level transaction name cannot be determined. Python Sub-type Description ASGIWeb WebTransaction from an ASGI application. Message Message broker or queue communication. WSGIWeb WebTransaction from a WSGI application. Ruby Sub-type Description Custom The execution of the named custom transaction. Usually recorded via manual instrumentation APIs. Transaction segments The individual functions and calls that make up a transaction are called segments. For example external service calls and database calls are segments, and both have their own UI pages in APM. The APM Transactions page displays aggregate transaction segment data. To add segments to a transaction, use custom instrumentation. To see the segments of a specific transaction, use transaction traces. Transaction naming For supported frameworks, transaction names can come from various sources, such as the name given to the transaction by the framework, function names detected during the transaction, or a web request's URL. For transactions that produce many names with a similar format, we consolidate those into general transaction categories. For example, a transaction might be displayed as /user/*/control_panel, where the * represents different user names. To rename transactions or adjust how names are consolidated, use custom instrumentation. Monitoring transactions Here are some other ways you can use APM to monitor transactions: If you want to monitor... Use this... Transactions important to your business Create key transactions, which emphasizes them in the UI and lets you set a custom level of monitoring for them. Async activity Follow the procedures to set up asynchronous activity for your specific APM language agent. Activity across applications Linking transactions across applications gives you more detail about business-relevant application activity. For more information, see the documentation about distributed tracing and cross application traces. Tip To get a high-level overview of all your applications and services, use the New Relic Explorer. Query transactions Transactions are available for querying with an in-depth set of default attributes attached. Using these attributes, you can run queries and create custom charts that APM does not provide by default. For information on how to query your data using our UI or NRQL, see Query New Relic data.",

      "body": "New Relic collects and reports information on web transactions and non-web transactions, such as background tasks. New Relic normally produces complete information automatically, without any need to modify your application code. However, if you are not using a supported framework, you may need to add custom instrumentation. Custom instrumentation is also useful to: Add detail to your transaction traces. Block instrumentation on selected transactions you do not want instrumented. Instrument a part of your code that New Relic simply is not picking up. Custom instrumentation that creates a new transaction collects both metric timeslice and event data. Custom instrumentation for already instrumented transactions collects only metric timeslice data. Important Do not use brackets [suffix] at the end of your transaction name. New Relic automatically strips brackets from the name. Instead, use parentheses (suffix) or other symbols if needed. When to use custom instrumentation Custom instrumentation allows you to track interactions that are not captured by New Relic's automatic instrumentation. Custom instrumentation can also add detail to your transaction traces, to help you identify key issues. New Relic collects data from many frameworks automatically. If you are using a supported framework, you should not need custom instrumentation to collect metric timeslices, events, and traces. However, if you encounter any of these situations, you may need custom instrumentation: Transactions do not appear in the UI. Transaction traces include large blocks of application code time without full detail. If you are using a supported framework, but are not seeing transaction on the APM Transactions page, get support at support.newrelic.com to ensure the framework instrumentation is working. Implement custom instrumentation Each agent implements custom instrumentation differently: C SDK custom instrumentation For applications monitored by the C SDK, you must manually instrument transactions, segments, and errors. For more information, see the C SDK instrumentation procedures. Go custom instrumentation Because Golang apps run from a compiled, native binary file, all New Relic instrumentation must be done manually. See Instrument Go transactions and Instrument Go segments for how to set up instrumentation in your Go app. Java custom instrumentation New Relic's Java agent supports two methods of custom instrumentation: Annotation: Add @Trace annotations to your code to ensure New Relic instruments specific methods. Annotation is easy to implement, if you are instrumenting only a few methods. For more complex instrumentation, or if you are unable to modify your code, use XML. XML: Define the methods you want New Relic to monitor in an XML file. XML instrumentation is flexible and doesn't require editing your code, but is more difficult to troubleshoot than annotation. For more information, see Java custom instrumentation. .NET custom instrumentation New Relic's .NET agent supports two methods of custom instrumentation: Attributes: Annotate your code with agent API calls to instrument specific methods. Annotation is easy to implement, but requires editing your source code. XML: Define the methods you want New Relic to instrument in an XML file. XML instrumentation does not require modifying your source code, but is more complicated to create and keep updated than attribute instrumentation. For more information, see Introduction to .NET custom instrumentation. Node.js custom instrumentation New Relic's Node.js agent uses API calls for custom instrumentation. For more information, see Node.js custom instrumentation. PHP custom instrumentation New Relic's PHP agent uses API calls for custom instrumentation. For more information, see PHP custom instrumentation. Python custom instrumentation New Relic's Python agent supports two methods of custom instrumentation: Configuration file: Use the agent configuration file to specify the functions and methods you want instrumented. The agent configuration file is easy to set up, and it does not require you to modify your code. However, it is less flexible than API calls. API calls: Edit your code to call the New Relic Python API. The API is more flexible than instrumentation via the configuration file, but it requires you to modify your code. For more information, see Python custom instrumentation. Ruby custom instrumentation New Relic's Ruby agent uses API calls to define target methods and add transaction tracers to them. For more information, see Ruby custom instrumentation. Grouping issues A metric grouping issue occurs when an account sends too many differently-named metric timeslices to New Relic, and those individual web transactions are not properly aggregated. For example, rather than a single /user/controlpanel/ metric name, you might see /user/controlpanel/alice, /user/controlpanel/bob, and /user/controlpanel/carol. Custom instrumentation can cause metric grouping issues if you introduce too many uniquely-named metric timeslices that New Relic cannot effectively group. If you send thousands of metrics, New Relic may apply rules to reduce the number of transactions.",

      "body": "In APM, the Trace details tab shows the timing of individual segments in a transaction trace. This document describes the sections and features of the Trace details tab. Trace details page functions Go to one.newrelic.com > APM > (select an app) > Monitor > Transactions > (select a transaction trace) > Trace details. The Trace details page displays a table with the timing data for the segments in a transaction, plus additional features and functions: Trace details page Description Primary trace data, functions The top of each transaction trace UI page shows several primary pieces of data, including the trace time, response time, and, if available, CPU info. Also, sometimes the UI may indicate a partial trace. Available functions include: Delete this trace: When you delete a trace, it cannot be retrieved. Track as key transaction. Duration column The duration of each segment and subsegment is shown as both the number of milliseconds and a percentage of the total transaction time. Especially slow segments are color-coded. Segment column The Segment column displays segment names and counts. Fast and repeat calls may be automatically grouped together. Sometimes you may see Application code as the name of a segment or subsegment. To expand segments, use either of the following: The Expand performance problems button at the top of the page The expand and collapse dropdown arrows next to the segments Drilldown column The Drilldown column may contain icons that link to additional transaction data, if available. Timestamp column The Timestamp column displays the start time of a segment or subsegment, relative to the start of the transaction. For example, a value of 3.150 s indicates that that segment started 3.15 seconds into the transaction. Drilldown options In the Drilldown column, icons indicate that additional data is available: Icon Description Database queries The database icon links to the raw database query for that query segment. Depending on your transaction trace settings, this query can either show as raw data or obfuscated data. If the total time for the segment exceeds the query plan threshold in your settings, the query analysis also will appear, along with a stack trace showing the exact location of the call in your code. Stack traces The magnifying glass links to stack trace details. Aggregate transaction details This icon indicates that cross application tracing details are not available. However, you can select this icon to view aggregated transaction information across multiple invocations of the transaction. Color coding of segment duration data The Duration column of the Trace details table is color-coded: Red: More than 25% of the total transaction time was spent in this segment. Yellow: More than 5% of the total transaction time was spent in this segment. Color-coded durations do not necessarily indicate a problem. Whether the timing is actually a problem depends on what you consider normal and acceptable for your application. Application code in traces If a segment is listed as Application code in the table, it indicates that that section of code was not instrumented. You can use custom instrumentation to get more detail on that part of the code. Segments will often be listed as Application code for partial traces. Partial traces For performance reasons, APM only captures the first 2,000 segments of a transaction trace (900 for Node.js). If a transaction trace exceeds that number of segments, the agent truncates the transaction trace and displays a message at the top of the Details page: This is a partial trace. The APM agents have differing rules for when to truncate segments. APM agent Truncate segment rules C SDK Truncates based on segment priority: The root segment has the highest priority. Segments that have seen distributed tracing activity have second-highest priority. Slow segments have third-highest priority. For more information, see the C SDK's documentation about newrelic_transaction_tracer_config_t on GitHub. Go The segment duration must be greater than the TransactionTracer.SegmentThreshold value set in your Go segment configuration. Java, .NET, Ruby These agents truncate traces chronologically. For more information, see the transaction tracer documentation for Java, .NET, or Ruby as applicable. Node.js The Node.js agent only captures the first 900 segments of a transaction trace. For more information, see Node.js transaction tracer configuration. PHP Truncates based on segment duration; the slowest 2,000 segments are captured for the trace. For more information, see PHP transaction tracer configuration. Python Truncates based on segment duration; the slowest 2,000 segments are captured for the trace. For more information, see Python transaction tracer configuration. Segment grouping rules Transaction traces that have a lot of segments can be hard to interpret. New Relic helps you by automatically grouping fast and/or repeated method calls into a single segment grouping. For example, you might see a segment titled 7 fast method calls. This means that, because of their fast completion, New Relic assumed these calls were unlikely to be a problem and grouped them together. You can expand that grouping to see the individual segments. Rules underlying segment grouping include: Fast calls: When New Relic detects four or more consecutive segments with a duration of 7.5 ms or less, these are grouped into a single collapsed header. Identical calls: When New Relic detects four or more consecutive identical calls, this usually indicates an N+1 problem. These segments are collapsed. Expanding the collapsed node displays only the first three calls, not all calls.",

      "body": "New Relic collects and reports information on web transactions and non-web transactions, such as background tasks. New Relic normally produces complete information automatically, without any need to modify your application code. However, if you are not using a supported framework, you may need to add custom instrumentation. Custom instrumentation is also useful to: Add detail to your transaction traces. Block instrumentation on selected transactions you do not want instrumented. Instrument a part of your code that New Relic simply is not picking up. Custom instrumentation that creates a new transaction collects both metric timeslice and event data. Custom instrumentation for already instrumented transactions collects only metric timeslice data. Important Do not use brackets [suffix] at the end of your transaction name. New Relic automatically strips brackets from the name. Instead, use parentheses (suffix) or other symbols if needed. When to use custom instrumentation Custom instrumentation allows you to track interactions that are not captured by New Relic's automatic instrumentation. Custom instrumentation can also add detail to your transaction traces, to help you identify key issues. New Relic collects data from many frameworks automatically. If you are using a supported framework, you should not need custom instrumentation to collect metric timeslices, events, and traces. However, if you encounter any of these situations, you may need custom instrumentation: Transactions do not appear in the UI. Transaction traces include large blocks of application code time without full detail. If you are using a supported framework, but are not seeing transaction on the APM Transactions page, get support at support.newrelic.com to ensure the framework instrumentation is working. Implement custom instrumentation Each agent implements custom instrumentation differently: C SDK custom instrumentation For applications monitored by the C SDK, you must manually instrument transactions, segments, and errors. For more information, see the C SDK instrumentation procedures. Go custom instrumentation Because Golang apps run from a compiled, native binary file, all New Relic instrumentation must be done manually. See Instrument Go transactions and Instrument Go segments for how to set up instrumentation in your Go app. Java custom instrumentation New Relic's Java agent supports two methods of custom instrumentation: Annotation: Add @Trace annotations to your code to ensure New Relic instruments specific methods. Annotation is easy to implement, if you are instrumenting only a few methods. For more complex instrumentation, or if you are unable to modify your code, use XML. XML: Define the methods you want New Relic to monitor in an XML file. XML instrumentation is flexible and doesn't require editing your code, but is more difficult to troubleshoot than annotation. For more information, see Java custom instrumentation. .NET custom instrumentation New Relic's .NET agent supports two methods of custom instrumentation: Attributes: Annotate your code with agent API calls to instrument specific methods. Annotation is easy to implement, but requires editing your source code. XML: Define the methods you want New Relic to instrument in an XML file. XML instrumentation does not require modifying your source code, but is more complicated to create and keep updated than attribute instrumentation. For more information, see Introduction to .NET custom instrumentation. Node.js custom instrumentation New Relic's Node.js agent uses API calls for custom instrumentation. For more information, see Node.js custom instrumentation. PHP custom instrumentation New Relic's PHP agent uses API calls for custom instrumentation. For more information, see PHP custom instrumentation. Python custom instrumentation New Relic's Python agent supports two methods of custom instrumentation: Configuration file: Use the agent configuration file to specify the functions and methods you want instrumented. The agent configuration file is easy to set up, and it does not require you to modify your code. However, it is less flexible than API calls. API calls: Edit your code to call the New Relic Python API. The API is more flexible than instrumentation via the configuration file, but it requires you to modify your code. For more information, see Python custom instrumentation. Ruby custom instrumentation New Relic's Ruby agent uses API calls to define target methods and add transaction tracers to them. For more information, see Ruby custom instrumentation. Grouping issues A metric grouping issue occurs when an account sends too many differently-named metric timeslices to New Relic, and those individual web transactions are not properly aggregated. For example, rather than a single /user/controlpanel/ metric name, you might see /user/controlpanel/alice, /user/controlpanel/bob, and /user/controlpanel/carol. Custom instrumentation can cause metric grouping issues if you introduce too many uniquely-named metric timeslices that New Relic cannot effectively group. If you send thousands of metrics, New Relic may apply rules to reduce the number of transactions.",

      "body": "When we say auto-telemetry, we’re not talking about cars — we're talking about instant baseline visibility into your Kubernetes clusters. With the New Relic One integration with Pixie, you get similar data to traditional language agents, but without manually instrumenting your code or redeploying your application. Pixie auto-telemetry is powered by eBPF, a virtual machine-like construct that enables Pixie to seamlessly collect fine-grained telemetry data — service-level metrics, unsampled requests, and more. With one install command, you get deeper insight into your Kubernetes clusters and workloads. No language agents required. Live debugging with Pixie shows a service graph listing the namespaces and the node that are available on the current cluster. Simply put, Auto-telemetry with Pixie offers the quickest option for getting observability into your Kubernetes services. Quickly start observing and debugging Kubernetes clusters Our Pixie integration gives you the best of both worlds: Pixie’s fast and simple Kubernetes observability coupled with New Relic One’s incident correlation, intelligent alerting, and long-term retention. You’ll get visibility into HTTP services using golden signals, HTTP transactions, database transactions, distributed tracing, and JVM metrics. You can operate, debug, and scale your Kubernetes clusters based on the information you learn about how your clusters and services are running. Using the New Relic Explorer, you can see key metrics and events at every level, starting with the cluster, and diving down into namespaces, deployments, and pods. You can quickly spot anomalous behavior, and where it’s happening. And then dive deeper using embedded visualizations of your Pixie data. Quickly identify hot spots with Flamegraph. On the Live debugging with Pixie tab, answer questions like what SQL requests your app is making or which services are talking to each other. Important Auto-Telemetry with Pixie leverages Community Cloud with Pixie, a separate platform from New Relic One. Use of Community Cloud with Pixie is subject to separate terms of service. Install Auto-telemetry with Pixie Use our guided installation process to install Auto-telemetry with Pixie. This deploys Pixie with New Relic's Kubernetes integration on your cluster. You don't need to do any further configuration or installation to start using Pixie. If you want to install Auto-telemetry with Pixie on multiple clusters, re-run the guided install for each additional cluster. Before you begin Review this Pixie data security overview for actions to take to secure your data. Make sure you have sufficient memory: Pixie requires 2Gb of memory per node in your cluster. Review the other Pixie technical requirements. You must be a full user. Other user-related requirements: For users on original user model: cannot be a Restricted User. For users on New Relic One user model: must be assigned to a group that has a role with Pixie-related capabilities. Important If you are already a Pixie user, you must still install using the guided installation steps described below. This will provide the API keys that you need. Install from the beginning of the guided install process Open our New Relic One guided install. Select the account you want to use for the guided install, and click Continue. Note: if you have a single account, you won't see this option. Select Kubernetes and then continue with step one in the next section. Install from the Configure the HELM command/manifest (yaml) file If you arrived in the guided installation process by following a link from Pixie or from within New Relic, your steps begin here. Select the account and cluster for the install. If needed, select a namespace. Important Currently, Pixie performs best on clusters with up to 100 nodes (exceeding 100 nodes can lead to excessive memory usage and scripts failing to run). Friendly reminder: autoscaling can quickly drive up your node numbers. Click Continue. Select the data you want to gather, observe, and debug, and click Continue. On the Choose install method page, select either Helm or manifest. Helm method Copy the Helm command that's provided, and then run it on your command line. See this page about installing the Kubernetes integration using Helm to learn more about the process. Helm installs a bundle containing the New Relic infrastructure agent, an integration to gather Prometheus metrics and Kubernetes events, and the Pixie integration. The deployment takes a few minutes to complete. To see the status of the install to the cluster, run kubectl get pods -n newrelic. manifest method Run the provided command in your console, and insert the path to your downloaded manifest. If you're running your Kubernetes cluster in the cloud, see the additional steps in the Kubernetes docs. Click Continue to open the Listening for data page. When you get the message, See your data, click Kubernetes Cluster Explorer to see your cluster. Auto-telemetry with Pixie might restart after installation. This is caused by the auto update feature. Explore your cluster In the cluster explorer, you can get a quick overview of the nodes in your cluster, including CPU, memory, and storage, as well as the status of each pod (healthy, warning, or critical). You can also find out what services are running in each container, their latency, throughput, and error rate. For more information about using the cluster explorer, see Navigate the Kubernetes cluster explorer. Tip Containers might be listed for up to four hours after they get decommissioned. You can query the Pixie data in New Relic One and create dashboards for at-a-glance monitoring. Find the data model and sample queries here. Investigate usage spikes with Flamegraph Debugging is orders of magnitude easier when you can quickly see what your application is doing. Flamegraph, a Pixie always-on visualization, requires no instrumentation, redeploying, or recompiling. It works for compiled languages like Go, C+, Rust, to name a few. And at a glance, Flamegraph tells you what functions your application is spending time on and where you have hot spots. Flamegraph is especially useful for hierarchical resource use, like disk usage and CPU utilization. For more information on how to read Flamegraph, see the Pixie documentation. Debug live On the Live debugging with Pixie tab, run PxL scripts — scripts written in Pixie's PxL language — to view live data captured through eBPF. Select the script drop-down and then select a script to run in the tab. (For best results, select a time range that is recent in the time picker.) Scripts enable you to debug: Traffic in multiple formats: HTTP and HTTPs (including encrypted), DNS, Postgres, MySQL, Cassandra, Redis (currently supporting SQL and HTTP in beta).

      "body": "Auto-telemetry with Pixie is New Relic One's integration of Community Cloud for Pixie, a managed version of Pixie open source software. Auto-telemetry with Pixie therefore benefits from Pixie's approach to keeping data secure. The data that Pixie collects is stored entirely within your Kubernetes cluster. This data does not persist outside of your environment, and will never be stored by Community Cloud for Pixie. This means that your sensitive data remains within your environment and control. Community Cloud for Pixie makes queries directly to your Kubernetes cluster to access the data. In order for the query results to be shown in the Community Cloud for Pixie UI, CLI, and API, the data is sent to the client from your cluster using a reverse proxy. Community Cloud for Pixie’s reverse proxy is designed to ensure: Data is ephemeral. It only passes through the Community Cloud for Pixie's cloud proxy in transit. This ensures data locality. Data is encrypted while in transit. Only you are able to read your data. New Relic One fetches and stores data that related to an application's performance. With Auto-telemetry with Pixie, a predefined subset of data persists outside of your cluster. This data is stored in Telemetry Data Platform, in the your selected region. This data persists in order to give you long-term storage, alerting, correlation with additional data, and the ability to use advanced New Relic platform capabilities, such as anomaly detection. The persisted performance metrics include, but are not limited to: Golden metrics (throughput, latency, error rate) for HTTP-based services HTTP transaction data Database transaction data (for MySQL & PostgreSQL) Distributed tracing JVM metrics The data you view on the Live debugging tab comes through Community Cloud for Pixie, and is therefore potentially sensitive. It is not stored by New Relic and is ephemeral and queryable for less than 24 hours. Control who has access to Pixie data If you want to manage which members of your organization can view Pixie data in New Relic One, as well as install and delete Pixie links, you can create a custom role. Note that this option is available only to Enterprise and Pro level customers. For more information, see New Relic's user model. Manage auto-update and two-way communication Pixie maintains an active two-way communication channel from your host system to Community Cloud with Pixie at withpixie.ai. Pixie uses this communication channel to query data, push updates, and retrieve metadata and health checks about Pixie and your Kubernetes cluster. By default, Pixie queries withpixie.ai to check if new updates have been pushed and then automatically installs them if they’re present. To disable auto updates, you must set a flag prior to the install process using either Helm or in the newrelic-manifest.yaml file. To disable automatic updates, choose one: Helm option Add --set pixie-chart.disableAutoUpdate=true to your Helm command. newrelic-manifest.yaml option in your newrelic-manifest.yaml file under the pl-cluster-config section, add PL_DISABLE_AUTO_UPDATE: \"true\" to the data directive.

      "body": "When we say auto-telemetry, we’re not talking about cars — we're talking about instant baseline visibility into your Kubernetes clusters. With the New Relic One integration with Pixie, you get similar data to traditional language agents, but without manually instrumenting your code or redeploying your application. Pixie auto-telemetry is powered by eBPF, a virtual machine-like construct that enables Pixie to seamlessly collect fine-grained telemetry data — service-level metrics, unsampled requests, and more. With one install command, you get deeper insight into your Kubernetes clusters and workloads. No language agents required. Live debugging with Pixie shows a service graph listing the namespaces and the node that are available on the current cluster. Simply put, Auto-telemetry with Pixie offers the quickest option for getting observability into your Kubernetes services. Quickly start observing and debugging Kubernetes clusters Our Pixie integration gives you the best of both worlds: Pixie’s fast and simple Kubernetes observability coupled with New Relic One’s incident correlation, intelligent alerting, and long-term retention. You’ll get visibility into HTTP services using golden signals, HTTP transactions, database transactions, distributed tracing, and JVM metrics. You can operate, debug, and scale your Kubernetes clusters based on the information you learn about how your clusters and services are running. Using the New Relic Explorer, you can see key metrics and events at every level, starting with the cluster, and diving down into namespaces, deployments, and pods. You can quickly spot anomalous behavior, and where it’s happening. And then dive deeper using embedded visualizations of your Pixie data. Quickly identify hot spots with Flamegraph. On the Live debugging with Pixie tab, answer questions like what SQL requests your app is making or which services are talking to each other. Important Auto-Telemetry with Pixie leverages Community Cloud with Pixie, a separate platform from New Relic One. Use of Community Cloud with Pixie is subject to separate terms of service. Install Auto-telemetry with Pixie Use our guided installation process to install Auto-telemetry with Pixie. This deploys Pixie with New Relic's Kubernetes integration on your cluster. You don't need to do any further configuration or installation to start using Pixie. If you want to install Auto-telemetry with Pixie on multiple clusters, re-run the guided install for each additional cluster. Before you begin Review this Pixie data security overview for actions to take to secure your data. Make sure you have sufficient memory: Pixie requires 2Gb of memory per node in your cluster. Review the other Pixie technical requirements. You must be a full user. Other user-related requirements: For users on original user model: cannot be a Restricted User. For users on New Relic One user model: must be assigned to a group that has a role with Pixie-related capabilities. Important If you are already a Pixie user, you must still install using the guided installation steps described below. This will provide the API keys that you need. Install from the beginning of the guided install process Open our New Relic One guided install. Select the account you want to use for the guided install, and click Continue. Note: if you have a single account, you won't see this option. Select Kubernetes and then continue with step one in the next section. Install from the Configure the HELM command/manifest (yaml) file If you arrived in the guided installation process by following a link from Pixie or from within New Relic, your steps begin here. Select the account and cluster for the install. If needed, select a namespace. Important Currently, Pixie performs best on clusters with up to 100 nodes (exceeding 100 nodes can lead to excessive memory usage and scripts failing to run). Friendly reminder: autoscaling can quickly drive up your node numbers. Click Continue. Select the data you want to gather, observe, and debug, and click Continue. On the Choose install method page, select either Helm or manifest. Helm method Copy the Helm command that's provided, and then run it on your command line. See this page about installing the Kubernetes integration using Helm to learn more about the process. Helm installs a bundle containing the New Relic infrastructure agent, an integration to gather Prometheus metrics and Kubernetes events, and the Pixie integration. The deployment takes a few minutes to complete. To see the status of the install to the cluster, run kubectl get pods -n newrelic. manifest method Run the provided command in your console, and insert the path to your downloaded manifest. If you're running your Kubernetes cluster in the cloud, see the additional steps in the Kubernetes docs. Click Continue to open the Listening for data page. When you get the message, See your data, click Kubernetes Cluster Explorer to see your cluster. Auto-telemetry with Pixie might restart after installation. This is caused by the auto update feature. Explore your cluster In the cluster explorer, you can get a quick overview of the nodes in your cluster, including CPU, memory, and storage, as well as the status of each pod (healthy, warning, or critical). You can also find out what services are running in each container, their latency, throughput, and error rate. For more information about using the cluster explorer, see Navigate the Kubernetes cluster explorer. Tip Containers might be listed for up to four hours after they get decommissioned. You can query the Pixie data in New Relic One and create dashboards for at-a-glance monitoring. Find the data model and sample queries here. Investigate usage spikes with Flamegraph Debugging is orders of magnitude easier when you can quickly see what your application is doing. Flamegraph, a Pixie always-on visualization, requires no instrumentation, redeploying, or recompiling. It works for compiled languages like Go, C+, Rust, to name a few. And at a glance, Flamegraph tells you what functions your application is spending time on and where you have hot spots. Flamegraph is especially useful for hierarchical resource use, like disk usage and CPU utilization. For more information on how to read Flamegraph, see the Pixie documentation. Debug live On the Live debugging with Pixie tab, run PxL scripts — scripts written in Pixie's PxL language — to view live data captured through eBPF. Select the script drop-down and then select a script to run in the tab. (For best results, select a time range that is recent in the time picker.) Scripts enable you to debug: Traffic in multiple formats: HTTP and HTTPs (including encrypted), DNS, Postgres, MySQL, Cassandra, Redis (currently supporting SQL and HTTP in beta).

Learn more: Service Performance tutorial. Network traffic maps to learn which nodes are talking to each other. Learn more: Network Monitoring tutorial. Monitor resource usage by Node and Pod. Learn more: Infra health tutorial. If you don't find the script you need, you can write your own PxL scripts. Find more information about available scripts in Pixie's open source repo.",

      "body": "When we say auto-telemetry, we’re not talking about cars — we're talking about instant baseline visibility into your Kubernetes clusters. With the New Relic One integration with Pixie, you get similar data to traditional language agents, but without manually instrumenting your code or redeploying your application. Pixie auto-telemetry is powered by eBPF, a virtual machine-like construct that enables Pixie to seamlessly collect fine-grained telemetry data — service-level metrics, unsampled requests, and more. With one install command, you get deeper insight into your Kubernetes clusters and workloads. No language agents required. Live debugging with Pixie shows a service graph listing the namespaces and the node that are available on the current cluster. Simply put, Auto-telemetry with Pixie offers the quickest option for getting observability into your Kubernetes services. Quickly start observing and debugging Kubernetes clusters Our Pixie integration gives you the best of both worlds: Pixie’s fast and simple Kubernetes observability coupled with New Relic One’s incident correlation, intelligent alerting, and long-term retention. You’ll get visibility into HTTP services using golden signals, HTTP transactions, database transactions, distributed tracing, and JVM metrics. You can operate, debug, and scale your Kubernetes clusters based on the information you learn about how your clusters and services are running. Using the New Relic Explorer, you can see key metrics and events at every level, starting with the cluster, and diving down into namespaces, deployments, and pods. You can quickly spot anomalous behavior, and where it’s happening. And then dive deeper using embedded visualizations of your Pixie data. Quickly identify hot spots with Flamegraph. On the Live debugging with Pixie tab, answer questions like what SQL requests your app is making or which services are talking to each other. Important Auto-Telemetry with Pixie leverages Community Cloud with Pixie, a separate platform from New Relic One. Use of Community Cloud with Pixie is subject to separate terms of service. Install Auto-telemetry with Pixie Use our guided installation process to install Auto-telemetry with Pixie. This deploys Pixie with New Relic's Kubernetes integration on your cluster. You don't need to do any further configuration or installation to start using Pixie. If you want to install Auto-telemetry with Pixie on multiple clusters, re-run the guided install for each additional cluster. Before you begin Review this Pixie data security overview for actions to take to secure your data. Make sure you have sufficient memory: Pixie requires 2Gb of memory per node in your cluster. Review the other Pixie technical requirements. You must be a full user. Other user-related requirements: For users on original user model: cannot be a Restricted User. For users on New Relic One user model: must be assigned to a group that has a role with Pixie-related capabilities. Important If you are already a Pixie user, you must still install using the guided installation steps described below. This will provide the API keys that you need. Install from the beginning of the guided install process Open our New Relic One guided install. Select the account you want to use for the guided install, and click Continue. Note: if you have a single account, you won't see this option. Select Kubernetes and then continue with step one in the next section. Install from the Configure the HELM command/manifest (yaml) file If you arrived in the guided installation process by following a link from Pixie or from within New Relic, your steps begin here. Select the account and cluster for the install. If needed, select a namespace. Important Currently, Pixie performs best on clusters with up to 100 nodes (exceeding 100 nodes can lead to excessive memory usage and scripts failing to run). Friendly reminder: autoscaling can quickly drive up your node numbers. Click Continue. Select the data you want to gather, observe, and debug, and click Continue. On the Choose install method page, select either Helm or manifest. Helm method Copy the Helm command that's provided, and then run it on your command line. See this page about installing the Kubernetes integration using Helm to learn more about the process. Helm installs a bundle containing the New Relic infrastructure agent, an integration to gather Prometheus metrics and Kubernetes events, and the Pixie integration. The deployment takes a few minutes to complete. To see the status of the install to the cluster, run kubectl get pods -n newrelic. manifest method Run the provided command in your console, and insert the path to your downloaded manifest. If you're running your Kubernetes cluster in the cloud, see the additional steps in the Kubernetes docs. Click Continue to open the Listening for data page. When you get the message, See your data, click Kubernetes Cluster Explorer to see your cluster. Auto-telemetry with Pixie might restart after installation. This is caused by the auto update feature. Explore your cluster In the cluster explorer, you can get a quick overview of the nodes in your cluster, including CPU, memory, and storage, as well as the status of each pod (healthy, warning, or critical). You can also find out what services are running in each container, their latency, throughput, and error rate. For more information about using the cluster explorer, see Navigate the Kubernetes cluster explorer. Tip Containers might be listed for up to four hours after they get decommissioned. You can query the Pixie data in New Relic One and create dashboards for at-a-glance monitoring. Find the data model and sample queries here. Investigate usage spikes with Flamegraph Debugging is orders of magnitude easier when you can quickly see what your application is doing. Flamegraph, a Pixie always-on visualization, requires no instrumentation, redeploying, or recompiling. It works for compiled languages like Go, C+, Rust, to name a few. And at a glance, Flamegraph tells you what functions your application is spending time on and where you have hot spots. Flamegraph is especially useful for hierarchical resource use, like disk usage and CPU utilization. For more information on how to read Flamegraph, see the Pixie documentation. Debug live On the Live debugging with Pixie tab, run PxL scripts — scripts written in Pixie's PxL language — to view live data captured through eBPF. Select the script drop-down and then select a script to run in the tab. (For best results, select a time range that is recent in the time picker.) Scripts enable you to debug: Traffic in multiple formats: HTTP and HTTPs (including encrypted), DNS, Postgres, MySQL, Cassandra, Redis (currently supporting SQL and HTTP in beta).

      "body": "Application remediation involves gathering metrics and performance statistics about your application. This helps you identify bottlenecks and errors that can lead to instability in your software (and frustration for your users). New Relic provides views of your application’s performance to help you quickly identify and remediate errors. These quick wins ensure you and your colleagues can accelerate the momentum of DevOps in your organization. 1. Use semantic naming throughout New Relic Use semantic naming to give meaningful, structured names and labels to the applications you’re monitoring. Create a scalable syntax that can be understood, filtered, and sorted by any team who might use New Relic now or in the future. When you create your naming structure, be sure to consider growth and the potential for scaling/changes in your application’s architecture. Consider the following naming structure: store--us-web-prod store--us-web-stage store--us-web-dev This structure allows for additions to scale (for example, store-eu-web-prod-02), and makes the application’s environment searchable. Any convention you use should be unique to your organization’s structure, but be sure to use a convention that will allow you to optimize your environment as need. 2. Deploy the New Relic agent Review the compatibility and requirements for New Relic agents and products, and then follow the documentation to install the appropriate agent in your application. Once the agent is installed, you should see data begin to populate in New Relic within minutes. Tip If after several minutes, New Relic is not showing performance information, see No data appears. 3. Identify application performance outliers and errors The default charts in New Relic tell a story about your application’s performance. If there are performance issues, patterns in the charts highlight the causes. The following figure, from the Overview page in APM, shows a large spike occurred at noon on March 27th, and was nearly double the response time of our application’s overall trend: one.newrelic.com > APM > (select an app) > Monitoring > Overview Additionally, the response time breakdown shows a spike in Web external (which indicates downstream dependencies). Since the spike seems to correlate with periods of higher throughput, we can then use the Throughput chart to analyze the problem in more detail. 4. Drill into specific time frames Click and drag on a graph, to drill into a focused time slice of performance data to better isolate any issue you’re investigating. In this example, we’ve narrowed the view on the spike we saw in web transactions times: one.newrelic.com > APM > (select an app) > Monitoring > Overview Here, it’s obvious that some part of Web external, which is an application or service called by our Web portal app, is likely the source of the issue. 5. Drill into transaction traces to investigate outliers New Relic displays transactions ordered with the most time consuming transaction at the top. Click a transaction to navigate to the Transactions page and expand that transaction into its component parts and see any transaction traces that have been captured as a result of any performance issues. New Relic automatically captures these traces whenever a transaction violates your Apdex score by more than four times for a specific number of seconds. Tip If you’re not capturing any transaction traces, you may not be violating these thresholds. Be sure to configure transaction traces for your applications as needed. In the following example, we see that interceptor.ServletConfigInter... has significant transaction times: one.newrelic.com > APM > (select an app) > Monitoring > Overview In fact, it’s responsible for 99.9% of the app server time, which means we’re getting closer to identifying the culprit of our spike. Here, we see the same spike from before, but the performance of the transaction is broken down into its components: one.newrelic.com > APM > (select an app) > Monitoring > Overview While the share of the response times for most components of this transaction remained stable, GetPlansController (in brown) spiked massively. From the Transaction traces table, we can drill further into the transaction trace to get method-level detail of where the issue is occurring. 6. Identify performance outliers in the database We identified that GetPlansController is consuming the vast majority of our response time. Here we see it in the transaction trace summary: one.newrelic.com > APM > (select an app) > Monitoring > Overview Trace details shows an execution timeline of this transaction, and we see that Plan Service is the external transaction causing the issues—the red color-coding indicates the problem. one.newrelic.com > APM > (select an app) > Monitoring > Overview From this point, we can navigate to the Transactions summary page for Plan Service: one.newrelic.com > APM > (select an app) > Monitoring > Transactions The breakdown of the GetPlans transaction shows that database calls, particularly MySQL PlansTable select, appear to be a significant portion of the overall response time. The Breakdown table further identifies the problem: the number of database calls per transaction is very high. Note again that it’s highlighted in red. one.newrelic.com > APM > (select an app) > Monitoring > Transactions Once again, we can look at a transaction trace to find what might be causing these queries. one.newrelic.com > APM > (select an app) > Monitoring > Transactions Finally we find that an extremely large number of select methods account for the majority of transaction time. We can now take steps to address this potential N+1 query problem. After we remediate this issue, improved response times will lead to fewer frustrated requests and more satisfied customers—which will be reflected in this application's Apdex score. 7. Explore and Resolve Clusters of Errors When you need to track down what causes errors in your app, it may not be easy to identify the cause. Using applied intelligence developed by New Relic, APM Error Profiles automatically compare one set of events to another. An error profile is a collection of attributes with significantly different traits compared to non-errors. New Relic displays pie charts that sorts error attributes by the greatest deviation from the “norm.\" For backend errors, go to APM, select Error Analytics in the left nav, and then click on the Error Profile tab. In this example, the culprit is obviously a web transaction validating coupons, and now you can view the error stack trace, message, and the line of code from which the error was thrown. one.newrelic.com > APM > (select an app) > Error Analytics > Error Profile As a quality customer experience increasingly relies on complex client-side logic, it’s important to quickly analyze and understand JavaScript errors. From one.newrelic.com, click Browser in the top header, and then click JS errors in left navigation menu. Expand the details about JavaScript errors by clicking on a attribute. In this case, we've expanded the transaction names that are related to the errors: one.newrelic.com > Browser > (select an app) > JS errors Roughly half of the errors come from phone.jsp, so that is the place to start investigating. Then determine if you can safely ignore the error, or if you should resolve the error with code edits and a new deployment, or provide communication about the issue to your customers. Now that you have dealt with performance outliers and clusters of errors, you are well on your way to optimizing your application so you can baseline it for trend analysis.

DistributedTraceSummary MobileRequest MobileRequestError Span Transaction TransactionError InfrastructureEvent Data sources : InfrastructureCloudTrail InfrastructureEvent describes changes (deltas) that occur in a system's live state. When an inventory or system state is added, removed, or changed, Infrastructure will produce an InfrastructureEvent that logs that activity. Attribute name Definition Data types category A New Relic category used to organize events in the UI. For example: automation, notification, and service. InfrastructureEvent changeType A simple classification of the type of change made to the entity: added, modified, or removed. InfrastructureEvent changedPath The fully specified name of the item that changed. This is constructed by taking the source and adding one or more additional path elements that uniquely identify the item that changed. InfrastructureEvent deltaId Delta refers to a recorded change in the system. The deltaId is a number used by New Relic to organize incoming inventory change data. InfrastructureEvent eventId The unique ID of the event, generated by New Relic. InfrastructureEvent format The type of infrastructure event. Each format type includes attributes that may be used to render the event in the UI. InfrastructureEvent newStatus The new agent status: disconnected or connected. InfrastructureEvent newValue If a change is made to the entity, this attribute contains the new value of the inventory that was changed. This will have no value if no change has been made. The value will display approximately 4K bytes of data. InfrastructureEvent oldValue If a change is made to the entity, this attribute contains the old value of the inventory that was changed. This will be blank if no change has been made. InfrastructureEvent provider For integrations that use generic event types (like the DatastoreSample event), the provider value specifies the source of the data (the service, or a sub-category of data from that service). Some Insights events are generic and are used by several integrations. For example, the DatastoreSample event is used by several integrations, including the AWS DynamoDB integration and the AWS RDS integration. In these cases, the provider attribute value represents the source of that attribute. This will usually be the service that data comes from or, for integrations that use several provider values, a certain sub-category of data from that service. When a provider value is present for a generic event, that event will have additional integration-specific attributes attached to it. Here’s an example of an Insights NRQL query that returns the attributes present for a DatastoreSample event reported by the AWS RDS integration: SELECT * from DatastoreSample where provider = 'RdsDbCluster' InfrastructureEvent source The fully specified origin of this inventory item. This is typically in the form category/plugin, where plugin is the generic word used for the tool that gathered this data. InfrastructureEvent summary A summary of the change that happened. Uses a human-friendly string, such as Agent disconnected. InfrastructureEvent violationUpdateType The type of change to the violation: For example: open or closed.

      "body": "Your end-user experience depends on your entire technology stack. You need to quickly understand what's causing a customer complaint or issue. Did the problem come from your infrastructure, your application, or the browsers that ultimately render it? Is it the result of a problematic internet provider, a problem in your own data center with failing CPU or memory, or something else? More than Real User Monitoring (RUM) Many websites contain dynamic content that is loaded after the initial page has finished loading, and complex JavaScript code increases the need for error reporting. Browser monitoring in New Relic One provides a Real User Monitoring (RUM) solution that measures the speed and performance of your end users as they navigate to your site from different web browsers, devices, operating systems, and networks. With browser monitoring in New Relic One, you see actionable data about your end users' experience with your app. But browser monitoring in New Relic goes far beyond the initial page load to measure full page life cycle data. For example, our browser UI shows you: Actual performance data, such as by page view popularity and user satisfaction (Apdex) scores Perceived performance data that measures how quickly your async or dynamic visuals and interactive page contents display JavaScript error analytics, stack traces, and line-of-code visibility, to show you the end-user steps leading up to an error itself Session performance with a detailed timeline and heat map of the load and interaction events during a webpage's full life cycle AJAX requests indicating problems with timing, end points, and specific locations in the webpage Hash-based route changes in apps with single-page application (SPA) architectures These tools (and more!) help your teams optimize your end users' page load experience, eliminate bugs, and troubleshoot faster across your full stack. Examine user perceptions Real user data gives insights into actual page performance, but you also need to look into your users' perception of your site's performance. Pages can load content in many different ways, and users control when they interact with that content. This is why some user-centric performance metrics happen outside the standard window onload (page load time) in the browser monitoring agent. The PageViewTiming event provides a more real-time delivery mechanism that does not have a dependency on any other event. Additional metrics include: First paint, first contentful paint, and largest contentful paint First input delay First interaction This helps you understand how users experience your site, both from visual and responsiveness standpoints. Improve interactive app performance Our single-page app (SPA) monitoring automatically tracks route changes, initial page loads, and synchronous and asynchronous activity during browser interactions. You can also use our browser agent and SPA API to monitor virtually anything that executes inside the browser. If you are a developer, SPA monitoring can help you: Create faster, more responsive, highly interactive apps. Monitor the throughput and performance that real users are experiencing. Troubleshoot and resolve problems within the context of the page load. Query and visualize the data to assist with business decisions. Bring better apps to the marketplace more quickly. Correlate front-end and back-end problems With New Relic One, you can instrument any type of data you need, such as metrics, events, logs, and traces. This helps you find actionable data about your end users' experience across the stack. For example: Full-Stack Observability Comments Locations or domains Limit browser monitoring to focus on specific geographical locations or specific types of end-user activity. You can also monitor or block specific domains. Trends in interactions Use our comparative charting feature for a direct page load time comparison between real user (browser) interactions and trends appearing in Synthetic monitors. Distributed tracing Isolate latency from the web browser through back-end services with distributed tracing. The UI helps you see the connection across across a full transaction, from browser activity, to time spent in network, to back-end activity. Browser types Explore your end users' experience with your app segmented by any types of browsers they use, including: Top browsers by throughput Average page load time by platform type (mobile, desktop, and other) Selected browser type by version (for example, Chrome 31, 32, 33, etc.) This helps you quickly determine whether problems with page load timing may be related to a specific browser type or platform, or whether the problem is more widespread. Get started with browser monitoring Follow these basic steps, and you'll quickly be up and running in New Relic with browser monitoring! Review the compatibility details and basic requirements for browser monitoring. Install the browser agent. Go to [one.newrelic.com > Explorer > Browser applications. Use the Explorer to access all your entities, that is, anything we can identify that reports data, from applications and hosts to custom groupings of any elements. View summary data from your Browser summary page, then drill down into page load timing details and other UI data. Configure your alerts for key performance data, or use our Applied Intelligence solutions to reduce alert noise, correlate incidents, and automatically detect anomalies. Query and visualize your default data (or customize your own), then analyze what that data says about your business. Customize and share your own charts and dashboards.",

      "body": "Browser monitoring's JavaScript snippet introduces a nearly invisible impact on website performance and user perception of the time it takes a page to load. The JavaScript is included in a packet of webpage data that is sent anyway. In addition, it immediately begins monitoring for errors and events as the rest of the webpage executes. The negligible amount of overhead required to load the JavaScript results in a significant return of actionable data. Contents Overall impact The JavaScript's overhead takes into consideration both the impact on the user and the impact on your systems' performance: User perception: Typically users cannot detect performance degradations on a website of less than 200ms. Browser's JavaScript adds less than 15ms in aggregated time per page load. This is split up over time, so at no point would a user be able to perceive any performance impact due to the JavaScript. Webserver and systems: Browser app monitoring occurs on the user's browser, not on the server. Processing time does not have an impact on your CPU consumption. In addition, we take additional steps to minimize any potential impact on the apps and webpages being monitored. For example, the \"loader\" script is loaded synchronously in the <HEAD> in order to ensure monitoring is enabled for the entire life cycle of the page. This script is included inline, which eliminates the need for another roundtrip network request to a content delivery network (CDN). The \"loader\" comes with the initial page load. Later in the life cycle of the page, New Relic loads an additional monitoring script asynchronously. This script should not have any perceivable effect to the user and is included in the overall overhead of less than 15ms per page. Network impact Browser monitoring also minimizes network traffic for the end user by aggregating data locally (in the client) and sending it back to New Relic on load, at periodic intervals, on unload, or when data has been collected. (During the browser session's idle periods, transmissions may not be required.) For more help Additional documentation resources include: Instrumentation for page load timing (JavaScript elements, data transmission) Browser monitoring and search engine optimization (how browser ensures that the JavaScript has a negligible impact on SEO)",

Transaction tracing was disabled. Transaction traces are enabled by default, but the setting may have been manually disabled. To solve this problem, change the setting back to enable transaction trace settings. The transaction does not meet criteria for tracing. The transaction is not meeting the criteria for being traced. For example: It is responding more quickly than the 4-times-Apdex threshold or a custom number-of-seconds threshold. It is not being selected as the slowest trace during the minute-long harvest cycle. App activity is not being captured as a transaction. If you don't see the transaction listed on the APM Transactions page, your APM agent is not capturing the activity as a transaction. In this situation, you must set up custom instrumentation to monitor the activity as a transaction. The custom transaction name includes brackets. If you used custom instrumentation to manually create a transaction, make sure you follow New Relic's naming rules. Important Do not use brackets [suffix] at the end of your transaction name. New Relic automatically strips brackets from the name. Instead, use parentheses (suffix) or other symbols if needed. No traces appear for any transactions. Change the Threshold value temporarily to 0.0001 so that transactions will definitely exceed the threshold. Be sure to return this to your original setting after you start receiving transaction traces.",

      "body": "Browser monitoring supports the uploading of source maps, which are used to un-minify error stack traces on the JS errors page. This document explains how to use the API to publish (upload) source maps to browser. Prepare for using the source map API In order to upload source maps to browser via the API, you'll need this information: A user API key (before November 20, 2020, the Admin API key was required; that will still work if already in place) The New Relic application ID for the deployed app The full JavaScript file URL Optionally, if the JavaScript URL doesn't automatically have release info appended to it, the release name and ID What is the JavaScript URL? Every time the agent captures an error in your code, it's associated with the URL of the JavaScript in which it occurred. This is the src attribute of the script tag in your HTML. This full JavaScript URL is required when sending source maps to browser. You can find the URL for an error's JavaScript file in browser, on the JS errors page. See Browser monitoring source maps for more on finding these errors in the UI. Is a release name and ID required? Many organizations include a version number or hash in the JavaScript URL. This is generally added to \"bust\" caches to ensure your users get the most recent version of your code. This type of URL might look something like: https://example.com/assets/application-59.min.js https://example.com/assets/bundle-d6d031.min.js https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/jquery/3.1.1/jquery.js If your app's URLs automatically have the version info appended to it, the browser agent has everything it needs in order to match errors with your code. You can move ahead to generating source maps. If this doesn't apply to you, and JS URLs do not have version info appended, you’ll have to assist the agent by specifying a release name and ID with the API. Are there limits to source map uploads? There is no limit to the overall number of source maps you can upload. However, the API is rate-limited: You can upload a maximum of 100 source maps per minute You can upload a maximum of 5,000 source maps per day Source map files can be a maximum of 50Mb in size. Push source maps to New Relic Now that you have one or more source maps, you are ready to publish it to browser. You can use any of these methods to send source maps to browser: Use the New Relic npm module with the API via the command line or via a client-side JavaScript build/deploy script like Gulp or Grunt. Use API curl commands. Use the browser UI. Use npm module via command line or client-side script The easiest and recommended way to upload source maps to browser is to use the our new @newrelic/publish-sourcemap npm module. It provides a command line tool and Javascript API to accomplish this task. More documentation is available in the npm repo. Here are some examples of using the npm module via the command line. Important The following examples are for US accounts. For EU accounts, the endpoint is https://sourcemaps.service.eu.newrelic.com. For more information, see Introduction to the EU region data center. npm command line: Publish Here's an example of uploading source maps using the npm module via the command line. Note that the source map can come from a local file or a remote URL. npm install -g @newrelic/publish-sourcemap publish-sourcemap PATH_TO_SOURCE_MAP_FILE (local or remote) PATH_TO_ORIGINAL_FILE --apiKey=YOUR_NEW_RELIC_USER_API_KEY --applicationId=YOUR_NEW_RELIC_APP_ID Copy npm command line: List published maps Here's an example of listing published source maps: list-sourcemaps --applicationId=YOUR_APP_ID --apiKey=YOUR_NEW_RELIC_USER_KEY Options: --applicationId Browser application id --apiKey New Relic user API key Copy npm command line: Delete Here's an example of deleting a source map: delete-sourcemap --applicationId=YOUR_APP_ID --apiKey=YOUR_NEW_RELIC_USER_API_KEY --sourcemapId=YOUR_SOURCE_MAP_ID Options: --applicationId Browser application id --apiKey New Relic user API key --sourcemapId Unique id generated for a source map Copy Here are some examples of using the npm module to publish from client-side JavaScript: npm via Node.js script: Publish Here's an example of publishing a source map via a Node.js script: var publishSourcemap = require(‘@newrelic/publish-sourcemap’).publishSourcemap publishSourcemap({ sourcemapPath: 'SOURCE_MAP_FULL_PATH', javascriptUrl: 'JS_URL', applicationId: YOUR_NEW_RELIC_APP_ID, apiKey: 'YOUR_NEW_RELIC_USER_API_KEY' }, function (err) { console.log(err || 'Sourcemap upload done')}) Copy npm via Node.js script: List published maps Here's an example of listing all published source maps: var listSourcemaps = require(‘@newrelic/publish-sourcemap’).listSourcemaps listSourcemaps({ sourcemapPath: 'SOURCE_MAP_FULL_PATH', javascriptUrl: 'JS_URL', applicationId: YOUR_NEW_RELIC_APP_ID, apiKey: 'YOUR_NEW_RELIC_USER_API_KEY', }, function (err, res) { console.log(err || res.body)}) Copy npm via Node.js script: Delete Here's an example of deleting a source map file via a Node.js script: var deleteSourcemap = require(‘@newrelic/publish-sourcemap’).deleteSourcemap deleteSourcemap({ sourcemapId: 'SOURCE_MAP_ID', applicationId: YOUR_NEW_RELIC_APP_ID, apiKey: 'YOUR_NEW_RELIC_USER_API_KEY', }, function (err) { console.log(err || 'Deleted source map')}) Copy When you're done, go to the JS errors page in browser, select an error grouping, and see if your error stack traces have been un-minified. Use API via curl Below are some examples of using curl to publish, list, and delete source maps: curl: Upload maps An example of using API via curl to publish maps to browser: curl -H \"Api-Key: YOUR_NEW_RELIC_USER_API_KEY\" \\ -F \"sourcemap=@SOURCE_MAP_PATH\" \\ -F \"javascriptUrl=JS_URL\" \\ -F \"releaseId=YOUR_RELEASE_ID\" \\ -F \"releaseName=YOUR_UI_PAGE\" \\ https://sourcemaps.service.newrelic.com/v2/applications/YOUR_NEW_RELIC_APP_ID/sourcemaps Copy curl: List existing maps Below is an example of how to get a list of source maps previously uploaded to New Relic via curl. New Relic returns the source map's unique SOURCEMAP_ID and its components: curl \\ -H \"Api-Key: YOUR_NEW_RELIC_USER_API_KEY\" \\ https://sourcemaps.service.newrelic.com/v2/applications/YOUR_NEW_RELIC_APP_ID/sourcemaps Copy curl: Delete map To delete a source map: Use the GET endpoint to list existing source maps and locate the SOURCEMAP_ID. Run the following command via curl: curl -X DELETE \\ -H \"Api-Key: YOUR_NEW_RELIC_USER_API_KEY\" \\ https://sourcemaps.service.newrelic.com/v2/applications/YOUR_NEW_RELIC_APP_ID/sourcemaps/SOURCEMAP_ID Copy When you're done, go to the JS errors page in browser, select an error grouping, and see if your error stack traces have been un-minified. Troubleshoot source maps If you are having trouble generating source maps from your build system, or if your errors in browser are remaining minified, see the source maps troubleshooting documentation.",

      "body": "You can tailor the Node.js agent to your app's requirements by editing your newrelic.js config file or by setting an environment variable. The config file resides in the root directory of your app. You can also configure a few options from New Relic, or use the Node.js agent API. Important The license_key setting is required. We highly recommend setting the app_name so that your app has a meaningful name instead of the default My Application. Configuration methods and precedence The primary method to configure the Node.js agent is the agent configuration file (newrelic.js). You can also configure most settings with environment variables. You can also adjust some settings with server-side configuration. The Node.js agent uses this order of precedence for configuration methods: Node.js configuration hierarchy: Server-side configuration settings override environment variables. Environment variables override the agent config file. The config file overrides the agent defaults. Here are detailed descriptions of each configuration method: Agent configuration file The config file (newrelic.js) contains every Node.js agent setting. When you install the Node.js agent, you must copy newrelic.js into your app's root directory. Most settings are empty by default; they inherit their values from config/default.js. Environment variables Most configuration settings in newrelic.js have equivalent environment variables. These are useful, for example, if your agent runs in a PaaS environment such as Heroku or Microsoft Azure. Node.js agent environment variables always start with NEW_RELIC_. Where available, these environment variables are documented below under individual config options as the Environ variable. There are also two rarely used settings that can only be configured via environment variables. Server-side configuration Owners and Admins can view and configure a few settings directly in New Relic. Where available, the UI labels for server-side config are listed in this document under individual config options as the Server-side label. Exports variables This section defines the Node.js agent variables in the order they typically appear in the exports.config = { section of your app's newrelic.js configuration file. app_name (REQUIRED) Type String Default \"My Application\" Environ variable NEW_RELIC_APP_NAME The name New Relic uses to identify your app. For example, app_name: ['MyNodeApp']. To use multiple names for your app, specify a comma-delimited list of names. Data for all applications with the same name will be merged in the New Relic UI, so set this carefully. We highly recommend that you replace the default name with a descriptive name to avoid confusion and unintended aggregation of data. Tip For Azure users, the Node.js agent will use APP_POOL_ID if it is set, so you can use the name you chose for your Azure Web Server without setting it twice. license_key (REQUIRED) Type String Default (none) Environ variable NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY This setting is required. Your New Relic license key. For example, license_key: '40HexadecimalCharacters'. agent_enabled Type Boolean Default true Environ variable NEW_RELIC_ENABLED Set to false to stop the agent from starting up. This is useful when debugging your code requires temporarily disabling the agent. It prevents the agent from bootstrapping its instrumentation or setting up all its pieces, which prevents the agent from starting up and connecting to New Relic's servers. allow_all_headers If true, enables capture of all HTTP headers, except for those filtered by exclude rules. If false, collected headers are limited to those defined in Node.js agent attributes. Type Boolean Default false Caution Any header-related include/exclude rules must be in camelCase form to be filtered. apdex_t (DEPRECATED) Type Number Default 0.100 Server-side label Apdex T Set your Apdex T via the New Relic UI. certificates Type Array of strings Default (none) Additional certificates to trust for SSL connections, specified as an array of strings in PEM format. This affects both connections to an HTTPS proxy and connections to New Relic. Tip You can also configure the agent to read its certificates from a file: certificates: [ fs.readFileSync('myca.crt', {encoding: 'utf8'}) ] Copy high_security Type Boolean Default false Environ variable NEW_RELIC_HIGH_SECURITY When set to true, enables high security v2. You must also enable the ssl setting and enable high security in the UI. host Type String Default collector.newrelic.com Environ variable NEW_RELIC_HOST Important Do not edit this value unless New Relic Support asks you to change it. Hostname for the New Relic collector to connect to the Internet; for example, host: 'collector.newrelic.com'. labels Adds tags. Specify your tags as objects or a semicolon-delimited string of colon-separated pairs (for example, Server:One;Data Center:Primary). Type Object or string Default (none) Environ variable NEW_RELIC_LABELS port Type Integer Default 443 Environ variable NEW_RELIC_PORT Important Do not edit this value unless New Relic Support asks you to change it. Port number to connect to the New Relic collector; for example, port: 443. proxy Type String Default (none) Environ variable NEW_RELIC_PROXY_URL A URL specifying the proxy server to connect to the Internet. For example, proxy: 'http://user:pass@10.0.0.1:8000/'. Important The proxy config file setting overrides the other config file proxy settings (proxy_host, proxy_port, proxy_user, proxy_pass) if used. Similarly, the NEW_RELIC_PROXY_URL environment variable overrides the other environment variable proxy settings (NEW_RELIC_PROXY_HOST, NEW_RELIC_PROXY_PORT, NEW_RELIC_PROXY_USER, and NEW_RELIC_PROXY_PASS) if used. proxy_host Type String Default (none) Environ variable NEW_RELIC_PROXY_HOST Hostname or IP address of the proxy server to connect to the Internet. proxy_pass Type String Default (none) Environ variable NEW_RELIC_PROXY_PASS Password for authenticating to the proxy server. The agent supports only basic HTTP authentication. proxy_port Type String Default (none) Environ variable NEW_RELIC_PROXY_PORT Port number of the proxy server to connect to the Internet. proxy_user Type String Default (none) Environ variable NEW_RELIC_PROXY_USER User name for authenticating to the proxy server. The agent supports only basic HTTP authentication. Logging variables This section defines the Node.js agent variables in the order they typically appear in the logging: { section of your app's newrelic.js configuration file. enabled Type String Default true (false in serverless_mode) Environ variable NEW_RELIC_LOG_ENABLED Enables or disables agent specific logging. level Type String Default info Environ variable NEW_RELIC_LOG_LEVEL Defines the level of detail recorded in the agent logs. From least detail to most detail, possible values are fatal, error, warn, info, debug, or trace. Caution Do not use debug or trace logging unless New Relic Support asks you to use them. These levels of logging can generate excessive overhead. For most situations, use info. filepath Type String Default process.cwd() plus newrelic_agent.log Environ variable NEW_RELIC_LOG Complete path to the New Relic agent log, including the filename. Defaults to filepath: require('path').join(process.cwd(), 'newrelic_agent.log'). The agent will shut down the process if it cannot create this file. The agent creates a log file with the same permissions as the parent Node.js agent process. To write all logging to stdout, set this to stdout. To write all logging to stderr, set this to stderr. Audit logging This section defines the Node.js agent variables in the order they typically appear in the audit_log: { section of your app's newrelic.js configuration file. enabled Type Boolean Default false Environ variable NEW_RELIC_AUDIT_LOG_ENABLED When enabled, the agent logs the payloads it sends to the collector. This data is included in the main log file even when logging level is set to the lowest level. endpoints Type Array Default Empty array (include all types) Environ variable NEW_RELIC_AUDIT_LOG_ENDPOINTS The agent sends several different types of data to the collector in separate payloads. By default, all of them are included in the log file. This option makes it possible to limit logging only to specific types of data.

Each configuration option allows you to modularly enable API methods that are responsible for sending custom information to New Relic. Important All of these are set to false when the agent is in high security mode. custom_attributes_enabled Type Boolean Default true Environ variable NEW_RELIC_API_CUSTOM_ATTRIBUTES This option enables newrelic.addCustomAttribute and newrelic.addCustomAttributes. custom_events_enabled Type Boolean Default true Environ variable NEW_RELIC_API_CUSTOM_EVENTS This option enables recordCustomEvent. notice_error_enabled Type Boolean Default true Environ variable NEW_RELIC_API_NOTICE_ERROR This option enables newrelic.noticeError. Attributes This section defines the variables for Node.js agent attributes in the order they typically appear in the attributes: { section of your app's newrelic.js configuration file. Caution Any header-related include/exclude rules must be in camelCase form to be filtered. enabled Type Boolean Default true Environ variable NEW_RELIC_ATTRIBUTES_ENABLED If true, enables capture of attributes for all destinations. exclude Type Array Default [] Environ variable NEW_RELIC_ATTRIBUTES_EXCLUDE Prefix of attributes to exclude from all destinations. Allows * as wildcard at end. include Type Array Default [] Environ variable NEW_RELIC_ATTRIBUTES_INCLUDE Prefix of attributes to include from all destinations. Allows * as wildcard at end. include_enabled Type Boolean Default true Environ variable NEW_RELIC_ATTRIBUTES_INCLUDE_ENABLED When true, patterns may be added to the attributes.include list. Error collector variables You can manage how error are handled in New Relic. This section defines the Node.js agent variables in the order they typically appear in the error_collector: { section of your app's newrelic.js configuration file. enabled Type Boolean Default true Environ variable NEW_RELIC_ERROR_COLLECTOR_ENABLED Server-side label Enable error collection? When enabled, the agent collects error traces from your app. ignore_status_codes Type Array Default 404 Environ variable NEW_RELIC_ERROR_COLLECTOR_IGNORE_ERROR_CODES Server-side label Ignore these status codes Comma-delimited list of HTTP status codes for the error collector to ignore. Caution Errors recorded using newrelic.noticeError do not obey this configuration value. ignore_classes Type Array|Object Default [] Environ variable NEW_RELIC_ERROR_COLLECTOR_IGNORE_ERRORS Comma-delimited list of javascript error types/classes for the error collector to ignore. The following configuration /* ... */ error_collector: { ignore_classes: [\"ReferenceError\"] } /* ... */ Copy Would ignore all reference errors. Caution Errors recorded using newrelic.noticeError do not obey this configuration value. ignore_messages Type Object Default {} A javascript object describing a list of javascript classes tied to javascript error messages for the collector to ignore. The following configuration. /* ... */ error_collector: { /* ... */ ignore_messages: {\"Error\":[\"Undefined\", \"Out of time\"]} /* ... */ } /* ... */ Copy Would ignore all errors of type Error, with the exact (case-sensitive) message strings of Undefined and Out of time. Caution Errors recorded using newrelic.noticeError do not obey this configuration value. expected_status_codes Type Array Default [] Environ variable NEW_RELIC_ERROR_COLLECTOR_EXPECTED_ERROR_CODES Comma-delimited list of HTTP status codes for the error collector to mark as expected. Caution Errors recorded using newrelic.noticeError do not obey this configuration value. expected_classes Type Array Default [] Environ variable NEW_RELIC_ERROR_COLLECTOR_EXPECTED_ERRORS The following configuration /* ... */ error_collector: { expected_classes: [\"ReferenceError\"] } /* ... */ Copy Would mark all reference errors as expected. Caution Errors recorded using newrelic.noticeError do not obey this configuration value. expected_messages Type Object Default {} A javascript object describing a list of javascript classes tied to javascript error messages for the collector to ignore. The following configuration. /* ... */ error_collector: { /* ... */ expected_messages: {\"Error\":[\"Undefined\", \"Out of time\"]} /* ... */ } /* ... */ Copy Would mark all errors of type Error, with the exact (case-sensitive) message strings of Undefined and Out of time. Caution Errors recorded using newrelic.noticeError do not obey this configuration value. attributes.enabled Type Boolean Default true Environ variable NEW_RELIC_ERROR_COLLECTOR_ATTRIBUTES_ENABLED If true, the agent captures attributes from error collection. Caution Any header-related include/exclude rules must be in camelCase form to be filtered. attributes.exclude Type Array Default [] Environ variable NEW_RELIC_ERROR_COLLECTOR_ATTRIBUTES_EXCLUDE Prefix of attributes to exclude from error collection. Allows * as wildcard at end. attributes.include Type Array Default [] Environ variable NEW_RELIC_ERROR_COLLECTOR_ATTRIBUTES_INCLUDE Prefix of attributes to include in error collection. Allows * as wildcard at end. max_event_samples_stored Type Integer Default 100 Environ variable NEW_RELIC_ERROR_COLLECTOR_MAX_EVENT_SAMPLES_STORED Defines the maximum number of events the agent collects per minute. If there are more than this number, the agent collects a statistical sampling. Transaction tracer variables The agent groups your requests into transactions, which are used to: Visualize where your app spends its time (in transaction breakdowns). Identify slow requests. Group metrics. Isolate other issues, such as slow database performance. This section defines the Node.js agent variables in the order they typically appear in the transaction_tracer: { section of your app's newrelic.js configuration file. Important Do not use brackets [suffix] at the end of your transaction name. New Relic automatically strips brackets from the name. Instead, use parentheses (suffix) or other symbols if needed. enabled Type Boolean Default true Environ variable NEW_RELIC_TRACER_ENABLED Server-side label Enable transaction tracing? When enabled, the agent collects slow transaction traces. explain_threshold Type Integer Default 500 Environ variable NEW_RELIC_EXPLAIN_THRESHOLD Minimum query duration (in milliseconds) for a transaction to be eligible for slow queries in transaction traces. record_sql Type String (off, obfuscated, or raw) Default off Environ variable NEW_RELIC_RECORD_SQL This option affects both slow queries and record_sql for transaction traces. It can have one of three values: off, obfuscated, or raw. When set to off no slow queries will be captured, and backtraces and SQL will not be included in transaction traces. If set to raw or obfuscated, the agent sends raw or obfuscated SQL and a slow query sample to the collector. The agent may also send SQL when other criteria are met, such as when slow_sql.enabled is set. top_n Type Integer Default 20 Environ variable NEW_RELIC_TRACER_TOP_N Defines the maximum number of requests eligible for transaction traces. Transactions are named based on the request, and top_n refers to the \"top n slowest transactions\" grouped by these names. The module replaces a recorded trace with a new trace only if the new trace is slower than the previous slowest trace of that name. The default value for this setting is top_n: 20, because the Transactions page also defaults to the 20 slowest transactions. The Node.js agent captures at least five different slow transactions in the first harvest cycle after start up. It will also reset and capture different transactions if no slow transactions have been captured for the last five harvest cycles. This allows you to see more information about more of your app's request paths, at the possible cost of not focusing on the absolutely slowest request for that harvest cycle. Tip To record the absolute slowest transaction over the last minute, you can set top_n: 0 or top_n: 1. However, this causes one very slow route to dominate your transaction traces. transaction_threshold Type Integer or apdex_f Default apdex_f Environ variable NEW_RELIC_TRACER_THRESHOLD Server-side label Threshold Threshold of web transaction response time in seconds beyond which a transaction is eligible for transaction tracing. The default value is apdex_f; this sets the trace threshold to four times your application's Apdex T. You can also enter a specific time value in milliseconds. Example: Threshold set to apdex_f The default apdex_t is 100 milliseconds. If your transaction threshold is set to apdex_f, a \"slow\" transaction is 400 milliseconds. hide_internals Type boolean Default true Environ variable NEW_RELIC_HIDE_INTERNALS The agent uses a small amount of CPU in order to hide internal properties that are attached to the web application. If you change this configuration to false, it may slightly decrease your agent overhead, but it could also have an impact on the performance of the agent. attributes.enabled Type Boolean Default true Environ variable NEW_RELIC_TRANSACTION_TRACER_ATTRIBUTES_ENABLED If true, the agent captures attributes from transaction traces. Caution Any header-related include/exclude rules must be in camelCase form to be filtered. attributes.exclude Type Array Default [] Environ variable NEW_RELIC_TRANSACTION_TRACER_ATTRIBUTES_EXCLUDE Prefix of attributes to exclude from transaction traces. Allows * as wildcard at end. attributes.include Type Array Default [] Environ variable NEW_RELIC_TRANSACTION_TRACER_ATTRIBUTES_INCLUDE Prefix of attributes to include in transaction traces. Allows * as wildcard at end. Rules variables This section defines the Node.js agent variables in the order they typically appear in the rules: { section of your app's newrelic.js configuration file. name Type Strings or regular expressions Default (none) Environ variable NEW_RELIC_NAMING_RULES A comma-delimited list of rules to match incoming request URLs and name the associated New Relic transaction. Uses the format: name: [ {pattern: 'STRING_OR_REGEX', name: 'NAME'}, {pattern: 'STRING_OR_REGEX', name: 'NAME'} ], Copy Both parameters are required. For strings, you must escape control characters. You do not need to escape control characters in regular expressions. Additional attributes are ignored. Regular expressions support JavaScript-style capture groups, and names use $1-style replacement strings. Regular expressions only find the first matching result; subsequent matches are ignored. For more information, see Node.js transaction naming API. For the NEW_RELIC_NAMING_RULES environment variable, pass the rules as comma-delimited JSON object literals: NEW_RELIC_NAMING_RULES='{\"pattern\":\"^t\",\"name\":\"u\"},{\"pattern\":\"^u\",\"name\":\"t\"}' Copy ignore Type Strings or regular expressions Default Regular expression to match socket.io long-polling requests (\"^ \\ /socket \\ .io \\ /. * \\ /xhr-polling/\"). Environ variable NEW_RELIC_IGNORING_RULES Define a list of request URLs you want the agent to ignore. Specify the list as patterns, which can be strings or regular expressions. enforce_backstop Type Boolean Default true Environ variable NEW_RELIC_ENFORCE_BACKSTOP Caution Do not change this setting unless you understand metric grouping issues. When enabled, the agent renames transactions that are not affected by other naming logic (such as the API, rules, or metric normalization rules) to NormalizedUri/*. If you set this to false, the agent sets transaction names to Uri/path/to/resource. Transaction events variables This section defines the Node.js agent variables in the order they typically appear in the transaction_events: { section of your app's newrelic.js configuration file. enabled Type Boolean Default true When enabled, the agent sends transaction events to New Relic. This event data includes transaction timing, transaction name, and any custom parameters. If this is disabled, the agent does not collect this data or send it to New Relic. max_samples_stored Type Integer Default 10000 Environ variable NEW_RELIC_TRANSACTION_EVENTS_MAX_SAMPLES_STORED Defines the maximum number of events the agent collects per minute. If there are more than this number, the agent collects a statistical sampling. We do not recommend configuring past 10,000. The server will cap data at 10,000 per-minute. Important This configuration had different behavior in agent versions lower than 6.0.0. See max_samples_stored (DEPRECATED) for agent versions 5.x or lower. max_samples_stored (DEPRECATED) Type Integer Default 20000 Defines the maximum number of events the agent stores if it is unable to communicate with the New Relic collector. The values from the previous harvest cycle will be merged into the next one, with this option limiting the maximum number. Make sure this number is greater than max_samples_per_minute; for example, set it to twice as much. Consider your memory overhead before increasing this value. Caution This configuration has different behavior starting with agent version 6.0.0 and a new recommended maximum. See max_samples_stored for agent versions 6.x or higher. max_samples_per_minute (DEPRECATED) Type Integer Default 10000 Defines the maximum number of events the agent collects per minute. If there are more than this number, the agent collects a statistical sampling. Caution This configuration has been replaced with max_samples_stored starting with version 6.0.0 of the agent. See max_samples_stored for 6.x or later agents. attributes.enabled Type Boolean Default true Environ variable NEW_RELIC_TRANSACTION_EVENTS_ATTRIBUTES_ENABLED If true, the agent captures attributes from transaction events. Caution Any header-related include/exclude rules must be in camelCase form to be filtered. attributes.exclude Type Array Default [] Environ variable NEW_RELIC_TRANSACTION_EVENTS_ATTRIBUTES_EXCLUDE Prefix of attributes to exclude from transaction events. Allows * as wildcard at end. attributes.include Type Array Default [] Environ variable NEW_RELIC_TRANSACTION_EVENTS_ATTRIBUTES_INCLUDE Prefix of attributes to include in transaction events. Allows * as wildcard at end. Browser monitoring variables This section defines the Node.js agent variables in the order they typically appear in the browser_monitoring: { section of your app's newrelic.js configuration file. enable Type Boolean Default true Environ variable NEW_RELIC_BROWSER_MONITOR_ENABLE Server-side label Enable browser monitoring? Generate JavaScript headers for browser instrumentation. Although this defaults to true, the agent doesn't inject the browser JS code unless you have enabled browser monitoring. Even if you have enabled it and added the browser timing header, you can disable browser monitoring for your app by setting this to false. debug Type Boolean Default false Environ variable NEW_RELIC_BROWSER_MONITOR_DEBUG If true, request un-minified sources from the server. attributes.enabled Type Boolean Default false Environ variable NEW_RELIC_BROWSER_MONITORING_ATTRIBUTES_ENABLED If true, the agent sends custom attributes to browser monitoring. Caution Any header-related include/exclude rules must be in camelCase form to be filtered. attributes.exclude Type Array Default [] Environ variable NEW_RELIC_BROWSER_MONITORING_ATTRIBUTES_EXCLUDE Prefix of attributes to exclude from browser monitoring. Allows * as wildcard at end. attributes.include Type Array Default [] Environ variable NEW_RELIC_BROWSER_MONITORING_ATTRIBUTES_INCLUDE Prefix of attributes to include in browser monitoring. Allows * as wildcard at end. Custom events variables This section defines the Node.js agent variables in the order they typically appear in the custom_insights_events: { section of your app's newrelic.js configuration file. Currently there are no environment variables for custom events. enabled Type Boolean Default true When enabled, the agent sends custom events recorded with recordCustomEvent() to New Relic. If this is disabled, the agent does not collect this data or send it to New Relic. max_samples_stored Type Integer Default 1000 Environ variable NEW_RELIC_CUSTOM_INSIGHTS_EVENTS_MAX_SAMPLES_STORED Defines the maximum number of custom events the agent collects per minute. If the number of custom events exceeds this limit, the agent collects a statistical sampling. Important Increasing this limit increases memory usage. Slow queries variables This section defines the Node.js agent variables in the order they typically appear in the slow_sql: { section of your app's newrelic.js configuration file. These options control behavior for slow queries, but do not affect SQL nodes in transaction traces. enabled Type Boolean Default false Environ variable NEW_RELIC_SLOW_SQL_ENABLED When enabled, the agent collects slow query details. max_samples Type Integer Default 10 Environ variable NEW_RELIC_MAX_SQL_SAMPLES Defines the maximum number of slow queries the agent collects per minute. The agent discards additional queries after the limit is reached. Important Increasing this limit increases memory usage. Custom hostname variables This section defines the Node.js agent variables in the order they typically appear in the process_host: { section of your app's newrelic.js configuration file. These options control behavior regarding the host display name in the APM UI. display_name Type String of 255 bytes or less Default (none) Environ variable NEW_RELIC_PROCESS_HOST_DISPLAY_NAME Specify a custom hostname for display in New Relic. If you do not set this field, New Relic will continue to use the default hostname found by calling os.hostname(). If you use the default hostname settings, New Relic finds the hostname through os.hostname(). If this call fails, New Relic uses the host's IP as the name. If you set ipv_preference: 4 or ipv_preference: 6, you can select the type of IP address (IPv4 or IPv6) that appears in the New Relic UI. ipv_preference Type Integer (4 or 6) Default 4 Environ variable NEW_RELIC_IPV_PREFERENCE Environment variable overrides This section defines two configuration options only available with environment variables. These overrides are not used in most configurations. NEW_RELIC_HOME Path to the directory containing newrelic.js. This is available only as an environment variable. You cannot set it in your config file. Type String Default (none) NEW_RELIC_NO_CONFIG_FILE If used, this prevents the agent from reading configuration settings from newrelic.js. Default values and values from environment variables will still be set. This is available only as an environment variable. You cannot set it in your config file. Type Boolean Default False Datastore tracer variables This section defines the Node.js agent variables in the order they typically appear in the datastore_tracer section of your app's newrelic.js configuration file. These options control behavior for collecting datastore instance metrics. instance_reporting.enabled Type Boolean Default true When enabled, the agent collects datastore instance metrics (such as host and port) for some database drivers. These are reported on slow query traces and transaction traces. database_name_reporting.enabled Type Boolean Default true When enabled, the agent collects database name on slow query traces and transaction traces for some database drivers. Cross application tracing (DEPRECATED) The Node.js agent variables that control cross application tracing typically appear in the cross_application_tracer section of your app's newrelic.js configuration file: enabled Type Boolean Default false When set to true, allows tracing of transactions across more than one New Relic-monitored applications. Important Cross application tracing (CAT) has been deprecated and will be removed in a future major release. For cross-service visibility, we recommend using distributed tracing, which is enabled by default as of agent version 8.3.0. Before enabling, read the transition guide. Error message redaction variables The Node.js agent variables that control error message redaction appear in the allow_raw_exception_messages section of your app's newrelic.js configuration file: enabled Type Boolean Default true Environ variable NEW_RELIC_ALLOW_RAW_EXCEPTION_MESSAGES_ENABLED When false, the agent will redact the messages of captured errors. Distributed tracing Important Enabling distributed tracing disables cross application tracing, and has effects on other APM features. Before enabling, read the transition guide. Requires Node.js agent version 4.7.0 or higher. Distributed tracing lets you see the path that a request takes as it travels through a distributed system. When configuring via the config file, place the following option in the distributed_tracing section. enabled Type Boolean Default true Environ variable NEW_RELIC_DISTRIBUTED_TRACING_ENABLED Set this to true to enable distributed tracing. For example, to enable this in the config file, you would use: distributed_tracing: { enabled: true } Copy exclude_newrelic_header Type Boolean Default false Set this to true to exclude the New Relic header that is attached to outbound requests, and instead only rely on W3C Trace Context Headers for distributed tracing. If this is false then both types of headers are used. For example, to enable this in the config file, you would use: distributed_tracing:{ enabled: true, exclude_newrelic_header: true } Copy Span events Span data is reported for distributed tracing. Distributed tracing must be enabled to report spans. Span configuration is set in the span_events stanza. Options include: enabled Type Boolean Default true Environ variable NEW_RELIC_SPAN_EVENTS_ENABLED Turns reporting of span events on or off. attributes.enabled Type Boolean Default true Environ variable NEW_RELIC_SPAN_EVENTS_ATTRIBUTES_ENABLED This setting can be used to turn reporting of attributes on or off for spans. If attributes.enabled at the root level is false, no attributes will be sent with spans regardless on how this is set. attributes.include Type Array Default [] Environ variable NEW_RELIC_SPAN_EVENTS_ATTRIBUTES_INCLUDE If attributes are enabled for spans, all attribute keys found in this list will be attached to spans. For more information, see the agent attribute rules. attributes.exclude Type Array Default [] Environ variable NEW_RELIC_SPAN_EVENTS_ATTRIBUTES_EXCLUDE All attribute keys found in this list will not be sent with spans. For more information, see the agent attribute rules. max_samples_stored Type Integer Default 2000 Environ variable NEW_RELIC_SPAN_EVENTS_MAX_SAMPLES_STORED Defines the maximum number of events the agent collects per minute. If there are more than this number, the agent collects a statistical sampling. We do not recommend configuring past 10k. The server will cap data at 10k per-minute. Infinite Tracing To turn on Infinite Tracing, enable distributed tracing (set distributed_tracing to enabled: true) and add the additional settings below. For an example, see Language agents: configure distributed tracing. trace_observer.host Type String Default (none) Environ variable NEW_RELIC_INFINITE_TRACING_TRACE_OBSERVER_HOST For help getting a valid Infinite Tracing trace observer host entry, see Find or create a trace observer endpoint.",

      "body": "You can tailor the Node.js agent to your app's requirements by editing your newrelic.js config file or by setting an environment variable. The config file resides in the root directory of your app. You can also configure a few options from New Relic, or use the Node.js agent API. Important The license_key setting is required. We highly recommend setting the app_name so that your app has a meaningful name instead of the default My Application. Configuration methods and precedence The primary method to configure the Node.js agent is the agent configuration file (newrelic.js). You can also configure most settings with environment variables. You can also adjust some settings with server-side configuration. The Node.js agent uses this order of precedence for configuration methods: Node.js configuration hierarchy: Server-side configuration settings override environment variables. Environment variables override the agent config file. The config file overrides the agent defaults. Here are detailed descriptions of each configuration method: Agent configuration file The config file (newrelic.js) contains every Node.js agent setting. When you install the Node.js agent, you must copy newrelic.js into your app's root directory. Most settings are empty by default; they inherit their values from config/default.js. Environment variables Most configuration settings in newrelic.js have equivalent environment variables. These are useful, for example, if your agent runs in a PaaS environment such as Heroku or Microsoft Azure. Node.js agent environment variables always start with NEW_RELIC_. Where available, these environment variables are documented below under individual config options as the Environ variable. There are also two rarely used settings that can only be configured via environment variables. Server-side configuration Owners and Admins can view and configure a few settings directly in New Relic. Where available, the UI labels for server-side config are listed in this document under individual config options as the Server-side label. Exports variables This section defines the Node.js agent variables in the order they typically appear in the exports.config = { section of your app's newrelic.js configuration file. app_name (REQUIRED) Type String Default \"My Application\" Environ variable NEW_RELIC_APP_NAME The name New Relic uses to identify your app. For example, app_name: ['MyNodeApp']. To use multiple names for your app, specify a comma-delimited list of names. Data for all applications with the same name will be merged in the New Relic UI, so set this carefully. We highly recommend that you replace the default name with a descriptive name to avoid confusion and unintended aggregation of data. Tip For Azure users, the Node.js agent will use APP_POOL_ID if it is set, so you can use the name you chose for your Azure Web Server without setting it twice. license_key (REQUIRED) Type String Default (none) Environ variable NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY This setting is required. Your New Relic license key. For example, license_key: '40HexadecimalCharacters'. agent_enabled Type Boolean Default true Environ variable NEW_RELIC_ENABLED Set to false to stop the agent from starting up. This is useful when debugging your code requires temporarily disabling the agent. It prevents the agent from bootstrapping its instrumentation or setting up all its pieces, which prevents the agent from starting up and connecting to New Relic's servers. allow_all_headers If true, enables capture of all HTTP headers, except for those filtered by exclude rules. If false, collected headers are limited to those defined in Node.js agent attributes. Type Boolean Default false Caution Any header-related include/exclude rules must be in camelCase form to be filtered. apdex_t (DEPRECATED) Type Number Default 0.100 Server-side label Apdex T Set your Apdex T via the New Relic UI. certificates Type Array of strings Default (none) Additional certificates to trust for SSL connections, specified as an array of strings in PEM format. This affects both connections to an HTTPS proxy and connections to New Relic. Tip You can also configure the agent to read its certificates from a file: certificates: [ fs.readFileSync('myca.crt', {encoding: 'utf8'}) ] Copy high_security Type Boolean Default false Environ variable NEW_RELIC_HIGH_SECURITY When set to true, enables high security v2. You must also enable the ssl setting and enable high security in the UI. host Type String Default collector.newrelic.com Environ variable NEW_RELIC_HOST Important Do not edit this value unless New Relic Support asks you to change it. Hostname for the New Relic collector to connect to the Internet; for example, host: 'collector.newrelic.com'. labels Adds tags. Specify your tags as objects or a semicolon-delimited string of colon-separated pairs (for example, Server:One;Data Center:Primary). Type Object or string Default (none) Environ variable NEW_RELIC_LABELS port Type Integer Default 443 Environ variable NEW_RELIC_PORT Important Do not edit this value unless New Relic Support asks you to change it. Port number to connect to the New Relic collector; for example, port: 443. proxy Type String Default (none) Environ variable NEW_RELIC_PROXY_URL A URL specifying the proxy server to connect to the Internet. For example, proxy: 'http://user:pass@10.0.0.1:8000/'. Important The proxy config file setting overrides the other config file proxy settings (proxy_host, proxy_port, proxy_user, proxy_pass) if used. Similarly, the NEW_RELIC_PROXY_URL environment variable overrides the other environment variable proxy settings (NEW_RELIC_PROXY_HOST, NEW_RELIC_PROXY_PORT, NEW_RELIC_PROXY_USER, and NEW_RELIC_PROXY_PASS) if used. proxy_host Type String Default (none) Environ variable NEW_RELIC_PROXY_HOST Hostname or IP address of the proxy server to connect to the Internet. proxy_pass Type String Default (none) Environ variable NEW_RELIC_PROXY_PASS Password for authenticating to the proxy server. The agent supports only basic HTTP authentication. proxy_port Type String Default (none) Environ variable NEW_RELIC_PROXY_PORT Port number of the proxy server to connect to the Internet. proxy_user Type String Default (none) Environ variable NEW_RELIC_PROXY_USER User name for authenticating to the proxy server. The agent supports only basic HTTP authentication. Logging variables This section defines the Node.js agent variables in the order they typically appear in the logging: { section of your app's newrelic.js configuration file. enabled Type String Default true (false in serverless_mode) Environ variable NEW_RELIC_LOG_ENABLED Enables or disables agent specific logging. level Type String Default info Environ variable NEW_RELIC_LOG_LEVEL Defines the level of detail recorded in the agent logs. From least detail to most detail, possible values are fatal, error, warn, info, debug, or trace. Caution Do not use debug or trace logging unless New Relic Support asks you to use them. These levels of logging can generate excessive overhead. For most situations, use info. filepath Type String Default process.cwd() plus newrelic_agent.log Environ variable NEW_RELIC_LOG Complete path to the New Relic agent log, including the filename. Defaults to filepath: require('path').join(process.cwd(), 'newrelic_agent.log'). The agent will shut down the process if it cannot create this file. The agent creates a log file with the same permissions as the parent Node.js agent process. To write all logging to stdout, set this to stdout. To write all logging to stderr, set this to stderr. Audit logging This section defines the Node.js agent variables in the order they typically appear in the audit_log: { section of your app's newrelic.js configuration file. enabled Type Boolean Default false Environ variable NEW_RELIC_AUDIT_LOG_ENABLED When enabled, the agent logs the payloads it sends to the collector. This data is included in the main log file even when logging level is set to the lowest level. endpoints Type Array Default Empty array (include all types) Environ variable NEW_RELIC_AUDIT_LOG_ENDPOINTS The agent sends several different types of data to the collector in separate payloads. By default, all of them are included in the log file. This option makes it possible to limit logging only to specific types of data. Valid values include: agent_settings analytic_event_data connect custom_event_data error_data error_event_data metric_data preconnect shutdown span_event_data sql_trace_data transaction_sample_data API configuration This section allows you to choose which API methods are enabled. Each configuration option allows you to modularly enable API methods that are responsible for sending custom information to New Relic. Important All of these are set to false when the agent is in high security mode. custom_attributes_enabled Type Boolean Default true Environ variable NEW_RELIC_API_CUSTOM_ATTRIBUTES This option enables newrelic.addCustomAttribute and newrelic.addCustomAttributes. custom_events_enabled Type Boolean Default true Environ variable NEW_RELIC_API_CUSTOM_EVENTS This option enables recordCustomEvent. notice_error_enabled Type Boolean Default true Environ variable NEW_RELIC_API_NOTICE_ERROR This option enables newrelic.noticeError. Attributes This section defines the variables for Node.js agent attributes in the order they typically appear in the attributes: { section of your app's newrelic.js configuration file. Caution Any header-related include/exclude rules must be in camelCase form to be filtered. enabled Type Boolean Default true Environ variable NEW_RELIC_ATTRIBUTES_ENABLED If true, enables capture of attributes for all destinations. exclude Type Array Default [] Environ variable NEW_RELIC_ATTRIBUTES_EXCLUDE Prefix of attributes to exclude from all destinations. Allows * as wildcard at end. include Type Array Default [] Environ variable NEW_RELIC_ATTRIBUTES_INCLUDE Prefix of attributes to include from all destinations. Allows * as wildcard at end. include_enabled Type Boolean Default true Environ variable NEW_RELIC_ATTRIBUTES_INCLUDE_ENABLED When true, patterns may be added to the attributes.include list. Error collector variables You can manage how error are handled in New Relic. This section defines the Node.js agent variables in the order they typically appear in the error_collector: { section of your app's newrelic.js configuration file. enabled Type Boolean Default true Environ variable NEW_RELIC_ERROR_COLLECTOR_ENABLED Server-side label Enable error collection? When enabled, the agent collects error traces from your app. ignore_status_codes Type Array Default 404 Environ variable NEW_RELIC_ERROR_COLLECTOR_IGNORE_ERROR_CODES Server-side label Ignore these status codes Comma-delimited list of HTTP status codes for the error collector to ignore. Caution Errors recorded using newrelic.noticeError do not obey this configuration value. ignore_classes Type Array|Object Default [] Environ variable NEW_RELIC_ERROR_COLLECTOR_IGNORE_ERRORS Comma-delimited list of javascript error types/classes for the error collector to ignore. The following configuration /* ... */ error_collector: { ignore_classes: [\"ReferenceError\"] } /* ... */ Copy Would ignore all reference errors. Caution Errors recorded using newrelic.noticeError do not obey this configuration value. ignore_messages Type Object Default {} A javascript object describing a list of javascript classes tied to javascript error messages for the collector to ignore. The following configuration. /* ... */ error_collector: { /* ... */ ignore_messages: {\"Error\":[\"Undefined\", \"Out of time\"]} /* ... */ } /* ... */ Copy Would ignore all errors of type Error, with the exact (case-sensitive) message strings of Undefined and Out of time. Caution Errors recorded using newrelic.noticeError do not obey this configuration value. expected_status_codes Type Array Default [] Environ variable NEW_RELIC_ERROR_COLLECTOR_EXPECTED_ERROR_CODES Comma-delimited list of HTTP status codes for the error collector to mark as expected. Caution Errors recorded using newrelic.noticeError do not obey this configuration value. expected_classes Type Array Default [] Environ variable NEW_RELIC_ERROR_COLLECTOR_EXPECTED_ERRORS The following configuration /* ... */ error_collector: { expected_classes: [\"ReferenceError\"] } /* ... */ Copy Would mark all reference errors as expected. Caution Errors recorded using newrelic.noticeError do not obey this configuration value. expected_messages Type Object Default {} A javascript object describing a list of javascript classes tied to javascript error messages for the collector to ignore. The following configuration. /* ... */ error_collector: { /* ... */ expected_messages: {\"Error\":[\"Undefined\", \"Out of time\"]} /* ... */ } /* ... */ Copy Would mark all errors of type Error, with the exact (case-sensitive) message strings of Undefined and Out of time. Caution Errors recorded using newrelic.noticeError do not obey this configuration value. attributes.enabled Type Boolean Default true Environ variable NEW_RELIC_ERROR_COLLECTOR_ATTRIBUTES_ENABLED If true, the agent captures attributes from error collection. Caution Any header-related include/exclude rules must be in camelCase form to be filtered. attributes.exclude Type Array Default [] Environ variable NEW_RELIC_ERROR_COLLECTOR_ATTRIBUTES_EXCLUDE Prefix of attributes to exclude from error collection. Allows * as wildcard at end. attributes.include Type Array Default [] Environ variable NEW_RELIC_ERROR_COLLECTOR_ATTRIBUTES_INCLUDE Prefix of attributes to include in error collection. Allows * as wildcard at end. max_event_samples_stored Type Integer Default 100 Environ variable NEW_RELIC_ERROR_COLLECTOR_MAX_EVENT_SAMPLES_STORED Defines the maximum number of events the agent collects per minute. If there are more than this number, the agent collects a statistical sampling. Transaction tracer variables The agent groups your requests into transactions, which are used to: Visualize where your app spends its time (in transaction breakdowns). Identify slow requests. Group metrics. Isolate other issues, such as slow database performance. This section defines the Node.js agent variables in the order they typically appear in the transaction_tracer: { section of your app's newrelic.js configuration file. Important Do not use brackets [suffix] at the end of your transaction name. New Relic automatically strips brackets from the name. Instead, use parentheses (suffix) or other symbols if needed. enabled Type Boolean Default true Environ variable NEW_RELIC_TRACER_ENABLED Server-side label Enable transaction tracing? When enabled, the agent collects slow transaction traces. explain_threshold Type Integer Default 500 Environ variable NEW_RELIC_EXPLAIN_THRESHOLD Minimum query duration (in milliseconds) for a transaction to be eligible for slow queries in transaction traces. record_sql Type String (off, obfuscated, or raw) Default off Environ variable NEW_RELIC_RECORD_SQL This option affects both slow queries and record_sql for transaction traces. It can have one of three values: off, obfuscated, or raw. When set to off no slow queries will be captured, and backtraces and SQL will not be included in transaction traces. If set to raw or obfuscated, the agent sends raw or obfuscated SQL and a slow query sample to the collector. The agent may also send SQL when other criteria are met, such as when slow_sql.enabled is set. top_n Type Integer Default 20 Environ variable NEW_RELIC_TRACER_TOP_N Defines the maximum number of requests eligible for transaction traces. Transactions are named based on the request, and top_n refers to the \"top n slowest transactions\" grouped by these names. The module replaces a recorded trace with a new trace only if the new trace is slower than the previous slowest trace of that name. The default value for this setting is top_n: 20, because the Transactions page also defaults to the 20 slowest transactions. The Node.js agent captures at least five different slow transactions in the first harvest cycle after start up. It will also reset and capture different transactions if no slow transactions have been captured for the last five harvest cycles. This allows you to see more information about more of your app's request paths, at the possible cost of not focusing on the absolutely slowest request for that harvest cycle. Tip To record the absolute slowest transaction over the last minute, you can set top_n: 0 or top_n: 1. However, this causes one very slow route to dominate your transaction traces. transaction_threshold Type Integer or apdex_f Default apdex_f Environ variable NEW_RELIC_TRACER_THRESHOLD Server-side label Threshold Threshold of web transaction response time in seconds beyond which a transaction is eligible for transaction tracing. The default value is apdex_f; this sets the trace threshold to four times your application's Apdex T. You can also enter a specific time value in milliseconds. Example: Threshold set to apdex_f The default apdex_t is 100 milliseconds. If your transaction threshold is set to apdex_f, a \"slow\" transaction is 400 milliseconds. hide_internals Type boolean Default true Environ variable NEW_RELIC_HIDE_INTERNALS The agent uses a small amount of CPU in order to hide internal properties that are attached to the web application. If you change this configuration to false, it may slightly decrease your agent overhead, but it could also have an impact on the performance of the agent. attributes.enabled Type Boolean Default true Environ variable NEW_RELIC_TRANSACTION_TRACER_ATTRIBUTES_ENABLED If true, the agent captures attributes from transaction traces. Caution Any header-related include/exclude rules must be in camelCase form to be filtered. attributes.exclude Type Array Default [] Environ variable NEW_RELIC_TRANSACTION_TRACER_ATTRIBUTES_EXCLUDE Prefix of attributes to exclude from transaction traces. Allows * as wildcard at end. attributes.include Type Array Default [] Environ variable NEW_RELIC_TRANSACTION_TRACER_ATTRIBUTES_INCLUDE Prefix of attributes to include in transaction traces. Allows * as wildcard at end. Rules variables This section defines the Node.js agent variables in the order they typically appear in the rules: { section of your app's newrelic.js configuration file. name Type Strings or regular expressions Default (none) Environ variable NEW_RELIC_NAMING_RULES A comma-delimited list of rules to match incoming request URLs and name the associated New Relic transaction. Uses the format: name: [ {pattern: 'STRING_OR_REGEX', name: 'NAME'}, {pattern: 'STRING_OR_REGEX', name: 'NAME'} ], Copy Both parameters are required. For strings, you must escape control characters. You do not need to escape control characters in regular expressions. Additional attributes are ignored. Regular expressions support JavaScript-style capture groups, and names use $1-style replacement strings. Regular expressions only find the first matching result; subsequent matches are ignored. For more information, see Node.js transaction naming API. For the NEW_RELIC_NAMING_RULES environment variable, pass the rules as comma-delimited JSON object literals: NEW_RELIC_NAMING_RULES='{\"pattern\":\"^t\",\"name\":\"u\"},{\"pattern\":\"^u\",\"name\":\"t\"}' Copy ignore Type Strings or regular expressions Default Regular expression to match socket.io long-polling requests (\"^ \\ /socket \\ .io \\ /. * \\ /xhr-polling/\"). Environ variable NEW_RELIC_IGNORING_RULES Define a list of request URLs you want the agent to ignore. Specify the list as patterns, which can be strings or regular expressions. enforce_backstop Type Boolean Default true Environ variable NEW_RELIC_ENFORCE_BACKSTOP Caution Do not change this setting unless you understand metric grouping issues. When enabled, the agent renames transactions that are not affected by other naming logic (such as the API, rules, or metric normalization rules) to NormalizedUri/*. If you set this to false, the agent sets transaction names to Uri/path/to/resource. Transaction events variables This section defines the Node.js agent variables in the order they typically appear in the transaction_events: { section of your app's newrelic.js configuration file. enabled Type Boolean Default true When enabled, the agent sends transaction events to New Relic. This event data includes transaction timing, transaction name, and any custom parameters. If this is disabled, the agent does not collect this data or send it to New Relic. max_samples_stored Type Integer Default 10000 Environ variable NEW_RELIC_TRANSACTION_EVENTS_MAX_SAMPLES_STORED Defines the maximum number of events the agent collects per minute. If there are more than this number, the agent collects a statistical sampling. We do not recommend configuring past 10,000. The server will cap data at 10,000 per-minute. Important This configuration had different behavior in agent versions lower than 6.0.0. See max_samples_stored (DEPRECATED) for agent versions 5.x or lower. max_samples_stored (DEPRECATED) Type Integer Default 20000 Defines the maximum number of events the agent stores if it is unable to communicate with the New Relic collector. The values from the previous harvest cycle will be merged into the next one, with this option limiting the maximum number. Make sure this number is greater than max_samples_per_minute; for example, set it to twice as much. Consider your memory overhead before increasing this value. Caution This configuration has different behavior starting with agent version 6.0.0 and a new recommended maximum. See max_samples_stored for agent versions 6.x or higher. max_samples_per_minute (DEPRECATED) Type Integer Default 10000 Defines the maximum number of events the agent collects per minute. If there are more than this number, the agent collects a statistical sampling. Caution This configuration has been replaced with max_samples_stored starting with version 6.0.0 of the agent. See max_samples_stored for 6.x or later agents. attributes.enabled Type Boolean Default true Environ variable NEW_RELIC_TRANSACTION_EVENTS_ATTRIBUTES_ENABLED If true, the agent captures attributes from transaction events. Caution Any header-related include/exclude rules must be in camelCase form to be filtered. attributes.exclude Type Array Default [] Environ variable NEW_RELIC_TRANSACTION_EVENTS_ATTRIBUTES_EXCLUDE Prefix of attributes to exclude from transaction events. Allows * as wildcard at end. attributes.include Type Array Default [] Environ variable NEW_RELIC_TRANSACTION_EVENTS_ATTRIBUTES_INCLUDE Prefix of attributes to include in transaction events. Allows * as wildcard at end. Browser monitoring variables This section defines the Node.js agent variables in the order they typically appear in the browser_monitoring: { section of your app's newrelic.js configuration file. enable Type Boolean Default true Environ variable NEW_RELIC_BROWSER_MONITOR_ENABLE Server-side label Enable browser monitoring? Generate JavaScript headers for browser instrumentation. Although this defaults to true, the agent doesn't inject the browser JS code unless you have enabled browser monitoring. Even if you have enabled it and added the browser timing header, you can disable browser monitoring for your app by setting this to false. debug Type Boolean Default false Environ variable NEW_RELIC_BROWSER_MONITOR_DEBUG If true, request un-minified sources from the server. attributes.enabled Type Boolean Default false Environ variable NEW_RELIC_BROWSER_MONITORING_ATTRIBUTES_ENABLED If true, the agent sends custom attributes to browser monitoring. Caution Any header-related include/exclude rules must be in camelCase form to be filtered. attributes.exclude Type Array Default [] Environ variable NEW_RELIC_BROWSER_MONITORING_ATTRIBUTES_EXCLUDE Prefix of attributes to exclude from browser monitoring. Allows * as wildcard at end. attributes.include Type Array Default [] Environ variable NEW_RELIC_BROWSER_MONITORING_ATTRIBUTES_INCLUDE Prefix of attributes to include in browser monitoring. Allows * as wildcard at end. Custom events variables This section defines the Node.js agent variables in the order they typically appear in the custom_insights_events: { section of your app's newrelic.js configuration file. Currently there are no environment variables for custom events. enabled Type Boolean Default true When enabled, the agent sends custom events recorded with recordCustomEvent() to New Relic. If this is disabled, the agent does not collect this data or send it to New Relic. max_samples_stored Type Integer Default 1000 Environ variable NEW_RELIC_CUSTOM_INSIGHTS_EVENTS_MAX_SAMPLES_STORED Defines the maximum number of custom events the agent collects per minute. If the number of custom events exceeds this limit, the agent collects a statistical sampling. Important Increasing this limit increases memory usage. Slow queries variables This section defines the Node.js agent variables in the order they typically appear in the slow_sql: { section of your app's newrelic.js configuration file. These options control behavior for slow queries, but do not affect SQL nodes in transaction traces. enabled Type Boolean Default false Environ variable NEW_RELIC_SLOW_SQL_ENABLED When enabled, the agent collects slow query details. max_samples Type Integer Default 10 Environ variable NEW_RELIC_MAX_SQL_SAMPLES Defines the maximum number of slow queries the agent collects per minute. The agent discards additional queries after the limit is reached. Important Increasing this limit increases memory usage. Custom hostname variables This section defines the Node.js agent variables in the order they typically appear in the process_host: { section of your app's newrelic.js configuration file. These options control behavior regarding the host display name in the APM UI. display_name Type String of 255 bytes or less Default (none) Environ variable NEW_RELIC_PROCESS_HOST_DISPLAY_NAME Specify a custom hostname for display in New Relic. If you do not set this field, New Relic will continue to use the default hostname found by calling os.hostname(). If you use the default hostname settings, New Relic finds the hostname through os.hostname(). If this call fails, New Relic uses the host's IP as the name. If you set ipv_preference: 4 or ipv_preference: 6, you can select the type of IP address (IPv4 or IPv6) that appears in the New Relic UI. ipv_preference Type Integer (4 or 6) Default 4 Environ variable NEW_RELIC_IPV_PREFERENCE Environment variable overrides This section defines two configuration options only available with environment variables. These overrides are not used in most configurations. NEW_RELIC_HOME Path to the directory containing newrelic.js. This is available only as an environment variable. You cannot set it in your config file. Type String Default (none) NEW_RELIC_NO_CONFIG_FILE If used, this prevents the agent from reading configuration settings from newrelic.js. Default values and values from environment variables will still be set. This is available only as an environment variable. You cannot set it in your config file. Type Boolean Default False Datastore tracer variables This section defines the Node.js agent variables in the order they typically appear in the datastore_tracer section of your app's newrelic.js configuration file. These options control behavior for collecting datastore instance metrics. instance_reporting.enabled Type Boolean Default true When enabled, the agent collects datastore instance metrics (such as host and port) for some database drivers. These are reported on slow query traces and transaction traces. database_name_reporting.enabled Type Boolean Default true When enabled, the agent collects database name on slow query traces and transaction traces for some database drivers. Cross application tracing (DEPRECATED) The Node.js agent variables that control cross application tracing typically appear in the cross_application_tracer section of your app's newrelic.js configuration file: enabled Type Boolean Default false When set to true, allows tracing of transactions across more than one New Relic-monitored applications. Important Cross application tracing (CAT) has been deprecated and will be removed in a future major release. For cross-service visibility, we recommend using distributed tracing, which is enabled by default as of agent version 8.3.0. Before enabling, read the transition guide. Error message redaction variables The Node.js agent variables that control error message redaction appear in the allow_raw_exception_messages section of your app's newrelic.js configuration file: enabled Type Boolean Default true Environ variable NEW_RELIC_ALLOW_RAW_EXCEPTION_MESSAGES_ENABLED When false, the agent will redact the messages of captured errors. Distributed tracing Important Enabling distributed tracing disables cross application tracing, and has effects on other APM features. Before enabling, read the transition guide. Requires Node.js agent version 4.7.0 or higher. Distributed tracing lets you see the path that a request takes as it travels through a distributed system. When configuring via the config file, place the following option in the distributed_tracing section. enabled Type Boolean Default true Environ variable NEW_RELIC_DISTRIBUTED_TRACING_ENABLED Set this to true to enable distributed tracing. For example, to enable this in the config file, you would use: distributed_tracing: { enabled: true } Copy exclude_newrelic_header Type Boolean Default false Set this to true to exclude the New Relic header that is attached to outbound requests, and instead only rely on W3C Trace Context Headers for distributed tracing. If this is false then both types of headers are used. For example, to enable this in the config file, you would use: distributed_tracing:{ enabled: true, exclude_newrelic_header: true } Copy Span events Span data is reported for distributed tracing. Distributed tracing must be enabled to report spans. Span configuration is set in the span_events stanza. Options include: enabled Type Boolean Default true Environ variable NEW_RELIC_SPAN_EVENTS_ENABLED Turns reporting of span events on or off. attributes.enabled Type Boolean Default true Environ variable NEW_RELIC_SPAN_EVENTS_ATTRIBUTES_ENABLED This setting can be used to turn reporting of attributes on or off for spans. If attributes.enabled at the root level is false, no attributes will be sent with spans regardless on how this is set. attributes.include Type Array Default [] Environ variable NEW_RELIC_SPAN_EVENTS_ATTRIBUTES_INCLUDE If attributes are enabled for spans, all attribute keys found in this list will be attached to spans. For more information, see the agent attribute rules. attributes.exclude Type Array Default [] Environ variable NEW_RELIC_SPAN_EVENTS_ATTRIBUTES_EXCLUDE All attribute keys found in this list will not be sent with spans. For more information, see the agent attribute rules. max_samples_stored Type Integer Default 2000 Environ variable NEW_RELIC_SPAN_EVENTS_MAX_SAMPLES_STORED Defines the maximum number of events the agent collects per minute. If there are more than this number, the agent collects a statistical sampling. We do not recommend configuring past 10k. The server will cap data at 10k per-minute. Infinite Tracing To turn on Infinite Tracing, enable distributed tracing (set distributed_tracing to enabled: true) and add the additional settings below. For an example, see Language agents: configure distributed tracing. trace_observer.host Type String Default (none) Environ variable NEW_RELIC_INFINITE_TRACING_TRACE_OBSERVER_HOST For help getting a valid Infinite Tracing trace observer host entry, see Find or create a trace observer endpoint.",

      "body": "Follow the appropriate procedure to rename your browser app depending on the deployment option you used to add it to browser. Rename app monitored by APM If you added an app to browser already being monitored by APM, the app name that appears in browser is the same as the app name in the APM UI. To rename the app, use any of these options: Option Comments Rename and continue collecting data This option is useful when you simply want to give an app a different display name (alias). To change the alias that appears in the New Relic UI, use the app's Settings page: Go to one.newrelic.com > APM > (select an app) > Settings > Application. Stop reporting under the old name To stop reporting data under the old name and begin collecting data with a new name (app identifer), use the APM agent's configuration file. This changes the identifier that New Relic's data collector uses to distinguish one app from another. Based on the data retention schedule, New Relic will retain historical data collected under the old name, and will collect and aggregate data under the new name. If one or more apps share the same name, then their data will be aggregated in the UI. Caution If you change the app identifier, a new application will appear in our user interface with the new name, and data will stop reporting to the app(s) with the old name. Rename app via JavaScript snippet This information applies if you inserted the browser agent's JavaScript snippet into your: App monitored by APM that was deployed via the copy/paste method Single page app (SPA) Any standalone browser app that is not also monitored by APM You cannot directly edit the JavaScript snippet in the existing app. Instead, to use your app with a different name: Follow standard procedures to create a new app using the copy/paste method. Provide the new name, and generate the JavaScript snippet. Copy the new JavaScript snippet. In your webpage, replace the JavaScript from your original app with the JavaScript generated for the new app name. If your standalone app has multiple names, copy the custom app IDs in your configuration script to your new app. Based on the data retention schedule, New Relic will retain historical data collected under the old name, and will collect and aggregate data under the new name. Rename app via New Relic REST API (v2) This information applies only to browser apps that are also monitored by APM. You cannot change the app name via the REST API if you used the copy/paste method to insert browser's JavaScript snippet into your app. Follow standard procedures to change the APM app alias via REST API or API Explorer. New Relic automatically changes the display name for the app everywhere in the New Relic UI, including browser.",

Before you install the browser agent, make sure your system meets these requirements. Want to try out our browser monitoring? Create a New Relic account for free! No credit card required. Basic requirements To report data to browser, your application must at a minimum meet two basic requirements: The traffic to the application must be from clients able to load and execute browser JavaScript code and set cookies. Clients accessing the application must be able to send data to New Relic through HTTP requests. HTTPS is required for browser Pro features. Important Browsers that subscribe to a disconnect list or that use content filtering extensions such as AdBlock may not be able to send data to New Relic. For example, if you are using the Enhanced Tracking Prevention disconnect list for Mozilla Firefox 69.0 or higher, you will need to change the default configuration. Most typical browser applications meet these requirements. However, browser applications in restricted environments may have difficulty reporting data to New Relic; for example: Hybrid mobile applications Applications installed on unusual hardware, such as point-of-sale terminals or consumer appliances For more information, review the instrumentation for browser monitoring documentation, and verify end-user network access. Browser types Instrumentation is compatible with every browser type, including Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox, Microsoft Internet Explorer and Edge, and Apple Safari. The user interface is compatible with New Relic's supported browser versions. Exceptions Comments Paint timings The firstPaint and firstContentfulPaint attributes in BrowserInteraction, PageView, and PageViewTiming events are only compatible with: Chrome 60 or higher for desktop and mobile (Android webview and Chrome for Android) Opera 47 or higher for desktop Opera 44 or higher for Android mobile Samsung Internet for mobile AJAX AJAX timing features are not available with: Chrome for iPhone and iPad IE 7 and 8 PageAction events PageAction events require a browser that fully supports cross-domain XMLHttpRequests. Internet Explorer versions 9 and lower cannot record PageAction events. Learn more on querying your data. Session traces Session traces are reported only from browsers that support the Resource Timing Specification. SHA-256 New Relic can only monitor browsers that are compatible with SHA-256. APM agents You can deploy the browser agent for apps monitored by APM, or you can deploy the browser agent for your standalone apps. For more information, see the installation procedures. If you are deploying browser for an app using APM, make sure your agent supports browser monitoring: C SDK: Version 1.0.0 or higher Go: Version 2.5.0 or higher Java: Version 3.4.0 or higher .NET: Version 2.20.25.0 or higher Node.js: Version 1.4.0 or higher PHP: Version 4.4.5.35 or higher Python: Version 2.10.1.9 or higher Ruby: Version 3.7.0.177 or higher Supported frameworks The browser agent collects data on all front-end frameworks. However, the monitoring occurs on lower-level \"primitives\" that JavaScript frameworks use, so the level of detail collected by the instrumentation may vary depending on your specific framework. Exceptions Comments Zone.js If you're using AngularJS and you want to use our SPA monitoring features, note that Zone.js versions 0.6.18 to 0.6.24 are not compatible with browser. In all cases, the browser agent must be loaded before Zone.js to avoid errors. Cypress.io Browser is unable to properly instrument the open and send methods of requests when tests are run in Cypress. This will cause the following error to be thrown: Cannot set property 'status' of undefined Copy This will only affect customers running tests with the Browser agent present in their code. Production applications should not be affected. html2pdf.js This library is not compatible with our Pro+SPA agent due to the way this library wraps promises. If you're using this library, we recommend selecting the Pro agent type. Content Security Policy (CSP) considerations In order to obtain accurate browser performance metrics, browser requires the use of a small, inline JavaScript snippet. New Relic carefully reviews the inline JavaScript to prevent Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) and other potential vulnerabilities. Content Security Policy Level 2 adds restrictions to the types of JavaScript allowed, such as inline scripts. It also limits which domains can load scripts during page load. Important If your website does not allow any third-party hosted JavaScript to run, you must request a CSP exception via your organization’s standard procedures in order to install the browser monitoring agent. When requesting a CSP exception, follow your organization's standard procedures to contact your web or security team. The browser JavaScript agent requires the following CSP exceptions in order to run properly. Alternatively, you can add all of these exceptions to the fallback default-src directive (instead of script-src and connect-src). CSP exception Comments unsafe-inline Add to the script-src directive or to the fallback default-src directive. This is required because the agent is installed by including an inline script. https://js-agent.newrelic.com Add to the script-src directive or to the fallback default-src directive. This is where additional script files that the agent requires are hosted. https://bam.nr-data.net https://bam-cell.nr-data.net Important Add https://gov-bam.nr-data.net if you're using FedRAMP-compliant endpoints. Add to the script-src directive or to the fallback default-src directive. This is where the agent sends its collected data. One of the calls to this URL is a JSONP call, which means that the URL must be allowed as a script source. Add to the connect-src directive or to the fallback default-src directive. The connect-src directive affects the URLs that scripts can call (for example, using the XMLHttpRequest interface). If you have CSP restrictions specifically around this directive, then add this URL as an exception.",

      "body": "Your end-user experience depends on your entire technology stack. You need to quickly understand what's causing a customer complaint or issue. Did the problem come from your infrastructure, your application, or the browsers that ultimately render it? Is it the result of a problematic internet provider, a problem in your own data center with failing CPU or memory, or something else? More than Real User Monitoring (RUM) Many websites contain dynamic content that is loaded after the initial page has finished loading, and complex JavaScript code increases the need for error reporting. Browser monitoring in New Relic One provides a Real User Monitoring (RUM) solution that measures the speed and performance of your end users as they navigate to your site from different web browsers, devices, operating systems, and networks. With browser monitoring in New Relic One, you see actionable data about your end users' experience with your app. But browser monitoring in New Relic goes far beyond the initial page load to measure full page life cycle data. For example, our browser UI shows you: Actual performance data, such as by page view popularity and user satisfaction (Apdex) scores Perceived performance data that measures how quickly your async or dynamic visuals and interactive page contents display JavaScript error analytics, stack traces, and line-of-code visibility, to show you the end-user steps leading up to an error itself Session performance with a detailed timeline and heat map of the load and interaction events during a webpage's full life cycle AJAX requests indicating problems with timing, end points, and specific locations in the webpage Hash-based route changes in apps with single-page application (SPA) architectures These tools (and more!) help your teams optimize your end users' page load experience, eliminate bugs, and troubleshoot faster across your full stack. Examine user perceptions Real user data gives insights into actual page performance, but you also need to look into your users' perception of your site's performance. Pages can load content in many different ways, and users control when they interact with that content. This is why some user-centric performance metrics happen outside the standard window onload (page load time) in the browser monitoring agent. The PageViewTiming event provides a more real-time delivery mechanism that does not have a dependency on any other event. Additional metrics include: First paint, first contentful paint, and largest contentful paint First input delay First interaction This helps you understand how users experience your site, both from visual and responsiveness standpoints. Improve interactive app performance Our single-page app (SPA) monitoring automatically tracks route changes, initial page loads, and synchronous and asynchronous activity during browser interactions. You can also use our browser agent and SPA API to monitor virtually anything that executes inside the browser. If you are a developer, SPA monitoring can help you: Create faster, more responsive, highly interactive apps. Monitor the throughput and performance that real users are experiencing. Troubleshoot and resolve problems within the context of the page load. Query and visualize the data to assist with business decisions. Bring better apps to the marketplace more quickly. Correlate front-end and back-end problems With New Relic One, you can instrument any type of data you need, such as metrics, events, logs, and traces. This helps you find actionable data about your end users' experience across the stack. For example: Full-Stack Observability Comments Locations or domains Limit browser monitoring to focus on specific geographical locations or specific types of end-user activity. You can also monitor or block specific domains. Trends in interactions Use our comparative charting feature for a direct page load time comparison between real user (browser) interactions and trends appearing in Synthetic monitors. Distributed tracing Isolate latency from the web browser through back-end services with distributed tracing. The UI helps you see the connection across across a full transaction, from browser activity, to time spent in network, to back-end activity. Browser types Explore your end users' experience with your app segmented by any types of browsers they use, including: Top browsers by throughput Average page load time by platform type (mobile, desktop, and other) Selected browser type by version (for example, Chrome 31, 32, 33, etc.) This helps you quickly determine whether problems with page load timing may be related to a specific browser type or platform, or whether the problem is more widespread. Get started with browser monitoring Follow these basic steps, and you'll quickly be up and running in New Relic with browser monitoring! Review the compatibility details and basic requirements for browser monitoring. Install the browser agent. Go to [one.newrelic.com > Explorer > Browser applications. Use the Explorer to access all your entities, that is, anything we can identify that reports data, from applications and hosts to custom groupings of any elements. View summary data from your Browser summary page, then drill down into page load timing details and other UI data. Configure your alerts for key performance data, or use our Applied Intelligence solutions to reduce alert noise, correlate incidents, and automatically detect anomalies. Query and visualize your default data (or customize your own), then analyze what that data says about your business. Customize and share your own charts and dashboards.",

      "body": "New Relic's .NET agent supports both .NET Framework and .NET Core. This document describes compatibility and support for .NET Core applications. See Compatibility and requirements for .NET Framework for .NET Framework applications. New Relic's .NET agent includes built-in instrumentation for some of the most popular parts of the .NET Core ecosystem, including frameworks, databases, and message queuing systems. After installation, the agent runs within the monitored process; there is not a separate process or service created by the agent. For frameworks and libraries that are not automatically instrumented out of the box, you can extend the agent with .NET custom instrumentation. Want to try out our .NET agent? Create a New Relic account for free! No credit card required. Requirements Before you install the New Relic .NET agent on Windows or Linux, make sure your system meets these requirements: Microsoft .NET Core version The .NET agent supports .NET Core versions 2.0, 2.1, 2.2, 3.0, 3.1, and .NET 5.0. Table of minimum agent versions required per .NET Core version .NET Core Version Minimum Required .NET Agent Version .NET Core 2.0 > = 8.19.353.0 .NET Core 2.1 > = 8.19.353.0 .NET Core 2.2 > = 8.19.353.0 .NET Core 3.0 > = 8.21.34.0 .NET Core 3.1 > = 8.21.34.0 .NET 5.0 > = 8.35.0 The agent is not compatible with .NET Core versions 1.0 or 1.1. For .NET Core 2.1 or higher applications with tiered compilation enabled, the agent will disable tiered compilation. .NET Core 2.1 support requires .NET Core runtime 2.1.3 and .NET Core SDK 2.1.401 or higher due to a bug in the .NET Core profiling API. Target framework version The .NET agent only supports applications targeting .NET Core 2.0, 2.1, 2.2, 3.0, 3.1, and NET 5.0. You can find the target framework in your .csproj file: Supported: <TargetFramework>netcoreapp2.0</TargetFramework> Copy <TargetFramework>netcoreapp2.1</TargetFramework> Copy <TargetFramework>netcoreapp2.2</TargetFramework> Copy <TargetFramework>netcoreapp3.0</TargetFramework> Copy <TargetFramework>netcoreapp3.1</TargetFramework> Copy <TargetFramework>net5.0</TargetFramework> Copy Unsupported: <TargetFramework>net452</TargetFramework> Copy Important If you want to monitor an ASP.NET Core application targeting .NET Framework, ensure your install of the .NET agent has .NET Framework support enabled. App/web servers Ensure you use one of these app/web servers: Kestrel Kestrel with IIS reverse proxy via AspNetCoreModule Kestrel with IIS reverse proxy via AspNetCoreModuleV2 Kestrel with Nginx reverse proxy Kestrel with Apache reverse proxy Operating system The agent has been verified to work with the following operating systems: Operating system Supported versions Windows (32- and 64-bit Intel compatible architectures) Server 2008 R2 SP1 Server 2012 Server 2012 R2 Server 2016 Server 2019 Windows containers running on Server 2016 (NanoServer based images are not supported) Linux (64-bit Intel compatible only) All x64 Linux distributions supported by the .NET Core 2.0+/.NET 5 runtime are supported by the .NET agent. For a full list, refer to Microsoft's documentation for the version of the runtime you are using. Microsoft Azure For Azure-specific installation instructions, see: Install on Azure Cloud Services Install on Azure Service Fabric Install on Azure Web Apps Processor architectures The agent is available in both 32-bit (x86) and 64-bit (x64) versions on Windows as well as 64-bit (x64) on Linux. Permissions Installing and running the .NET agent requires these permissions: Component Necessary permissions Install the agent The process or user that installs the agent must have sufficient permissions to set environment variables and write access to the directory where the agent is installed. Run the agent The monitored process must have read/write access to the directory in which you installed the agent. The agent runs as a part of the monitored process and relies on those permissions to function. For applications using IIS via reverse proxy, the group IIS_IUSRS is often used. Security requirements As a standard security measure for data collection, your app server must support SHA-2 (256-bit). SHA-1 is not supported. Network requirements The agent requires your firewall to allow outgoing connections to specific networks and ports. Automatic instrumentation If your application is hosted in ASP.NET Core, the agent automatically creates and instruments transactions. The .NET agent will automatically instrument your application after install. If your app is not automatically instrumented, or if you want to add instrumentation, use custom instrumentation. App frameworks The .NET agent automatically instruments these application frameworks: ASP.NET Core MVC 2.0, 2.1, 2.2, 3.0, 3.1, and 5.0 (includes Web API) Datastores The .NET agent automatically instruments the performance of .NET application calls to these datastores: Datastore Instance details Notes Microsoft SQL Server Use System.Data.SqlClient version 4.3.1 or Microsoft.Data.SqlClient. PostgresSQL Use Npgsql 4.0. Prior versions of Npgsql may also be instrumented, but duplicate and/or missing metrics are possible. MongoDB Use driver version 2.3.x, 2.4.x, 2.5.x, or 2.6.x. Driver version 2.7.x: The .NET agent does not support API methods introduced by driver version 2.7.x, but does support pre-existing methods from previous versions. MySQL Use MySql.Data version 6.10.4 or later, or use the MySQL Connector StackExchange.Redis The .NET agent does not directly monitor datastore processes. Also, the .NET SQL parameter capture in a query trace does not list parameters for a parameterized query or a stored procedure. Collecting instance details for supported datastores is enabled by default. To request instance-level information from datastores not currently listed, get support at support.newrelic.com. External call libraries The .NET agent automatically instruments these external call libraries : Libraries Supported methods HttpClient The agent instruments these HttpClient methods: SendAsync GetAsync PostAsync PutAsync DeleteAsync GetStringAsync GetStreamAsync GetByteArrayAsync Messaging The agent automatically instruments these message systems: RabbitMQ 5.1.0 or higher: Puts and takes on messages and queue purge. When receiving messages using an IBasicConsumer, the EventingBasicConsumer is the only implementation that is instrumented by the .NET agent. BasicGet is instrumented, but the agent does not support distributed tracing for BasicGet. The following methods are instrumented: IModel.BasicGet IModel.BasicPublish IModel.BasicComsume IModel.QueuePurge EventingBasicConsumer.HandleBasicDeliver Unavailable features The following features are not available for the .NET agent: Memory usage on Linux due to an ongoing .NET Core issue (try using .NET performance metrics to get this information) Automatic brower monitoring script injection (API or manual instrumentation is required) The .NET agent does not support trim self-contained deployments and executables, because the compiler can potentially trim assemblies that the agent depends on. Infinite Tracing is not supported on Alpine Linux due to a GRPC compatibility issue. See this agent issue for more information. Connect the agent to other New Relic products In addition to APM, the .NET agent integrates with other New Relic products to give you end-to-end visibility: Product Integration Browser monitoring The browser monitoring JavaScript agent will not be injected by the .NET agent for ASP.NET core applications. However, you can inject the browser agent by using the .NET agent API or the browser agent's copy/paste method. After enabling browser injection, you can view browser data in the APM Summary page and quickly switch between the APM and browser data for a particular app. For configuration options and manual instrumentation, see browser monitoring and the .NET agent. Infrastructure monitoring When you install the Infrastructure and APM agents on the same host, they automatically detect one another. You can then view a list of hosts in the APM UI, and filter your Infrastructure hosts by APM app in the Infrastructure UI. For more information, see APM data in Infrastructure. Dashboards The .NET agent sends default events and attributes for NRQL queries. You can also record custom events for advanced analysis.",

      "body": "Browser monitoring includes strict security measures to provide a robust, standalone product with browser monitoring features. Before you install the browser agent, make sure your system meets these requirements. Want to try out our browser monitoring? Create a New Relic account for free! No credit card required. Basic requirements To report data to browser, your application must at a minimum meet two basic requirements: The traffic to the application must be from clients able to load and execute browser JavaScript code and set cookies. Clients accessing the application must be able to send data to New Relic through HTTP requests. HTTPS is required for browser Pro features. Important Browsers that subscribe to a disconnect list or that use content filtering extensions such as AdBlock may not be able to send data to New Relic. For example, if you are using the Enhanced Tracking Prevention disconnect list for Mozilla Firefox 69.0 or higher, you will need to change the default configuration. Most typical browser applications meet these requirements. However, browser applications in restricted environments may have difficulty reporting data to New Relic; for example: Hybrid mobile applications Applications installed on unusual hardware, such as point-of-sale terminals or consumer appliances For more information, review the instrumentation for browser monitoring documentation, and verify end-user network access. Browser types Instrumentation is compatible with every browser type, including Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox, Microsoft Internet Explorer and Edge, and Apple Safari. The user interface is compatible with New Relic's supported browser versions. Exceptions Comments Paint timings The firstPaint and firstContentfulPaint attributes in BrowserInteraction, PageView, and PageViewTiming events are only compatible with: Chrome 60 or higher for desktop and mobile (Android webview and Chrome for Android) Opera 47 or higher for desktop Opera 44 or higher for Android mobile Samsung Internet for mobile AJAX AJAX timing features are not available with: Chrome for iPhone and iPad IE 7 and 8 PageAction events PageAction events require a browser that fully supports cross-domain XMLHttpRequests. Internet Explorer versions 9 and lower cannot record PageAction events. Learn more on querying your data. Session traces Session traces are reported only from browsers that support the Resource Timing Specification. SHA-256 New Relic can only monitor browsers that are compatible with SHA-256. APM agents You can deploy the browser agent for apps monitored by APM, or you can deploy the browser agent for your standalone apps. For more information, see the installation procedures. If you are deploying browser for an app using APM, make sure your agent supports browser monitoring: C SDK: Version 1.0.0 or higher Go: Version 2.5.0 or higher Java: Version 3.4.0 or higher .NET: Version 2.20.25.0 or higher Node.js: Version 1.4.0 or higher PHP: Version 4.4.5.35 or higher Python: Version 2.10.1.9 or higher Ruby: Version 3.7.0.177 or higher Supported frameworks The browser agent collects data on all front-end frameworks. However, the monitoring occurs on lower-level \"primitives\" that JavaScript frameworks use, so the level of detail collected by the instrumentation may vary depending on your specific framework. Exceptions Comments Zone.js If you're using AngularJS and you want to use our SPA monitoring features, note that Zone.js versions 0.6.18 to 0.6.24 are not compatible with browser. In all cases, the browser agent must be loaded before Zone.js to avoid errors. Cypress.io Browser is unable to properly instrument the open and send methods of requests when tests are run in Cypress. This will cause the following error to be thrown: Cannot set property 'status' of undefined Copy This will only affect customers running tests with the Browser agent present in their code. Production applications should not be affected. html2pdf.js This library is not compatible with our Pro+SPA agent due to the way this library wraps promises. If you're using this library, we recommend selecting the Pro agent type. Content Security Policy (CSP) considerations In order to obtain accurate browser performance metrics, browser requires the use of a small, inline JavaScript snippet. New Relic carefully reviews the inline JavaScript to prevent Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) and other potential vulnerabilities. Content Security Policy Level 2 adds restrictions to the types of JavaScript allowed, such as inline scripts. It also limits which domains can load scripts during page load. Important If your website does not allow any third-party hosted JavaScript to run, you must request a CSP exception via your organization’s standard procedures in order to install the browser monitoring agent. When requesting a CSP exception, follow your organization's standard procedures to contact your web or security team. The browser JavaScript agent requires the following CSP exceptions in order to run properly. Alternatively, you can add all of these exceptions to the fallback default-src directive (instead of script-src and connect-src). CSP exception Comments unsafe-inline Add to the script-src directive or to the fallback default-src directive. This is required because the agent is installed by including an inline script. https://js-agent.newrelic.com Add to the script-src directive or to the fallback default-src directive. This is where additional script files that the agent requires are hosted. https://bam.nr-data.net https://bam-cell.nr-data.net Important Add https://gov-bam.nr-data.net if you're using FedRAMP-compliant endpoints. Add to the script-src directive or to the fallback default-src directive. This is where the agent sends its collected data. One of the calls to this URL is a JSONP call, which means that the URL must be allowed as a script source. Add to the connect-src directive or to the fallback default-src directive. The connect-src directive affects the URLs that scripts can call (for example, using the XMLHttpRequest interface). If you have CSP restrictions specifically around this directive, then add this URL as an exception.",

      "body": "New Relic's .NET agent supports both .NET Framework and .NET Core. This document describes compatibility and support for .NET Core applications. See Compatibility and requirements for .NET Framework for .NET Framework applications. New Relic's .NET agent includes built-in instrumentation for some of the most popular parts of the .NET Core ecosystem, including frameworks, databases, and message queuing systems. After installation, the agent runs within the monitored process; there is not a separate process or service created by the agent. For frameworks and libraries that are not automatically instrumented out of the box, you can extend the agent with .NET custom instrumentation. Want to try out our .NET agent? Create a New Relic account for free! No credit card required. Requirements Before you install the New Relic .NET agent on Windows or Linux, make sure your system meets these requirements: Microsoft .NET Core version The .NET agent supports .NET Core versions 2.0, 2.1, 2.2, 3.0, 3.1, and .NET 5.0. Table of minimum agent versions required per .NET Core version .NET Core Version Minimum Required .NET Agent Version .NET Core 2.0 > = 8.19.353.0 .NET Core 2.1 > = 8.19.353.0 .NET Core 2.2 > = 8.19.353.0 .NET Core 3.0 > = 8.21.34.0 .NET Core 3.1 > = 8.21.34.0 .NET 5.0 > = 8.35.0 The agent is not compatible with .NET Core versions 1.0 or 1.1. For .NET Core 2.1 or higher applications with tiered compilation enabled, the agent will disable tiered compilation. .NET Core 2.1 support requires .NET Core runtime 2.1.3 and .NET Core SDK 2.1.401 or higher due to a bug in the .NET Core profiling API. Target framework version The .NET agent only supports applications targeting .NET Core 2.0, 2.1, 2.2, 3.0, 3.1, and NET 5.0. You can find the target framework in your .csproj file: Supported: <TargetFramework>netcoreapp2.0</TargetFramework> Copy <TargetFramework>netcoreapp2.1</TargetFramework> Copy <TargetFramework>netcoreapp2.2</TargetFramework> Copy <TargetFramework>netcoreapp3.0</TargetFramework> Copy <TargetFramework>netcoreapp3.1</TargetFramework> Copy <TargetFramework>net5.0</TargetFramework> Copy Unsupported: <TargetFramework>net452</TargetFramework> Copy Important If you want to monitor an ASP.NET Core application targeting .NET Framework, ensure your install of the .NET agent has .NET Framework support enabled. App/web servers Ensure you use one of these app/web servers: Kestrel Kestrel with IIS reverse proxy via AspNetCoreModule Kestrel with IIS reverse proxy via AspNetCoreModuleV2 Kestrel with Nginx reverse proxy Kestrel with Apache reverse proxy Operating system The agent has been verified to work with the following operating systems: Operating system Supported versions Windows (32- and 64-bit Intel compatible architectures) Server 2008 R2 SP1 Server 2012 Server 2012 R2 Server 2016 Server 2019 Windows containers running on Server 2016 (NanoServer based images are not supported) Linux (64-bit Intel compatible only) All x64 Linux distributions supported by the .NET Core 2.0+/.NET 5 runtime are supported by the .NET agent. For a full list, refer to Microsoft's documentation for the version of the runtime you are using. Microsoft Azure For Azure-specific installation instructions, see: Install on Azure Cloud Services Install on Azure Service Fabric Install on Azure Web Apps Processor architectures The agent is available in both 32-bit (x86) and 64-bit (x64) versions on Windows as well as 64-bit (x64) on Linux. Permissions Installing and running the .NET agent requires these permissions: Component Necessary permissions Install the agent The process or user that installs the agent must have sufficient permissions to set environment variables and write access to the directory where the agent is installed. Run the agent The monitored process must have read/write access to the directory in which you installed the agent. The agent runs as a part of the monitored process and relies on those permissions to function. For applications using IIS via reverse proxy, the group IIS_IUSRS is often used. Security requirements As a standard security measure for data collection, your app server must support SHA-2 (256-bit). SHA-1 is not supported. Network requirements The agent requires your firewall to allow outgoing connections to specific networks and ports. Automatic instrumentation If your application is hosted in ASP.NET Core, the agent automatically creates and instruments transactions. The .NET agent will automatically instrument your application after install. If your app is not automatically instrumented, or if you want to add instrumentation, use custom instrumentation. App frameworks The .NET agent automatically instruments these application frameworks: ASP.NET Core MVC 2.0, 2.1, 2.2, 3.0, 3.1, and 5.0 (includes Web API) Datastores The .NET agent automatically instruments the performance of .NET application calls to these datastores: Datastore Instance details Notes Microsoft SQL Server Use System.Data.SqlClient version 4.3.1 or Microsoft.Data.SqlClient. PostgresSQL Use Npgsql 4.0. Prior versions of Npgsql may also be instrumented, but duplicate and/or missing metrics are possible. MongoDB Use driver version 2.3.x, 2.4.x, 2.5.x, or 2.6.x. Driver version 2.7.x: The .NET agent does not support API methods introduced by driver version 2.7.x, but does support pre-existing methods from previous versions. MySQL Use MySql.Data version 6.10.4 or later, or use the MySQL Connector StackExchange.Redis The .NET agent does not directly monitor datastore processes. Also, the .NET SQL parameter capture in a query trace does not list parameters for a parameterized query or a stored procedure. Collecting instance details for supported datastores is enabled by default. To request instance-level information from datastores not currently listed, get support at support.newrelic.com. External call libraries The .NET agent automatically instruments these external call libraries : Libraries Supported methods HttpClient The agent instruments these HttpClient methods: SendAsync GetAsync PostAsync PutAsync DeleteAsync GetStringAsync GetStreamAsync GetByteArrayAsync Messaging The agent automatically instruments these message systems: RabbitMQ 5.1.0 or higher: Puts and takes on messages and queue purge. When receiving messages using an IBasicConsumer, the EventingBasicConsumer is the only implementation that is instrumented by the .NET agent. BasicGet is instrumented, but the agent does not support distributed tracing for BasicGet. The following methods are instrumented: IModel.BasicGet IModel.BasicPublish IModel.BasicComsume IModel.QueuePurge EventingBasicConsumer.HandleBasicDeliver Unavailable features The following features are not available for the .NET agent: Memory usage on Linux due to an ongoing .NET Core issue (try using .NET performance metrics to get this information) Automatic brower monitoring script injection (API or manual instrumentation is required) The .NET agent does not support trim self-contained deployments and executables, because the compiler can potentially trim assemblies that the agent depends on. Infinite Tracing is not supported on Alpine Linux due to a GRPC compatibility issue. See this agent issue for more information. Connect the agent to other New Relic products In addition to APM, the .NET agent integrates with other New Relic products to give you end-to-end visibility: Product Integration Browser monitoring The browser monitoring JavaScript agent will not be injected by the .NET agent for ASP.NET core applications. However, you can inject the browser agent by using the .NET agent API or the browser agent's copy/paste method. After enabling browser injection, you can view browser data in the APM Summary page and quickly switch between the APM and browser data for a particular app. For configuration options and manual instrumentation, see browser monitoring and the .NET agent. Infrastructure monitoring When you install the Infrastructure and APM agents on the same host, they automatically detect one another. You can then view a list of hosts in the APM UI, and filter your Infrastructure hosts by APM app in the Infrastructure UI. For more information, see APM data in Infrastructure. Dashboards The .NET agent sends default events and attributes for NRQL queries. You can also record custom events for advanced analysis.",

      "body": "You can tailor the Node.js agent to your app's requirements by editing your newrelic.js config file or by setting an environment variable. The config file resides in the root directory of your app. You can also configure a few options from New Relic, or use the Node.js agent API. Important The license_key setting is required. We highly recommend setting the app_name so that your app has a meaningful name instead of the default My Application. Configuration methods and precedence The primary method to configure the Node.js agent is the agent configuration file (newrelic.js). You can also configure most settings with environment variables. You can also adjust some settings with server-side configuration. The Node.js agent uses this order of precedence for configuration methods: Node.js configuration hierarchy: Server-side configuration settings override environment variables. Environment variables override the agent config file. The config file overrides the agent defaults. Here are detailed descriptions of each configuration method: Agent configuration file The config file (newrelic.js) contains every Node.js agent setting. When you install the Node.js agent, you must copy newrelic.js into your app's root directory. Most settings are empty by default; they inherit their values from config/default.js. Environment variables Most configuration settings in newrelic.js have equivalent environment variables. These are useful, for example, if your agent runs in a PaaS environment such as Heroku or Microsoft Azure. Node.js agent environment variables always start with NEW_RELIC_. Where available, these environment variables are documented below under individual config options as the Environ variable. There are also two rarely used settings that can only be configured via environment variables. Server-side configuration Owners and Admins can view and configure a few settings directly in New Relic. Where available, the UI labels for server-side config are listed in this document under individual config options as the Server-side label. Exports variables This section defines the Node.js agent variables in the order they typically appear in the exports.config = { section of your app's newrelic.js configuration file. app_name (REQUIRED) Type String Default \"My Application\" Environ variable NEW_RELIC_APP_NAME The name New Relic uses to identify your app. For example, app_name: ['MyNodeApp']. To use multiple names for your app, specify a comma-delimited list of names. Data for all applications with the same name will be merged in the New Relic UI, so set this carefully. We highly recommend that you replace the default name with a descriptive name to avoid confusion and unintended aggregation of data. Tip For Azure users, the Node.js agent will use APP_POOL_ID if it is set, so you can use the name you chose for your Azure Web Server without setting it twice. license_key (REQUIRED) Type String Default (none) Environ variable NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY This setting is required. Your New Relic license key. For example, license_key: '40HexadecimalCharacters'. agent_enabled Type Boolean Default true Environ variable NEW_RELIC_ENABLED Set to false to stop the agent from starting up. This is useful when debugging your code requires temporarily disabling the agent. It prevents the agent from bootstrapping its instrumentation or setting up all its pieces, which prevents the agent from starting up and connecting to New Relic's servers. allow_all_headers If true, enables capture of all HTTP headers, except for those filtered by exclude rules. If false, collected headers are limited to those defined in Node.js agent attributes. Type Boolean Default false Caution Any header-related include/exclude rules must be in camelCase form to be filtered. apdex_t (DEPRECATED) Type Number Default 0.100 Server-side label Apdex T Set your Apdex T via the New Relic UI. certificates Type Array of strings Default (none) Additional certificates to trust for SSL connections, specified as an array of strings in PEM format. This affects both connections to an HTTPS proxy and connections to New Relic. Tip You can also configure the agent to read its certificates from a file: certificates: [ fs.readFileSync('myca.crt', {encoding: 'utf8'}) ] Copy high_security Type Boolean Default false Environ variable NEW_RELIC_HIGH_SECURITY When set to true, enables high security v2. You must also enable the ssl setting and enable high security in the UI. host Type String Default collector.newrelic.com Environ variable NEW_RELIC_HOST Important Do not edit this value unless New Relic Support asks you to change it. Hostname for the New Relic collector to connect to the Internet; for example, host: 'collector.newrelic.com'. labels Adds tags. Specify your tags as objects or a semicolon-delimited string of colon-separated pairs (for example, Server:One;Data Center:Primary). Type Object or string Default (none) Environ variable NEW_RELIC_LABELS port Type Integer Default 443 Environ variable NEW_RELIC_PORT Important Do not edit this value unless New Relic Support asks you to change it. Port number to connect to the New Relic collector; for example, port: 443. proxy Type String Default (none) Environ variable NEW_RELIC_PROXY_URL A URL specifying the proxy server to connect to the Internet. For example, proxy: 'http://user:pass@10.0.0.1:8000/'. Important The proxy config file setting overrides the other config file proxy settings (proxy_host, proxy_port, proxy_user, proxy_pass) if used. Similarly, the NEW_RELIC_PROXY_URL environment variable overrides the other environment variable proxy settings (NEW_RELIC_PROXY_HOST, NEW_RELIC_PROXY_PORT, NEW_RELIC_PROXY_USER, and NEW_RELIC_PROXY_PASS) if used. proxy_host Type String Default (none) Environ variable NEW_RELIC_PROXY_HOST Hostname or IP address of the proxy server to connect to the Internet. proxy_pass Type String Default (none) Environ variable NEW_RELIC_PROXY_PASS Password for authenticating to the proxy server. The agent supports only basic HTTP authentication. proxy_port Type String Default (none) Environ variable NEW_RELIC_PROXY_PORT Port number of the proxy server to connect to the Internet. proxy_user Type String Default (none) Environ variable NEW_RELIC_PROXY_USER User name for authenticating to the proxy server. The agent supports only basic HTTP authentication. Logging variables This section defines the Node.js agent variables in the order they typically appear in the logging: { section of your app's newrelic.js configuration file. enabled Type String Default true (false in serverless_mode) Environ variable NEW_RELIC_LOG_ENABLED Enables or disables agent specific logging. level Type String Default info Environ variable NEW_RELIC_LOG_LEVEL Defines the level of detail recorded in the agent logs. From least detail to most detail, possible values are fatal, error, warn, info, debug, or trace. Caution Do not use debug or trace logging unless New Relic Support asks you to use them. These levels of logging can generate excessive overhead. For most situations, use info. filepath Type String Default process.cwd() plus newrelic_agent.log Environ variable NEW_RELIC_LOG Complete path to the New Relic agent log, including the filename. Defaults to filepath: require('path').join(process.cwd(), 'newrelic_agent.log'). The agent will shut down the process if it cannot create this file. The agent creates a log file with the same permissions as the parent Node.js agent process. To write all logging to stdout, set this to stdout. To write all logging to stderr, set this to stderr. Audit logging This section defines the Node.js agent variables in the order they typically appear in the audit_log: { section of your app's newrelic.js configuration file. enabled Type Boolean Default false Environ variable NEW_RELIC_AUDIT_LOG_ENABLED When enabled, the agent logs the payloads it sends to the collector. This data is included in the main log file even when logging level is set to the lowest level. endpoints Type Array Default Empty array (include all types) Environ variable NEW_RELIC_AUDIT_LOG_ENDPOINTS The agent sends several different types of data to the collector in separate payloads. By default, all of them are included in the log file. This option makes it possible to limit logging only to specific types of data. Valid values include: agent_settings analytic_event_data connect custom_event_data error_data error_event_data metric_data preconnect shutdown span_event_data sql_trace_data transaction_sample_data API configuration This section allows you to choose which API methods are enabled. Each configuration option allows you to modularly enable API methods that are responsible for sending custom information to New Relic. Important All of these are set to false when the agent is in high security mode. custom_attributes_enabled Type Boolean Default true Environ variable NEW_RELIC_API_CUSTOM_ATTRIBUTES This option enables newrelic.addCustomAttribute and newrelic.addCustomAttributes. custom_events_enabled Type Boolean Default true Environ variable NEW_RELIC_API_CUSTOM_EVENTS This option enables recordCustomEvent. notice_error_enabled Type Boolean Default true Environ variable NEW_RELIC_API_NOTICE_ERROR This option enables newrelic.noticeError. Attributes This section defines the variables for Node.js agent attributes in the order they typically appear in the attributes: { section of your app's newrelic.js configuration file. Caution Any header-related include/exclude rules must be in camelCase form to be filtered. enabled Type Boolean Default true Environ variable NEW_RELIC_ATTRIBUTES_ENABLED If true, enables capture of attributes for all destinations. exclude Type Array Default [] Environ variable NEW_RELIC_ATTRIBUTES_EXCLUDE Prefix of attributes to exclude from all destinations. Allows * as wildcard at end. include Type Array Default [] Environ variable NEW_RELIC_ATTRIBUTES_INCLUDE Prefix of attributes to include from all destinations. Allows * as wildcard at end. include_enabled Type Boolean Default true Environ variable NEW_RELIC_ATTRIBUTES_INCLUDE_ENABLED When true, patterns may be added to the attributes.include list. Error collector variables You can manage how error are handled in New Relic. This section defines the Node.js agent variables in the order they typically appear in the error_collector: { section of your app's newrelic.js configuration file. enabled Type Boolean Default true Environ variable NEW_RELIC_ERROR_COLLECTOR_ENABLED Server-side label Enable error collection? When enabled, the agent collects error traces from your app. ignore_status_codes Type Array Default 404 Environ variable NEW_RELIC_ERROR_COLLECTOR_IGNORE_ERROR_CODES Server-side label Ignore these status codes Comma-delimited list of HTTP status codes for the error collector to ignore. Caution Errors recorded using newrelic.noticeError do not obey this configuration value. ignore_classes Type Array|Object Default [] Environ variable NEW_RELIC_ERROR_COLLECTOR_IGNORE_ERRORS Comma-delimited list of javascript error types/classes for the error collector to ignore. The following configuration /* ... */ error_collector: { ignore_classes: [\"ReferenceError\"] } /* ... */ Copy Would ignore all reference errors. Caution Errors recorded using newrelic.noticeError do not obey this configuration value. ignore_messages Type Object Default {} A javascript object describing a list of javascript classes tied to javascript error messages for the collector to ignore. The following configuration. /* ... */ error_collector: { /* ... */ ignore_messages: {\"Error\":[\"Undefined\", \"Out of time\"]} /* ... */ } /* ... */ Copy Would ignore all errors of type Error, with the exact (case-sensitive) message strings of Undefined and Out of time. Caution Errors recorded using newrelic.noticeError do not obey this configuration value. expected_status_codes Type Array Default [] Environ variable NEW_RELIC_ERROR_COLLECTOR_EXPECTED_ERROR_CODES Comma-delimited list of HTTP status codes for the error collector to mark as expected. Caution Errors recorded using newrelic.noticeError do not obey this configuration value. expected_classes Type Array Default [] Environ variable NEW_RELIC_ERROR_COLLECTOR_EXPECTED_ERRORS The following configuration /* ... */ error_collector: { expected_classes: [\"ReferenceError\"] } /* ... */ Copy Would mark all reference errors as expected. Caution Errors recorded using newrelic.noticeError do not obey this configuration value. expected_messages Type Object Default {} A javascript object describing a list of javascript classes tied to javascript error messages for the collector to ignore. The following configuration. /* ... */ error_collector: { /* ... */ expected_messages: {\"Error\":[\"Undefined\", \"Out of time\"]} /* ... */ } /* ... */ Copy Would mark all errors of type Error, with the exact (case-sensitive) message strings of Undefined and Out of time. Caution Errors recorded using newrelic.noticeError do not obey this configuration value. attributes.enabled Type Boolean Default true Environ variable NEW_RELIC_ERROR_COLLECTOR_ATTRIBUTES_ENABLED If true, the agent captures attributes from error collection. Caution Any header-related include/exclude rules must be in camelCase form to be filtered. attributes.exclude Type Array Default [] Environ variable NEW_RELIC_ERROR_COLLECTOR_ATTRIBUTES_EXCLUDE Prefix of attributes to exclude from error collection. Allows * as wildcard at end. attributes.include Type Array Default [] Environ variable NEW_RELIC_ERROR_COLLECTOR_ATTRIBUTES_INCLUDE Prefix of attributes to include in error collection. Allows * as wildcard at end. max_event_samples_stored Type Integer Default 100 Environ variable NEW_RELIC_ERROR_COLLECTOR_MAX_EVENT_SAMPLES_STORED Defines the maximum number of events the agent collects per minute. If there are more than this number, the agent collects a statistical sampling. Transaction tracer variables The agent groups your requests into transactions, which are used to: Visualize where your app spends its time (in transaction breakdowns). Identify slow requests. Group metrics. Isolate other issues, such as slow database performance. This section defines the Node.js agent variables in the order they typically appear in the transaction_tracer: { section of your app's newrelic.js configuration file. Important Do not use brackets [suffix] at the end of your transaction name. New Relic automatically strips brackets from the name. Instead, use parentheses (suffix) or other symbols if needed. enabled Type Boolean Default true Environ variable NEW_RELIC_TRACER_ENABLED Server-side label Enable transaction tracing? When enabled, the agent collects slow transaction traces. explain_threshold Type Integer Default 500 Environ variable NEW_RELIC_EXPLAIN_THRESHOLD Minimum query duration (in milliseconds) for a transaction to be eligible for slow queries in transaction traces. record_sql Type String (off, obfuscated, or raw) Default off Environ variable NEW_RELIC_RECORD_SQL This option affects both slow queries and record_sql for transaction traces. It can have one of three values: off, obfuscated, or raw. When set to off no slow queries will be captured, and backtraces and SQL will not be included in transaction traces. If set to raw or obfuscated, the agent sends raw or obfuscated SQL and a slow query sample to the collector. The agent may also send SQL when other criteria are met, such as when slow_sql.enabled is set. top_n Type Integer Default 20 Environ variable NEW_RELIC_TRACER_TOP_N Defines the maximum number of requests eligible for transaction traces. Transactions are named based on the request, and top_n refers to the \"top n slowest transactions\" grouped by these names. The module replaces a recorded trace with a new trace only if the new trace is slower than the previous slowest trace of that name. The default value for this setting is top_n: 20, because the Transactions page also defaults to the 20 slowest transactions. The Node.js agent captures at least five different slow transactions in the first harvest cycle after start up. It will also reset and capture different transactions if no slow transactions have been captured for the last five harvest cycles. This allows you to see more information about more of your app's request paths, at the possible cost of not focusing on the absolutely slowest request for that harvest cycle. Tip To record the absolute slowest transaction over the last minute, you can set top_n: 0 or top_n: 1. However, this causes one very slow route to dominate your transaction traces. transaction_threshold Type Integer or apdex_f Default apdex_f Environ variable NEW_RELIC_TRACER_THRESHOLD Server-side label Threshold Threshold of web transaction response time in seconds beyond which a transaction is eligible for transaction tracing. The default value is apdex_f; this sets the trace threshold to four times your application's Apdex T. You can also enter a specific time value in milliseconds. Example: Threshold set to apdex_f The default apdex_t is 100 milliseconds. If your transaction threshold is set to apdex_f, a \"slow\" transaction is 400 milliseconds. hide_internals Type boolean Default true Environ variable NEW_RELIC_HIDE_INTERNALS The agent uses a small amount of CPU in order to hide internal properties that are attached to the web application. If you change this configuration to false, it may slightly decrease your agent overhead, but it could also have an impact on the performance of the agent. attributes.enabled Type Boolean Default true Environ variable NEW_RELIC_TRANSACTION_TRACER_ATTRIBUTES_ENABLED If true, the agent captures attributes from transaction traces. Caution Any header-related include/exclude rules must be in camelCase form to be filtered. attributes.exclude Type Array Default [] Environ variable NEW_RELIC_TRANSACTION_TRACER_ATTRIBUTES_EXCLUDE Prefix of attributes to exclude from transaction traces. Allows * as wildcard at end. attributes.include Type Array Default [] Environ variable NEW_RELIC_TRANSACTION_TRACER_ATTRIBUTES_INCLUDE Prefix of attributes to include in transaction traces. Allows * as wildcard at end. Rules variables This section defines the Node.js agent variables in the order they typically appear in the rules: { section of your app's newrelic.js configuration file. name Type Strings or regular expressions Default (none) Environ variable NEW_RELIC_NAMING_RULES A comma-delimited list of rules to match incoming request URLs and name the associated New Relic transaction. Uses the format: name: [ {pattern: 'STRING_OR_REGEX', name: 'NAME'}, {pattern: 'STRING_OR_REGEX', name: 'NAME'} ], Copy Both parameters are required. For strings, you must escape control characters. You do not need to escape control characters in regular expressions. Additional attributes are ignored. Regular expressions support JavaScript-style capture groups, and names use $1-style replacement strings. Regular expressions only find the first matching result; subsequent matches are ignored. For more information, see Node.js transaction naming API. For the NEW_RELIC_NAMING_RULES environment variable, pass the rules as comma-delimited JSON object literals: NEW_RELIC_NAMING_RULES='{\"pattern\":\"^t\",\"name\":\"u\"},{\"pattern\":\"^u\",\"name\":\"t\"}' Copy ignore Type Strings or regular expressions Default Regular expression to match socket.io long-polling requests (\"^ \\ /socket \\ .io \\ /. * \\ /xhr-polling/\"). Environ variable NEW_RELIC_IGNORING_RULES Define a list of request URLs you want the agent to ignore. Specify the list as patterns, which can be strings or regular expressions. enforce_backstop Type Boolean Default true Environ variable NEW_RELIC_ENFORCE_BACKSTOP Caution Do not change this setting unless you understand metric grouping issues. When enabled, the agent renames transactions that are not affected by other naming logic (such as the API, rules, or metric normalization rules) to NormalizedUri/*. If you set this to false, the agent sets transaction names to Uri/path/to/resource. Transaction events variables This section defines the Node.js agent variables in the order they typically appear in the transaction_events: { section of your app's newrelic.js configuration file. enabled Type Boolean Default true When enabled, the agent sends transaction events to New Relic. This event data includes transaction timing, transaction name, and any custom parameters. If this is disabled, the agent does not collect this data or send it to New Relic. max_samples_stored Type Integer Default 10000 Environ variable NEW_RELIC_TRANSACTION_EVENTS_MAX_SAMPLES_STORED Defines the maximum number of events the agent collects per minute. If there are more than this number, the agent collects a statistical sampling. We do not recommend configuring past 10,000. The server will cap data at 10,000 per-minute. Important This configuration had different behavior in agent versions lower than 6.0.0. See max_samples_stored (DEPRECATED) for agent versions 5.x or lower. max_samples_stored (DEPRECATED) Type Integer Default 20000 Defines the maximum number of events the agent stores if it is unable to communicate with the New Relic collector. The values from the previous harvest cycle will be merged into the next one, with this option limiting the maximum number. Make sure this number is greater than max_samples_per_minute; for example, set it to twice as much. Consider your memory overhead before increasing this value. Caution This configuration has different behavior starting with agent version 6.0.0 and a new recommended maximum. See max_samples_stored for agent versions 6.x or higher. max_samples_per_minute (DEPRECATED) Type Integer Default 10000 Defines the maximum number of events the agent collects per minute. If there are more than this number, the agent collects a statistical sampling. Caution This configuration has been replaced with max_samples_stored starting with version 6.0.0 of the agent. See max_samples_stored for 6.x or later agents. attributes.enabled Type Boolean Default true Environ variable NEW_RELIC_TRANSACTION_EVENTS_ATTRIBUTES_ENABLED If true, the agent captures attributes from transaction events. Caution Any header-related include/exclude rules must be in camelCase form to be filtered. attributes.exclude Type Array Default [] Environ variable NEW_RELIC_TRANSACTION_EVENTS_ATTRIBUTES_EXCLUDE Prefix of attributes to exclude from transaction events. Allows * as wildcard at end. attributes.include Type Array Default [] Environ variable NEW_RELIC_TRANSACTION_EVENTS_ATTRIBUTES_INCLUDE Prefix of attributes to include in transaction events. Allows * as wildcard at end. Browser monitoring variables This section defines the Node.js agent variables in the order they typically appear in the browser_monitoring: { section of your app's newrelic.js configuration file. enable Type Boolean Default true Environ variable NEW_RELIC_BROWSER_MONITOR_ENABLE Server-side label Enable browser monitoring? Generate JavaScript headers for browser instrumentation. Although this defaults to true, the agent doesn't inject the browser JS code unless you have enabled browser monitoring. Even if you have enabled it and added the browser timing header, you can disable browser monitoring for your app by setting this to false. debug Type Boolean Default false Environ variable NEW_RELIC_BROWSER_MONITOR_DEBUG If true, request un-minified sources from the server. attributes.enabled Type Boolean Default false Environ variable NEW_RELIC_BROWSER_MONITORING_ATTRIBUTES_ENABLED If true, the agent sends custom attributes to browser monitoring. Caution Any header-related include/exclude rules must be in camelCase form to be filtered. attributes.exclude Type Array Default [] Environ variable NEW_RELIC_BROWSER_MONITORING_ATTRIBUTES_EXCLUDE Prefix of attributes to exclude from browser monitoring. Allows * as wildcard at end. attributes.include Type Array Default [] Environ variable NEW_RELIC_BROWSER_MONITORING_ATTRIBUTES_INCLUDE Prefix of attributes to include in browser monitoring. Allows * as wildcard at end. Custom events variables This section defines the Node.js agent variables in the order they typically appear in the custom_insights_events: { section of your app's newrelic.js configuration file. Currently there are no environment variables for custom events. enabled Type Boolean Default true When enabled, the agent sends custom events recorded with recordCustomEvent() to New Relic. If this is disabled, the agent does not collect this data or send it to New Relic. max_samples_stored Type Integer Default 1000 Environ variable NEW_RELIC_CUSTOM_INSIGHTS_EVENTS_MAX_SAMPLES_STORED Defines the maximum number of custom events the agent collects per minute. If the number of custom events exceeds this limit, the agent collects a statistical sampling. Important Increasing this limit increases memory usage. Slow queries variables This section defines the Node.js agent variables in the order they typically appear in the slow_sql: { section of your app's newrelic.js configuration file. These options control behavior for slow queries, but do not affect SQL nodes in transaction traces. enabled Type Boolean Default false Environ variable NEW_RELIC_SLOW_SQL_ENABLED When enabled, the agent collects slow query details. max_samples Type Integer Default 10 Environ variable NEW_RELIC_MAX_SQL_SAMPLES Defines the maximum number of slow queries the agent collects per minute. The agent discards additional queries after the limit is reached. Important Increasing this limit increases memory usage. Custom hostname variables This section defines the Node.js agent variables in the order they typically appear in the process_host: { section of your app's newrelic.js configuration file. These options control behavior regarding the host display name in the APM UI. display_name Type String of 255 bytes or less Default (none) Environ variable NEW_RELIC_PROCESS_HOST_DISPLAY_NAME Specify a custom hostname for display in New Relic. If you do not set this field, New Relic will continue to use the default hostname found by calling os.hostname(). If you use the default hostname settings, New Relic finds the hostname through os.hostname(). If this call fails, New Relic uses the host's IP as the name. If you set ipv_preference: 4 or ipv_preference: 6, you can select the type of IP address (IPv4 or IPv6) that appears in the New Relic UI. ipv_preference Type Integer (4 or 6) Default 4 Environ variable NEW_RELIC_IPV_PREFERENCE Environment variable overrides This section defines two configuration options only available with environment variables. These overrides are not used in most configurations. NEW_RELIC_HOME Path to the directory containing newrelic.js. This is available only as an environment variable. You cannot set it in your config file. Type String Default (none) NEW_RELIC_NO_CONFIG_FILE If used, this prevents the agent from reading configuration settings from newrelic.js. Default values and values from environment variables will still be set. This is available only as an environment variable. You cannot set it in your config file. Type Boolean Default False Datastore tracer variables This section defines the Node.js agent variables in the order they typically appear in the datastore_tracer section of your app's newrelic.js configuration file. These options control behavior for collecting datastore instance metrics. instance_reporting.enabled Type Boolean Default true When enabled, the agent collects datastore instance metrics (such as host and port) for some database drivers. These are reported on slow query traces and transaction traces. database_name_reporting.enabled Type Boolean Default true When enabled, the agent collects database name on slow query traces and transaction traces for some database drivers. Cross application tracing (DEPRECATED) The Node.js agent variables that control cross application tracing typically appear in the cross_application_tracer section of your app's newrelic.js configuration file: enabled Type Boolean Default false When set to true, allows tracing of transactions across more than one New Relic-monitored applications. Important Cross application tracing (CAT) has been deprecated and will be removed in a future major release. For cross-service visibility, we recommend using distributed tracing, which is enabled by default as of agent version 8.3.0. Before enabling, read the transition guide. Error message redaction variables The Node.js agent variables that control error message redaction appear in the allow_raw_exception_messages section of your app's newrelic.js configuration file: enabled Type Boolean Default true Environ variable NEW_RELIC_ALLOW_RAW_EXCEPTION_MESSAGES_ENABLED When false, the agent will redact the messages of captured errors. Distributed tracing Important Enabling distributed tracing disables cross application tracing, and has effects on other APM features. Before enabling, read the transition guide. Requires Node.js agent version 4.7.0 or higher. Distributed tracing lets you see the path that a request takes as it travels through a distributed system. When configuring via the config file, place the following option in the distributed_tracing section. enabled Type Boolean Default true Environ variable NEW_RELIC_DISTRIBUTED_TRACING_ENABLED Set this to true to enable distributed tracing. For example, to enable this in the config file, you would use: distributed_tracing: { enabled: true } Copy exclude_newrelic_header Type Boolean Default false Set this to true to exclude the New Relic header that is attached to outbound requests, and instead only rely on W3C Trace Context Headers for distributed tracing. If this is false then both types of headers are used. For example, to enable this in the config file, you would use: distributed_tracing:{ enabled: true, exclude_newrelic_header: true } Copy Span events Span data is reported for distributed tracing. Distributed tracing must be enabled to report spans. Span configuration is set in the span_events stanza. Options include: enabled Type Boolean Default true Environ variable NEW_RELIC_SPAN_EVENTS_ENABLED Turns reporting of span events on or off. attributes.enabled Type Boolean Default true Environ variable NEW_RELIC_SPAN_EVENTS_ATTRIBUTES_ENABLED This setting can be used to turn reporting of attributes on or off for spans. If attributes.enabled at the root level is false, no attributes will be sent with spans regardless on how this is set. attributes.include Type Array Default [] Environ variable NEW_RELIC_SPAN_EVENTS_ATTRIBUTES_INCLUDE If attributes are enabled for spans, all attribute keys found in this list will be attached to spans. For more information, see the agent attribute rules. attributes.exclude Type Array Default [] Environ variable NEW_RELIC_SPAN_EVENTS_ATTRIBUTES_EXCLUDE All attribute keys found in this list will not be sent with spans. For more information, see the agent attribute rules. max_samples_stored Type Integer Default 2000 Environ variable NEW_RELIC_SPAN_EVENTS_MAX_SAMPLES_STORED Defines the maximum number of events the agent collects per minute. If there are more than this number, the agent collects a statistical sampling. We do not recommend configuring past 10k. The server will cap data at 10k per-minute. Infinite Tracing To turn on Infinite Tracing, enable distributed tracing (set distributed_tracing to enabled: true) and add the additional settings below. For an example, see Language agents: configure distributed tracing. trace_observer.host Type String Default (none) Environ variable NEW_RELIC_INFINITE_TRACING_TRACE_OBSERVER_HOST For help getting a valid Infinite Tracing trace observer host entry, see Find or create a trace observer endpoint.",

Important Browsers that subscribe to a disconnect list or that use content filtering extensions such as AdBlock may not be able to send data to New Relic. For example, if you are using the Enhanced Tracking Prevention disconnect list for Mozilla Firefox 69.0 or higher, you will need to change the default configuration. Most typical browser applications meet these requirements. However, browser applications in restricted environments may have difficulty reporting data to New Relic; for example: Hybrid mobile applications Applications installed on unusual hardware, such as point-of-sale terminals or consumer appliances For more information, review the instrumentation for browser monitoring documentation, and verify end-user network access. Browser types Instrumentation is compatible with every browser type, including Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox, Microsoft Internet Explorer and Edge, and Apple Safari. The user interface is compatible with New Relic's supported browser versions. Exceptions Comments Paint timings The firstPaint and firstContentfulPaint attributes in BrowserInteraction, PageView, and PageViewTiming events are only compatible with: Chrome 60 or higher for desktop and mobile (Android webview and Chrome for Android) Opera 47 or higher for desktop Opera 44 or higher for Android mobile Samsung Internet for mobile AJAX AJAX timing features are not available with: Chrome for iPhone and iPad IE 7 and 8 PageAction events PageAction events require a browser that fully supports cross-domain XMLHttpRequests. Internet Explorer versions 9 and lower cannot record PageAction events. Learn more on querying your data. Session traces Session traces are reported only from browsers that support the Resource Timing Specification. SHA-256 New Relic can only monitor browsers that are compatible with SHA-256. APM agents You can deploy the browser agent for apps monitored by APM, or you can deploy the browser agent for your standalone apps. For more information, see the installation procedures. If you are deploying browser for an app using APM, make sure your agent supports browser monitoring: C SDK: Version 1.0.0 or higher Go: Version 2.5.0 or higher Java: Version 3.4.0 or higher .NET: Version 2.20.25.0 or higher Node.js: Version 1.4.0 or higher PHP: Version 4.4.5.35 or higher Python: Version 2.10.1.9 or higher Ruby: Version 3.7.0.177 or higher Supported frameworks The browser agent collects data on all front-end frameworks. However, the monitoring occurs on lower-level \"primitives\" that JavaScript frameworks use, so the level of detail collected by the instrumentation may vary depending on your specific framework. Exceptions Comments Zone.js If you're using AngularJS and you want to use our SPA monitoring features, note that Zone.js versions 0.6.18 to 0.6.24 are not compatible with browser. In all cases, the browser agent must be loaded before Zone.js to avoid errors. Cypress.io Browser is unable to properly instrument the open and send methods of requests when tests are run in Cypress. This will cause the following error to be thrown: Cannot set property 'status' of undefined Copy This will only affect customers running tests with the Browser agent present in their code. Production applications should not be affected. html2pdf.js This library is not compatible with our Pro+SPA agent due to the way this library wraps promises. If you're using this library, we recommend selecting the Pro agent type. Content Security Policy (CSP) considerations In order to obtain accurate browser performance metrics, browser requires the use of a small, inline JavaScript snippet. New Relic carefully reviews the inline JavaScript to prevent Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) and other potential vulnerabilities. Content Security Policy Level 2 adds restrictions to the types of JavaScript allowed, such as inline scripts. It also limits which domains can load scripts during page load. Important If your website does not allow any third-party hosted JavaScript to run, you must request a CSP exception via your organization’s standard procedures in order to install the browser monitoring agent. When requesting a CSP exception, follow your organization's standard procedures to contact your web or security team. The browser JavaScript agent requires the following CSP exceptions in order to run properly. Alternatively, you can add all of these exceptions to the fallback default-src directive (instead of script-src and connect-src). CSP exception Comments unsafe-inline Add to the script-src directive or to the fallback default-src directive. This is required because the agent is installed by including an inline script. https://js-agent.newrelic.com Add to the script-src directive or to the fallback default-src directive. This is where additional script files that the agent requires are hosted. https://bam.nr-data.net https://bam-cell.nr-data.net Important Add https://gov-bam.nr-data.net if you're using FedRAMP-compliant endpoints. Add to the script-src directive or to the fallback default-src directive. This is where the agent sends its collected data. One of the calls to this URL is a JSONP call, which means that the URL must be allowed as a script source. Add to the connect-src directive or to the fallback default-src directive. The connect-src directive affects the URLs that scripts can call (for example, using the XMLHttpRequest interface). If you have CSP restrictions specifically around this directive, then add this URL as an exception.",

Requirements Agent version nr-593 or higher. Description Adds a user-defined attribute name and value to subsequent events on the page. Make this call before the window load event fires (when that data is transmitted) in order for the attributes to be included in the PageView event. Once an attribute is set, New Relic One records it with all PageAction events until the page is reloaded or the attribute is manually unset. If you are using SPA monitoring with a compatible agent version, attributes set with this call will also be included in newrelic.interaction events. However, attributes set using the SPA API will take precedence over these attributes. Errors for custom attributes will be included in events on the JS Errors page. To view or log errors for a custom attribute via API, use the browser API's noticeError call. Parameters Parameter Description $name string Required. Name of the attribute. Appears as column in the PageView event. It will also appear as a column in the PageAction event if you are using it. Avoid using reserved NRQL words when you name the attribute/value. $value string OR integer Required. Value of the attribute. Appears as the value in the named attribute column in the PageView event. It will appear as a column in the PageAction event if you are using it. Custom attribute values cannot be complex objects, only simple types such as Strings and Integers. Avoid using reserved NRQL words when you name the attribute/value.

      "body": "Browser monitoring's PageViewTiming event sends each data point as a separate event as soon as it is available. Because we do not restrict the timing, you can receive first paint or first interaction data regardless of when it fires. This document describes why and how to use PageViewTiming and its attributes to query data about your site, component loading, and user performance metrics, both from visual and responsiveness standpoints. Why use PageViewTiming? If your application uses asynchronous or dynamic pages, you may need additional details about site or component loading. But pages can load content in many different ways, and users control when they interact with that content. This is why some user-centric performance metrics happen outside the standard window onload (page load time) in the browser agent. For example, users may become impatient and begin clicking as soon as content is on the webpage. Or, they may wait to use the page until long after content is loaded. The PageViewTiming event provides a more real-time delivery mechanism that does not have a dependency on any other event. The additional metrics can help you understand how users experience your site, both from visual and responsiveness standpoints. Support for Google's Core Web Vitals We now, with the release of agent version 1177, have full support for Google's Core Web Vitals for 2020. The metrics that make up Core Web Vitals will evolve over time. The current set for 2020 focuses on three aspects of the user experience—loading, interactivity, and visual stability—and includes the following metrics (and their respective thresholds): Core Web Vitals metrics include loading, interactivity, and visual stability. Largest Contentful Paint (LCP): measures loading performance. To provide a good user experience, LCP should occur within 2.5 seconds of when the page first starts loading. First Input Delay (FID): measures interactivity. To provide a good user experience, pages should have a FID of less than 100 milliseconds. Cumulative Layout Shift (CLS): measures visual stability. To provide a good user experience, pages should maintain a CLS of less than 0.1. For each of the above metrics, to ensure you're hitting the recommended target for most of your users, a good threshold to measure is the 75th percentile of page loads, segmented across mobile and desktop devices. To learn more, watch our Nerd Days talk on perceived performance. Detailed visual, interactivity, and responsiveness metrics The BrowserInteraction and PageView events end their reporting when they receive the page window load (or window load and AJAX) timing. However, paint and interactivity metrics can happen at any time. PageViewTiming delivers these metrics as a separate event to: Account for the variability in this timing. Avoid setting an arbitrary timeout. Prevent holding BrowserInteraction and PageView events indefinitely. Additional data Comments firstPaint and firstContentfulPaint The firstPaint and firstContentfulPaint attributes already are available with BrowserInteraction and PageView events. However, they are not always reliably captured before the window onload event fires. Using PageViewTiming gives you a way to capture these metrics even if they happen after the original page load time. This gives you a better understanding of the correlation between responsiveness of that load event and the visual rendering of your content. largestContentfulPaint This new metric, available with agent version 1163, largestContentfulPaint, reports the render time of the largest content element visible in the viewport. Google's research found looking at when the largest element was rendered was a more accurate way to measure when the main content of a page is loaded and useful. Details on this metric, including limitations and considerations can be found in the w3c draft. In addition, we now report the cumulative layout shift (CLS) score attribute with LCP. This attribute is reported as cumulativeLayoutShift. Largest Contentful Paint is one of three metrics identified by Google as the Core Web Vitals. LCP values up to 2.5 secs are considered \"Good\", between 2.5-4.0 secs considered \"Needs Improvement\", and above 4.0 secs considered \"Poor.\" firstInteraction and firstInputDelay With the addition of firstInteraction and firstInputDelay, you can quickly determine the ways that your users are interacting with that visual content. These metrics tell you not only when they interacted, but what type of interaction (mousedown, pointerdown, etc.) and how long it took for them to receive a response from your site. The firstInputDelay metric lies in the middle of FirstContentfulPaint and Time to Interactive (TTI) metrics, measuring the time between when a first input can be made and when the browser's main thread is able to respond to any interactions. In addition, we now report the cumulative layout shift (CLS) score attribute at the moment of the user's first interaction. This attribute is reported as cumulativeLayoutShift. First Input Delay is one of three metrics identified by Google as the Core Web Vitals. FID values up to 100 ms are considered \"Good\", between 100-300 ms considered \"Needs Improvement\", and above 300 ms considered \"Poor.\" For a more detailed explanation, see the Browser release notes. cumulativeLayoutShift Cumulative Layout Shift (CLS), available with agent v1177, is an important, user-centric metric for measuring visual stability because it helps quantify how often users experience unexpected layout shifts—a low CLS helps ensure that the page is delightful. This is one of three metrics identified by Google as the Core Web Vitals. Cumulative Layout Shift is one of three metrics identified by Google as the Core Web Vitals. CLS scores up to 0.1 are considered \"Good\", between 0.1-0.25 considered \"Needs Improvement\", and above 0.25 considered \"Poor.\" timingName You can review different types of activities with the timingName attribute, such as firstPaint, firstContentfulPaint, firstInteraction, largestContentfulPaint, pageHide and windowUnload. For example, a PageViewTiming event may have a timingName of firstPaint and a firstPaint value of .03. The event will also include all default attributes included with the standard BrowserInteraction and PageView events. elementId This is the Id, if specified, of the largestContentfulPaint element. This value will only be reported with the LCP metric. This value can be null. elementSize This is the reported size of the largestContentfulPaint element. This value will only be reported with the LCP metric. pageHide The pageHide event, available with agent v1177, is sent when the browser hides the current page in the process of presenting a different page from the session's history. For example, when the user clicks the browser's Back button, the current page receives a pageHide event before the previous page is shown. Supporting documentation and browser compatibility for the pageHide event can be found in MDN docs. In addition, we now report the cumulative layout shift (CLS) score attribute with pageHide. This attribute is reported as cumulativeLayoutShift. windowLoad The windowLoad event, available with agent v1177, is fired when the whole page has loaded, including all dependent resources such as stylesheets and images. Supporting documentation and browser compatibility for the Window Load event can be found in MDN docs. In addition, we now report the cumulative layout shift (CLS) score attribute with windowLoad. This attribute is reported as cumulativeLayoutShift. windowUnload The windowUnload event, available with agent v1163, is fired when a document or child resource is being unloaded. Supporting documentation and browser compatibility for the Window Unload event can be found in MDN docs. In addition, we now report the cumulative layout shift (CLS) score attribute with windowUnload. This attribute is reported as cumulativeLayoutShift. Compatibility and requirements Requirements: Meets install requirements Reporting of this event requires browser agent version 1153 or higher and a Pro or Pro+SPA agent. Follow our Browser agent release notes to find out when new metrics are released. These metrics are supported by the following browser versions. For unsupported browsers, no PageViewTiming events will be recorded. Metrics Supported browser versions cumulativeLayoutShift Chrome 79 Metric is elevated to stable; changes in metric definition will be reported in this log. Chrome 77 Metric exposed via API: Cumulative Layout Shift available via Layout Instability API firstPaint firstContentfulPaint Chrome 60 or higher for desktop and mobile (Android webview and Chrome for Android) Opera 47 or higher for desktop Opera 44 or higher for Android mobile Samsung Internet for mobile largestContentfulPaint Chrome 77 or higher for desktop and mobile firstInteraction firstInputDelay These metrics require the addEventListener browser API. This API is available in all modern browsers, including: Apple Safari Google Chrome Microsoft Internet Explorer (IE) versions 9 or higher Mozilla Firefox pageHide This metric is currently supported by all browsers on desktop and mobile.

If a user navigates from a site without page load timing to a site with page load timing (for example, to the first page on your page load timing-enabled site), special considerations for navigation start time arise. Contents Network estimate The page load timing JavaScript utility file creates a cookie with the navigation start time when a user leaves a page (by hooking an event, beforeunload, or pagehide, depending on the browser). However, when navigating away from a site without page load timing enabled, the JavaScript code will not be present, and the cookie will not be created. Then, when the user hits the first page of a site, the navigation start time cannot be determined, because there is no cookie. In this case the browser agent has all the data (queue time, app time, DOM content and rendering time) except network time. Navigation start time is required to compute network time. Rather than toss the data, the page load timing feature estimates the network time based on recently accumulated averages for your application, regionally. This way the page load timing feature provides a more accurate throughput measurement, and the rest of the data is retained. This is especially important for sites with a high bounce rate (when users visit only one page). The more visitors you have from different regions, the more accurate the network estimate will be. Network estimate unavailable If a network estimate is not available for your application and for the region where the hit originated, the page load timing process reverts to a network estimate across all reporting apps for the region. Failing that, the data is tossed. Note: For browsers that have the Navigation Timing API, this is not an issue, as the navigation start time can be determined without using a cookie.

      "body": "This document explains: How a web page loads How browser monitoring measures page load timing, also known as real user monitoring (RUM) Tip This is a description of traditional, synchronous page load timing. Browser can also monitor asynchronous page load timing. Page load process Here are the major steps in the loading of most web pages. The numbers 1-6 in the diagram correspond to the numbered steps below. Page load timeline: The steps involved in a web page load. Browser monitoring charts display the following segments of that process: Network, Web application, DOM processing, and Page rendering. A page load begins when a user selects a hyperlink, submits a form, or types a URL in a browser. This is also referred to as the initial request or the navigation start. The user's action sends a request across the network to the web application server. The request reaches the application for processing. (The request may take some time to start being processed. This could be the result of request queuing or it could be other factors.) The app finishes processing and sends an HTML response back across the network to the user's browser. This is sometimes referred to as response start or first byte. The user's browser receives the HTML response and starts to process the Document Object Model, or DOM. The DOM finishes loading; this point is known as DOM ready. Using the DOM, the user's browser starts to render the page. The page finishes rendering in the user's browser and the window load event fires. (For pages that use asynchronous loading, some elements may continue to load after the window load event occurs.) Page load time charts in browser monitoring Browser monitoring captures the major page load timing segments in the browser Summary page and the Page views page. If you have SPA monitoring enabled, you will have access to both this chart and SPA-specific charts. The charts show: Network Web application time DOM processing Page rendering Other segments as applicable, such as request queuing The chart colors match the colors in the page load timing diagram. one.newrelic.com > Browser > (select an app) > Summary: The load time chart appears on the Summary and Page views page. The way browser collects these times depends on the browser's capability to use the Navigation Timing Specification API. You can add custom page load timing events with the browser agent API. Here are descriptions of the activity included in the browser load time chart segments: Web application The web application time includes the time spent on the application server. This can only be determined if the browser instrumentation for page load timing was provided by an APM agent. Network The Network layer includes time spent in redirects as well as in requesting and receiving HTML. It does not include time on the server or for static assets. Network time measurement starts from the initial click on a link. Network time includes DNS and may include more than one lookup if you have redirects on your site, TCP (including the firewall, unless you have configured request queue time monitoring), and SSL connect time. If you have configured request queue time monitoring, then the network time does not include any of the request queue time that occurs after the X-Request header. If you have not configured request queue time monitoring, then the network time does include all of the request queue time. The Navigation Timing Specification API provides a detailed breakdown of network time. (For old browsers, the timer starts on the \"before unload event.\") For apps that have been deployed using the copy/paste method, Browser includes web app and queue time in Network time. This is because browser relies on the server-side agent to pass the application values to the browser agent through auto-injection. For more information about how this back-end time breaks down from the browser's point of view, use the Session traces page. The session traces report on all the network related events available, so you can see on a case-by-case basis how the browser is spending time on DNS lookups and other network events. Important Even with request queuing configured, the front-end server's setup can still affect network time. This is because the front-end server does not add the queueing time header until after it actually accepts and processes the request. If the front-end server is configured in some way that causes requests to start backlogging and to queue up in the listener socket that the front-end server uses to accept connections, then you will see network time increase for browser monitoring. The queueing time headers can never account for backlog in this listener socket. DOM processing DOM processing is the time it takes to parse the HTML into a DOM and retrieve or execute synchronous scripts. If the browser starts to download images in this phase, page load timing will capture the image load time. The DOM processing and page rendering layers include network time for static assets (assets that are not explicitly retrieved after page load). However, if a script on the page dynamically inserts image tags and loads images after the server or content delivery system (CDN) finishes, page load timing cannot capture the image load time. Page rendering The Page rendering phase is the time between the DOM being complete and the window load event. This phase measures browser-side processing of the page content, and often includes time for scripts and static assets to load. Request queuing Request queuing will be displayed in the load time chart if your account has both browser and APM linked. In New Relic, request queuing refers to the time between a request entering your production systems and it reaching your application. Depending on the specifics of your production infrastructure, this time may include an actual queue that requests enter, or it may represent other functions that take time (such as load balancing or internal network latency). App server requests vs. browser transactions Often the number of app server transactions (requests per minute or rpm) is larger than the number of browser transactions (pages per minute or ppm) for the same application. For more information, see the troubleshooting procedures. Outliers No matter how well your application performs, there will be some slow browsers, platforms, and networks that make your overall aggregate response times appear slower. To minimize the skew caused by outliers, page load timing clamps and scales the end user response times that are greater than 4.5 times your application's browser Apdex T setting to 4.5 times the Apdex T, or to 13.5 seconds, whichever is greater. (Histogram outliers are cut off at 95%.) For example, if your application's end user Apdex T threshold is 8 seconds, those response times will be clamped at 36 seconds. This minimizes the impact of these response times on your overall application but still provides accounting for \"frustrated\" Apdex scores. For SPA monitoring, outliers are handled differently. When the duration of an initial page load or route change reaches 30 minutes, that event is treated as invalid data and is discarded.",

      "body": "Browser monitoring's PageViewTiming event sends each data point as a separate event as soon as it is available. Because we do not restrict the timing, you can receive first paint or first interaction data regardless of when it fires. This document describes why and how to use PageViewTiming and its attributes to query data about your site, component loading, and user performance metrics, both from visual and responsiveness standpoints. Why use PageViewTiming? If your application uses asynchronous or dynamic pages, you may need additional details about site or component loading. But pages can load content in many different ways, and users control when they interact with that content. This is why some user-centric performance metrics happen outside the standard window onload (page load time) in the browser agent. For example, users may become impatient and begin clicking as soon as content is on the webpage. Or, they may wait to use the page until long after content is loaded. The PageViewTiming event provides a more real-time delivery mechanism that does not have a dependency on any other event. The additional metrics can help you understand how users experience your site, both from visual and responsiveness standpoints. Support for Google's Core Web Vitals We now, with the release of agent version 1177, have full support for Google's Core Web Vitals for 2020. The metrics that make up Core Web Vitals will evolve over time. The current set for 2020 focuses on three aspects of the user experience—loading, interactivity, and visual stability—and includes the following metrics (and their respective thresholds): Core Web Vitals metrics include loading, interactivity, and visual stability. Largest Contentful Paint (LCP): measures loading performance. To provide a good user experience, LCP should occur within 2.5 seconds of when the page first starts loading. First Input Delay (FID): measures interactivity. To provide a good user experience, pages should have a FID of less than 100 milliseconds. Cumulative Layout Shift (CLS): measures visual stability. To provide a good user experience, pages should maintain a CLS of less than 0.1. For each of the above metrics, to ensure you're hitting the recommended target for most of your users, a good threshold to measure is the 75th percentile of page loads, segmented across mobile and desktop devices. To learn more, watch our Nerd Days talk on perceived performance. Detailed visual, interactivity, and responsiveness metrics The BrowserInteraction and PageView events end their reporting when they receive the page window load (or window load and AJAX) timing. However, paint and interactivity metrics can happen at any time. PageViewTiming delivers these metrics as a separate event to: Account for the variability in this timing. Avoid setting an arbitrary timeout. Prevent holding BrowserInteraction and PageView events indefinitely. Additional data Comments firstPaint and firstContentfulPaint The firstPaint and firstContentfulPaint attributes already are available with BrowserInteraction and PageView events. However, they are not always reliably captured before the window onload event fires. Using PageViewTiming gives you a way to capture these metrics even if they happen after the original page load time. This gives you a better understanding of the correlation between responsiveness of that load event and the visual rendering of your content. largestContentfulPaint This new metric, available with agent version 1163, largestContentfulPaint, reports the render time of the largest content element visible in the viewport. Google's research found looking at when the largest element was rendered was a more accurate way to measure when the main content of a page is loaded and useful. Details on this metric, including limitations and considerations can be found in the w3c draft. In addition, we now report the cumulative layout shift (CLS) score attribute with LCP. This attribute is reported as cumulativeLayoutShift. Largest Contentful Paint is one of three metrics identified by Google as the Core Web Vitals. LCP values up to 2.5 secs are considered \"Good\", between 2.5-4.0 secs considered \"Needs Improvement\", and above 4.0 secs considered \"Poor.\" firstInteraction and firstInputDelay With the addition of firstInteraction and firstInputDelay, you can quickly determine the ways that your users are interacting with that visual content. These metrics tell you not only when they interacted, but what type of interaction (mousedown, pointerdown, etc.) and how long it took for them to receive a response from your site. The firstInputDelay metric lies in the middle of FirstContentfulPaint and Time to Interactive (TTI) metrics, measuring the time between when a first input can be made and when the browser's main thread is able to respond to any interactions. In addition, we now report the cumulative layout shift (CLS) score attribute at the moment of the user's first interaction. This attribute is reported as cumulativeLayoutShift. First Input Delay is one of three metrics identified by Google as the Core Web Vitals. FID values up to 100 ms are considered \"Good\", between 100-300 ms considered \"Needs Improvement\", and above 300 ms considered \"Poor.\" For a more detailed explanation, see the Browser release notes. cumulativeLayoutShift Cumulative Layout Shift (CLS), available with agent v1177, is an important, user-centric metric for measuring visual stability because it helps quantify how often users experience unexpected layout shifts—a low CLS helps ensure that the page is delightful. This is one of three metrics identified by Google as the Core Web Vitals. Cumulative Layout Shift is one of three metrics identified by Google as the Core Web Vitals. CLS scores up to 0.1 are considered \"Good\", between 0.1-0.25 considered \"Needs Improvement\", and above 0.25 considered \"Poor.\" timingName You can review different types of activities with the timingName attribute, such as firstPaint, firstContentfulPaint, firstInteraction, largestContentfulPaint, pageHide and windowUnload. For example, a PageViewTiming event may have a timingName of firstPaint and a firstPaint value of .03. The event will also include all default attributes included with the standard BrowserInteraction and PageView events. elementId This is the Id, if specified, of the largestContentfulPaint element. This value will only be reported with the LCP metric. This value can be null. elementSize This is the reported size of the largestContentfulPaint element. This value will only be reported with the LCP metric. pageHide The pageHide event, available with agent v1177, is sent when the browser hides the current page in the process of presenting a different page from the session's history. For example, when the user clicks the browser's Back button, the current page receives a pageHide event before the previous page is shown. Supporting documentation and browser compatibility for the pageHide event can be found in MDN docs. In addition, we now report the cumulative layout shift (CLS) score attribute with pageHide. This attribute is reported as cumulativeLayoutShift. windowLoad The windowLoad event, available with agent v1177, is fired when the whole page has loaded, including all dependent resources such as stylesheets and images. Supporting documentation and browser compatibility for the Window Load event can be found in MDN docs. In addition, we now report the cumulative layout shift (CLS) score attribute with windowLoad. This attribute is reported as cumulativeLayoutShift. windowUnload The windowUnload event, available with agent v1163, is fired when a document or child resource is being unloaded. Supporting documentation and browser compatibility for the Window Unload event can be found in MDN docs. In addition, we now report the cumulative layout shift (CLS) score attribute with windowUnload. This attribute is reported as cumulativeLayoutShift. Compatibility and requirements Requirements: Meets install requirements Reporting of this event requires browser agent version 1153 or higher and a Pro or Pro+SPA agent. Follow our Browser agent release notes to find out when new metrics are released. These metrics are supported by the following browser versions. For unsupported browsers, no PageViewTiming events will be recorded. Metrics Supported browser versions cumulativeLayoutShift Chrome 79 Metric is elevated to stable; changes in metric definition will be reported in this log.

If a user navigates from a site without page load timing to a site with page load timing (for example, to the first page on your page load timing-enabled site), special considerations for navigation start time arise. Contents Network estimate The page load timing JavaScript utility file creates a cookie with the navigation start time when a user leaves a page (by hooking an event, beforeunload, or pagehide, depending on the browser). However, when navigating away from a site without page load timing enabled, the JavaScript code will not be present, and the cookie will not be created. Then, when the user hits the first page of a site, the navigation start time cannot be determined, because there is no cookie. In this case the browser agent has all the data (queue time, app time, DOM content and rendering time) except network time. Navigation start time is required to compute network time. Rather than toss the data, the page load timing feature estimates the network time based on recently accumulated averages for your application, regionally. This way the page load timing feature provides a more accurate throughput measurement, and the rest of the data is retained. This is especially important for sites with a high bounce rate (when users visit only one page). The more visitors you have from different regions, the more accurate the network estimate will be. Network estimate unavailable If a network estimate is not available for your application and for the region where the hit originated, the page load timing process reverts to a network estimate across all reporting apps for the region.

      "body": "This document explains: How a web page loads How browser monitoring measures page load timing, also known as real user monitoring (RUM) Tip This is a description of traditional, synchronous page load timing. Browser can also monitor asynchronous page load timing. Page load process Here are the major steps in the loading of most web pages. The numbers 1-6 in the diagram correspond to the numbered steps below. Page load timeline: The steps involved in a web page load. Browser monitoring charts display the following segments of that process: Network, Web application, DOM processing, and Page rendering. A page load begins when a user selects a hyperlink, submits a form, or types a URL in a browser. This is also referred to as the initial request or the navigation start. The user's action sends a request across the network to the web application server. The request reaches the application for processing. (The request may take some time to start being processed. This could be the result of request queuing or it could be other factors.) The app finishes processing and sends an HTML response back across the network to the user's browser. This is sometimes referred to as response start or first byte. The user's browser receives the HTML response and starts to process the Document Object Model, or DOM. The DOM finishes loading; this point is known as DOM ready. Using the DOM, the user's browser starts to render the page. The page finishes rendering in the user's browser and the window load event fires. (For pages that use asynchronous loading, some elements may continue to load after the window load event occurs.) Page load time charts in browser monitoring Browser monitoring captures the major page load timing segments in the browser Summary page and the Page views page. If you have SPA monitoring enabled, you will have access to both this chart and SPA-specific charts. The charts show: Network Web application time DOM processing Page rendering Other segments as applicable, such as request queuing The chart colors match the colors in the page load timing diagram. one.newrelic.com > Browser > (select an app) > Summary: The load time chart appears on the Summary and Page views page. The way browser collects these times depends on the browser's capability to use the Navigation Timing Specification API. You can add custom page load timing events with the browser agent API. Here are descriptions of the activity included in the browser load time chart segments: Web application The web application time includes the time spent on the application server. This can only be determined if the browser instrumentation for page load timing was provided by an APM agent. Network The Network layer includes time spent in redirects as well as in requesting and receiving HTML. It does not include time on the server or for static assets. Network time measurement starts from the initial click on a link. Network time includes DNS and may include more than one lookup if you have redirects on your site, TCP (including the firewall, unless you have configured request queue time monitoring), and SSL connect time. If you have configured request queue time monitoring, then the network time does not include any of the request queue time that occurs after the X-Request header. If you have not configured request queue time monitoring, then the network time does include all of the request queue time. The Navigation Timing Specification API provides a detailed breakdown of network time. (For old browsers, the timer starts on the \"before unload event.\") For apps that have been deployed using the copy/paste method, Browser includes web app and queue time in Network time. This is because browser relies on the server-side agent to pass the application values to the browser agent through auto-injection. For more information about how this back-end time breaks down from the browser's point of view, use the Session traces page. The session traces report on all the network related events available, so you can see on a case-by-case basis how the browser is spending time on DNS lookups and other network events. Important Even with request queuing configured, the front-end server's setup can still affect network time. This is because the front-end server does not add the queueing time header until after it actually accepts and processes the request. If the front-end server is configured in some way that causes requests to start backlogging and to queue up in the listener socket that the front-end server uses to accept connections, then you will see network time increase for browser monitoring. The queueing time headers can never account for backlog in this listener socket. DOM processing DOM processing is the time it takes to parse the HTML into a DOM and retrieve or execute synchronous scripts. If the browser starts to download images in this phase, page load timing will capture the image load time. The DOM processing and page rendering layers include network time for static assets (assets that are not explicitly retrieved after page load). However, if a script on the page dynamically inserts image tags and loads images after the server or content delivery system (CDN) finishes, page load timing cannot capture the image load time. Page rendering The Page rendering phase is the time between the DOM being complete and the window load event. This phase measures browser-side processing of the page content, and often includes time for scripts and static assets to load. Request queuing Request queuing will be displayed in the load time chart if your account has both browser and APM linked. In New Relic, request queuing refers to the time between a request entering your production systems and it reaching your application. Depending on the specifics of your production infrastructure, this time may include an actual queue that requests enter, or it may represent other functions that take time (such as load balancing or internal network latency). App server requests vs. browser transactions Often the number of app server transactions (requests per minute or rpm) is larger than the number of browser transactions (pages per minute or ppm) for the same application. For more information, see the troubleshooting procedures. Outliers No matter how well your application performs, there will be some slow browsers, platforms, and networks that make your overall aggregate response times appear slower. To minimize the skew caused by outliers, page load timing clamps and scales the end user response times that are greater than 4.5 times your application's browser Apdex T setting to 4.5 times the Apdex T, or to 13.5 seconds, whichever is greater. (Histogram outliers are cut off at 95%.) For example, if your application's end user Apdex T threshold is 8 seconds, those response times will be clamped at 36 seconds. This minimizes the impact of these response times on your overall application but still provides accounting for \"frustrated\" Apdex scores. For SPA monitoring, outliers are handled differently. When the duration of an initial page load or route change reaches 30 minutes, that event is treated as invalid data and is discarded.",

Before you install the browser agent, make sure your system meets these requirements. Want to try out our browser monitoring? Create a New Relic account for free! No credit card required. Basic requirements To report data to browser, your application must at a minimum meet two basic requirements: The traffic to the application must be from clients able to load and execute browser JavaScript code and set cookies. Clients accessing the application must be able to send data to New Relic through HTTP requests. HTTPS is required for browser Pro features. Important Browsers that subscribe to a disconnect list or that use content filtering extensions such as AdBlock may not be able to send data to New Relic. For example, if you are using the Enhanced Tracking Prevention disconnect list for Mozilla Firefox 69.0 or higher, you will need to change the default configuration. Most typical browser applications meet these requirements. However, browser applications in restricted environments may have difficulty reporting data to New Relic; for example: Hybrid mobile applications Applications installed on unusual hardware, such as point-of-sale terminals or consumer appliances For more information, review the instrumentation for browser monitoring documentation, and verify end-user network access. Browser types Instrumentation is compatible with every browser type, including Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox, Microsoft Internet Explorer and Edge, and Apple Safari. The user interface is compatible with New Relic's supported browser versions. Exceptions Comments Paint timings The firstPaint and firstContentfulPaint attributes in BrowserInteraction, PageView, and PageViewTiming events are only compatible with: Chrome 60 or higher for desktop and mobile (Android webview and Chrome for Android) Opera 47 or higher for desktop Opera 44 or higher for Android mobile Samsung Internet for mobile AJAX AJAX timing features are not available with: Chrome for iPhone and iPad IE 7 and 8 PageAction events PageAction events require a browser that fully supports cross-domain XMLHttpRequests. Internet Explorer versions 9 and lower cannot record PageAction events. Learn more on querying your data. Session traces Session traces are reported only from browsers that support the Resource Timing Specification. SHA-256 New Relic can only monitor browsers that are compatible with SHA-256. APM agents You can deploy the browser agent for apps monitored by APM, or you can deploy the browser agent for your standalone apps. For more information, see the installation procedures. If you are deploying browser for an app using APM, make sure your agent supports browser monitoring: C SDK: Version 1.0.0 or higher Go: Version 2.5.0 or higher Java: Version 3.4.0 or higher .NET: Version 2.20.25.0 or higher Node.js: Version 1.4.0 or higher PHP: Version 4.4.5.35 or higher Python: Version 2.10.1.9 or higher Ruby: Version 3.7.0.177 or higher Supported frameworks The browser agent collects data on all front-end frameworks. However, the monitoring occurs on lower-level \"primitives\" that JavaScript frameworks use, so the level of detail collected by the instrumentation may vary depending on your specific framework. Exceptions Comments Zone.js If you're using AngularJS and you want to use our SPA monitoring features, note that Zone.js versions 0.6.18 to 0.6.24 are not compatible with browser. In all cases, the browser agent must be loaded before Zone.js to avoid errors. Cypress.io Browser is unable to properly instrument the open and send methods of requests when tests are run in Cypress. This will cause the following error to be thrown: Cannot set property 'status' of undefined Copy This will only affect customers running tests with the Browser agent present in their code. Production applications should not be affected. html2pdf.js This library is not compatible with our Pro+SPA agent due to the way this library wraps promises. If you're using this library, we recommend selecting the Pro agent type. Content Security Policy (CSP) considerations In order to obtain accurate browser performance metrics, browser requires the use of a small, inline JavaScript snippet. New Relic carefully reviews the inline JavaScript to prevent Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) and other potential vulnerabilities. Content Security Policy Level 2 adds restrictions to the types of JavaScript allowed, such as inline scripts. It also limits which domains can load scripts during page load. Important If your website does not allow any third-party hosted JavaScript to run, you must request a CSP exception via your organization’s standard procedures in order to install the browser monitoring agent. When requesting a CSP exception, follow your organization's standard procedures to contact your web or security team. The browser JavaScript agent requires the following CSP exceptions in order to run properly. Alternatively, you can add all of these exceptions to the fallback default-src directive (instead of script-src and connect-src). CSP exception Comments unsafe-inline Add to the script-src directive or to the fallback default-src directive. This is required because the agent is installed by including an inline script. https://js-agent.newrelic.com Add to the script-src directive or to the fallback default-src directive. This is where additional script files that the agent requires are hosted. https://bam.nr-data.net https://bam-cell.nr-data.net Important Add https://gov-bam.nr-data.net if you're using FedRAMP-compliant endpoints. Add to the script-src directive or to the fallback default-src directive. This is where the agent sends its collected data. One of the calls to this URL is a JSONP call, which means that the URL must be allowed as a script source. Add to the connect-src directive or to the fallback default-src directive. The connect-src directive affects the URLs that scripts can call (for example, using the XMLHttpRequest interface). If you have CSP restrictions specifically around this directive, then add this URL as an exception.",

      "body": "Your end-user experience depends on your entire technology stack. You need to quickly understand what's causing a customer complaint or issue. Did the problem come from your infrastructure, your application, or the browsers that ultimately render it? Is it the result of a problematic internet provider, a problem in your own data center with failing CPU or memory, or something else? More than Real User Monitoring (RUM) Many websites contain dynamic content that is loaded after the initial page has finished loading, and complex JavaScript code increases the need for error reporting. Browser monitoring in New Relic One provides a Real User Monitoring (RUM) solution that measures the speed and performance of your end users as they navigate to your site from different web browsers, devices, operating systems, and networks. With browser monitoring in New Relic One, you see actionable data about your end users' experience with your app. But browser monitoring in New Relic goes far beyond the initial page load to measure full page life cycle data. For example, our browser UI shows you: Actual performance data, such as by page view popularity and user satisfaction (Apdex) scores Perceived performance data that measures how quickly your async or dynamic visuals and interactive page contents display JavaScript error analytics, stack traces, and line-of-code visibility, to show you the end-user steps leading up to an error itself Session performance with a detailed timeline and heat map of the load and interaction events during a webpage's full life cycle AJAX requests indicating problems with timing, end points, and specific locations in the webpage Hash-based route changes in apps with single-page application (SPA) architectures These tools (and more!) help your teams optimize your end users' page load experience, eliminate bugs, and troubleshoot faster across your full stack. Examine user perceptions Real user data gives insights into actual page performance, but you also need to look into your users' perception of your site's performance. Pages can load content in many different ways, and users control when they interact with that content. This is why some user-centric performance metrics happen outside the standard window onload (page load time) in the browser monitoring agent. The PageViewTiming event provides a more real-time delivery mechanism that does not have a dependency on any other event. Additional metrics include: First paint, first contentful paint, and largest contentful paint First input delay First interaction This helps you understand how users experience your site, both from visual and responsiveness standpoints. Improve interactive app performance Our single-page app (SPA) monitoring automatically tracks route changes, initial page loads, and synchronous and asynchronous activity during browser interactions. You can also use our browser agent and SPA API to monitor virtually anything that executes inside the browser. If you are a developer, SPA monitoring can help you: Create faster, more responsive, highly interactive apps. Monitor the throughput and performance that real users are experiencing. Troubleshoot and resolve problems within the context of the page load. Query and visualize the data to assist with business decisions. Bring better apps to the marketplace more quickly. Correlate front-end and back-end problems With New Relic One, you can instrument any type of data you need, such as metrics, events, logs, and traces. This helps you find actionable data about your end users' experience across the stack. For example: Full-Stack Observability Comments Locations or domains Limit browser monitoring to focus on specific geographical locations or specific types of end-user activity. You can also monitor or block specific domains. Trends in interactions Use our comparative charting feature for a direct page load time comparison between real user (browser) interactions and trends appearing in Synthetic monitors. Distributed tracing Isolate latency from the web browser through back-end services with distributed tracing. The UI helps you see the connection across across a full transaction, from browser activity, to time spent in network, to back-end activity. Browser types Explore your end users' experience with your app segmented by any types of browsers they use, including: Top browsers by throughput Average page load time by platform type (mobile, desktop, and other) Selected browser type by version (for example, Chrome 31, 32, 33, etc.) This helps you quickly determine whether problems with page load timing may be related to a specific browser type or platform, or whether the problem is more widespread. Get started with browser monitoring Follow these basic steps, and you'll quickly be up and running in New Relic with browser monitoring! Review the compatibility details and basic requirements for browser monitoring. Install the browser agent. Go to [one.newrelic.com > Explorer > Browser applications. Use the Explorer to access all your entities, that is, anything we can identify that reports data, from applications and hosts to custom groupings of any elements. View summary data from your Browser summary page, then drill down into page load timing details and other UI data. Configure your alerts for key performance data, or use our Applied Intelligence solutions to reduce alert noise, correlate incidents, and automatically detect anomalies. Query and visualize your default data (or customize your own), then analyze what that data says about your business. Customize and share your own charts and dashboards.",

Requirements Agent version nr-593 or higher. Description Adds a user-defined attribute name and value to subsequent events on the page. Make this call before the window load event fires (when that data is transmitted) in order for the attributes to be included in the PageView event. Once an attribute is set, New Relic One records it with all PageAction events until the page is reloaded or the attribute is manually unset. If you are using SPA monitoring with a compatible agent version, attributes set with this call will also be included in newrelic.interaction events. However, attributes set using the SPA API will take precedence over these attributes. Errors for custom attributes will be included in events on the JS Errors page. To view or log errors for a custom attribute via API, use the browser API's noticeError call. Parameters Parameter Description $name string Required. Name of the attribute. Appears as column in the PageView event. It will also appear as a column in the PageAction event if you are using it. Avoid using reserved NRQL words when you name the attribute/value. $value string OR integer Required. Value of the attribute. Appears as the value in the named attribute column in the PageView event. It will appear as a column in the PageAction event if you are using it. Custom attribute values cannot be complex objects, only simple types such as Strings and Integers. Avoid using reserved NRQL words when you name the attribute/value. Examples Get JavaScript/jQuery for HTML elements This example uses JavaScript/jQuery to get the values of the following HTML elements on a Drupal-generated page: <link rel=\"shortlink\" href=\"/node/1111\" /> <h1>Using NRQL</h1> New Relic reports them as custom attributes. This is useful to query PageView and PageAction events in New Relic One. var node_id = ''; node_id= jQuery(\"link[rel='shortlink']\").attr(\"href\"); var node_title = ''; node_title= jQuery('h1').text(); if (typeof newrelic == 'object') { newrelic.setCustomAttribute('nodeId', node_id); newrelic.setCustomAttribute('title', node_title); } Copy",

Requirements Agent version nr-963 or higher. Description This SPA monitoring method sets the name and trigger of a browser interaction. The name will be exposed as the browserInteractionName attribute in the BrowserInteraction event. It will also be used for grouping in the UI. By default, browserInteractionName is named after an associated URL or route. Use setName() when you want to record an interaction that is not a route change or URL change.

The previousRouteName and targetRouteName attributes are still set with values passed to setCurrentRouteName(). Using these methods together allows many options for filtering and grouping in the UI. For example, you can: Filter down to interactions of a certain type, such as LikeButtonClick. Then, group by targetRouteName to see what routes have the most LikeButtonClick interactions.

However, attributes set using the SPA API will take precedence over these attributes. Errors for custom attributes will be included in events on the JS Errors page. To view or log errors for a custom attribute via API, use the browser API's noticeError call. Parameters Parameter Description $name string Required. Name of the attribute. Appears as column in the PageView event. It will also appear as a column in the PageAction event if you are using it. Avoid using reserved NRQL words when you name the attribute/value. $value string OR integer Required. Value of the attribute. Appears as the value in the named attribute column in the PageView event. It will appear as a column in the PageAction event if you are using it. Custom attribute values cannot be complex objects, only simple types such as Strings and Integers. Avoid using reserved NRQL words when you name the attribute/value. Examples Get JavaScript/jQuery for HTML elements This example uses JavaScript/jQuery to get the values of the following HTML elements on a Drupal-generated page: <link rel=\"shortlink\" href=\"/node/1111\" /> <h1>Using NRQL</h1> New Relic reports them as custom attributes. This is useful to query PageView and PageAction events in New Relic One. var node_id = ''; node_id= jQuery(\"link[rel='shortlink']\").attr(\"href\"); var node_title = ''; node_title= jQuery('h1').text(); if (typeof newrelic == 'object') { newrelic.setCustomAttribute('nodeId', node_id); newrelic.setCustomAttribute('title', node_title); } Copy",

The name will be exposed as the browserInteractionName attribute in the BrowserInteraction event. It will also be used for grouping in the UI. By default, browserInteractionName is named after an associated URL or route. Use setName() when you want to record an interaction that is not a route change or URL change.

Requirements Agent version nr-963 or higher. Description This SPA monitoring method sets the name and trigger of a browser interaction. The name will be exposed as the browserInteractionName attribute in the BrowserInteraction event. It will also be used for grouping in the UI. By default, browserInteractionName is named after an associated URL or route. Use setName() when you want to record an interaction that is not a route change or URL change. The setCurrentRouteName() method also names the current route. When you use both: setName() takes precedence for naming the interaction. The previousRouteName and targetRouteName attributes are still set with values passed to setCurrentRouteName(). Using these methods together allows many options for filtering and grouping in the UI. For example, you can: Filter down to interactions of a certain type, such as LikeButtonClick. Then, group by targetRouteName to see what routes have the most LikeButtonClick interactions. Tip This API call applies to data in SPA page views in browser and the BrowserInteraction event type within New Relic One. To set a custom name for standard page views and the PageView event type, see setPageViewName. Using both calls together is recommended. Parameters Parameter Description $name string Required. If null, the name will be set using the targetGroupedUrl attribute. If not null, this will set the browserInteractionName attribute in the BrowserInteraction event. $trigger string Optional. If not null, this will set the TRIGGER attribute on the BrowserInteraction event. Return values This method returns the same API object created by interaction().

Requirements Agent version nr-963 or higher. Description This SPA monitoring method sets the name and trigger of a browser interaction. The name will be exposed as the browserInteractionName attribute in the BrowserInteraction event. It will also be used for grouping in the UI. By default, browserInteractionName is named after an associated URL or route. Use setName() when you want to record an interaction that is not a route change or URL change. The setCurrentRouteName() method also names the current route. When you use both: setName() takes precedence for naming the interaction. The previousRouteName and targetRouteName attributes are still set with values passed to setCurrentRouteName(). Using these methods together allows many options for filtering and grouping in the UI. For example, you can: Filter down to interactions of a certain type, such as LikeButtonClick. Then, group by targetRouteName to see what routes have the most LikeButtonClick interactions. Tip This API call applies to data in SPA page views in browser and the BrowserInteraction event type within New Relic One. To set a custom name for standard page views and the PageView event type, see setPageViewName. Using both calls together is recommended. Parameters Parameter Description $name string Required. If null, the name will be set using the targetGroupedUrl attribute. If not null, this will set the browserInteractionName attribute in the BrowserInteraction event. $trigger string Optional. If not null, this will set the TRIGGER attribute on the BrowserInteraction event. Return values This method returns the same API object created by interaction().

The setCurrentRouteName() method also names the current route. When you use both: setName() takes precedence for naming the interaction. The previousRouteName and targetRouteName attributes are still set with values passed to setCurrentRouteName(). Using these methods together allows many options for filtering and grouping in the UI. For example, you can: Filter down to interactions of a certain type, such as LikeButtonClick. Then, group by targetRouteName to see what routes have the most LikeButtonClick interactions. Tip This API call applies to data in SPA page views in browser and the BrowserInteraction event type within New Relic One. To set a custom name for standard page views and the PageView event type, see setPageViewName. Using both calls together is recommended. Parameters Parameter Description $name string Required. If null, the name will be set using the targetGroupedUrl attribute. If not null, this will set the browserInteractionName attribute in the BrowserInteraction event. $trigger string Optional. If not null, this will set the TRIGGER attribute on the BrowserInteraction event. Return values This method returns the same API object created by interaction().

      "body": "Syntax newrelic.interaction().setName(string $name[, string $trigger]) Copy Sets the name and trigger of a SPA's browser interaction that is not a route change or URL change. Requirements Agent version nr-963 or higher. Description This SPA monitoring method sets the name and trigger of a browser interaction. The name will be exposed as the browserInteractionName attribute in the BrowserInteraction event. It will also be used for grouping in the UI. By default, browserInteractionName is named after an associated URL or route. Use setName() when you want to record an interaction that is not a route change or URL change. The setCurrentRouteName() method also names the current route. When you use both: setName() takes precedence for naming the interaction. The previousRouteName and targetRouteName attributes are still set with values passed to setCurrentRouteName(). Using these methods together allows many options for filtering and grouping in the UI. For example, you can: Filter down to interactions of a certain type, such as LikeButtonClick. Then, group by targetRouteName to see what routes have the most LikeButtonClick interactions. Tip This API call applies to data in SPA page views in browser and the BrowserInteraction event type within New Relic One. To set a custom name for standard page views and the PageView event type, see setPageViewName. Using both calls together is recommended. Parameters Parameter Description $name string Required. If null, the name will be set using the targetGroupedUrl attribute. If not null, this will set the browserInteractionName attribute in the BrowserInteraction event. $trigger string Optional. If not null, this will set the TRIGGER attribute on the BrowserInteraction event. Return values This method returns the same API object created by interaction().

The name will be exposed as the browserInteractionName attribute in the BrowserInteraction event. It will also be used for grouping in the UI. By default, browserInteractionName is named after an associated URL or route. Use setName() when you want to record an interaction that is not a route change or URL change.

The previousRouteName and targetRouteName attributes are still set with values passed to setCurrentRouteName(). Using these methods together allows many options for filtering and grouping in the UI. For example, you can: Filter down to interactions of a certain type, such as LikeButtonClick. Then, group by targetRouteName to see what routes have the most LikeButtonClick interactions.

Make this call before the window load event fires (when that data is transmitted) in order for the attributes to be included in the PageView event. Once an attribute is set, New Relic One records it with all PageAction events until the page is reloaded or the attribute is manually unset. If you are using SPA monitoring with a compatible agent version, attributes set with this call will also be included in newrelic.interaction events. However, attributes set using the SPA API will take precedence over these attributes. Errors for custom attributes will be included in events on the JS Errors page. To view or log errors for a custom attribute via API, use the browser API's noticeError call. Parameters Parameter Description $name string Required. Name of the attribute. Appears as column in the PageView event. It will also appear as a column in the PageAction event if you are using it. Avoid using reserved NRQL words when you name the attribute/value. $value string OR integer Required. Value of the attribute. Appears as the value in the named attribute column in the PageView event.

Here are some causes and solutions when you have problems finding expected data in the distributed tracing UI: Problems with enabling or instrumenting Missing spans due to service not having distributed tracing enabled In order for distributed tracing to report details for all nodes in a trace, each application must be monitored by a New Relic agent that has had distributed tracing enabled. If an application's New Relic account has not had distributed tracing enabled, it will have these issues: Its distributed tracing UI page won't have data. It won't report data to other accounts' distributed traces. Missing apps/services may require manual instrumentation When you enable distributed tracing for applications and services that New Relic automatically instruments, you'll usually see complete and detailed data for those nodes in the distributed tracing UI. However, you may notice that some services or applications are missing from traces, or that there are some internal spans you expect to see that are missing. If that's the case, you may want to implement custom instrumentation of applications or specific transactions to see more detail in traces. Some examples of when you may need to do this: Transactions not automatically instrumented. To ensure your application is automatically instrumented, read the compatibility and requirements documentation for the New Relic agent you're using. If an application isn't automatically instrumented, or if you'd like to add instrumentation of specific activity, see Custom instrumentation. All Go applications. The Go agent, unlike other agents, requires manual instrumentation of your code. For instructions, see Instrument a Go application. A service doesn't use HTTP. If a service doesn't communicate via HTTP, the New Relic agent won't send distributed tracing headers. This may be the case for some non-web applications or message queues. To remedy this, use the distributed tracing APIs to instrument either the calling or called application. Problems with spans Infinite Tracing: missing spans If your APM agent can’t write data fast enough to the trace observer, queue_size is an additional APM agent configuration to limit the number of spans the agent will hold. See the following examples for your agent: .NET configuration method Example Configuration file <configuration . . . > <infiniteTracing> <trace_observer> <span_events queue_size=\"100000\" /> </trace_observer> </infiniteTracing> </configuration> Copy Environment variable NEW_RELIC_INFINITE_TRACING_SPAN_EVENTS_QUEUE_SIZE=100000 Copy Python configuration method Example Configuration file infinite_tracing.span_queue_size = 100000 Environment Variable NEW_RELIC_INFINITE_TRACING_SPAN_QUEUE_SIZE = 100000 Missing span not getting exported Sometimes header propagation is successful, but the span information isn't getting sent to New Relic. For example, if OpenTelemetry is not instrumented with a New Relic exporter, the span details never make it to New Relic. In this diagram, notice that the header propagation is successful, but no exporter is set up in Service 2 to send the span to New Relic: The following diagram also shows successful header propagation, but it includes an exporter in Service 2 that sends the span details to New Relic (see Trace API): Missing spans due to sampling process Standard distributed tracing for APM uses adaptive sampling. This means that a percentage of calls to a service will be reported as part of a distributed trace. Specific calls to your service might not have been selected to be sampled. Missing spans due to span limits maxed out There are limits on the number of spans that can be collected and displayed. If an application generates a very large number of spans for a single call, it might exceed the APM agent's span-collection limit for that harvest cycle. This could result in missing spans and significantly limit the number of traces the agent can completely sample and report. We currently only show 10,000 spans at a time. Missing spans due to spans being sent late Spans must be sent within the last twenty minutes to be captured in a trace index. If you send any spans older than twenty minutes but newer than a day, the span data will still be written. However, it won't be rolled into the trace index, which controls the trace list in the distributed tracing UI. If a span has a timestamp older than a day, it will be dropped. This often occurs when there is clock skew (timing differences) between systems or long running background jobs. Problems with trace details Middleware doesn't recognize proprietary New Relic header If your transactions are only sending the proprietary New Relic header, some middleware might not recognize the format and then drop the information as shown in this diagram: One solution is to upgrade your New Relic agent to a version that supports W3C trace context. In the diagram below, the W3C-compliant New Relic agent passes the prior header along with two standardized headers: An intermediary is missing or isn't passing trace context Some potential problems with proxies and other intermediaries: Incomplete trace. Some intermediaries won't automatically propagate the distributed tracing header. In that case, you must configure that component to allow the header to be passed from source to destination. For instructions, consult the documentation for that intermediary component. Missing intermediary in trace. If the intermediary is New Relic-monitored, ensure that it propagates the newrelic header that is generated or updated by the New Relic agent running on that intermediary. This may manifest when an intermediary was previously visible in traces, but disappeared after distributed tracing was enabled for an upstream entity (for example, a browser-monitored application). Tip If some entities report trace data to another tracing system, you can use the trace ID from the New Relic UI to search other tracing systems for missing spans. Stitching together spans from mixed sources If each agent in a chain supports W3C Trace Context, then we can stitch the spans together into a complete trace. If part of the chain is from an agent, such as Zipkin, which doesn't support W3C Trace Context, then spans coming from that agent may not be included in the trace. Trace details are obfuscated If a trace contains data from applications monitored by multiple New Relic accounts, and your user permissions don't allow you to access those accounts, some of the span and service details will be obfuscated in the UI. For example, you may see a series of asterisks ( * * * * * ) instead of the service name in your distributed tracing list if you don't have access to the account linked with the service. Trace list information and trace details don't match The trace list is generated by trace indexes, which are captured in a twenty minute window from when the first spans are received. Usually, this is due to late spans. Long traces with short backend times If you're seeing unusually short backend times for long traces, this is likely an issue with the timestamps being sent. For example, the root span might be reposting microseconds as milliseconds. This can also happen if the root span is a browser application. When using an external client like a web browser, you may experience clock skew (timing differences) more often. Problems with browser applications Missing spans and transactions after enabling for a browser application Older versions of some APM agents are incompatible with distributed tracing for browser applications. If the browser application makes an AJAX request to an APM application running an incompatible agent, then the APM agent may not record transaction and span data for that request. If distributed tracing is enabled for a browser application and you are not seeing transaction or span data for downstream APM requests, review the browser data in distributed tracing requirements, and confirm that all applications are running supported versions of the APM agent. Not seeing browser app end-user spans If traces seem to be missing end-user spans, be sure you've read and understand the browser distributed tracing requirements and enable procedures. On the AJAX UI page, there are links to the distributed tracing UI regardless of whether there are end-user spans present in that trace. For details about what data generates spans, see Requirements. Browser spans are not connected to other spans Older versions of some APM agents are incompatible with distributed tracing for browser applications. If APM spans are missing consistently from traces that include browser applications, please refer to the browser data in distributed tracing requirements and confirm that all applications are running supported versions of the APM agent. For other causes of orphaned browser spans, see Browser span reporting. Other problems Search by entity.name not finding associated app names Potential cause: For applications that have multiple app names, the entity.name attribute will be associated only with the primary app name. To search by other app names, search using the appName attribute. Supporting OpenTelemetry Questions about integrating with OpenTelemetry should be taken to the Explorers Hub.",

For our Browser & APM Pro customers, you can now enable the Browser spans for any app that uses our Browser Pro + SPA agent. This MVP includes support for same-origin AJAX requests that originate during a BrowserInteraction event. This AJAX request will be listed as the root entry span for a trace. Learn More For more details about APM & Browser agent version requirements and enablement, see our Browser Data in Distributed Tracing Page. Please note that not all APM agents are supported at this time. For more details about all supported Span attributes, visit our Event Data Dictionary Known Issues Enabling Browser in Distributed Tracing for use with current versions of these language agents, Java, PHP, and C, will result in disconnected traces (single span traces for all Browser requests) and potentially the loss of APM transaction traces and spans. Please see the APM compatibility requirements for supported versions and estimated release dates. New PageViewTiming Event to capture User Centric Perceived Performance metrics in real time With this release, we are tying together the visual and responsiveness performance for our customer's site. With every page view, the agent is now capturing the time of the first interaction along with FID (First Input Delay). The existing paint timing metrics (First Paint and First Contentful Paint) are now collected even when they occur after the load event. All of these new metrics are captured on the new PageViewTiming events, available in Insights. This new event type is available for all agents, but requires a Browser Pro subscription. Visit our New Relic Event Data Dictionary for a list of attributes and more details about the PageViewTiming event. First Interaction First Interaction timing captures the moment in time that a user first engages with a site. Within this timing, we also capture the type of interaction (click, key, mousedown, etc). This timing represents the first step in calculating the First Input Delay, which is the time from First Interaction to the moment that the site responds (is interactive). First Input Delay FID is a metric that tracks the delay between the time a user can attempt to interact with a part of the site (for example, when they click a link, tap on a button, or use a custom, JavaScript-powered control), and the time that the interface is able to respond to that interaction. We have all experienced situations where a webpage has visibly loaded, but when we try to click around on buttons or any JavaScript-powered interactive elements, nothing responds. This delay is what the FID metric tracks. The FID metric is in some ways an intersection of the First Contentful Paint and Time to Interactive metrics. It lies in the middle of those two points, measuring the time between the FCP (and therefore when a first input can be made) and when the browser’s main thread is able to respond to any interactions. One major point of FID that differentiates it from Time to Interactive is that it requires a user to interact! TTI can be calculated without user input, so it is somewhat less powerful in the sense that it isn't providing any new information about my user's active experience or frustration, we can only assume that slow = bad. Why only consider the first input Learn more For more information and query examples, see our PageViewTiming event documentation. For more information about the Paint Timing browser compatibility, see the Browser compatibility and requirements documentation. For more information about User-Centric Perceived Performance metrics, visit the Google Developers Web Fundamentals Guides on Performance. For more information about the difference between FID and TTI, see When Users Click: Tracking First Input Delay Improvements Browser interactions now wait on external scripts to finish loading: Browser interactions measure the time of all Javascript code that runs as a result of an interaction. The agent now includes the time it takes to load and execute external scripts. This is useful, for example, when the code started by an interaction must be loaded first (lazy loading).

      "body": "Application remediation involves gathering metrics and performance statistics about your application. This helps you identify bottlenecks and errors that can lead to instability in your software (and frustration for your users). New Relic provides views of your application’s performance to help you quickly identify and remediate errors. These quick wins ensure you and your colleagues can accelerate the momentum of DevOps in your organization. 1. Use semantic naming throughout New Relic Use semantic naming to give meaningful, structured names and labels to the applications you’re monitoring. Create a scalable syntax that can be understood, filtered, and sorted by any team who might use New Relic now or in the future. When you create your naming structure, be sure to consider growth and the potential for scaling/changes in your application’s architecture. Consider the following naming structure: store--us-web-prod store--us-web-stage store--us-web-dev This structure allows for additions to scale (for example, store-eu-web-prod-02), and makes the application’s environment searchable. Any convention you use should be unique to your organization’s structure, but be sure to use a convention that will allow you to optimize your environment as need. 2. Deploy the New Relic agent Review the compatibility and requirements for New Relic agents and products, and then follow the documentation to install the appropriate agent in your application. Once the agent is installed, you should see data begin to populate in New Relic within minutes. Tip If after several minutes, New Relic is not showing performance information, see No data appears. 3. Identify application performance outliers and errors The default charts in New Relic tell a story about your application’s performance. If there are performance issues, patterns in the charts highlight the causes. The following figure, from the Overview page in APM, shows a large spike occurred at noon on March 27th, and was nearly double the response time of our application’s overall trend: one.newrelic.com > APM > (select an app) > Monitoring > Overview Additionally, the response time breakdown shows a spike in Web external (which indicates downstream dependencies). Since the spike seems to correlate with periods of higher throughput, we can then use the Throughput chart to analyze the problem in more detail. 4. Drill into specific time frames Click and drag on a graph, to drill into a focused time slice of performance data to better isolate any issue you’re investigating. In this example, we’ve narrowed the view on the spike we saw in web transactions times: one.newrelic.com > APM > (select an app) > Monitoring > Overview Here, it’s obvious that some part of Web external, which is an application or service called by our Web portal app, is likely the source of the issue. 5. Drill into transaction traces to investigate outliers New Relic displays transactions ordered with the most time consuming transaction at the top. Click a transaction to navigate to the Transactions page and expand that transaction into its component parts and see any transaction traces that have been captured as a result of any performance issues. New Relic automatically captures these traces whenever a transaction violates your Apdex score by more than four times for a specific number of seconds. Tip If you’re not capturing any transaction traces, you may not be violating these thresholds. Be sure to configure transaction traces for your applications as needed. In the following example, we see that interceptor.ServletConfigInter... has significant transaction times: one.newrelic.com > APM > (select an app) > Monitoring > Overview In fact, it’s responsible for 99.9% of the app server time, which means we’re getting closer to identifying the culprit of our spike. Here, we see the same spike from before, but the performance of the transaction is broken down into its components: one.newrelic.com > APM > (select an app) > Monitoring > Overview While the share of the response times for most components of this transaction remained stable, GetPlansController (in brown) spiked massively. From the Transaction traces table, we can drill further into the transaction trace to get method-level detail of where the issue is occurring. 6. Identify performance outliers in the database We identified that GetPlansController is consuming the vast majority of our response time. Here we see it in the transaction trace summary: one.newrelic.com > APM > (select an app) > Monitoring > Overview Trace details shows an execution timeline of this transaction, and we see that Plan Service is the external transaction causing the issues—the red color-coding indicates the problem. one.newrelic.com > APM > (select an app) > Monitoring > Overview From this point, we can navigate to the Transactions summary page for Plan Service: one.newrelic.com > APM > (select an app) > Monitoring > Transactions The breakdown of the GetPlans transaction shows that database calls, particularly MySQL PlansTable select, appear to be a significant portion of the overall response time. The Breakdown table further identifies the problem: the number of database calls per transaction is very high. Note again that it’s highlighted in red. one.newrelic.com > APM > (select an app) > Monitoring > Transactions Once again, we can look at a transaction trace to find what might be causing these queries. one.newrelic.com > APM > (select an app) > Monitoring > Transactions Finally we find that an extremely large number of select methods account for the majority of transaction time. We can now take steps to address this potential N+1 query problem. After we remediate this issue, improved response times will lead to fewer frustrated requests and more satisfied customers—which will be reflected in this application's Apdex score. 7. Explore and Resolve Clusters of Errors When you need to track down what causes errors in your app, it may not be easy to identify the cause. Using applied intelligence developed by New Relic, APM Error Profiles automatically compare one set of events to another. An error profile is a collection of attributes with significantly different traits compared to non-errors. New Relic displays pie charts that sorts error attributes by the greatest deviation from the “norm.\" For backend errors, go to APM, select Error Analytics in the left nav, and then click on the Error Profile tab. In this example, the culprit is obviously a web transaction validating coupons, and now you can view the error stack trace, message, and the line of code from which the error was thrown. one.newrelic.com > APM > (select an app) > Error Analytics > Error Profile As a quality customer experience increasingly relies on complex client-side logic, it’s important to quickly analyze and understand JavaScript errors. From one.newrelic.com, click Browser in the top header, and then click JS errors in left navigation menu. Expand the details about JavaScript errors by clicking on a attribute. In this case, we've expanded the transaction names that are related to the errors: one.newrelic.com > Browser > (select an app) > JS errors Roughly half of the errors come from phone.jsp, so that is the place to start investigating. Then determine if you can safely ignore the error, or if you should resolve the error with code edits and a new deployment, or provide communication about the issue to your customers. Now that you have dealt with performance outliers and clusters of errors, you are well on your way to optimizing your application so you can baseline it for trend analysis.

      "body": "New Relic's APM Errors page helps you identify, triage, and fix errors in your services. The Errors page uses data collected by the APM agent to display stack traces, transaction attributes such as HTTP header values, and any other custom attributes, so you can understand the context of the error and fix it. Error data types: events and trace details By default, our APM agents collect two type of error data: Events Trace details Events The error event data type includes default attributes, as well as any custom attributes instrumented in your service. It doesn't include a stack trace. Find your events data in the Errors UI as follows: The Errors column in the Error traces table. The Top 5 errors chart. When you’ve drilled into a grouping of errors, those errors not displaying a stack trace are based on this type of data. You can disable Show only errors with stack trace to show errors that have this type of data collected, but no associated trace details. Events are subject to sampling (see Caps on error reporting and Charting error rates and counts). For more on error event data, see Events reported by APM. Trace details The trace details error data type includes stack traces and attributes, and supplements events with more data. It's expected that more events will be reported than trace details--see Caps on error reporting. Find your trace details data in the Errors UI as follows: The “Stack traces” column of the Error traces table. When you’ve drilled into a grouping of errors, those errors with a stack trace use this type of data: Show only errors with stack trace is enabled by default, to constrain the errors shown to just those that have this type of data collected. This data is governed by specific retention rules for Error details. Caps on error reporting New Relic caps error reporting at: 100 events per minute per agent instance 20 trace details per minute per agent instance These caps prevent error reporting from negatively impacting application performance. Examples: App running across five EC2 instances, one JVM each. New Relic caps error reporting at: 100 events per minute x 5 instances = 500 events per minute 20 trace details per minute x 5 instances = 100 trace details per minute App running on one host with ten instances. New Relic caps error reporting at: 100 events per minute x 10 instances = 1000 events per minute 20 trace details per minute x 10 instances = 200 events per minute Charting error rates and counts The Error rate chart is driven by a query on metric timeslice data, which is an unsampled aggregate data type that is accurate but has very limited dimensionality. This data can't be faceted or filtered as flexibly as error event data. You can reproduce this chart in a dashboard, or explore the metric timeslice data further by clicking the ... menu on the Error rate chart, and then using the View query or Add to dashboard options. To chart faceted error counts using event data, as in the Top 5 errors chart, use an NRQL event query. Click the ... menu on the Top 5 errors chart and choose View query for a starting point in creating your chart. Since event data can be sampled (see Caps on error reporting), you can use the EXTRAPOLATE keyword to get an accurate error count, even if sampling is occurring. Report custom errors You can report errors not collected by default with our agents using our agent APIs. For more, see the documentation on the API. Ignore errors You can prevent certain errors that would normally be reported to New Relic from being collected using our agent APIs or the server-side configuration UI. For more details, see Manage errors in APM. Reduce noise with expected errors Sometimes you want to collect error data, but not have those errors wake you up through alerts. Using the agent API, you can mark such errors as “expected”. They’ll still be visible in the Errors page, but won’t affect your service’s error rate or Apdex metrics. Disable error traces To prevent certain errors from being reported to New Relic, disable them in your agent's configuration file. For most agents, you can ignore certain error codes or disable errors completely. For more information, see your specific agent's configuration documentation: C SDK Go (not applicable; the agent only reports errors when configured to do so) Java .NET Node.js PHP Python Ruby Delete error traces Caution You cannot recover error traces after you delete them. Deleting errors is currently only available in the legacy Errors Classic UI. If you want to... Do this... Delete all error traces for your app If you have permissions to delete all error traces for an app: Go to one.newrelic.com > APM > (select an app) > More views > Errors (classic). Select Delete all errors. Delete all error traces for your account To delete all error traces for your New Relic account, get support at support.newrelic.com. Delete individual error traces To delete individual error traces, use APM's Errors (classic) page. Drill into an error from the table of errors, then click Delete this error. In addition to deleting error traces, you may also want to delete transaction traces or database/slow SQL traces. This will remove potentially sensitive data while retaining your other application data (such as Apdex, deployment information, etc.).",

      "body": "When DevOps experts need to track down what causes errors in your app, it may not be easy to identify the cause. APM's error profiles automatically compare one set of events to another. Each error profile provides visual details about significant differences in the frequency of different values for the events. For each attribute, the error profile includes: A pie chart showing how the error's attribute is distributed for values that deviate the most A table comparing the error attribute's distribution to that of non-erroring transactions This helps you take more of the guesswork out of resolving your app errors. You can more easily determine if you can safely ignore the error, or if you should attempt to resolve the error with a new deployment, code edits, customer communications, or other actions. Tip To view error profiles, you must use the classic APM view in New Relic One. To get a high-level overview of all your applications and services, use the New Relic Explorer in New Relic One. Error profile attribute examples Error profiles appear as a separate tab on your APM Errors page. Error profiles feature in APM Use error profiles to troubleshoot trends and significant differences in the frequency of error events for your app. An error profile is a collection of attributes with significantly different traits compared to non-errors. An attribute is \"unusual\" if a set of events represent what is normal (for example, errors compared to all traffic for a given time window), or differences between similar criteria (for example, two different hosts). Errors may be related to events such as: Specific web transaction names or non-web transaction names, JVM thread names, etc. Unique types of error messages, classes, etc. Random customer interactions; for example, a particular error comes from a single customer's account, while normal traffic comes from a wide variety of accounts External call counts or duration Timing differences among hosts in your ecosystem, cluster agent IDs, etc. Other anomalies Select error profile criteria Based on criteria in your app's Errors page, New Relic analyzes and lists unusual trends by their significance. Your selected criteria includes: Time window Errors page filters Search criteria on the Errors page or the Error profiles tab As you examine error profile results and want to dig deeper, add or change your app's error profile criteria. The Error profile tab refreshes to show the traits that distinguish the errors that match the updated criteria. Error profile criteria example Your app's Error profile tab currently shows several error classes or messages. To filter to a specific error class or message, use any of these options: From the Errors page's time picker, change the time range. For example, change the default (30 minutes) to Last 24 hours, ending now. From the Errors page's filter section: Select Back to groupings list, then select other Error groups, Error attributes, or Custom attributes. From the Errors page's filter section: Click a specific item on the list to narrow the filter. For example, if several error messages are listed, click only the message you are interested in. From the Error profiles tab's search box, type class, message, or other search values. Analyze error profile results To examine details for the attribute results in your app's error profile, you must use the classic APM view in New Relic One. Go to one.newrelic.com/apm > APM > (select an app) > Events > Errors, then toggle Show new view so that APM shows the classic view of the Errors page. From the Errors page, select the Error profile tab. From the Error profile tab, review the list of error attributes that match the currently selected error profile criteria. To view a specific attribute's details, click it. To highlight specific error details, mouse over any pie chart segment or table row for the attribute. To investigate a specific attribute for your app's errors, type its name in the Error profiles tab's search window, or change the currently selected error profile criteria. Compare values with large differences to identify the traits that distinguish the errors for an attribute. The comparative data in the error profile results and the error trace details can help you decide what steps to take for additional troubleshooting and resolving the error. Error and non-error distribution Depending on an error's attributes, sometimes the attribute is distributed differently for errors than for non-errors. Top deviating values New Relic analyzes each attribute for your app's errors and compares the distribution for errors that match your criteria to transactions without errors. If the proportions between these errors are roughly the same compared to transactions without any errors, the attribute does not contain much useful information for debugging. New Relic limits the error profile's pie chart and table for each attribute to show only the top deviating values. When proportions are roughly the same, New Relic does not include them in the error profile. Other category After the top deviating values, the error profile groups the rest into an Other category. This helps you focus on the values that are different for these errors. No value category If values are unusually present or are not present in the errors, you may see a No value category on the list of error profiles. Filters If you do not have any filters selected, the profile shows any distinguishing traits your errors exhibit in aggregate. Example: A certain kind of transaction makes up 20% of all of your traffic and is responsible for 80% of your errors. The error profile will show the unexpected proportions in the Transaction attribute. Adjust your error profile criteria to drill down even deeper into the profile results, so you can more effectively troubleshoot and resolve specific error events.",

Select Error instances to see event logs and stack traces, if available. Examine events leading up to error The Event log shows the browser interactions, AJAX calls, and traces that led up to an error. Decode your minified JavaScript If your JavaScript is minified, the errors on the JS errors page may not be very useful. To decode minified JavaScript and make these error stack traces more useful, you can upload JavaScript source maps to New Relic. one.newrelic.com > Browser > (select an app) > JS errors: Use this page to group and filter errors, explore stack trace details, and examine trends. (If your UI page looks different, you may be using an older, deprecated UI.) Query and visualize JS data New Relic saves JS errors as event data. This allows you to query your error data in the query builder. To run NRQL queries and create dashboards to view or share, query the JavaScriptError event type in the query builder. Use API to monitor handled errors To notice or log your app's handled errors or other miscellaneous errors, use the browser API's noticeError call. Review event logs Important SPA monitoring must be enabled. The event log shows the browser interactions, AJAX calls, and traces that led up to a JS error. This can help you troubleshoot the root cause of errors. one.newrelic.com > Browser > (select an app) > JS errors > (select an error) > Error instances: With SPA monitoring enabled, the event log shows you the activity leading up to an error. To view the Event log (if available): Go to one.newrelic.com > Browser > (select an app) > JS errors > (select an error) > Error instances. The event log will not be visible if there are no events in the event log. For example, if a JS error is occurring after an AJAX request that provides an error message, it could be that your AJAX request doesn't contain the right information. This results in a JS error due to a failed AJAX call. Troubleshoot missing event logs Some reasons for events in the event log not being present: Agent version. To capture event log data your site must have SPA monitoring enabled (browser agent version 1071 or higher). JS error not part of a browser interaction. If the JS error occurs outside of an interaction, the related browser interaction details cannot be captured (for example: if an async JS file experiences an error). A click triggered the JS error. In some cases if the error is a direct result of a click, no associated interactions are captured. Without event logs or stack traces, you can use the error detail charts to analyze the impact the error has by browser type, device type, and URI. View stack traces Stack traces can show you if an error is breaking important functionality, or if it's a less important error. To view an error's stack trace (if available): go to one.newrelic.com > Browser > (select an app) > JS errors > (select an error) > Error instances. Troubleshoot missing stack traces Some reasons why you may not see a stack trace for an error: If errors are not thrown, they will not produce a stack trace. The JS script is hosted on a CDN or another external location, and New Relic can't see the errors originating from those scripts. This can be solved in some cases by using cross-origin resource sharing (CORS). It is an AngularJS error. For more on this, see Missing Angular errors. The error is a SyntaxError or Script error: These occur while the script is loading, so they do not produce a stack trace. Some older browsers may generate errors without a stack trace, or may provide a stack trace that is not usable. You've captured the error before the New Relic agent sees it. If the error occurs during multiple harvest cycles in the same user visit, only error events reported during the first harvest cycle will have a stack trace recorded. Some solutions for reporting stack traces: Use the noticeError API call. Enable development mode. Use the JS errors UI page to get more information, including the event log. The JS errors page is designed to give you actionable information even without a stack trace. Global and generic errors New Relic wraps JavaScript functions to get information about thrown errors via the stack trace. If errors aren't thrown, they won't be available. For example, if you have an AngularJS application, follow the troubleshooting procedures when AngularJS errors do not appear in the UI. For some older browsers, the following errors may be unavailable: SyntaxError or Script error: These occur while the script is loading, so they do not produce a stack trace. In-line JavaScript or event handler errors: These are unwrapped. Errors thrown from third-party scripts that reside on another domain are not available. Errors occurring on older browsers: These may not be able to provide a usable stack trace. In some cases, they may not provide a stack trace at all. Error collection is done by wrapping JavaScript functions, so errors thrown by the browser at a lower level (such as cross-origin resource sharing errors) also are not available.",

      "body": "Caution Developer mode is deprecated and no longer supported as of Ruby agent version 4.1.0. The New Relic Ruby agent includes Developer mode, a built-in UI for examining details about web transactions in your application. With Developer mode, you can examine the library and database calls made by the controller actions as they are invoked on the Rails instance. The free Developer mode gives you some of the same in-depth transaction visibility you get with New Relic's transaction traces feature. However, it works only in a single Rails instance, and it has much higher overhead than the production version. It is not recommended for use beyond a developer's desktop sandbox. Security considerations The Ruby agent's Developer mode, which is on by default when the RAILS_ENV == \"development\", does not communicate with the New Relic collector in any way. Pie charts are rendered using Google Charts, which involves an HTTP post of aggregate data. Tip The Ruby agent's Production mode, which is on by default when the RAILS_ENV == \"production\" and RAILS_ENV == \"staging\", does communicate with the New Relic site. For more information, see Security. Installation To install Developer mode, install Ruby agent as a plugin or gem. You may also need to set developer_mode to true in your newrelic.yml for the RAILS_ENV in which you are working. Developer mode is on by default only when RAILS_ENV = development. While a newrelic.yml file will be created as part of the installation, it is not necessary to have a valid license key. Known issues Known issues with Developer mode include: Requires Rails 2.3 or higher Developer mode in recent agents only works on Rails 2.3 or higher. It is rack based, and earlier versions of the framework did not incorporate rack. The developer edition installs a middleware in your app that responds to any URL prepended with /newrelic; for example, /newrelic, /newrelic/files/images/foo.png, etc. In some cases the /newrelic URL gets captured by an earlier middleware. In this situation, disable the Developer mode route and include the middleware yourself: At the beginning of the file, in config.ru: require 'newrelic_rpm' require 'new_relic/rack/developer_mode' use NewRelic::Rack::DeveloperMode Copy Incompatible with Pow Developer mode is not supported from Pow, a zero-config Rack server for Mac OS X. Using Developer mode If you run your application on your desktop using thin, WEBrick, or something similar, open the URL /newrelic on your server to see the Developer mode user interface. Caution If you are using Passenger, Unicorn, or other forking application servers on your desktop, you may notice some odd behavior with disappearing data if your application server launches multiple instances. Refer to the Troubleshooting tips, which follow. Developer Mode Breakdown Chart Troubleshooting Troubleshooting tips for Developer mode: Disappearing requests If you have this problem with Unicorn or other multi-worker dispatchers, try limiting the number of workers to 1. Undefined method path for Rack::Request Some users may see an undefined method path for #<Rack::Request>. If you are using Rails version 2.3.2, then you are mostly likely running into a problem with the way the Rack dependency was defined in the Rails package. Either upgrade to 2.3.3 (or higher), or define Rack version 1.0.1 as a dependency in your Gemfile. ActiveRecord reloads Developer mode reloads ActiveRecord method definitions for every reload and reports the time spent defining the methods (such as define_attribute_method). This does not happen in production. To get real results to compare, add the following to the development environment: config.cache_classes = true Copy",

      "body": "Your New Relic users can be on one of two user models: this doc explains the New Relic One user model. Important If your New Relic organization was created before July 30 2020 and you haven't gone through a user migration process, your users are likely on our original user model. For more on this, see User model changes. Overview This doc will explain the structure of the New Relic One user model, including: User type (basic user versus full user) Default user groups, including Admin and User Roles and capabilities For how to add and manage users in the UI, see User management. User type: basic and full Important This section is for users on our New Relic One user model. If you're on our original user model, see Original users. The user type (basic user or full user) determines whether a user has access to our Full Stack Observability features. A user's type is something you set long-term based on that user's expected New Relic responsibilities. Below are details on the two user types. Note that billing-related aspects only apply if you're on New Relic One pricing. Basic user. Details: These users are free and have access to a wide range of features, including setting up and configuring any New Relic data-reporting tool, running queries of your data, using our logs UI, making custom charts and dashboards, and setting up alerts. Unlike full users, they do not have access to our Full-Stack Observability features and some Applied Intelligence features (for a detailed comparison, see Capabilities). Basic users will see prompts to become a full user when they attempt to access unavailable features. For details, see Upgrade. Full user. Details: Full users have access to our Full-Stack Observability features, which include curated UI experiences like APM, infrastructure monitoring, browser monitoring, mobile monitoring, synthetic monitors, access to New Relic One apps, and more. For details, see Capabilities. Standard edition includes one free full user and up to five total full users. A full user can downgrade to a basic user twice in a 12-month period. To see and edit a user's user type, use the User management UI. Learn more about basic user versus full user differences: Compare full vs basic capabilities Below is a table comparing what basic users and full users can do. In short: basic users have access to our Telemetry Data Platform and some Applied Intelligence features, while full users have theoretical access to everything (dependent on any group-related restrictions). Another way to think about this is that full users are users with access to Full Stack Observability, which gates our more curated UI features. Features Full user Basic user Full-Stack Observability (Curated UI experiences) Application performance monitoring (APM) UI Infrastructure monitoring UI Digital Experience Monitoring UI, which includes: Browser monitoring UI Mobile monitoring UI Synthetic monitoring UI Synthetics checks Serverless monitoring UI Logs in context Distributed tracing Infinite Tracing (Pro and Enterprise edition) Assorted UI experiences, including: Kubernetes cluster explorer UI Key transaction UI Workloads UI Manage other users Access to New Relic One apps Can build apps but can't access other apps Applied Intelligence Automatic anomaly detection Correlated alerts and events Anomaly/alert analysis Root cause details in issues Telemetry Data Platform Data ingest from any source (agents, integrations, APIs) Query your data Create custom charts and dashboards Alerts and notifications Our APIs, including NerdGraph (GraphQL) (with some restrictions) Query and chart log data Build New Relic One apps (but cannot access other apps) Encryption at rest Standard data retention Security and compliance Data management Note that the pricing edition (Standard, Pro, or Enterprise) will also affect what features you have access to. For organizations with New Relic One pricing, learn more about how full users impact billing. Tips on choosing user type A user's type (basic user vs full user) is meant to be a long-term assignment, based on the New Relic responsibilities that user is expected to perform. A full user can be downgraded to a basic user only twice in one year. Below are tips for why you'd choose full user versus basic user. Reasons to make someone a full user: They play a key role in the development, testing, deployment, and maintenance phases of the application development lifecycle. They break/fix code regularly; they are responsible for triaging workflows, troubleshooting, or managing users and roles for their team. They have DevOps practices (i.e. version control systems and implement CI/CD). They need to use New Relic's curated dashboards and experiences (not just the ability to create their own custom queries and charts); in other words, they need full access to our platform. They need to be able to manage users and/or billing. Reasons to make someone a basic user: They play a key role in the planning phase of the application development lifecycle. They use and configure New Relic agents, APIs, and integrations to send us data, and access, configure, and use alerts on such data (not necessarily responsible for triaging workflows, troubleshooting, or managing users and roles for their team). They want to see high-level analytics and business metrics for future planning (such as C-Suite executives). They do not need to use our curated experiences and dashboards, but would benefit from the ability to create their own custom queries and charts of data; in other words, they don't need full access to the platform. They don't manage users. For accounts on New Relic One pricing, learn more about user-related billing calculations. Understand user-related billing If you're on the New Relic One pricing plan, full users are billable, and there are restrictions around how often a full user can downgrade to a basic user. For details, see User count billing details. For how to query and alert on usage data, see Query usage data. Have questions about why you can't access something? See Factors affecting access. Default groups: Admin and User For users on our New Relic One user model, a \"group\" is what allows the grouping together and managing of multiple users at the same time. Your New Relic users are assigned to a group, and that group is granted access to specific roles on specific accounts. We have two default groups: User: This group allows a user to use and configure monitoring/analysis features but not perform account-related tasks like managing billing or users. It has access to the All product admin role, which gives access to our observability platform tools but not to the organization and user management capabilities governed by the Organization manager and Authentication manager roles. Admin: has full access and capabilities, including the organization-level admin abilities. This is the equivalent of having the All product admin, the Billing user, the Organization manager and the Authentication domain manager roles. These groups are added inside your default authentication domain, which includes the default settings of users a) being managed via New Relic and b) logging in via standard email and password. If you add other authentication domains (for SAML SSO and/or SCIM provisioning of users), you'd have new custom groups in those new domains to govern those users. Note that groups, whether default or custom, are not what limit a user's capabilities: it is the role that is assigned to that group (with any basic user restrictions on top of that). If your organization is Pro or Enterprise edition and you want to understand how users are granted access to specific roles and accounts, see Access grants. To change the group a user is in, use the User management UI. How do user type, roles, and groups relate to each other? For users on the New Relic One user model, here's a table explaining how user type (basic vs full user), roles, and groups relate to each other: Full user Basic user Group Full users can be assigned to default groups (User and Admin) or custom groups. When basic users are added to a group, that group's role-related restrictions apply. A basic user's capabilities can be restricted in that way, but a basic user can never be granted more capabilities than they start with. For Standard edition, basic users can't be assigned to groups. For Pro and Enterprise edition, they can. Role For an explanation of the roles our default groups have, see Default groups. Custom groups can have either our default standard roles, or custom roles. A basic user's abilities aren't directly defined by a specific role. A basic user can best be described as having the All product admin role but without access to Full Stack Observability features (learn more about user type). When basic users are added to a group, that group's role-related restrictions apply, but a basic user can never be granted more capabilities than they start with. Roles and capabilities For users on the New Relic One user model, a \"role\" can be defined as \"a set of capabilities.\" A capability is defined as the ability to do a specific New Relic task, like 'Delete alert conditions' (learn more about capabilities). Roles are assigned to user groups. Our default groups Admin and User already have our standard roles (defined below) assigned. Organizations on Pro or Enterprise edition can also create custom roles. Standard (default) roles Roles are sets of capabilities. We have several \"standard roles,\" which are roles that satisfy some commonly needed use cases. To view roles and their associated capabilities, use the Organization and access UI. Important Note that some of our standard roles have hidden, non-exposed capabilities that are not available for selection when creating a custom role. The only standard roles that can be replicated with a custom role are Standard user and Read only; all others have some hidden capabilities. Our standard roles include: Standard roles Scope Description All product admin Account Provides admin-level access to observability platform features but not organization-level and user management features. In other words, this role includes all New Relic capabilities with the exception of managing users (Authentication domain manager role), managing organization/account-structure settings (Organization manager role), and managing billing (Billing user role). Note: the Standard user role is essentially the All product admin role minus observability feature configuration capabilities. Standard user Account Provides access to observability platform features, but lacks permissions for configuring those features (for example, ability to configure synthetic monitor secure credentials) and lacks organization-level and user management permissions. Note: the Standard user role is essentially the All product admin role without that role's ability to configure platform features. Billing user Account Provides ability to manage subscriptions and billing setup, and read-only access to the rest of the platform. For organizations with multiple accounts, billing is aggregated in the primary (first-created) account, which is why assigning this role to that primary account grants billing permissions for the entire organization. Organization manager Organization Provides the ability to manage organization settings, including organization structure, name, and preferences. Due to our recent switch to the New Relic One user model, this role currently has few abilities but more will be added over time. For how to grant this role, see Add user management capability. Organization read only Organization Provides the ability to view organization-level settings. For how to grant this role, see Add user management capability. Authentication domain manager Organization Provides ability to add and manage users, and configure authentication domains for users on the New Relic One user model. For how to grant this role, see Add user management capability. Authentication domain read only Organization Provides the ability to view users in your organization and view the configuration of authentication domains. For how to grant this role, see Add user management capability. Read only Account Provides read-only access to the New Relic platform (except for synthetic monitor secure credentials). Manage v1 users Account For New Relic organizations that existed before July 30 2020 and have users on our original user model, this role lets you manage those \"v1\" users. For more about how you'd assign roles to groups and create custom roles, see the user management tutorial. Capabilities A role, whether one of our standard roles or a custom role, is defined as a set of capabilities. To view roles and their associated capabilities, use the Organization and access UI. Important Some of our standard roles have hidden capabilities that aren't available for selection when creating a custom role. For details, see Standard roles. A view of the capabilities associated with the All product admin role. When creating a custom role, you select a custom set of capabilities. Note that the capabilities we expose may change over time: this screenshot was taken in April of 2021. For how to set up roles with custom capabilities, see the user management tutorial. Manage users To learn how to add users, assign them to groups, and create custom groups and roles, see Manage users. 2020 user model changes If you'd like to understand how our user model changed in 2020 and what the impacts of that change were, see User model changes.",

      "body": "Browser uses a JavaScript snippet, also referred to as an \"agent,\" to instrument your app's webpages. The JavaScript collects data for browser monitoring. To install the browser agent, you can choose from a number of deployment options. If you don't have one already, create a New Relic account. It's free, forever. Enable browser monitoring Browser Pro+SPA is the default agent when you enable browser monitoring. This automatically gives you access to all of our browser monitoring features. For more information about the browser monitoring options, see Browser agent types in this document. To enable browser monitoring: Go to one.newrelic.com, select Browser, and then select Add more data. Follow the instructions in the UI to add browser monitoring to your app. Generate some traffic for your app, then wait a few minutes for data to appear in New Relic. Optional: After installation is complete and you are seeing data, go to the App settings page for additional agent configuration, or to change the browser agent type. It may take several minutes after enabling the browser monitoring agent before your webpage data appear in New Relic. If have problems, follow our troubleshooting tips. Deployment options No matter which option you use to deploy browser monitoring, the end result is the same: the browser monitoring JavaScript snippet (also referred to as the \"agent\") is inserted into your app pages. The method you select depends on your preferences and business needs. Enable an APM-monitored app When enabling browser monitoring, you can use an APM agent to automatically inject the browser monitoring JavaScript snippet for you. This is the easiest way to install the agent for an app that's already being monitored by APM. APM-monitored apps are listed on your APM Applications index. Enable with copy/paste When enabling browser monitoring, you can manually insert the JavaScript snippet into your app's webpages. The copy/paste option gives you control over the exact placement of our JavaScript snippet, which is required to monitor the webpage's performance. This is useful for: Standalone apps, static sites, and cached pages delivered by CDN APM apps that are not as closely coupled to the browser app as with a standard server-side app (for example, when your client-side app talks to a REST API back end) Some tips for using the JavaScript snippet: Placement in your webpage: Copy the code snippet, then paste it inline into your pages as close to the top of the <head> element as possible, but after any position-sensitive <meta> tags (for example, X-UA-Compatible or charset information). For more information on the inline head placement, see JavaScript placement requirements. License key and app ID: Near the bottom of the generated JavaScript is your browser license key and application ID. This is useful with the REST API and API Explorer. Instrument webpages using the APM agent This information applies to apps that are also monitored by APM. Our APM agents can instrument webpages with the required JavaScript for page load timing. If you are using an APM agent's API to manually add the JavaScript snippet to your webpages, insert the instrumentation snippet as close to the top as possible. This allows you to take advantage of detailed information about browser's AJAX calls and JavaScript errors. For more information, see the instructions for your APM agent: C SDK Go Java .NET Node.js PHP Python Ruby Use REST API This information applies to apps that are also monitored by APM. The REST API lets you manage deployment outside the browser monitoring UI. This is useful for large organizations deploying multiple apps. Browser agent types: Lite, Pro, Pro+SPA We have three types of browser agents: Lite, Pro, and Pro+SPA. The agent type has no impact on your billing. Browser agent type Comparison Pro+SPA This is the default installed agent when you enable browser monitoring. What it includes: Gives you access to all of the Browser Pro features and to Single Page App (SPA) monitoring. Provides detailed page timing data and the most up-to-date New Relic features, including distributed tracing, for all types of applications. Pro+SPA is not limited only to single page applications. After install, you can downgrade anytime to the less advanced agents if you don't want or need SPA monitoring. Pro What it includes: Gives you access to the Browser Pro features. What it doesn't include: Lacks the functionality designed for single page app monitoring. Lite What it includes: Gives you information about some basic page load timing and browser user information. What it doesn't include: Lacks the Browser Pro features and SPA features. Details about how agent types relate to pricing: New Relic One pricing: This pricing plan has data ingest as a billing factor. If you want to reduce data ingest, you may want to consider downgrading to lesser agent types after install. Original pricing: Your access to browser monitoring features is gated by your subscription plan, not by the agent type. This means there is no reason not to use the default Pro+SPA agent. After initial agent installation is finished, you can go to the App settings page to edit your configuration or to change your subscription.",

Before you install the browser agent, make sure your system meets these requirements. Want to try out our browser monitoring? Create a New Relic account for free! No credit card required. Basic requirements To report data to browser, your application must at a minimum meet two basic requirements: The traffic to the application must be from clients able to load and execute browser JavaScript code and set cookies. Clients accessing the application must be able to send data to New Relic through HTTP requests. HTTPS is required for browser Pro features. Important Browsers that subscribe to a disconnect list or that use content filtering extensions such as AdBlock may not be able to send data to New Relic. For example, if you are using the Enhanced Tracking Prevention disconnect list for Mozilla Firefox 69.0 or higher, you will need to change the default configuration. Most typical browser applications meet these requirements. However, browser applications in restricted environments may have difficulty reporting data to New Relic; for example: Hybrid mobile applications Applications installed on unusual hardware, such as point-of-sale terminals or consumer appliances For more information, review the instrumentation for browser monitoring documentation, and verify end-user network access. Browser types Instrumentation is compatible with every browser type, including Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox, Microsoft Internet Explorer and Edge, and Apple Safari. The user interface is compatible with New Relic's supported browser versions. Exceptions Comments Paint timings The firstPaint and firstContentfulPaint attributes in BrowserInteraction, PageView, and PageViewTiming events are only compatible with: Chrome 60 or higher for desktop and mobile (Android webview and Chrome for Android) Opera 47 or higher for desktop Opera 44 or higher for Android mobile Samsung Internet for mobile AJAX AJAX timing features are not available with: Chrome for iPhone and iPad IE 7 and 8 PageAction events PageAction events require a browser that fully supports cross-domain XMLHttpRequests. Internet Explorer versions 9 and lower cannot record PageAction events. Learn more on querying your data. Session traces Session traces are reported only from browsers that support the Resource Timing Specification. SHA-256 New Relic can only monitor browsers that are compatible with SHA-256. APM agents You can deploy the browser agent for apps monitored by APM, or you can deploy the browser agent for your standalone apps. For more information, see the installation procedures. If you are deploying browser for an app using APM, make sure your agent supports browser monitoring: C SDK: Version 1.0.0 or higher Go: Version 2.5.0 or higher Java: Version 3.4.0 or higher .NET: Version 2.20.25.0 or higher Node.js: Version 1.4.0 or higher PHP: Version 4.4.5.35 or higher Python: Version 2.10.1.9 or higher Ruby: Version 3.7.0.177 or higher Supported frameworks The browser agent collects data on all front-end frameworks. However, the monitoring occurs on lower-level \"primitives\" that JavaScript frameworks use, so the level of detail collected by the instrumentation may vary depending on your specific framework. Exceptions Comments Zone.js If you're using AngularJS and you want to use our SPA monitoring features, note that Zone.js versions 0.6.18 to 0.6.24 are not compatible with browser. In all cases, the browser agent must be loaded before Zone.js to avoid errors. Cypress.io Browser is unable to properly instrument the open and send methods of requests when tests are run in Cypress. This will cause the following error to be thrown: Cannot set property 'status' of undefined Copy This will only affect customers running tests with the Browser agent present in their code. Production applications should not be affected. html2pdf.js This library is not compatible with our Pro+SPA agent due to the way this library wraps promises. If you're using this library, we recommend selecting the Pro agent type. Content Security Policy (CSP) considerations In order to obtain accurate browser performance metrics, browser requires the use of a small, inline JavaScript snippet. New Relic carefully reviews the inline JavaScript to prevent Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) and other potential vulnerabilities. Content Security Policy Level 2 adds restrictions to the types of JavaScript allowed, such as inline scripts. It also limits which domains can load scripts during page load. Important If your website does not allow any third-party hosted JavaScript to run, you must request a CSP exception via your organization’s standard procedures in order to install the browser monitoring agent. When requesting a CSP exception, follow your organization's standard procedures to contact your web or security team. The browser JavaScript agent requires the following CSP exceptions in order to run properly. Alternatively, you can add all of these exceptions to the fallback default-src directive (instead of script-src and connect-src). CSP exception Comments unsafe-inline Add to the script-src directive or to the fallback default-src directive. This is required because the agent is installed by including an inline script. https://js-agent.newrelic.com Add to the script-src directive or to the fallback default-src directive. This is where additional script files that the agent requires are hosted. https://bam.nr-data.net https://bam-cell.nr-data.net Important Add https://gov-bam.nr-data.net if you're using FedRAMP-compliant endpoints. Add to the script-src directive or to the fallback default-src directive. This is where the agent sends its collected data. One of the calls to this URL is a JSONP call, which means that the URL must be allowed as a script source. Add to the connect-src directive or to the fallback default-src directive. The connect-src directive affects the URLs that scripts can call (for example, using the XMLHttpRequest interface). If you have CSP restrictions specifically around this directive, then add this URL as an exception.",

Requirements Agent version nr-593 or higher. Description Adds a user-defined attribute name and value to subsequent events on the page. Make this call before the window load event fires (when that data is transmitted) in order for the attributes to be included in the PageView event. Once an attribute is set, New Relic One records it with all PageAction events until the page is reloaded or the attribute is manually unset. If you are using SPA monitoring with a compatible agent version, attributes set with this call will also be included in newrelic.interaction events. However, attributes set using the SPA API will take precedence over these attributes. Errors for custom attributes will be included in events on the JS Errors page. To view or log errors for a custom attribute via API, use the browser API's noticeError call. Parameters Parameter Description $name string Required. Name of the attribute. Appears as column in the PageView event. It will also appear as a column in the PageAction event if you are using it. Avoid using reserved NRQL words when you name the attribute/value. $value string OR integer Required. Value of the attribute. Appears as the value in the named attribute column in the PageView event. It will appear as a column in the PageAction event if you are using it. Custom attribute values cannot be complex objects, only simple types such as Strings and Integers. Avoid using reserved NRQL words when you name the attribute/value. Examples Get JavaScript/jQuery for HTML elements This example uses JavaScript/jQuery to get the values of the following HTML elements on a Drupal-generated page: <link rel=\"shortlink\" href=\"/node/1111\" /> <h1>Using NRQL</h1> New Relic reports them as custom attributes.

      "body": "Browser monitoring supports the uploading of source maps. Source maps support is primarily useful for \"decoding\" minified JavaScript. Minified JavaScript results in mostly useless error stack traces on browser's JS errors page. Uploading source maps converts these errors to understandable stack traces, with useful references to code lines. This feature might also be useful for bundled or transpiled JavaScript code. Browser gives you two options for using source maps: Upload source maps via the browser UI Publish source maps to browser via the API This document will explain the first method: how to upload source maps via the UI, along with general troubleshooting help. For instructions on using the API method, see Push source maps via the API. Import source maps via the New Relic UI You can drag and drop, or upload, a source map file into the browser UI to associate it with a specific JavaScript file. New Relic will then convert minified stack traces into un-minified traces and source code visible on the JS errors page. To drag in or upload a source map to browser, the source map must be on your local machine. To associate a source map with an error stack trace on the JS errors page: Go to one.newrelic.com > Browser > (select an app) > JS Errors, then select a JS error group. (Don't select an Errors without a stack trace group.) From the selected JS error group, select the error instance details tab (next to the Summary tab). Error groupings will have one or more frames listed that reference JavaScript files. Select the + icon on the right side of a frame to expand it. Then drag the matching source map file into the frame. Alternative option: when the frame is expanded, select find file to upload the file manually. Tip An error frame with a gray strip on the left side indicate minified JS; a blue strip indicates it has had a source map applied. Other JS error frame features include: If you want to... Do this... See more of the surrounding code Select Show 10 more lines above/below to view the code before or after the code in the stack trace. See original, minified file information For individual frame info: Next to the frame's source line and column, mouse over the ellipsis. For raw data of the entire stack trace: At the top of the error tab, select < /> Raw. Remove a source map From an expanded stack trace frame, select Remove file. Troubleshooting Stack traces are still minified If you have uploaded source maps to New Relic and still see minified stack traces, there are a few things to check. Using the API is the best way to investigate potential issues, by listing or deleting published source maps. Typical problems Troubleshooting tips URL mismatch Each frame in the stack trace is associated with a specific JavaScript URL. That URL must match the JavaScript URL that was used when publishing the source map. Ensure that these URLs match exactly. Release name/ID mismatch If the JavaScript URL is not versioned when you deploy your front end assets, a release name and release ID must be specified using the newrelic.addRelease API method, and also when publishing your source maps. Ensure that these strings match exactly. 409 error: Combination of javascriptUrl, releaseName, and releaseId must be unique If a source map file for a particular JavaScript URL is uploaded without a release name or ID specified, New Relic treats the URL as a unique identifier. To resolve this, delete the source map that has NULL release name and ID values and re-upload all versions for that URL including those parameters. This will allow multiple versions of source maps for a particular JS URL. Missing SourcesContent component Your mapping file must contain the SourcesContent component for New Relic to un-minify your stack traces. If you have uploaded your map successfully and are still not seeing un-minified code, check the original source map for this component. If you can't find it, regenerate the source map so the component is included, and upload your map to New Relic. If the SourcesContent component is not added, an error similar to Whoops, that was the wrong file. Please try again. will appear. Can't generate source maps Having trouble even generating source maps? Every build system has its own instructions for generating source maps. For more specific details, please see the documentation for your particular tool. Below are source map generation instructions for two popular build systems: Generate source maps with UglifyJS Generate source maps using UglifyJS: When \"uglifying\" source files, specify a source map file name and include the original source content: Starting on version v3.12.5: uglifyjs [source files] \\ -o bundle.min.js \\ -c -m --source-map \"includeSources=true\" Copy For older versions: uglifyjs [source files] \\ -o bundle.min.js \\ --source-map bundle.min.js.map \\ --source-map-include-sources \\ -c -m Copy Generate source maps with webpack Generate source maps using Webpack: In your production webpack config, simply specify source-map for the config.devtool property. The sourceMapFilename property of config.output is optional and defaults to [name].js.map. devtool: 'source-map', output: { path: path.join(__dirname, 'dist'), filename: '[name].js', sourceMapFilename: '[name].js.map', }, Copy",

      "body": "Successfully scaling DevOps requires a robust understanding of dependencies across application teams and related services. Use New Relics service maps to discover and mitigate risky dependencies from upstream and downstream services. Prerequisites This tutorial assumes you’ve completed the previous DevOps procedures. 1. Analyze dependencies with service maps Use service maps for each application and note any dependent systems and transactions. New Relic recommends that you start by viewing the entire architecture using the Discover your environment option. one.newrelic.com > Service Maps > App/Service list This initial view shows all applications that are configured in your account. Applications that have violated a warning threshold are shown in yellow, and those with an active alert are shown in red. Healthy applications appear in green. New Relic uses a bold line to map applications to the services (such as databases) they connect to. Familiarize yourself with these maps to see how applications and their services fit together. Take note of which applications have the most dependencies and which rely on the same dependency, such as an API. Click an application to see high level metrics about that app, including throughput, response time, Apdex score, and error rate for the last 30 minutes. Tracking throughput is a good way to determine which of your applications are serving the most traffic. After looking at the architecture as a whole, review the applications that have the most dependencies. Select the App/Services list to see a full list of your applications. one.newrelic.com > Service Maps > App/Service list In this example, we’ve chosen Tower-Chicago from the App/Services list. All of the traffic being sent to Tower-Chicago is coming from Proxy-East. In this case, Tower-Chicago is showing 48.3 requests per minute, or 11.3% of the 426 requests per minute flowing through Proxy-East. one.newrelic.com > Service Maps > App/Service list In most cases, the separate applications and services represented in service maps are created and maintained by separate teams. This exercise of walking through the dependencies of your architecture should involve representatives from each of those teams. Teams should work together to ask questions such as: How critical is this particular dependency? What would happen if it were to go down? What happened last time it went down? Was there a revenue loss? 2. Identify back-end application dependency risks Once you’ve analyzed your applications’ dependencies, you’ll want to examine the quality of dependency execution. For example, is the dependency stable and predictable for each application or transaction you’ve identified? To do this, you’ll first need to gather as much information as you can about the applications from New Relic Insights, which helps you analyze data that is collected about the applications in more detail. Here is an example NRQL query to further analyze back-end service performance: SELECT count(appName)/30 as 'Throughput', apdex(duration), average(duration), stddev(duration), max(duration), count(error_type), uniquecount(host) FROM Transaction FACET appName SINCE 30 MINUTES AGO Copy This query shows you each application’s request per minute (throughput), Apdex score, and an overview of how the application is performing overall (through the standard deviation calculation, in which lower numbers are generally better). It also shows errors for the time period and the number of hosts on which the application is running. insights.newrelic.com > query results Next, gather information on incidents and events related to the services from New Relic Alerts: Click Alerts > Incidents > All Incidents. alerts.newrelic.com > Incidents > All Incidents Click Alerts > Events > All Events. alerts.newrelic.com > Incidents > All Events Tip Using webhooks to send alert events to New Relic Insights, allows you to supplement your dashboards with Alerts data. The process is outlined in this community discussion post. Here is a simplified example of the results of this exercise: Application Number of dependencies RPM Hosts APDEX (avg) Last outage TTR (hrs) Routing Service 10 983 4 .93 2/19/18 .75 Tower Austin 1 58 1 .95 10/11/17 1.5 Proxy-East 11 498 4 .92 1/4/18 .25 Proxy-West 11 495 4 .97 12/3/17 .25 WebPortal 7 396 8 .98 4/1/18 2.5 Supplement this data with the data that your teams know about your service and that you gathered from the dependency exercise in step 1, and use that data to develop hypotheses about the highest risk areas in your services that should be mitigated. 3. Identify front-end dependency risk Once you’ve analyzed back-end dependencies, explore front-end dependencies. This is a critical step because as you walk higher up the stack and closer to the user, you will likely have more dependencies and abstractions. Service maps seamlessly integrate data from browser monitoring and mobile monitoring to help you understand the dependencies from front-end user interfaces to back-end services. one.newrelic.com > Service Maps Use the service map view to drill into front-end dependencies, and execute a similar exercise to the one you executed for back-end dependencies. This exercise will again expose data to help you identify risk areas you should address and optimize. We recommend that you conduct the analysis with user interface (UI) teams so that you can also gather a complementary qualitative understanding of what the UI teams consider critical based on their experience. A ranking from the UI teams of the most critical dependency is a useful output of this work. 4. Identify Microservice Dependencies If you are using microservices, you can have dozens, if not hundreds, of services that are calling each other. Use Distributed Tracing to see how all those services connect together and how your requests flow through those different services. Distributed tracing lets you see the path that a request takes as it travels through a distributed system. A distributed trace is composed of multiple \"spans,\" which represent time spent in services or resources of those services. Click on the Distributed tracing menu in APM left nav. You can see “trace listing” view where you’ll be able to quickly identify slow traces and traces with errors. The scatter plot lets you easily see outliers. Below that are the trace summaries, click on a trace to see details. Dive into distributed traces to see how long each span takes. Click into each span to see historical performance charts and associated attributes that layer in the context you need to understand and troubleshoot issues. one.newrelic.com > APM > (select an app) > Distributed tracing This rounds out your list of dependencies. 5. Create an action plan for risk mitigation Once you’ve analyzed the dependencies across your application from both front-end and back-end services, create an action plan to reduce dependency risks and achieve your service level objectives (SLO). As you prioritize these next steps, we recommend you keep these four principles in mind: Understand your risk tolerance. It’s helpful to have a clear picture of your tolerance for risk, which ideally should be informed by your service level objectives (refer to the Establish Objectives and Baselines tutorial for more information). Set an alert policy to monitor dependencies that you’ve determined have a high relationship to SLO achievement. Minimize dependencies. The simpler you keep your code, the less functions you'll have referring to other modules. Removing unnecessary complexity is an important way to ensure you have a maintainable system that meets your customers’ expectations. Localize dependencies. For the code you write, package together functions that depend on each other whenever possible. Stabilize dependencies. When dependencies are unavoidable, mitigate risks by ensuring these dependencies point to modules that are the least likely to change or are easier to substitute. When your action plan is complete, monitor the results of the efforts. The efficacy of your actions to resolve dependency risks should ultimately be measured by your SLOs",

      "body": "By default, mobile monitoring enables crash reporting for your mobile applications to help track and diagnose crashes. When an Android application crashes, the agent uploads a crash report to the New Relic collector. The crash details will then be processed and de-obfuscated automatically if you are using ProGuard or DexGuard. You can view detailed information about crashes in the Crash analysis UI, or receive crash notifications by email. You can also explore the crash data deeper with New Relic Insights, or integrate with ticketing systems for further investigation. Upload the ProGuard or DexGuard file The Android agent supports ProGuard and DexGuard. DexGuard is an extension to ProGuard, and it behaves the same as ProGuard when dealing with crash symbolication and obfuscated code maps. ProGuard obfuscates your code by renaming classes, fields, and methods with semantically obscure labels. DexGuard adds another additional layer of obfuscation and security, but otherwise behaves identically to ProGuard. If ProGuard or DexGuard is enabled, the stack trace produced by a crash consists only of these obfuscated labels, which are not human-readable. Follow the SDK installation or upgrade instructions to configure ProGuard or DexGuard and enable crash reporting. Be sure to create the newrelic.properties file containing your application token. Use mapping.txt file The agent uses the mapping.txt file produced during a ProGuard/DexGuard-enabled build. This file consists of the obfuscated label names, and provides reverse mapping between obfuscated and plain text labels. You must use the copy of mapping.txt generated during the build that produced your final application. The application's build ID changes each time an APK is generated, and the build ID in the mapping file must match the ID contained in each uploaded crash report. After you create a newrelic.properties file containing your New Relic app token in your project, the ProGuard or DexGuard mapping.txt file will be uploaded automatically after each build. Exception If either of the following situations occur, you must manually upload the mapping.txt replacement file: If the mapping.txt file is renamed using the DexGuard -printmapping option, the Android agent will be unable to locate or upload the stripped names. If you see obfuscated crash reports in the Crashes page, you may not have a mapping.txt file uploaded. Map Processing Important Agent version 5.27.0 introduces changes to the way the agent plugin process maps during builds. Maps are reported for select variant builds The agent will tag and report only those mapping.txt files generated by Release build-type variants. This behavior can be configured or disabled through the New Relic Gradle Plugin extension. Variants are assigned unique build IDs During an execution of a Gradle build, a single unique ID (build ID) was generated to represent all variants of the app built during that invocation. This often led to mismatched crash reports for customers using variants to customize a common app code base. Each variant is now identified by its own unique ID, which is used when reporting the variant's ProGuard map to New Relic. You can disable this behavior through the New Relic Gradle Plugin extension. Compress maps prior to upload As apps get larger, so do their associated maps, which then results in longer upload times when reporting the map. If map reporting time is unreasonably long, the agent can compress the map prior to transfer. To enable compressed map uploads, add the following to your app's newrelic.properties file: com.newrelic.compressed_uploads=true Copy Deferred crash reporting Important Agent version 6.0.0 introduces changes to the way the agent plugin processes crashes at runtime. In an attempt to address crash report duplication, deferred crash reporting is now the default crash reporting behavior. In this case, crash reports are recorded when they occur, but they're not uploaded until the next application launch. The previous crash reporting behavior is still available: uploading the crash as soon as it occurs before the application process terminates. You can use the NewRelic.withCrashReportingEnabled(boolean) API method. For example: NewRelic .withApplicationToken(\"<appToken>\") .withCrashReportingEnabled(true) .start(this.getApplication()); Copy Disable crash reporting If you want to use another crash reporting tool, you can disable crash reporting by calling NewRelic.disableFeature(FeatureFlag.CrashReporting) prior to agent initialization. For example: NewRelic.disableFeature(FeatureFlag.CrashReporting); NewRelic .withApplicationToken(\"<appToken>\") .start(this.getApplication()); Copy Debug the crash reporter Crash reporting for Android is designed to work with other crash reporting frameworks by chaining the uncaught exception handler if it is already registered. If no other framework has been found (or if New Relic is the first framework registered), the debug logs will include: Installing New Relic crash handler. Copy If another handler is already registered, debug logs will include: Installing New Relic crash handler and chaining previous exception handler. Copy Every time New Relic catches an exception, it is logged to DEBUG level. For example: A crash has been detected in <className>. Copy If New Relic catches an exception but crash reporting has been disabled for any reason, this message is logged: A crash has been detected but crash reporting is disabled. Copy If you don't see crash reports, check the debug logs for messages like this. Manually upload a ProGuard or DexGuard map file In some unusual circumstances, it may not be possible to automatically upload the ProGuard or DexGuard mapping file. This is often due to incorrectly creating a newrelic.properties file containing your application token. This will result in build errors or warnings with detailed log messages. To manually upload a ProGuard or DexGuard map file: Find the mapping.txt file(s) in the project's build directory For example, the file is located in the <PROJECT_ROOT>/app/build/outputs/mapping/<BUILD_VARIANT> directory for projects that use Android Studio. Generally, a release variant is used when building the final version of the application. The following command is useful for finding map files: find <project_root> -name mapping.txt Copy Using a command terminal, upload the ProGuard or DexGuard mapping file: For a US account: curl -v -F upload=@\"<mapping.txt>\" -H \"X-APP-LICENSE-KEY:<APPLICATION_TOKEN>\" https://mobile-symbol-upload.newrelic.com/symbol Copy For a EU account: curl -v -F upload=@\"<mapping.txt>\" -H \"X-APP-LICENSE-KEY:<APPLICATION_TOKEN>\" https://mobile-symbol-upload.eu.newrelic.com/symbol Copy Replace the following in your command: <mapping.txt> is the full path to the ProGuard or DexGuard mapping.txt file. <APPLICATION_TOKEN> is your mobile monitoring application token.",

      "body": "You can tailor the Node.js agent to your app's requirements by editing your newrelic.js config file or by setting an environment variable. The config file resides in the root directory of your app. You can also configure a few options from New Relic, or use the Node.js agent API. Important The license_key setting is required. We highly recommend setting the app_name so that your app has a meaningful name instead of the default My Application. Configuration methods and precedence The primary method to configure the Node.js agent is the agent configuration file (newrelic.js). You can also configure most settings with environment variables. You can also adjust some settings with server-side configuration. The Node.js agent uses this order of precedence for configuration methods: Node.js configuration hierarchy: Server-side configuration settings override environment variables. Environment variables override the agent config file. The config file overrides the agent defaults. Here are detailed descriptions of each configuration method: Agent configuration file The config file (newrelic.js) contains every Node.js agent setting. When you install the Node.js agent, you must copy newrelic.js into your app's root directory. Most settings are empty by default; they inherit their values from config/default.js. Environment variables Most configuration settings in newrelic.js have equivalent environment variables. These are useful, for example, if your agent runs in a PaaS environment such as Heroku or Microsoft Azure. Node.js agent environment variables always start with NEW_RELIC_. Where available, these environment variables are documented below under individual config options as the Environ variable. There are also two rarely used settings that can only be configured via environment variables. Server-side configuration Owners and Admins can view and configure a few settings directly in New Relic. Where available, the UI labels for server-side config are listed in this document under individual config options as the Server-side label. Exports variables This section defines the Node.js agent variables in the order they typically appear in the exports.config = { section of your app's newrelic.js configuration file. app_name (REQUIRED) Type String Default \"My Application\" Environ variable NEW_RELIC_APP_NAME The name New Relic uses to identify your app. For example, app_name: ['MyNodeApp']. To use multiple names for your app, specify a comma-delimited list of names. Data for all applications with the same name will be merged in the New Relic UI, so set this carefully. We highly recommend that you replace the default name with a descriptive name to avoid confusion and unintended aggregation of data. Tip For Azure users, the Node.js agent will use APP_POOL_ID if it is set, so you can use the name you chose for your Azure Web Server without setting it twice. license_key (REQUIRED) Type String Default (none) Environ variable NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY This setting is required. Your New Relic license key. For example, license_key: '40HexadecimalCharacters'. agent_enabled Type Boolean Default true Environ variable NEW_RELIC_ENABLED Set to false to stop the agent from starting up. This is useful when debugging your code requires temporarily disabling the agent. It prevents the agent from bootstrapping its instrumentation or setting up all its pieces, which prevents the agent from starting up and connecting to New Relic's servers. allow_all_headers If true, enables capture of all HTTP headers, except for those filtered by exclude rules. If false, collected headers are limited to those defined in Node.js agent attributes. Type Boolean Default false Caution Any header-related include/exclude rules must be in camelCase form to be filtered. apdex_t (DEPRECATED) Type Number Default 0.100 Server-side label Apdex T Set your Apdex T via the New Relic UI. certificates Type Array of strings Default (none) Additional certificates to trust for SSL connections, specified as an array of strings in PEM format. This affects both connections to an HTTPS proxy and connections to New Relic. Tip You can also configure the agent to read its certificates from a file: certificates: [ fs.readFileSync('myca.crt', {encoding: 'utf8'}) ] Copy high_security Type Boolean Default false Environ variable NEW_RELIC_HIGH_SECURITY When set to true, enables high security v2. You must also enable the ssl setting and enable high security in the UI. host Type String Default collector.newrelic.com Environ variable NEW_RELIC_HOST Important Do not edit this value unless New Relic Support asks you to change it. Hostname for the New Relic collector to connect to the Internet; for example, host: 'collector.newrelic.com'. labels Adds tags. Specify your tags as objects or a semicolon-delimited string of colon-separated pairs (for example, Server:One;Data Center:Primary). Type Object or string Default (none) Environ variable NEW_RELIC_LABELS port Type Integer Default 443 Environ variable NEW_RELIC_PORT Important Do not edit this value unless New Relic Support asks you to change it. Port number to connect to the New Relic collector; for example, port: 443. proxy Type String Default (none) Environ variable NEW_RELIC_PROXY_URL A URL specifying the proxy server to connect to the Internet. For example, proxy: 'http://user:pass@10.0.0.1:8000/'. Important The proxy config file setting overrides the other config file proxy settings (proxy_host, proxy_port, proxy_user, proxy_pass) if used. Similarly, the NEW_RELIC_PROXY_URL environment variable overrides the other environment variable proxy settings (NEW_RELIC_PROXY_HOST, NEW_RELIC_PROXY_PORT, NEW_RELIC_PROXY_USER, and NEW_RELIC_PROXY_PASS) if used. proxy_host Type String Default (none) Environ variable NEW_RELIC_PROXY_HOST Hostname or IP address of the proxy server to connect to the Internet. proxy_pass Type String Default (none) Environ variable NEW_RELIC_PROXY_PASS Password for authenticating to the proxy server. The agent supports only basic HTTP authentication. proxy_port Type String Default (none) Environ variable NEW_RELIC_PROXY_PORT Port number of the proxy server to connect to the Internet. proxy_user Type String Default (none) Environ variable NEW_RELIC_PROXY_USER User name for authenticating to the proxy server. The agent supports only basic HTTP authentication. Logging variables This section defines the Node.js agent variables in the order they typically appear in the logging: { section of your app's newrelic.js configuration file. enabled Type String Default true (false in serverless_mode) Environ variable NEW_RELIC_LOG_ENABLED Enables or disables agent specific logging. level Type String Default info Environ variable NEW_RELIC_LOG_LEVEL Defines the level of detail recorded in the agent logs. From least detail to most detail, possible values are fatal, error, warn, info, debug, or trace. Caution Do not use debug or trace logging unless New Relic Support asks you to use them. These levels of logging can generate excessive overhead. For most situations, use info. filepath Type String Default process.cwd() plus newrelic_agent.log Environ variable NEW_RELIC_LOG Complete path to the New Relic agent log, including the filename. Defaults to filepath: require('path').join(process.cwd(), 'newrelic_agent.log'). The agent will shut down the process if it cannot create this file. The agent creates a log file with the same permissions as the parent Node.js agent process. To write all logging to stdout, set this to stdout. To write all logging to stderr, set this to stderr. Audit logging This section defines the Node.js agent variables in the order they typically appear in the audit_log: { section of your app's newrelic.js configuration file. enabled Type Boolean Default false Environ variable NEW_RELIC_AUDIT_LOG_ENABLED When enabled, the agent logs the payloads it sends to the collector. This data is included in the main log file even when logging level is set to the lowest level. endpoints Type Array Default Empty array (include all types) Environ variable NEW_RELIC_AUDIT_LOG_ENDPOINTS The agent sends several different types of data to the collector in separate payloads. By default, all of them are included in the log file. This option makes it possible to limit logging only to specific types of data. Valid values include: agent_settings analytic_event_data connect custom_event_data error_data error_event_data metric_data preconnect shutdown span_event_data sql_trace_data transaction_sample_data API configuration This section allows you to choose which API methods are enabled. Each configuration option allows you to modularly enable API methods that are responsible for sending custom information to New Relic. Important All of these are set to false when the agent is in high security mode. custom_attributes_enabled Type Boolean Default true Environ variable NEW_RELIC_API_CUSTOM_ATTRIBUTES This option enables newrelic.addCustomAttribute and newrelic.addCustomAttributes. custom_events_enabled Type Boolean Default true Environ variable NEW_RELIC_API_CUSTOM_EVENTS This option enables recordCustomEvent. notice_error_enabled Type Boolean Default true Environ variable NEW_RELIC_API_NOTICE_ERROR This option enables newrelic.noticeError. Attributes This section defines the variables for Node.js agent attributes in the order they typically appear in the attributes: { section of your app's newrelic.js configuration file. Caution Any header-related include/exclude rules must be in camelCase form to be filtered. enabled Type Boolean Default true Environ variable NEW_RELIC_ATTRIBUTES_ENABLED If true, enables capture of attributes for all destinations. exclude Type Array Default [] Environ variable NEW_RELIC_ATTRIBUTES_EXCLUDE Prefix of attributes to exclude from all destinations. Allows * as wildcard at end. include Type Array Default [] Environ variable NEW_RELIC_ATTRIBUTES_INCLUDE Prefix of attributes to include from all destinations. Allows * as wildcard at end. include_enabled Type Boolean Default true Environ variable NEW_RELIC_ATTRIBUTES_INCLUDE_ENABLED When true, patterns may be added to the attributes.include list. Error collector variables You can manage how error are handled in New Relic. This section defines the Node.js agent variables in the order they typically appear in the error_collector: { section of your app's newrelic.js configuration file. enabled Type Boolean Default true Environ variable NEW_RELIC_ERROR_COLLECTOR_ENABLED Server-side label Enable error collection? When enabled, the agent collects error traces from your app. ignore_status_codes Type Array Default 404 Environ variable NEW_RELIC_ERROR_COLLECTOR_IGNORE_ERROR_CODES Server-side label Ignore these status codes Comma-delimited list of HTTP status codes for the error collector to ignore. Caution Errors recorded using newrelic.noticeError do not obey this configuration value. ignore_classes Type Array|Object Default [] Environ variable NEW_RELIC_ERROR_COLLECTOR_IGNORE_ERRORS Comma-delimited list of javascript error types/classes for the error collector to ignore. The following configuration /* ... */ error_collector: { ignore_classes: [\"ReferenceError\"] } /* ... */ Copy Would ignore all reference errors. Caution Errors recorded using newrelic.noticeError do not obey this configuration value. ignore_messages Type Object Default {} A javascript object describing a list of javascript classes tied to javascript error messages for the collector to ignore. The following configuration. /* ... */ error_collector: { /* ... */ ignore_messages: {\"Error\":[\"Undefined\", \"Out of time\"]} /* ... */ } /* ... */ Copy Would ignore all errors of type Error, with the exact (case-sensitive) message strings of Undefined and Out of time. Caution Errors recorded using newrelic.noticeError do not obey this configuration value. expected_status_codes Type Array Default [] Environ variable NEW_RELIC_ERROR_COLLECTOR_EXPECTED_ERROR_CODES Comma-delimited list of HTTP status codes for the error collector to mark as expected. Caution Errors recorded using newrelic.noticeError do not obey this configuration value. expected_classes Type Array Default [] Environ variable NEW_RELIC_ERROR_COLLECTOR_EXPECTED_ERRORS The following configuration /* ... */ error_collector: { expected_classes: [\"ReferenceError\"] } /* ... */ Copy Would mark all reference errors as expected. Caution Errors recorded using newrelic.noticeError do not obey this configuration value. expected_messages Type Object Default {} A javascript object describing a list of javascript classes tied to javascript error messages for the collector to ignore. The following configuration. /* ... */ error_collector: { /* ... */ expected_messages: {\"Error\":[\"Undefined\", \"Out of time\"]} /* ... */ } /* ... */ Copy Would mark all errors of type Error, with the exact (case-sensitive) message strings of Undefined and Out of time. Caution Errors recorded using newrelic.noticeError do not obey this configuration value. attributes.enabled Type Boolean Default true Environ variable NEW_RELIC_ERROR_COLLECTOR_ATTRIBUTES_ENABLED If true, the agent captures attributes from error collection. Caution Any header-related include/exclude rules must be in camelCase form to be filtered. attributes.exclude Type Array Default [] Environ variable NEW_RELIC_ERROR_COLLECTOR_ATTRIBUTES_EXCLUDE Prefix of attributes to exclude from error collection. Allows * as wildcard at end. attributes.include Type Array Default [] Environ variable NEW_RELIC_ERROR_COLLECTOR_ATTRIBUTES_INCLUDE Prefix of attributes to include in error collection. Allows * as wildcard at end. max_event_samples_stored Type Integer Default 100 Environ variable NEW_RELIC_ERROR_COLLECTOR_MAX_EVENT_SAMPLES_STORED Defines the maximum number of events the agent collects per minute. If there are more than this number, the agent collects a statistical sampling. Transaction tracer variables The agent groups your requests into transactions, which are used to: Visualize where your app spends its time (in transaction breakdowns). Identify slow requests. Group metrics. Isolate other issues, such as slow database performance. This section defines the Node.js agent variables in the order they typically appear in the transaction_tracer: { section of your app's newrelic.js configuration file. Important Do not use brackets [suffix] at the end of your transaction name. New Relic automatically strips brackets from the name. Instead, use parentheses (suffix) or other symbols if needed. enabled Type Boolean Default true Environ variable NEW_RELIC_TRACER_ENABLED Server-side label Enable transaction tracing? When enabled, the agent collects slow transaction traces. explain_threshold Type Integer Default 500 Environ variable NEW_RELIC_EXPLAIN_THRESHOLD Minimum query duration (in milliseconds) for a transaction to be eligible for slow queries in transaction traces. record_sql Type String (off, obfuscated, or raw) Default off Environ variable NEW_RELIC_RECORD_SQL This option affects both slow queries and record_sql for transaction traces. It can have one of three values: off, obfuscated, or raw. When set to off no slow queries will be captured, and backtraces and SQL will not be included in transaction traces. If set to raw or obfuscated, the agent sends raw or obfuscated SQL and a slow query sample to the collector. The agent may also send SQL when other criteria are met, such as when slow_sql.enabled is set. top_n Type Integer Default 20 Environ variable NEW_RELIC_TRACER_TOP_N Defines the maximum number of requests eligible for transaction traces. Transactions are named based on the request, and top_n refers to the \"top n slowest transactions\" grouped by these names. The module replaces a recorded trace with a new trace only if the new trace is slower than the previous slowest trace of that name. The default value for this setting is top_n: 20, because the Transactions page also defaults to the 20 slowest transactions. The Node.js agent captures at least five different slow transactions in the first harvest cycle after start up. It will also reset and capture different transactions if no slow transactions have been captured for the last five harvest cycles. This allows you to see more information about more of your app's request paths, at the possible cost of not focusing on the absolutely slowest request for that harvest cycle. Tip To record the absolute slowest transaction over the last minute, you can set top_n: 0 or top_n: 1. However, this causes one very slow route to dominate your transaction traces. transaction_threshold Type Integer or apdex_f Default apdex_f Environ variable NEW_RELIC_TRACER_THRESHOLD Server-side label Threshold Threshold of web transaction response time in seconds beyond which a transaction is eligible for transaction tracing. The default value is apdex_f; this sets the trace threshold to four times your application's Apdex T. You can also enter a specific time value in milliseconds. Example: Threshold set to apdex_f The default apdex_t is 100 milliseconds. If your transaction threshold is set to apdex_f, a \"slow\" transaction is 400 milliseconds. hide_internals Type boolean Default true Environ variable NEW_RELIC_HIDE_INTERNALS The agent uses a small amount of CPU in order to hide internal properties that are attached to the web application. If you change this configuration to false, it may slightly decrease your agent overhead, but it could also have an impact on the performance of the agent. attributes.enabled Type Boolean Default true Environ variable NEW_RELIC_TRANSACTION_TRACER_ATTRIBUTES_ENABLED If true, the agent captures attributes from transaction traces. Caution Any header-related include/exclude rules must be in camelCase form to be filtered. attributes.exclude Type Array Default [] Environ variable NEW_RELIC_TRANSACTION_TRACER_ATTRIBUTES_EXCLUDE Prefix of attributes to exclude from transaction traces. Allows * as wildcard at end. attributes.include Type Array Default [] Environ variable NEW_RELIC_TRANSACTION_TRACER_ATTRIBUTES_INCLUDE Prefix of attributes to include in transaction traces. Allows * as wildcard at end. Rules variables This section defines the Node.js agent variables in the order they typically appear in the rules: { section of your app's newrelic.js configuration file. name Type Strings or regular expressions Default (none) Environ variable NEW_RELIC_NAMING_RULES A comma-delimited list of rules to match incoming request URLs and name the associated New Relic transaction. Uses the format: name: [ {pattern: 'STRING_OR_REGEX', name: 'NAME'}, {pattern: 'STRING_OR_REGEX', name: 'NAME'} ], Copy Both parameters are required. For strings, you must escape control characters. You do not need to escape control characters in regular expressions. Additional attributes are ignored. Regular expressions support JavaScript-style capture groups, and names use $1-style replacement strings. Regular expressions only find the first matching result; subsequent matches are ignored. For more information, see Node.js transaction naming API. For the NEW_RELIC_NAMING_RULES environment variable, pass the rules as comma-delimited JSON object literals: NEW_RELIC_NAMING_RULES='{\"pattern\":\"^t\",\"name\":\"u\"},{\"pattern\":\"^u\",\"name\":\"t\"}' Copy ignore Type Strings or regular expressions Default Regular expression to match socket.io long-polling requests (\"^ \\ /socket \\ .io \\ /. * \\ /xhr-polling/\"). Environ variable NEW_RELIC_IGNORING_RULES Define a list of request URLs you want the agent to ignore. Specify the list as patterns, which can be strings or regular expressions. enforce_backstop Type Boolean Default true Environ variable NEW_RELIC_ENFORCE_BACKSTOP Caution Do not change this setting unless you understand metric grouping issues. When enabled, the agent renames transactions that are not affected by other naming logic (such as the API, rules, or metric normalization rules) to NormalizedUri/*. If you set this to false, the agent sets transaction names to Uri/path/to/resource. Transaction events variables This section defines the Node.js agent variables in the order they typically appear in the transaction_events: { section of your app's newrelic.js configuration file. enabled Type Boolean Default true When enabled, the agent sends transaction events to New Relic. This event data includes transaction timing, transaction name, and any custom parameters. If this is disabled, the agent does not collect this data or send it to New Relic. max_samples_stored Type Integer Default 10000 Environ variable NEW_RELIC_TRANSACTION_EVENTS_MAX_SAMPLES_STORED Defines the maximum number of events the agent collects per minute. If there are more than this number, the agent collects a statistical sampling. We do not recommend configuring past 10,000. The server will cap data at 10,000 per-minute. Important This configuration had different behavior in agent versions lower than 6.0.0. See max_samples_stored (DEPRECATED) for agent versions 5.x or lower. max_samples_stored (DEPRECATED) Type Integer Default 20000 Defines the maximum number of events the agent stores if it is unable to communicate with the New Relic collector. The values from the previous harvest cycle will be merged into the next one, with this option limiting the maximum number. Make sure this number is greater than max_samples_per_minute; for example, set it to twice as much. Consider your memory overhead before increasing this value. Caution This configuration has different behavior starting with agent version 6.0.0 and a new recommended maximum. See max_samples_stored for agent versions 6.x or higher. max_samples_per_minute (DEPRECATED) Type Integer Default 10000 Defines the maximum number of events the agent collects per minute. If there are more than this number, the agent collects a statistical sampling. Caution This configuration has been replaced with max_samples_stored starting with version 6.0.0 of the agent. See max_samples_stored for 6.x or later agents. attributes.enabled Type Boolean Default true Environ variable NEW_RELIC_TRANSACTION_EVENTS_ATTRIBUTES_ENABLED If true, the agent captures attributes from transaction events. Caution Any header-related include/exclude rules must be in camelCase form to be filtered. attributes.exclude Type Array Default [] Environ variable NEW_RELIC_TRANSACTION_EVENTS_ATTRIBUTES_EXCLUDE Prefix of attributes to exclude from transaction events. Allows * as wildcard at end. attributes.include Type Array Default [] Environ variable NEW_RELIC_TRANSACTION_EVENTS_ATTRIBUTES_INCLUDE Prefix of attributes to include in transaction events. Allows * as wildcard at end. Browser monitoring variables This section defines the Node.js agent variables in the order they typically appear in the browser_monitoring: { section of your app's newrelic.js configuration file. enable Type Boolean Default true Environ variable NEW_RELIC_BROWSER_MONITOR_ENABLE Server-side label Enable browser monitoring? Generate JavaScript headers for browser instrumentation. Although this defaults to true, the agent doesn't inject the browser JS code unless you have enabled browser monitoring. Even if you have enabled it and added the browser timing header, you can disable browser monitoring for your app by setting this to false. debug Type Boolean Default false Environ variable NEW_RELIC_BROWSER_MONITOR_DEBUG If true, request un-minified sources from the server. attributes.enabled Type Boolean Default false Environ variable NEW_RELIC_BROWSER_MONITORING_ATTRIBUTES_ENABLED If true, the agent sends custom attributes to browser monitoring. Caution Any header-related include/exclude rules must be in camelCase form to be filtered. attributes.exclude Type Array Default [] Environ variable NEW_RELIC_BROWSER_MONITORING_ATTRIBUTES_EXCLUDE Prefix of attributes to exclude from browser monitoring. Allows * as wildcard at end. attributes.include Type Array Default [] Environ variable NEW_RELIC_BROWSER_MONITORING_ATTRIBUTES_INCLUDE Prefix of attributes to include in browser monitoring. Allows * as wildcard at end. Custom events variables This section defines the Node.js agent variables in the order they typically appear in the custom_insights_events: { section of your app's newrelic.js configuration file. Currently there are no environment variables for custom events. enabled Type Boolean Default true When enabled, the agent sends custom events recorded with recordCustomEvent() to New Relic. If this is disabled, the agent does not collect this data or send it to New Relic. max_samples_stored Type Integer Default 1000 Environ variable NEW_RELIC_CUSTOM_INSIGHTS_EVENTS_MAX_SAMPLES_STORED Defines the maximum number of custom events the agent collects per minute. If the number of custom events exceeds this limit, the agent collects a statistical sampling. Important Increasing this limit increases memory usage. Slow queries variables This section defines the Node.js agent variables in the order they typically appear in the slow_sql: { section of your app's newrelic.js configuration file. These options control behavior for slow queries, but do not affect SQL nodes in transaction traces. enabled Type Boolean Default false Environ variable NEW_RELIC_SLOW_SQL_ENABLED When enabled, the agent collects slow query details. max_samples Type Integer Default 10 Environ variable NEW_RELIC_MAX_SQL_SAMPLES Defines the maximum number of slow queries the agent collects per minute. The agent discards additional queries after the limit is reached. Important Increasing this limit increases memory usage. Custom hostname variables This section defines the Node.js agent variables in the order they typically appear in the process_host: { section of your app's newrelic.js configuration file. These options control behavior regarding the host display name in the APM UI. display_name Type String of 255 bytes or less Default (none) Environ variable NEW_RELIC_PROCESS_HOST_DISPLAY_NAME Specify a custom hostname for display in New Relic. If you do not set this field, New Relic will continue to use the default hostname found by calling os.hostname(). If you use the default hostname settings, New Relic finds the hostname through os.hostname(). If this call fails, New Relic uses the host's IP as the name. If you set ipv_preference: 4 or ipv_preference: 6, you can select the type of IP address (IPv4 or IPv6) that appears in the New Relic UI. ipv_preference Type Integer (4 or 6) Default 4 Environ variable NEW_RELIC_IPV_PREFERENCE Environment variable overrides This section defines two configuration options only available with environment variables. These overrides are not used in most configurations. NEW_RELIC_HOME Path to the directory containing newrelic.js. This is available only as an environment variable. You cannot set it in your config file. Type String Default (none) NEW_RELIC_NO_CONFIG_FILE If used, this prevents the agent from reading configuration settings from newrelic.js. Default values and values from environment variables will still be set. This is available only as an environment variable. You cannot set it in your config file. Type Boolean Default False Datastore tracer variables This section defines the Node.js agent variables in the order they typically appear in the datastore_tracer section of your app's newrelic.js configuration file. These options control behavior for collecting datastore instance metrics. instance_reporting.enabled Type Boolean Default true When enabled, the agent collects datastore instance metrics (such as host and port) for some database drivers. These are reported on slow query traces and transaction traces. database_name_reporting.enabled Type Boolean Default true When enabled, the agent collects database name on slow query traces and transaction traces for some database drivers. Cross application tracing (DEPRECATED) The Node.js agent variables that control cross application tracing typically appear in the cross_application_tracer section of your app's newrelic.js configuration file: enabled Type Boolean Default false When set to true, allows tracing of transactions across more than one New Relic-monitored applications. Important Cross application tracing (CAT) has been deprecated and will be removed in a future major release. For cross-service visibility, we recommend using distributed tracing, which is enabled by default as of agent version 8.3.0. Before enabling, read the transition guide. Error message redaction variables The Node.js agent variables that control error message redaction appear in the allow_raw_exception_messages section of your app's newrelic.js configuration file: enabled Type Boolean Default true Environ variable NEW_RELIC_ALLOW_RAW_EXCEPTION_MESSAGES_ENABLED When false, the agent will redact the messages of captured errors. Distributed tracing Important Enabling distributed tracing disables cross application tracing, and has effects on other APM features. Before enabling, read the transition guide. Requires Node.js agent version 4.7.0 or higher. Distributed tracing lets you see the path that a request takes as it travels through a distributed system. When configuring via the config file, place the following option in the distributed_tracing section. enabled Type Boolean Default true Environ variable NEW_RELIC_DISTRIBUTED_TRACING_ENABLED Set this to true to enable distributed tracing. For example, to enable this in the config file, you would use: distributed_tracing: { enabled: true } Copy exclude_newrelic_header Type Boolean Default false Set this to true to exclude the New Relic header that is attached to outbound requests, and instead only rely on W3C Trace Context Headers for distributed tracing. If this is false then both types of headers are used. For example, to enable this in the config file, you would use: distributed_tracing:{ enabled: true, exclude_newrelic_header: true } Copy Span events Span data is reported for distributed tracing. Distributed tracing must be enabled to report spans. Span configuration is set in the span_events stanza. Options include: enabled Type Boolean Default true Environ variable NEW_RELIC_SPAN_EVENTS_ENABLED Turns reporting of span events on or off. attributes.enabled Type Boolean Default true Environ variable NEW_RELIC_SPAN_EVENTS_ATTRIBUTES_ENABLED This setting can be used to turn reporting of attributes on or off for spans. If attributes.enabled at the root level is false, no attributes will be sent with spans regardless on how this is set. attributes.include Type Array Default [] Environ variable NEW_RELIC_SPAN_EVENTS_ATTRIBUTES_INCLUDE If attributes are enabled for spans, all attribute keys found in this list will be attached to spans. For more information, see the agent attribute rules. attributes.exclude Type Array Default [] Environ variable NEW_RELIC_SPAN_EVENTS_ATTRIBUTES_EXCLUDE All attribute keys found in this list will not be sent with spans. For more information, see the agent attribute rules. max_samples_stored Type Integer Default 2000 Environ variable NEW_RELIC_SPAN_EVENTS_MAX_SAMPLES_STORED Defines the maximum number of events the agent collects per minute. If there are more than this number, the agent collects a statistical sampling. We do not recommend configuring past 10k. The server will cap data at 10k per-minute. Infinite Tracing To turn on Infinite Tracing, enable distributed tracing (set distributed_tracing to enabled: true) and add the additional settings below. For an example, see Language agents: configure distributed tracing. trace_observer.host Type String Default (none) Environ variable NEW_RELIC_INFINITE_TRACING_TRACE_OBSERVER_HOST For help getting a valid Infinite Tracing trace observer host entry, see Find or create a trace observer endpoint.",

      "body": "Attributes are key-value pairs containing information that determines the properties of an event or transaction. You can view these key-value pairs in some places in the UI, or by querying that data using NRQL. New Relic gives users the ability to customize exactly which attributes will be sent to each of these destinations. You can also collect custom attributes to send additional data to New Relic. Attribute destination flow This diagram illustrates how an agent decides to send attributes to each destination. Agent attribute collection: An agent makes three different decisions when sending an attribute to any New Relic destination based on the relevant property settings. Property names and syntax vary by agent. (The properties in this diagram are specific to the PHP agent, but the general flow is the same for all agents. Property names and syntax vary by agent.) Types of attributes Attributes can be collected in a variety of ways: Message property attributes: These are the properties set on a message received from a queue or topic. HTTP request attributes: These are the parameters for an HTTP request. User attributes: These are attributes provided by the user through each agent's API. Agent attributes: These are attributes captured by the agent; for example, httpResponseCode and httpResponseMessage. Destinations for attributes Collected attributes appear in these locations: Collected attributes Location Transaction traces Each minute transaction traces collect data for your slowest individual HTTP requests. These traces will report attributes collected during the transaction. Traced errors If a transaction results in an error, these traced errors will be reported to APM. A traced error will contain attributes collected during the transaction. Transaction events APM transactions will contain attributes collected during the transaction. Insights page views Browser page views will contain attributes collected during the transaction. However, attributes collected at the end of a transaction may not appear on PageView events. This destination is also called browser monitoring. Span events Span events collected for distributed tracing will contain attributes collected during the span. The following agents support the addition of custom user attributes to span events: Java agent 5.13.0 and above Go agent 3.6.0 and above .NET agent 8.25 and above Node agent 6.10.0 and above PHP agent 9.12.0.268 and above Python agent 5.8.0.136 and above Ruby agent 6.8.0 and above Transaction segments Each segment in a transaction trace will contain attributes recorded for that segment. Viewing request attributes Request attributes are associated with specific transaction traces, browser traces, and errors in APM and dashboards. You can see the attributes recorded with a request when viewing the individual trace or error. Custom attributes can be queried via NRQL exactly like any other attribute. APM > (select an app) > Monitoring > Transactions > (select a transaction) > (select a trace): Here is an example from the Ruby agent of the Request attributes and Custom attributes for a transaction trace. Exact attributes depend on your agent and on your attribute configuration. Limits User attributes, request attributes, and message queue parameters are limited by count and size. Parameter Limitations Transaction Limited to 64 user attributes Attribute key Limited to 256 bytes each If the key is more than 256 bytes, then the attribute will not be recorded. Attribute value Limited to 256 bytes each If the value is greater than 256 bytes, then the attribute value will be truncated. Agent-specific attributes Each APM agent collects custom attributes. The supported attributes depend on the specific agent: C SDK Go Java .NET Node.js PHP Python Ruby",

This is located in the top right of most New Relic UI pages. For more on factors that affect access to accounts, see Factors affecting access. To find account settings, use the account dropdown. administrator A type of user role on a New Relic account. For more information, see Users. agent At New Relic, an agent is a piece of monitoring software that provides integrations with various technologies (for example, web frameworks, host operating systems, or database types). The agents send that data to New Relic, usually on a specific cadence. For more information, see: New Relic integrations Install agents agent API Some New Relic agents have agent APIs that allow you to extend the functionality of an agent. You can use the API to control, customize and extend the functionality of the agent. Here are some agent API docs: APM agents: C SDK API Go agent API Java agent API .NET agent API Node.js agent API PHP agent API Ruby agent API Python agent API Browser agent: Browser agent API Mobile agents: iOS SDK API Android SDK API aggregated metrics Aggregated metric data summarizes calls to specific methods in your application, including how many times each one was called and response times. In the New Relic UI, you see the class and method names along with their aggregate numbers. Metric data aggregation depends on the New Relic tool and your subscription level. For more information, see the documentation about data retention. aggregation function You can use NRQL query function, such as sum(), average(), or latest() to choose how the data points in an aggregation window should be processed into a single data point. The single aggregated data point is what's passed through the alert evaluation process. aggregation window Streaming alerts gathers data together into specific amounts of time. These windows of time are customizable. Data points are collected together based their timestamps and reported as a batch. The customizable aggregation window provides greater flexibility and fewer false violations when alerting on irregular or less frequent data points. alert An alert communicates an event or incident that designated personnel can track through Alerts. For an explanation of how basic alerts concepts are related, see Concepts and workflow. alert condition An alert condition (or condition), identified by its unique numeric condition_id, contains the criteria for creating a violation. The condition includes the threshold that is set for a metric timeslice or a custom metric over time on a chosen target. For an explanation of how a condition relates to other basic alerts concepts, see Concepts and workflow. alert evaluation Streaming data is assessed on a set of aggregation windows to determine if an alert condition is violating or recovering. The aggregation window time is how long we'll collect data before running the NRQL query condition. The offset evaluation time is how long you want us to wait for late data before assessing it. If a window doesn't have any data points, it's treated as a gap for loss of signal. alert policy A collection of one or more conditions, one or more notification channels, and an Incident preference setting. If a condition contained within the policy opens a violation, an incident may be opened depending on the Incident preference setting. Notifications will then be sent to all channels attached to the policy. For an explanation of how a policy relates to other basic alerts concepts, see Concepts and workflow. apdex Apdex is an industry-standard way to measure users' satisfaction with the response time of an application or service. New Relic rates each response as Satisfied, Tolerated, or Frustrated, and uses these ratings to calculate an overall user satisfaction score. For more information, see Apdex: Measure user satisfaction. apdex_f The response time above which a transaction are rated frustrating. Defaults to four times apdex_t. Requests that complete in less than apdex_t are rated satisfied. Requests that take longer than apdex_t, but less than four times apdex_t (apdex_f), are tolerated. Any requests that take longer than apdex_f are rated frustrating. For more information, see Apdex: Measure user satisfaction. apdex_t The response time above which a transaction is considered tolerable. The default value is 0.5 seconds, but you can change this in your Apdex settings. Requests that complete in less than apdex_t are rated satisfied. Requests that take more than apdex_t, but less than apdex_f, are tolerated. Any requests that take longer than apdex_f are rated frustrating. For more information, see Apdex: Measure user satisfaction. API (application programming interface) New Relic offers a variety of APIs and SDKs. For more information, see the introduction to New Relic's APIs. APM New Relic's APM (application performance monitoring) provides monitoring of your web or non-web application's performance. APM supports apps using several programming languages. application For New Relic purposes, any program instrumented by New Relic. application ID Some New Relic solutions assign a monitored application a unique application ID, often shortened to app ID. When present, this ID is available in the UI. It is also reported as an attribute and can be queried. For how to determine this, see Find app ID. application name The name that New Relic combines with your license key to uniquely identify a particular app. For more information, see Name your application. Applied Intelligence (AI) Applied Intelligence (AI) helps you find, troubleshoot, and resolve problems more quickly. Specifically, it’s a hybrid machine learning engine that reduces alert noise, correlates incidents, and automatically detects anomalies. Applied Intelligence includes Alerts, Incident Intelligence, and Proactive Detection. attribute Attributes are key-value pairs attached to data objects reported to New Relic. Attributes add detail, and they're similar to tags or labels in other SaaS software. You can explore this data by querying or searching via the UI or by using the data dictionary. Examples: APM reports a Transaction event. This includes timing data for the transaction in a duration attribute, which might have a value of .002. Our Infrastructure Monitoring reports a ProcessSample event. This includes a variety of CPU usage attributes, including a cpuSystemPercent attribute, which might have a value of .01. Our Telemetry SDK reports a Metric data type for storing metrics, with attached attributes like metricName and newrelic.source. Some New Relic tools allow you to report custom attributes to enhance your monitoring. For more information about attributes in APM, see Agent attributes. availability monitoring See Types of Synthetics monitors. browser The New Relic UI supports most browsers. For more information, see Supported browsers. For our end-user browser monitoring tool, see Browser Monitoring. Browser monitoring A Real User Monitoring (RUM) solution that measures the speed and performance of your end users as they navigate to your site from different web browsers, devices, operating systems, and networks. background external See web external. child account See parent account. cloud-based integration New Relic offers cloud-based integrations with providers such as Amazon Web Services (AWS), Microsoft Azure, and Google Cloud Platform. collector The component that collects data from New Relic agents running on an app server, mobile device, or end-user browser. While the agent is installed on a user's app server, the collectors are centrally located in New Relic's data center. In order to contact the collector, the agent must be able to reach New Relic's domains and IP addresses. (The exact domain or IP depends on the New Relic monitoring tool.) The collector receives and interprets this data, and stores it in a database. The data is then retrieved and presented in the New Relic UI and by our various REST APIs. Command line interface (CLI) Our command line interface (CLI) is a tool you can use to build a New Relic application. This is the same tool our own engineers use. Go here for quick start instructions. Go to our Developer site for sample apps and guides. compute unit (CU) A unit of measurement that determines your pricing for some New Relic products governed by our original product-based pricing plan. For more information, see Compute unit pricing. condition_id See alert condition. CPM (calls per minute) The number of calls your application receives each minute. This usually corresponds to the number of page views or external connections, and is usually the same as RPM (requests per minute). CPU burn The time consumed by code minus the wait time for a transaction. This is the time actually spent processing the transaction. It appears in the New Relic UI at the top of the transaction view for the agents that provide it (Ruby and PHP only). custom attribute A key-value pair added to a transaction or event in order to gain additional information about it. For more information, see custom attributes. custom dashboard A customizable dashboard with charts and tables that includes data from multiple New Relic data sources. For more information, see dashboards. custom event An event, in New Relic terms, is a data object with attached attributes. New Relic reports default event types, like Transaction and TransactionError. You can also create your own events. Events can be queried, and are used in some other features. You can generate custom events with APM agents, with the Browser agent, with the mobile monitoring agents, and via the Event API. Alternatively, you can add custom attributes to some existing default New Relic events. custom instrumentation Custom instrumentation allows you to extend New Relic's monitoring to instrument code elements New Relic doesn't automatically instrument. Custom instrumentation is useful when your framework is not supported by New Relic, or when New Relic fails to pick up some element of your program. You can also use custom instrumentation to block a transaction from being reported entirely. For more information, see Custom instrumentation. custom metric Metric timeslice data that is manually recorded via an API call. Custom metrics allow you to record arbitrary metrics; for example, timing or computer resource data. All custom metric names must be prefixed with Custom/. For more information, see Custom metrics. Not to be confused with custom instrumentation data. data collector See collector. data explorer Use the data explorer to access, query and customize your data, create visualizations, and make connections between your services in a consistent and curated experience. For more on using the data explorer, see Introduction to the data explorer. degradation period When a data source enters a violating state, a degradation period of time begins. The degradation period is set in the condition's threshold. A violation will open if the source stays in a violating state for the entire degradation period. In addition: If the data source enters a non-violating state before the entire time has elapsed, the degradation period countdown is reset, and a violation does not open. If your alert condition threshold is configured as at least once in, the degradation period always lasts a single minute. dimensional metric A dimensional metric is a metric that has multiple attributes, also known as dimensions. At New Relic, we report dimensional metrics using the Metric data type. For more on other metric data types, see Metric data. Docker An open platform for distributed applications, which allows you to assemble multi-container portable apps. Infrastructure Monitoring includes integrated Docker monitoring. For more information about Docker, see the Docker website. downtime The period of time when customers cannot access your site and your app is not reporting to New Relic. For more information, see Synthetic Monitoring and Types of synthetic monitors. entity In New Relic, an entity is anything we can identify that has data you can monitor. An entity can be something you monitor directly, like applications and microservices, or indirectly, like data centers. You can identify one or more entities to be targets for alert conditions. In the Alerts API, the entity being monitored is identified with an entity_id. For more on this, see What are entities? event The word event is a general term that can have many meanings. At New Relic, event can have several meanings: At New Relic, event data is one of our core data types. Event data represents a record of a single event at a particular moment in time. Events can vary by type (for example, Transaction or Mobile, and will have associated attributes (for example, timestamp or transactionName). For more details, see Event data. For our infrastructure monitoring, the word event can be used to refer to important system and host activity. For example, a configuration change for a monitored host would be registered on Infrastructure's Events UI page. For alerts, the Events UI page displays a list of alerts-related incidents for your monitored entities. Events are reported for a violation opening and for closing. In some contexts, event can refer to any NRQL-queryable data type. For example, when you run a NRQL query, you will see a count of inspected events: this refers to a count of all data types queried. expected error An expected error is a common error that you don't want to affect your Apdex score or error rate. For more information, see Manage errors in APM. exporter At New Relic, an exporter is a type of integration that reports telemetry data to New Relic from a third-party (non-New Relic) telemetry tool. For examples, see Exporters, or search our integrations. Flex New Relic Flex is an application-agnostic, all-in-one integration. With it, you can build your own integration that collects metric data from a wide variety of services, and that can instrument any app that exposes metrics over a standard protocol (HTTP, file, shell) in a standard format (for example, JSON or plain text) to the terminal. It's a recommended way to create a custom integration, because it doesn't require coding skills. framework A framework is a structured collection of pre-defined functions, into which an application builder inserts their own code to build their application. A framework is not the same as a library. While a library is a collection of functions you can call as needed, a framework is a skeleton for your application. The functions in that framework then call your functions. For more about the distinction between a framework and a library, see What is the difference between a framework and a library?. New Relic automatically instruments many common frameworks. For more about the frameworks New Relic supports, see the agent-specific documentation: C SDK supported frameworks Go supported frameworks Java supported frameworks .NET supported frameworks Node.js supported frameworks PHP supported frameworks Python supported frameworks Ruby supported frameworks Full-Stack Observability The collection of features and tools you can use to easily analyze and troubleshoot problems across your entire software stack. For more information, read our Introduction to Full-Stack Observability. harvest cycle The period of time between each connection from a New Relic agent to the collector. Between harvest cycles, an agent collects and caches data. At the end of the cycle an agent reports those data to the collector, then begins a new harvest cycle. health status indicator Some New Relic UI pages have a health status indicator appearing next to an index of monitored entities. This is a colored bar (generally green, yellow, red, or gray) indicating the status of your app or other entity monitored by New Relic. It also indicates whether the entity has any alert policies assigned to it and whether there are any policy violations. In general, the colored bar will be green, yellow, red, or gray to indicate the health status. Exceptions: Our REST API (v2) uses orange instead of yellow for the application's health and reporting status. Service maps use different criteria for reporting the health of a connection between an app and an external service not monitored by New Relic (for example, a third party API). host At New Relic, a host means one of the following: A physical machine is a hardware-based device with dedicated physical resources, including memory, processing, and storage. Each machine has its own OS which applications run on. A virtual machine (VM) is the software implementation of a physical machine that executes programs like a physical machine. One or more virtual machines can run on a physical machine. Each virtual machine has its own OS and allocated virtual machine resources such as RAM and CPU. A cloud instance is a type of virtual machine that is run in the public cloud. In this context, virtual machines and cloud instances are different from Java Virtual Machines (JVMs) and containers. host ID Each host identified by APM is assigned a host ID. This ID is used to uniquely identify it, and to retrieve data about that host via the REST API. For more information, see List host ID. ignored error An error that you have told the APM agent not to report to the collector. For more information, see Manage errors in APM. incident An incident is a collection of one or more violations of the conditions defined in an alert policy. An incident record includes all of the open and close time stamps for each violation, as well as chart snapshots of the data being evaluated around the time of each violation. You can view detailed information from the Incidents pages in the user interface. You can also select your preference for how we roll up violations into the incident. For an explanation of how an incident relates to other basic alerts concepts, see Concepts and workflow. Infrastructure monitoring By connecting changes in host performance to changes in your configuration, infrastructure monitoring provides real-time metrics and powerful analytics that reduce your mean-time-to-resolution (MTTR). Infrastructure is specifically designed for complex environments that need flexible, dynamic server monitoring, from a physical datacenter to thousands of Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) instances and other types of integrations. Insights Insights was the name for the New Relic product that previously governed the reporting of custom events, and the ability to query and chart your New Relic data. These features are now a fundamental part of the New Relic One platform and are no longer governed by the Insights product or name. To learn more about these features: Event API for reporting custom events Query and chart data For historical reasons, the word \"Insights\" is still used in some places. Some examples of this: Some APM agents still have Insights language in their codebase. For example, the Java agent custom_insights_events configuration. For New Relic organizations on our original pricing plan, Insights Pro is still the product name governing custom event data ingest and retention. There is an API key called the Insights insert key. instance ID Each instance identified by New Relic is assigned a unique instance ID. Instance IDs are most commonly found for JVMs (Java Virtual Machines), but can exist for each agent. This ID is used to uniquely identify it, and to retrieve data about that instance via the REST API. For more information, see List instance IDs. instrumentation The collection of data from an application or host. When New Relic instruments a framework, it detects the methods and calls used by that framework, and intelligently groups them together. integration At New Relic, an integration refers to a solution that integrates with a specific technology (like a web framework or a type of database). See Integrations. interaction In our mobile monitoring, an interaction is a specific code path initiated by a user interaction (usually a button press). An interaction is the mobile equivalent of a transaction, and like a transaction an interaction can be traced and monitored. You can see much of the data included in an interaction in the BrowserInteraction event. interaction trace An interaction trace is a complete picture of a single interaction. With interaction traces, New Relic gives you much deeper visibility into a single slow interaction, which can help you understand a broader problem. Interaction traces are the mobile equivalent of a transaction trace. For more information, see Creating interactions (iOS) and Creating interactions (Android). inventory data Inventory data is information about the status or configuration of a service or host. Examples of inventory data include: Configuration settings Name of the host the service is on Amazon AWS region Port being used For more information, see Understand and use data. key transaction A web transaction that the user has marked as particularly important; for example, key business events (such as signups or purchase confirmations), or transactions with a high performance impact (such as searches). Key transactions have their own pages in the UI and other customized values. For more information, see Key transactions. launcher A launcher is a specific piece of code you can include when you create a New Relic One app. It creates the tile on the homepage that you click to launch the app. For more information, see the documentation about core UI components. log A log is a message about a system used to understand the activity of the system and to diagnose problems. For more information on how we use log data, see Log management. Log monitoring Our log management and monitoring features give you the tools to collect, process, explore, visualize, and alert on your log data using your existing log forwarder. With all of your log data in one place, you'll be able to make better decisions, detect and resolve problems more quickly, and see your logs in context to troubleshoot faster. Logs Our Logs feature is a scalable log management platform that allows you to connect your log data with the rest of your telemetry data. Pre-built plugins with some of the most common open-source logging tools make it simple to send your data from anywhere to New Relic. Logs in context Logs in context makes it easy to link to your log data with related data across the rest of our platform. Bringing all of this data together in a single tool allows you to quickly get to the root cause of an issue and find the log lines that you need to identify and resolve a problem. master account See parent account. metric A metric is a numeric measurement. Metric data is a broad category because there are several ways to make and report measurements. For more about how metrics are reported at New Relic, see New Relic data types. metric timeslice New Relic reports metrics in several ways. One variety of metric data is called metric timeslice data; this is the type of data used to generate many of the charts in APM, mobile monitoring, and browser monitoring (for more details, see metric timeslice data). Over time, metric timeslice data is aggregated into longer timeslice data records for more efficient storage. For more about how we aggregate this type of data, see Data aggregation. For how to query this type of data, see Query metric timeslice data. metric grouping issue A metric grouping issue occurs when an account sends too many differently named metric timeslice data points to New Relic, and those individual web transactions are not properly aggregated. For example, rather than a single /user/controlpanel/ metric name, you might see /user/controlpanel/alice, /user/controlpanel/bob, and /user/controlpanel/carol. For more information, see Metric grouping issues. minion The software that accepts monitor jobs from a private location. A minion is a packaged virtual appliance that runs in your hypervisor. For more information, see Private locations overview and install and configure private minions. Mobile monitoring Mobile monitoring allows you to monitor and manage the performance of your mobile apps on Android, iOS, tvOS, and other systems. Mobile monitoring provides end-to-end details, including crashes, throughput, HTTP requests, error traces, and more. Not to be confused with New Relic's own mobile apps for Android, iPhone, and iPad. monitor For our Synthetic Monitoring, a monitor ensures your website or API endpoint is available. For more information, see Adding and editing monitors. NerdGraph NerdGraph is our GraphQL API, an efficient and flexible query language that lets you request exactly the data you need, without over-fetching or under-fetching. NerdGraph calls get all the data you need in a single request. NerdGraph also makes it easier to evolve APIs over time and enables powerful developer tools. You can use our NerdGraph GraphiQL explorer to explore the schema and find definitions. With valid New Relic API key, you can try it out yourself at api.newrelic.com/graphiql. Nerdlet A Nerdlet is a component of a New Relic One application. It's a specific UI view, represented by a React JavaScript package. For more information, see Nerdpack file structure. Nerdpack A Nerdpack is a component of a New Relic One application. It's the package containing all the files needed by that application. For more information, see Nerdpack file structure. New Relic Edge with Infinite Tracing New Relic Edge with Infinite Tracing is a fully managed, distributed tracing service that observes 100% of your application traces, then provides actionable data so you can solve issues faster. For more information, see /docs/understand-dependencies/distributed-tracing/get-started/how-new-relic-distributed-tracing-works. New Relic One For more information, see Introduction to New Relic One. New Relic One catalog Our catalog is a collection of applications built on the New Relic One platform. The catalog includes custom apps we've built, public open source apps, and any apps that you buid. You can browse the catalog on New Relic One. NRQL (New Relic query language) NRQL is a query language, similar in form to SQL, that allows you to query the data stored in your New Relic account. non-web transaction APM identifies transactions as either web or non-web. When New Relic does not detect a transaction was initiated by a web request, this is called a non-web transaction. For more information, see Background processes and other non-web transactions. notification The message sent when an incident opens, is acknowledged, or closes. The type of notification is defined by the alert policy's notification channel. For an explanation of how notifications relate to other basic alerts concepts, see Concepts and workflow. notification channel Where we send a notification when an incident opens, is acknowledged, or closes. Available channels include email, mobile push notifications, webhooks, and more. on-host integration On-host integrations refer to integrations that reside on your own servers or hosts and that communicate with our infrastructure agent. For more information, see Introduction to on-host integrations. owner For accounts on our original pricing plan, this is a type of user role: the user who initially created the account. For more information, see Users. page load timing With page load timing, New Relic monitors the full load time for end-user browsers. New Relic's application agents dynamically inject JavaScript into the page, then capture the following key load points: Navigation start: The user initiates the transaction. First byte: The browser receives the requested page. DOM ready: The browser has finished parsing DOM. Page ready: Page loading is complete. Page load timing is sometimes referred to as RUM, or real user monitoring. Unlike standard RUM, page load timing also captures JavaScript errors and AJAX requests. For more information, see Page load timing process. parameter Deprecated term; see attribute. parent account New Relic organizations can have a parent/child account structure. This structure was much more important for organizations on our original user model, but is still used for some features for organizations on the New Relic One user model. Learn more about account structure. Parent accounts were previously referred to as \"master accounts\", and child accounts were previously referred to as \"sub-accounts\". permalink A unique URL that links to a view of your application at a specific point in time. Permalinks are useful for troubleshooting and for sharing interesting time windows with colleagues. pinger The component of New Relic that connects to your website to verify your website is accessible. New Relic has pingers in Europe, Asia, and the United States. Each pinger attempts to contact your website at least once every two minutes. If enough pingers are unable to reach your website, your application will be considered down. For in-depth scriptable testing, including real browser tests and tests of API endpoints, see Synthetic Monitoring. Synthetic Monitoring includes free ping monitoring, which allows you to monitor your website from locations around the world. For more information, see Types of Synthetic monitors. Plugins Plugins provides an open platform to monitor critical information about your entire stack. New Relic partners, PaAS and SaAS providers, third-party vendors, and plugin users can: Quickly install and use publicly available plugins in Plugin Central. Develop your own plugin agents to collect the metric data that matters most to your business. Publish your plugins for public or private access. polling interval (AWS) Our Amazon integrations query your AWS services according to a polling interval, which varies depending on the integration. Each polling interval occurs for every AWS entity. For example, if you have thirteen Elastic Load Balancers (ELB), each one will be polled every five minutes. Depending on the AWS integration, there may be delays in the timing between the API request and the metric data returned. If you notice unusual delays, follow the integration troubleshooting procedures. PPM (pages per minute) The number of pages per minute your application serves. private location A Synthetic monitor feature that allows you to run Synthetic monitors from within your own systems by creating private minions. Private locations allow you to extend your Synthetic coverage to new geographical locations, and to monitor websites behind your firewall such as an intranet site. For more information, see Private locations overview. recovery period A recovery period of time begins when a data source enters a non-violating state after being in a violating state. The recovery period is set in the condition's threshold. A violation will close when a source remains in a non-violating state and the recovery period time has elapsed. If the data source enters a violating state before the time has elapsed, the recovery period clock will reset and the violation won't close. response time The duration of time between a request for service and a response. For more information, see Response time. restricted user A type of user role on a New Relic account. For more information, see Users. rollup Using the same application name for multiple applications. This allows you to combine data in APM, either from multiple applications, or from multiple instances of an application. For more information, see Rolling up app data. root span For distributed tracing, the root span is the first span in a trace. In many cases, the root span duration will represent the duration of the entire trace, or be very close to it. However, for more complex, modern systems that use a lot of asynchronous, non-blocking processes, this will not be true. For those systems, the root span’s duration may be significantly less than the duration of the trace. RPM The term RPM usually refers to the number of requests per minute your application receives from users. This is usually the same as CPM (calls per minute). Historically, some New Relic monitoring solutions, like APM and Browser Monitoring, used to contain RPM in the URL; for example, https://rpm.newrelic.com. This language use originally referred to Rails performance management because the first iteration of our product monitored Ruby on Rails applications. We monitor many more languages and systems than Ruby now. RUM (real user monitoring) See page load timing. runbook A runbook contains standard procedures and operations typically used by system administrators, network operations staff, and other personnel to handle outages, alert incidents, and other situations. If your organization stores runbook instructions as URLs, you can link this information to an alerts policy so your personnel has easy access to this information when an incident violates the defined policy thresholds. SAML (Security Assertion Markup Language) SAML is an XML-based data format for sharing authentication data between two parties. New Relic accounts must obtain a SAML certificate in order to enable Single Sign On for their users. For more information, see SAML service providers. Selenium Selenium is an open-source browser testing suite. Synthetics uses Selenium to test monitored websites with real browsers. For more information, see monitor types. service A service is a cluster of runtime server processes that accomplish a particular task, usually service requests. Unlike an application, a service is not usually invoked by a human. New Relic offers a variety of integrations that allow you to report data from your services. signal The stream of telemetry data that's watched and alerted on. You use NRQL queries to define a signal. signal filter When we receive data and it's routed to the streaming alerts platform, your NRQL WHERE clause will filter the data coming in. The filtered streaming data is what's evaluated for loss of signal violations, for example. span In a distributed trace, a span is a \"named, timed operation representing a contiguous segment of work in that trace\" (from OpenTracing.io definition). For distributed tracing, spans are displayed in the distributed tracing UI, and the data type Span is available to be queried. See also root span. SSL certificate SSL certificates encrypt data that is being transmitted. While New Relic refers to security certificates as SSL because it is a more commonly used term, all certificates adhere to industry standards for secure encryption in transit. SSO (single sign on) SSO (single sign on) allows you to manage user authentication in New Relic using an external SSO provider. For more information, see Setting up SSO. streaming algorithm This is what determines when the data in an aggregation window is processed. The streaming algorithm uses your server's clock time and the aggregation window size to trigger the alert evaluation process. sub-accounts See master account. Synthetic monitoring Synthetic monitoring allows you to monitor your website or API endpoint via automated, scriptable tools. Use free ping monitor to ensure your website is accessible, or expand your monitoring with browser monitors, which test your website with real browsers. Go further with scripting, to script browsers or API monitors for sophisticated testing. target A target is a resource or component monitored by a New Relic monitoring tool that has been identified in an alert condition. When the data source for that target crosses the defined critical threshold, we will open a violation. Depending on your policy's Incident preference setting, Alerts may create an incident record and send notifications through the defined channels. See also entity. tag Tags are key:value metadata added to monitored apps, hosts, dashboards, and other entities to help you organize your data at a high level. For details, see Tags. Telemetry Data Platform The collection of features and tools you can use to ingest, visualize, and alert on all your telemetry data in one place. For more information, read the Introduction to the Telemetry Data Platform. thresholds Thresholds are alert condition settings that define a violation. Threshold values include the value a data source must pass to trigger a violation and the time-related settings that define a violation; for example: Passing a certain value for at least x minutes Passing a certain value only once in x minutes While the data source passes a certain value, a degradation period starts. Likewise, when that data source stops passing a certain value, a recovery period starts. The durations of these two time periods are defined in the alert condition threshold settings. Thresholds have a required critical (red) threshold and an optional warning (yellow) threshold. In the UI, the entity's health status indicator will change to yellow or red when a threshold has been crossed and a violation will open. For more information, see Define thresholds. For an explanation of how thresholds relate to other basic Alerts concepts, see Concepts and workflow. throughput Throughput is a measurement of user activity for a monitored application. APM throughput and Browser Monitoring throughput are measured in different ways: APM: requests per minute (RPM) Browser: page views per minute (PPM) tier A tier can refer to how New Relic categorizes or visualizes the various agent language ecosystems that we support. For example: In APM, the color-coded categories that appear on your app's main Overview chart show response time spent in various functions, processes, or agents as tiers; for example, request queuing, garbage collection, Middleware, JVMs, etc. In New Relic labels, TIER can be used to define or classify the client-server architecture; for example, front-end and back-end tiers. \"Tier\" may sometimes be used to refer to our Full Stack Observability pricing editions. time picker By default the New Relic UI shows data for the past 30 minutes, ending now. To change the time window, use the time picker. time range A time range can refer to a length of time selected in the New Relic UI. New Relic displays a time range depending on the range you select using the time picker. timeslice data See metric timeslice data. trace A trace is a description of how a request travels through a system. Trace data helps you understand the performance of your system and diagnose problems. For more information on how we use trace data, see New Relic data types. traffic light See health status. transaction A transaction is defined as one logical unit of work in an application. This term primarily refers to server-side transactions monitored by APM. For more information, see documentation about web transactions and non-web transactions. The term transaction is also sometimes used in Browser Monitoring. In that case, it primarily refers to activity beginning with a browser-side web request and ending with a complete page load. transaction trace A transaction trace is a complete picture of a single transaction, down to the database queries and exact invocation patterns. With transaction traces, New Relic gives you much deeper visibility into a single slow transaction, which can help you understand a broader problem. For more information, see Transaction traces. UI The New Relic user interface. For more information, see Standard page functions. user A user can refer to a specific user role in a New Relic account. For more information, see Users. UTC Universal Time Coordinated (UTC), or Coordinated Universal Time, is a standard timestamp for synchronizing time around the world. value function (metrics) The numeric value obtained from metric timeslice data; for example, an average, minimum, maximum, total, sample size, etc. violation A violation occurs when the entity monitored by an alert condition reports a value that crosses the thresholds defined in that condition. For an explanation of how violations relate to other basic alerts concepts, see Concepts and workflow. You can view a summary of the violations for a selected incident's page. You can also view the violations for a specific entity from the product's UI. web external Web external is the term applied to the portion of time spent in transactions to external applications from within the code of the application you are monitoring. That time can be a call to a third party company (a payment provider, for example) or it could be a call to another microservice within your own company. Web external demonstrates how performance is impacted by your code executing outside the application you are measuring. web transaction A transaction is defined as one logical unit of work in an application. This term primarily refers to server-side transactions monitored by APM. Web transactions are initiated with an HTTP request. For most organizations, these represent customer-centric interactions and thus are the most important transactions to monitor. For more information, see Web transactions and Non-web transactions. WebDriverJS WebDriver is a Selenium component, used to control Synthetics scripted browsers. Specifically, Synthetics uses WebDriverJS, a Node.js-based flavor of Selenium. For more information, see Writing scripted browsers and Scripted browser examples. workload A workload represents a group of entities that work together to provide a digital service. For more information, see Workloads.",

      "body": "You can tailor the Node.js agent to your app's requirements by editing your newrelic.js config file or by setting an environment variable. The config file resides in the root directory of your app. You can also configure a few options from New Relic, or use the Node.js agent API. Important The license_key setting is required. We highly recommend setting the app_name so that your app has a meaningful name instead of the default My Application. Configuration methods and precedence The primary method to configure the Node.js agent is the agent configuration file (newrelic.js). You can also configure most settings with environment variables. You can also adjust some settings with server-side configuration. The Node.js agent uses this order of precedence for configuration methods: Node.js configuration hierarchy: Server-side configuration settings override environment variables. Environment variables override the agent config file. The config file overrides the agent defaults. Here are detailed descriptions of each configuration method: Agent configuration file The config file (newrelic.js) contains every Node.js agent setting. When you install the Node.js agent, you must copy newrelic.js into your app's root directory. Most settings are empty by default; they inherit their values from config/default.js. Environment variables Most configuration settings in newrelic.js have equivalent environment variables. These are useful, for example, if your agent runs in a PaaS environment such as Heroku or Microsoft Azure. Node.js agent environment variables always start with NEW_RELIC_. Where available, these environment variables are documented below under individual config options as the Environ variable. There are also two rarely used settings that can only be configured via environment variables. Server-side configuration Owners and Admins can view and configure a few settings directly in New Relic. Where available, the UI labels for server-side config are listed in this document under individual config options as the Server-side label. Exports variables This section defines the Node.js agent variables in the order they typically appear in the exports.config = { section of your app's newrelic.js configuration file. app_name (REQUIRED) Type String Default \"My Application\" Environ variable NEW_RELIC_APP_NAME The name New Relic uses to identify your app. For example, app_name: ['MyNodeApp']. To use multiple names for your app, specify a comma-delimited list of names. Data for all applications with the same name will be merged in the New Relic UI, so set this carefully. We highly recommend that you replace the default name with a descriptive name to avoid confusion and unintended aggregation of data. Tip For Azure users, the Node.js agent will use APP_POOL_ID if it is set, so you can use the name you chose for your Azure Web Server without setting it twice. license_key (REQUIRED) Type String Default (none) Environ variable NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY This setting is required. Your New Relic license key. For example, license_key: '40HexadecimalCharacters'. agent_enabled Type Boolean Default true Environ variable NEW_RELIC_ENABLED Set to false to stop the agent from starting up. This is useful when debugging your code requires temporarily disabling the agent. It prevents the agent from bootstrapping its instrumentation or setting up all its pieces, which prevents the agent from starting up and connecting to New Relic's servers. allow_all_headers If true, enables capture of all HTTP headers, except for those filtered by exclude rules. If false, collected headers are limited to those defined in Node.js agent attributes. Type Boolean Default false Caution Any header-related include/exclude rules must be in camelCase form to be filtered. apdex_t (DEPRECATED) Type Number Default 0.100 Server-side label Apdex T Set your Apdex T via the New Relic UI. certificates Type Array of strings Default (none) Additional certificates to trust for SSL connections, specified as an array of strings in PEM format. This affects both connections to an HTTPS proxy and connections to New Relic. Tip You can also configure the agent to read its certificates from a file: certificates: [ fs.readFileSync('myca.crt', {encoding: 'utf8'}) ] Copy high_security Type Boolean Default false Environ variable NEW_RELIC_HIGH_SECURITY When set to true, enables high security v2. You must also enable the ssl setting and enable high security in the UI. host Type String Default collector.newrelic.com Environ variable NEW_RELIC_HOST Important Do not edit this value unless New Relic Support asks you to change it. Hostname for the New Relic collector to connect to the Internet; for example, host: 'collector.newrelic.com'. labels Adds tags. Specify your tags as objects or a semicolon-delimited string of colon-separated pairs (for example, Server:One;Data Center:Primary). Type Object or string Default (none) Environ variable NEW_RELIC_LABELS port Type Integer Default 443 Environ variable NEW_RELIC_PORT Important Do not edit this value unless New Relic Support asks you to change it. Port number to connect to the New Relic collector; for example, port: 443. proxy Type String Default (none) Environ variable NEW_RELIC_PROXY_URL A URL specifying the proxy server to connect to the Internet. For example, proxy: 'http://user:pass@10.0.0.1:8000/'. Important The proxy config file setting overrides the other config file proxy settings (proxy_host, proxy_port, proxy_user, proxy_pass) if used. Similarly, the NEW_RELIC_PROXY_URL environment variable overrides the other environment variable proxy settings (NEW_RELIC_PROXY_HOST, NEW_RELIC_PROXY_PORT, NEW_RELIC_PROXY_USER, and NEW_RELIC_PROXY_PASS) if used. proxy_host Type String Default (none) Environ variable NEW_RELIC_PROXY_HOST Hostname or IP address of the proxy server to connect to the Internet. proxy_pass Type String Default (none) Environ variable NEW_RELIC_PROXY_PASS Password for authenticating to the proxy server. The agent supports only basic HTTP authentication. proxy_port Type String Default (none) Environ variable NEW_RELIC_PROXY_PORT Port number of the proxy server to connect to the Internet. proxy_user Type String Default (none) Environ variable NEW_RELIC_PROXY_USER User name for authenticating to the proxy server. The agent supports only basic HTTP authentication. Logging variables This section defines the Node.js agent variables in the order they typically appear in the logging: { section of your app's newrelic.js configuration file. enabled Type String Default true (false in serverless_mode) Environ variable NEW_RELIC_LOG_ENABLED Enables or disables agent specific logging. level Type String Default info Environ variable NEW_RELIC_LOG_LEVEL Defines the level of detail recorded in the agent logs. From least detail to most detail, possible values are fatal, error, warn, info, debug, or trace. Caution Do not use debug or trace logging unless New Relic Support asks you to use them. These levels of logging can generate excessive overhead. For most situations, use info. filepath Type String Default process.cwd() plus newrelic_agent.log Environ variable NEW_RELIC_LOG Complete path to the New Relic agent log, including the filename. Defaults to filepath: require('path').join(process.cwd(), 'newrelic_agent.log'). The agent will shut down the process if it cannot create this file. The agent creates a log file with the same permissions as the parent Node.js agent process. To write all logging to stdout, set this to stdout. To write all logging to stderr, set this to stderr. Audit logging This section defines the Node.js agent variables in the order they typically appear in the audit_log: { section of your app's newrelic.js configuration file. enabled Type Boolean Default false Environ variable NEW_RELIC_AUDIT_LOG_ENABLED When enabled, the agent logs the payloads it sends to the collector. This data is included in the main log file even when logging level is set to the lowest level. endpoints Type Array Default Empty array (include all types) Environ variable NEW_RELIC_AUDIT_LOG_ENDPOINTS The agent sends several different types of data to the collector in separate payloads. By default, all of them are included in the log file. This option makes it possible to limit logging only to specific types of data. Valid values include: agent_settings analytic_event_data connect custom_event_data error_data error_event_data metric_data preconnect shutdown span_event_data sql_trace_data transaction_sample_data API configuration This section allows you to choose which API methods are enabled. Each configuration option allows you to modularly enable API methods that are responsible for sending custom information to New Relic. Important All of these are set to false when the agent is in high security mode. custom_attributes_enabled Type Boolean Default true Environ variable NEW_RELIC_API_CUSTOM_ATTRIBUTES This option enables newrelic.addCustomAttribute and newrelic.addCustomAttributes. custom_events_enabled Type Boolean Default true Environ variable NEW_RELIC_API_CUSTOM_EVENTS This option enables recordCustomEvent. notice_error_enabled Type Boolean Default true Environ variable NEW_RELIC_API_NOTICE_ERROR This option enables newrelic.noticeError. Attributes This section defines the variables for Node.js agent attributes in the order they typically appear in the attributes: { section of your app's newrelic.js configuration file. Caution Any header-related include/exclude rules must be in camelCase form to be filtered. enabled Type Boolean Default true Environ variable NEW_RELIC_ATTRIBUTES_ENABLED If true, enables capture of attributes for all destinations. exclude Type Array Default [] Environ variable NEW_RELIC_ATTRIBUTES_EXCLUDE Prefix of attributes to exclude from all destinations. Allows * as wildcard at end. include Type Array Default [] Environ variable NEW_RELIC_ATTRIBUTES_INCLUDE Prefix of attributes to include from all destinations. Allows * as wildcard at end. include_enabled Type Boolean Default true Environ variable NEW_RELIC_ATTRIBUTES_INCLUDE_ENABLED When true, patterns may be added to the attributes.include list. Error collector variables You can manage how error are handled in New Relic. This section defines the Node.js agent variables in the order they typically appear in the error_collector: { section of your app's newrelic.js configuration file. enabled Type Boolean Default true Environ variable NEW_RELIC_ERROR_COLLECTOR_ENABLED Server-side label Enable error collection? When enabled, the agent collects error traces from your app. ignore_status_codes Type Array Default 404 Environ variable NEW_RELIC_ERROR_COLLECTOR_IGNORE_ERROR_CODES Server-side label Ignore these status codes Comma-delimited list of HTTP status codes for the error collector to ignore. Caution Errors recorded using newrelic.noticeError do not obey this configuration value. ignore_classes Type Array|Object Default [] Environ variable NEW_RELIC_ERROR_COLLECTOR_IGNORE_ERRORS Comma-delimited list of javascript error types/classes for the error collector to ignore. The following configuration /* ... */ error_collector: { ignore_classes: [\"ReferenceError\"] } /* ... */ Copy Would ignore all reference errors. Caution Errors recorded using newrelic.noticeError do not obey this configuration value. ignore_messages Type Object Default {} A javascript object describing a list of javascript classes tied to javascript error messages for the collector to ignore. The following configuration. /* ... */ error_collector: { /* ... */ ignore_messages: {\"Error\":[\"Undefined\", \"Out of time\"]} /* ... */ } /* ... */ Copy Would ignore all errors of type Error, with the exact (case-sensitive) message strings of Undefined and Out of time. Caution Errors recorded using newrelic.noticeError do not obey this configuration value. expected_status_codes Type Array Default [] Environ variable NEW_RELIC_ERROR_COLLECTOR_EXPECTED_ERROR_CODES Comma-delimited list of HTTP status codes for the error collector to mark as expected. Caution Errors recorded using newrelic.noticeError do not obey this configuration value. expected_classes Type Array Default [] Environ variable NEW_RELIC_ERROR_COLLECTOR_EXPECTED_ERRORS The following configuration /* ... */ error_collector: { expected_classes: [\"ReferenceError\"] } /* ... */ Copy Would mark all reference errors as expected. Caution Errors recorded using newrelic.noticeError do not obey this configuration value. expected_messages Type Object Default {} A javascript object describing a list of javascript classes tied to javascript error messages for the collector to ignore. The following configuration. /* ... */ error_collector: { /* ... */ expected_messages: {\"Error\":[\"Undefined\", \"Out of time\"]} /* ... */ } /* ... */ Copy Would mark all errors of type Error, with the exact (case-sensitive) message strings of Undefined and Out of time. Caution Errors recorded using newrelic.noticeError do not obey this configuration value. attributes.enabled Type Boolean Default true Environ variable NEW_RELIC_ERROR_COLLECTOR_ATTRIBUTES_ENABLED If true, the agent captures attributes from error collection. Caution Any header-related include/exclude rules must be in camelCase form to be filtered. attributes.exclude Type Array Default [] Environ variable NEW_RELIC_ERROR_COLLECTOR_ATTRIBUTES_EXCLUDE Prefix of attributes to exclude from error collection. Allows * as wildcard at end. attributes.include Type Array Default [] Environ variable NEW_RELIC_ERROR_COLLECTOR_ATTRIBUTES_INCLUDE Prefix of attributes to include in error collection. Allows * as wildcard at end. max_event_samples_stored Type Integer Default 100 Environ variable NEW_RELIC_ERROR_COLLECTOR_MAX_EVENT_SAMPLES_STORED Defines the maximum number of events the agent collects per minute. If there are more than this number, the agent collects a statistical sampling. Transaction tracer variables The agent groups your requests into transactions, which are used to: Visualize where your app spends its time (in transaction breakdowns). Identify slow requests. Group metrics. Isolate other issues, such as slow database performance. This section defines the Node.js agent variables in the order they typically appear in the transaction_tracer: { section of your app's newrelic.js configuration file. Important Do not use brackets [suffix] at the end of your transaction name. New Relic automatically strips brackets from the name. Instead, use parentheses (suffix) or other symbols if needed. enabled Type Boolean Default true Environ variable NEW_RELIC_TRACER_ENABLED Server-side label Enable transaction tracing? When enabled, the agent collects slow transaction traces. explain_threshold Type Integer Default 500 Environ variable NEW_RELIC_EXPLAIN_THRESHOLD Minimum query duration (in milliseconds) for a transaction to be eligible for slow queries in transaction traces. record_sql Type String (off, obfuscated, or raw) Default off Environ variable NEW_RELIC_RECORD_SQL This option affects both slow queries and record_sql for transaction traces. It can have one of three values: off, obfuscated, or raw. When set to off no slow queries will be captured, and backtraces and SQL will not be included in transaction traces. If set to raw or obfuscated, the agent sends raw or obfuscated SQL and a slow query sample to the collector. The agent may also send SQL when other criteria are met, such as when slow_sql.enabled is set. top_n Type Integer Default 20 Environ variable NEW_RELIC_TRACER_TOP_N Defines the maximum number of requests eligible for transaction traces. Transactions are named based on the request, and top_n refers to the \"top n slowest transactions\" grouped by these names. The module replaces a recorded trace with a new trace only if the new trace is slower than the previous slowest trace of that name. The default value for this setting is top_n: 20, because the Transactions page also defaults to the 20 slowest transactions. The Node.js agent captures at least five different slow transactions in the first harvest cycle after start up. It will also reset and capture different transactions if no slow transactions have been captured for the last five harvest cycles. This allows you to see more information about more of your app's request paths, at the possible cost of not focusing on the absolutely slowest request for that harvest cycle. Tip To record the absolute slowest transaction over the last minute, you can set top_n: 0 or top_n: 1. However, this causes one very slow route to dominate your transaction traces. transaction_threshold Type Integer or apdex_f Default apdex_f Environ variable NEW_RELIC_TRACER_THRESHOLD Server-side label Threshold Threshold of web transaction response time in seconds beyond which a transaction is eligible for transaction tracing. The default value is apdex_f; this sets the trace threshold to four times your application's Apdex T. You can also enter a specific time value in milliseconds. Example: Threshold set to apdex_f The default apdex_t is 100 milliseconds. If your transaction threshold is set to apdex_f, a \"slow\" transaction is 400 milliseconds. hide_internals Type boolean Default true Environ variable NEW_RELIC_HIDE_INTERNALS The agent uses a small amount of CPU in order to hide internal properties that are attached to the web application. If you change this configuration to false, it may slightly decrease your agent overhead, but it could also have an impact on the performance of the agent. attributes.enabled Type Boolean Default true Environ variable NEW_RELIC_TRANSACTION_TRACER_ATTRIBUTES_ENABLED If true, the agent captures attributes from transaction traces. Caution Any header-related include/exclude rules must be in camelCase form to be filtered. attributes.exclude Type Array Default [] Environ variable NEW_RELIC_TRANSACTION_TRACER_ATTRIBUTES_EXCLUDE Prefix of attributes to exclude from transaction traces. Allows * as wildcard at end. attributes.include Type Array Default [] Environ variable NEW_RELIC_TRANSACTION_TRACER_ATTRIBUTES_INCLUDE Prefix of attributes to include in transaction traces. Allows * as wildcard at end. Rules variables This section defines the Node.js agent variables in the order they typically appear in the rules: { section of your app's newrelic.js configuration file. name Type Strings or regular expressions Default (none) Environ variable NEW_RELIC_NAMING_RULES A comma-delimited list of rules to match incoming request URLs and name the associated New Relic transaction. Uses the format: name: [ {pattern: 'STRING_OR_REGEX', name: 'NAME'}, {pattern: 'STRING_OR_REGEX', name: 'NAME'} ], Copy Both parameters are required. For strings, you must escape control characters. You do not need to escape control characters in regular expressions. Additional attributes are ignored. Regular expressions support JavaScript-style capture groups, and names use $1-style replacement strings. Regular expressions only find the first matching result; subsequent matches are ignored. For more information, see Node.js transaction naming API. For the NEW_RELIC_NAMING_RULES environment variable, pass the rules as comma-delimited JSON object literals: NEW_RELIC_NAMING_RULES='{\"pattern\":\"^t\",\"name\":\"u\"},{\"pattern\":\"^u\",\"name\":\"t\"}' Copy ignore Type Strings or regular expressions Default Regular expression to match socket.io long-polling requests (\"^ \\ /socket \\ .io \\ /. * \\ /xhr-polling/\"). Environ variable NEW_RELIC_IGNORING_RULES Define a list of request URLs you want the agent to ignore. Specify the list as patterns, which can be strings or regular expressions. enforce_backstop Type Boolean Default true Environ variable NEW_RELIC_ENFORCE_BACKSTOP Caution Do not change this setting unless you understand metric grouping issues. When enabled, the agent renames transactions that are not affected by other naming logic (such as the API, rules, or metric normalization rules) to NormalizedUri/*. If you set this to false, the agent sets transaction names to Uri/path/to/resource. Transaction events variables This section defines the Node.js agent variables in the order they typically appear in the transaction_events: { section of your app's newrelic.js configuration file. enabled Type Boolean Default true When enabled, the agent sends transaction events to New Relic. This event data includes transaction timing, transaction name, and any custom parameters. If this is disabled, the agent does not collect this data or send it to New Relic. max_samples_stored Type Integer Default 10000 Environ variable NEW_RELIC_TRANSACTION_EVENTS_MAX_SAMPLES_STORED Defines the maximum number of events the agent collects per minute. If there are more than this number, the agent collects a statistical sampling. We do not recommend configuring past 10,000. The server will cap data at 10,000 per-minute. Important This configuration had different behavior in agent versions lower than 6.0.0. See max_samples_stored (DEPRECATED) for agent versions 5.x or lower. max_samples_stored (DEPRECATED) Type Integer Default 20000 Defines the maximum number of events the agent stores if it is unable to communicate with the New Relic collector. The values from the previous harvest cycle will be merged into the next one, with this option limiting the maximum number. Make sure this number is greater than max_samples_per_minute; for example, set it to twice as much. Consider your memory overhead before increasing this value. Caution This configuration has different behavior starting with agent version 6.0.0 and a new recommended maximum. See max_samples_stored for agent versions 6.x or higher. max_samples_per_minute (DEPRECATED) Type Integer Default 10000 Defines the maximum number of events the agent collects per minute. If there are more than this number, the agent collects a statistical sampling. Caution This configuration has been replaced with max_samples_stored starting with version 6.0.0 of the agent. See max_samples_stored for 6.x or later agents. attributes.enabled Type Boolean Default true Environ variable NEW_RELIC_TRANSACTION_EVENTS_ATTRIBUTES_ENABLED If true, the agent captures attributes from transaction events. Caution Any header-related include/exclude rules must be in camelCase form to be filtered. attributes.exclude Type Array Default [] Environ variable NEW_RELIC_TRANSACTION_EVENTS_ATTRIBUTES_EXCLUDE Prefix of attributes to exclude from transaction events. Allows * as wildcard at end. attributes.include Type Array Default [] Environ variable NEW_RELIC_TRANSACTION_EVENTS_ATTRIBUTES_INCLUDE Prefix of attributes to include in transaction events. Allows * as wildcard at end. Browser monitoring variables This section defines the Node.js agent variables in the order they typically appear in the browser_monitoring: { section of your app's newrelic.js configuration file. enable Type Boolean Default true Environ variable NEW_RELIC_BROWSER_MONITOR_ENABLE Server-side label Enable browser monitoring? Generate JavaScript headers for browser instrumentation. Although this defaults to true, the agent doesn't inject the browser JS code unless you have enabled browser monitoring. Even if you have enabled it and added the browser timing header, you can disable browser monitoring for your app by setting this to false. debug Type Boolean Default false Environ variable NEW_RELIC_BROWSER_MONITOR_DEBUG If true, request un-minified sources from the server. attributes.enabled Type Boolean Default false Environ variable NEW_RELIC_BROWSER_MONITORING_ATTRIBUTES_ENABLED If true, the agent sends custom attributes to browser monitoring. Caution Any header-related include/exclude rules must be in camelCase form to be filtered. attributes.exclude Type Array Default [] Environ variable NEW_RELIC_BROWSER_MONITORING_ATTRIBUTES_EXCLUDE Prefix of attributes to exclude from browser monitoring. Allows * as wildcard at end. attributes.include Type Array Default [] Environ variable NEW_RELIC_BROWSER_MONITORING_ATTRIBUTES_INCLUDE Prefix of attributes to include in browser monitoring. Allows * as wildcard at end. Custom events variables This section defines the Node.js agent variables in the order they typically appear in the custom_insights_events: { section of your app's newrelic.js configuration file. Currently there are no environment variables for custom events. enabled Type Boolean Default true When enabled, the agent sends custom events recorded with recordCustomEvent() to New Relic. If this is disabled, the agent does not collect this data or send it to New Relic. max_samples_stored Type Integer Default 1000 Environ variable NEW_RELIC_CUSTOM_INSIGHTS_EVENTS_MAX_SAMPLES_STORED Defines the maximum number of custom events the agent collects per minute. If the number of custom events exceeds this limit, the agent collects a statistical sampling. Important Increasing this limit increases memory usage. Slow queries variables This section defines the Node.js agent variables in the order they typically appear in the slow_sql: { section of your app's newrelic.js configuration file. These options control behavior for slow queries, but do not affect SQL nodes in transaction traces. enabled Type Boolean Default false Environ variable NEW_RELIC_SLOW_SQL_ENABLED When enabled, the agent collects slow query details. max_samples Type Integer Default 10 Environ variable NEW_RELIC_MAX_SQL_SAMPLES Defines the maximum number of slow queries the agent collects per minute. The agent discards additional queries after the limit is reached. Important Increasing this limit increases memory usage. Custom hostname variables This section defines the Node.js agent variables in the order they typically appear in the process_host: { section of your app's newrelic.js configuration file. These options control behavior regarding the host display name in the APM UI. display_name Type String of 255 bytes or less Default (none) Environ variable NEW_RELIC_PROCESS_HOST_DISPLAY_NAME Specify a custom hostname for display in New Relic. If you do not set this field, New Relic will continue to use the default hostname found by calling os.hostname(). If you use the default hostname settings, New Relic finds the hostname through os.hostname(). If this call fails, New Relic uses the host's IP as the name. If you set ipv_preference: 4 or ipv_preference: 6, you can select the type of IP address (IPv4 or IPv6) that appears in the New Relic UI. ipv_preference Type Integer (4 or 6) Default 4 Environ variable NEW_RELIC_IPV_PREFERENCE Environment variable overrides This section defines two configuration options only available with environment variables. These overrides are not used in most configurations. NEW_RELIC_HOME Path to the directory containing newrelic.js. This is available only as an environment variable. You cannot set it in your config file. Type String Default (none) NEW_RELIC_NO_CONFIG_FILE If used, this prevents the agent from reading configuration settings from newrelic.js. Default values and values from environment variables will still be set. This is available only as an environment variable. You cannot set it in your config file. Type Boolean Default False Datastore tracer variables This section defines the Node.js agent variables in the order they typically appear in the datastore_tracer section of your app's newrelic.js configuration file. These options control behavior for collecting datastore instance metrics. instance_reporting.enabled Type Boolean Default true When enabled, the agent collects datastore instance metrics (such as host and port) for some database drivers. These are reported on slow query traces and transaction traces. database_name_reporting.enabled Type Boolean Default true When enabled, the agent collects database name on slow query traces and transaction traces for some database drivers. Cross application tracing (DEPRECATED) The Node.js agent variables that control cross application tracing typically appear in the cross_application_tracer section of your app's newrelic.js configuration file: enabled Type Boolean Default false When set to true, allows tracing of transactions across more than one New Relic-monitored applications. Important Cross application tracing (CAT) has been deprecated and will be removed in a future major release. For cross-service visibility, we recommend using distributed tracing, which is enabled by default as of agent version 8.3.0. Before enabling, read the transition guide. Error message redaction variables The Node.js agent variables that control error message redaction appear in the allow_raw_exception_messages section of your app's newrelic.js configuration file: enabled Type Boolean Default true Environ variable NEW_RELIC_ALLOW_RAW_EXCEPTION_MESSAGES_ENABLED When false, the agent will redact the messages of captured errors. Distributed tracing Important Enabling distributed tracing disables cross application tracing, and has effects on other APM features. Before enabling, read the transition guide. Requires Node.js agent version 4.7.0 or higher. Distributed tracing lets you see the path that a request takes as it travels through a distributed system. When configuring via the config file, place the following option in the distributed_tracing section. enabled Type Boolean Default true Environ variable NEW_RELIC_DISTRIBUTED_TRACING_ENABLED Set this to true to enable distributed tracing. For example, to enable this in the config file, you would use: distributed_tracing: { enabled: true } Copy exclude_newrelic_header Type Boolean Default false Set this to true to exclude the New Relic header that is attached to outbound requests, and instead only rely on W3C Trace Context Headers for distributed tracing. If this is false then both types of headers are used. For example, to enable this in the config file, you would use: distributed_tracing:{ enabled: true, exclude_newrelic_header: true } Copy Span events Span data is reported for distributed tracing. Distributed tracing must be enabled to report spans. Span configuration is set in the span_events stanza. Options include: enabled Type Boolean Default true Environ variable NEW_RELIC_SPAN_EVENTS_ENABLED Turns reporting of span events on or off. attributes.enabled Type Boolean Default true Environ variable NEW_RELIC_SPAN_EVENTS_ATTRIBUTES_ENABLED This setting can be used to turn reporting of attributes on or off for spans. If attributes.enabled at the root level is false, no attributes will be sent with spans regardless on how this is set. attributes.include Type Array Default [] Environ variable NEW_RELIC_SPAN_EVENTS_ATTRIBUTES_INCLUDE If attributes are enabled for spans, all attribute keys found in this list will be attached to spans. For more information, see the agent attribute rules. attributes.exclude Type Array Default [] Environ variable NEW_RELIC_SPAN_EVENTS_ATTRIBUTES_EXCLUDE All attribute keys found in this list will not be sent with spans. For more information, see the agent attribute rules. max_samples_stored Type Integer Default 2000 Environ variable NEW_RELIC_SPAN_EVENTS_MAX_SAMPLES_STORED Defines the maximum number of events the agent collects per minute. If there are more than this number, the agent collects a statistical sampling. We do not recommend configuring past 10k. The server will cap data at 10k per-minute. Infinite Tracing To turn on Infinite Tracing, enable distributed tracing (set distributed_tracing to enabled: true) and add the additional settings below. For an example, see Language agents: configure distributed tracing. trace_observer.host Type String Default (none) Environ variable NEW_RELIC_INFINITE_TRACING_TRACE_OBSERVER_HOST For help getting a valid Infinite Tracing trace observer host entry, see Find or create a trace observer endpoint.",

      "body": "Follow the appropriate procedure to rename your browser app depending on the deployment option you used to add it to browser. Rename app monitored by APM If you added an app to browser already being monitored by APM, the app name that appears in browser is the same as the app name in the APM UI. To rename the app, use any of these options: Option Comments Rename and continue collecting data This option is useful when you simply want to give an app a different display name (alias). To change the alias that appears in the New Relic UI, use the app's Settings page: Go to one.newrelic.com > APM > (select an app) > Settings > Application. Stop reporting under the old name To stop reporting data under the old name and begin collecting data with a new name (app identifer), use the APM agent's configuration file. This changes the identifier that New Relic's data collector uses to distinguish one app from another. Based on the data retention schedule, New Relic will retain historical data collected under the old name, and will collect and aggregate data under the new name. If one or more apps share the same name, then their data will be aggregated in the UI. Caution If you change the app identifier, a new application will appear in our user interface with the new name, and data will stop reporting to the app(s) with the old name. Rename app via JavaScript snippet This information applies if you inserted the browser agent's JavaScript snippet into your: App monitored by APM that was deployed via the copy/paste method Single page app (SPA) Any standalone browser app that is not also monitored by APM You cannot directly edit the JavaScript snippet in the existing app. Instead, to use your app with a different name: Follow standard procedures to create a new app using the copy/paste method. Provide the new name, and generate the JavaScript snippet. Copy the new JavaScript snippet. In your webpage, replace the JavaScript from your original app with the JavaScript generated for the new app name. If your standalone app has multiple names, copy the custom app IDs in your configuration script to your new app. Based on the data retention schedule, New Relic will retain historical data collected under the old name, and will collect and aggregate data under the new name. Rename app via New Relic REST API (v2) This information applies only to browser apps that are also monitored by APM. You cannot change the app name via the REST API if you used the copy/paste method to insert browser's JavaScript snippet into your app. Follow standard procedures to change the APM app alias via REST API or API Explorer. New Relic automatically changes the display name for the app everywhere in the New Relic UI, including browser.",

      "body": "You can tailor the Node.js agent to your app's requirements by editing your newrelic.js config file or by setting an environment variable. The config file resides in the root directory of your app. You can also configure a few options from New Relic, or use the Node.js agent API. Important The license_key setting is required. We highly recommend setting the app_name so that your app has a meaningful name instead of the default My Application. Configuration methods and precedence The primary method to configure the Node.js agent is the agent configuration file (newrelic.js). You can also configure most settings with environment variables. You can also adjust some settings with server-side configuration. The Node.js agent uses this order of precedence for configuration methods: Node.js configuration hierarchy: Server-side configuration settings override environment variables. Environment variables override the agent config file. The config file overrides the agent defaults. Here are detailed descriptions of each configuration method: Agent configuration file The config file (newrelic.js) contains every Node.js agent setting. When you install the Node.js agent, you must copy newrelic.js into your app's root directory. Most settings are empty by default; they inherit their values from config/default.js. Environment variables Most configuration settings in newrelic.js have equivalent environment variables. These are useful, for example, if your agent runs in a PaaS environment such as Heroku or Microsoft Azure. Node.js agent environment variables always start with NEW_RELIC_. Where available, these environment variables are documented below under individual config options as the Environ variable. There are also two rarely used settings that can only be configured via environment variables. Server-side configuration Owners and Admins can view and configure a few settings directly in New Relic. Where available, the UI labels for server-side config are listed in this document under individual config options as the Server-side label. Exports variables This section defines the Node.js agent variables in the order they typically appear in the exports.config = { section of your app's newrelic.js configuration file. app_name (REQUIRED) Type String Default \"My Application\" Environ variable NEW_RELIC_APP_NAME The name New Relic uses to identify your app. For example, app_name: ['MyNodeApp']. To use multiple names for your app, specify a comma-delimited list of names. Data for all applications with the same name will be merged in the New Relic UI, so set this carefully. We highly recommend that you replace the default name with a descriptive name to avoid confusion and unintended aggregation of data. Tip For Azure users, the Node.js agent will use APP_POOL_ID if it is set, so you can use the name you chose for your Azure Web Server without setting it twice. license_key (REQUIRED) Type String Default (none) Environ variable NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY This setting is required. Your New Relic license key. For example, license_key: '40HexadecimalCharacters'. agent_enabled Type Boolean Default true Environ variable NEW_RELIC_ENABLED Set to false to stop the agent from starting up. This is useful when debugging your code requires temporarily disabling the agent. It prevents the agent from bootstrapping its instrumentation or setting up all its pieces, which prevents the agent from starting up and connecting to New Relic's servers. allow_all_headers If true, enables capture of all HTTP headers, except for those filtered by exclude rules. If false, collected headers are limited to those defined in Node.js agent attributes. Type Boolean Default false Caution Any header-related include/exclude rules must be in camelCase form to be filtered. apdex_t (DEPRECATED) Type Number Default 0.100 Server-side label Apdex T Set your Apdex T via the New Relic UI. certificates Type Array of strings Default (none) Additional certificates to trust for SSL connections, specified as an array of strings in PEM format. This affects both connections to an HTTPS proxy and connections to New Relic. Tip You can also configure the agent to read its certificates from a file: certificates: [ fs.readFileSync('myca.crt', {encoding: 'utf8'}) ] Copy high_security Type Boolean Default false Environ variable NEW_RELIC_HIGH_SECURITY When set to true, enables high security v2. You must also enable the ssl setting and enable high security in the UI. host Type String Default collector.newrelic.com Environ variable NEW_RELIC_HOST Important Do not edit this value unless New Relic Support asks you to change it. Hostname for the New Relic collector to connect to the Internet; for example, host: 'collector.newrelic.com'. labels Adds tags. Specify your tags as objects or a semicolon-delimited string of colon-separated pairs (for example, Server:One;Data Center:Primary). Type Object or string Default (none) Environ variable NEW_RELIC_LABELS port Type Integer Default 443 Environ variable NEW_RELIC_PORT Important Do not edit this value unless New Relic Support asks you to change it. Port number to connect to the New Relic collector; for example, port: 443. proxy Type String Default (none) Environ variable NEW_RELIC_PROXY_URL A URL specifying the proxy server to connect to the Internet. For example, proxy: 'http://user:pass@10.0.0.1:8000/'. Important The proxy config file setting overrides the other config file proxy settings (proxy_host, proxy_port, proxy_user, proxy_pass) if used. Similarly, the NEW_RELIC_PROXY_URL environment variable overrides the other environment variable proxy settings (NEW_RELIC_PROXY_HOST, NEW_RELIC_PROXY_PORT, NEW_RELIC_PROXY_USER, and NEW_RELIC_PROXY_PASS) if used. proxy_host Type String Default (none) Environ variable NEW_RELIC_PROXY_HOST Hostname or IP address of the proxy server to connect to the Internet. proxy_pass Type String Default (none) Environ variable NEW_RELIC_PROXY_PASS Password for authenticating to the proxy server. The agent supports only basic HTTP authentication. proxy_port Type String Default (none) Environ variable NEW_RELIC_PROXY_PORT Port number of the proxy server to connect to the Internet. proxy_user Type String Default (none) Environ variable NEW_RELIC_PROXY_USER User name for authenticating to the proxy server. The agent supports only basic HTTP authentication. Logging variables This section defines the Node.js agent variables in the order they typically appear in the logging: { section of your app's newrelic.js configuration file. enabled Type String Default true (false in serverless_mode) Environ variable NEW_RELIC_LOG_ENABLED Enables or disables agent specific logging. level Type String Default info Environ variable NEW_RELIC_LOG_LEVEL Defines the level of detail recorded in the agent logs. From least detail to most detail, possible values are fatal, error, warn, info, debug, or trace. Caution Do not use debug or trace logging unless New Relic Support asks you to use them. These levels of logging can generate excessive overhead. For most situations, use info. filepath Type String Default process.cwd() plus newrelic_agent.log Environ variable NEW_RELIC_LOG Complete path to the New Relic agent log, including the filename. Defaults to filepath: require('path').join(process.cwd(), 'newrelic_agent.log'). The agent will shut down the process if it cannot create this file. The agent creates a log file with the same permissions as the parent Node.js agent process. To write all logging to stdout, set this to stdout. To write all logging to stderr, set this to stderr. Audit logging This section defines the Node.js agent variables in the order they typically appear in the audit_log: { section of your app's newrelic.js configuration file. enabled Type Boolean Default false Environ variable NEW_RELIC_AUDIT_LOG_ENABLED When enabled, the agent logs the payloads it sends to the collector. This data is included in the main log file even when logging level is set to the lowest level. endpoints Type Array Default Empty array (include all types) Environ variable NEW_RELIC_AUDIT_LOG_ENDPOINTS The agent sends several different types of data to the collector in separate payloads. By default, all of them are included in the log file. This option makes it possible to limit logging only to specific types of data. Valid values include: agent_settings analytic_event_data connect custom_event_data error_data error_event_data metric_data preconnect shutdown span_event_data sql_trace_data transaction_sample_data API configuration This section allows you to choose which API methods are enabled. Each configuration option allows you to modularly enable API methods that are responsible for sending custom information to New Relic. Important All of these are set to false when the agent is in high security mode. custom_attributes_enabled Type Boolean Default true Environ variable NEW_RELIC_API_CUSTOM_ATTRIBUTES This option enables newrelic.addCustomAttribute and newrelic.addCustomAttributes. custom_events_enabled Type Boolean Default true Environ variable NEW_RELIC_API_CUSTOM_EVENTS This option enables recordCustomEvent. notice_error_enabled Type Boolean Default true Environ variable NEW_RELIC_API_NOTICE_ERROR This option enables newrelic.noticeError. Attributes This section defines the variables for Node.js agent attributes in the order they typically appear in the attributes: { section of your app's newrelic.js configuration file. Caution Any header-related include/exclude rules must be in camelCase form to be filtered. enabled Type Boolean Default true Environ variable NEW_RELIC_ATTRIBUTES_ENABLED If true, enables capture of attributes for all destinations. exclude Type Array Default [] Environ variable NEW_RELIC_ATTRIBUTES_EXCLUDE Prefix of attributes to exclude from all destinations. Allows * as wildcard at end. include Type Array Default [] Environ variable NEW_RELIC_ATTRIBUTES_INCLUDE Prefix of attributes to include from all destinations. Allows * as wildcard at end. include_enabled Type Boolean Default true Environ variable NEW_RELIC_ATTRIBUTES_INCLUDE_ENABLED When true, patterns may be added to the attributes.include list. Error collector variables You can manage how error are handled in New Relic. This section defines the Node.js agent variables in the order they typically appear in the error_collector: { section of your app's newrelic.js configuration file. enabled Type Boolean Default true Environ variable NEW_RELIC_ERROR_COLLECTOR_ENABLED Server-side label Enable error collection? When enabled, the agent collects error traces from your app. ignore_status_codes Type Array Default 404 Environ variable NEW_RELIC_ERROR_COLLECTOR_IGNORE_ERROR_CODES Server-side label Ignore these status codes Comma-delimited list of HTTP status codes for the error collector to ignore. Caution Errors recorded using newrelic.noticeError do not obey this configuration value. ignore_classes Type Array|Object Default [] Environ variable NEW_RELIC_ERROR_COLLECTOR_IGNORE_ERRORS Comma-delimited list of javascript error types/classes for the error collector to ignore. The following configuration /* ... */ error_collector: { ignore_classes: [\"ReferenceError\"] } /* ... */ Copy Would ignore all reference errors. Caution Errors recorded using newrelic.noticeError do not obey this configuration value. ignore_messages Type Object Default {} A javascript object describing a list of javascript classes tied to javascript error messages for the collector to ignore. The following configuration. /* ... */ error_collector: { /* ... */ ignore_messages: {\"Error\":[\"Undefined\", \"Out of time\"]} /* ... */ } /* ... */ Copy Would ignore all errors of type Error, with the exact (case-sensitive) message strings of Undefined and Out of time. Caution Errors recorded using newrelic.noticeError do not obey this configuration value. expected_status_codes Type Array Default [] Environ variable NEW_RELIC_ERROR_COLLECTOR_EXPECTED_ERROR_CODES Comma-delimited list of HTTP status codes for the error collector to mark as expected. Caution Errors recorded using newrelic.noticeError do not obey this configuration value. expected_classes Type Array Default [] Environ variable NEW_RELIC_ERROR_COLLECTOR_EXPECTED_ERRORS The following configuration /* ... */ error_collector: { expected_classes: [\"ReferenceError\"] } /* ... */ Copy Would mark all reference errors as expected. Caution Errors recorded using newrelic.noticeError do not obey this configuration value. expected_messages Type Object Default {} A javascript object describing a list of javascript classes tied to javascript error messages for the collector to ignore. The following configuration. /* ... */ error_collector: { /* ... */ expected_messages: {\"Error\":[\"Undefined\", \"Out of time\"]} /* ... */ } /* ... */ Copy Would mark all errors of type Error, with the exact (case-sensitive) message strings of Undefined and Out of time. Caution Errors recorded using newrelic.noticeError do not obey this configuration value. attributes.enabled Type Boolean Default true Environ variable NEW_RELIC_ERROR_COLLECTOR_ATTRIBUTES_ENABLED If true, the agent captures attributes from error collection. Caution Any header-related include/exclude rules must be in camelCase form to be filtered. attributes.exclude Type Array Default [] Environ variable NEW_RELIC_ERROR_COLLECTOR_ATTRIBUTES_EXCLUDE Prefix of attributes to exclude from error collection. Allows * as wildcard at end. attributes.include Type Array Default [] Environ variable NEW_RELIC_ERROR_COLLECTOR_ATTRIBUTES_INCLUDE Prefix of attributes to include in error collection. Allows * as wildcard at end. max_event_samples_stored Type Integer Default 100 Environ variable NEW_RELIC_ERROR_COLLECTOR_MAX_EVENT_SAMPLES_STORED Defines the maximum number of events the agent collects per minute. If there are more than this number, the agent collects a statistical sampling. Transaction tracer variables The agent groups your requests into transactions, which are used to: Visualize where your app spends its time (in transaction breakdowns). Identify slow requests. Group metrics. Isolate other issues, such as slow database performance. This section defines the Node.js agent variables in the order they typically appear in the transaction_tracer: { section of your app's newrelic.js configuration file. Important Do not use brackets [suffix] at the end of your transaction name. New Relic automatically strips brackets from the name. Instead, use parentheses (suffix) or other symbols if needed. enabled Type Boolean Default true Environ variable NEW_RELIC_TRACER_ENABLED Server-side label Enable transaction tracing? When enabled, the agent collects slow transaction traces. explain_threshold Type Integer Default 500 Environ variable NEW_RELIC_EXPLAIN_THRESHOLD Minimum query duration (in milliseconds) for a transaction to be eligible for slow queries in transaction traces. record_sql Type String (off, obfuscated, or raw) Default off Environ variable NEW_RELIC_RECORD_SQL This option affects both slow queries and record_sql for transaction traces. It can have one of three values: off, obfuscated, or raw. When set to off no slow queries will be captured, and backtraces and SQL will not be included in transaction traces. If set to raw or obfuscated, the agent sends raw or obfuscated SQL and a slow query sample to the collector. The agent may also send SQL when other criteria are met, such as when slow_sql.enabled is set. top_n Type Integer Default 20 Environ variable NEW_RELIC_TRACER_TOP_N Defines the maximum number of requests eligible for transaction traces. Transactions are named based on the request, and top_n refers to the \"top n slowest transactions\" grouped by these names. The module replaces a recorded trace with a new trace only if the new trace is slower than the previous slowest trace of that name. The default value for this setting is top_n: 20, because the Transactions page also defaults to the 20 slowest transactions. The Node.js agent captures at least five different slow transactions in the first harvest cycle after start up. It will also reset and capture different transactions if no slow transactions have been captured for the last five harvest cycles. This allows you to see more information about more of your app's request paths, at the possible cost of not focusing on the absolutely slowest request for that harvest cycle. Tip To record the absolute slowest transaction over the last minute, you can set top_n: 0 or top_n: 1. However, this causes one very slow route to dominate your transaction traces. transaction_threshold Type Integer or apdex_f Default apdex_f Environ variable NEW_RELIC_TRACER_THRESHOLD Server-side label Threshold Threshold of web transaction response time in seconds beyond which a transaction is eligible for transaction tracing. The default value is apdex_f; this sets the trace threshold to four times your application's Apdex T. You can also enter a specific time value in milliseconds. Example: Threshold set to apdex_f The default apdex_t is 100 milliseconds. If your transaction threshold is set to apdex_f, a \"slow\" transaction is 400 milliseconds. hide_internals Type boolean Default true Environ variable NEW_RELIC_HIDE_INTERNALS The agent uses a small amount of CPU in order to hide internal properties that are attached to the web application. If you change this configuration to false, it may slightly decrease your agent overhead, but it could also have an impact on the performance of the agent. attributes.enabled Type Boolean Default true Environ variable NEW_RELIC_TRANSACTION_TRACER_ATTRIBUTES_ENABLED If true, the agent captures attributes from transaction traces. Caution Any header-related include/exclude rules must be in camelCase form to be filtered. attributes.exclude Type Array Default [] Environ variable NEW_RELIC_TRANSACTION_TRACER_ATTRIBUTES_EXCLUDE Prefix of attributes to exclude from transaction traces. Allows * as wildcard at end. attributes.include Type Array Default [] Environ variable NEW_RELIC_TRANSACTION_TRACER_ATTRIBUTES_INCLUDE Prefix of attributes to include in transaction traces. Allows * as wildcard at end. Rules variables This section defines the Node.js agent variables in the order they typically appear in the rules: { section of your app's newrelic.js configuration file. name Type Strings or regular expressions Default (none) Environ variable NEW_RELIC_NAMING_RULES A comma-delimited list of rules to match incoming request URLs and name the associated New Relic transaction. Uses the format: name: [ {pattern: 'STRING_OR_REGEX', name: 'NAME'}, {pattern: 'STRING_OR_REGEX', name: 'NAME'} ], Copy Both parameters are required. For strings, you must escape control characters. You do not need to escape control characters in regular expressions. Additional attributes are ignored. Regular expressions support JavaScript-style capture groups, and names use $1-style replacement strings. Regular expressions only find the first matching result; subsequent matches are ignored. For more information, see Node.js transaction naming API. For the NEW_RELIC_NAMING_RULES environment variable, pass the rules as comma-delimited JSON object literals: NEW_RELIC_NAMING_RULES='{\"pattern\":\"^t\",\"name\":\"u\"},{\"pattern\":\"^u\",\"name\":\"t\"}' Copy ignore Type Strings or regular expressions Default Regular expression to match socket.io long-polling requests (\"^ \\ /socket \\ .io \\ /. * \\ /xhr-polling/\"). Environ variable NEW_RELIC_IGNORING_RULES Define a list of request URLs you want the agent to ignore. Specify the list as patterns, which can be strings or regular expressions. enforce_backstop Type Boolean Default true Environ variable NEW_RELIC_ENFORCE_BACKSTOP Caution Do not change this setting unless you understand metric grouping issues. When enabled, the agent renames transactions that are not affected by other naming logic (such as the API, rules, or metric normalization rules) to NormalizedUri/*. If you set this to false, the agent sets transaction names to Uri/path/to/resource. Transaction events variables This section defines the Node.js agent variables in the order they typically appear in the transaction_events: { section of your app's newrelic.js configuration file. enabled Type Boolean Default true When enabled, the agent sends transaction events to New Relic. This event data includes transaction timing, transaction name, and any custom parameters. If this is disabled, the agent does not collect this data or send it to New Relic. max_samples_stored Type Integer Default 10000 Environ variable NEW_RELIC_TRANSACTION_EVENTS_MAX_SAMPLES_STORED Defines the maximum number of events the agent collects per minute. If there are more than this number, the agent collects a statistical sampling. We do not recommend configuring past 10,000. The server will cap data at 10,000 per-minute. Important This configuration had different behavior in agent versions lower than 6.0.0. See max_samples_stored (DEPRECATED) for agent versions 5.x or lower. max_samples_stored (DEPRECATED) Type Integer Default 20000 Defines the maximum number of events the agent stores if it is unable to communicate with the New Relic collector. The values from the previous harvest cycle will be merged into the next one, with this option limiting the maximum number. Make sure this number is greater than max_samples_per_minute; for example, set it to twice as much. Consider your memory overhead before increasing this value. Caution This configuration has different behavior starting with agent version 6.0.0 and a new recommended maximum. See max_samples_stored for agent versions 6.x or higher. max_samples_per_minute (DEPRECATED) Type Integer Default 10000 Defines the maximum number of events the agent collects per minute. If there are more than this number, the agent collects a statistical sampling. Caution This configuration has been replaced with max_samples_stored starting with version 6.0.0 of the agent. See max_samples_stored for 6.x or later agents. attributes.enabled Type Boolean Default true Environ variable NEW_RELIC_TRANSACTION_EVENTS_ATTRIBUTES_ENABLED If true, the agent captures attributes from transaction events. Caution Any header-related include/exclude rules must be in camelCase form to be filtered. attributes.exclude Type Array Default [] Environ variable NEW_RELIC_TRANSACTION_EVENTS_ATTRIBUTES_EXCLUDE Prefix of attributes to exclude from transaction events. Allows * as wildcard at end. attributes.include Type Array Default [] Environ variable NEW_RELIC_TRANSACTION_EVENTS_ATTRIBUTES_INCLUDE Prefix of attributes to include in transaction events. Allows * as wildcard at end. Browser monitoring variables This section defines the Node.js agent variables in the order they typically appear in the browser_monitoring: { section of your app's newrelic.js configuration file. enable Type Boolean Default true Environ variable NEW_RELIC_BROWSER_MONITOR_ENABLE Server-side label Enable browser monitoring? Generate JavaScript headers for browser instrumentation. Although this defaults to true, the agent doesn't inject the browser JS code unless you have enabled browser monitoring. Even if you have enabled it and added the browser timing header, you can disable browser monitoring for your app by setting this to false. debug Type Boolean Default false Environ variable NEW_RELIC_BROWSER_MONITOR_DEBUG If true, request un-minified sources from the server. attributes.enabled Type Boolean Default false Environ variable NEW_RELIC_BROWSER_MONITORING_ATTRIBUTES_ENABLED If true, the agent sends custom attributes to browser monitoring. Caution Any header-related include/exclude rules must be in camelCase form to be filtered. attributes.exclude Type Array Default [] Environ variable NEW_RELIC_BROWSER_MONITORING_ATTRIBUTES_EXCLUDE Prefix of attributes to exclude from browser monitoring. Allows * as wildcard at end. attributes.include Type Array Default [] Environ variable NEW_RELIC_BROWSER_MONITORING_ATTRIBUTES_INCLUDE Prefix of attributes to include in browser monitoring. Allows * as wildcard at end. Custom events variables This section defines the Node.js agent variables in the order they typically appear in the custom_insights_events: { section of your app's newrelic.js configuration file. Currently there are no environment variables for custom events. enabled Type Boolean Default true When enabled, the agent sends custom events recorded with recordCustomEvent() to New Relic. If this is disabled, the agent does not collect this data or send it to New Relic. max_samples_stored Type Integer Default 1000 Environ variable NEW_RELIC_CUSTOM_INSIGHTS_EVENTS_MAX_SAMPLES_STORED Defines the maximum number of custom events the agent collects per minute. If the number of custom events exceeds this limit, the agent collects a statistical sampling. Important Increasing this limit increases memory usage. Slow queries variables This section defines the Node.js agent variables in the order they typically appear in the slow_sql: { section of your app's newrelic.js configuration file. These options control behavior for slow queries, but do not affect SQL nodes in transaction traces. enabled Type Boolean Default false Environ variable NEW_RELIC_SLOW_SQL_ENABLED When enabled, the agent collects slow query details. max_samples Type Integer Default 10 Environ variable NEW_RELIC_MAX_SQL_SAMPLES Defines the maximum number of slow queries the agent collects per minute. The agent discards additional queries after the limit is reached. Important Increasing this limit increases memory usage. Custom hostname variables This section defines the Node.js agent variables in the order they typically appear in the process_host: { section of your app's newrelic.js configuration file. These options control behavior regarding the host display name in the APM UI. display_name Type String of 255 bytes or less Default (none) Environ variable NEW_RELIC_PROCESS_HOST_DISPLAY_NAME Specify a custom hostname for display in New Relic. If you do not set this field, New Relic will continue to use the default hostname found by calling os.hostname(). If you use the default hostname settings, New Relic finds the hostname through os.hostname(). If this call fails, New Relic uses the host's IP as the name. If you set ipv_preference: 4 or ipv_preference: 6, you can select the type of IP address (IPv4 or IPv6) that appears in the New Relic UI. ipv_preference Type Integer (4 or 6) Default 4 Environ variable NEW_RELIC_IPV_PREFERENCE Environment variable overrides This section defines two configuration options only available with environment variables. These overrides are not used in most configurations. NEW_RELIC_HOME Path to the directory containing newrelic.js. This is available only as an environment variable. You cannot set it in your config file. Type String Default (none) NEW_RELIC_NO_CONFIG_FILE If used, this prevents the agent from reading configuration settings from newrelic.js. Default values and values from environment variables will still be set. This is available only as an environment variable. You cannot set it in your config file. Type Boolean Default False Datastore tracer variables This section defines the Node.js agent variables in the order they typically appear in the datastore_tracer section of your app's newrelic.js configuration file. These options control behavior for collecting datastore instance metrics. instance_reporting.enabled Type Boolean Default true When enabled, the agent collects datastore instance metrics (such as host and port) for some database drivers. These are reported on slow query traces and transaction traces. database_name_reporting.enabled Type Boolean Default true When enabled, the agent collects database name on slow query traces and transaction traces for some database drivers. Cross application tracing (DEPRECATED) The Node.js agent variables that control cross application tracing typically appear in the cross_application_tracer section of your app's newrelic.js configuration file: enabled Type Boolean Default false When set to true, allows tracing of transactions across more than one New Relic-monitored applications. Important Cross application tracing (CAT) has been deprecated and will be removed in a future major release. For cross-service visibility, we recommend using distributed tracing, which is enabled by default as of agent version 8.3.0. Before enabling, read the transition guide. Error message redaction variables The Node.js agent variables that control error message redaction appear in the allow_raw_exception_messages section of your app's newrelic.js configuration file: enabled Type Boolean Default true Environ variable NEW_RELIC_ALLOW_RAW_EXCEPTION_MESSAGES_ENABLED When false, the agent will redact the messages of captured errors. Distributed tracing Important Enabling distributed tracing disables cross application tracing, and has effects on other APM features. Before enabling, read the transition guide. Requires Node.js agent version 4.7.0 or higher. Distributed tracing lets you see the path that a request takes as it travels through a distributed system. When configuring via the config file, place the following option in the distributed_tracing section. enabled Type Boolean Default true Environ variable NEW_RELIC_DISTRIBUTED_TRACING_ENABLED Set this to true to enable distributed tracing. For example, to enable this in the config file, you would use: distributed_tracing: { enabled: true } Copy exclude_newrelic_header Type Boolean Default false Set this to true to exclude the New Relic header that is attached to outbound requests, and instead only rely on W3C Trace Context Headers for distributed tracing. If this is false then both types of headers are used. For example, to enable this in the config file, you would use: distributed_tracing:{ enabled: true, exclude_newrelic_header: true } Copy Span events Span data is reported for distributed tracing. Distributed tracing must be enabled to report spans. Span configuration is set in the span_events stanza. Options include: enabled Type Boolean Default true Environ variable NEW_RELIC_SPAN_EVENTS_ENABLED Turns reporting of span events on or off. attributes.enabled Type Boolean Default true Environ variable NEW_RELIC_SPAN_EVENTS_ATTRIBUTES_ENABLED This setting can be used to turn reporting of attributes on or off for spans. If attributes.enabled at the root level is false, no attributes will be sent with spans regardless on how this is set. attributes.include Type Array Default [] Environ variable NEW_RELIC_SPAN_EVENTS_ATTRIBUTES_INCLUDE If attributes are enabled for spans, all attribute keys found in this list will be attached to spans. For more information, see the agent attribute rules. attributes.exclude Type Array Default [] Environ variable NEW_RELIC_SPAN_EVENTS_ATTRIBUTES_EXCLUDE All attribute keys found in this list will not be sent with spans. For more information, see the agent attribute rules. max_samples_stored Type Integer Default 2000 Environ variable NEW_RELIC_SPAN_EVENTS_MAX_SAMPLES_STORED Defines the maximum number of events the agent collects per minute. If there are more than this number, the agent collects a statistical sampling. We do not recommend configuring past 10k. The server will cap data at 10k per-minute. Infinite Tracing To turn on Infinite Tracing, enable distributed tracing (set distributed_tracing to enabled: true) and add the additional settings below. For an example, see Language agents: configure distributed tracing. trace_observer.host Type String Default (none) Environ variable NEW_RELIC_INFINITE_TRACING_TRACE_OBSERVER_HOST For help getting a valid Infinite Tracing trace observer host entry, see Find or create a trace observer endpoint.",

      "body": "Follow the appropriate procedure to rename your browser app depending on the deployment option you used to add it to browser. Rename app monitored by APM If you added an app to browser already being monitored by APM, the app name that appears in browser is the same as the app name in the APM UI. To rename the app, use any of these options: Option Comments Rename and continue collecting data This option is useful when you simply want to give an app a different display name (alias). To change the alias that appears in the New Relic UI, use the app's Settings page: Go to one.newrelic.com > APM > (select an app) > Settings > Application. Stop reporting under the old name To stop reporting data under the old name and begin collecting data with a new name (app identifer), use the APM agent's configuration file. This changes the identifier that New Relic's data collector uses to distinguish one app from another. Based on the data retention schedule, New Relic will retain historical data collected under the old name, and will collect and aggregate data under the new name. If one or more apps share the same name, then their data will be aggregated in the UI. Caution If you change the app identifier, a new application will appear in our user interface with the new name, and data will stop reporting to the app(s) with the old name. Rename app via JavaScript snippet This information applies if you inserted the browser agent's JavaScript snippet into your: App monitored by APM that was deployed via the copy/paste method Single page app (SPA) Any standalone browser app that is not also monitored by APM You cannot directly edit the JavaScript snippet in the existing app. Instead, to use your app with a different name: Follow standard procedures to create a new app using the copy/paste method. Provide the new name, and generate the JavaScript snippet. Copy the new JavaScript snippet. In your webpage, replace the JavaScript from your original app with the JavaScript generated for the new app name. If your standalone app has multiple names, copy the custom app IDs in your configuration script to your new app. Based on the data retention schedule, New Relic will retain historical data collected under the old name, and will collect and aggregate data under the new name. Rename app via New Relic REST API (v2) This information applies only to browser apps that are also monitored by APM. You cannot change the app name via the REST API if you used the copy/paste method to insert browser's JavaScript snippet into your app. Follow standard procedures to change the APM app alias via REST API or API Explorer.

      "body": "You can tailor the Node.js agent to your app's requirements by editing your newrelic.js config file or by setting an environment variable. The config file resides in the root directory of your app. You can also configure a few options from New Relic, or use the Node.js agent API. Important The license_key setting is required. We highly recommend setting the app_name so that your app has a meaningful name instead of the default My Application. Configuration methods and precedence The primary method to configure the Node.js agent is the agent configuration file (newrelic.js). You can also configure most settings with environment variables. You can also adjust some settings with server-side configuration. The Node.js agent uses this order of precedence for configuration methods: Node.js configuration hierarchy: Server-side configuration settings override environment variables. Environment variables override the agent config file. The config file overrides the agent defaults. Here are detailed descriptions of each configuration method: Agent configuration file The config file (newrelic.js) contains every Node.js agent setting. When you install the Node.js agent, you must copy newrelic.js into your app's root directory. Most settings are empty by default; they inherit their values from config/default.js. Environment variables Most configuration settings in newrelic.js have equivalent environment variables. These are useful, for example, if your agent runs in a PaaS environment such as Heroku or Microsoft Azure. Node.js agent environment variables always start with NEW_RELIC_. Where available, these environment variables are documented below under individual config options as the Environ variable. There are also two rarely used settings that can only be configured via environment variables. Server-side configuration Owners and Admins can view and configure a few settings directly in New Relic. Where available, the UI labels for server-side config are listed in this document under individual config options as the Server-side label. Exports variables This section defines the Node.js agent variables in the order they typically appear in the exports.config = { section of your app's newrelic.js configuration file. app_name (REQUIRED) Type String Default \"My Application\" Environ variable NEW_RELIC_APP_NAME The name New Relic uses to identify your app. For example, app_name: ['MyNodeApp']. To use multiple names for your app, specify a comma-delimited list of names. Data for all applications with the same name will be merged in the New Relic UI, so set this carefully. We highly recommend that you replace the default name with a descriptive name to avoid confusion and unintended aggregation of data. Tip For Azure users, the Node.js agent will use APP_POOL_ID if it is set, so you can use the name you chose for your Azure Web Server without setting it twice. license_key (REQUIRED) Type String Default (none) Environ variable NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY This setting is required. Your New Relic license key. For example, license_key: '40HexadecimalCharacters'. agent_enabled Type Boolean Default true Environ variable NEW_RELIC_ENABLED Set to false to stop the agent from starting up. This is useful when debugging your code requires temporarily disabling the agent. It prevents the agent from bootstrapping its instrumentation or setting up all its pieces, which prevents the agent from starting up and connecting to New Relic's servers. allow_all_headers If true, enables capture of all HTTP headers, except for those filtered by exclude rules. If false, collected headers are limited to those defined in Node.js agent attributes. Type Boolean Default false Caution Any header-related include/exclude rules must be in camelCase form to be filtered. apdex_t (DEPRECATED) Type Number Default 0.100 Server-side label Apdex T Set your Apdex T via the New Relic UI. certificates Type Array of strings Default (none) Additional certificates to trust for SSL connections, specified as an array of strings in PEM format. This affects both connections to an HTTPS proxy and connections to New Relic. Tip You can also configure the agent to read its certificates from a file: certificates: [ fs.readFileSync('myca.crt', {encoding: 'utf8'}) ] Copy high_security Type Boolean Default false Environ variable NEW_RELIC_HIGH_SECURITY When set to true, enables high security v2. You must also enable the ssl setting and enable high security in the UI. host Type String Default collector.newrelic.com Environ variable NEW_RELIC_HOST Important Do not edit this value unless New Relic Support asks you to change it. Hostname for the New Relic collector to connect to the Internet; for example, host: 'collector.newrelic.com'. labels Adds tags. Specify your tags as objects or a semicolon-delimited string of colon-separated pairs (for example, Server:One;Data Center:Primary). Type Object or string Default (none) Environ variable NEW_RELIC_LABELS port Type Integer Default 443 Environ variable NEW_RELIC_PORT Important Do not edit this value unless New Relic Support asks you to change it. Port number to connect to the New Relic collector; for example, port: 443. proxy Type String Default (none) Environ variable NEW_RELIC_PROXY_URL A URL specifying the proxy server to connect to the Internet. For example, proxy: 'http://user:pass@10.0.0.1:8000/'. Important The proxy config file setting overrides the other config file proxy settings (proxy_host, proxy_port, proxy_user, proxy_pass) if used. Similarly, the NEW_RELIC_PROXY_URL environment variable overrides the other environment variable proxy settings (NEW_RELIC_PROXY_HOST, NEW_RELIC_PROXY_PORT, NEW_RELIC_PROXY_USER, and NEW_RELIC_PROXY_PASS) if used. proxy_host Type String Default (none) Environ variable NEW_RELIC_PROXY_HOST Hostname or IP address of the proxy server to connect to the Internet. proxy_pass Type String Default (none) Environ variable NEW_RELIC_PROXY_PASS Password for authenticating to the proxy server. The agent supports only basic HTTP authentication. proxy_port Type String Default (none) Environ variable NEW_RELIC_PROXY_PORT Port number of the proxy server to connect to the Internet. proxy_user Type String Default (none) Environ variable NEW_RELIC_PROXY_USER User name for authenticating to the proxy server. The agent supports only basic HTTP authentication. Logging variables This section defines the Node.js agent variables in the order they typically appear in the logging: { section of your app's newrelic.js configuration file. enabled Type String Default true (false in serverless_mode) Environ variable NEW_RELIC_LOG_ENABLED Enables or disables agent specific logging. level Type String Default info Environ variable NEW_RELIC_LOG_LEVEL Defines the level of detail recorded in the agent logs. From least detail to most detail, possible values are fatal, error, warn, info, debug, or trace. Caution Do not use debug or trace logging unless New Relic Support asks you to use them. These levels of logging can generate excessive overhead. For most situations, use info. filepath Type String Default process.cwd() plus newrelic_agent.log Environ variable NEW_RELIC_LOG Complete path to the New Relic agent log, including the filename. Defaults to filepath: require('path').join(process.cwd(), 'newrelic_agent.log'). The agent will shut down the process if it cannot create this file. The agent creates a log file with the same permissions as the parent Node.js agent process. To write all logging to stdout, set this to stdout. To write all logging to stderr, set this to stderr. Audit logging This section defines the Node.js agent variables in the order they typically appear in the audit_log: { section of your app's newrelic.js configuration file. enabled Type Boolean Default false Environ variable NEW_RELIC_AUDIT_LOG_ENABLED When enabled, the agent logs the payloads it sends to the collector. This data is included in the main log file even when logging level is set to the lowest level. endpoints Type Array Default Empty array (include all types) Environ variable NEW_RELIC_AUDIT_LOG_ENDPOINTS The agent sends several different types of data to the collector in separate payloads. By default, all of them are included in the log file. This option makes it possible to limit logging only to specific types of data. Valid values include: agent_settings analytic_event_data connect custom_event_data error_data error_event_data metric_data preconnect shutdown span_event_data sql_trace_data transaction_sample_data API configuration This section allows you to choose which API methods are enabled. Each configuration option allows you to modularly enable API methods that are responsible for sending custom information to New Relic. Important All of these are set to false when the agent is in high security mode. custom_attributes_enabled Type Boolean Default true Environ variable NEW_RELIC_API_CUSTOM_ATTRIBUTES This option enables newrelic.addCustomAttribute and newrelic.addCustomAttributes. custom_events_enabled Type Boolean Default true Environ variable NEW_RELIC_API_CUSTOM_EVENTS This option enables recordCustomEvent. notice_error_enabled Type Boolean Default true Environ variable NEW_RELIC_API_NOTICE_ERROR This option enables newrelic.noticeError. Attributes This section defines the variables for Node.js agent attributes in the order they typically appear in the attributes: { section of your app's newrelic.js configuration file. Caution Any header-related include/exclude rules must be in camelCase form to be filtered. enabled Type Boolean Default true Environ variable NEW_RELIC_ATTRIBUTES_ENABLED If true, enables capture of attributes for all destinations. exclude Type Array Default [] Environ variable NEW_RELIC_ATTRIBUTES_EXCLUDE Prefix of attributes to exclude from all destinations. Allows * as wildcard at end. include Type Array Default [] Environ variable NEW_RELIC_ATTRIBUTES_INCLUDE Prefix of attributes to include from all destinations. Allows * as wildcard at end. include_enabled Type Boolean Default true Environ variable NEW_RELIC_ATTRIBUTES_INCLUDE_ENABLED When true, patterns may be added to the attributes.include list. Error collector variables You can manage how error are handled in New Relic. This section defines the Node.js agent variables in the order they typically appear in the error_collector: { section of your app's newrelic.js configuration file. enabled Type Boolean Default true Environ variable NEW_RELIC_ERROR_COLLECTOR_ENABLED Server-side label Enable error collection? When enabled, the agent collects error traces from your app. ignore_status_codes Type Array Default 404 Environ variable NEW_RELIC_ERROR_COLLECTOR_IGNORE_ERROR_CODES Server-side label Ignore these status codes Comma-delimited list of HTTP status codes for the error collector to ignore. Caution Errors recorded using newrelic.noticeError do not obey this configuration value. ignore_classes Type Array|Object Default [] Environ variable NEW_RELIC_ERROR_COLLECTOR_IGNORE_ERRORS Comma-delimited list of javascript error types/classes for the error collector to ignore. The following configuration /* ... */ error_collector: { ignore_classes: [\"ReferenceError\"] } /* ... */ Copy Would ignore all reference errors. Caution Errors recorded using newrelic.noticeError do not obey this configuration value. ignore_messages Type Object Default {} A javascript object describing a list of javascript classes tied to javascript error messages for the collector to ignore. The following configuration. /* ... */ error_collector: { /* ... */ ignore_messages: {\"Error\":[\"Undefined\", \"Out of time\"]} /* ... */ } /* ... */ Copy Would ignore all errors of type Error, with the exact (case-sensitive) message strings of Undefined and Out of time. Caution Errors recorded using newrelic.noticeError do not obey this configuration value. expected_status_codes Type Array Default [] Environ variable NEW_RELIC_ERROR_COLLECTOR_EXPECTED_ERROR_CODES Comma-delimited list of HTTP status codes for the error collector to mark as expected. Caution Errors recorded using newrelic.noticeError do not obey this configuration value. expected_classes Type Array Default [] Environ variable NEW_RELIC_ERROR_COLLECTOR_EXPECTED_ERRORS The following configuration /* ... */ error_collector: { expected_classes: [\"ReferenceError\"] } /* ... */ Copy Would mark all reference errors as expected. Caution Errors recorded using newrelic.noticeError do not obey this configuration value. expected_messages Type Object Default {} A javascript object describing a list of javascript classes tied to javascript error messages for the collector to ignore. The following configuration. /* ... */ error_collector: { /* ... */ expected_messages: {\"Error\":[\"Undefined\", \"Out of time\"]} /* ... */ } /* ... */ Copy Would mark all errors of type Error, with the exact (case-sensitive) message strings of Undefined and Out of time. Caution Errors recorded using newrelic.noticeError do not obey this configuration value. attributes.enabled Type Boolean Default true Environ variable NEW_RELIC_ERROR_COLLECTOR_ATTRIBUTES_ENABLED If true, the agent captures attributes from error collection. Caution Any header-related include/exclude rules must be in camelCase form to be filtered. attributes.exclude Type Array Default [] Environ variable NEW_RELIC_ERROR_COLLECTOR_ATTRIBUTES_EXCLUDE Prefix of attributes to exclude from error collection. Allows * as wildcard at end. attributes.include Type Array Default [] Environ variable NEW_RELIC_ERROR_COLLECTOR_ATTRIBUTES_INCLUDE Prefix of attributes to include in error collection. Allows * as wildcard at end. max_event_samples_stored Type Integer Default 100 Environ variable NEW_RELIC_ERROR_COLLECTOR_MAX_EVENT_SAMPLES_STORED Defines the maximum number of events the agent collects per minute. If there are more than this number, the agent collects a statistical sampling. Transaction tracer variables The agent groups your requests into transactions, which are used to: Visualize where your app spends its time (in transaction breakdowns). Identify slow requests. Group metrics. Isolate other issues, such as slow database performance. This section defines the Node.js agent variables in the order they typically appear in the transaction_tracer: { section of your app's newrelic.js configuration file. Important Do not use brackets [suffix] at the end of your transaction name. New Relic automatically strips brackets from the name. Instead, use parentheses (suffix) or other symbols if needed. enabled Type Boolean Default true Environ variable NEW_RELIC_TRACER_ENABLED Server-side label Enable transaction tracing? When enabled, the agent collects slow transaction traces. explain_threshold Type Integer Default 500 Environ variable NEW_RELIC_EXPLAIN_THRESHOLD Minimum query duration (in milliseconds) for a transaction to be eligible for slow queries in transaction traces. record_sql Type String (off, obfuscated, or raw) Default off Environ variable NEW_RELIC_RECORD_SQL This option affects both slow queries and record_sql for transaction traces. It can have one of three values: off, obfuscated, or raw. When set to off no slow queries will be captured, and backtraces and SQL will not be included in transaction traces. If set to raw or obfuscated, the agent sends raw or obfuscated SQL and a slow query sample to the collector. The agent may also send SQL when other criteria are met, such as when slow_sql.enabled is set. top_n Type Integer Default 20 Environ variable NEW_RELIC_TRACER_TOP_N Defines the maximum number of requests eligible for transaction traces. Transactions are named based on the request, and top_n refers to the \"top n slowest transactions\" grouped by these names. The module replaces a recorded trace with a new trace only if the new trace is slower than the previous slowest trace of that name. The default value for this setting is top_n: 20, because the Transactions page also defaults to the 20 slowest transactions. The Node.js agent captures at least five different slow transactions in the first harvest cycle after start up. It will also reset and capture different transactions if no slow transactions have been captured for the last five harvest cycles. This allows you to see more information about more of your app's request paths, at the possible cost of not focusing on the absolutely slowest request for that harvest cycle. Tip To record the absolute slowest transaction over the last minute, you can set top_n: 0 or top_n: 1. However, this causes one very slow route to dominate your transaction traces. transaction_threshold Type Integer or apdex_f Default apdex_f Environ variable NEW_RELIC_TRACER_THRESHOLD Server-side label Threshold Threshold of web transaction response time in seconds beyond which a transaction is eligible for transaction tracing. The default value is apdex_f; this sets the trace threshold to four times your application's Apdex T. You can also enter a specific time value in milliseconds. Example: Threshold set to apdex_f The default apdex_t is 100 milliseconds. If your transaction threshold is set to apdex_f, a \"slow\" transaction is 400 milliseconds. hide_internals Type boolean Default true Environ variable NEW_RELIC_HIDE_INTERNALS The agent uses a small amount of CPU in order to hide internal properties that are attached to the web application. If you change this configuration to false, it may slightly decrease your agent overhead, but it could also have an impact on the performance of the agent. attributes.enabled Type Boolean Default true Environ variable NEW_RELIC_TRANSACTION_TRACER_ATTRIBUTES_ENABLED If true, the agent captures attributes from transaction traces. Caution Any header-related include/exclude rules must be in camelCase form to be filtered. attributes.exclude Type Array Default [] Environ variable NEW_RELIC_TRANSACTION_TRACER_ATTRIBUTES_EXCLUDE Prefix of attributes to exclude from transaction traces. Allows * as wildcard at end. attributes.include Type Array Default [] Environ variable NEW_RELIC_TRANSACTION_TRACER_ATTRIBUTES_INCLUDE Prefix of attributes to include in transaction traces. Allows * as wildcard at end. Rules variables This section defines the Node.js agent variables in the order they typically appear in the rules: { section of your app's newrelic.js configuration file. name Type Strings or regular expressions Default (none) Environ variable NEW_RELIC_NAMING_RULES A comma-delimited list of rules to match incoming request URLs and name the associated New Relic transaction. Uses the format: name: [ {pattern: 'STRING_OR_REGEX', name: 'NAME'}, {pattern: 'STRING_OR_REGEX', name: 'NAME'} ], Copy Both parameters are required. For strings, you must escape control characters. You do not need to escape control characters in regular expressions. Additional attributes are ignored. Regular expressions support JavaScript-style capture groups, and names use $1-style replacement strings. Regular expressions only find the first matching result; subsequent matches are ignored. For more information, see Node.js transaction naming API. For the NEW_RELIC_NAMING_RULES environment variable, pass the rules as comma-delimited JSON object literals: NEW_RELIC_NAMING_RULES='{\"pattern\":\"^t\",\"name\":\"u\"},{\"pattern\":\"^u\",\"name\":\"t\"}' Copy ignore Type Strings or regular expressions Default Regular expression to match socket.io long-polling requests (\"^ \\ /socket \\ .io \\ /. * \\ /xhr-polling/\"). Environ variable NEW_RELIC_IGNORING_RULES Define a list of request URLs you want the agent to ignore. Specify the list as patterns, which can be strings or regular expressions. enforce_backstop Type Boolean Default true Environ variable NEW_RELIC_ENFORCE_BACKSTOP Caution Do not change this setting unless you understand metric grouping issues. When enabled, the agent renames transactions that are not affected by other naming logic (such as the API, rules, or metric normalization rules) to NormalizedUri/*. If you set this to false, the agent sets transaction names to Uri/path/to/resource. Transaction events variables This section defines the Node.js agent variables in the order they typically appear in the transaction_events: { section of your app's newrelic.js configuration file. enabled Type Boolean Default true When enabled, the agent sends transaction events to New Relic. This event data includes transaction timing, transaction name, and any custom parameters. If this is disabled, the agent does not collect this data or send it to New Relic. max_samples_stored Type Integer Default 10000 Environ variable NEW_RELIC_TRANSACTION_EVENTS_MAX_SAMPLES_STORED Defines the maximum number of events the agent collects per minute. If there are more than this number, the agent collects a statistical sampling. We do not recommend configuring past 10,000. The server will cap data at 10,000 per-minute. Important This configuration had different behavior in agent versions lower than 6.0.0. See max_samples_stored (DEPRECATED) for agent versions 5.x or lower. max_samples_stored (DEPRECATED) Type Integer Default 20000 Defines the maximum number of events the agent stores if it is unable to communicate with the New Relic collector. The values from the previous harvest cycle will be merged into the next one, with this option limiting the maximum number. Make sure this number is greater than max_samples_per_minute; for example, set it to twice as much. Consider your memory overhead before increasing this value. Caution This configuration has different behavior starting with agent version 6.0.0 and a new recommended maximum. See max_samples_stored for agent versions 6.x or higher. max_samples_per_minute (DEPRECATED) Type Integer Default 10000 Defines the maximum number of events the agent collects per minute. If there are more than this number, the agent collects a statistical sampling. Caution This configuration has been replaced with max_samples_stored starting with version 6.0.0 of the agent. See max_samples_stored for 6.x or later agents. attributes.enabled Type Boolean Default true Environ variable NEW_RELIC_TRANSACTION_EVENTS_ATTRIBUTES_ENABLED If true, the agent captures attributes from transaction events. Caution Any header-related include/exclude rules must be in camelCase form to be filtered. attributes.exclude Type Array Default [] Environ variable NEW_RELIC_TRANSACTION_EVENTS_ATTRIBUTES_EXCLUDE Prefix of attributes to exclude from transaction events. Allows * as wildcard at end. attributes.include Type Array Default [] Environ variable NEW_RELIC_TRANSACTION_EVENTS_ATTRIBUTES_INCLUDE Prefix of attributes to include in transaction events. Allows * as wildcard at end. Browser monitoring variables This section defines the Node.js agent variables in the order they typically appear in the browser_monitoring: { section of your app's newrelic.js configuration file. enable Type Boolean Default true Environ variable NEW_RELIC_BROWSER_MONITOR_ENABLE Server-side label Enable browser monitoring? Generate JavaScript headers for browser instrumentation. Although this defaults to true, the agent doesn't inject the browser JS code unless you have enabled browser monitoring. Even if you have enabled it and added the browser timing header, you can disable browser monitoring for your app by setting this to false. debug Type Boolean Default false Environ variable NEW_RELIC_BROWSER_MONITOR_DEBUG If true, request un-minified sources from the server. attributes.enabled Type Boolean Default false Environ variable NEW_RELIC_BROWSER_MONITORING_ATTRIBUTES_ENABLED If true, the agent sends custom attributes to browser monitoring. Caution Any header-related include/exclude rules must be in camelCase form to be filtered. attributes.exclude Type Array Default [] Environ variable NEW_RELIC_BROWSER_MONITORING_ATTRIBUTES_EXCLUDE Prefix of attributes to exclude from browser monitoring. Allows * as wildcard at end. attributes.include Type Array Default [] Environ variable NEW_RELIC_BROWSER_MONITORING_ATTRIBUTES_INCLUDE Prefix of attributes to include in browser monitoring. Allows * as wildcard at end. Custom events variables This section defines the Node.js agent variables in the order they typically appear in the custom_insights_events: { section of your app's newrelic.js configuration file. Currently there are no environment variables for custom events. enabled Type Boolean Default true When enabled, the agent sends custom events recorded with recordCustomEvent() to New Relic. If this is disabled, the agent does not collect this data or send it to New Relic. max_samples_stored Type Integer Default 1000 Environ variable NEW_RELIC_CUSTOM_INSIGHTS_EVENTS_MAX_SAMPLES_STORED Defines the maximum number of custom events the agent collects per minute. If the number of custom events exceeds this limit, the agent collects a statistical sampling. Important Increasing this limit increases memory usage. Slow queries variables This section defines the Node.js agent variables in the order they typically appear in the slow_sql: { section of your app's newrelic.js configuration file. These options control behavior for slow queries, but do not affect SQL nodes in transaction traces. enabled Type Boolean Default false Environ variable NEW_RELIC_SLOW_SQL_ENABLED When enabled, the agent collects slow query details. max_samples Type Integer Default 10 Environ variable NEW_RELIC_MAX_SQL_SAMPLES Defines the maximum number of slow queries the agent collects per minute. The agent discards additional queries after the limit is reached. Important Increasing this limit increases memory usage. Custom hostname variables This section defines the Node.js agent variables in the order they typically appear in the process_host: { section of your app's newrelic.js configuration file. These options control behavior regarding the host display name in the APM UI. display_name Type String of 255 bytes or less Default (none) Environ variable NEW_RELIC_PROCESS_HOST_DISPLAY_NAME Specify a custom hostname for display in New Relic. If you do not set this field, New Relic will continue to use the default hostname found by calling os.hostname(). If you use the default hostname settings, New Relic finds the hostname through os.hostname(). If this call fails, New Relic uses the host's IP as the name. If you set ipv_preference: 4 or ipv_preference: 6, you can select the type of IP address (IPv4 or IPv6) that appears in the New Relic UI. ipv_preference Type Integer (4 or 6) Default 4 Environ variable NEW_RELIC_IPV_PREFERENCE Environment variable overrides This section defines two configuration options only available with environment variables. These overrides are not used in most configurations. NEW_RELIC_HOME Path to the directory containing newrelic.js. This is available only as an environment variable. You cannot set it in your config file. Type String Default (none) NEW_RELIC_NO_CONFIG_FILE If used, this prevents the agent from reading configuration settings from newrelic.js. Default values and values from environment variables will still be set. This is available only as an environment variable. You cannot set it in your config file. Type Boolean Default False Datastore tracer variables This section defines the Node.js agent variables in the order they typically appear in the datastore_tracer section of your app's newrelic.js configuration file. These options control behavior for collecting datastore instance metrics. instance_reporting.enabled Type Boolean Default true When enabled, the agent collects datastore instance metrics (such as host and port) for some database drivers. These are reported on slow query traces and transaction traces. database_name_reporting.enabled Type Boolean Default true When enabled, the agent collects database name on slow query traces and transaction traces for some database drivers. Cross application tracing (DEPRECATED) The Node.js agent variables that control cross application tracing typically appear in the cross_application_tracer section of your app's newrelic.js configuration file: enabled Type Boolean Default false When set to true, allows tracing of transactions across more than one New Relic-monitored applications. Important Cross application tracing (CAT) has been deprecated and will be removed in a future major release. For cross-service visibility, we recommend using distributed tracing, which is enabled by default as of agent version 8.3.0. Before enabling, read the transition guide. Error message redaction variables The Node.js agent variables that control error message redaction appear in the allow_raw_exception_messages section of your app's newrelic.js configuration file: enabled Type Boolean Default true Environ variable NEW_RELIC_ALLOW_RAW_EXCEPTION_MESSAGES_ENABLED When false, the agent will redact the messages of captured errors. Distributed tracing Important Enabling distributed tracing disables cross application tracing, and has effects on other APM features. Before enabling, read the transition guide. Requires Node.js agent version 4.7.0 or higher. Distributed tracing lets you see the path that a request takes as it travels through a distributed system. When configuring via the config file, place the following option in the distributed_tracing section. enabled Type Boolean Default true Environ variable NEW_RELIC_DISTRIBUTED_TRACING_ENABLED Set this to true to enable distributed tracing. For example, to enable this in the config file, you would use: distributed_tracing: { enabled: true } Copy exclude_newrelic_header Type Boolean Default false Set this to true to exclude the New Relic header that is attached to outbound requests, and instead only rely on W3C Trace Context Headers for distributed tracing. If this is false then both types of headers are used. For example, to enable this in the config file, you would use: distributed_tracing:{ enabled: true, exclude_newrelic_header: true } Copy Span events Span data is reported for distributed tracing. Distributed tracing must be enabled to report spans. Span configuration is set in the span_events stanza. Options include: enabled Type Boolean Default true Environ variable NEW_RELIC_SPAN_EVENTS_ENABLED Turns reporting of span events on or off. attributes.enabled Type Boolean Default true Environ variable NEW_RELIC_SPAN_EVENTS_ATTRIBUTES_ENABLED This setting can be used to turn reporting of attributes on or off for spans. If attributes.enabled at the root level is false, no attributes will be sent with spans regardless on how this is set. attributes.include Type Array Default [] Environ variable NEW_RELIC_SPAN_EVENTS_ATTRIBUTES_INCLUDE If attributes are enabled for spans, all attribute keys found in this list will be attached to spans. For more information, see the agent attribute rules. attributes.exclude Type Array Default [] Environ variable NEW_RELIC_SPAN_EVENTS_ATTRIBUTES_EXCLUDE All attribute keys found in this list will not be sent with spans. For more information, see the agent attribute rules. max_samples_stored Type Integer Default 2000 Environ variable NEW_RELIC_SPAN_EVENTS_MAX_SAMPLES_STORED Defines the maximum number of events the agent collects per minute. If there are more than this number, the agent collects a statistical sampling. We do not recommend configuring past 10k. The server will cap data at 10k per-minute. Infinite Tracing To turn on Infinite Tracing, enable distributed tracing (set distributed_tracing to enabled: true) and add the additional settings below. For an example, see Language agents: configure distributed tracing. trace_observer.host Type String Default (none) Environ variable NEW_RELIC_INFINITE_TRACING_TRACE_OBSERVER_HOST For help getting a valid Infinite Tracing trace observer host entry, see Find or create a trace observer endpoint.",

      "body": "Follow the appropriate procedure to rename your browser app depending on the deployment option you used to add it to browser. Rename app monitored by APM If you added an app to browser already being monitored by APM, the app name that appears in browser is the same as the app name in the APM UI. To rename the app, use any of these options: Option Comments Rename and continue collecting data This option is useful when you simply want to give an app a different display name (alias). To change the alias that appears in the New Relic UI, use the app's Settings page: Go to one.newrelic.com > APM > (select an app) > Settings > Application. Stop reporting under the old name To stop reporting data under the old name and begin collecting data with a new name (app identifer), use the APM agent's configuration file. This changes the identifier that New Relic's data collector uses to distinguish one app from another. Based on the data retention schedule, New Relic will retain historical data collected under the old name, and will collect and aggregate data under the new name. If one or more apps share the same name, then their data will be aggregated in the UI. Caution If you change the app identifier, a new application will appear in our user interface with the new name, and data will stop reporting to the app(s) with the old name. Rename app via JavaScript snippet This information applies if you inserted the browser agent's JavaScript snippet into your: App monitored by APM that was deployed via the copy/paste method Single page app (SPA) Any standalone browser app that is not also monitored by APM You cannot directly edit the JavaScript snippet in the existing app. Instead, to use your app with a different name: Follow standard procedures to create a new app using the copy/paste method. Provide the new name, and generate the JavaScript snippet. Copy the new JavaScript snippet. In your webpage, replace the JavaScript from your original app with the JavaScript generated for the new app name. If your standalone app has multiple names, copy the custom app IDs in your configuration script to your new app. Based on the data retention schedule, New Relic will retain historical data collected under the old name, and will collect and aggregate data under the new name. Rename app via New Relic REST API (v2) This information applies only to browser apps that are also monitored by APM. You cannot change the app name via the REST API if you used the copy/paste method to insert browser's JavaScript snippet into your app. Follow standard procedures to change the APM app alias via REST API or API Explorer. New Relic automatically changes the display name for the app everywhere in the New Relic UI, including browser.",

      "body": "You can tailor the Node.js agent to your app's requirements by editing your newrelic.js config file or by setting an environment variable. The config file resides in the root directory of your app. You can also configure a few options from New Relic, or use the Node.js agent API. Important The license_key setting is required. We highly recommend setting the app_name so that your app has a meaningful name instead of the default My Application. Configuration methods and precedence The primary method to configure the Node.js agent is the agent configuration file (newrelic.js). You can also configure most settings with environment variables. You can also adjust some settings with server-side configuration. The Node.js agent uses this order of precedence for configuration methods: Node.js configuration hierarchy: Server-side configuration settings override environment variables. Environment variables override the agent config file. The config file overrides the agent defaults. Here are detailed descriptions of each configuration method: Agent configuration file The config file (newrelic.js) contains every Node.js agent setting. When you install the Node.js agent, you must copy newrelic.js into your app's root directory. Most settings are empty by default; they inherit their values from config/default.js. Environment variables Most configuration settings in newrelic.js have equivalent environment variables. These are useful, for example, if your agent runs in a PaaS environment such as Heroku or Microsoft Azure. Node.js agent environment variables always start with NEW_RELIC_. Where available, these environment variables are documented below under individual config options as the Environ variable. There are also two rarely used settings that can only be configured via environment variables. Server-side configuration Owners and Admins can view and configure a few settings directly in New Relic. Where available, the UI labels for server-side config are listed in this document under individual config options as the Server-side label. Exports variables This section defines the Node.js agent variables in the order they typically appear in the exports.config = { section of your app's newrelic.js configuration file. app_name (REQUIRED) Type String Default \"My Application\" Environ variable NEW_RELIC_APP_NAME The name New Relic uses to identify your app. For example, app_name: ['MyNodeApp']. To use multiple names for your app, specify a comma-delimited list of names. Data for all applications with the same name will be merged in the New Relic UI, so set this carefully. We highly recommend that you replace the default name with a descriptive name to avoid confusion and unintended aggregation of data. Tip For Azure users, the Node.js agent will use APP_POOL_ID if it is set, so you can use the name you chose for your Azure Web Server without setting it twice. license_key (REQUIRED) Type String Default (none) Environ variable NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY This setting is required. Your New Relic license key. For example, license_key: '40HexadecimalCharacters'. agent_enabled Type Boolean Default true Environ variable NEW_RELIC_ENABLED Set to false to stop the agent from starting up. This is useful when debugging your code requires temporarily disabling the agent. It prevents the agent from bootstrapping its instrumentation or setting up all its pieces, which prevents the agent from starting up and connecting to New Relic's servers. allow_all_headers If true, enables capture of all HTTP headers, except for those filtered by exclude rules. If false, collected headers are limited to those defined in Node.js agent attributes. Type Boolean Default false Caution Any header-related include/exclude rules must be in camelCase form to be filtered. apdex_t (DEPRECATED) Type Number Default 0.100 Server-side label Apdex T Set your Apdex T via the New Relic UI. certificates Type Array of strings Default (none) Additional certificates to trust for SSL connections, specified as an array of strings in PEM format. This affects both connections to an HTTPS proxy and connections to New Relic. Tip You can also configure the agent to read its certificates from a file: certificates: [ fs.readFileSync('myca.crt', {encoding: 'utf8'}) ] Copy high_security Type Boolean Default false Environ variable NEW_RELIC_HIGH_SECURITY When set to true, enables high security v2. You must also enable the ssl setting and enable high security in the UI. host Type String Default collector.newrelic.com Environ variable NEW_RELIC_HOST Important Do not edit this value unless New Relic Support asks you to change it. Hostname for the New Relic collector to connect to the Internet; for example, host: 'collector.newrelic.com'. labels Adds tags. Specify your tags as objects or a semicolon-delimited string of colon-separated pairs (for example, Server:One;Data Center:Primary). Type Object or string Default (none) Environ variable NEW_RELIC_LABELS port Type Integer Default 443 Environ variable NEW_RELIC_PORT Important Do not edit this value unless New Relic Support asks you to change it. Port number to connect to the New Relic collector; for example, port: 443. proxy Type String Default (none) Environ variable NEW_RELIC_PROXY_URL A URL specifying the proxy server to connect to the Internet. For example, proxy: 'http://user:pass@10.0.0.1:8000/'. Important The proxy config file setting overrides the other config file proxy settings (proxy_host, proxy_port, proxy_user, proxy_pass) if used. Similarly, the NEW_RELIC_PROXY_URL environment variable overrides the other environment variable proxy settings (NEW_RELIC_PROXY_HOST, NEW_RELIC_PROXY_PORT, NEW_RELIC_PROXY_USER, and NEW_RELIC_PROXY_PASS) if used. proxy_host Type String Default (none) Environ variable NEW_RELIC_PROXY_HOST Hostname or IP address of the proxy server to connect to the Internet. proxy_pass Type String Default (none) Environ variable NEW_RELIC_PROXY_PASS Password for authenticating to the proxy server. The agent supports only basic HTTP authentication. proxy_port Type String Default (none) Environ variable NEW_RELIC_PROXY_PORT Port number of the proxy server to connect to the Internet. proxy_user Type String Default (none) Environ variable NEW_RELIC_PROXY_USER User name for authenticating to the proxy server. The agent supports only basic HTTP authentication. Logging variables This section defines the Node.js agent variables in the order they typically appear in the logging: { section of your app's newrelic.js configuration file. enabled Type String Default true (false in serverless_mode) Environ variable NEW_RELIC_LOG_ENABLED Enables or disables agent specific logging. level Type String Default info Environ variable NEW_RELIC_LOG_LEVEL Defines the level of detail recorded in the agent logs. From least detail to most detail, possible values are fatal, error, warn, info, debug, or trace. Caution Do not use debug or trace logging unless New Relic Support asks you to use them. These levels of logging can generate excessive overhead. For most situations, use info. filepath Type String Default process.cwd() plus newrelic_agent.log Environ variable NEW_RELIC_LOG Complete path to the New Relic agent log, including the filename. Defaults to filepath: require('path').join(process.cwd(), 'newrelic_agent.log'). The agent will shut down the process if it cannot create this file. The agent creates a log file with the same permissions as the parent Node.js agent process. To write all logging to stdout, set this to stdout. To write all logging to stderr, set this to stderr. Audit logging This section defines the Node.js agent variables in the order they typically appear in the audit_log: { section of your app's newrelic.js configuration file. enabled Type Boolean Default false Environ variable NEW_RELIC_AUDIT_LOG_ENABLED When enabled, the agent logs the payloads it sends to the collector. This data is included in the main log file even when logging level is set to the lowest level. endpoints Type Array Default Empty array (include all types) Environ variable NEW_RELIC_AUDIT_LOG_ENDPOINTS The agent sends several different types of data to the collector in separate payloads. By default, all of them are included in the log file. This option makes it possible to limit logging only to specific types of data. Valid values include: agent_settings analytic_event_data connect custom_event_data error_data error_event_data metric_data preconnect shutdown span_event_data sql_trace_data transaction_sample_data API configuration This section allows you to choose which API methods are enabled. Each configuration option allows you to modularly enable API methods that are responsible for sending custom information to New Relic. Important All of these are set to false when the agent is in high security mode. custom_attributes_enabled Type Boolean Default true Environ variable NEW_RELIC_API_CUSTOM_ATTRIBUTES This option enables newrelic.addCustomAttribute and newrelic.addCustomAttributes. custom_events_enabled Type Boolean Default true Environ variable NEW_RELIC_API_CUSTOM_EVENTS This option enables recordCustomEvent. notice_error_enabled Type Boolean Default true Environ variable NEW_RELIC_API_NOTICE_ERROR This option enables newrelic.noticeError. Attributes This section defines the variables for Node.js agent attributes in the order they typically appear in the attributes: { section of your app's newrelic.js configuration file. Caution Any header-related include/exclude rules must be in camelCase form to be filtered. enabled Type Boolean Default true Environ variable NEW_RELIC_ATTRIBUTES_ENABLED If true, enables capture of attributes for all destinations. exclude Type Array Default [] Environ variable NEW_RELIC_ATTRIBUTES_EXCLUDE Prefix of attributes to exclude from all destinations. Allows * as wildcard at end. include Type Array Default [] Environ variable NEW_RELIC_ATTRIBUTES_INCLUDE Prefix of attributes to include from all destinations. Allows * as wildcard at end. include_enabled Type Boolean Default true Environ variable NEW_RELIC_ATTRIBUTES_INCLUDE_ENABLED When true, patterns may be added to the attributes.include list. Error collector variables You can manage how error are handled in New Relic. This section defines the Node.js agent variables in the order they typically appear in the error_collector: { section of your app's newrelic.js configuration file. enabled Type Boolean Default true Environ variable NEW_RELIC_ERROR_COLLECTOR_ENABLED Server-side label Enable error collection? When enabled, the agent collects error traces from your app. ignore_status_codes Type Array Default 404 Environ variable NEW_RELIC_ERROR_COLLECTOR_IGNORE_ERROR_CODES Server-side label Ignore these status codes Comma-delimited list of HTTP status codes for the error collector to ignore. Caution Errors recorded using newrelic.noticeError do not obey this configuration value. ignore_classes Type Array|Object Default [] Environ variable NEW_RELIC_ERROR_COLLECTOR_IGNORE_ERRORS Comma-delimited list of javascript error types/classes for the error collector to ignore. The following configuration /* ... */ error_collector: { ignore_classes: [\"ReferenceError\"] } /* ... */ Copy Would ignore all reference errors. Caution Errors recorded using newrelic.noticeError do not obey this configuration value. ignore_messages Type Object Default {} A javascript object describing a list of javascript classes tied to javascript error messages for the collector to ignore. The following configuration. /* ... */ error_collector: { /* ... */ ignore_messages: {\"Error\":[\"Undefined\", \"Out of time\"]} /* ... */ } /* ... */ Copy Would ignore all errors of type Error, with the exact (case-sensitive) message strings of Undefined and Out of time. Caution Errors recorded using newrelic.noticeError do not obey this configuration value. expected_status_codes Type Array Default [] Environ variable NEW_RELIC_ERROR_COLLECTOR_EXPECTED_ERROR_CODES Comma-delimited list of HTTP status codes for the error collector to mark as expected. Caution Errors recorded using newrelic.noticeError do not obey this configuration value. expected_classes Type Array Default [] Environ variable NEW_RELIC_ERROR_COLLECTOR_EXPECTED_ERRORS The following configuration /* ... */ error_collector: { expected_classes: [\"ReferenceError\"] } /* ... */ Copy Would mark all reference errors as expected. Caution Errors recorded using newrelic.noticeError do not obey this configuration value. expected_messages Type Object Default {} A javascript object describing a list of javascript classes tied to javascript error messages for the collector to ignore. The following configuration. /* ... */ error_collector: { /* ... */ expected_messages: {\"Error\":[\"Undefined\", \"Out of time\"]} /* ... */ } /* ... */ Copy Would mark all errors of type Error, with the exact (case-sensitive) message strings of Undefined and Out of time. Caution Errors recorded using newrelic.noticeError do not obey this configuration value. attributes.enabled Type Boolean Default true Environ variable NEW_RELIC_ERROR_COLLECTOR_ATTRIBUTES_ENABLED If true, the agent captures attributes from error collection. Caution Any header-related include/exclude rules must be in camelCase form to be filtered. attributes.exclude Type Array Default [] Environ variable NEW_RELIC_ERROR_COLLECTOR_ATTRIBUTES_EXCLUDE Prefix of attributes to exclude from error collection. Allows * as wildcard at end. attributes.include Type Array Default [] Environ variable NEW_RELIC_ERROR_COLLECTOR_ATTRIBUTES_INCLUDE Prefix of attributes to include in error collection. Allows * as wildcard at end. max_event_samples_stored Type Integer Default 100 Environ variable NEW_RELIC_ERROR_COLLECTOR_MAX_EVENT_SAMPLES_STORED Defines the maximum number of events the agent collects per minute. If there are more than this number, the agent collects a statistical sampling. Transaction tracer variables The agent groups your requests into transactions, which are used to: Visualize where your app spends its time (in transaction breakdowns). Identify slow requests. Group metrics. Isolate other issues, such as slow database performance. This section defines the Node.js agent variables in the order they typically appear in the transaction_tracer: { section of your app's newrelic.js configuration file. Important Do not use brackets [suffix] at the end of your transaction name. New Relic automatically strips brackets from the name. Instead, use parentheses (suffix) or other symbols if needed. enabled Type Boolean Default true Environ variable NEW_RELIC_TRACER_ENABLED Server-side label Enable transaction tracing? When enabled, the agent collects slow transaction traces. explain_threshold Type Integer Default 500 Environ variable NEW_RELIC_EXPLAIN_THRESHOLD Minimum query duration (in milliseconds) for a transaction to be eligible for slow queries in transaction traces. record_sql Type String (off, obfuscated, or raw) Default off Environ variable NEW_RELIC_RECORD_SQL This option affects both slow queries and record_sql for transaction traces. It can have one of three values: off, obfuscated, or raw. When set to off no slow queries will be captured, and backtraces and SQL will not be included in transaction traces. If set to raw or obfuscated, the agent sends raw or obfuscated SQL and a slow query sample to the collector. The agent may also send SQL when other criteria are met, such as when slow_sql.enabled is set. top_n Type Integer Default 20 Environ variable NEW_RELIC_TRACER_TOP_N Defines the maximum number of requests eligible for transaction traces. Transactions are named based on the request, and top_n refers to the \"top n slowest transactions\" grouped by these names. The module replaces a recorded trace with a new trace only if the new trace is slower than the previous slowest trace of that name. The default value for this setting is top_n: 20, because the Transactions page also defaults to the 20 slowest transactions. The Node.js agent captures at least five different slow transactions in the first harvest cycle after start up. It will also reset and capture different transactions if no slow transactions have been captured for the last five harvest cycles. This allows you to see more information about more of your app's request paths, at the possible cost of not focusing on the absolutely slowest request for that harvest cycle. Tip To record the absolute slowest transaction over the last minute, you can set top_n: 0 or top_n: 1. However, this causes one very slow route to dominate your transaction traces. transaction_threshold Type Integer or apdex_f Default apdex_f Environ variable NEW_RELIC_TRACER_THRESHOLD Server-side label Threshold Threshold of web transaction response time in seconds beyond which a transaction is eligible for transaction tracing. The default value is apdex_f; this sets the trace threshold to four times your application's Apdex T. You can also enter a specific time value in milliseconds. Example: Threshold set to apdex_f The default apdex_t is 100 milliseconds. If your transaction threshold is set to apdex_f, a \"slow\" transaction is 400 milliseconds. hide_internals Type boolean Default true Environ variable NEW_RELIC_HIDE_INTERNALS The agent uses a small amount of CPU in order to hide internal properties that are attached to the web application. If you change this configuration to false, it may slightly decrease your agent overhead, but it could also have an impact on the performance of the agent. attributes.enabled Type Boolean Default true Environ variable NEW_RELIC_TRANSACTION_TRACER_ATTRIBUTES_ENABLED If true, the agent captures attributes from transaction traces. Caution Any header-related include/exclude rules must be in camelCase form to be filtered. attributes.exclude Type Array Default [] Environ variable NEW_RELIC_TRANSACTION_TRACER_ATTRIBUTES_EXCLUDE Prefix of attributes to exclude from transaction traces. Allows * as wildcard at end. attributes.include Type Array Default [] Environ variable NEW_RELIC_TRANSACTION_TRACER_ATTRIBUTES_INCLUDE Prefix of attributes to include in transaction traces. Allows * as wildcard at end. Rules variables This section defines the Node.js agent variables in the order they typically appear in the rules: { section of your app's newrelic.js configuration file. name Type Strings or regular expressions Default (none) Environ variable NEW_RELIC_NAMING_RULES A comma-delimited list of rules to match incoming request URLs and name the associated New Relic transaction. Uses the format: name: [ {pattern: 'STRING_OR_REGEX', name: 'NAME'}, {pattern: 'STRING_OR_REGEX', name: 'NAME'} ], Copy Both parameters are required. For strings, you must escape control characters. You do not need to escape control characters in regular expressions. Additional attributes are ignored. Regular expressions support JavaScript-style capture groups, and names use $1-style replacement strings. Regular expressions only find the first matching result; subsequent matches are ignored. For more information, see Node.js transaction naming API. For the NEW_RELIC_NAMING_RULES environment variable, pass the rules as comma-delimited JSON object literals: NEW_RELIC_NAMING_RULES='{\"pattern\":\"^t\",\"name\":\"u\"},{\"pattern\":\"^u\",\"name\":\"t\"}' Copy ignore Type Strings or regular expressions Default Regular expression to match socket.io long-polling requests (\"^ \\ /socket \\ .io \\ /. * \\ /xhr-polling/\"). Environ variable NEW_RELIC_IGNORING_RULES Define a list of request URLs you want the agent to ignore. Specify the list as patterns, which can be strings or regular expressions. enforce_backstop Type Boolean Default true Environ variable NEW_RELIC_ENFORCE_BACKSTOP Caution Do not change this setting unless you understand metric grouping issues. When enabled, the agent renames transactions that are not affected by other naming logic (such as the API, rules, or metric normalization rules) to NormalizedUri/*. If you set this to false, the agent sets transaction names to Uri/path/to/resource. Transaction events variables This section defines the Node.js agent variables in the order they typically appear in the transaction_events: { section of your app's newrelic.js configuration file. enabled Type Boolean Default true When enabled, the agent sends transaction events to New Relic. This event data includes transaction timing, transaction name, and any custom parameters. If this is disabled, the agent does not collect this data or send it to New Relic. max_samples_stored Type Integer Default 10000 Environ variable NEW_RELIC_TRANSACTION_EVENTS_MAX_SAMPLES_STORED Defines the maximum number of events the agent collects per minute. If there are more than this number, the agent collects a statistical sampling. We do not recommend configuring past 10,000. The server will cap data at 10,000 per-minute. Important This configuration had different behavior in agent versions lower than 6.0.0. See max_samples_stored (DEPRECATED) for agent versions 5.x or lower. max_samples_stored (DEPRECATED) Type Integer Default 20000 Defines the maximum number of events the agent stores if it is unable to communicate with the New Relic collector. The values from the previous harvest cycle will be merged into the next one, with this option limiting the maximum number. Make sure this number is greater than max_samples_per_minute; for example, set it to twice as much. Consider your memory overhead before increasing this value. Caution This configuration has different behavior starting with agent version 6.0.0 and a new recommended maximum. See max_samples_stored for agent versions 6.x or higher. max_samples_per_minute (DEPRECATED) Type Integer Default 10000 Defines the maximum number of events the agent collects per minute. If there are more than this number, the agent collects a statistical sampling. Caution This configuration has been replaced with max_samples_stored starting with version 6.0.0 of the agent. See max_samples_stored for 6.x or later agents. attributes.enabled Type Boolean Default true Environ variable NEW_RELIC_TRANSACTION_EVENTS_ATTRIBUTES_ENABLED If true, the agent captures attributes from transaction events. Caution Any header-related include/exclude rules must be in camelCase form to be filtered. attributes.exclude Type Array Default [] Environ variable NEW_RELIC_TRANSACTION_EVENTS_ATTRIBUTES_EXCLUDE Prefix of attributes to exclude from transaction events. Allows * as wildcard at end. attributes.include Type Array Default [] Environ variable NEW_RELIC_TRANSACTION_EVENTS_ATTRIBUTES_INCLUDE Prefix of attributes to include in transaction events. Allows * as wildcard at end. Browser monitoring variables This section defines the Node.js agent variables in the order they typically appear in the browser_monitoring: { section of your app's newrelic.js configuration file. enable Type Boolean Default true Environ variable NEW_RELIC_BROWSER_MONITOR_ENABLE Server-side label Enable browser monitoring? Generate JavaScript headers for browser instrumentation. Although this defaults to true, the agent doesn't inject the browser JS code unless you have enabled browser monitoring. Even if you have enabled it and added the browser timing header, you can disable browser monitoring for your app by setting this to false. debug Type Boolean Default false Environ variable NEW_RELIC_BROWSER_MONITOR_DEBUG If true, request un-minified sources from the server. attributes.enabled Type Boolean Default false Environ variable NEW_RELIC_BROWSER_MONITORING_ATTRIBUTES_ENABLED If true, the agent sends custom attributes to browser monitoring. Caution Any header-related include/exclude rules must be in camelCase form to be filtered. attributes.exclude Type Array Default [] Environ variable NEW_RELIC_BROWSER_MONITORING_ATTRIBUTES_EXCLUDE Prefix of attributes to exclude from browser monitoring. Allows * as wildcard at end. attributes.include Type Array Default [] Environ variable NEW_RELIC_BROWSER_MONITORING_ATTRIBUTES_INCLUDE Prefix of attributes to include in browser monitoring. Allows * as wildcard at end. Custom events variables This section defines the Node.js agent variables in the order they typically appear in the custom_insights_events: { section of your app's newrelic.js configuration file. Currently there are no environment variables for custom events. enabled Type Boolean Default true When enabled, the agent sends custom events recorded with recordCustomEvent() to New Relic. If this is disabled, the agent does not collect this data or send it to New Relic. max_samples_stored Type Integer Default 1000 Environ variable NEW_RELIC_CUSTOM_INSIGHTS_EVENTS_MAX_SAMPLES_STORED Defines the maximum number of custom events the agent collects per minute. If the number of custom events exceeds this limit, the agent collects a statistical sampling. Important Increasing this limit increases memory usage. Slow queries variables This section defines the Node.js agent variables in the order they typically appear in the slow_sql: { section of your app's newrelic.js configuration file. These options control behavior for slow queries, but do not affect SQL nodes in transaction traces. enabled Type Boolean Default false Environ variable NEW_RELIC_SLOW_SQL_ENABLED When enabled, the agent collects slow query details. max_samples Type Integer Default 10 Environ variable NEW_RELIC_MAX_SQL_SAMPLES Defines the maximum number of slow queries the agent collects per minute. The agent discards additional queries after the limit is reached. Important Increasing this limit increases memory usage. Custom hostname variables This section defines the Node.js agent variables in the order they typically appear in the process_host: { section of your app's newrelic.js configuration file. These options control behavior regarding the host display name in the APM UI. display_name Type String of 255 bytes or less Default (none) Environ variable NEW_RELIC_PROCESS_HOST_DISPLAY_NAME Specify a custom hostname for display in New Relic. If you do not set this field, New Relic will continue to use the default hostname found by calling os.hostname(). If you use the default hostname settings, New Relic finds the hostname through os.hostname(). If this call fails, New Relic uses the host's IP as the name. If you set ipv_preference: 4 or ipv_preference: 6, you can select the type of IP address (IPv4 or IPv6) that appears in the New Relic UI. ipv_preference Type Integer (4 or 6) Default 4 Environ variable NEW_RELIC_IPV_PREFERENCE Environment variable overrides This section defines two configuration options only available with environment variables. These overrides are not used in most configurations. NEW_RELIC_HOME Path to the directory containing newrelic.js. This is available only as an environment variable. You cannot set it in your config file. Type String Default (none) NEW_RELIC_NO_CONFIG_FILE If used, this prevents the agent from reading configuration settings from newrelic.js. Default values and values from environment variables will still be set. This is available only as an environment variable. You cannot set it in your config file. Type Boolean Default False Datastore tracer variables This section defines the Node.js agent variables in the order they typically appear in the datastore_tracer section of your app's newrelic.js configuration file. These options control behavior for collecting datastore instance metrics. instance_reporting.enabled Type Boolean Default true When enabled, the agent collects datastore instance metrics (such as host and port) for some database drivers. These are reported on slow query traces and transaction traces. database_name_reporting.enabled Type Boolean Default true When enabled, the agent collects database name on slow query traces and transaction traces for some database drivers. Cross application tracing (DEPRECATED) The Node.js agent variables that control cross application tracing typically appear in the cross_application_tracer section of your app's newrelic.js configuration file: enabled Type Boolean Default false When set to true, allows tracing of transactions across more than one New Relic-monitored applications. Important Cross application tracing (CAT) has been deprecated and will be removed in a future major release. For cross-service visibility, we recommend using distributed tracing, which is enabled by default as of agent version 8.3.0. Before enabling, read the transition guide. Error message redaction variables The Node.js agent variables that control error message redaction appear in the allow_raw_exception_messages section of your app's newrelic.js configuration file: enabled Type Boolean Default true Environ variable NEW_RELIC_ALLOW_RAW_EXCEPTION_MESSAGES_ENABLED When false, the agent will redact the messages of captured errors. Distributed tracing Important Enabling distributed tracing disables cross application tracing, and has effects on other APM features. Before enabling, read the transition guide. Requires Node.js agent version 4.7.0 or higher. Distributed tracing lets you see the path that a request takes as it travels through a distributed system. When configuring via the config file, place the following option in the distributed_tracing section. enabled Type Boolean Default true Environ variable NEW_RELIC_DISTRIBUTED_TRACING_ENABLED Set this to true to enable distributed tracing. For example, to enable this in the config file, you would use: distributed_tracing: { enabled: true } Copy exclude_newrelic_header Type Boolean Default false Set this to true to exclude the New Relic header that is attached to outbound requests, and instead only rely on W3C Trace Context Headers for distributed tracing. If this is false then both types of headers are used. For example, to enable this in the config file, you would use: distributed_tracing:{ enabled: true, exclude_newrelic_header: true } Copy Span events Span data is reported for distributed tracing. Distributed tracing must be enabled to report spans. Span configuration is set in the span_events stanza. Options include: enabled Type Boolean Default true Environ variable NEW_RELIC_SPAN_EVENTS_ENABLED Turns reporting of span events on or off. attributes.enabled Type Boolean Default true Environ variable NEW_RELIC_SPAN_EVENTS_ATTRIBUTES_ENABLED This setting can be used to turn reporting of attributes on or off for spans. If attributes.enabled at the root level is false, no attributes will be sent with spans regardless on how this is set. attributes.include Type Array Default [] Environ variable NEW_RELIC_SPAN_EVENTS_ATTRIBUTES_INCLUDE If attributes are enabled for spans, all attribute keys found in this list will be attached to spans. For more information, see the agent attribute rules. attributes.exclude Type Array Default [] Environ variable NEW_RELIC_SPAN_EVENTS_ATTRIBUTES_EXCLUDE All attribute keys found in this list will not be sent with spans. For more information, see the agent attribute rules. max_samples_stored Type Integer Default 2000 Environ variable NEW_RELIC_SPAN_EVENTS_MAX_SAMPLES_STORED Defines the maximum number of events the agent collects per minute. If there are more than this number, the agent collects a statistical sampling. We do not recommend configuring past 10k. The server will cap data at 10k per-minute. Infinite Tracing To turn on Infinite Tracing, enable distributed tracing (set distributed_tracing to enabled: true) and add the additional settings below. For an example, see Language agents: configure distributed tracing. trace_observer.host Type String Default (none) Environ variable NEW_RELIC_INFINITE_TRACING_TRACE_OBSERVER_HOST For help getting a valid Infinite Tracing trace observer host entry, see Find or create a trace observer endpoint.",

      "body": "You can tailor the Node.js agent to your app's requirements by editing your newrelic.js config file or by setting an environment variable. The config file resides in the root directory of your app. You can also configure a few options from New Relic, or use the Node.js agent API. Important The license_key setting is required. We highly recommend setting the app_name so that your app has a meaningful name instead of the default My Application. Configuration methods and precedence The primary method to configure the Node.js agent is the agent configuration file (newrelic.js). You can also configure most settings with environment variables. You can also adjust some settings with server-side configuration. The Node.js agent uses this order of precedence for configuration methods: Node.js configuration hierarchy: Server-side configuration settings override environment variables. Environment variables override the agent config file. The config file overrides the agent defaults. Here are detailed descriptions of each configuration method: Agent configuration file The config file (newrelic.js) contains every Node.js agent setting. When you install the Node.js agent, you must copy newrelic.js into your app's root directory. Most settings are empty by default; they inherit their values from config/default.js. Environment variables Most configuration settings in newrelic.js have equivalent environment variables. These are useful, for example, if your agent runs in a PaaS environment such as Heroku or Microsoft Azure. Node.js agent environment variables always start with NEW_RELIC_. Where available, these environment variables are documented below under individual config options as the Environ variable. There are also two rarely used settings that can only be configured via environment variables. Server-side configuration Owners and Admins can view and configure a few settings directly in New Relic. Where available, the UI labels for server-side config are listed in this document under individual config options as the Server-side label. Exports variables This section defines the Node.js agent variables in the order they typically appear in the exports.config = { section of your app's newrelic.js configuration file. app_name (REQUIRED) Type String Default \"My Application\" Environ variable NEW_RELIC_APP_NAME The name New Relic uses to identify your app. For example, app_name: ['MyNodeApp']. To use multiple names for your app, specify a comma-delimited list of names. Data for all applications with the same name will be merged in the New Relic UI, so set this carefully. We highly recommend that you replace the default name with a descriptive name to avoid confusion and unintended aggregation of data. Tip For Azure users, the Node.js agent will use APP_POOL_ID if it is set, so you can use the name you chose for your Azure Web Server without setting it twice. license_key (REQUIRED) Type String Default (none) Environ variable NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY This setting is required. Your New Relic license key. For example, license_key: '40HexadecimalCharacters'. agent_enabled Type Boolean Default true Environ variable NEW_RELIC_ENABLED Set to false to stop the agent from starting up. This is useful when debugging your code requires temporarily disabling the agent. It prevents the agent from bootstrapping its instrumentation or setting up all its pieces, which prevents the agent from starting up and connecting to New Relic's servers. allow_all_headers If true, enables capture of all HTTP headers, except for those filtered by exclude rules. If false, collected headers are limited to those defined in Node.js agent attributes. Type Boolean Default false Caution Any header-related include/exclude rules must be in camelCase form to be filtered. apdex_t (DEPRECATED) Type Number Default 0.100 Server-side label Apdex T Set your Apdex T via the New Relic UI. certificates Type Array of strings Default (none) Additional certificates to trust for SSL connections, specified as an array of strings in PEM format. This affects both connections to an HTTPS proxy and connections to New Relic. Tip You can also configure the agent to read its certificates from a file: certificates: [ fs.readFileSync('myca.crt', {encoding: 'utf8'}) ] Copy high_security Type Boolean Default false Environ variable NEW_RELIC_HIGH_SECURITY When set to true, enables high security v2. You must also enable the ssl setting and enable high security in the UI. host Type String Default collector.newrelic.com Environ variable NEW_RELIC_HOST Important Do not edit this value unless New Relic Support asks you to change it. Hostname for the New Relic collector to connect to the Internet; for example, host: 'collector.newrelic.com'. labels Adds tags. Specify your tags as objects or a semicolon-delimited string of colon-separated pairs (for example, Server:One;Data Center:Primary). Type Object or string Default (none) Environ variable NEW_RELIC_LABELS port Type Integer Default 443 Environ variable NEW_RELIC_PORT Important Do not edit this value unless New Relic Support asks you to change it. Port number to connect to the New Relic collector; for example, port: 443. proxy Type String Default (none) Environ variable NEW_RELIC_PROXY_URL A URL specifying the proxy server to connect to the Internet. For example, proxy: 'http://user:pass@10.0.0.1:8000/'. Important The proxy config file setting overrides the other config file proxy settings (proxy_host, proxy_port, proxy_user, proxy_pass) if used. Similarly, the NEW_RELIC_PROXY_URL environment variable overrides the other environment variable proxy settings (NEW_RELIC_PROXY_HOST, NEW_RELIC_PROXY_PORT, NEW_RELIC_PROXY_USER, and NEW_RELIC_PROXY_PASS) if used. proxy_host Type String Default (none) Environ variable NEW_RELIC_PROXY_HOST Hostname or IP address of the proxy server to connect to the Internet. proxy_pass Type String Default (none) Environ variable NEW_RELIC_PROXY_PASS Password for authenticating to the proxy server. The agent supports only basic HTTP authentication. proxy_port Type String Default (none) Environ variable NEW_RELIC_PROXY_PORT Port number of the proxy server to connect to the Internet. proxy_user Type String Default (none) Environ variable NEW_RELIC_PROXY_USER User name for authenticating to the proxy server. The agent supports only basic HTTP authentication. Logging variables This section defines the Node.js agent variables in the order they typically appear in the logging: { section of your app's newrelic.js configuration file. enabled Type String Default true (false in serverless_mode) Environ variable NEW_RELIC_LOG_ENABLED Enables or disables agent specific logging. level Type String Default info Environ variable NEW_RELIC_LOG_LEVEL Defines the level of detail recorded in the agent logs. From least detail to most detail, possible values are fatal, error, warn, info, debug, or trace. Caution Do not use debug or trace logging unless New Relic Support asks you to use them. These levels of logging can generate excessive overhead. For most situations, use info. filepath Type String Default process.cwd() plus newrelic_agent.log Environ variable NEW_RELIC_LOG Complete path to the New Relic agent log, including the filename. Defaults to filepath: require('path').join(process.cwd(), 'newrelic_agent.log'). The agent will shut down the process if it cannot create this file. The agent creates a log file with the same permissions as the parent Node.js agent process. To write all logging to stdout, set this to stdout. To write all logging to stderr, set this to stderr. Audit logging This section defines the Node.js agent variables in the order they typically appear in the audit_log: { section of your app's newrelic.js configuration file. enabled Type Boolean Default false Environ variable NEW_RELIC_AUDIT_LOG_ENABLED When enabled, the agent logs the payloads it sends to the collector. This data is included in the main log file even when logging level is set to the lowest level. endpoints Type Array Default Empty array (include all types) Environ variable NEW_RELIC_AUDIT_LOG_ENDPOINTS The agent sends several different types of data to the collector in separate payloads. By default, all of them are included in the log file. This option makes it possible to limit logging only to specific types of data. Valid values include: agent_settings analytic_event_data connect custom_event_data error_data error_event_data metric_data preconnect shutdown span_event_data sql_trace_data transaction_sample_data API configuration This section allows you to choose which API methods are enabled. Each configuration option allows you to modularly enable API methods that are responsible for sending custom information to New Relic. Important All of these are set to false when the agent is in high security mode. custom_attributes_enabled Type Boolean Default true Environ variable NEW_RELIC_API_CUSTOM_ATTRIBUTES This option enables newrelic.addCustomAttribute and newrelic.addCustomAttributes. custom_events_enabled Type Boolean Default true Environ variable NEW_RELIC_API_CUSTOM_EVENTS This option enables recordCustomEvent. notice_error_enabled Type Boolean Default true Environ variable NEW_RELIC_API_NOTICE_ERROR This option enables newrelic.noticeError. Attributes This section defines the variables for Node.js agent attributes in the order they typically appear in the attributes: { section of your app's newrelic.js configuration file. Caution Any header-related include/exclude rules must be in camelCase form to be filtered. enabled Type Boolean Default true Environ variable NEW_RELIC_ATTRIBUTES_ENABLED If true, enables capture of attributes for all destinations. exclude Type Array Default [] Environ variable NEW_RELIC_ATTRIBUTES_EXCLUDE Prefix of attributes to exclude from all destinations. Allows * as wildcard at end. include Type Array Default [] Environ variable NEW_RELIC_ATTRIBUTES_INCLUDE Prefix of attributes to include from all destinations. Allows * as wildcard at end. include_enabled Type Boolean Default true Environ variable NEW_RELIC_ATTRIBUTES_INCLUDE_ENABLED When true, patterns may be added to the attributes.include list. Error collector variables You can manage how error are handled in New Relic. This section defines the Node.js agent variables in the order they typically appear in the error_collector: { section of your app's newrelic.js configuration file. enabled Type Boolean Default true Environ variable NEW_RELIC_ERROR_COLLECTOR_ENABLED Server-side label Enable error collection? When enabled, the agent collects error traces from your app. ignore_status_codes Type Array Default 404 Environ variable NEW_RELIC_ERROR_COLLECTOR_IGNORE_ERROR_CODES Server-side label Ignore these status codes Comma-delimited list of HTTP status codes for the error collector to ignore. Caution Errors recorded using newrelic.noticeError do not obey this configuration value. ignore_classes Type Array|Object Default [] Environ variable NEW_RELIC_ERROR_COLLECTOR_IGNORE_ERRORS Comma-delimited list of javascript error types/classes for the error collector to ignore. The following configuration /* ... */ error_collector: { ignore_classes: [\"ReferenceError\"] } /* ... */ Copy Would ignore all reference errors.

The following configuration. /* ... */ error_collector: { /* ... */ ignore_messages: {\"Error\":[\"Undefined\", \"Out of time\"]} /* ... */ } /* ... */ Copy Would ignore all errors of type Error, with the exact (case-sensitive) message strings of Undefined and Out of time. Caution Errors recorded using newrelic.noticeError do not obey this configuration value. expected_status_codes Type Array Default [] Environ variable NEW_RELIC_ERROR_COLLECTOR_EXPECTED_ERROR_CODES Comma-delimited list of HTTP status codes for the error collector to mark as expected. Caution Errors recorded using newrelic.noticeError do not obey this configuration value. expected_classes Type Array Default [] Environ variable NEW_RELIC_ERROR_COLLECTOR_EXPECTED_ERRORS The following configuration /* ... */ error_collector: { expected_classes: [\"ReferenceError\"] } /* ... */ Copy Would mark all reference errors as expected. Caution Errors recorded using newrelic.noticeError do not obey this configuration value. expected_messages Type Object Default {} A javascript object describing a list of javascript classes tied to javascript error messages for the collector to ignore. The following configuration. /* ... */ error_collector: { /* ... */ expected_messages: {\"Error\":[\"Undefined\", \"Out of time\"]} /* ... */ } /* ... */ Copy Would mark all errors of type Error, with the exact (case-sensitive) message strings of Undefined and Out of time. Caution Errors recorded using newrelic.noticeError do not obey this configuration value. attributes.enabled Type Boolean Default true Environ variable NEW_RELIC_ERROR_COLLECTOR_ATTRIBUTES_ENABLED If true, the agent captures attributes from error collection. Caution Any header-related include/exclude rules must be in camelCase form to be filtered. attributes.exclude Type Array Default [] Environ variable NEW_RELIC_ERROR_COLLECTOR_ATTRIBUTES_EXCLUDE Prefix of attributes to exclude from error collection. Allows * as wildcard at end. attributes.include Type Array Default [] Environ variable NEW_RELIC_ERROR_COLLECTOR_ATTRIBUTES_INCLUDE Prefix of attributes to include in error collection. Allows * as wildcard at end. max_event_samples_stored Type Integer Default 100 Environ variable NEW_RELIC_ERROR_COLLECTOR_MAX_EVENT_SAMPLES_STORED Defines the maximum number of events the agent collects per minute. If there are more than this number, the agent collects a statistical sampling. Transaction tracer variables The agent groups your requests into transactions, which are used to: Visualize where your app spends its time (in transaction breakdowns). Identify slow requests. Group metrics. Isolate other issues, such as slow database performance. This section defines the Node.js agent variables in the order they typically appear in the transaction_tracer: { section of your app's newrelic.js configuration file. Important Do not use brackets [suffix] at the end of your transaction name. New Relic automatically strips brackets from the name. Instead, use parentheses (suffix) or other symbols if needed. enabled Type Boolean Default true Environ variable NEW_RELIC_TRACER_ENABLED Server-side label Enable transaction tracing? When enabled, the agent collects slow transaction traces. explain_threshold Type Integer Default 500 Environ variable NEW_RELIC_EXPLAIN_THRESHOLD Minimum query duration (in milliseconds) for a transaction to be eligible for slow queries in transaction traces. record_sql Type String (off, obfuscated, or raw) Default off Environ variable NEW_RELIC_RECORD_SQL This option affects both slow queries and record_sql for transaction traces. It can have one of three values: off, obfuscated, or raw. When set to off no slow queries will be captured, and backtraces and SQL will not be included in transaction traces. If set to raw or obfuscated, the agent sends raw or obfuscated SQL and a slow query sample to the collector. The agent may also send SQL when other criteria are met, such as when slow_sql.enabled is set. top_n Type Integer Default 20 Environ variable NEW_RELIC_TRACER_TOP_N Defines the maximum number of requests eligible for transaction traces. Transactions are named based on the request, and top_n refers to the \"top n slowest transactions\" grouped by these names. The module replaces a recorded trace with a new trace only if the new trace is slower than the previous slowest trace of that name. The default value for this setting is top_n: 20, because the Transactions page also defaults to the 20 slowest transactions. The Node.js agent captures at least five different slow transactions in the first harvest cycle after start up. It will also reset and capture different transactions if no slow transactions have been captured for the last five harvest cycles. This allows you to see more information about more of your app's request paths, at the possible cost of not focusing on the absolutely slowest request for that harvest cycle. Tip To record the absolute slowest transaction over the last minute, you can set top_n: 0 or top_n: 1. However, this causes one very slow route to dominate your transaction traces. transaction_threshold Type Integer or apdex_f Default apdex_f Environ variable NEW_RELIC_TRACER_THRESHOLD Server-side label Threshold Threshold of web transaction response time in seconds beyond which a transaction is eligible for transaction tracing. The default value is apdex_f; this sets the trace threshold to four times your application's Apdex T. You can also enter a specific time value in milliseconds. Example: Threshold set to apdex_f The default apdex_t is 100 milliseconds. If your transaction threshold is set to apdex_f, a \"slow\" transaction is 400 milliseconds. hide_internals Type boolean Default true Environ variable NEW_RELIC_HIDE_INTERNALS The agent uses a small amount of CPU in order to hide internal properties that are attached to the web application. If you change this configuration to false, it may slightly decrease your agent overhead, but it could also have an impact on the performance of the agent. attributes.enabled Type Boolean Default true Environ variable NEW_RELIC_TRANSACTION_TRACER_ATTRIBUTES_ENABLED If true, the agent captures attributes from transaction traces. Caution Any header-related include/exclude rules must be in camelCase form to be filtered. attributes.exclude Type Array Default [] Environ variable NEW_RELIC_TRANSACTION_TRACER_ATTRIBUTES_EXCLUDE Prefix of attributes to exclude from transaction traces. Allows * as wildcard at end. attributes.include Type Array Default [] Environ variable NEW_RELIC_TRANSACTION_TRACER_ATTRIBUTES_INCLUDE Prefix of attributes to include in transaction traces. Allows * as wildcard at end. Rules variables This section defines the Node.js agent variables in the order they typically appear in the rules: { section of your app's newrelic.js configuration file. name Type Strings or regular expressions Default (none) Environ variable NEW_RELIC_NAMING_RULES A comma-delimited list of rules to match incoming request URLs and name the associated New Relic transaction. Uses the format: name: [ {pattern: 'STRING_OR_REGEX', name: 'NAME'}, {pattern: 'STRING_OR_REGEX', name: 'NAME'} ], Copy Both parameters are required. For strings, you must escape control characters. You do not need to escape control characters in regular expressions. Additional attributes are ignored. Regular expressions support JavaScript-style capture groups, and names use $1-style replacement strings. Regular expressions only find the first matching result; subsequent matches are ignored. For more information, see Node.js transaction naming API. For the NEW_RELIC_NAMING_RULES environment variable, pass the rules as comma-delimited JSON object literals: NEW_RELIC_NAMING_RULES='{\"pattern\":\"^t\",\"name\":\"u\"},{\"pattern\":\"^u\",\"name\":\"t\"}' Copy ignore Type Strings or regular expressions Default Regular expression to match socket.io long-polling requests (\"^ \\ /socket \\ .io \\ /. * \\ /xhr-polling/\"). Environ variable NEW_RELIC_IGNORING_RULES Define a list of request URLs you want the agent to ignore. Specify the list as patterns, which can be strings or regular expressions. enforce_backstop Type Boolean Default true Environ variable NEW_RELIC_ENFORCE_BACKSTOP Caution Do not change this setting unless you understand metric grouping issues. When enabled, the agent renames transactions that are not affected by other naming logic (such as the API, rules, or metric normalization rules) to NormalizedUri/*. If you set this to false, the agent sets transaction names to Uri/path/to/resource. Transaction events variables This section defines the Node.js agent variables in the order they typically appear in the transaction_events: { section of your app's newrelic.js configuration file. enabled Type Boolean Default true When enabled, the agent sends transaction events to New Relic. This event data includes transaction timing, transaction name, and any custom parameters. If this is disabled, the agent does not collect this data or send it to New Relic. max_samples_stored Type Integer Default 10000 Environ variable NEW_RELIC_TRANSACTION_EVENTS_MAX_SAMPLES_STORED Defines the maximum number of events the agent collects per minute. If there are more than this number, the agent collects a statistical sampling. We do not recommend configuring past 10,000. The server will cap data at 10,000 per-minute. Important This configuration had different behavior in agent versions lower than 6.0.0. See max_samples_stored (DEPRECATED) for agent versions 5.x or lower. max_samples_stored (DEPRECATED) Type Integer Default 20000 Defines the maximum number of events the agent stores if it is unable to communicate with the New Relic collector. The values from the previous harvest cycle will be merged into the next one, with this option limiting the maximum number. Make sure this number is greater than max_samples_per_minute; for example, set it to twice as much. Consider your memory overhead before increasing this value. Caution This configuration has different behavior starting with agent version 6.0.0 and a new recommended maximum. See max_samples_stored for agent versions 6.x or higher. max_samples_per_minute (DEPRECATED) Type Integer Default 10000 Defines the maximum number of events the agent collects per minute. If there are more than this number, the agent collects a statistical sampling. Caution This configuration has been replaced with max_samples_stored starting with version 6.0.0 of the agent. See max_samples_stored for 6.x or later agents. attributes.enabled Type Boolean Default true Environ variable NEW_RELIC_TRANSACTION_EVENTS_ATTRIBUTES_ENABLED If true, the agent captures attributes from transaction events. Caution Any header-related include/exclude rules must be in camelCase form to be filtered. attributes.exclude Type Array Default [] Environ variable NEW_RELIC_TRANSACTION_EVENTS_ATTRIBUTES_EXCLUDE Prefix of attributes to exclude from transaction events. Allows * as wildcard at end. attributes.include Type Array Default [] Environ variable NEW_RELIC_TRANSACTION_EVENTS_ATTRIBUTES_INCLUDE Prefix of attributes to include in transaction events. Allows * as wildcard at end. Browser monitoring variables This section defines the Node.js agent variables in the order they typically appear in the browser_monitoring: { section of your app's newrelic.js configuration file. enable Type Boolean Default true Environ variable NEW_RELIC_BROWSER_MONITOR_ENABLE Server-side label Enable browser monitoring? Generate JavaScript headers for browser instrumentation. Although this defaults to true, the agent doesn't inject the browser JS code unless you have enabled browser monitoring. Even if you have enabled it and added the browser timing header, you can disable browser monitoring for your app by setting this to false. debug Type Boolean Default false Environ variable NEW_RELIC_BROWSER_MONITOR_DEBUG If true, request un-minified sources from the server. attributes.enabled Type Boolean Default false Environ variable NEW_RELIC_BROWSER_MONITORING_ATTRIBUTES_ENABLED If true, the agent sends custom attributes to browser monitoring. Caution Any header-related include/exclude rules must be in camelCase form to be filtered. attributes.exclude Type Array Default [] Environ variable NEW_RELIC_BROWSER_MONITORING_ATTRIBUTES_EXCLUDE Prefix of attributes to exclude from browser monitoring. Allows * as wildcard at end. attributes.include Type Array Default [] Environ variable NEW_RELIC_BROWSER_MONITORING_ATTRIBUTES_INCLUDE Prefix of attributes to include in browser monitoring. Allows * as wildcard at end. Custom events variables This section defines the Node.js agent variables in the order they typically appear in the custom_insights_events: { section of your app's newrelic.js configuration file. Currently there are no environment variables for custom events. enabled Type Boolean Default true When enabled, the agent sends custom events recorded with recordCustomEvent() to New Relic. If this is disabled, the agent does not collect this data or send it to New Relic. max_samples_stored Type Integer Default 1000 Environ variable NEW_RELIC_CUSTOM_INSIGHTS_EVENTS_MAX_SAMPLES_STORED Defines the maximum number of custom events the agent collects per minute. If the number of custom events exceeds this limit, the agent collects a statistical sampling. Important Increasing this limit increases memory usage. Slow queries variables This section defines the Node.js agent variables in the order they typically appear in the slow_sql: { section of your app's newrelic.js configuration file. These options control behavior for slow queries, but do not affect SQL nodes in transaction traces. enabled Type Boolean Default false Environ variable NEW_RELIC_SLOW_SQL_ENABLED When enabled, the agent collects slow query details. max_samples Type Integer Default 10 Environ variable NEW_RELIC_MAX_SQL_SAMPLES Defines the maximum number of slow queries the agent collects per minute. The agent discards additional queries after the limit is reached. Important Increasing this limit increases memory usage. Custom hostname variables This section defines the Node.js agent variables in the order they typically appear in the process_host: { section of your app's newrelic.js configuration file. These options control behavior regarding the host display name in the APM UI. display_name Type String of 255 bytes or less Default (none) Environ variable NEW_RELIC_PROCESS_HOST_DISPLAY_NAME Specify a custom hostname for display in New Relic. If you do not set this field, New Relic will continue to use the default hostname found by calling os.hostname(). If you use the default hostname settings, New Relic finds the hostname through os.hostname(). If this call fails, New Relic uses the host's IP as the name. If you set ipv_preference: 4 or ipv_preference: 6, you can select the type of IP address (IPv4 or IPv6) that appears in the New Relic UI. ipv_preference Type Integer (4 or 6) Default 4 Environ variable NEW_RELIC_IPV_PREFERENCE Environment variable overrides This section defines two configuration options only available with environment variables. These overrides are not used in most configurations. NEW_RELIC_HOME Path to the directory containing newrelic.js. This is available only as an environment variable. You cannot set it in your config file. Type String Default (none) NEW_RELIC_NO_CONFIG_FILE If used, this prevents the agent from reading configuration settings from newrelic.js. Default values and values from environment variables will still be set. This is available only as an environment variable. You cannot set it in your config file. Type Boolean Default False Datastore tracer variables This section defines the Node.js agent variables in the order they typically appear in the datastore_tracer section of your app's newrelic.js configuration file. These options control behavior for collecting datastore instance metrics. instance_reporting.enabled Type Boolean Default true When enabled, the agent collects datastore instance metrics (such as host and port) for some database drivers. These are reported on slow query traces and transaction traces. database_name_reporting.enabled Type Boolean Default true When enabled, the agent collects database name on slow query traces and transaction traces for some database drivers. Cross application tracing (DEPRECATED) The Node.js agent variables that control cross application tracing typically appear in the cross_application_tracer section of your app's newrelic.js configuration file: enabled Type Boolean Default false When set to true, allows tracing of transactions across more than one New Relic-monitored applications. Important Cross application tracing (CAT) has been deprecated and will be removed in a future major release. For cross-service visibility, we recommend using distributed tracing, which is enabled by default as of agent version 8.3.0. Before enabling, read the transition guide. Error message redaction variables The Node.js agent variables that control error message redaction appear in the allow_raw_exception_messages section of your app's newrelic.js configuration file: enabled Type Boolean Default true Environ variable NEW_RELIC_ALLOW_RAW_EXCEPTION_MESSAGES_ENABLED When false, the agent will redact the messages of captured errors. Distributed tracing Important Enabling distributed tracing disables cross application tracing, and has effects on other APM features. Before enabling, read the transition guide. Requires Node.js agent version 4.7.0 or higher. Distributed tracing lets you see the path that a request takes as it travels through a distributed system. When configuring via the config file, place the following option in the distributed_tracing section. enabled Type Boolean Default true Environ variable NEW_RELIC_DISTRIBUTED_TRACING_ENABLED Set this to true to enable distributed tracing. For example, to enable this in the config file, you would use: distributed_tracing: { enabled: true } Copy exclude_newrelic_header Type Boolean Default false Set this to true to exclude the New Relic header that is attached to outbound requests, and instead only rely on W3C Trace Context Headers for distributed tracing. If this is false then both types of headers are used. For example, to enable this in the config file, you would use: distributed_tracing:{ enabled: true, exclude_newrelic_header: true } Copy Span events Span data is reported for distributed tracing. Distributed tracing must be enabled to report spans. Span configuration is set in the span_events stanza. Options include: enabled Type Boolean Default true Environ variable NEW_RELIC_SPAN_EVENTS_ENABLED Turns reporting of span events on or off. attributes.enabled Type Boolean Default true Environ variable NEW_RELIC_SPAN_EVENTS_ATTRIBUTES_ENABLED This setting can be used to turn reporting of attributes on or off for spans. If attributes.enabled at the root level is false, no attributes will be sent with spans regardless on how this is set. attributes.include Type Array Default [] Environ variable NEW_RELIC_SPAN_EVENTS_ATTRIBUTES_INCLUDE If attributes are enabled for spans, all attribute keys found in this list will be attached to spans. For more information, see the agent attribute rules. attributes.exclude Type Array Default [] Environ variable NEW_RELIC_SPAN_EVENTS_ATTRIBUTES_EXCLUDE All attribute keys found in this list will not be sent with spans. For more information, see the agent attribute rules. max_samples_stored Type Integer Default 2000 Environ variable NEW_RELIC_SPAN_EVENTS_MAX_SAMPLES_STORED Defines the maximum number of events the agent collects per minute. If there are more than this number, the agent collects a statistical sampling. We do not recommend configuring past 10k. The server will cap data at 10k per-minute. Infinite Tracing To turn on Infinite Tracing, enable distributed tracing (set distributed_tracing to enabled: true) and add the additional settings below. For an example, see Language agents: configure distributed tracing. trace_observer.host Type String Default (none) Environ variable NEW_RELIC_INFINITE_TRACING_TRACE_OBSERVER_HOST For help getting a valid Infinite Tracing trace observer host entry, see Find or create a trace observer endpoint.",

      "body": "Follow the appropriate procedure to rename your browser app depending on the deployment option you used to add it to browser. Rename app monitored by APM If you added an app to browser already being monitored by APM, the app name that appears in browser is the same as the app name in the APM UI. To rename the app, use any of these options: Option Comments Rename and continue collecting data This option is useful when you simply want to give an app a different display name (alias). To change the alias that appears in the New Relic UI, use the app's Settings page: Go to one.newrelic.com > APM > (select an app) > Settings > Application. Stop reporting under the old name To stop reporting data under the old name and begin collecting data with a new name (app identifer), use the APM agent's configuration file. This changes the identifier that New Relic's data collector uses to distinguish one app from another. Based on the data retention schedule, New Relic will retain historical data collected under the old name, and will collect and aggregate data under the new name. If one or more apps share the same name, then their data will be aggregated in the UI. Caution If you change the app identifier, a new application will appear in our user interface with the new name, and data will stop reporting to the app(s) with the old name. Rename app via JavaScript snippet This information applies if you inserted the browser agent's JavaScript snippet into your: App monitored by APM that was deployed via the copy/paste method Single page app (SPA) Any standalone browser app that is not also monitored by APM You cannot directly edit the JavaScript snippet in the existing app. Instead, to use your app with a different name: Follow standard procedures to create a new app using the copy/paste method. Provide the new name, and generate the JavaScript snippet. Copy the new JavaScript snippet. In your webpage, replace the JavaScript from your original app with the JavaScript generated for the new app name. If your standalone app has multiple names, copy the custom app IDs in your configuration script to your new app. Based on the data retention schedule, New Relic will retain historical data collected under the old name, and will collect and aggregate data under the new name. Rename app via New Relic REST API (v2) This information applies only to browser apps that are also monitored by APM. You cannot change the app name via the REST API if you used the copy/paste method to insert browser's JavaScript snippet into your app. Follow standard procedures to change the APM app alias via REST API or API Explorer.

      "body": "Browser monitoring includes strict security measures to provide a robust, standalone product with browser monitoring features. Before you install the browser agent, make sure your system meets these requirements. Want to try out our browser monitoring? Create a New Relic account for free! No credit card required. Basic requirements To report data to browser, your application must at a minimum meet two basic requirements: The traffic to the application must be from clients able to load and execute browser JavaScript code and set cookies. Clients accessing the application must be able to send data to New Relic through HTTP requests. HTTPS is required for browser Pro features. Important Browsers that subscribe to a disconnect list or that use content filtering extensions such as AdBlock may not be able to send data to New Relic. For example, if you are using the Enhanced Tracking Prevention disconnect list for Mozilla Firefox 69.0 or higher, you will need to change the default configuration. Most typical browser applications meet these requirements. However, browser applications in restricted environments may have difficulty reporting data to New Relic; for example: Hybrid mobile applications Applications installed on unusual hardware, such as point-of-sale terminals or consumer appliances For more information, review the instrumentation for browser monitoring documentation, and verify end-user network access. Browser types Instrumentation is compatible with every browser type, including Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox, Microsoft Internet Explorer and Edge, and Apple Safari. The user interface is compatible with New Relic's supported browser versions. Exceptions Comments Paint timings The firstPaint and firstContentfulPaint attributes in BrowserInteraction, PageView, and PageViewTiming events are only compatible with: Chrome 60 or higher for desktop and mobile (Android webview and Chrome for Android) Opera 47 or higher for desktop Opera 44 or higher for Android mobile Samsung Internet for mobile AJAX AJAX timing features are not available with: Chrome for iPhone and iPad IE 7 and 8 PageAction events PageAction events require a browser that fully supports cross-domain XMLHttpRequests. Internet Explorer versions 9 and lower cannot record PageAction events. Learn more on querying your data. Session traces Session traces are reported only from browsers that support the Resource Timing Specification. SHA-256 New Relic can only monitor browsers that are compatible with SHA-256. APM agents You can deploy the browser agent for apps monitored by APM, or you can deploy the browser agent for your standalone apps. For more information, see the installation procedures. If you are deploying browser for an app using APM, make sure your agent supports browser monitoring: C SDK: Version 1.0.0 or higher Go: Version 2.5.0 or higher Java: Version 3.4.0 or higher .NET: Version 2.20.25.0 or higher Node.js: Version 1.4.0 or higher PHP: Version 4.4.5.35 or higher Python: Version 2.10.1.9 or higher Ruby: Version 3.7.0.177 or higher Supported frameworks The browser agent collects data on all front-end frameworks. However, the monitoring occurs on lower-level \"primitives\" that JavaScript frameworks use, so the level of detail collected by the instrumentation may vary depending on your specific framework. Exceptions Comments Zone.js If you're using AngularJS and you want to use our SPA monitoring features, note that Zone.js versions 0.6.18 to 0.6.24 are not compatible with browser. In all cases, the browser agent must be loaded before Zone.js to avoid errors. Cypress.io Browser is unable to properly instrument the open and send methods of requests when tests are run in Cypress. This will cause the following error to be thrown: Cannot set property 'status' of undefined Copy This will only affect customers running tests with the Browser agent present in their code. Production applications should not be affected. html2pdf.js This library is not compatible with our Pro+SPA agent due to the way this library wraps promises. If you're using this library, we recommend selecting the Pro agent type. Content Security Policy (CSP) considerations In order to obtain accurate browser performance metrics, browser requires the use of a small, inline JavaScript snippet. New Relic carefully reviews the inline JavaScript to prevent Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) and other potential vulnerabilities. Content Security Policy Level 2 adds restrictions to the types of JavaScript allowed, such as inline scripts. It also limits which domains can load scripts during page load. Important If your website does not allow any third-party hosted JavaScript to run, you must request a CSP exception via your organization’s standard procedures in order to install the browser monitoring agent. When requesting a CSP exception, follow your organization's standard procedures to contact your web or security team. The browser JavaScript agent requires the following CSP exceptions in order to run properly. Alternatively, you can add all of these exceptions to the fallback default-src directive (instead of script-src and connect-src). CSP exception Comments unsafe-inline Add to the script-src directive or to the fallback default-src directive. This is required because the agent is installed by including an inline script. https://js-agent.newrelic.com Add to the script-src directive or to the fallback default-src directive. This is where additional script files that the agent requires are hosted. https://bam.nr-data.net https://bam-cell.nr-data.net Important Add https://gov-bam.nr-data.net if you're using FedRAMP-compliant endpoints. Add to the script-src directive or to the fallback default-src directive. This is where the agent sends its collected data. One of the calls to this URL is a JSONP call, which means that the URL must be allowed as a script source. Add to the connect-src directive or to the fallback default-src directive. The connect-src directive affects the URLs that scripts can call (for example, using the XMLHttpRequest interface). If you have CSP restrictions specifically around this directive, then add this URL as an exception.",

      "body": "Your end-user experience depends on your entire technology stack. You need to quickly understand what's causing a customer complaint or issue. Did the problem come from your infrastructure, your application, or the browsers that ultimately render it? Is it the result of a problematic internet provider, a problem in your own data center with failing CPU or memory, or something else? More than Real User Monitoring (RUM) Many websites contain dynamic content that is loaded after the initial page has finished loading, and complex JavaScript code increases the need for error reporting. Browser monitoring in New Relic One provides a Real User Monitoring (RUM) solution that measures the speed and performance of your end users as they navigate to your site from different web browsers, devices, operating systems, and networks. With browser monitoring in New Relic One, you see actionable data about your end users' experience with your app. But browser monitoring in New Relic goes far beyond the initial page load to measure full page life cycle data. For example, our browser UI shows you: Actual performance data, such as by page view popularity and user satisfaction (Apdex) scores Perceived performance data that measures how quickly your async or dynamic visuals and interactive page contents display JavaScript error analytics, stack traces, and line-of-code visibility, to show you the end-user steps leading up to an error itself Session performance with a detailed timeline and heat map of the load and interaction events during a webpage's full life cycle AJAX requests indicating problems with timing, end points, and specific locations in the webpage Hash-based route changes in apps with single-page application (SPA) architectures These tools (and more!) help your teams optimize your end users' page load experience, eliminate bugs, and troubleshoot faster across your full stack. Examine user perceptions Real user data gives insights into actual page performance, but you also need to look into your users' perception of your site's performance. Pages can load content in many different ways, and users control when they interact with that content. This is why some user-centric performance metrics happen outside the standard window onload (page load time) in the browser monitoring agent. The PageViewTiming event provides a more real-time delivery mechanism that does not have a dependency on any other event. Additional metrics include: First paint, first contentful paint, and largest contentful paint First input delay First interaction This helps you understand how users experience your site, both from visual and responsiveness standpoints. Improve interactive app performance Our single-page app (SPA) monitoring automatically tracks route changes, initial page loads, and synchronous and asynchronous activity during browser interactions. You can also use our browser agent and SPA API to monitor virtually anything that executes inside the browser. If you are a developer, SPA monitoring can help you: Create faster, more responsive, highly interactive apps. Monitor the throughput and performance that real users are experiencing. Troubleshoot and resolve problems within the context of the page load. Query and visualize the data to assist with business decisions. Bring better apps to the marketplace more quickly. Correlate front-end and back-end problems With New Relic One, you can instrument any type of data you need, such as metrics, events, logs, and traces. This helps you find actionable data about your end users' experience across the stack. For example: Full-Stack Observability Comments Locations or domains Limit browser monitoring to focus on specific geographical locations or specific types of end-user activity. You can also monitor or block specific domains. Trends in interactions Use our comparative charting feature for a direct page load time comparison between real user (browser) interactions and trends appearing in Synthetic monitors. Distributed tracing Isolate latency from the web browser through back-end services with distributed tracing. The UI helps you see the connection across across a full transaction, from browser activity, to time spent in network, to back-end activity. Browser types Explore your end users' experience with your app segmented by any types of browsers they use, including: Top browsers by throughput Average page load time by platform type (mobile, desktop, and other) Selected browser type by version (for example, Chrome 31, 32, 33, etc.) This helps you quickly determine whether problems with page load timing may be related to a specific browser type or platform, or whether the problem is more widespread. Get started with browser monitoring Follow these basic steps, and you'll quickly be up and running in New Relic with browser monitoring! Review the compatibility details and basic requirements for browser monitoring. Install the browser agent. Go to [one.newrelic.com > Explorer > Browser applications. Use the Explorer to access all your entities, that is, anything we can identify that reports data, from applications and hosts to custom groupings of any elements. View summary data from your Browser summary page, then drill down into page load timing details and other UI data. Configure your alerts for key performance data, or use our Applied Intelligence solutions to reduce alert noise, correlate incidents, and automatically detect anomalies.

      "body": "New Relic's .NET agent supports both .NET Framework and .NET Core. This document describes compatibility and support for .NET Core applications. See Compatibility and requirements for .NET Framework for .NET Framework applications. New Relic's .NET agent includes built-in instrumentation for some of the most popular parts of the .NET Core ecosystem, including frameworks, databases, and message queuing systems. After installation, the agent runs within the monitored process; there is not a separate process or service created by the agent. For frameworks and libraries that are not automatically instrumented out of the box, you can extend the agent with .NET custom instrumentation. Want to try out our .NET agent? Create a New Relic account for free! No credit card required. Requirements Before you install the New Relic .NET agent on Windows or Linux, make sure your system meets these requirements: Microsoft .NET Core version The .NET agent supports .NET Core versions 2.0, 2.1, 2.2, 3.0, 3.1, and .NET 5.0. Table of minimum agent versions required per .NET Core version .NET Core Version Minimum Required .NET Agent Version .NET Core 2.0 > = 8.19.353.0 .NET Core 2.1 > = 8.19.353.0 .NET Core 2.2 > = 8.19.353.0 .NET Core 3.0 > = 8.21.34.0 .NET Core 3.1 > = 8.21.34.0 .NET 5.0 > = 8.35.0 The agent is not compatible with .NET Core versions 1.0 or 1.1. For .NET Core 2.1 or higher applications with tiered compilation enabled, the agent will disable tiered compilation. .NET Core 2.1 support requires .NET Core runtime 2.1.3 and .NET Core SDK 2.1.401 or higher due to a bug in the .NET Core profiling API. Target framework version The .NET agent only supports applications targeting .NET Core 2.0, 2.1, 2.2, 3.0, 3.1, and NET 5.0. You can find the target framework in your .csproj file: Supported: <TargetFramework>netcoreapp2.0</TargetFramework> Copy <TargetFramework>netcoreapp2.1</TargetFramework> Copy <TargetFramework>netcoreapp2.2</TargetFramework> Copy <TargetFramework>netcoreapp3.0</TargetFramework> Copy <TargetFramework>netcoreapp3.1</TargetFramework> Copy <TargetFramework>net5.0</TargetFramework> Copy Unsupported: <TargetFramework>net452</TargetFramework> Copy Important If you want to monitor an ASP.NET Core application targeting .NET Framework, ensure your install of the .NET agent has .NET Framework support enabled. App/web servers Ensure you use one of these app/web servers: Kestrel Kestrel with IIS reverse proxy via AspNetCoreModule Kestrel with IIS reverse proxy via AspNetCoreModuleV2 Kestrel with Nginx reverse proxy Kestrel with Apache reverse proxy Operating system The agent has been verified to work with the following operating systems: Operating system Supported versions Windows (32- and 64-bit Intel compatible architectures) Server 2008 R2 SP1 Server 2012 Server 2012 R2 Server 2016 Server 2019 Windows containers running on Server 2016 (NanoServer based images are not supported) Linux (64-bit Intel compatible only) All x64 Linux distributions supported by the .NET Core 2.0+/.NET 5 runtime are supported by the .NET agent. For a full list, refer to Microsoft's documentation for the version of the runtime you are using. Microsoft Azure For Azure-specific installation instructions, see: Install on Azure Cloud Services Install on Azure Service Fabric Install on Azure Web Apps Processor architectures The agent is available in both 32-bit (x86) and 64-bit (x64) versions on Windows as well as 64-bit (x64) on Linux. Permissions Installing and running the .NET agent requires these permissions: Component Necessary permissions Install the agent The process or user that installs the agent must have sufficient permissions to set environment variables and write access to the directory where the agent is installed. Run the agent The monitored process must have read/write access to the directory in which you installed the agent. The agent runs as a part of the monitored process and relies on those permissions to function. For applications using IIS via reverse proxy, the group IIS_IUSRS is often used. Security requirements As a standard security measure for data collection, your app server must support SHA-2 (256-bit). SHA-1 is not supported. Network requirements The agent requires your firewall to allow outgoing connections to specific networks and ports. Automatic instrumentation If your application is hosted in ASP.NET Core, the agent automatically creates and instruments transactions. The .NET agent will automatically instrument your application after install. If your app is not automatically instrumented, or if you want to add instrumentation, use custom instrumentation. App frameworks The .NET agent automatically instruments these application frameworks: ASP.NET Core MVC 2.0, 2.1, 2.2, 3.0, 3.1, and 5.0 (includes Web API) Datastores The .NET agent automatically instruments the performance of .NET application calls to these datastores: Datastore Instance details Notes Microsoft SQL Server Use System.Data.SqlClient version 4.3.1 or Microsoft.Data.SqlClient. PostgresSQL Use Npgsql 4.0. Prior versions of Npgsql may also be instrumented, but duplicate and/or missing metrics are possible. MongoDB Use driver version 2.3.x, 2.4.x, 2.5.x, or 2.6.x. Driver version 2.7.x: The .NET agent does not support API methods introduced by driver version 2.7.x, but does support pre-existing methods from previous versions. MySQL Use MySql.Data version 6.10.4 or later, or use the MySQL Connector StackExchange.Redis The .NET agent does not directly monitor datastore processes. Also, the .NET SQL parameter capture in a query trace does not list parameters for a parameterized query or a stored procedure. Collecting instance details for supported datastores is enabled by default. To request instance-level information from datastores not currently listed, get support at support.newrelic.com. External call libraries The .NET agent automatically instruments these external call libraries : Libraries Supported methods HttpClient The agent instruments these HttpClient methods: SendAsync GetAsync PostAsync PutAsync DeleteAsync GetStringAsync GetStreamAsync GetByteArrayAsync Messaging The agent automatically instruments these message systems: RabbitMQ 5.1.0 or higher: Puts and takes on messages and queue purge. When receiving messages using an IBasicConsumer, the EventingBasicConsumer is the only implementation that is instrumented by the .NET agent. BasicGet is instrumented, but the agent does not support distributed tracing for BasicGet. The following methods are instrumented: IModel.BasicGet IModel.BasicPublish IModel.BasicComsume IModel.QueuePurge EventingBasicConsumer.HandleBasicDeliver Unavailable features The following features are not available for the .NET agent: Memory usage on Linux due to an ongoing .NET Core issue (try using .NET performance metrics to get this information) Automatic brower monitoring script injection (API or manual instrumentation is required) The .NET agent does not support trim self-contained deployments and executables, because the compiler can potentially trim assemblies that the agent depends on. Infinite Tracing is not supported on Alpine Linux due to a GRPC compatibility issue. See this agent issue for more information. Connect the agent to other New Relic products In addition to APM, the .NET agent integrates with other New Relic products to give you end-to-end visibility: Product Integration Browser monitoring The browser monitoring JavaScript agent will not be injected by the .NET agent for ASP.NET core applications. However, you can inject the browser agent by using the .NET agent API or the browser agent's copy/paste method. After enabling browser injection, you can view browser data in the APM Summary page and quickly switch between the APM and browser data for a particular app. For configuration options and manual instrumentation, see browser monitoring and the .NET agent. Infrastructure monitoring When you install the Infrastructure and APM agents on the same host, they automatically detect one another. You can then view a list of hosts in the APM UI, and filter your Infrastructure hosts by APM app in the Infrastructure UI. For more information, see APM data in Infrastructure. Dashboards The .NET agent sends default events and attributes for NRQL queries. You can also record custom events for advanced analysis.",

Requirements Agent version nr-593 or higher. Description Adds a user-defined attribute name and value to subsequent events on the page. Make this call before the window load event fires (when that data is transmitted) in order for the attributes to be included in the PageView event. Once an attribute is set, New Relic One records it with all PageAction events until the page is reloaded or the attribute is manually unset. If you are using SPA monitoring with a compatible agent version, attributes set with this call will also be included in newrelic.interaction events. However, attributes set using the SPA API will take precedence over these attributes. Errors for custom attributes will be included in events on the JS Errors page. To view or log errors for a custom attribute via API, use the browser API's noticeError call. Parameters Parameter Description $name string Required. Name of the attribute. Appears as column in the PageView event. It will also appear as a column in the PageAction event if you are using it. Avoid using reserved NRQL words when you name the attribute/value. $value string OR integer Required. Value of the attribute. Appears as the value in the named attribute column in the PageView event. It will appear as a column in the PageAction event if you are using it. Custom attribute values cannot be complex objects, only simple types such as Strings and Integers. Avoid using reserved NRQL words when you name the attribute/value. Examples Get JavaScript/jQuery for HTML elements This example uses JavaScript/jQuery to get the values of the following HTML elements on a Drupal-generated page: <link rel=\"shortlink\" href=\"/node/1111\" /> <h1>Using NRQL</h1> New Relic reports them as custom attributes. This is useful to query PageView and PageAction events in New Relic One. var node_id = ''; node_id= jQuery(\"link[rel='shortlink']\").attr(\"href\"); var node_title = ''; node_title= jQuery('h1').text(); if (typeof newrelic == 'object') { newrelic.setCustomAttribute('nodeId', node_id); newrelic.setCustomAttribute('title', node_title); } Copy",

Before you install the browser agent, make sure your system meets these requirements. Want to try out our browser monitoring? Create a New Relic account for free! No credit card required. Basic requirements To report data to browser, your application must at a minimum meet two basic requirements: The traffic to the application must be from clients able to load and execute browser JavaScript code and set cookies. Clients accessing the application must be able to send data to New Relic through HTTP requests. HTTPS is required for browser Pro features. Important Browsers that subscribe to a disconnect list or that use content filtering extensions such as AdBlock may not be able to send data to New Relic. For example, if you are using the Enhanced Tracking Prevention disconnect list for Mozilla Firefox 69.0 or higher, you will need to change the default configuration. Most typical browser applications meet these requirements. However, browser applications in restricted environments may have difficulty reporting data to New Relic; for example: Hybrid mobile applications Applications installed on unusual hardware, such as point-of-sale terminals or consumer appliances For more information, review the instrumentation for browser monitoring documentation, and verify end-user network access. Browser types Instrumentation is compatible with every browser type, including Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox, Microsoft Internet Explorer and Edge, and Apple Safari. The user interface is compatible with New Relic's supported browser versions. Exceptions Comments Paint timings The firstPaint and firstContentfulPaint attributes in BrowserInteraction, PageView, and PageViewTiming events are only compatible with: Chrome 60 or higher for desktop and mobile (Android webview and Chrome for Android) Opera 47 or higher for desktop Opera 44 or higher for Android mobile Samsung Internet for mobile AJAX AJAX timing features are not available with: Chrome for iPhone and iPad IE 7 and 8 PageAction events PageAction events require a browser that fully supports cross-domain XMLHttpRequests. Internet Explorer versions 9 and lower cannot record PageAction events. Learn more on querying your data. Session traces Session traces are reported only from browsers that support the Resource Timing Specification. SHA-256 New Relic can only monitor browsers that are compatible with SHA-256. APM agents You can deploy the browser agent for apps monitored by APM, or you can deploy the browser agent for your standalone apps. For more information, see the installation procedures. If you are deploying browser for an app using APM, make sure your agent supports browser monitoring: C SDK: Version 1.0.0 or higher Go: Version 2.5.0 or higher Java: Version 3.4.0 or higher .NET: Version 2.20.25.0 or higher Node.js: Version 1.4.0 or higher PHP: Version 4.4.5.35 or higher Python: Version 2.10.1.9 or higher Ruby: Version 3.7.0.177 or higher Supported frameworks The browser agent collects data on all front-end frameworks. However, the monitoring occurs on lower-level \"primitives\" that JavaScript frameworks use, so the level of detail collected by the instrumentation may vary depending on your specific framework. Exceptions Comments Zone.js If you're using AngularJS and you want to use our SPA monitoring features, note that Zone.js versions 0.6.18 to 0.6.24 are not compatible with browser. In all cases, the browser agent must be loaded before Zone.js to avoid errors. Cypress.io Browser is unable to properly instrument the open and send methods of requests when tests are run in Cypress. This will cause the following error to be thrown: Cannot set property 'status' of undefined Copy This will only affect customers running tests with the Browser agent present in their code. Production applications should not be affected. html2pdf.js This library is not compatible with our Pro+SPA agent due to the way this library wraps promises. If you're using this library, we recommend selecting the Pro agent type. Content Security Policy (CSP) considerations In order to obtain accurate browser performance metrics, browser requires the use of a small, inline JavaScript snippet. New Relic carefully reviews the inline JavaScript to prevent Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) and other potential vulnerabilities. Content Security Policy Level 2 adds restrictions to the types of JavaScript allowed, such as inline scripts. It also limits which domains can load scripts during page load. Important If your website does not allow any third-party hosted JavaScript to run, you must request a CSP exception via your organization’s standard procedures in order to install the browser monitoring agent. When requesting a CSP exception, follow your organization's standard procedures to contact your web or security team. The browser JavaScript agent requires the following CSP exceptions in order to run properly. Alternatively, you can add all of these exceptions to the fallback default-src directive (instead of script-src and connect-src). CSP exception Comments unsafe-inline Add to the script-src directive or to the fallback default-src directive. This is required because the agent is installed by including an inline script. https://js-agent.newrelic.com Add to the script-src directive or to the fallback default-src directive. This is where additional script files that the agent requires are hosted. https://bam.nr-data.net https://bam-cell.nr-data.net Important Add https://gov-bam.nr-data.net if you're using FedRAMP-compliant endpoints. Add to the script-src directive or to the fallback default-src directive. This is where the agent sends its collected data. One of the calls to this URL is a JSONP call, which means that the URL must be allowed as a script source. Add to the connect-src directive or to the fallback default-src directive. The connect-src directive affects the URLs that scripts can call (for example, using the XMLHttpRequest interface). If you have CSP restrictions specifically around this directive, then add this URL as an exception.",

Example: Amazon EC2. app name vs. app alias The \"machine name\" that the collector uses to uniquely identify an app is its app name. The server-side configuration setting that changes the visible \"name\" of an app without changing its unique identifier is its app alias. beta Use the beta callout. In the body text, use lowercase. For example: BETA FEATURE This feature is currently in beta. If the developer team prefers to use a term other than beta or private beta, clarify what is driving that use of the term (Legal requirement?), and add any relevant info here in the usage dictionary. bits and bytes Use standard prefixes and capitalization for International System of Units (SI), International Organization for Standardization (ISO), or Joint Electron Device Engineering Council (JEDEC memory) values when referring to multiples of bits (b) and bytes (B). 1 byte = 8 bits. Decimal value SI prefix Binary value ISO prefix JEDEC prefix 1000 k: kilo 1024 Ki: kibi K: kilo 1000^2 M: mega 1024^2 Mi: mebi M: mega 1000^3 G: giga 1024^3 Gi: gibi G: giga 1000^4 T: tera 1024^4 Ti: tebi - -- 1000^5 P: peta 1024^5 Pi: pebi - -- Tip For help with converting byte values (such as bytes to kilobytes), try this byte converter. blacklist and whitelist Don't use. Instead, use deny list and allow list; for example, \"Add a hostname to your deny list.\" capitalization This is more complex than can be covered in this usage dictionary. For detailed information, see: Heading capitalization Capitalization of features and UI elements Child account A parent account contains one or more child accounts. Child accounts were previously referred to as \"sub-accounts\". click In general, use click rather than the vaguer select. For example, you might click something in the UI, but then select something from a list. Be particularly careful to use click to describe actions that only make sense with a mouse; for example, with a right click or a click and drag. Also use click when the user must click on a non-selectable object (to save your changes, click anywhere outside the dialog box). See also [mouse over] #mouse-over). collector vs. connect to New Relic When referring to an agent talking to the New Relic servers, describe this as the New Relic collector. Although internally the collector refers only to specific parts of our architecture, we use it more broadly in our documentation to mean \"any endpoint a customer must connect to report data, for any product.\" Avoid \"connect to New Relic,\" and do not use \"connect to the New Relic UI.\" contractions When it makes sense for clarity, conciseness, and tone and voice, use contractions. Use them where they make the writing sound more like natural speech, and where they improve clarity and accessibility without sacrificing expertise and authority. There are no hard and fast rules for which contractions are or aren't acceptable, but simple and common is preferable to complicated and rare. For example, it's for it is is fine, but less common constructions like mustn't or wouldn't've are best avoided. Also: When using a negative contraction (don't, can't, won't) try to provide some additional info about what what to do and what can be done. (See the style guide intro for more on this.) There are places in our docs—for example, in notes and warnings—where spelling out do not, cannot, or will not is preferable to contractions to emphasize the action or blockage to be avoided. customer vs. user When possible, use the second person you to form a sense of connection with the reader. For times when you need a descriptive third-person noun, keep the following guidelines in mind: customer and user are both appropriate depending on context. customer makes more sense when talking about billing, or about a group of people or a business entity. For example, one customer may have one or more individual users who interact with New Relic through the customer's account(s). user makes more sense as a general term for an individual user, or when talking about users as an object in the account model. For example, when discussing account models, it's important to be specific about what constitutes a single person identity in our system. dashboard Don't use. Instead, use page. doc, document, documentation, docs site If you need to refer to the docs themselves—don't. Generally it's better to directly link to the doc you're referencing and use the doc title as your link text. For example, See [Install the .NET agent](URL) rather than See our [.NET agent install docs](URL). If there's not a good alternative, doc generally sounds more natural than document or documentation. If you're tempted to use a longer form, try reading it aloud to see which reads best. If you must refer to the site as a whole, call it the docs site rather than Docs site or documentation site. Internally, you can also refer to the whole URL docs.newrelic.com to avoid ambiguity with other sources of docs like internal platform docs or API explorer docs. To refer to our docs GitHub repo, use the repo name docs-website or the repo path newrelic/docs-website. dropdown Use dropdown instead of drop-down or drop down. Although it isn't common usage, you can use dropdown independently as a noun, without needing to say dropdown menu or dropdown list. For example, select a date from the <b>date</b> dropdown. e.g. and i.e. Don't use Latin abbreviations. Instead of e.g., use for example or such as. Instead of i.e. or its English equivalent in other words, rewrite so your description is clear. em dash (—) Em dashes are rarely needed in tech docs, sadly. You can usually accomplish what you need to by breaking the thought into multiple sentences or using parentheses. In some rare cases, though, an em dash can add drama and spice. If you think you've found such a case, make sure you use them right. An em dash should always use the real em dash character (not a hyphen), and no space before and after. For example: You can sign up for New Relic fast and free—we won't even ask for a credit card number. Copy You can insert an em dash with the COMMAND+OPTION+- shortcut or use the HTML entity. etc. Unlike the Latin abbreviations e.g. or i.e.), you're welcome to use etc. Please ensure that you have several meaningful examples, though, before using. For example, cities including Portland, Seattle, Dublin, etc. but not cities including Portland, etc.. hostname This is one word. Don't hyphenate. icons When using an inline icon from the UI, always describe it first, then embed the icon image, and then end with the word icon. For example, select the delete icon. Don't put icons in bold. When writing about icons, describe the icon for its purpose or action, not what the icon looks like. For example: Yes: Select the edit icon. No: Select the pencil icon. For technical information on embedding images, see Inserting inline images and Embedding Font Awesome icons. index A list of entities, such as the APM applications index, the Synthetics Monitors index, or the Alerts Incidents index. See also page. infrastructure Don't use, unless referring to the New Relic Infrastructure product. Instead, use an appropriate substitute such as architecture, environment, system, host, etc. introduction Always use Introduction to for overview docs for a particular product. For example, Introduction to New Relic Infrastructure or Introduction to the PHP agent or Introduction to transaction traces. Don't use welcome to, basics, intro, overview, etc. Also avoid the Thing: Tagline format, as in X-Ray sessions: Traces and thread profiles for key transactions, unless having a title with keywords will help with SEO. macOS The proper name for Apple's desktop operating system is macOS. Don't use the older product names Mac OS X or OS X. master account We previously used \"master account\" and \"sub-account\" but now we use parent account and child account. menu The list of pages and indexes on the top and left sides of the New Relic user interface. mouse over For mouse movements that involve placing the mouse pointer over an area, but not clicking it. For example, the APM Overview page includes functions that are only visible when the mouse pointer is over a particular chart. Do not use point to or hover over. See also click. .NET Always refer to the agent and language as .NET, never as .Net or .net or dotnet. New Relic One New Relic One isn't a product. It's a way to view New Relic data more easily, all in one place, and from multiple related accounts. This has several implications for how we should refer to it: Avoid phrasing that makes New Relic One sound like a separate product or a separate platform. There is a single New Relic platform through which our users interact with our products. Avoid mentioning New Relic One where it can be avoided. For example, instead of saying \"Use New Relic One workloads to...\", you could instead say, \"In New Relic, you can use workloads to...\" and then in the doc explain where to find the feature. Another example: instead of referring to \"The programmable New Relic One platform,\" we might say, \"The New Relic platform is programmable: To start building, go to one.newrelic.com and...\" Do not use NR1 or nr1 as an abbreviation of New Relic One. The only reason to use nr1 is when referring to the nr1 package or library (for example: a reference to the command nr1 nerdpack:serve). In general, we want to avoid overloading our docs with \"New Relic\". For more details, see the New Relic One messaging guidelines, the docs glossary entry, or the New Relic One docs. Node.js Always refer to the programming language as Node.js, not Node. NR ONLY Use NR ONLY for internal consumption only (such as this style guide). Don't use NR-ONLY or NRONLY or New Relic Only. Oxford comma See serial comma. open source Use lower case for open source. Some legal contracts may require upper case. page A specific place in the New Relic UI, located at a particular URL. Compare and contrast index, menu, and UI. Don't use dashboard, menu, tab, screen, or similar terms. parent account New Relic organizations can have a parent/child account structure. This is more important for our original user model but still plays a role for some behind-the-scenes features on our New Relic One user model. Learn more about account structure. Parent accounts were previously referred to as master accounts, and there are still some uses of this in the codebase. permissions See User-related language. For pricing tier/edition language, see Pricing language. pricing See Pricing language. real user monitoring (RUM) Don't use this outside of browser monitoring docs. Often abbreviated as RUM, this is a generic industry term for browser monitoring. New Relic refers to this as page load timing or browser monitoring. Use this term only for SEO or clarification, not to refer to the actual feature. record vs. report vs. collect Use report when discussing data sent to New Relic, such as, \"your host reports data to New Relic.\" Avoid using report as a noun. Instead use \"the reported metrics\" or \"the collected data.\" If \"report\" sounds too clunky, you can also use collect as long as whatever New Relic is collecting doesn't sound security sensitive. RPM Don't refer to the New Relic UI as RPM. Always refer to the specific product, such as the APM UI or the Browser UI. However, you may use rpm when required in the visible URL string in UI paths. serial comma Also referred to as an Oxford comma. Always use serial commas with inline lists. For example, Portland, Seattle, and Dublin rather than Portland, Seattle and Dublin. time zone Include a space (time zone). Don't hyphenate or run together as timezone. UI The graphical component of a New Relic product, encompassing all its pages, menus, and indexes. See also UI paths. UI paths If you need to tell a user how to path through the UI, see our style guide page on UI paths. update vs. upgrade Use update when users need to change the version of whatever they're using. No money or payment is needed for an update. Use upgrade whenever money or payment may be involved, such as upgrading to the Pro version of a product. The new pricing model makes it unlikely that you'll need to use this. users For styles and formats related to user roles and groups and more, see User-related style. username, not user name One word (username), not two. This is the most common usage and is recommended by Microsoft and Google style guides. version number references When referring to multiple version numbers, always use or higher. Don't use and higher, or the words greater or later. Also don't use punctuation, as in version 1.2+. For example: Foo requires Ruby agent version 1.2.3 or higher. Copy In addition: Tell users to use the latest version and not an up-to-date or current version. To abbreviate the word version, use a lowercase v with no space before the number; for example, v2 or v1.2.3. Use update not upgrade when talking about agent versions, as in \"To update to the latest version...\" For security reasons, do not use version numbers with licensing docs. The Tech Docs team doesn't have a set standard when referring to previous versions. Recommendation: Consider using version x.x or lower when identifying a specific version. Consider using In earlier agent versions when referring to versions more vaguely. we Say “we” and “our” when it works with the flow of your writing. Avoid overloading paragraphs with “New Relic” mentions, or reword so the focus is on the user, not New Relic. For example, avoid writing something like this: New Relic recommends setting a startup timeout. Copy Instead, write something like this: Recommendation: To help with troubleshooting, include a startup timeout in your configuration. Copy OR We recommend setting a startup timeout. Copy you We use “you” and “your” liberally in our docs. Addressing the reader directly makes for simpler, cleaner sentences. It also tends to expose lazy uses of passive construction and it helps users to understand procedures.",

      "body": "Browser uses a JavaScript snippet, also referred to as an \"agent,\" to instrument your app's webpages. The JavaScript collects data for browser monitoring. To install the browser agent, you can choose from a number of deployment options. If you don't have one already, create a New Relic account. It's free, forever. Enable browser monitoring Browser Pro+SPA is the default agent when you enable browser monitoring. This automatically gives you access to all of our browser monitoring features. For more information about the browser monitoring options, see Browser agent types in this document. To enable browser monitoring: Go to one.newrelic.com, select Browser, and then select Add more data. Follow the instructions in the UI to add browser monitoring to your app. Generate some traffic for your app, then wait a few minutes for data to appear in New Relic. Optional: After installation is complete and you are seeing data, go to the App settings page for additional agent configuration, or to change the browser agent type. It may take several minutes after enabling the browser monitoring agent before your webpage data appear in New Relic. If have problems, follow our troubleshooting tips. Deployment options No matter which option you use to deploy browser monitoring, the end result is the same: the browser monitoring JavaScript snippet (also referred to as the \"agent\") is inserted into your app pages. The method you select depends on your preferences and business needs. Enable an APM-monitored app When enabling browser monitoring, you can use an APM agent to automatically inject the browser monitoring JavaScript snippet for you. This is the easiest way to install the agent for an app that's already being monitored by APM. APM-monitored apps are listed on your APM Applications index. Enable with copy/paste When enabling browser monitoring, you can manually insert the JavaScript snippet into your app's webpages. The copy/paste option gives you control over the exact placement of our JavaScript snippet, which is required to monitor the webpage's performance. This is useful for: Standalone apps, static sites, and cached pages delivered by CDN APM apps that are not as closely coupled to the browser app as with a standard server-side app (for example, when your client-side app talks to a REST API back end) Some tips for using the JavaScript snippet: Placement in your webpage: Copy the code snippet, then paste it inline into your pages as close to the top of the <head> element as possible, but after any position-sensitive <meta> tags (for example, X-UA-Compatible or charset information). For more information on the inline head placement, see JavaScript placement requirements. License key and app ID: Near the bottom of the generated JavaScript is your browser license key and application ID. This is useful with the REST API and API Explorer. Instrument webpages using the APM agent This information applies to apps that are also monitored by APM. Our APM agents can instrument webpages with the required JavaScript for page load timing. If you are using an APM agent's API to manually add the JavaScript snippet to your webpages, insert the instrumentation snippet as close to the top as possible. This allows you to take advantage of detailed information about browser's AJAX calls and JavaScript errors. For more information, see the instructions for your APM agent: C SDK Go Java .NET Node.js PHP Python Ruby Use REST API This information applies to apps that are also monitored by APM. The REST API lets you manage deployment outside the browser monitoring UI. This is useful for large organizations deploying multiple apps. Browser agent types: Lite, Pro, Pro+SPA We have three types of browser agents: Lite, Pro, and Pro+SPA. The agent type has no impact on your billing. Browser agent type Comparison Pro+SPA This is the default installed agent when you enable browser monitoring. What it includes: Gives you access to all of the Browser Pro features and to Single Page App (SPA) monitoring. Provides detailed page timing data and the most up-to-date New Relic features, including distributed tracing, for all types of applications. Pro+SPA is not limited only to single page applications. After install, you can downgrade anytime to the less advanced agents if you don't want or need SPA monitoring. Pro What it includes: Gives you access to the Browser Pro features. What it doesn't include: Lacks the functionality designed for single page app monitoring. Lite What it includes: Gives you information about some basic page load timing and browser user information. What it doesn't include: Lacks the Browser Pro features and SPA features. Details about how agent types relate to pricing: New Relic One pricing: This pricing plan has data ingest as a billing factor. If you want to reduce data ingest, you may want to consider downgrading to lesser agent types after install. Original pricing: Your access to browser monitoring features is gated by your subscription plan, not by the agent type. This means there is no reason not to use the default Pro+SPA agent. After initial agent installation is finished, you can go to the App settings page to edit your configuration or to change your subscription.",

      "body": "You can tailor the Node.js agent to your app's requirements by editing your newrelic.js config file or by setting an environment variable. The config file resides in the root directory of your app. You can also configure a few options from New Relic, or use the Node.js agent API. Important The license_key setting is required. We highly recommend setting the app_name so that your app has a meaningful name instead of the default My Application. Configuration methods and precedence The primary method to configure the Node.js agent is the agent configuration file (newrelic.js). You can also configure most settings with environment variables. You can also adjust some settings with server-side configuration. The Node.js agent uses this order of precedence for configuration methods: Node.js configuration hierarchy: Server-side configuration settings override environment variables. Environment variables override the agent config file. The config file overrides the agent defaults. Here are detailed descriptions of each configuration method: Agent configuration file The config file (newrelic.js) contains every Node.js agent setting. When you install the Node.js agent, you must copy newrelic.js into your app's root directory. Most settings are empty by default; they inherit their values from config/default.js. Environment variables Most configuration settings in newrelic.js have equivalent environment variables. These are useful, for example, if your agent runs in a PaaS environment such as Heroku or Microsoft Azure. Node.js agent environment variables always start with NEW_RELIC_. Where available, these environment variables are documented below under individual config options as the Environ variable. There are also two rarely used settings that can only be configured via environment variables. Server-side configuration Owners and Admins can view and configure a few settings directly in New Relic. Where available, the UI labels for server-side config are listed in this document under individual config options as the Server-side label. Exports variables This section defines the Node.js agent variables in the order they typically appear in the exports.config = { section of your app's newrelic.js configuration file. app_name (REQUIRED) Type String Default \"My Application\" Environ variable NEW_RELIC_APP_NAME The name New Relic uses to identify your app. For example, app_name: ['MyNodeApp']. To use multiple names for your app, specify a comma-delimited list of names. Data for all applications with the same name will be merged in the New Relic UI, so set this carefully. We highly recommend that you replace the default name with a descriptive name to avoid confusion and unintended aggregation of data. Tip For Azure users, the Node.js agent will use APP_POOL_ID if it is set, so you can use the name you chose for your Azure Web Server without setting it twice. license_key (REQUIRED) Type String Default (none) Environ variable NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY This setting is required. Your New Relic license key. For example, license_key: '40HexadecimalCharacters'. agent_enabled Type Boolean Default true Environ variable NEW_RELIC_ENABLED Set to false to stop the agent from starting up. This is useful when debugging your code requires temporarily disabling the agent. It prevents the agent from bootstrapping its instrumentation or setting up all its pieces, which prevents the agent from starting up and connecting to New Relic's servers. allow_all_headers If true, enables capture of all HTTP headers, except for those filtered by exclude rules. If false, collected headers are limited to those defined in Node.js agent attributes. Type Boolean Default false Caution Any header-related include/exclude rules must be in camelCase form to be filtered. apdex_t (DEPRECATED) Type Number Default 0.100 Server-side label Apdex T Set your Apdex T via the New Relic UI. certificates Type Array of strings Default (none) Additional certificates to trust for SSL connections, specified as an array of strings in PEM format. This affects both connections to an HTTPS proxy and connections to New Relic. Tip You can also configure the agent to read its certificates from a file: certificates: [ fs.readFileSync('myca.crt', {encoding: 'utf8'}) ] Copy high_security Type Boolean Default false Environ variable NEW_RELIC_HIGH_SECURITY When set to true, enables high security v2. You must also enable the ssl setting and enable high security in the UI. host Type String Default collector.newrelic.com Environ variable NEW_RELIC_HOST Important Do not edit this value unless New Relic Support asks you to change it. Hostname for the New Relic collector to connect to the Internet; for example, host: 'collector.newrelic.com'. labels Adds tags. Specify your tags as objects or a semicolon-delimited string of colon-separated pairs (for example, Server:One;Data Center:Primary). Type Object or string Default (none) Environ variable NEW_RELIC_LABELS port Type Integer Default 443 Environ variable NEW_RELIC_PORT Important Do not edit this value unless New Relic Support asks you to change it. Port number to connect to the New Relic collector; for example, port: 443. proxy Type String Default (none) Environ variable NEW_RELIC_PROXY_URL A URL specifying the proxy server to connect to the Internet. For example, proxy: 'http://user:pass@10.0.0.1:8000/'. Important The proxy config file setting overrides the other config file proxy settings (proxy_host, proxy_port, proxy_user, proxy_pass) if used. Similarly, the NEW_RELIC_PROXY_URL environment variable overrides the other environment variable proxy settings (NEW_RELIC_PROXY_HOST, NEW_RELIC_PROXY_PORT, NEW_RELIC_PROXY_USER, and NEW_RELIC_PROXY_PASS) if used. proxy_host Type String Default (none) Environ variable NEW_RELIC_PROXY_HOST Hostname or IP address of the proxy server to connect to the Internet. proxy_pass Type String Default (none) Environ variable NEW_RELIC_PROXY_PASS Password for authenticating to the proxy server. The agent supports only basic HTTP authentication. proxy_port Type String Default (none) Environ variable NEW_RELIC_PROXY_PORT Port number of the proxy server to connect to the Internet. proxy_user Type String Default (none) Environ variable NEW_RELIC_PROXY_USER User name for authenticating to the proxy server. The agent supports only basic HTTP authentication. Logging variables This section defines the Node.js agent variables in the order they typically appear in the logging: { section of your app's newrelic.js configuration file. enabled Type String Default true (false in serverless_mode) Environ variable NEW_RELIC_LOG_ENABLED Enables or disables agent specific logging. level Type String Default info Environ variable NEW_RELIC_LOG_LEVEL Defines the level of detail recorded in the agent logs. From least detail to most detail, possible values are fatal, error, warn, info, debug, or trace. Caution Do not use debug or trace logging unless New Relic Support asks you to use them. These levels of logging can generate excessive overhead. For most situations, use info. filepath Type String Default process.cwd() plus newrelic_agent.log Environ variable NEW_RELIC_LOG Complete path to the New Relic agent log, including the filename. Defaults to filepath: require('path').join(process.cwd(), 'newrelic_agent.log'). The agent will shut down the process if it cannot create this file. The agent creates a log file with the same permissions as the parent Node.js agent process. To write all logging to stdout, set this to stdout. To write all logging to stderr, set this to stderr. Audit logging This section defines the Node.js agent variables in the order they typically appear in the audit_log: { section of your app's newrelic.js configuration file. enabled Type Boolean Default false Environ variable NEW_RELIC_AUDIT_LOG_ENABLED When enabled, the agent logs the payloads it sends to the collector. This data is included in the main log file even when logging level is set to the lowest level. endpoints Type Array Default Empty array (include all types) Environ variable NEW_RELIC_AUDIT_LOG_ENDPOINTS The agent sends several different types of data to the collector in separate payloads. By default, all of them are included in the log file. This option makes it possible to limit logging only to specific types of data. Valid values include: agent_settings analytic_event_data connect custom_event_data error_data error_event_data metric_data preconnect shutdown span_event_data sql_trace_data transaction_sample_data API configuration This section allows you to choose which API methods are enabled. Each configuration option allows you to modularly enable API methods that are responsible for sending custom information to New Relic. Important All of these are set to false when the agent is in high security mode. custom_attributes_enabled Type Boolean Default true Environ variable NEW_RELIC_API_CUSTOM_ATTRIBUTES This option enables newrelic.addCustomAttribute and newrelic.addCustomAttributes. custom_events_enabled Type Boolean Default true Environ variable NEW_RELIC_API_CUSTOM_EVENTS This option enables recordCustomEvent. notice_error_enabled Type Boolean Default true Environ variable NEW_RELIC_API_NOTICE_ERROR This option enables newrelic.noticeError. Attributes This section defines the variables for Node.js agent attributes in the order they typically appear in the attributes: { section of your app's newrelic.js configuration file. Caution Any header-related include/exclude rules must be in camelCase form to be filtered. enabled Type Boolean Default true Environ variable NEW_RELIC_ATTRIBUTES_ENABLED If true, enables capture of attributes for all destinations. exclude Type Array Default [] Environ variable NEW_RELIC_ATTRIBUTES_EXCLUDE Prefix of attributes to exclude from all destinations. Allows * as wildcard at end. include Type Array Default [] Environ variable NEW_RELIC_ATTRIBUTES_INCLUDE Prefix of attributes to include from all destinations. Allows * as wildcard at end. include_enabled Type Boolean Default true Environ variable NEW_RELIC_ATTRIBUTES_INCLUDE_ENABLED When true, patterns may be added to the attributes.include list. Error collector variables You can manage how error are handled in New Relic. This section defines the Node.js agent variables in the order they typically appear in the error_collector: { section of your app's newrelic.js configuration file. enabled Type Boolean Default true Environ variable NEW_RELIC_ERROR_COLLECTOR_ENABLED Server-side label Enable error collection? When enabled, the agent collects error traces from your app. ignore_status_codes Type Array Default 404 Environ variable NEW_RELIC_ERROR_COLLECTOR_IGNORE_ERROR_CODES Server-side label Ignore these status codes Comma-delimited list of HTTP status codes for the error collector to ignore. Caution Errors recorded using newrelic.noticeError do not obey this configuration value. ignore_classes Type Array|Object Default [] Environ variable NEW_RELIC_ERROR_COLLECTOR_IGNORE_ERRORS Comma-delimited list of javascript error types/classes for the error collector to ignore. The following configuration /* ... */ error_collector: { ignore_classes: [\"ReferenceError\"] } /* ... */ Copy Would ignore all reference errors. Caution Errors recorded using newrelic.noticeError do not obey this configuration value. ignore_messages Type Object Default {} A javascript object describing a list of javascript classes tied to javascript error messages for the collector to ignore. The following configuration. /* ... */ error_collector: { /* ... */ ignore_messages: {\"Error\":[\"Undefined\", \"Out of time\"]} /* ... */ } /* ... */ Copy Would ignore all errors of type Error, with the exact (case-sensitive) message strings of Undefined and Out of time. Caution Errors recorded using newrelic.noticeError do not obey this configuration value. expected_status_codes Type Array Default [] Environ variable NEW_RELIC_ERROR_COLLECTOR_EXPECTED_ERROR_CODES Comma-delimited list of HTTP status codes for the error collector to mark as expected. Caution Errors recorded using newrelic.noticeError do not obey this configuration value. expected_classes Type Array Default [] Environ variable NEW_RELIC_ERROR_COLLECTOR_EXPECTED_ERRORS The following configuration /* ... */ error_collector: { expected_classes: [\"ReferenceError\"] } /* ... */ Copy Would mark all reference errors as expected. Caution Errors recorded using newrelic.noticeError do not obey this configuration value. expected_messages Type Object Default {} A javascript object describing a list of javascript classes tied to javascript error messages for the collector to ignore. The following configuration. /* ... */ error_collector: { /* ... */ expected_messages: {\"Error\":[\"Undefined\", \"Out of time\"]} /* ... */ } /* ... */ Copy Would mark all errors of type Error, with the exact (case-sensitive) message strings of Undefined and Out of time. Caution Errors recorded using newrelic.noticeError do not obey this configuration value. attributes.enabled Type Boolean Default true Environ variable NEW_RELIC_ERROR_COLLECTOR_ATTRIBUTES_ENABLED If true, the agent captures attributes from error collection. Caution Any header-related include/exclude rules must be in camelCase form to be filtered. attributes.exclude Type Array Default [] Environ variable NEW_RELIC_ERROR_COLLECTOR_ATTRIBUTES_EXCLUDE Prefix of attributes to exclude from error collection. Allows * as wildcard at end. attributes.include Type Array Default [] Environ variable NEW_RELIC_ERROR_COLLECTOR_ATTRIBUTES_INCLUDE Prefix of attributes to include in error collection. Allows * as wildcard at end. max_event_samples_stored Type Integer Default 100 Environ variable NEW_RELIC_ERROR_COLLECTOR_MAX_EVENT_SAMPLES_STORED Defines the maximum number of events the agent collects per minute. If there are more than this number, the agent collects a statistical sampling. Transaction tracer variables The agent groups your requests into transactions, which are used to: Visualize where your app spends its time (in transaction breakdowns). Identify slow requests. Group metrics. Isolate other issues, such as slow database performance. This section defines the Node.js agent variables in the order they typically appear in the transaction_tracer: { section of your app's newrelic.js configuration file. Important Do not use brackets [suffix] at the end of your transaction name. New Relic automatically strips brackets from the name. Instead, use parentheses (suffix) or other symbols if needed. enabled Type Boolean Default true Environ variable NEW_RELIC_TRACER_ENABLED Server-side label Enable transaction tracing? When enabled, the agent collects slow transaction traces. explain_threshold Type Integer Default 500 Environ variable NEW_RELIC_EXPLAIN_THRESHOLD Minimum query duration (in milliseconds) for a transaction to be eligible for slow queries in transaction traces. record_sql Type String (off, obfuscated, or raw) Default off Environ variable NEW_RELIC_RECORD_SQL This option affects both slow queries and record_sql for transaction traces. It can have one of three values: off, obfuscated, or raw. When set to off no slow queries will be captured, and backtraces and SQL will not be included in transaction traces. If set to raw or obfuscated, the agent sends raw or obfuscated SQL and a slow query sample to the collector. The agent may also send SQL when other criteria are met, such as when slow_sql.enabled is set. top_n Type Integer Default 20 Environ variable NEW_RELIC_TRACER_TOP_N Defines the maximum number of requests eligible for transaction traces. Transactions are named based on the request, and top_n refers to the \"top n slowest transactions\" grouped by these names. The module replaces a recorded trace with a new trace only if the new trace is slower than the previous slowest trace of that name. The default value for this setting is top_n: 20, because the Transactions page also defaults to the 20 slowest transactions. The Node.js agent captures at least five different slow transactions in the first harvest cycle after start up. It will also reset and capture different transactions if no slow transactions have been captured for the last five harvest cycles. This allows you to see more information about more of your app's request paths, at the possible cost of not focusing on the absolutely slowest request for that harvest cycle. Tip To record the absolute slowest transaction over the last minute, you can set top_n: 0 or top_n: 1. However, this causes one very slow route to dominate your transaction traces. transaction_threshold Type Integer or apdex_f Default apdex_f Environ variable NEW_RELIC_TRACER_THRESHOLD Server-side label Threshold Threshold of web transaction response time in seconds beyond which a transaction is eligible for transaction tracing. The default value is apdex_f; this sets the trace threshold to four times your application's Apdex T. You can also enter a specific time value in milliseconds. Example: Threshold set to apdex_f The default apdex_t is 100 milliseconds. If your transaction threshold is set to apdex_f, a \"slow\" transaction is 400 milliseconds. hide_internals Type boolean Default true Environ variable NEW_RELIC_HIDE_INTERNALS The agent uses a small amount of CPU in order to hide internal properties that are attached to the web application. If you change this configuration to false, it may slightly decrease your agent overhead, but it could also have an impact on the performance of the agent. attributes.enabled Type Boolean Default true Environ variable NEW_RELIC_TRANSACTION_TRACER_ATTRIBUTES_ENABLED If true, the agent captures attributes from transaction traces. Caution Any header-related include/exclude rules must be in camelCase form to be filtered. attributes.exclude Type Array Default [] Environ variable NEW_RELIC_TRANSACTION_TRACER_ATTRIBUTES_EXCLUDE Prefix of attributes to exclude from transaction traces. Allows * as wildcard at end. attributes.include Type Array Default [] Environ variable NEW_RELIC_TRANSACTION_TRACER_ATTRIBUTES_INCLUDE Prefix of attributes to include in transaction traces. Allows * as wildcard at end. Rules variables This section defines the Node.js agent variables in the order they typically appear in the rules: { section of your app's newrelic.js configuration file. name Type Strings or regular expressions Default (none) Environ variable NEW_RELIC_NAMING_RULES A comma-delimited list of rules to match incoming request URLs and name the associated New Relic transaction. Uses the format: name: [ {pattern: 'STRING_OR_REGEX', name: 'NAME'}, {pattern: 'STRING_OR_REGEX', name: 'NAME'} ], Copy Both parameters are required. For strings, you must escape control characters. You do not need to escape control characters in regular expressions. Additional attributes are ignored. Regular expressions support JavaScript-style capture groups, and names use $1-style replacement strings. Regular expressions only find the first matching result; subsequent matches are ignored. For more information, see Node.js transaction naming API. For the NEW_RELIC_NAMING_RULES environment variable, pass the rules as comma-delimited JSON object literals: NEW_RELIC_NAMING_RULES='{\"pattern\":\"^t\",\"name\":\"u\"},{\"pattern\":\"^u\",\"name\":\"t\"}' Copy ignore Type Strings or regular expressions Default Regular expression to match socket.io long-polling requests (\"^ \\ /socket \\ .io \\ /. * \\ /xhr-polling/\"). Environ variable NEW_RELIC_IGNORING_RULES Define a list of request URLs you want the agent to ignore. Specify the list as patterns, which can be strings or regular expressions. enforce_backstop Type Boolean Default true Environ variable NEW_RELIC_ENFORCE_BACKSTOP Caution Do not change this setting unless you understand metric grouping issues. When enabled, the agent renames transactions that are not affected by other naming logic (such as the API, rules, or metric normalization rules) to NormalizedUri/*. If you set this to false, the agent sets transaction names to Uri/path/to/resource. Transaction events variables This section defines the Node.js agent variables in the order they typically appear in the transaction_events: { section of your app's newrelic.js configuration file. enabled Type Boolean Default true When enabled, the agent sends transaction events to New Relic. This event data includes transaction timing, transaction name, and any custom parameters. If this is disabled, the agent does not collect this data or send it to New Relic. max_samples_stored Type Integer Default 10000 Environ variable NEW_RELIC_TRANSACTION_EVENTS_MAX_SAMPLES_STORED Defines the maximum number of events the agent collects per minute. If there are more than this number, the agent collects a statistical sampling. We do not recommend configuring past 10,000. The server will cap data at 10,000 per-minute. Important This configuration had different behavior in agent versions lower than 6.0.0. See max_samples_stored (DEPRECATED) for agent versions 5.x or lower. max_samples_stored (DEPRECATED) Type Integer Default 20000 Defines the maximum number of events the agent stores if it is unable to communicate with the New Relic collector. The values from the previous harvest cycle will be merged into the next one, with this option limiting the maximum number. Make sure this number is greater than max_samples_per_minute; for example, set it to twice as much. Consider your memory overhead before increasing this value. Caution This configuration has different behavior starting with agent version 6.0.0 and a new recommended maximum. See max_samples_stored for agent versions 6.x or higher. max_samples_per_minute (DEPRECATED) Type Integer Default 10000 Defines the maximum number of events the agent collects per minute. If there are more than this number, the agent collects a statistical sampling. Caution This configuration has been replaced with max_samples_stored starting with version 6.0.0 of the agent. See max_samples_stored for 6.x or later agents. attributes.enabled Type Boolean Default true Environ variable NEW_RELIC_TRANSACTION_EVENTS_ATTRIBUTES_ENABLED If true, the agent captures attributes from transaction events. Caution Any header-related include/exclude rules must be in camelCase form to be filtered. attributes.exclude Type Array Default [] Environ variable NEW_RELIC_TRANSACTION_EVENTS_ATTRIBUTES_EXCLUDE Prefix of attributes to exclude from transaction events. Allows * as wildcard at end. attributes.include Type Array Default [] Environ variable NEW_RELIC_TRANSACTION_EVENTS_ATTRIBUTES_INCLUDE Prefix of attributes to include in transaction events. Allows * as wildcard at end. Browser monitoring variables This section defines the Node.js agent variables in the order they typically appear in the browser_monitoring: { section of your app's newrelic.js configuration file. enable Type Boolean Default true Environ variable NEW_RELIC_BROWSER_MONITOR_ENABLE Server-side label Enable browser monitoring? Generate JavaScript headers for browser instrumentation. Although this defaults to true, the agent doesn't inject the browser JS code unless you have enabled browser monitoring. Even if you have enabled it and added the browser timing header, you can disable browser monitoring for your app by setting this to false. debug Type Boolean Default false Environ variable NEW_RELIC_BROWSER_MONITOR_DEBUG If true, request un-minified sources from the server. attributes.enabled Type Boolean Default false Environ variable NEW_RELIC_BROWSER_MONITORING_ATTRIBUTES_ENABLED If true, the agent sends custom attributes to browser monitoring. Caution Any header-related include/exclude rules must be in camelCase form to be filtered. attributes.exclude Type Array Default [] Environ variable NEW_RELIC_BROWSER_MONITORING_ATTRIBUTES_EXCLUDE Prefix of attributes to exclude from browser monitoring. Allows * as wildcard at end. attributes.include Type Array Default [] Environ variable NEW_RELIC_BROWSER_MONITORING_ATTRIBUTES_INCLUDE Prefix of attributes to include in browser monitoring. Allows * as wildcard at end. Custom events variables This section defines the Node.js agent variables in the order they typically appear in the custom_insights_events: { section of your app's newrelic.js configuration file. Currently there are no environment variables for custom events. enabled Type Boolean Default true When enabled, the agent sends custom events recorded with recordCustomEvent() to New Relic. If this is disabled, the agent does not collect this data or send it to New Relic. max_samples_stored Type Integer Default 1000 Environ variable NEW_RELIC_CUSTOM_INSIGHTS_EVENTS_MAX_SAMPLES_STORED Defines the maximum number of custom events the agent collects per minute. If the number of custom events exceeds this limit, the agent collects a statistical sampling. Important Increasing this limit increases memory usage. Slow queries variables This section defines the Node.js agent variables in the order they typically appear in the slow_sql: { section of your app's newrelic.js configuration file. These options control behavior for slow queries, but do not affect SQL nodes in transaction traces. enabled Type Boolean Default false Environ variable NEW_RELIC_SLOW_SQL_ENABLED When enabled, the agent collects slow query details. max_samples Type Integer Default 10 Environ variable NEW_RELIC_MAX_SQL_SAMPLES Defines the maximum number of slow queries the agent collects per minute. The agent discards additional queries after the limit is reached. Important Increasing this limit increases memory usage. Custom hostname variables This section defines the Node.js agent variables in the order they typically appear in the process_host: { section of your app's newrelic.js configuration file. These options control behavior regarding the host display name in the APM UI. display_name Type String of 255 bytes or less Default (none) Environ variable NEW_RELIC_PROCESS_HOST_DISPLAY_NAME Specify a custom hostname for display in New Relic. If you do not set this field, New Relic will continue to use the default hostname found by calling os.hostname(). If you use the default hostname settings, New Relic finds the hostname through os.hostname(). If this call fails, New Relic uses the host's IP as the name. If you set ipv_preference: 4 or ipv_preference: 6, you can select the type of IP address (IPv4 or IPv6) that appears in the New Relic UI. ipv_preference Type Integer (4 or 6) Default 4 Environ variable NEW_RELIC_IPV_PREFERENCE Environment variable overrides This section defines two configuration options only available with environment variables. These overrides are not used in most configurations. NEW_RELIC_HOME Path to the directory containing newrelic.js. This is available only as an environment variable. You cannot set it in your config file. Type String Default (none) NEW_RELIC_NO_CONFIG_FILE If used, this prevents the agent from reading configuration settings from newrelic.js. Default values and values from environment variables will still be set. This is available only as an environment variable. You cannot set it in your config file. Type Boolean Default False Datastore tracer variables This section defines the Node.js agent variables in the order they typically appear in the datastore_tracer section of your app's newrelic.js configuration file. These options control behavior for collecting datastore instance metrics. instance_reporting.enabled Type Boolean Default true When enabled, the agent collects datastore instance metrics (such as host and port) for some database drivers. These are reported on slow query traces and transaction traces. database_name_reporting.enabled Type Boolean Default true When enabled, the agent collects database name on slow query traces and transaction traces for some database drivers. Cross application tracing (DEPRECATED) The Node.js agent variables that control cross application tracing typically appear in the cross_application_tracer section of your app's newrelic.js configuration file: enabled Type Boolean Default false When set to true, allows tracing of transactions across more than one New Relic-monitored applications. Important Cross application tracing (CAT) has been deprecated and will be removed in a future major release. For cross-service visibility, we recommend using distributed tracing, which is enabled by default as of agent version 8.3.0. Before enabling, read the transition guide. Error message redaction variables The Node.js agent variables that control error message redaction appear in the allow_raw_exception_messages section of your app's newrelic.js configuration file: enabled Type Boolean Default true Environ variable NEW_RELIC_ALLOW_RAW_EXCEPTION_MESSAGES_ENABLED When false, the agent will redact the messages of captured errors. Distributed tracing Important Enabling distributed tracing disables cross application tracing, and has effects on other APM features. Before enabling, read the transition guide. Requires Node.js agent version 4.7.0 or higher. Distributed tracing lets you see the path that a request takes as it travels through a distributed system. When configuring via the config file, place the following option in the distributed_tracing section. enabled Type Boolean Default true Environ variable NEW_RELIC_DISTRIBUTED_TRACING_ENABLED Set this to true to enable distributed tracing. For example, to enable this in the config file, you would use: distributed_tracing: { enabled: true } Copy exclude_newrelic_header Type Boolean Default false Set this to true to exclude the New Relic header that is attached to outbound requests, and instead only rely on W3C Trace Context Headers for distributed tracing. If this is false then both types of headers are used. For example, to enable this in the config file, you would use: distributed_tracing:{ enabled: true, exclude_newrelic_header: true } Copy Span events Span data is reported for distributed tracing. Distributed tracing must be enabled to report spans. Span configuration is set in the span_events stanza. Options include: enabled Type Boolean Default true Environ variable NEW_RELIC_SPAN_EVENTS_ENABLED Turns reporting of span events on or off. attributes.enabled Type Boolean Default true Environ variable NEW_RELIC_SPAN_EVENTS_ATTRIBUTES_ENABLED This setting can be used to turn reporting of attributes on or off for spans. If attributes.enabled at the root level is false, no attributes will be sent with spans regardless on how this is set. attributes.include Type Array Default [] Environ variable NEW_RELIC_SPAN_EVENTS_ATTRIBUTES_INCLUDE If attributes are enabled for spans, all attribute keys found in this list will be attached to spans. For more information, see the agent attribute rules. attributes.exclude Type Array Default [] Environ variable NEW_RELIC_SPAN_EVENTS_ATTRIBUTES_EXCLUDE All attribute keys found in this list will not be sent with spans. For more information, see the agent attribute rules. max_samples_stored Type Integer Default 2000 Environ variable NEW_RELIC_SPAN_EVENTS_MAX_SAMPLES_STORED Defines the maximum number of events the agent collects per minute. If there are more than this number, the agent collects a statistical sampling. We do not recommend configuring past 10k. The server will cap data at 10k per-minute. Infinite Tracing To turn on Infinite Tracing, enable distributed tracing (set distributed_tracing to enabled: true) and add the additional settings below. For an example, see Language agents: configure distributed tracing. trace_observer.host Type String Default (none) Environ variable NEW_RELIC_INFINITE_TRACING_TRACE_OBSERVER_HOST For help getting a valid Infinite Tracing trace observer host entry, see Find or create a trace observer endpoint.",

      "body": "Browser monitoring includes strict security measures to provide a robust, standalone product with browser monitoring features. Before you install the browser agent, make sure your system meets these requirements. Want to try out our browser monitoring? Create a New Relic account for free! No credit card required. Basic requirements To report data to browser, your application must at a minimum meet two basic requirements: The traffic to the application must be from clients able to load and execute browser JavaScript code and set cookies. Clients accessing the application must be able to send data to New Relic through HTTP requests. HTTPS is required for browser Pro features. Important Browsers that subscribe to a disconnect list or that use content filtering extensions such as AdBlock may not be able to send data to New Relic. For example, if you are using the Enhanced Tracking Prevention disconnect list for Mozilla Firefox 69.0 or higher, you will need to change the default configuration. Most typical browser applications meet these requirements. However, browser applications in restricted environments may have difficulty reporting data to New Relic; for example: Hybrid mobile applications Applications installed on unusual hardware, such as point-of-sale terminals or consumer appliances For more information, review the instrumentation for browser monitoring documentation, and verify end-user network access. Browser types Instrumentation is compatible with every browser type, including Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox, Microsoft Internet Explorer and Edge, and Apple Safari. The user interface is compatible with New Relic's supported browser versions. Exceptions Comments Paint timings The firstPaint and firstContentfulPaint attributes in BrowserInteraction, PageView, and PageViewTiming events are only compatible with: Chrome 60 or higher for desktop and mobile (Android webview and Chrome for Android) Opera 47 or higher for desktop Opera 44 or higher for Android mobile Samsung Internet for mobile AJAX AJAX timing features are not available with: Chrome for iPhone and iPad IE 7 and 8 PageAction events PageAction events require a browser that fully supports cross-domain XMLHttpRequests. Internet Explorer versions 9 and lower cannot record PageAction events. Learn more on querying your data. Session traces Session traces are reported only from browsers that support the Resource Timing Specification. SHA-256 New Relic can only monitor browsers that are compatible with SHA-256. APM agents You can deploy the browser agent for apps monitored by APM, or you can deploy the browser agent for your standalone apps. For more information, see the installation procedures. If you are deploying browser for an app using APM, make sure your agent supports browser monitoring: C SDK: Version 1.0.0 or higher Go: Version 2.5.0 or higher Java: Version 3.4.0 or higher .NET: Version 2.20.25.0 or higher Node.js: Version 1.4.0 or higher PHP: Version 4.4.5.35 or higher Python: Version 2.10.1.9 or higher Ruby: Version 3.7.0.177 or higher Supported frameworks The browser agent collects data on all front-end frameworks. However, the monitoring occurs on lower-level \"primitives\" that JavaScript frameworks use, so the level of detail collected by the instrumentation may vary depending on your specific framework. Exceptions Comments Zone.js If you're using AngularJS and you want to use our SPA monitoring features, note that Zone.js versions 0.6.18 to 0.6.24 are not compatible with browser. In all cases, the browser agent must be loaded before Zone.js to avoid errors. Cypress.io Browser is unable to properly instrument the open and send methods of requests when tests are run in Cypress. This will cause the following error to be thrown: Cannot set property 'status' of undefined Copy This will only affect customers running tests with the Browser agent present in their code. Production applications should not be affected. html2pdf.js This library is not compatible with our Pro+SPA agent due to the way this library wraps promises. If you're using this library, we recommend selecting the Pro agent type. Content Security Policy (CSP) considerations In order to obtain accurate browser performance metrics, browser requires the use of a small, inline JavaScript snippet. New Relic carefully reviews the inline JavaScript to prevent Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) and other potential vulnerabilities. Content Security Policy Level 2 adds restrictions to the types of JavaScript allowed, such as inline scripts. It also limits which domains can load scripts during page load. Important If your website does not allow any third-party hosted JavaScript to run, you must request a CSP exception via your organization’s standard procedures in order to install the browser monitoring agent. When requesting a CSP exception, follow your organization's standard procedures to contact your web or security team. The browser JavaScript agent requires the following CSP exceptions in order to run properly. Alternatively, you can add all of these exceptions to the fallback default-src directive (instead of script-src and connect-src). CSP exception Comments unsafe-inline Add to the script-src directive or to the fallback default-src directive. This is required because the agent is installed by including an inline script. https://js-agent.newrelic.com Add to the script-src directive or to the fallback default-src directive. This is where additional script files that the agent requires are hosted. https://bam.nr-data.net https://bam-cell.nr-data.net Important Add https://gov-bam.nr-data.net if you're using FedRAMP-compliant endpoints. Add to the script-src directive or to the fallback default-src directive. This is where the agent sends its collected data. One of the calls to this URL is a JSONP call, which means that the URL must be allowed as a script source. Add to the connect-src directive or to the fallback default-src directive. The connect-src directive affects the URLs that scripts can call (for example, using the XMLHttpRequest interface). If you have CSP restrictions specifically around this directive, then add this URL as an exception.",

      "body": "Browser uses a JavaScript snippet, also referred to as an \"agent,\" to instrument your app's webpages. The JavaScript collects data for browser monitoring. To install the browser agent, you can choose from a number of deployment options. If you don't have one already, create a New Relic account. It's free, forever. Enable browser monitoring Browser Pro+SPA is the default agent when you enable browser monitoring. This automatically gives you access to all of our browser monitoring features. For more information about the browser monitoring options, see Browser agent types in this document. To enable browser monitoring: Go to one.newrelic.com, select Browser, and then select Add more data. Follow the instructions in the UI to add browser monitoring to your app. Generate some traffic for your app, then wait a few minutes for data to appear in New Relic. Optional: After installation is complete and you are seeing data, go to the App settings page for additional agent configuration, or to change the browser agent type. It may take several minutes after enabling the browser monitoring agent before your webpage data appear in New Relic. If have problems, follow our troubleshooting tips. Deployment options No matter which option you use to deploy browser monitoring, the end result is the same: the browser monitoring JavaScript snippet (also referred to as the \"agent\") is inserted into your app pages. The method you select depends on your preferences and business needs. Enable an APM-monitored app When enabling browser monitoring, you can use an APM agent to automatically inject the browser monitoring JavaScript snippet for you. This is the easiest way to install the agent for an app that's already being monitored by APM. APM-monitored apps are listed on your APM Applications index. Enable with copy/paste When enabling browser monitoring, you can manually insert the JavaScript snippet into your app's webpages. The copy/paste option gives you control over the exact placement of our JavaScript snippet, which is required to monitor the webpage's performance. This is useful for: Standalone apps, static sites, and cached pages delivered by CDN APM apps that are not as closely coupled to the browser app as with a standard server-side app (for example, when your client-side app talks to a REST API back end) Some tips for using the JavaScript snippet: Placement in your webpage: Copy the code snippet, then paste it inline into your pages as close to the top of the <head> element as possible, but after any position-sensitive <meta> tags (for example, X-UA-Compatible or charset information). For more information on the inline head placement, see JavaScript placement requirements. License key and app ID: Near the bottom of the generated JavaScript is your browser license key and application ID. This is useful with the REST API and API Explorer. Instrument webpages using the APM agent This information applies to apps that are also monitored by APM. Our APM agents can instrument webpages with the required JavaScript for page load timing. If you are using an APM agent's API to manually add the JavaScript snippet to your webpages, insert the instrumentation snippet as close to the top as possible. This allows you to take advantage of detailed information about browser's AJAX calls and JavaScript errors. For more information, see the instructions for your APM agent: C SDK Go Java .NET Node.js PHP Python Ruby Use REST API This information applies to apps that are also monitored by APM. The REST API lets you manage deployment outside the browser monitoring UI. This is useful for large organizations deploying multiple apps. Browser agent types: Lite, Pro, Pro+SPA We have three types of browser agents: Lite, Pro, and Pro+SPA. The agent type has no impact on your billing. Browser agent type Comparison Pro+SPA This is the default installed agent when you enable browser monitoring. What it includes: Gives you access to all of the Browser Pro features and to Single Page App (SPA) monitoring. Provides detailed page timing data and the most up-to-date New Relic features, including distributed tracing, for all types of applications. Pro+SPA is not limited only to single page applications. After install, you can downgrade anytime to the less advanced agents if you don't want or need SPA monitoring. Pro What it includes: Gives you access to the Browser Pro features. What it doesn't include: Lacks the functionality designed for single page app monitoring. Lite What it includes: Gives you information about some basic page load timing and browser user information. What it doesn't include: Lacks the Browser Pro features and SPA features. Details about how agent types relate to pricing: New Relic One pricing: This pricing plan has data ingest as a billing factor. If you want to reduce data ingest, you may want to consider downgrading to lesser agent types after install. Original pricing: Your access to browser monitoring features is gated by your subscription plan, not by the agent type. This means there is no reason not to use the default Pro+SPA agent. After initial agent installation is finished, you can go to the App settings page to edit your configuration or to change your subscription.",

      "body": "You can tailor the Node.js agent to your app's requirements by editing your newrelic.js config file or by setting an environment variable. The config file resides in the root directory of your app. You can also configure a few options from New Relic, or use the Node.js agent API. Important The license_key setting is required. We highly recommend setting the app_name so that your app has a meaningful name instead of the default My Application. Configuration methods and precedence The primary method to configure the Node.js agent is the agent configuration file (newrelic.js). You can also configure most settings with environment variables. You can also adjust some settings with server-side configuration. The Node.js agent uses this order of precedence for configuration methods: Node.js configuration hierarchy: Server-side configuration settings override environment variables. Environment variables override the agent config file. The config file overrides the agent defaults. Here are detailed descriptions of each configuration method: Agent configuration file The config file (newrelic.js) contains every Node.js agent setting. When you install the Node.js agent, you must copy newrelic.js into your app's root directory. Most settings are empty by default; they inherit their values from config/default.js. Environment variables Most configuration settings in newrelic.js have equivalent environment variables. These are useful, for example, if your agent runs in a PaaS environment such as Heroku or Microsoft Azure. Node.js agent environment variables always start with NEW_RELIC_. Where available, these environment variables are documented below under individual config options as the Environ variable. There are also two rarely used settings that can only be configured via environment variables. Server-side configuration Owners and Admins can view and configure a few settings directly in New Relic. Where available, the UI labels for server-side config are listed in this document under individual config options as the Server-side label. Exports variables This section defines the Node.js agent variables in the order they typically appear in the exports.config = { section of your app's newrelic.js configuration file. app_name (REQUIRED) Type String Default \"My Application\" Environ variable NEW_RELIC_APP_NAME The name New Relic uses to identify your app. For example, app_name: ['MyNodeApp']. To use multiple names for your app, specify a comma-delimited list of names. Data for all applications with the same name will be merged in the New Relic UI, so set this carefully. We highly recommend that you replace the default name with a descriptive name to avoid confusion and unintended aggregation of data. Tip For Azure users, the Node.js agent will use APP_POOL_ID if it is set, so you can use the name you chose for your Azure Web Server without setting it twice. license_key (REQUIRED) Type String Default (none) Environ variable NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY This setting is required. Your New Relic license key. For example, license_key: '40HexadecimalCharacters'. agent_enabled Type Boolean Default true Environ variable NEW_RELIC_ENABLED Set to false to stop the agent from starting up. This is useful when debugging your code requires temporarily disabling the agent. It prevents the agent from bootstrapping its instrumentation or setting up all its pieces, which prevents the agent from starting up and connecting to New Relic's servers. allow_all_headers If true, enables capture of all HTTP headers, except for those filtered by exclude rules. If false, collected headers are limited to those defined in Node.js agent attributes. Type Boolean Default false Caution Any header-related include/exclude rules must be in camelCase form to be filtered. apdex_t (DEPRECATED) Type Number Default 0.100 Server-side label Apdex T Set your Apdex T via the New Relic UI. certificates Type Array of strings Default (none) Additional certificates to trust for SSL connections, specified as an array of strings in PEM format. This affects both connections to an HTTPS proxy and connections to New Relic. Tip You can also configure the agent to read its certificates from a file: certificates: [ fs.readFileSync('myca.crt', {encoding: 'utf8'}) ] Copy high_security Type Boolean Default false Environ variable NEW_RELIC_HIGH_SECURITY When set to true, enables high security v2. You must also enable the ssl setting and enable high security in the UI. host Type String Default collector.newrelic.com Environ variable NEW_RELIC_HOST Important Do not edit this value unless New Relic Support asks you to change it. Hostname for the New Relic collector to connect to the Internet; for example, host: 'collector.newrelic.com'. labels Adds tags. Specify your tags as objects or a semicolon-delimited string of colon-separated pairs (for example, Server:One;Data Center:Primary). Type Object or string Default (none) Environ variable NEW_RELIC_LABELS port Type Integer Default 443 Environ variable NEW_RELIC_PORT Important Do not edit this value unless New Relic Support asks you to change it. Port number to connect to the New Relic collector; for example, port: 443. proxy Type String Default (none) Environ variable NEW_RELIC_PROXY_URL A URL specifying the proxy server to connect to the Internet. For example, proxy: 'http://user:pass@10.0.0.1:8000/'. Important The proxy config file setting overrides the other config file proxy settings (proxy_host, proxy_port, proxy_user, proxy_pass) if used. Similarly, the NEW_RELIC_PROXY_URL environment variable overrides the other environment variable proxy settings (NEW_RELIC_PROXY_HOST, NEW_RELIC_PROXY_PORT, NEW_RELIC_PROXY_USER, and NEW_RELIC_PROXY_PASS) if used. proxy_host Type String Default (none) Environ variable NEW_RELIC_PROXY_HOST Hostname or IP address of the proxy server to connect to the Internet. proxy_pass Type String Default (none) Environ variable NEW_RELIC_PROXY_PASS Password for authenticating to the proxy server. The agent supports only basic HTTP authentication. proxy_port Type String Default (none) Environ variable NEW_RELIC_PROXY_PORT Port number of the proxy server to connect to the Internet. proxy_user Type String Default (none) Environ variable NEW_RELIC_PROXY_USER User name for authenticating to the proxy server. The agent supports only basic HTTP authentication. Logging variables This section defines the Node.js agent variables in the order they typically appear in the logging: { section of your app's newrelic.js configuration file. enabled Type String Default true (false in serverless_mode) Environ variable NEW_RELIC_LOG_ENABLED Enables or disables agent specific logging. level Type String Default info Environ variable NEW_RELIC_LOG_LEVEL Defines the level of detail recorded in the agent logs. From least detail to most detail, possible values are fatal, error, warn, info, debug, or trace. Caution Do not use debug or trace logging unless New Relic Support asks you to use them. These levels of logging can generate excessive overhead. For most situations, use info. filepath Type String Default process.cwd() plus newrelic_agent.log Environ variable NEW_RELIC_LOG Complete path to the New Relic agent log, including the filename. Defaults to filepath: require('path').join(process.cwd(), 'newrelic_agent.log'). The agent will shut down the process if it cannot create this file. The agent creates a log file with the same permissions as the parent Node.js agent process. To write all logging to stdout, set this to stdout. To write all logging to stderr, set this to stderr. Audit logging This section defines the Node.js agent variables in the order they typically appear in the audit_log: { section of your app's newrelic.js configuration file. enabled Type Boolean Default false Environ variable NEW_RELIC_AUDIT_LOG_ENABLED When enabled, the agent logs the payloads it sends to the collector. This data is included in the main log file even when logging level is set to the lowest level. endpoints Type Array Default Empty array (include all types) Environ variable NEW_RELIC_AUDIT_LOG_ENDPOINTS The agent sends several different types of data to the collector in separate payloads. By default, all of them are included in the log file. This option makes it possible to limit logging only to specific types of data. Valid values include: agent_settings analytic_event_data connect custom_event_data error_data error_event_data metric_data preconnect shutdown span_event_data sql_trace_data transaction_sample_data API configuration This section allows you to choose which API methods are enabled. Each configuration option allows you to modularly enable API methods that are responsible for sending custom information to New Relic. Important All of these are set to false when the agent is in high security mode. custom_attributes_enabled Type Boolean Default true Environ variable NEW_RELIC_API_CUSTOM_ATTRIBUTES This option enables newrelic.addCustomAttribute and newrelic.addCustomAttributes. custom_events_enabled Type Boolean Default true Environ variable NEW_RELIC_API_CUSTOM_EVENTS This option enables recordCustomEvent. notice_error_enabled Type Boolean Default true Environ variable NEW_RELIC_API_NOTICE_ERROR This option enables newrelic.noticeError. Attributes This section defines the variables for Node.js agent attributes in the order they typically appear in the attributes: { section of your app's newrelic.js configuration file. Caution Any header-related include/exclude rules must be in camelCase form to be filtered. enabled Type Boolean Default true Environ variable NEW_RELIC_ATTRIBUTES_ENABLED If true, enables capture of attributes for all destinations. exclude Type Array Default [] Environ variable NEW_RELIC_ATTRIBUTES_EXCLUDE Prefix of attributes to exclude from all destinations. Allows * as wildcard at end. include Type Array Default [] Environ variable NEW_RELIC_ATTRIBUTES_INCLUDE Prefix of attributes to include from all destinations. Allows * as wildcard at end. include_enabled Type Boolean Default true Environ variable NEW_RELIC_ATTRIBUTES_INCLUDE_ENABLED When true, patterns may be added to the attributes.include list. Error collector variables You can manage how error are handled in New Relic. This section defines the Node.js agent variables in the order they typically appear in the error_collector: { section of your app's newrelic.js configuration file. enabled Type Boolean Default true Environ variable NEW_RELIC_ERROR_COLLECTOR_ENABLED Server-side label Enable error collection? When enabled, the agent collects error traces from your app. ignore_status_codes Type Array Default 404 Environ variable NEW_RELIC_ERROR_COLLECTOR_IGNORE_ERROR_CODES Server-side label Ignore these status codes Comma-delimited list of HTTP status codes for the error collector to ignore. Caution Errors recorded using newrelic.noticeError do not obey this configuration value. ignore_classes Type Array|Object Default [] Environ variable NEW_RELIC_ERROR_COLLECTOR_IGNORE_ERRORS Comma-delimited list of javascript error types/classes for the error collector to ignore. The following configuration /* ... */ error_collector: { ignore_classes: [\"ReferenceError\"] } /* ... */ Copy Would ignore all reference errors. Caution Errors recorded using newrelic.noticeError do not obey this configuration value. ignore_messages Type Object Default {} A javascript object describing a list of javascript classes tied to javascript error messages for the collector to ignore. The following configuration. /* ... */ error_collector: { /* ... */ ignore_messages: {\"Error\":[\"Undefined\", \"Out of time\"]} /* ... */ } /* ... */ Copy Would ignore all errors of type Error, with the exact (case-sensitive) message strings of Undefined and Out of time. Caution Errors recorded using newrelic.noticeError do not obey this configuration value. expected_status_codes Type Array Default [] Environ variable NEW_RELIC_ERROR_COLLECTOR_EXPECTED_ERROR_CODES Comma-delimited list of HTTP status codes for the error collector to mark as expected. Caution Errors recorded using newrelic.noticeError do not obey this configuration value. expected_classes Type Array Default [] Environ variable NEW_RELIC_ERROR_COLLECTOR_EXPECTED_ERRORS The following configuration /* ... */ error_collector: { expected_classes: [\"ReferenceError\"] } /* ... */ Copy Would mark all reference errors as expected. Caution Errors recorded using newrelic.noticeError do not obey this configuration value. expected_messages Type Object Default {} A javascript object describing a list of javascript classes tied to javascript error messages for the collector to ignore. The following configuration. /* ... */ error_collector: { /* ... */ expected_messages: {\"Error\":[\"Undefined\", \"Out of time\"]} /* ... */ } /* ... */ Copy Would mark all errors of type Error, with the exact (case-sensitive) message strings of Undefined and Out of time. Caution Errors recorded using newrelic.noticeError do not obey this configuration value. attributes.enabled Type Boolean Default true Environ variable NEW_RELIC_ERROR_COLLECTOR_ATTRIBUTES_ENABLED If true, the agent captures attributes from error collection. Caution Any header-related include/exclude rules must be in camelCase form to be filtered. attributes.exclude Type Array Default [] Environ variable NEW_RELIC_ERROR_COLLECTOR_ATTRIBUTES_EXCLUDE Prefix of attributes to exclude from error collection. Allows * as wildcard at end. attributes.include Type Array Default [] Environ variable NEW_RELIC_ERROR_COLLECTOR_ATTRIBUTES_INCLUDE Prefix of attributes to include in error collection. Allows * as wildcard at end. max_event_samples_stored Type Integer Default 100 Environ variable NEW_RELIC_ERROR_COLLECTOR_MAX_EVENT_SAMPLES_STORED Defines the maximum number of events the agent collects per minute. If there are more than this number, the agent collects a statistical sampling. Transaction tracer variables The agent groups your requests into transactions, which are used to: Visualize where your app spends its time (in transaction breakdowns). Identify slow requests. Group metrics. Isolate other issues, such as slow database performance. This section defines the Node.js agent variables in the order they typically appear in the transaction_tracer: { section of your app's newrelic.js configuration file. Important Do not use brackets [suffix] at the end of your transaction name. New Relic automatically strips brackets from the name. Instead, use parentheses (suffix) or other symbols if needed. enabled Type Boolean Default true Environ variable NEW_RELIC_TRACER_ENABLED Server-side label Enable transaction tracing? When enabled, the agent collects slow transaction traces. explain_threshold Type Integer Default 500 Environ variable NEW_RELIC_EXPLAIN_THRESHOLD Minimum query duration (in milliseconds) for a transaction to be eligible for slow queries in transaction traces. record_sql Type String (off, obfuscated, or raw) Default off Environ variable NEW_RELIC_RECORD_SQL This option affects both slow queries and record_sql for transaction traces. It can have one of three values: off, obfuscated, or raw. When set to off no slow queries will be captured, and backtraces and SQL will not be included in transaction traces. If set to raw or obfuscated, the agent sends raw or obfuscated SQL and a slow query sample to the collector. The agent may also send SQL when other criteria are met, such as when slow_sql.enabled is set. top_n Type Integer Default 20 Environ variable NEW_RELIC_TRACER_TOP_N Defines the maximum number of requests eligible for transaction traces. Transactions are named based on the request, and top_n refers to the \"top n slowest transactions\" grouped by these names. The module replaces a recorded trace with a new trace only if the new trace is slower than the previous slowest trace of that name. The default value for this setting is top_n: 20, because the Transactions page also defaults to the 20 slowest transactions. The Node.js agent captures at least five different slow transactions in the first harvest cycle after start up. It will also reset and capture different transactions if no slow transactions have been captured for the last five harvest cycles. This allows you to see more information about more of your app's request paths, at the possible cost of not focusing on the absolutely slowest request for that harvest cycle. Tip To record the absolute slowest transaction over the last minute, you can set top_n: 0 or top_n: 1. However, this causes one very slow route to dominate your transaction traces. transaction_threshold Type Integer or apdex_f Default apdex_f Environ variable NEW_RELIC_TRACER_THRESHOLD Server-side label Threshold Threshold of web transaction response time in seconds beyond which a transaction is eligible for transaction tracing. The default value is apdex_f; this sets the trace threshold to four times your application's Apdex T. You can also enter a specific time value in milliseconds. Example: Threshold set to apdex_f The default apdex_t is 100 milliseconds. If your transaction threshold is set to apdex_f, a \"slow\" transaction is 400 milliseconds. hide_internals Type boolean Default true Environ variable NEW_RELIC_HIDE_INTERNALS The agent uses a small amount of CPU in order to hide internal properties that are attached to the web application. If you change this configuration to false, it may slightly decrease your agent overhead, but it could also have an impact on the performance of the agent. attributes.enabled Type Boolean Default true Environ variable NEW_RELIC_TRANSACTION_TRACER_ATTRIBUTES_ENABLED If true, the agent captures attributes from transaction traces. Caution Any header-related include/exclude rules must be in camelCase form to be filtered. attributes.exclude Type Array Default [] Environ variable NEW_RELIC_TRANSACTION_TRACER_ATTRIBUTES_EXCLUDE Prefix of attributes to exclude from transaction traces. Allows * as wildcard at end. attributes.include Type Array Default [] Environ variable NEW_RELIC_TRANSACTION_TRACER_ATTRIBUTES_INCLUDE Prefix of attributes to include in transaction traces. Allows * as wildcard at end. Rules variables This section defines the Node.js agent variables in the order they typically appear in the rules: { section of your app's newrelic.js configuration file. name Type Strings or regular expressions Default (none) Environ variable NEW_RELIC_NAMING_RULES A comma-delimited list of rules to match incoming request URLs and name the associated New Relic transaction. Uses the format: name: [ {pattern: 'STRING_OR_REGEX', name: 'NAME'}, {pattern: 'STRING_OR_REGEX', name: 'NAME'} ], Copy Both parameters are required. For strings, you must escape control characters. You do not need to escape control characters in regular expressions. Additional attributes are ignored. Regular expressions support JavaScript-style capture groups, and names use $1-style replacement strings. Regular expressions only find the first matching result; subsequent matches are ignored. For more information, see Node.js transaction naming API. For the NEW_RELIC_NAMING_RULES environment variable, pass the rules as comma-delimited JSON object literals: NEW_RELIC_NAMING_RULES='{\"pattern\":\"^t\",\"name\":\"u\"},{\"pattern\":\"^u\",\"name\":\"t\"}' Copy ignore Type Strings or regular expressions Default Regular expression to match socket.io long-polling requests (\"^ \\ /socket \\ .io \\ /. * \\ /xhr-polling/\"). Environ variable NEW_RELIC_IGNORING_RULES Define a list of request URLs you want the agent to ignore. Specify the list as patterns, which can be strings or regular expressions. enforce_backstop Type Boolean Default true Environ variable NEW_RELIC_ENFORCE_BACKSTOP Caution Do not change this setting unless you understand metric grouping issues. When enabled, the agent renames transactions that are not affected by other naming logic (such as the API, rules, or metric normalization rules) to NormalizedUri/*. If you set this to false, the agent sets transaction names to Uri/path/to/resource. Transaction events variables This section defines the Node.js agent variables in the order they typically appear in the transaction_events: { section of your app's newrelic.js configuration file. enabled Type Boolean Default true When enabled, the agent sends transaction events to New Relic. This event data includes transaction timing, transaction name, and any custom parameters. If this is disabled, the agent does not collect this data or send it to New Relic. max_samples_stored Type Integer Default 10000 Environ variable NEW_RELIC_TRANSACTION_EVENTS_MAX_SAMPLES_STORED Defines the maximum number of events the agent collects per minute. If there are more than this number, the agent collects a statistical sampling. We do not recommend configuring past 10,000. The server will cap data at 10,000 per-minute. Important This configuration had different behavior in agent versions lower than 6.0.0. See max_samples_stored (DEPRECATED) for agent versions 5.x or lower. max_samples_stored (DEPRECATED) Type Integer Default 20000 Defines the maximum number of events the agent stores if it is unable to communicate with the New Relic collector. The values from the previous harvest cycle will be merged into the next one, with this option limiting the maximum number. Make sure this number is greater than max_samples_per_minute; for example, set it to twice as much. Consider your memory overhead before increasing this value. Caution This configuration has different behavior starting with agent version 6.0.0 and a new recommended maximum. See max_samples_stored for agent versions 6.x or higher. max_samples_per_minute (DEPRECATED) Type Integer Default 10000 Defines the maximum number of events the agent collects per minute. If there are more than this number, the agent collects a statistical sampling. Caution This configuration has been replaced with max_samples_stored starting with version 6.0.0 of the agent. See max_samples_stored for 6.x or later agents. attributes.enabled Type Boolean Default true Environ variable NEW_RELIC_TRANSACTION_EVENTS_ATTRIBUTES_ENABLED If true, the agent captures attributes from transaction events. Caution Any header-related include/exclude rules must be in camelCase form to be filtered. attributes.exclude Type Array Default [] Environ variable NEW_RELIC_TRANSACTION_EVENTS_ATTRIBUTES_EXCLUDE Prefix of attributes to exclude from transaction events. Allows * as wildcard at end. attributes.include Type Array Default [] Environ variable NEW_RELIC_TRANSACTION_EVENTS_ATTRIBUTES_INCLUDE Prefix of attributes to include in transaction events. Allows * as wildcard at end. Browser monitoring variables This section defines the Node.js agent variables in the order they typically appear in the browser_monitoring: { section of your app's newrelic.js configuration file. enable Type Boolean Default true Environ variable NEW_RELIC_BROWSER_MONITOR_ENABLE Server-side label Enable browser monitoring? Generate JavaScript headers for browser instrumentation. Although this defaults to true, the agent doesn't inject the browser JS code unless you have enabled browser monitoring. Even if you have enabled it and added the browser timing header, you can disable browser monitoring for your app by setting this to false. debug Type Boolean Default false Environ variable NEW_RELIC_BROWSER_MONITOR_DEBUG If true, request un-minified sources from the server. attributes.enabled Type Boolean Default false Environ variable NEW_RELIC_BROWSER_MONITORING_ATTRIBUTES_ENABLED If true, the agent sends custom attributes to browser monitoring. Caution Any header-related include/exclude rules must be in camelCase form to be filtered. attributes.exclude Type Array Default [] Environ variable NEW_RELIC_BROWSER_MONITORING_ATTRIBUTES_EXCLUDE Prefix of attributes to exclude from browser monitoring. Allows * as wildcard at end. attributes.include Type Array Default [] Environ variable NEW_RELIC_BROWSER_MONITORING_ATTRIBUTES_INCLUDE Prefix of attributes to include in browser monitoring. Allows * as wildcard at end. Custom events variables This section defines the Node.js agent variables in the order they typically appear in the custom_insights_events: { section of your app's newrelic.js configuration file. Currently there are no environment variables for custom events. enabled Type Boolean Default true When enabled, the agent sends custom events recorded with recordCustomEvent() to New Relic. If this is disabled, the agent does not collect this data or send it to New Relic. max_samples_stored Type Integer Default 1000 Environ variable NEW_RELIC_CUSTOM_INSIGHTS_EVENTS_MAX_SAMPLES_STORED Defines the maximum number of custom events the agent collects per minute. If the number of custom events exceeds this limit, the agent collects a statistical sampling. Important Increasing this limit increases memory usage. Slow queries variables This section defines the Node.js agent variables in the order they typically appear in the slow_sql: { section of your app's newrelic.js configuration file. These options control behavior for slow queries, but do not affect SQL nodes in transaction traces. enabled Type Boolean Default false Environ variable NEW_RELIC_SLOW_SQL_ENABLED When enabled, the agent collects slow query details. max_samples Type Integer Default 10 Environ variable NEW_RELIC_MAX_SQL_SAMPLES Defines the maximum number of slow queries the agent collects per minute. The agent discards additional queries after the limit is reached. Important Increasing this limit increases memory usage. Custom hostname variables This section defines the Node.js agent variables in the order they typically appear in the process_host: { section of your app's newrelic.js configuration file. These options control behavior regarding the host display name in the APM UI. display_name Type String of 255 bytes or less Default (none) Environ variable NEW_RELIC_PROCESS_HOST_DISPLAY_NAME Specify a custom hostname for display in New Relic. If you do not set this field, New Relic will continue to use the default hostname found by calling os.hostname(). If you use the default hostname settings, New Relic finds the hostname through os.hostname(). If this call fails, New Relic uses the host's IP as the name. If you set ipv_preference: 4 or ipv_preference: 6, you can select the type of IP address (IPv4 or IPv6) that appears in the New Relic UI. ipv_preference Type Integer (4 or 6) Default 4 Environ variable NEW_RELIC_IPV_PREFERENCE Environment variable overrides This section defines two configuration options only available with environment variables. These overrides are not used in most configurations. NEW_RELIC_HOME Path to the directory containing newrelic.js. This is available only as an environment variable. You cannot set it in your config file. Type String Default (none) NEW_RELIC_NO_CONFIG_FILE If used, this prevents the agent from reading configuration settings from newrelic.js. Default values and values from environment variables will still be set. This is available only as an environment variable. You cannot set it in your config file. Type Boolean Default False Datastore tracer variables This section defines the Node.js agent variables in the order they typically appear in the datastore_tracer section of your app's newrelic.js configuration file. These options control behavior for collecting datastore instance metrics. instance_reporting.enabled Type Boolean Default true When enabled, the agent collects datastore instance metrics (such as host and port) for some database drivers. These are reported on slow query traces and transaction traces. database_name_reporting.enabled Type Boolean Default true When enabled, the agent collects database name on slow query traces and transaction traces for some database drivers. Cross application tracing (DEPRECATED) The Node.js agent variables that control cross application tracing typically appear in the cross_application_tracer section of your app's newrelic.js configuration file: enabled Type Boolean Default false When set to true, allows tracing of transactions across more than one New Relic-monitored applications. Important Cross application tracing (CAT) has been deprecated and will be removed in a future major release. For cross-service visibility, we recommend using distributed tracing, which is enabled by default as of agent version 8.3.0. Before enabling, read the transition guide. Error message redaction variables The Node.js agent variables that control error message redaction appear in the allow_raw_exception_messages section of your app's newrelic.js configuration file: enabled Type Boolean Default true Environ variable NEW_RELIC_ALLOW_RAW_EXCEPTION_MESSAGES_ENABLED When false, the agent will redact the messages of captured errors. Distributed tracing Important Enabling distributed tracing disables cross application tracing, and has effects on other APM features. Before enabling, read the transition guide. Requires Node.js agent version 4.7.0 or higher. Distributed tracing lets you see the path that a request takes as it travels through a distributed system. When configuring via the config file, place the following option in the distributed_tracing section. enabled Type Boolean Default true Environ variable NEW_RELIC_DISTRIBUTED_TRACING_ENABLED Set this to true to enable distributed tracing. For example, to enable this in the config file, you would use: distributed_tracing: { enabled: true } Copy exclude_newrelic_header Type Boolean Default false Set this to true to exclude the New Relic header that is attached to outbound requests, and instead only rely on W3C Trace Context Headers for distributed tracing. If this is false then both types of headers are used. For example, to enable this in the config file, you would use: distributed_tracing:{ enabled: true, exclude_newrelic_header: true } Copy Span events Span data is reported for distributed tracing. Distributed tracing must be enabled to report spans. Span configuration is set in the span_events stanza. Options include: enabled Type Boolean Default true Environ variable NEW_RELIC_SPAN_EVENTS_ENABLED Turns reporting of span events on or off. attributes.enabled Type Boolean Default true Environ variable NEW_RELIC_SPAN_EVENTS_ATTRIBUTES_ENABLED This setting can be used to turn reporting of attributes on or off for spans. If attributes.enabled at the root level is false, no attributes will be sent with spans regardless on how this is set. attributes.include Type Array Default [] Environ variable NEW_RELIC_SPAN_EVENTS_ATTRIBUTES_INCLUDE If attributes are enabled for spans, all attribute keys found in this list will be attached to spans. For more information, see the agent attribute rules. attributes.exclude Type Array Default [] Environ variable NEW_RELIC_SPAN_EVENTS_ATTRIBUTES_EXCLUDE All attribute keys found in this list will not be sent with spans. For more information, see the agent attribute rules. max_samples_stored Type Integer Default 2000 Environ variable NEW_RELIC_SPAN_EVENTS_MAX_SAMPLES_STORED Defines the maximum number of events the agent collects per minute. If there are more than this number, the agent collects a statistical sampling. We do not recommend configuring past 10k. The server will cap data at 10k per-minute. Infinite Tracing To turn on Infinite Tracing, enable distributed tracing (set distributed_tracing to enabled: true) and add the additional settings below. For an example, see Language agents: configure distributed tracing. trace_observer.host Type String Default (none) Environ variable NEW_RELIC_INFINITE_TRACING_TRACE_OBSERVER_HOST For help getting a valid Infinite Tracing trace observer host entry, see Find or create a trace observer endpoint.",

      "body": "Browser monitoring includes strict security measures to provide a robust, standalone product with browser monitoring features. Before you install the browser agent, make sure your system meets these requirements. Want to try out our browser monitoring? Create a New Relic account for free! No credit card required. Basic requirements To report data to browser, your application must at a minimum meet two basic requirements: The traffic to the application must be from clients able to load and execute browser JavaScript code and set cookies. Clients accessing the application must be able to send data to New Relic through HTTP requests. HTTPS is required for browser Pro features. Important Browsers that subscribe to a disconnect list or that use content filtering extensions such as AdBlock may not be able to send data to New Relic. For example, if you are using the Enhanced Tracking Prevention disconnect list for Mozilla Firefox 69.0 or higher, you will need to change the default configuration. Most typical browser applications meet these requirements. However, browser applications in restricted environments may have difficulty reporting data to New Relic; for example: Hybrid mobile applications Applications installed on unusual hardware, such as point-of-sale terminals or consumer appliances For more information, review the instrumentation for browser monitoring documentation, and verify end-user network access. Browser types Instrumentation is compatible with every browser type, including Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox, Microsoft Internet Explorer and Edge, and Apple Safari. The user interface is compatible with New Relic's supported browser versions. Exceptions Comments Paint timings The firstPaint and firstContentfulPaint attributes in BrowserInteraction, PageView, and PageViewTiming events are only compatible with: Chrome 60 or higher for desktop and mobile (Android webview and Chrome for Android) Opera 47 or higher for desktop Opera 44 or higher for Android mobile Samsung Internet for mobile AJAX AJAX timing features are not available with: Chrome for iPhone and iPad IE 7 and 8 PageAction events PageAction events require a browser that fully supports cross-domain XMLHttpRequests. Internet Explorer versions 9 and lower cannot record PageAction events. Learn more on querying your data. Session traces Session traces are reported only from browsers that support the Resource Timing Specification. SHA-256 New Relic can only monitor browsers that are compatible with SHA-256. APM agents You can deploy the browser agent for apps monitored by APM, or you can deploy the browser agent for your standalone apps. For more information, see the installation procedures. If you are deploying browser for an app using APM, make sure your agent supports browser monitoring: C SDK: Version 1.0.0 or higher Go: Version 2.5.0 or higher Java: Version 3.4.0 or higher .NET: Version 2.20.25.0 or higher Node.js: Version 1.4.0 or higher PHP: Version 4.4.5.35 or higher Python: Version 2.10.1.9 or higher Ruby: Version 3.7.0.177 or higher Supported frameworks The browser agent collects data on all front-end frameworks. However, the monitoring occurs on lower-level \"primitives\" that JavaScript frameworks use, so the level of detail collected by the instrumentation may vary depending on your specific framework. Exceptions Comments Zone.js If you're using AngularJS and you want to use our SPA monitoring features, note that Zone.js versions 0.6.18 to 0.6.24 are not compatible with browser. In all cases, the browser agent must be loaded before Zone.js to avoid errors. Cypress.io Browser is unable to properly instrument the open and send methods of requests when tests are run in Cypress. This will cause the following error to be thrown: Cannot set property 'status' of undefined Copy This will only affect customers running tests with the Browser agent present in their code. Production applications should not be affected. html2pdf.js This library is not compatible with our Pro+SPA agent due to the way this library wraps promises. If you're using this library, we recommend selecting the Pro agent type. Content Security Policy (CSP) considerations In order to obtain accurate browser performance metrics, browser requires the use of a small, inline JavaScript snippet. New Relic carefully reviews the inline JavaScript to prevent Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) and other potential vulnerabilities. Content Security Policy Level 2 adds restrictions to the types of JavaScript allowed, such as inline scripts. It also limits which domains can load scripts during page load. Important If your website does not allow any third-party hosted JavaScript to run, you must request a CSP exception via your organization’s standard procedures in order to install the browser monitoring agent. When requesting a CSP exception, follow your organization's standard procedures to contact your web or security team. The browser JavaScript agent requires the following CSP exceptions in order to run properly. Alternatively, you can add all of these exceptions to the fallback default-src directive (instead of script-src and connect-src). CSP exception Comments unsafe-inline Add to the script-src directive or to the fallback default-src directive. This is required because the agent is installed by including an inline script. https://js-agent.newrelic.com Add to the script-src directive or to the fallback default-src directive. This is where additional script files that the agent requires are hosted. https://bam.nr-data.net https://bam-cell.nr-data.net Important Add https://gov-bam.nr-data.net if you're using FedRAMP-compliant endpoints. Add to the script-src directive or to the fallback default-src directive. This is where the agent sends its collected data. One of the calls to this URL is a JSONP call, which means that the URL must be allowed as a script source. Add to the connect-src directive or to the fallback default-src directive. The connect-src directive affects the URLs that scripts can call (for example, using the XMLHttpRequest interface). If you have CSP restrictions specifically around this directive, then add this URL as an exception.",

      "body": "Browser monitoring's PageViewTiming event sends each data point as a separate event as soon as it is available. Because we do not restrict the timing, you can receive first paint or first interaction data regardless of when it fires. This document describes why and how to use PageViewTiming and its attributes to query data about your site, component loading, and user performance metrics, both from visual and responsiveness standpoints. Why use PageViewTiming? If your application uses asynchronous or dynamic pages, you may need additional details about site or component loading. But pages can load content in many different ways, and users control when they interact with that content. This is why some user-centric performance metrics happen outside the standard window onload (page load time) in the browser agent. For example, users may become impatient and begin clicking as soon as content is on the webpage. Or, they may wait to use the page until long after content is loaded. The PageViewTiming event provides a more real-time delivery mechanism that does not have a dependency on any other event. The additional metrics can help you understand how users experience your site, both from visual and responsiveness standpoints. Support for Google's Core Web Vitals We now, with the release of agent version 1177, have full support for Google's Core Web Vitals for 2020. The metrics that make up Core Web Vitals will evolve over time. The current set for 2020 focuses on three aspects of the user experience—loading, interactivity, and visual stability—and includes the following metrics (and their respective thresholds): Core Web Vitals metrics include loading, interactivity, and visual stability. Largest Contentful Paint (LCP): measures loading performance. To provide a good user experience, LCP should occur within 2.5 seconds of when the page first starts loading. First Input Delay (FID): measures interactivity. To provide a good user experience, pages should have a FID of less than 100 milliseconds. Cumulative Layout Shift (CLS): measures visual stability. To provide a good user experience, pages should maintain a CLS of less than 0.1. For each of the above metrics, to ensure you're hitting the recommended target for most of your users, a good threshold to measure is the 75th percentile of page loads, segmented across mobile and desktop devices. To learn more, watch our Nerd Days talk on perceived performance. Detailed visual, interactivity, and responsiveness metrics The BrowserInteraction and PageView events end their reporting when they receive the page window load (or window load and AJAX) timing. However, paint and interactivity metrics can happen at any time. PageViewTiming delivers these metrics as a separate event to: Account for the variability in this timing. Avoid setting an arbitrary timeout. Prevent holding BrowserInteraction and PageView events indefinitely. Additional data Comments firstPaint and firstContentfulPaint The firstPaint and firstContentfulPaint attributes already are available with BrowserInteraction and PageView events. However, they are not always reliably captured before the window onload event fires. Using PageViewTiming gives you a way to capture these metrics even if they happen after the original page load time. This gives you a better understanding of the correlation between responsiveness of that load event and the visual rendering of your content. largestContentfulPaint This new metric, available with agent version 1163, largestContentfulPaint, reports the render time of the largest content element visible in the viewport. Google's research found looking at when the largest element was rendered was a more accurate way to measure when the main content of a page is loaded and useful. Details on this metric, including limitations and considerations can be found in the w3c draft. In addition, we now report the cumulative layout shift (CLS) score attribute with LCP. This attribute is reported as cumulativeLayoutShift. Largest Contentful Paint is one of three metrics identified by Google as the Core Web Vitals. LCP values up to 2.5 secs are considered \"Good\", between 2.5-4.0 secs considered \"Needs Improvement\", and above 4.0 secs considered \"Poor.\" firstInteraction and firstInputDelay With the addition of firstInteraction and firstInputDelay, you can quickly determine the ways that your users are interacting with that visual content. These metrics tell you not only when they interacted, but what type of interaction (mousedown, pointerdown, etc.) and how long it took for them to receive a response from your site. The firstInputDelay metric lies in the middle of FirstContentfulPaint and Time to Interactive (TTI) metrics, measuring the time between when a first input can be made and when the browser's main thread is able to respond to any interactions. In addition, we now report the cumulative layout shift (CLS) score attribute at the moment of the user's first interaction. This attribute is reported as cumulativeLayoutShift. First Input Delay is one of three metrics identified by Google as the Core Web Vitals. FID values up to 100 ms are considered \"Good\", between 100-300 ms considered \"Needs Improvement\", and above 300 ms considered \"Poor.\" For a more detailed explanation, see the Browser release notes. cumulativeLayoutShift Cumulative Layout Shift (CLS), available with agent v1177, is an important, user-centric metric for measuring visual stability because it helps quantify how often users experience unexpected layout shifts—a low CLS helps ensure that the page is delightful. This is one of three metrics identified by Google as the Core Web Vitals. Cumulative Layout Shift is one of three metrics identified by Google as the Core Web Vitals. CLS scores up to 0.1 are considered \"Good\", between 0.1-0.25 considered \"Needs Improvement\", and above 0.25 considered \"Poor.\" timingName You can review different types of activities with the timingName attribute, such as firstPaint, firstContentfulPaint, firstInteraction, largestContentfulPaint, pageHide and windowUnload. For example, a PageViewTiming event may have a timingName of firstPaint and a firstPaint value of .03. The event will also include all default attributes included with the standard BrowserInteraction and PageView events. elementId This is the Id, if specified, of the largestContentfulPaint element. This value will only be reported with the LCP metric. This value can be null. elementSize This is the reported size of the largestContentfulPaint element. This value will only be reported with the LCP metric. pageHide The pageHide event, available with agent v1177, is sent when the browser hides the current page in the process of presenting a different page from the session's history. For example, when the user clicks the browser's Back button, the current page receives a pageHide event before the previous page is shown. Supporting documentation and browser compatibility for the pageHide event can be found in MDN docs. In addition, we now report the cumulative layout shift (CLS) score attribute with pageHide. This attribute is reported as cumulativeLayoutShift. windowLoad The windowLoad event, available with agent v1177, is fired when the whole page has loaded, including all dependent resources such as stylesheets and images. Supporting documentation and browser compatibility for the Window Load event can be found in MDN docs. In addition, we now report the cumulative layout shift (CLS) score attribute with windowLoad. This attribute is reported as cumulativeLayoutShift. windowUnload The windowUnload event, available with agent v1163, is fired when a document or child resource is being unloaded. Supporting documentation and browser compatibility for the Window Unload event can be found in MDN docs. In addition, we now report the cumulative layout shift (CLS) score attribute with windowUnload. This attribute is reported as cumulativeLayoutShift. Compatibility and requirements Requirements: Meets install requirements Reporting of this event requires browser agent version 1153 or higher and a Pro or Pro+SPA agent. Follow our Browser agent release notes to find out when new metrics are released. These metrics are supported by the following browser versions. For unsupported browsers, no PageViewTiming events will be recorded. Metrics Supported browser versions cumulativeLayoutShift Chrome 79 Metric is elevated to stable; changes in metric definition will be reported in this log. Chrome 77 Metric exposed via API: Cumulative Layout Shift available via Layout Instability API firstPaint firstContentfulPaint Chrome 60 or higher for desktop and mobile (Android webview and Chrome for Android) Opera 47 or higher for desktop Opera 44 or higher for Android mobile Samsung Internet for mobile largestContentfulPaint Chrome 77 or higher for desktop and mobile firstInteraction firstInputDelay These metrics require the addEventListener browser API. This API is available in all modern browsers, including: Apple Safari Google Chrome Microsoft Internet Explorer (IE) versions 9 or higher Mozilla Firefox pageHide This metric is currently supported by all browsers on desktop and mobile. Compatibility matrix via MDN documentation. windowLoad This metric is currently supported by all browsers on desktop and mobile.

If a user navigates from a site without page load timing to a site with page load timing (for example, to the first page on your page load timing-enabled site), special considerations for navigation start time arise. Contents Network estimate The page load timing JavaScript utility file creates a cookie with the navigation start time when a user leaves a page (by hooking an event, beforeunload, or pagehide, depending on the browser). However, when navigating away from a site without page load timing enabled, the JavaScript code will not be present, and the cookie will not be created. Then, when the user hits the first page of a site, the navigation start time cannot be determined, because there is no cookie. In this case the browser agent has all the data (queue time, app time, DOM content and rendering time) except network time. Navigation start time is required to compute network time. Rather than toss the data, the page load timing feature estimates the network time based on recently accumulated averages for your application, regionally. This way the page load timing feature provides a more accurate throughput measurement, and the rest of the data is retained. This is especially important for sites with a high bounce rate (when users visit only one page). The more visitors you have from different regions, the more accurate the network estimate will be. Network estimate unavailable If a network estimate is not available for your application and for the region where the hit originated, the page load timing process reverts to a network estimate across all reporting apps for the region. Failing that, the data is tossed. Note: For browsers that have the Navigation Timing API, this is not an issue, as the navigation start time can be determined without using a cookie.

      "body": "This document explains: How a web page loads How browser monitoring measures page load timing, also known as real user monitoring (RUM) Tip This is a description of traditional, synchronous page load timing. Browser can also monitor asynchronous page load timing. Page load process Here are the major steps in the loading of most web pages. The numbers 1-6 in the diagram correspond to the numbered steps below. Page load timeline: The steps involved in a web page load. Browser monitoring charts display the following segments of that process: Network, Web application, DOM processing, and Page rendering. A page load begins when a user selects a hyperlink, submits a form, or types a URL in a browser. This is also referred to as the initial request or the navigation start. The user's action sends a request across the network to the web application server. The request reaches the application for processing. (The request may take some time to start being processed. This could be the result of request queuing or it could be other factors.) The app finishes processing and sends an HTML response back across the network to the user's browser. This is sometimes referred to as response start or first byte. The user's browser receives the HTML response and starts to process the Document Object Model, or DOM. The DOM finishes loading; this point is known as DOM ready. Using the DOM, the user's browser starts to render the page. The page finishes rendering in the user's browser and the window load event fires. (For pages that use asynchronous loading, some elements may continue to load after the window load event occurs.) Page load time charts in browser monitoring Browser monitoring captures the major page load timing segments in the browser Summary page and the Page views page. If you have SPA monitoring enabled, you will have access to both this chart and SPA-specific charts. The charts show: Network Web application time DOM processing Page rendering Other segments as applicable, such as request queuing The chart colors match the colors in the page load timing diagram. one.newrelic.com > Browser > (select an app) > Summary: The load time chart appears on the Summary and Page views page. The way browser collects these times depends on the browser's capability to use the Navigation Timing Specification API. You can add custom page load timing events with the browser agent API. Here are descriptions of the activity included in the browser load time chart segments: Web application The web application time includes the time spent on the application server. This can only be determined if the browser instrumentation for page load timing was provided by an APM agent. Network The Network layer includes time spent in redirects as well as in requesting and receiving HTML. It does not include time on the server or for static assets. Network time measurement starts from the initial click on a link. Network time includes DNS and may include more than one lookup if you have redirects on your site, TCP (including the firewall, unless you have configured request queue time monitoring), and SSL connect time. If you have configured request queue time monitoring, then the network time does not include any of the request queue time that occurs after the X-Request header. If you have not configured request queue time monitoring, then the network time does include all of the request queue time. The Navigation Timing Specification API provides a detailed breakdown of network time. (For old browsers, the timer starts on the \"before unload event.\") For apps that have been deployed using the copy/paste method, Browser includes web app and queue time in Network time. This is because browser relies on the server-side agent to pass the application values to the browser agent through auto-injection. For more information about how this back-end time breaks down from the browser's point of view, use the Session traces page. The session traces report on all the network related events available, so you can see on a case-by-case basis how the browser is spending time on DNS lookups and other network events. Important Even with request queuing configured, the front-end server's setup can still affect network time. This is because the front-end server does not add the queueing time header until after it actually accepts and processes the request. If the front-end server is configured in some way that causes requests to start backlogging and to queue up in the listener socket that the front-end server uses to accept connections, then you will see network time increase for browser monitoring. The queueing time headers can never account for backlog in this listener socket. DOM processing DOM processing is the time it takes to parse the HTML into a DOM and retrieve or execute synchronous scripts. If the browser starts to download images in this phase, page load timing will capture the image load time. The DOM processing and page rendering layers include network time for static assets (assets that are not explicitly retrieved after page load). However, if a script on the page dynamically inserts image tags and loads images after the server or content delivery system (CDN) finishes, page load timing cannot capture the image load time. Page rendering The Page rendering phase is the time between the DOM being complete and the window load event. This phase measures browser-side processing of the page content, and often includes time for scripts and static assets to load. Request queuing Request queuing will be displayed in the load time chart if your account has both browser and APM linked. In New Relic, request queuing refers to the time between a request entering your production systems and it reaching your application. Depending on the specifics of your production infrastructure, this time may include an actual queue that requests enter, or it may represent other functions that take time (such as load balancing or internal network latency). App server requests vs. browser transactions Often the number of app server transactions (requests per minute or rpm) is larger than the number of browser transactions (pages per minute or ppm) for the same application. For more information, see the troubleshooting procedures. Outliers No matter how well your application performs, there will be some slow browsers, platforms, and networks that make your overall aggregate response times appear slower. To minimize the skew caused by outliers, page load timing clamps and scales the end user response times that are greater than 4.5 times your application's browser Apdex T setting to 4.5 times the Apdex T, or to 13.5 seconds, whichever is greater. (Histogram outliers are cut off at 95%.) For example, if your application's end user Apdex T threshold is 8 seconds, those response times will be clamped at 36 seconds. This minimizes the impact of these response times on your overall application but still provides accounting for \"frustrated\" Apdex scores. For SPA monitoring, outliers are handled differently. When the duration of an initial page load or route change reaches 30 minutes, that event is treated as invalid data and is discarded.",

      "body": "Browser monitoring's PageViewTiming event sends each data point as a separate event as soon as it is available. Because we do not restrict the timing, you can receive first paint or first interaction data regardless of when it fires. This document describes why and how to use PageViewTiming and its attributes to query data about your site, component loading, and user performance metrics, both from visual and responsiveness standpoints. Why use PageViewTiming? If your application uses asynchronous or dynamic pages, you may need additional details about site or component loading. But pages can load content in many different ways, and users control when they interact with that content. This is why some user-centric performance metrics happen outside the standard window onload (page load time) in the browser agent. For example, users may become impatient and begin clicking as soon as content is on the webpage. Or, they may wait to use the page until long after content is loaded. The PageViewTiming event provides a more real-time delivery mechanism that does not have a dependency on any other event. The additional metrics can help you understand how users experience your site, both from visual and responsiveness standpoints. Support for Google's Core Web Vitals We now, with the release of agent version 1177, have full support for Google's Core Web Vitals for 2020. The metrics that make up Core Web Vitals will evolve over time. The current set for 2020 focuses on three aspects of the user experience—loading, interactivity, and visual stability—and includes the following metrics (and their respective thresholds): Core Web Vitals metrics include loading, interactivity, and visual stability. Largest Contentful Paint (LCP): measures loading performance. To provide a good user experience, LCP should occur within 2.5 seconds of when the page first starts loading. First Input Delay (FID): measures interactivity. To provide a good user experience, pages should have a FID of less than 100 milliseconds. Cumulative Layout Shift (CLS): measures visual stability. To provide a good user experience, pages should maintain a CLS of less than 0.1. For each of the above metrics, to ensure you're hitting the recommended target for most of your users, a good threshold to measure is the 75th percentile of page loads, segmented across mobile and desktop devices. To learn more, watch our Nerd Days talk on perceived performance. Detailed visual, interactivity, and responsiveness metrics The BrowserInteraction and PageView events end their reporting when they receive the page window load (or window load and AJAX) timing. However, paint and interactivity metrics can happen at any time. PageViewTiming delivers these metrics as a separate event to: Account for the variability in this timing. Avoid setting an arbitrary timeout. Prevent holding BrowserInteraction and PageView events indefinitely. Additional data Comments firstPaint and firstContentfulPaint The firstPaint and firstContentfulPaint attributes already are available with BrowserInteraction and PageView events. However, they are not always reliably captured before the window onload event fires. Using PageViewTiming gives you a way to capture these metrics even if they happen after the original page load time. This gives you a better understanding of the correlation between responsiveness of that load event and the visual rendering of your content. largestContentfulPaint This new metric, available with agent version 1163, largestContentfulPaint, reports the render time of the largest content element visible in the viewport. Google's research found looking at when the largest element was rendered was a more accurate way to measure when the main content of a page is loaded and useful. Details on this metric, including limitations and considerations can be found in the w3c draft. In addition, we now report the cumulative layout shift (CLS) score attribute with LCP. This attribute is reported as cumulativeLayoutShift. Largest Contentful Paint is one of three metrics identified by Google as the Core Web Vitals. LCP values up to 2.5 secs are considered \"Good\", between 2.5-4.0 secs considered \"Needs Improvement\", and above 4.0 secs considered \"Poor.\" firstInteraction and firstInputDelay With the addition of firstInteraction and firstInputDelay, you can quickly determine the ways that your users are interacting with that visual content. These metrics tell you not only when they interacted, but what type of interaction (mousedown, pointerdown, etc.) and how long it took for them to receive a response from your site. The firstInputDelay metric lies in the middle of FirstContentfulPaint and Time to Interactive (TTI) metrics, measuring the time between when a first input can be made and when the browser's main thread is able to respond to any interactions. In addition, we now report the cumulative layout shift (CLS) score attribute at the moment of the user's first interaction. This attribute is reported as cumulativeLayoutShift. First Input Delay is one of three metrics identified by Google as the Core Web Vitals. FID values up to 100 ms are considered \"Good\", between 100-300 ms considered \"Needs Improvement\", and above 300 ms considered \"Poor.\" For a more detailed explanation, see the Browser release notes. cumulativeLayoutShift Cumulative Layout Shift (CLS), available with agent v1177, is an important, user-centric metric for measuring visual stability because it helps quantify how often users experience unexpected layout shifts—a low CLS helps ensure that the page is delightful. This is one of three metrics identified by Google as the Core Web Vitals. Cumulative Layout Shift is one of three metrics identified by Google as the Core Web Vitals. CLS scores up to 0.1 are considered \"Good\", between 0.1-0.25 considered \"Needs Improvement\", and above 0.25 considered \"Poor.\" timingName You can review different types of activities with the timingName attribute, such as firstPaint, firstContentfulPaint, firstInteraction, largestContentfulPaint, pageHide and windowUnload. For example, a PageViewTiming event may have a timingName of firstPaint and a firstPaint value of .03. The event will also include all default attributes included with the standard BrowserInteraction and PageView events. elementId This is the Id, if specified, of the largestContentfulPaint element. This value will only be reported with the LCP metric. This value can be null. elementSize This is the reported size of the largestContentfulPaint element. This value will only be reported with the LCP metric. pageHide The pageHide event, available with agent v1177, is sent when the browser hides the current page in the process of presenting a different page from the session's history. For example, when the user clicks the browser's Back button, the current page receives a pageHide event before the previous page is shown. Supporting documentation and browser compatibility for the pageHide event can be found in MDN docs. In addition, we now report the cumulative layout shift (CLS) score attribute with pageHide. This attribute is reported as cumulativeLayoutShift. windowLoad The windowLoad event, available with agent v1177, is fired when the whole page has loaded, including all dependent resources such as stylesheets and images. Supporting documentation and browser compatibility for the Window Load event can be found in MDN docs. In addition, we now report the cumulative layout shift (CLS) score attribute with windowLoad. This attribute is reported as cumulativeLayoutShift. windowUnload The windowUnload event, available with agent v1163, is fired when a document or child resource is being unloaded. Supporting documentation and browser compatibility for the Window Unload event can be found in MDN docs. In addition, we now report the cumulative layout shift (CLS) score attribute with windowUnload. This attribute is reported as cumulativeLayoutShift. Compatibility and requirements Requirements: Meets install requirements Reporting of this event requires browser agent version 1153 or higher and a Pro or Pro+SPA agent. Follow our Browser agent release notes to find out when new metrics are released. These metrics are supported by the following browser versions. For unsupported browsers, no PageViewTiming events will be recorded. Metrics Supported browser versions cumulativeLayoutShift Chrome 79 Metric is elevated to stable; changes in metric definition will be reported in this log.

In this case the browser agent has all the data (queue time, app time, DOM content and rendering time) except network time. Navigation start time is required to compute network time. Rather than toss the data, the page load timing feature estimates the network time based on recently accumulated averages for your application, regionally. This way the page load timing feature provides a more accurate throughput measurement, and the rest of the data is retained. This is especially important for sites with a high bounce rate (when users visit only one page). The more visitors you have from different regions, the more accurate the network estimate will be. Network estimate unavailable If a network estimate is not available for your application and for the region where the hit originated, the page load timing process reverts to a network estimate across all reporting apps for the region. Failing that, the data is tossed. Note: For browsers that have the Navigation Timing API, this is not an issue, as the navigation start time can be determined without using a cookie.

Browser can also monitor asynchronous page load timing. Page load process Here are the major steps in the loading of most web pages. The numbers 1-6 in the diagram correspond to the numbered steps below. Page load timeline: The steps involved in a web page load. Browser monitoring charts display the following segments of that process: Network, Web application, DOM processing, and Page rendering. A page load begins when a user selects a hyperlink, submits a form, or types a URL in a browser. This is also referred to as the initial request or the navigation start. The user's action sends a request across the network to the web application server. The request reaches the application for processing. (The request may take some time to start being processed. This could be the result of request queuing or it could be other factors.) The app finishes processing and sends an HTML response back across the network to the user's browser. This is sometimes referred to as response start or first byte. The user's browser receives the HTML response and starts to process the Document Object Model, or DOM. The DOM finishes loading; this point is known as DOM ready. Using the DOM, the user's browser starts to render the page. The page finishes rendering in the user's browser and the window load event fires. (For pages that use asynchronous loading, some elements may continue to load after the window load event occurs.) Page load time charts in browser monitoring Browser monitoring captures the major page load timing segments in the browser Summary page and the Page views page. If you have SPA monitoring enabled, you will have access to both this chart and SPA-specific charts. The charts show: Network Web application time DOM processing Page rendering Other segments as applicable, such as request queuing The chart colors match the colors in the page load timing diagram. one.newrelic.com > Browser > (select an app) > Summary: The load time chart appears on the Summary and Page views page. The way browser collects these times depends on the browser's capability to use the Navigation Timing Specification API. You can add custom page load timing events with the browser agent API. Here are descriptions of the activity included in the browser load time chart segments: Web application The web application time includes the time spent on the application server. This can only be determined if the browser instrumentation for page load timing was provided by an APM agent. Network The Network layer includes time spent in redirects as well as in requesting and receiving HTML. It does not include time on the server or for static assets. Network time measurement starts from the initial click on a link. Network time includes DNS and may include more than one lookup if you have redirects on your site, TCP (including the firewall, unless you have configured request queue time monitoring), and SSL connect time. If you have configured request queue time monitoring, then the network time does not include any of the request queue time that occurs after the X-Request header. If you have not configured request queue time monitoring, then the network time does include all of the request queue time. The Navigation Timing Specification API provides a detailed breakdown of network time. (For old browsers, the timer starts on the \"before unload event.\") For apps that have been deployed using the copy/paste method, Browser includes web app and queue time in Network time. This is because browser relies on the server-side agent to pass the application values to the browser agent through auto-injection. For more information about how this back-end time breaks down from the browser's point of view, use the Session traces page. The session traces report on all the network related events available, so you can see on a case-by-case basis how the browser is spending time on DNS lookups and other network events. Important Even with request queuing configured, the front-end server's setup can still affect network time. This is because the front-end server does not add the queueing time header until after it actually accepts and processes the request. If the front-end server is configured in some way that causes requests to start backlogging and to queue up in the listener socket that the front-end server uses to accept connections, then you will see network time increase for browser monitoring. The queueing time headers can never account for backlog in this listener socket. DOM processing DOM processing is the time it takes to parse the HTML into a DOM and retrieve or execute synchronous scripts. If the browser starts to download images in this phase, page load timing will capture the image load time. The DOM processing and page rendering layers include network time for static assets (assets that are not explicitly retrieved after page load). However, if a script on the page dynamically inserts image tags and loads images after the server or content delivery system (CDN) finishes, page load timing cannot capture the image load time. Page rendering The Page rendering phase is the time between the DOM being complete and the window load event. This phase measures browser-side processing of the page content, and often includes time for scripts and static assets to load. Request queuing Request queuing will be displayed in the load time chart if your account has both browser and APM linked. In New Relic, request queuing refers to the time between a request entering your production systems and it reaching your application. Depending on the specifics of your production infrastructure, this time may include an actual queue that requests enter, or it may represent other functions that take time (such as load balancing or internal network latency). App server requests vs. browser transactions Often the number of app server transactions (requests per minute or rpm) is larger than the number of browser transactions (pages per minute or ppm) for the same application. For more information, see the troubleshooting procedures. Outliers No matter how well your application performs, there will be some slow browsers, platforms, and networks that make your overall aggregate response times appear slower. To minimize the skew caused by outliers, page load timing clamps and scales the end user response times that are greater than 4.5 times your application's browser Apdex T setting to 4.5 times the Apdex T, or to 13.5 seconds, whichever is greater. (Histogram outliers are cut off at 95%.) For example, if your application's end user Apdex T threshold is 8 seconds, those response times will be clamped at 36 seconds. This minimizes the impact of these response times on your overall application but still provides accounting for \"frustrated\" Apdex scores. For SPA monitoring, outliers are handled differently. When the duration of an initial page load or route change reaches 30 minutes, that event is treated as invalid data and is discarded.",

      "body": "Browser monitoring's PageViewTiming event sends each data point as a separate event as soon as it is available. Because we do not restrict the timing, you can receive first paint or first interaction data regardless of when it fires. This document describes why and how to use PageViewTiming and its attributes to query data about your site, component loading, and user performance metrics, both from visual and responsiveness standpoints. Why use PageViewTiming? If your application uses asynchronous or dynamic pages, you may need additional details about site or component loading. But pages can load content in many different ways, and users control when they interact with that content. This is why some user-centric performance metrics happen outside the standard window onload (page load time) in the browser agent. For example, users may become impatient and begin clicking as soon as content is on the webpage. Or, they may wait to use the page until long after content is loaded. The PageViewTiming event provides a more real-time delivery mechanism that does not have a dependency on any other event. The additional metrics can help you understand how users experience your site, both from visual and responsiveness standpoints. Support for Google's Core Web Vitals We now, with the release of agent version 1177, have full support for Google's Core Web Vitals for 2020. The metrics that make up Core Web Vitals will evolve over time. The current set for 2020 focuses on three aspects of the user experience—loading, interactivity, and visual stability—and includes the following metrics (and their respective thresholds): Core Web Vitals metrics include loading, interactivity, and visual stability. Largest Contentful Paint (LCP): measures loading performance. To provide a good user experience, LCP should occur within 2.5 seconds of when the page first starts loading. First Input Delay (FID): measures interactivity. To provide a good user experience, pages should have a FID of less than 100 milliseconds. Cumulative Layout Shift (CLS): measures visual stability. To provide a good user experience, pages should maintain a CLS of less than 0.1. For each of the above metrics, to ensure you're hitting the recommended target for most of your users, a good threshold to measure is the 75th percentile of page loads, segmented across mobile and desktop devices. To learn more, watch our Nerd Days talk on perceived performance. Detailed visual, interactivity, and responsiveness metrics The BrowserInteraction and PageView events end their reporting when they receive the page window load (or window load and AJAX) timing. However, paint and interactivity metrics can happen at any time. PageViewTiming delivers these metrics as a separate event to: Account for the variability in this timing. Avoid setting an arbitrary timeout. Prevent holding BrowserInteraction and PageView events indefinitely. Additional data Comments firstPaint and firstContentfulPaint The firstPaint and firstContentfulPaint attributes already are available with BrowserInteraction and PageView events. However, they are not always reliably captured before the window onload event fires. Using PageViewTiming gives you a way to capture these metrics even if they happen after the original page load time. This gives you a better understanding of the correlation between responsiveness of that load event and the visual rendering of your content. largestContentfulPaint This new metric, available with agent version 1163, largestContentfulPaint, reports the render time of the largest content element visible in the viewport. Google's research found looking at when the largest element was rendered was a more accurate way to measure when the main content of a page is loaded and useful. Details on this metric, including limitations and considerations can be found in the w3c draft. In addition, we now report the cumulative layout shift (CLS) score attribute with LCP. This attribute is reported as cumulativeLayoutShift. Largest Contentful Paint is one of three metrics identified by Google as the Core Web Vitals. LCP values up to 2.5 secs are considered \"Good\", between 2.5-4.0 secs considered \"Needs Improvement\", and above 4.0 secs considered \"Poor.\" firstInteraction and firstInputDelay With the addition of firstInteraction and firstInputDelay, you can quickly determine the ways that your users are interacting with that visual content. These metrics tell you not only when they interacted, but what type of interaction (mousedown, pointerdown, etc.) and how long it took for them to receive a response from your site. The firstInputDelay metric lies in the middle of FirstContentfulPaint and Time to Interactive (TTI) metrics, measuring the time between when a first input can be made and when the browser's main thread is able to respond to any interactions. In addition, we now report the cumulative layout shift (CLS) score attribute at the moment of the user's first interaction. This attribute is reported as cumulativeLayoutShift. First Input Delay is one of three metrics identified by Google as the Core Web Vitals. FID values up to 100 ms are considered \"Good\", between 100-300 ms considered \"Needs Improvement\", and above 300 ms considered \"Poor.\" For a more detailed explanation, see the Browser release notes. cumulativeLayoutShift Cumulative Layout Shift (CLS), available with agent v1177, is an important, user-centric metric for measuring visual stability because it helps quantify how often users experience unexpected layout shifts—a low CLS helps ensure that the page is delightful. This is one of three metrics identified by Google as the Core Web Vitals. Cumulative Layout Shift is one of three metrics identified by Google as the Core Web Vitals. CLS scores up to 0.1 are considered \"Good\", between 0.1-0.25 considered \"Needs Improvement\", and above 0.25 considered \"Poor.\" timingName You can review different types of activities with the timingName attribute, such as firstPaint, firstContentfulPaint, firstInteraction, largestContentfulPaint, pageHide and windowUnload. For example, a PageViewTiming event may have a timingName of firstPaint and a firstPaint value of .03. The event will also include all default attributes included with the standard BrowserInteraction and PageView events. elementId This is the Id, if specified, of the largestContentfulPaint element. This value will only be reported with the LCP metric. This value can be null. elementSize This is the reported size of the largestContentfulPaint element. This value will only be reported with the LCP metric. pageHide The pageHide event, available with agent v1177, is sent when the browser hides the current page in the process of presenting a different page from the session's history. For example, when the user clicks the browser's Back button, the current page receives a pageHide event before the previous page is shown. Supporting documentation and browser compatibility for the pageHide event can be found in MDN docs. In addition, we now report the cumulative layout shift (CLS) score attribute with pageHide. This attribute is reported as cumulativeLayoutShift. windowLoad The windowLoad event, available with agent v1177, is fired when the whole page has loaded, including all dependent resources such as stylesheets and images. Supporting documentation and browser compatibility for the Window Load event can be found in MDN docs. In addition, we now report the cumulative layout shift (CLS) score attribute with windowLoad. This attribute is reported as cumulativeLayoutShift. windowUnload The windowUnload event, available with agent v1163, is fired when a document or child resource is being unloaded. Supporting documentation and browser compatibility for the Window Unload event can be found in MDN docs. In addition, we now report the cumulative layout shift (CLS) score attribute with windowUnload. This attribute is reported as cumulativeLayoutShift. Compatibility and requirements Requirements: Meets install requirements Reporting of this event requires browser agent version 1153 or higher and a Pro or Pro+SPA agent. Follow our Browser agent release notes to find out when new metrics are released. These metrics are supported by the following browser versions. For unsupported browsers, no PageViewTiming events will be recorded. Metrics Supported browser versions cumulativeLayoutShift Chrome 79 Metric is elevated to stable; changes in metric definition will be reported in this log. Chrome 77 Metric exposed via API: Cumulative Layout Shift available via Layout Instability API firstPaint firstContentfulPaint Chrome 60 or higher for desktop and mobile (Android webview and Chrome for Android) Opera 47 or higher for desktop Opera 44 or higher for Android mobile Samsung Internet for mobile largestContentfulPaint Chrome 77 or higher for desktop and mobile firstInteraction firstInputDelay These metrics require the addEventListener browser API. This API is available in all modern browsers, including: Apple Safari Google Chrome Microsoft Internet Explorer (IE) versions 9 or higher Mozilla Firefox pageHide This metric is currently supported by all browsers on desktop and mobile.

App server requests vs. browser transactions Often the number of app server transactions (requests per minute or rpm) is larger than the number of browser transactions (pages per minute or ppm) for the same application. For more information, see the troubleshooting procedures. Outliers No matter how well your application performs, there will be some slow browsers, platforms, and networks that make your overall aggregate response times appear slower. To minimize the skew caused by outliers, page load timing clamps and scales the end user response times that are greater than 4.5 times your application's browser Apdex T setting to 4.5 times the Apdex T, or to 13.5 seconds, whichever is greater. (Histogram outliers are cut off at 95%.) For example, if your application's end user Apdex T threshold is 8 seconds, those response times will be clamped at 36 seconds. This minimizes the impact of these response times on your overall application but still provides accounting for \"frustrated\" Apdex scores. For SPA monitoring, outliers are handled differently. When the duration of an initial page load or route change reaches 30 minutes, that event is treated as invalid data and is discarded.",

      "body": "Browser monitoring's PageViewTiming event sends each data point as a separate event as soon as it is available. Because we do not restrict the timing, you can receive first paint or first interaction data regardless of when it fires. This document describes why and how to use PageViewTiming and its attributes to query data about your site, component loading, and user performance metrics, both from visual and responsiveness standpoints. Why use PageViewTiming? If your application uses asynchronous or dynamic pages, you may need additional details about site or component loading. But pages can load content in many different ways, and users control when they interact with that content. This is why some user-centric performance metrics happen outside the standard window onload (page load time) in the browser agent. For example, users may become impatient and begin clicking as soon as content is on the webpage. Or, they may wait to use the page until long after content is loaded. The PageViewTiming event provides a more real-time delivery mechanism that does not have a dependency on any other event. The additional metrics can help you understand how users experience your site, both from visual and responsiveness standpoints. Support for Google's Core Web Vitals We now, with the release of agent version 1177, have full support for Google's Core Web Vitals for 2020. The metrics that make up Core Web Vitals will evolve over time. The current set for 2020 focuses on three aspects of the user experience—loading, interactivity, and visual stability—and includes the following metrics (and their respective thresholds): Core Web Vitals metrics include loading, interactivity, and visual stability. Largest Contentful Paint (LCP): measures loading performance. To provide a good user experience, LCP should occur within 2.5 seconds of when the page first starts loading. First Input Delay (FID): measures interactivity. To provide a good user experience, pages should have a FID of less than 100 milliseconds. Cumulative Layout Shift (CLS): measures visual stability. To provide a good user experience, pages should maintain a CLS of less than 0.1. For each of the above metrics, to ensure you're hitting the recommended target for most of your users, a good threshold to measure is the 75th percentile of page loads, segmented across mobile and desktop devices. To learn more, watch our Nerd Days talk on perceived performance. Detailed visual, interactivity, and responsiveness metrics The BrowserInteraction and PageView events end their reporting when they receive the page window load (or window load and AJAX) timing. However, paint and interactivity metrics can happen at any time. PageViewTiming delivers these metrics as a separate event to: Account for the variability in this timing. Avoid setting an arbitrary timeout. Prevent holding BrowserInteraction and PageView events indefinitely. Additional data Comments firstPaint and firstContentfulPaint The firstPaint and firstContentfulPaint attributes already are available with BrowserInteraction and PageView events. However, they are not always reliably captured before the window onload event fires. Using PageViewTiming gives you a way to capture these metrics even if they happen after the original page load time. This gives you a better understanding of the correlation between responsiveness of that load event and the visual rendering of your content. largestContentfulPaint This new metric, available with agent version 1163, largestContentfulPaint, reports the render time of the largest content element visible in the viewport. Google's research found looking at when the largest element was rendered was a more accurate way to measure when the main content of a page is loaded and useful. Details on this metric, including limitations and considerations can be found in the w3c draft. In addition, we now report the cumulative layout shift (CLS) score attribute with LCP. This attribute is reported as cumulativeLayoutShift. Largest Contentful Paint is one of three metrics identified by Google as the Core Web Vitals. LCP values up to 2.5 secs are considered \"Good\", between 2.5-4.0 secs considered \"Needs Improvement\", and above 4.0 secs considered \"Poor.\" firstInteraction and firstInputDelay With the addition of firstInteraction and firstInputDelay, you can quickly determine the ways that your users are interacting with that visual content. These metrics tell you not only when they interacted, but what type of interaction (mousedown, pointerdown, etc.) and how long it took for them to receive a response from your site. The firstInputDelay metric lies in the middle of FirstContentfulPaint and Time to Interactive (TTI) metrics, measuring the time between when a first input can be made and when the browser's main thread is able to respond to any interactions. In addition, we now report the cumulative layout shift (CLS) score attribute at the moment of the user's first interaction. This attribute is reported as cumulativeLayoutShift. First Input Delay is one of three metrics identified by Google as the Core Web Vitals. FID values up to 100 ms are considered \"Good\", between 100-300 ms considered \"Needs Improvement\", and above 300 ms considered \"Poor.\" For a more detailed explanation, see the Browser release notes. cumulativeLayoutShift Cumulative Layout Shift (CLS), available with agent v1177, is an important, user-centric metric for measuring visual stability because it helps quantify how often users experience unexpected layout shifts—a low CLS helps ensure that the page is delightful. This is one of three metrics identified by Google as the Core Web Vitals. Cumulative Layout Shift is one of three metrics identified by Google as the Core Web Vitals. CLS scores up to 0.1 are considered \"Good\", between 0.1-0.25 considered \"Needs Improvement\", and above 0.25 considered \"Poor.\" timingName You can review different types of activities with the timingName attribute, such as firstPaint, firstContentfulPaint, firstInteraction, largestContentfulPaint, pageHide and windowUnload. For example, a PageViewTiming event may have a timingName of firstPaint and a firstPaint value of .03. The event will also include all default attributes included with the standard BrowserInteraction and PageView events. elementId This is the Id, if specified, of the largestContentfulPaint element. This value will only be reported with the LCP metric. This value can be null. elementSize This is the reported size of the largestContentfulPaint element. This value will only be reported with the LCP metric. pageHide The pageHide event, available with agent v1177, is sent when the browser hides the current page in the process of presenting a different page from the session's history. For example, when the user clicks the browser's Back button, the current page receives a pageHide event before the previous page is shown. Supporting documentation and browser compatibility for the pageHide event can be found in MDN docs. In addition, we now report the cumulative layout shift (CLS) score attribute with pageHide. This attribute is reported as cumulativeLayoutShift. windowLoad The windowLoad event, available with agent v1177, is fired when the whole page has loaded, including all dependent resources such as stylesheets and images. Supporting documentation and browser compatibility for the Window Load event can be found in MDN docs. In addition, we now report the cumulative layout shift (CLS) score attribute with windowLoad. This attribute is reported as cumulativeLayoutShift. windowUnload The windowUnload event, available with agent v1163, is fired when a document or child resource is being unloaded. Supporting documentation and browser compatibility for the Window Unload event can be found in MDN docs. In addition, we now report the cumulative layout shift (CLS) score attribute with windowUnload. This attribute is reported as cumulativeLayoutShift. Compatibility and requirements Requirements: Meets install requirements Reporting of this event requires browser agent version 1153 or higher and a Pro or Pro+SPA agent. Follow our Browser agent release notes to find out when new metrics are released. These metrics are supported by the following browser versions. For unsupported browsers, no PageViewTiming events will be recorded. Metrics Supported browser versions cumulativeLayoutShift Chrome 79 Metric is elevated to stable; changes in metric definition will be reported in this log. Chrome 77 Metric exposed via API: Cumulative Layout Shift available via Layout Instability API firstPaint firstContentfulPaint Chrome 60 or higher for desktop and mobile (Android webview and Chrome for Android) Opera 47 or higher for desktop Opera 44 or higher for Android mobile Samsung Internet for mobile largestContentfulPaint Chrome 77 or higher for desktop and mobile firstInteraction firstInputDelay These metrics require the addEventListener browser API. This API is available in all modern browsers, including: Apple Safari Google Chrome Microsoft Internet Explorer (IE) versions 9 or higher Mozilla Firefox pageHide This metric is currently supported by all browsers on desktop and mobile.

If a user navigates from a site without page load timing to a site with page load timing (for example, to the first page on your page load timing-enabled site), special considerations for navigation start time arise. Contents Network estimate The page load timing JavaScript utility file creates a cookie with the navigation start time when a user leaves a page (by hooking an event, beforeunload, or pagehide, depending on the browser). However, when navigating away from a site without page load timing enabled, the JavaScript code will not be present, and the cookie will not be created. Then, when the user hits the first page of a site, the navigation start time cannot be determined, because there is no cookie. In this case the browser agent has all the data (queue time, app time, DOM content and rendering time) except network time. Navigation start time is required to compute network time. Rather than toss the data, the page load timing feature estimates the network time based on recently accumulated averages for your application, regionally. This way the page load timing feature provides a more accurate throughput measurement, and the rest of the data is retained. This is especially important for sites with a high bounce rate (when users visit only one page). The more visitors you have from different regions, the more accurate the network estimate will be. Network estimate unavailable If a network estimate is not available for your application and for the region where the hit originated, the page load timing process reverts to a network estimate across all reporting apps for the region. Failing that, the data is tossed. Note: For browsers that have the Navigation Timing API, this is not an issue, as the navigation start time can be determined without using a cookie.

      "body": "This document explains: How a web page loads How browser monitoring measures page load timing, also known as real user monitoring (RUM) Tip This is a description of traditional, synchronous page load timing. Browser can also monitor asynchronous page load timing. Page load process Here are the major steps in the loading of most web pages. The numbers 1-6 in the diagram correspond to the numbered steps below. Page load timeline: The steps involved in a web page load. Browser monitoring charts display the following segments of that process: Network, Web application, DOM processing, and Page rendering. A page load begins when a user selects a hyperlink, submits a form, or types a URL in a browser. This is also referred to as the initial request or the navigation start. The user's action sends a request across the network to the web application server. The request reaches the application for processing. (The request may take some time to start being processed. This could be the result of request queuing or it could be other factors.) The app finishes processing and sends an HTML response back across the network to the user's browser. This is sometimes referred to as response start or first byte. The user's browser receives the HTML response and starts to process the Document Object Model, or DOM. The DOM finishes loading; this point is known as DOM ready. Using the DOM, the user's browser starts to render the page. The page finishes rendering in the user's browser and the window load event fires. (For pages that use asynchronous loading, some elements may continue to load after the window load event occurs.) Page load time charts in browser monitoring Browser monitoring captures the major page load timing segments in the browser Summary page and the Page views page. If you have SPA monitoring enabled, you will have access to both this chart and SPA-specific charts. The charts show: Network Web application time DOM processing Page rendering Other segments as applicable, such as request queuing The chart colors match the colors in the page load timing diagram. one.newrelic.com > Browser > (select an app) > Summary: The load time chart appears on the Summary and Page views page. The way browser collects these times depends on the browser's capability to use the Navigation Timing Specification API. You can add custom page load timing events with the browser agent API. Here are descriptions of the activity included in the browser load time chart segments: Web application The web application time includes the time spent on the application server. This can only be determined if the browser instrumentation for page load timing was provided by an APM agent. Network The Network layer includes time spent in redirects as well as in requesting and receiving HTML. It does not include time on the server or for static assets. Network time measurement starts from the initial click on a link. Network time includes DNS and may include more than one lookup if you have redirects on your site, TCP (including the firewall, unless you have configured request queue time monitoring), and SSL connect time. If you have configured request queue time monitoring, then the network time does not include any of the request queue time that occurs after the X-Request header. If you have not configured request queue time monitoring, then the network time does include all of the request queue time. The Navigation Timing Specification API provides a detailed breakdown of network time. (For old browsers, the timer starts on the \"before unload event.\") For apps that have been deployed using the copy/paste method, Browser includes web app and queue time in Network time. This is because browser relies on the server-side agent to pass the application values to the browser agent through auto-injection. For more information about how this back-end time breaks down from the browser's point of view, use the Session traces page. The session traces report on all the network related events available, so you can see on a case-by-case basis how the browser is spending time on DNS lookups and other network events. Important Even with request queuing configured, the front-end server's setup can still affect network time. This is because the front-end server does not add the queueing time header until after it actually accepts and processes the request. If the front-end server is configured in some way that causes requests to start backlogging and to queue up in the listener socket that the front-end server uses to accept connections, then you will see network time increase for browser monitoring. The queueing time headers can never account for backlog in this listener socket. DOM processing DOM processing is the time it takes to parse the HTML into a DOM and retrieve or execute synchronous scripts. If the browser starts to download images in this phase, page load timing will capture the image load time. The DOM processing and page rendering layers include network time for static assets (assets that are not explicitly retrieved after page load). However, if a script on the page dynamically inserts image tags and loads images after the server or content delivery system (CDN) finishes, page load timing cannot capture the image load time. Page rendering The Page rendering phase is the time between the DOM being complete and the window load event. This phase measures browser-side processing of the page content, and often includes time for scripts and static assets to load. Request queuing Request queuing will be displayed in the load time chart if your account has both browser and APM linked. In New Relic, request queuing refers to the time between a request entering your production systems and it reaching your application. Depending on the specifics of your production infrastructure, this time may include an actual queue that requests enter, or it may represent other functions that take time (such as load balancing or internal network latency). App server requests vs. browser transactions Often the number of app server transactions (requests per minute or rpm) is larger than the number of browser transactions (pages per minute or ppm) for the same application. For more information, see the troubleshooting procedures. Outliers No matter how well your application performs, there will be some slow browsers, platforms, and networks that make your overall aggregate response times appear slower. To minimize the skew caused by outliers, page load timing clamps and scales the end user response times that are greater than 4.5 times your application's browser Apdex T setting to 4.5 times the Apdex T, or to 13.5 seconds, whichever is greater. (Histogram outliers are cut off at 95%.) For example, if your application's end user Apdex T threshold is 8 seconds, those response times will be clamped at 36 seconds. This minimizes the impact of these response times on your overall application but still provides accounting for \"frustrated\" Apdex scores. For SPA monitoring, outliers are handled differently. When the duration of an initial page load or route change reaches 30 minutes, that event is treated as invalid data and is discarded.",

      "body": "If a browser does not use the Navigation timing API for page load timing, the browser uses a cookie to determine the navigation start time. If a user navigates from a site without page load timing to a site with page load timing (for example, to the first page on your page load timing-enabled site), special considerations for navigation start time arise. Contents Network estimate The page load timing JavaScript utility file creates a cookie with the navigation start time when a user leaves a page (by hooking an event, beforeunload, or pagehide, depending on the browser). However, when navigating away from a site without page load timing enabled, the JavaScript code will not be present, and the cookie will not be created. Then, when the user hits the first page of a site, the navigation start time cannot be determined, because there is no cookie. In this case the browser agent has all the data (queue time, app time, DOM content and rendering time) except network time. Navigation start time is required to compute network time. Rather than toss the data, the page load timing feature estimates the network time based on recently accumulated averages for your application, regionally. This way the page load timing feature provides a more accurate throughput measurement, and the rest of the data is retained. This is especially important for sites with a high bounce rate (when users visit only one page). The more visitors you have from different regions, the more accurate the network estimate will be. Network estimate unavailable If a network estimate is not available for your application and for the region where the hit originated, the page load timing process reverts to a network estimate across all reporting apps for the region. Failing that, the data is tossed. Note: For browsers that have the Navigation Timing API, this is not an issue, as the navigation start time can be determined without using a cookie.

      "body": "For standard page load timing, sometimes referred to as real user monitoring (RUM), we measure the overall time to load the entire webpage. Additional monitoring after page load provides details on in-page AJAX calls, JavaScript errors, and other events and interactions. Browser monitoring can leverage the New Relic agent to dynamically inject JavaScript into pages as they are built, in order to collect more detailed back-end timing information. Browser can also monitor apps with single-page application (SPA) architectures. Instrumentation to collect browser data To collect data, browser monitoring uses JavaScript elements pasted or injected into your webpages, typically as part of the HEAD of the page, containing configuration details and essential browser environment instrumentation. Once the page finishes loading, an additional script is downloaded from a CDN server. This additional script processes the collected data and reports it back to New Relic via bam.nr-data.net so that you can see the data in your New Relic account. The script elements can be injected automatically or via the agent API by an APM agent installed in the back-end application, or they can be inserted manually via copy/paste. Both API calls and the copy/paste method allow you to control when and where the script elements are inserted. We use these methods to collect the page load timing information: Method Collecting page load timing information Browsers with Navigation Timing Specification API For browsers that implement the Navigation Timing Specification API, page load timing information is read from the browser and reported to New Relic by the browser agent. The appropriate values simply are read from the webpage's performance timing object to capture the timing information. Navigation start: navigationStart First byte: responseStart DOM ready: DOMContentLoadedEventEnd Page ready: loadEventEnd Browsers without Navigation Timing Specification API For browsers that do not implement the Navigation Timing Specification API, we rely on the NREUM cookie and the browser agent to collect timing information. Additional instrumentation Browser also uses: Instrumentation of the XMLHttpRequest object to collect AJAX timing data. Instrumentation of JavaScript functions to collect uncaught JavaScript errors. Resource Timing API For browsers that implement the Resource Timing API, the browser agent reads and reports session trace details. Single page app (SPA) monitoring For SPA monitoring, we require the Navigation Timing Specification API and the addEventListener API. JavaScript placement requirements Injecting the JavaScript inline in the HEAD is an unusual requirement for a JavaScript library, and different from how third-party scripts are typically included. We require this so that browser provides accurate information without impacting page load performance. The injected browser JavaScript elements wrap many of the browser's built in APIs to record information about JavaScript errors or callback timings. The unusual placement of the code element is necessary for the following reasons: The inline HEAD placement ensures the instrumentation code is loaded before all other scripts so that wrapping will occur when other libraries are registered. Inline code placement also eliminates the network round trips caused by externally referenced scripts. Data transmission For both https and http webpages, we transmit data via https. This summarizes when the data is transmitted to and from the webpage. Important New Relic requires support of the SHA256 hash function, which some older operating systems do not support. If an end user lacks SHA256, the browser agent will not connect to New Relic and data will not be sent. Data transmission Frequency Fetch the agent script Once following page load via https Send page load timing data Once following page load via https Send AJAX and JavaScript error data Once per minute when there is activity via https Send session trace data Every ten seconds when there is activity and a session trace is occurring via https Send SPA data At the end of an interaction via https",
