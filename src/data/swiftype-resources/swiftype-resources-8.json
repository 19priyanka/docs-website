      "body": "The APM Summary page provides general information about the selected app, including web transactions and non-web transactions, Apdex score, CPU usage, throughput (requests per minute or rpm), transaction times, error rate, application activity, and hosts. Tip To get a high-level overview of all your applications and services, use the New Relic explorer. View your app's summary page To reach the Summary page, go to one.newrelic.com > Explorer > Services - APM > (select an app). Use the Explorer to access all your entities, that is, anything we can identify that reports data, from applications and hosts to custom groupings of any elements. Alternatively, you can go to one.newrelic.com > APM > (select an app). For more information, see the documentation about navigating core UI components in New Relic One. View app performance Use the Summary page for a quick summary of your website's performance. Overview charts Some charts include links to APM pages where you can drill down into additional details. APM Summary chart Comments Transactions response time This stacked chart represents the response time of web transactions or non-web transactions in your app. Segments in the chart vary depending on which agent you are using. Some charts may have an independent line for response time that represents the relationship between response time and total time. Also, for your external or background services, you may see data labeled as Web external. For more information about these out-of-process services, use the Externals page. Apdex score This chart measures the performance of your app based on its Apdex T value during the selected time window. To view additional details, hover over the question icon or the chart's End user and App server lines. The End user line charts the Apdex for your browser apps, and the App server line charts the Apdex for your APM apps. Throughput This chart illustrates the requests per minute for either web transactions or non-web transactions. To change the type of transaction, select the Transaction response time chart's dropdown arrow, then select Web or Non-web. Error rate This chart shows the number of errors that have occurred in the current time window. The tooltip that appears when you hover over the Error rate chart shows the combined throughput for both web and non-web transactions. To understand how error rate is calculated, see Application error rate example. Event markers Markers on the main Summary chart indicate events and changes to the app: Black vertical bar: Apdex settings have changed. Blue vertical bar: A deployment marker has been created or another event has occurred, such as a settings change for the app. Yellow or red area: This indicates alert thresholds have been violated. To view additional information, mouse over the marker. Drill-down details Use any of New Relic's standard page functions to drill down into detailed information. Here is a summary of additional options with the APM Summary page. If you want to... Do this... Change how data appears on the main chart Select the chart title's drop-down arrow, and then select your choice of view options, including histograms or percentiles if available. View threshold levels for your app's Apdex score Mouse over the Apdex score ? icon. For non-web transactions, the Apdex chart is blank because Apdex is not applicable to this class of apps. View trends in transaction time, Apdex, and throughput Select the Compare with yesterday and last week checkbox. The checkbox is only available when viewing the Web transaction response time chart with the time picker window Ending now. The checkbox is unavailable if you are viewing histograms, percentiles, or custom dates. View app performance since the last deployment From the time picker, select Performance since the last deployment. For detailed information about all deployments, select the Deployments page. View the Transactions page Select the Transactions table's heading on the APM Summary page. Or, to view details about a specific transaction (including operations, transaction traces, and key transactions), select its name. View the Databases or External services pages Click on a related time band in the Web transactions response time chart. View the Errors page Select the Error rate chart's title on the APM Summary page. You can also view the Errors page from one.newrelic.com > (select an app) > Events > Errors. Browser monitoring data If you install the browser agent via an APM agent, you can automatically link the browser-monitored app to the APM-monitored app. Once the browser agent is set up, the APM Summary page provides summary information and direct links to detailed information on the app's corresponding browser summary page. To view chart details with browser page load time, select the main chart's Browser link. To view the Apdex score for browsers, select the Apdex chart's Browser link. Link app performance to resources The APM Summary page shows a table with averages about your app's instances on their hosts, including: Apdex Response time Throughput Error rate CPU usage Memory Tip CPU usage percentage is calculated as though the application is running on one CPU core. For more information about this calculation, see CPU usage is over 100%. Examine app performance within system context Use any of these options to examine your app's performance within the context of your system's architecture and resources, such as individual hosts: Select your choice from the table at the bottom of the APM Summary page for infrastructure. Toggle between a table view or breakout metric details. If applicable, select your choice from the drop-down at the top of the APM Summary page for servers or JVMs. Examine details within infrastructure To help you understand the full context of your app's performance within your environment, APM includes options to view performance from inside the application, as well as from outside the application with the infrastructure agent. To view detailed information from your resources' point of view, click any host link. The link takes you directly to the infrastructure Compute page. When you click, the Compute data may not immediately appear. If that happens, follow the prompt to validate your account and complete the conversion process for the infrastructure agent. If you need additional help, get support at support.newrelic.com. Troubleshoot host link To troubleshoot the host link from the APM Summary page, use these tips: Host link from APM Summary Troubleshooting tips Your infrastructure agent is not installed on the host. Follow standard procedures to install our infrastructure agent. The application is operating within a container, and your infrastructure agent is installed on the container’s host. Set the hostname for the container to be the hostname of the underlying server. Docker containers: Run your Docker container with the argument: --uts=\"host\" Copy This will cause the container to share the UTS Linux Namespace with the underlying host. However, by using this set, a privileged container could change the host's hostname. The application is running on a Windows container, and your infrastructure agent is installed on the Windows host. To get a direct link to infrastructure metric data for your application, enable process metrics in the infrastructure agent's configuration. Your infrastructure agent is installed, but it only reports the short hostname, not the long hostname. Configure your server's hostname settings so that the infrastructure agent and the APM agent return the exact same name string. If possible, do so by editing your server's fully qualified domain name (FQDN) settings. The APM and infrastructure agents both read their hostname from the operating system's FQDN settings, so setting the hostname there ensures both agents share a single hostname. For more information, see the Java agent troubleshooting example.",

      "body": "APM's Transactions page helps you identify transactions that may be good candidates for fine-tuning performance problems or resolving errors. This page lists the selected app's transaction Requests, the top five transactions by percent of wall-clock time, and relevant throughputs (requests per minute or rpm). For non-web transactions (such as message processing, background tasks, and other processes and jobs that do not handle web requests), this page shows charts of CPU and memory usage. Types of transactions Tip To get a high-level overview of all your applications and services, use the New Relic Explorer. Depending on your selected application, the Transactions page may include a dropdown you can use to select from the types of transactions available. New Relic measures processing time by type of request (web transaction or non-web transaction). This may include: Web: App server requests Non-web: Other requests (operations, background tasks, etc.) The Transactions page also may include links to transaction traces and key transactions. The types of information available will depend on your selected app and the type of request (web or non-web). Wall-clock time Wall-clock time is the amount of time recorded by the clock. New Relic uses wall-clock time for all the transactions and then sums that value across all of the transactions. The host can execute requests in parallel, so you may see percentages over 100. For example, 100% would indicate that the execution time across all selected transactions is equal to the time expended when recording wall-clock time. View transactions To view information about your app's transaction requests: Do one of the following: Go to one.newrelic.com > APM > (select an app) > Monitor > Transactions. Go to one.newrelic.com > Explorer > (select an app) > Monitor > Transactions. If applicable: To change which available types of transactions appear, select the Type. Select the sort order, or keep the default. Select the type of view as a chart (default), histogram, or percentile, if available. To view additional details, use any of the transaction drill-down functions. To add a chart to a dashboard, mouse over the chart, then select the Add to a dashboard link that appears below it. If a chart's background is light red, this indicates a time period when an alert condition's Critical threshold has been violated. To view the incident details in New Relic Alerts, click the chart. For more information, see the documentation about navigating core UI components in New Relic One. Use drill-down functions Use any of New Relic's standard user interface functions to drill down into detailed information. The Transactions page has additional drill-down functions. Change the displayed transaction Type If the Type dropdown appears above list of transactions, you can select your choice of transaction type. The available types depend on what transactions your application uses. Select the type of performance measurement (Sort) The Sort dropdown above the transaction list allows you to review transactions according to different measurements. This helps you identify good candidates for performance tuning or fixing errors. You can sort by: Sort option Comments Most time consuming (default) Highest percentage of the app's total time used. This measures which transactions consumed the most time in total. This is calculated by multiplying the number of times the transaction is called by the time the transaction took to complete. A transaction could be short, but if it is frequently called, it would appear at the top of this ranking. Slowest average response time Slowest individual transactions for the time period as averaged. This measures the slowest types of transaction. A transaction could be called only a few times, but if it is one of the longest transactions to finish, it would appear at the top of this ranking. Apdex most dissatisfying Transactions with the highest percentages of user dissatisfaction levels for the response time of your web apps and services (Apdex). The dissatisfaction level is the difference between a perfect Apdex score (1.0) and your app's apdex_t (\"tolerating\") score, based on your Apdex settings. Transactions that have the highest (worst) percentages appear at the top of this ranking. Highest throughput This measures the amount of throughput, in operation requests per minute or rpm. (For web throughput, requests per minute is sometimes called pages per minute or ppm.) Transactions that have the highest number of requests per minute appear at the top of this ranking. Tip Depending on the transaction type you choose, different sort options may be available. Mouse over summary information about a transaction To quickly view key pieces of information about the transaction, mouse over its name on the list. Select detailed information about a transaction To view detailed information, select a transaction from the list, then select App performance or Historical performance. You can also view transaction traces. View transaction data in different visual formats The Transaction page's Top 5 transactions chart and a selected transaction's App performance window include options to view data as a: Chart Histogram Percentile In addition, from the Breakdown table for a selected transaction, you can select the link to show or hide all segments of the breakdown data. Show corresponding browser request data In order to view browser information, you must install the browser agent. Then, to view corresponding browser request data, use either of these options: Select the Browser drill-down link if available. Go to one.newrelic.com > Browser > (select an app) > Page views. Identify transaction segments with high call counts or time In a transaction's Breakdown table, the Avg calls (per txn) column may include colorized segment values. These indicate instrumented segments that have exceeded thresholds. Yellow: Segment time is more than 10% of total transaction time and call count is higher than 10. Red: Segment time is more than 10% of total transaction time and call count is higher than 20. Show all transactions To view all available transactions as a table, select the Show all transactions table link. From here, use any of the available options: To change the sort order, select any column header. To export the data to a file with comma-separated values, select Export as CSV. To return to the previous chart view, select Back to top transactions. CSV tables for ending now time periods are calculated at run time. They may show slightly higher values than what appears in the APM table. For each transaction, the Show all transactions table includes these measurements: Measurement Definition Apdex The average Apdex score for all transactions that occurred in the selected time range. Apdex scores marked with an * asterisk indicate the agent collected fewer than 100 samples for that transaction name. Data for these transactions may be less accurate than data for transactions with higher throughput. Count The total number of all transactions that occurred in the selected time range. Avg (ms) The average time taken by all transactions in the selected time range. SD (ms) The standard deviation of all timing measurements for all transactions in the selected time range. Min (ms) The time taken by the fastest transaction in the selected time range. Max (ms) The time taken by the slowest transaction in the selected time range. Total (ms) The total amount of time taken by all transactions that occurred in the selected time range. Total (% time) The total amount of time for all transactions of that type, expressed as a percentage of the total amount of time taken by all transactions. Dissat (%) The percentage of the transactions that did not have satisfied Apdex scores. If you view transactions as a table, the All transactions row always contributes 100% of the app's total dissatisfaction, even if no responses are dissatisfying (100% of zero is zero). In this situation, 100% does not mean that all of your transactions are dissatisfying. The sum of all the other values in the Dissat (%) column is 100%. Additional functions Here are some additional functions for the Transactions page's selected transaction. If you want to... Do this... View transactions for operations and other background tasks Change the Type to Other transactions (or a specific type listed), then select a specific transaction. The Transactions page shows the top five transactions for this selection by wall-clock time, CPU usage, and memory usage. Track a transaction that is important to your business Select the transaction's name, then select Track as key transaction. View transaction trace details A transaction trace is a complete picture of a single transaction. From the Transactions page, select the transaction trace. Select the view for Summary, Trace details, or Database queries, if available. To expand the transaction trace to full screen view, select the full screen icon. To return to the Transactions page: Next to the transaction trace's name, select the back arrow. Add or view transaction segments To add segments to a transaction, use custom instrumentation. To view the segments of a specific transaction, use transaction traces. View reports You can also use the Web transactions analysis report for web transactions and the Background jobs analysis report for non-web transactions to compare the amount of time spent in throughput, total time in the transaction, average time to execute it, and Apdex score as applicable. Delete all transaction traces Caution If you select Delete all traces, you cannot recover them.",

Let's look at what slow query data is, where to find it, and how to configure it. Slow query data samples When transaction traces are reported, the slow queries feature samples the slowest database queries in those traces and reports data about them on the Databases page. Slow query data can include: Duration of query segments Query/explain plans (if recognized) Host and instance level details (if supported by agent) View slow query data Tip To get a high-level overview of all your applications and services, use the New Relic Explorer. To see your slow query data: Do one of the following: New Relic Explorer: Go to one.newrelic.com > Explorer > (select an app) > Monitor > Databases. APM: Go to one.newrelic.com > APM > (select an app) > Monitor > Databases. Select a database transaction. If available, select any available slow queries listed on the page. If you do not see expected slow query data, follow the troubleshooting tips. Configuration In general, you can configure your slow query settings either of these ways: Agent configuration Server-side configuration (if available for your agent) Agent configuration gives you more options than server-side configuration does. How you choose to configure slow queries will depend on your own setup and preferences. For more information, see the documentation for the specific agent: C SDK You can report slow query traces for SQL databases only. For more information, see Instrument your application with the C SDK. Go Agent configuration options: Enable/disable: SlowQuery.Enabled Slow query threshold: SlowQuery.Threshold For other datastore config options, see Datastore tracer configuration. Java Agent configuration: Slow query threshold: explain_threshold. For other settings related to slow transactions and queries, see the Transaction tracer config options. You can also edit basic slow query settings via server-side configuration. .NET Agent configuration: Enable/disable: slowSql enabled Slow query threshold: explainThreshold For other settings related to slow transactions and queries, see the Transaction tracer config options and the Datastore tracer options.

Ruby Agent configuration: Enable/disable: slow_sql.enabled Slow query threshold: slow_sql.explain_threshold For other settings related to slow transactions and queries, see the Transaction tracer config options and the Slow SQL config options. If applicable for your application's agent language, you can also edit basic slow query settings by using server-side configuration. Slow queries metrics The slow queries list contains the following metrics: Metric Description Response time The average response time for the statements sampled. Sample count The number of slow queries identified in the sample. To view additional details, select an individual slow query: Metric Description Start time When the stack trace began collecting the data shown. Max time The maximum time for all similar query statements in the sample. Action The action or process invoking the query. Query The query that is being reported as slow. Depending on your configuration, some parts of the query may be obfuscated. Stack trace Where in the code the statement was called. For MySQL, we provide a query analysis, which explains what happened in your query and what you might do to speed it up. Other databases display an explain plan whenever possible. Troubleshooting: No slow query data If you do not see slow query data, it may be for any of these reasons: The slow query feature has been disabled. The threshold is set to too high a duration and no slow queries are being reported. The query obfuscation setting (usually record_sql or similar) may be set to Off.

Use the Explorer to access all your entities, that is, anything we can identify that reports data, from applications and hosts to custom groupings of any elements. Alternatively, you can go to one.newrelic.com > APM > (select an app). For more information, see the documentation about navigating core UI components in New Relic One. View app performance Use the Summary page for a quick summary of your website's performance. Overview charts Some charts include links to APM pages where you can drill down into additional details. APM Summary chart Comments Transactions response time This stacked chart represents the response time of web transactions or non-web transactions in your app. Segments in the chart vary depending on which agent you are using. Some charts may have an independent line for response time that represents the relationship between response time and total time. Also, for your external or background services, you may see data labeled as Web external. For more information about these out-of-process services, use the Externals page. Apdex score This chart measures the performance of your app based on its Apdex T value during the selected time window. To view additional details, hover over the question icon or the chart's End user and App server lines. The End user line charts the Apdex for your browser apps, and the App server line charts the Apdex for your APM apps. Throughput This chart illustrates the requests per minute for either web transactions or non-web transactions. To change the type of transaction, select the Transaction response time chart's dropdown arrow, then select Web or Non-web. Error rate This chart shows the number of errors that have occurred in the current time window. The tooltip that appears when you hover over the Error rate chart shows the combined throughput for both web and non-web transactions. To understand how error rate is calculated, see Application error rate example. Event markers Markers on the main Summary chart indicate events and changes to the app: Black vertical bar: Apdex settings have changed. Blue vertical bar: A deployment marker has been created or another event has occurred, such as a settings change for the app. Yellow or red area: This indicates alert thresholds have been violated. To view additional information, mouse over the marker. Drill-down details Use any of New Relic's standard page functions to drill down into detailed information. Here is a summary of additional options with the APM Summary page. If you want to... Do this... Change how data appears on the main chart Select the chart title's drop-down arrow, and then select your choice of view options, including histograms or percentiles if available. View threshold levels for your app's Apdex score Mouse over the Apdex score ? icon. For non-web transactions, the Apdex chart is blank because Apdex is not applicable to this class of apps. View trends in transaction time, Apdex, and throughput Select the Compare with yesterday and last week checkbox. The checkbox is only available when viewing the Web transaction response time chart with the time picker window Ending now. The checkbox is unavailable if you are viewing histograms, percentiles, or custom dates. View app performance since the last deployment From the time picker, select Performance since the last deployment. For detailed information about all deployments, select the Deployments page. View the Transactions page Select the Transactions table's heading on the APM Summary page. Or, to view details about a specific transaction (including operations, transaction traces, and key transactions), select its name. View the Databases or External services pages Click on a related time band in the Web transactions response time chart. View the Errors page Select the Error rate chart's title on the APM Summary page. You can also view the Errors page from one.newrelic.com > (select an app) > Events > Errors. Browser monitoring data If you install the browser agent via an APM agent, you can automatically link the browser-monitored app to the APM-monitored app. Once the browser agent is set up, the APM Summary page provides summary information and direct links to detailed information on the app's corresponding browser summary page. To view chart details with browser page load time, select the main chart's Browser link. To view the Apdex score for browsers, select the Apdex chart's Browser link. Link app performance to resources The APM Summary page shows a table with averages about your app's instances on their hosts, including: Apdex Response time Throughput Error rate CPU usage Memory Tip CPU usage percentage is calculated as though the application is running on one CPU core. For more information about this calculation, see CPU usage is over 100%. Examine app performance within system context Use any of these options to examine your app's performance within the context of your system's architecture and resources, such as individual hosts: Select your choice from the table at the bottom of the APM Summary page for infrastructure. Toggle between a table view or breakout metric details. If applicable, select your choice from the drop-down at the top of the APM Summary page for servers or JVMs. Examine details within infrastructure To help you understand the full context of your app's performance within your environment, APM includes options to view performance from inside the application, as well as from outside the application with the infrastructure agent. To view detailed information from your resources' point of view, click any host link. The link takes you directly to the infrastructure Compute page. When you click, the Compute data may not immediately appear. If that happens, follow the prompt to validate your account and complete the conversion process for the infrastructure agent. If you need additional help, get support at support.newrelic.com. Troubleshoot host link To troubleshoot the host link from the APM Summary page, use these tips: Host link from APM Summary Troubleshooting tips Your infrastructure agent is not installed on the host. Follow standard procedures to install our infrastructure agent. The application is operating within a container, and your infrastructure agent is installed on the container’s host. Set the hostname for the container to be the hostname of the underlying server. Docker containers: Run your Docker container with the argument: --uts=\"host\" Copy This will cause the container to share the UTS Linux Namespace with the underlying host. However, by using this set, a privileged container could change the host's hostname. The application is running on a Windows container, and your infrastructure agent is installed on the Windows host. To get a direct link to infrastructure metric data for your application, enable process metrics in the infrastructure agent's configuration. Your infrastructure agent is installed, but it only reports the short hostname, not the long hostname. Configure your server's hostname settings so that the infrastructure agent and the APM agent return the exact same name string. If possible, do so by editing your server's fully qualified domain name (FQDN) settings. The APM and infrastructure agents both read their hostname from the operating system's FQDN settings, so setting the hostname there ensures both agents share a single hostname. For more information, see the Java agent troubleshooting example.",

      "body": "APM's Transactions page helps you identify transactions that may be good candidates for fine-tuning performance problems or resolving errors. This page lists the selected app's transaction Requests, the top five transactions by percent of wall-clock time, and relevant throughputs (requests per minute or rpm). For non-web transactions (such as message processing, background tasks, and other processes and jobs that do not handle web requests), this page shows charts of CPU and memory usage. Types of transactions Tip To get a high-level overview of all your applications and services, use the New Relic Explorer. Depending on your selected application, the Transactions page may include a dropdown you can use to select from the types of transactions available. New Relic measures processing time by type of request (web transaction or non-web transaction). This may include: Web: App server requests Non-web: Other requests (operations, background tasks, etc.) The Transactions page also may include links to transaction traces and key transactions. The types of information available will depend on your selected app and the type of request (web or non-web). Wall-clock time Wall-clock time is the amount of time recorded by the clock. New Relic uses wall-clock time for all the transactions and then sums that value across all of the transactions. The host can execute requests in parallel, so you may see percentages over 100. For example, 100% would indicate that the execution time across all selected transactions is equal to the time expended when recording wall-clock time. View transactions To view information about your app's transaction requests: Do one of the following: Go to one.newrelic.com > APM > (select an app) > Monitor > Transactions. Go to one.newrelic.com > Explorer > (select an app) > Monitor > Transactions. If applicable: To change which available types of transactions appear, select the Type. Select the sort order, or keep the default. Select the type of view as a chart (default), histogram, or percentile, if available. To view additional details, use any of the transaction drill-down functions. To add a chart to a dashboard, mouse over the chart, then select the Add to a dashboard link that appears below it. If a chart's background is light red, this indicates a time period when an alert condition's Critical threshold has been violated. To view the incident details in New Relic Alerts, click the chart. For more information, see the documentation about navigating core UI components in New Relic One. Use drill-down functions Use any of New Relic's standard user interface functions to drill down into detailed information. The Transactions page has additional drill-down functions. Change the displayed transaction Type If the Type dropdown appears above list of transactions, you can select your choice of transaction type. The available types depend on what transactions your application uses. Select the type of performance measurement (Sort) The Sort dropdown above the transaction list allows you to review transactions according to different measurements. This helps you identify good candidates for performance tuning or fixing errors. You can sort by: Sort option Comments Most time consuming (default) Highest percentage of the app's total time used. This measures which transactions consumed the most time in total. This is calculated by multiplying the number of times the transaction is called by the time the transaction took to complete. A transaction could be short, but if it is frequently called, it would appear at the top of this ranking. Slowest average response time Slowest individual transactions for the time period as averaged. This measures the slowest types of transaction. A transaction could be called only a few times, but if it is one of the longest transactions to finish, it would appear at the top of this ranking. Apdex most dissatisfying Transactions with the highest percentages of user dissatisfaction levels for the response time of your web apps and services (Apdex). The dissatisfaction level is the difference between a perfect Apdex score (1.0) and your app's apdex_t (\"tolerating\") score, based on your Apdex settings. Transactions that have the highest (worst) percentages appear at the top of this ranking. Highest throughput This measures the amount of throughput, in operation requests per minute or rpm. (For web throughput, requests per minute is sometimes called pages per minute or ppm.) Transactions that have the highest number of requests per minute appear at the top of this ranking. Tip Depending on the transaction type you choose, different sort options may be available. Mouse over summary information about a transaction To quickly view key pieces of information about the transaction, mouse over its name on the list. Select detailed information about a transaction To view detailed information, select a transaction from the list, then select App performance or Historical performance. You can also view transaction traces. View transaction data in different visual formats The Transaction page's Top 5 transactions chart and a selected transaction's App performance window include options to view data as a: Chart Histogram Percentile In addition, from the Breakdown table for a selected transaction, you can select the link to show or hide all segments of the breakdown data. Show corresponding browser request data In order to view browser information, you must install the browser agent. Then, to view corresponding browser request data, use either of these options: Select the Browser drill-down link if available. Go to one.newrelic.com > Browser > (select an app) > Page views. Identify transaction segments with high call counts or time In a transaction's Breakdown table, the Avg calls (per txn) column may include colorized segment values. These indicate instrumented segments that have exceeded thresholds. Yellow: Segment time is more than 10% of total transaction time and call count is higher than 10. Red: Segment time is more than 10% of total transaction time and call count is higher than 20. Show all transactions To view all available transactions as a table, select the Show all transactions table link. From here, use any of the available options: To change the sort order, select any column header. To export the data to a file with comma-separated values, select Export as CSV. To return to the previous chart view, select Back to top transactions. CSV tables for ending now time periods are calculated at run time. They may show slightly higher values than what appears in the APM table. For each transaction, the Show all transactions table includes these measurements: Measurement Definition Apdex The average Apdex score for all transactions that occurred in the selected time range. Apdex scores marked with an * asterisk indicate the agent collected fewer than 100 samples for that transaction name. Data for these transactions may be less accurate than data for transactions with higher throughput. Count The total number of all transactions that occurred in the selected time range. Avg (ms) The average time taken by all transactions in the selected time range. SD (ms) The standard deviation of all timing measurements for all transactions in the selected time range. Min (ms) The time taken by the fastest transaction in the selected time range. Max (ms) The time taken by the slowest transaction in the selected time range. Total (ms) The total amount of time taken by all transactions that occurred in the selected time range. Total (% time) The total amount of time for all transactions of that type, expressed as a percentage of the total amount of time taken by all transactions. Dissat (%) The percentage of the transactions that did not have satisfied Apdex scores. If you view transactions as a table, the All transactions row always contributes 100% of the app's total dissatisfaction, even if no responses are dissatisfying (100% of zero is zero). In this situation, 100% does not mean that all of your transactions are dissatisfying. The sum of all the other values in the Dissat (%) column is 100%. Additional functions Here are some additional functions for the Transactions page's selected transaction. If you want to... Do this... View transactions for operations and other background tasks Change the Type to Other transactions (or a specific type listed), then select a specific transaction. The Transactions page shows the top five transactions for this selection by wall-clock time, CPU usage, and memory usage. Track a transaction that is important to your business Select the transaction's name, then select Track as key transaction. View transaction trace details A transaction trace is a complete picture of a single transaction. From the Transactions page, select the transaction trace. Select the view for Summary, Trace details, or Database queries, if available. To expand the transaction trace to full screen view, select the full screen icon. To return to the Transactions page: Next to the transaction trace's name, select the back arrow. Add or view transaction segments To add segments to a transaction, use custom instrumentation. To view the segments of a specific transaction, use transaction traces. View reports You can also use the Web transactions analysis report for web transactions and the Background jobs analysis report for non-web transactions to compare the amount of time spent in throughput, total time in the transaction, average time to execute it, and Apdex score as applicable. Delete all transaction traces Caution If you select Delete all traces, you cannot recover them.",

If applicable for your application's agent language, you can also edit basic slow query settings by using server-side configuration. Slow queries metrics The slow queries list contains the following metrics: Metric Description Response time The average response time for the statements sampled. Sample count The number of slow queries identified in the sample. To view additional details, select an individual slow query: Metric Description Start time When the stack trace began collecting the data shown. Max time The maximum time for all similar query statements in the sample. Action The action or process invoking the query. Query The query that is being reported as slow. Depending on your configuration, some parts of the query may be obfuscated. Stack trace Where in the code the statement was called. For MySQL, we provide a query analysis, which explains what happened in your query and what you might do to speed it up. Other databases display an explain plan whenever possible. Troubleshooting: No slow query data If you do not see slow query data, it may be for any of these reasons: The slow query feature has been disabled. The threshold is set to too high a duration and no slow queries are being reported. The query obfuscation setting (usually record_sql or similar) may be set to Off.

Or, to view details about a specific transaction (including operations, transaction traces, and key transactions), select its name. View the Databases or External services pages Click on a related time band in the Web transactions response time chart. View the Errors page Select the Error rate chart's title on the APM Summary page. You can also view the Errors page from one.newrelic.com > (select an app) > Events > Errors. Browser monitoring data If you install the browser agent via an APM agent, you can automatically link the browser-monitored app to the APM-monitored app. Once the browser agent is set up, the APM Summary page provides summary information and direct links to detailed information on the app's corresponding browser summary page. To view chart details with browser page load time, select the main chart's Browser link. To view the Apdex score for browsers, select the Apdex chart's Browser link. Link app performance to resources The APM Summary page shows a table with averages about your app's instances on their hosts, including: Apdex Response time Throughput Error rate CPU usage Memory Tip CPU usage percentage is calculated as though the application is running on one CPU core. For more information about this calculation, see CPU usage is over 100%. Examine app performance within system context Use any of these options to examine your app's performance within the context of your system's architecture and resources, such as individual hosts: Select your choice from the table at the bottom of the APM Summary page for infrastructure. Toggle between a table view or breakout metric details. If applicable, select your choice from the drop-down at the top of the APM Summary page for servers or JVMs. Examine details within infrastructure To help you understand the full context of your app's performance within your environment, APM includes options to view performance from inside the application, as well as from outside the application with the infrastructure agent. To view detailed information from your resources' point of view, click any host link. The link takes you directly to the infrastructure Compute page. When you click, the Compute data may not immediately appear. If that happens, follow the prompt to validate your account and complete the conversion process for the infrastructure agent. If you need additional help, get support at support.newrelic.com. Troubleshoot host link To troubleshoot the host link from the APM Summary page, use these tips: Host link from APM Summary Troubleshooting tips Your infrastructure agent is not installed on the host. Follow standard procedures to install our infrastructure agent. The application is operating within a container, and your infrastructure agent is installed on the container’s host. Set the hostname for the container to be the hostname of the underlying server. Docker containers: Run your Docker container with the argument: --uts=\"host\" Copy This will cause the container to share the UTS Linux Namespace with the underlying host. However, by using this set, a privileged container could change the host's hostname. The application is running on a Windows container, and your infrastructure agent is installed on the Windows host. To get a direct link to infrastructure metric data for your application, enable process metrics in the infrastructure agent's configuration. Your infrastructure agent is installed, but it only reports the short hostname, not the long hostname. Configure your server's hostname settings so that the infrastructure agent and the APM agent return the exact same name string. If possible, do so by editing your server's fully qualified domain name (FQDN) settings. The APM and infrastructure agents both read their hostname from the operating system's FQDN settings, so setting the hostname there ensures both agents share a single hostname. For more information, see the Java agent troubleshooting example.",

      "body": "APM's Transactions page helps you identify transactions that may be good candidates for fine-tuning performance problems or resolving errors. This page lists the selected app's transaction Requests, the top five transactions by percent of wall-clock time, and relevant throughputs (requests per minute or rpm). For non-web transactions (such as message processing, background tasks, and other processes and jobs that do not handle web requests), this page shows charts of CPU and memory usage. Types of transactions Tip To get a high-level overview of all your applications and services, use the New Relic Explorer. Depending on your selected application, the Transactions page may include a dropdown you can use to select from the types of transactions available. New Relic measures processing time by type of request (web transaction or non-web transaction). This may include: Web: App server requests Non-web: Other requests (operations, background tasks, etc.) The Transactions page also may include links to transaction traces and key transactions. The types of information available will depend on your selected app and the type of request (web or non-web). Wall-clock time Wall-clock time is the amount of time recorded by the clock. New Relic uses wall-clock time for all the transactions and then sums that value across all of the transactions. The host can execute requests in parallel, so you may see percentages over 100. For example, 100% would indicate that the execution time across all selected transactions is equal to the time expended when recording wall-clock time. View transactions To view information about your app's transaction requests: Do one of the following: Go to one.newrelic.com > APM > (select an app) > Monitor > Transactions. Go to one.newrelic.com > Explorer > (select an app) > Monitor > Transactions. If applicable: To change which available types of transactions appear, select the Type. Select the sort order, or keep the default. Select the type of view as a chart (default), histogram, or percentile, if available. To view additional details, use any of the transaction drill-down functions. To add a chart to a dashboard, mouse over the chart, then select the Add to a dashboard link that appears below it. If a chart's background is light red, this indicates a time period when an alert condition's Critical threshold has been violated. To view the incident details in New Relic Alerts, click the chart. For more information, see the documentation about navigating core UI components in New Relic One. Use drill-down functions Use any of New Relic's standard user interface functions to drill down into detailed information. The Transactions page has additional drill-down functions. Change the displayed transaction Type If the Type dropdown appears above list of transactions, you can select your choice of transaction type. The available types depend on what transactions your application uses. Select the type of performance measurement (Sort) The Sort dropdown above the transaction list allows you to review transactions according to different measurements. This helps you identify good candidates for performance tuning or fixing errors. You can sort by: Sort option Comments Most time consuming (default) Highest percentage of the app's total time used. This measures which transactions consumed the most time in total. This is calculated by multiplying the number of times the transaction is called by the time the transaction took to complete. A transaction could be short, but if it is frequently called, it would appear at the top of this ranking. Slowest average response time Slowest individual transactions for the time period as averaged. This measures the slowest types of transaction. A transaction could be called only a few times, but if it is one of the longest transactions to finish, it would appear at the top of this ranking. Apdex most dissatisfying Transactions with the highest percentages of user dissatisfaction levels for the response time of your web apps and services (Apdex). The dissatisfaction level is the difference between a perfect Apdex score (1.0) and your app's apdex_t (\"tolerating\") score, based on your Apdex settings. Transactions that have the highest (worst) percentages appear at the top of this ranking. Highest throughput This measures the amount of throughput, in operation requests per minute or rpm. (For web throughput, requests per minute is sometimes called pages per minute or ppm.) Transactions that have the highest number of requests per minute appear at the top of this ranking. Tip Depending on the transaction type you choose, different sort options may be available. Mouse over summary information about a transaction To quickly view key pieces of information about the transaction, mouse over its name on the list. Select detailed information about a transaction To view detailed information, select a transaction from the list, then select App performance or Historical performance. You can also view transaction traces. View transaction data in different visual formats The Transaction page's Top 5 transactions chart and a selected transaction's App performance window include options to view data as a: Chart Histogram Percentile In addition, from the Breakdown table for a selected transaction, you can select the link to show or hide all segments of the breakdown data. Show corresponding browser request data In order to view browser information, you must install the browser agent. Then, to view corresponding browser request data, use either of these options: Select the Browser drill-down link if available. Go to one.newrelic.com > Browser > (select an app) > Page views. Identify transaction segments with high call counts or time In a transaction's Breakdown table, the Avg calls (per txn) column may include colorized segment values. These indicate instrumented segments that have exceeded thresholds. Yellow: Segment time is more than 10% of total transaction time and call count is higher than 10. Red: Segment time is more than 10% of total transaction time and call count is higher than 20. Show all transactions To view all available transactions as a table, select the Show all transactions table link. From here, use any of the available options: To change the sort order, select any column header. To export the data to a file with comma-separated values, select Export as CSV. To return to the previous chart view, select Back to top transactions. CSV tables for ending now time periods are calculated at run time. They may show slightly higher values than what appears in the APM table. For each transaction, the Show all transactions table includes these measurements: Measurement Definition Apdex The average Apdex score for all transactions that occurred in the selected time range. Apdex scores marked with an * asterisk indicate the agent collected fewer than 100 samples for that transaction name. Data for these transactions may be less accurate than data for transactions with higher throughput. Count The total number of all transactions that occurred in the selected time range. Avg (ms) The average time taken by all transactions in the selected time range. SD (ms) The standard deviation of all timing measurements for all transactions in the selected time range. Min (ms) The time taken by the fastest transaction in the selected time range. Max (ms) The time taken by the slowest transaction in the selected time range. Total (ms) The total amount of time taken by all transactions that occurred in the selected time range. Total (% time) The total amount of time for all transactions of that type, expressed as a percentage of the total amount of time taken by all transactions. Dissat (%) The percentage of the transactions that did not have satisfied Apdex scores. If you view transactions as a table, the All transactions row always contributes 100% of the app's total dissatisfaction, even if no responses are dissatisfying (100% of zero is zero). In this situation, 100% does not mean that all of your transactions are dissatisfying. The sum of all the other values in the Dissat (%) column is 100%. Additional functions Here are some additional functions for the Transactions page's selected transaction. If you want to... Do this... View transactions for operations and other background tasks Change the Type to Other transactions (or a specific type listed), then select a specific transaction. The Transactions page shows the top five transactions for this selection by wall-clock time, CPU usage, and memory usage. Track a transaction that is important to your business Select the transaction's name, then select Track as key transaction. View transaction trace details A transaction trace is a complete picture of a single transaction. From the Transactions page, select the transaction trace. Select the view for Summary, Trace details, or Database queries, if available. To expand the transaction trace to full screen view, select the full screen icon. To return to the Transactions page: Next to the transaction trace's name, select the back arrow. Add or view transaction segments To add segments to a transaction, use custom instrumentation. To view the segments of a specific transaction, use transaction traces. View reports You can also use the Web transactions analysis report for web transactions and the Background jobs analysis report for non-web transactions to compare the amount of time spent in throughput, total time in the transaction, average time to execute it, and Apdex score as applicable. Delete all transaction traces Caution If you select Delete all traces, you cannot recover them.",

Slow queries metrics The slow queries list contains the following metrics: Metric Description Response time The average response time for the statements sampled. Sample count The number of slow queries identified in the sample. To view additional details, select an individual slow query: Metric Description Start time When the stack trace began collecting the data shown. Max time The maximum time for all similar query statements in the sample. Action The action or process invoking the query. Query The query that is being reported as slow. Depending on your configuration, some parts of the query may be obfuscated. Stack trace Where in the code the statement was called. For MySQL, we provide a query analysis, which explains what happened in your query and what you might do to speed it up. Other databases display an explain plan whenever possible. Troubleshooting: No slow query data If you do not see slow query data, it may be for any of these reasons: The slow query feature has been disabled. The threshold is set to too high a duration and no slow queries are being reported. The query obfuscation setting (usually record_sql or similar) may be set to Off.

View app performance Use the Summary page for a quick summary of your website's performance. Overview charts Some charts include links to APM pages where you can drill down into additional details. APM Summary chart Comments Transactions response time This stacked chart represents the response time of web transactions or non-web transactions in your app. Segments in the chart vary depending on which agent you are using. Some charts may have an independent line for response time that represents the relationship between response time and total time. Also, for your external or background services, you may see data labeled as Web external. For more information about these out-of-process services, use the Externals page. Apdex score This chart measures the performance of your app based on its Apdex T value during the selected time window. To view additional details, hover over the question icon or the chart's End user and App server lines. The End user line charts the Apdex for your browser apps, and the App server line charts the Apdex for your APM apps. Throughput This chart illustrates the requests per minute for either web transactions or non-web transactions. To change the type of transaction, select the Transaction response time chart's dropdown arrow, then select Web or Non-web. Error rate This chart shows the number of errors that have occurred in the current time window. The tooltip that appears when you hover over the Error rate chart shows the combined throughput for both web and non-web transactions. To understand how error rate is calculated, see Application error rate example. Event markers Markers on the main Summary chart indicate events and changes to the app: Black vertical bar: Apdex settings have changed. Blue vertical bar: A deployment marker has been created or another event has occurred, such as a settings change for the app. Yellow or red area: This indicates alert thresholds have been violated.

Set the hostname for the container to be the hostname of the underlying server. Docker containers: Run your Docker container with the argument: --uts=\"host\" Copy This will cause the container to share the UTS Linux Namespace with the underlying host. However, by using this set, a privileged container could change the host's hostname. The application is running on a Windows container, and your infrastructure agent is installed on the Windows host. To get a direct link to infrastructure metric data for your application, enable process metrics in the infrastructure agent's configuration. Your infrastructure agent is installed, but it only reports the short hostname, not the long hostname. Configure your server's hostname settings so that the infrastructure agent and the APM agent return the exact same name string. If possible, do so by editing your server's fully qualified domain name (FQDN) settings. The APM and infrastructure agents both read their hostname from the operating system's FQDN settings, so setting the hostname there ensures both agents share a single hostname.

Let's look at what slow query data is, where to find it, and how to configure it. Slow query data samples When transaction traces are reported, the slow queries feature samples the slowest database queries in those traces and reports data about them on the Databases page. Slow query data can include: Duration of query segments Query/explain plans (if recognized) Host and instance level details (if supported by agent) View slow query data Tip To get a high-level overview of all your applications and services, use the New Relic Explorer. To see your slow query data: Do one of the following: New Relic Explorer: Go to one.newrelic.com > Explorer > (select an app) > Monitor > Databases. APM: Go to one.newrelic.com > APM > (select an app) > Monitor > Databases. Select a database transaction. If available, select any available slow queries listed on the page. If you do not see expected slow query data, follow the troubleshooting tips. Configuration In general, you can configure your slow query settings either of these ways: Agent configuration Server-side configuration (if available for your agent) Agent configuration gives you more options than server-side configuration does. How you choose to configure slow queries will depend on your own setup and preferences. For more information, see the documentation for the specific agent: C SDK You can report slow query traces for SQL databases only. For more information, see Instrument your application with the C SDK. Go Agent configuration options: Enable/disable: SlowQuery.Enabled Slow query threshold: SlowQuery.Threshold For other datastore config options, see Datastore tracer configuration. Java Agent configuration: Slow query threshold: explain_threshold. For other settings related to slow transactions and queries, see the Transaction tracer config options. You can also edit basic slow query settings via server-side configuration. .NET Agent configuration: Enable/disable: slowSql enabled Slow query threshold: explainThreshold For other settings related to slow transactions and queries, see the Transaction tracer config options and the Datastore tracer options. You can also edit basic slow query settings via server-side configuration. Node.js Agent configuration: Enable/disable: enabled Threshold: explain_threshold Maximum slow query samples: max_samples For other settings related to slow transactions and queries, see the Transaction tracer config options. Server-side configuration of slow query data is not possible for the Node.js agent. PHP Agent configuration: Enable/disable: slow_sql Threshold: explain_threshold For other settings related to slow transactions and queries, see the Transaction tracer config options. Server-side configuration is not possible for the PHP agent. Python Agent configuration: Slow query threshold: explain_threshold For other settings related to slow transactions and queries, see the Transaction tracer config options and the Datastore tracer options. You can also edit basic slow query settings via server-side configuration. Ruby Agent configuration: Enable/disable: slow_sql.enabled Slow query threshold: slow_sql.explain_threshold For other settings related to slow transactions and queries, see the Transaction tracer config options and the Slow SQL config options. If applicable for your application's agent language, you can also edit basic slow query settings by using server-side configuration. Slow queries metrics The slow queries list contains the following metrics: Metric Description Response time The average response time for the statements sampled. Sample count The number of slow queries identified in the sample. To view additional details, select an individual slow query: Metric Description Start time When the stack trace began collecting the data shown. Max time The maximum time for all similar query statements in the sample. Action The action or process invoking the query. Query The query that is being reported as slow. Depending on your configuration, some parts of the query may be obfuscated. Stack trace Where in the code the statement was called. For MySQL, we provide a query analysis, which explains what happened in your query and what you might do to speed it up. Other databases display an explain plan whenever possible. Troubleshooting: No slow query data If you do not see slow query data, it may be for any of these reasons: The slow query feature has been disabled. The threshold is set to too high a duration and no slow queries are being reported. The query obfuscation setting (usually record_sql or similar) may be set to Off. To solve the problem, try adjusting the configuration options.",

Tip To get a high-level overview of all your applications and services, use the New Relic explorer. View your app's summary page To reach the Summary page, go to one.newrelic.com > Explorer > Services - APM > (select an app). Use the Explorer to access all your entities, that is, anything we can identify that reports data, from applications and hosts to custom groupings of any elements. Alternatively, you can go to one.newrelic.com > APM > (select an app). For more information, see the documentation about navigating core UI components in New Relic One. View app performance Use the Summary page for a quick summary of your website's performance. Overview charts Some charts include links to APM pages where you can drill down into additional details. APM Summary chart Comments Transactions response time This stacked chart represents the response time of web transactions or non-web transactions in your app. Segments in the chart vary depending on which agent you are using. Some charts may have an independent line for response time that represents the relationship between response time and total time. Also, for your external or background services, you may see data labeled as Web external. For more information about these out-of-process services, use the Externals page. Apdex score This chart measures the performance of your app based on its Apdex T value during the selected time window. To view additional details, hover over the question icon or the chart's End user and App server lines. The End user line charts the Apdex for your browser apps, and the App server line charts the Apdex for your APM apps. Throughput This chart illustrates the requests per minute for either web transactions or non-web transactions. To change the type of transaction, select the Transaction response time chart's dropdown arrow, then select Web or Non-web. Error rate This chart shows the number of errors that have occurred in the current time window. The tooltip that appears when you hover over the Error rate chart shows the combined throughput for both web and non-web transactions. To understand how error rate is calculated, see Application error rate example. Event markers Markers on the main Summary chart indicate events and changes to the app: Black vertical bar: Apdex settings have changed. Blue vertical bar: A deployment marker has been created or another event has occurred, such as a settings change for the app. Yellow or red area: This indicates alert thresholds have been violated. To view additional information, mouse over the marker. Drill-down details Use any of New Relic's standard page functions to drill down into detailed information. Here is a summary of additional options with the APM Summary page. If you want to... Do this... Change how data appears on the main chart Select the chart title's drop-down arrow, and then select your choice of view options, including histograms or percentiles if available. View threshold levels for your app's Apdex score Mouse over the Apdex score ? icon. For non-web transactions, the Apdex chart is blank because Apdex is not applicable to this class of apps. View trends in transaction time, Apdex, and throughput Select the Compare with yesterday and last week checkbox. The checkbox is only available when viewing the Web transaction response time chart with the time picker window Ending now. The checkbox is unavailable if you are viewing histograms, percentiles, or custom dates. View app performance since the last deployment From the time picker, select Performance since the last deployment. For detailed information about all deployments, select the Deployments page. View the Transactions page Select the Transactions table's heading on the APM Summary page. Or, to view details about a specific transaction (including operations, transaction traces, and key transactions), select its name. View the Databases or External services pages Click on a related time band in the Web transactions response time chart. View the Errors page Select the Error rate chart's title on the APM Summary page. You can also view the Errors page from one.newrelic.com > (select an app) > Events > Errors. Browser monitoring data If you install the browser agent via an APM agent, you can automatically link the browser-monitored app to the APM-monitored app. Once the browser agent is set up, the APM Summary page provides summary information and direct links to detailed information on the app's corresponding browser summary page. To view chart details with browser page load time, select the main chart's Browser link. To view the Apdex score for browsers, select the Apdex chart's Browser link. Link app performance to resources The APM Summary page shows a table with averages about your app's instances on their hosts, including: Apdex Response time Throughput Error rate CPU usage Memory Tip CPU usage percentage is calculated as though the application is running on one CPU core. For more information about this calculation, see CPU usage is over 100%. Examine app performance within system context Use any of these options to examine your app's performance within the context of your system's architecture and resources, such as individual hosts: Select your choice from the table at the bottom of the APM Summary page for infrastructure. Toggle between a table view or breakout metric details. If applicable, select your choice from the drop-down at the top of the APM Summary page for servers or JVMs. Examine details within infrastructure To help you understand the full context of your app's performance within your environment, APM includes options to view performance from inside the application, as well as from outside the application with the infrastructure agent. To view detailed information from your resources' point of view, click any host link. The link takes you directly to the infrastructure Compute page. When you click, the Compute data may not immediately appear. If that happens, follow the prompt to validate your account and complete the conversion process for the infrastructure agent. If you need additional help, get support at support.newrelic.com. Troubleshoot host link To troubleshoot the host link from the APM Summary page, use these tips: Host link from APM Summary Troubleshooting tips Your infrastructure agent is not installed on the host. Follow standard procedures to install our infrastructure agent. The application is operating within a container, and your infrastructure agent is installed on the container’s host. Set the hostname for the container to be the hostname of the underlying server.

      "body": "APM's Transactions page helps you identify transactions that may be good candidates for fine-tuning performance problems or resolving errors. This page lists the selected app's transaction Requests, the top five transactions by percent of wall-clock time, and relevant throughputs (requests per minute or rpm). For non-web transactions (such as message processing, background tasks, and other processes and jobs that do not handle web requests), this page shows charts of CPU and memory usage. Types of transactions Tip To get a high-level overview of all your applications and services, use the New Relic Explorer. Depending on your selected application, the Transactions page may include a dropdown you can use to select from the types of transactions available. New Relic measures processing time by type of request (web transaction or non-web transaction). This may include: Web: App server requests Non-web: Other requests (operations, background tasks, etc.) The Transactions page also may include links to transaction traces and key transactions. The types of information available will depend on your selected app and the type of request (web or non-web). Wall-clock time Wall-clock time is the amount of time recorded by the clock. New Relic uses wall-clock time for all the transactions and then sums that value across all of the transactions. The host can execute requests in parallel, so you may see percentages over 100. For example, 100% would indicate that the execution time across all selected transactions is equal to the time expended when recording wall-clock time. View transactions To view information about your app's transaction requests: Do one of the following: Go to one.newrelic.com > APM > (select an app) > Monitor > Transactions. Go to one.newrelic.com > Explorer > (select an app) > Monitor > Transactions. If applicable: To change which available types of transactions appear, select the Type. Select the sort order, or keep the default. Select the type of view as a chart (default), histogram, or percentile, if available. To view additional details, use any of the transaction drill-down functions. To add a chart to a dashboard, mouse over the chart, then select the Add to a dashboard link that appears below it. If a chart's background is light red, this indicates a time period when an alert condition's Critical threshold has been violated. To view the incident details in New Relic Alerts, click the chart. For more information, see the documentation about navigating core UI components in New Relic One. Use drill-down functions Use any of New Relic's standard user interface functions to drill down into detailed information. The Transactions page has additional drill-down functions. Change the displayed transaction Type If the Type dropdown appears above list of transactions, you can select your choice of transaction type. The available types depend on what transactions your application uses. Select the type of performance measurement (Sort) The Sort dropdown above the transaction list allows you to review transactions according to different measurements. This helps you identify good candidates for performance tuning or fixing errors. You can sort by: Sort option Comments Most time consuming (default) Highest percentage of the app's total time used. This measures which transactions consumed the most time in total. This is calculated by multiplying the number of times the transaction is called by the time the transaction took to complete. A transaction could be short, but if it is frequently called, it would appear at the top of this ranking. Slowest average response time Slowest individual transactions for the time period as averaged. This measures the slowest types of transaction. A transaction could be called only a few times, but if it is one of the longest transactions to finish, it would appear at the top of this ranking. Apdex most dissatisfying Transactions with the highest percentages of user dissatisfaction levels for the response time of your web apps and services (Apdex). The dissatisfaction level is the difference between a perfect Apdex score (1.0) and your app's apdex_t (\"tolerating\") score, based on your Apdex settings. Transactions that have the highest (worst) percentages appear at the top of this ranking. Highest throughput This measures the amount of throughput, in operation requests per minute or rpm. (For web throughput, requests per minute is sometimes called pages per minute or ppm.) Transactions that have the highest number of requests per minute appear at the top of this ranking. Tip Depending on the transaction type you choose, different sort options may be available. Mouse over summary information about a transaction To quickly view key pieces of information about the transaction, mouse over its name on the list. Select detailed information about a transaction To view detailed information, select a transaction from the list, then select App performance or Historical performance. You can also view transaction traces. View transaction data in different visual formats The Transaction page's Top 5 transactions chart and a selected transaction's App performance window include options to view data as a: Chart Histogram Percentile In addition, from the Breakdown table for a selected transaction, you can select the link to show or hide all segments of the breakdown data. Show corresponding browser request data In order to view browser information, you must install the browser agent. Then, to view corresponding browser request data, use either of these options: Select the Browser drill-down link if available. Go to one.newrelic.com > Browser > (select an app) > Page views. Identify transaction segments with high call counts or time In a transaction's Breakdown table, the Avg calls (per txn) column may include colorized segment values. These indicate instrumented segments that have exceeded thresholds. Yellow: Segment time is more than 10% of total transaction time and call count is higher than 10. Red: Segment time is more than 10% of total transaction time and call count is higher than 20. Show all transactions To view all available transactions as a table, select the Show all transactions table link. From here, use any of the available options: To change the sort order, select any column header. To export the data to a file with comma-separated values, select Export as CSV. To return to the previous chart view, select Back to top transactions. CSV tables for ending now time periods are calculated at run time. They may show slightly higher values than what appears in the APM table. For each transaction, the Show all transactions table includes these measurements: Measurement Definition Apdex The average Apdex score for all transactions that occurred in the selected time range. Apdex scores marked with an * asterisk indicate the agent collected fewer than 100 samples for that transaction name. Data for these transactions may be less accurate than data for transactions with higher throughput. Count The total number of all transactions that occurred in the selected time range. Avg (ms) The average time taken by all transactions in the selected time range. SD (ms) The standard deviation of all timing measurements for all transactions in the selected time range. Min (ms) The time taken by the fastest transaction in the selected time range. Max (ms) The time taken by the slowest transaction in the selected time range. Total (ms) The total amount of time taken by all transactions that occurred in the selected time range. Total (% time) The total amount of time for all transactions of that type, expressed as a percentage of the total amount of time taken by all transactions. Dissat (%) The percentage of the transactions that did not have satisfied Apdex scores.

      "body": "The APM Summary page provides general information about the selected app, including web transactions and non-web transactions, Apdex score, CPU usage, throughput (requests per minute or rpm), transaction times, error rate, application activity, and hosts. Tip To get a high-level overview of all your applications and services, use the New Relic explorer. View your app's summary page To reach the Summary page, go to one.newrelic.com > Explorer > Services - APM > (select an app). Use the Explorer to access all your entities, that is, anything we can identify that reports data, from applications and hosts to custom groupings of any elements. Alternatively, you can go to one.newrelic.com > APM > (select an app). For more information, see the documentation about navigating core UI components in New Relic One. View app performance Use the Summary page for a quick summary of your website's performance. Overview charts Some charts include links to APM pages where you can drill down into additional details. APM Summary chart Comments Transactions response time This stacked chart represents the response time of web transactions or non-web transactions in your app. Segments in the chart vary depending on which agent you are using. Some charts may have an independent line for response time that represents the relationship between response time and total time. Also, for your external or background services, you may see data labeled as Web external. For more information about these out-of-process services, use the Externals page. Apdex score This chart measures the performance of your app based on its Apdex T value during the selected time window. To view additional details, hover over the question icon or the chart's End user and App server lines. The End user line charts the Apdex for your browser apps, and the App server line charts the Apdex for your APM apps. Throughput This chart illustrates the requests per minute for either web transactions or non-web transactions. To change the type of transaction, select the Transaction response time chart's dropdown arrow, then select Web or Non-web. Error rate This chart shows the number of errors that have occurred in the current time window. The tooltip that appears when you hover over the Error rate chart shows the combined throughput for both web and non-web transactions. To understand how error rate is calculated, see Application error rate example. Event markers Markers on the main Summary chart indicate events and changes to the app: Black vertical bar: Apdex settings have changed. Blue vertical bar: A deployment marker has been created or another event has occurred, such as a settings change for the app. Yellow or red area: This indicates alert thresholds have been violated. To view additional information, mouse over the marker. Drill-down details Use any of New Relic's standard page functions to drill down into detailed information. Here is a summary of additional options with the APM Summary page. If you want to... Do this... Change how data appears on the main chart Select the chart title's drop-down arrow, and then select your choice of view options, including histograms or percentiles if available. View threshold levels for your app's Apdex score Mouse over the Apdex score ? icon. For non-web transactions, the Apdex chart is blank because Apdex is not applicable to this class of apps. View trends in transaction time, Apdex, and throughput Select the Compare with yesterday and last week checkbox. The checkbox is only available when viewing the Web transaction response time chart with the time picker window Ending now. The checkbox is unavailable if you are viewing histograms, percentiles, or custom dates. View app performance since the last deployment From the time picker, select Performance since the last deployment. For detailed information about all deployments, select the Deployments page. View the Transactions page Select the Transactions table's heading on the APM Summary page. Or, to view details about a specific transaction (including operations, transaction traces, and key transactions), select its name. View the Databases or External services pages Click on a related time band in the Web transactions response time chart. View the Errors page Select the Error rate chart's title on the APM Summary page. You can also view the Errors page from one.newrelic.com > (select an app) > Events > Errors. Browser monitoring data If you install the browser agent via an APM agent, you can automatically link the browser-monitored app to the APM-monitored app. Once the browser agent is set up, the APM Summary page provides summary information and direct links to detailed information on the app's corresponding browser summary page. To view chart details with browser page load time, select the main chart's Browser link. To view the Apdex score for browsers, select the Apdex chart's Browser link. Link app performance to resources The APM Summary page shows a table with averages about your app's instances on their hosts, including: Apdex Response time Throughput Error rate CPU usage Memory Tip CPU usage percentage is calculated as though the application is running on one CPU core. For more information about this calculation, see CPU usage is over 100%. Examine app performance within system context Use any of these options to examine your app's performance within the context of your system's architecture and resources, such as individual hosts: Select your choice from the table at the bottom of the APM Summary page for infrastructure. Toggle between a table view or breakout metric details. If applicable, select your choice from the drop-down at the top of the APM Summary page for servers or JVMs. Examine details within infrastructure To help you understand the full context of your app's performance within your environment, APM includes options to view performance from inside the application, as well as from outside the application with the infrastructure agent. To view detailed information from your resources' point of view, click any host link. The link takes you directly to the infrastructure Compute page. When you click, the Compute data may not immediately appear. If that happens, follow the prompt to validate your account and complete the conversion process for the infrastructure agent. If you need additional help, get support at support.newrelic.com. Troubleshoot host link To troubleshoot the host link from the APM Summary page, use these tips: Host link from APM Summary Troubleshooting tips Your infrastructure agent is not installed on the host. Follow standard procedures to install our infrastructure agent. The application is operating within a container, and your infrastructure agent is installed on the container’s host. Set the hostname for the container to be the hostname of the underlying server. Docker containers: Run your Docker container with the argument: --uts=\"host\" Copy This will cause the container to share the UTS Linux Namespace with the underlying host. However, by using this set, a privileged container could change the host's hostname. The application is running on a Windows container, and your infrastructure agent is installed on the Windows host. To get a direct link to infrastructure metric data for your application, enable process metrics in the infrastructure agent's configuration. Your infrastructure agent is installed, but it only reports the short hostname, not the long hostname. Configure your server's hostname settings so that the infrastructure agent and the APM agent return the exact same name string. If possible, do so by editing your server's fully qualified domain name (FQDN) settings. The APM and infrastructure agents both read their hostname from the operating system's FQDN settings, so setting the hostname there ensures both agents share a single hostname. For more information, see the Java agent troubleshooting example.",

      "body": "APM's Transactions page helps you identify transactions that may be good candidates for fine-tuning performance problems or resolving errors. This page lists the selected app's transaction Requests, the top five transactions by percent of wall-clock time, and relevant throughputs (requests per minute or rpm). For non-web transactions (such as message processing, background tasks, and other processes and jobs that do not handle web requests), this page shows charts of CPU and memory usage. Types of transactions Tip To get a high-level overview of all your applications and services, use the New Relic Explorer. Depending on your selected application, the Transactions page may include a dropdown you can use to select from the types of transactions available. New Relic measures processing time by type of request (web transaction or non-web transaction). This may include: Web: App server requests Non-web: Other requests (operations, background tasks, etc.) The Transactions page also may include links to transaction traces and key transactions. The types of information available will depend on your selected app and the type of request (web or non-web). Wall-clock time Wall-clock time is the amount of time recorded by the clock. New Relic uses wall-clock time for all the transactions and then sums that value across all of the transactions. The host can execute requests in parallel, so you may see percentages over 100. For example, 100% would indicate that the execution time across all selected transactions is equal to the time expended when recording wall-clock time. View transactions To view information about your app's transaction requests: Do one of the following: Go to one.newrelic.com > APM > (select an app) > Monitor > Transactions. Go to one.newrelic.com > Explorer > (select an app) > Monitor > Transactions. If applicable: To change which available types of transactions appear, select the Type. Select the sort order, or keep the default. Select the type of view as a chart (default), histogram, or percentile, if available. To view additional details, use any of the transaction drill-down functions. To add a chart to a dashboard, mouse over the chart, then select the Add to a dashboard link that appears below it. If a chart's background is light red, this indicates a time period when an alert condition's Critical threshold has been violated. To view the incident details in New Relic Alerts, click the chart. For more information, see the documentation about navigating core UI components in New Relic One. Use drill-down functions Use any of New Relic's standard user interface functions to drill down into detailed information. The Transactions page has additional drill-down functions. Change the displayed transaction Type If the Type dropdown appears above list of transactions, you can select your choice of transaction type. The available types depend on what transactions your application uses. Select the type of performance measurement (Sort) The Sort dropdown above the transaction list allows you to review transactions according to different measurements. This helps you identify good candidates for performance tuning or fixing errors. You can sort by: Sort option Comments Most time consuming (default) Highest percentage of the app's total time used. This measures which transactions consumed the most time in total. This is calculated by multiplying the number of times the transaction is called by the time the transaction took to complete. A transaction could be short, but if it is frequently called, it would appear at the top of this ranking. Slowest average response time Slowest individual transactions for the time period as averaged. This measures the slowest types of transaction. A transaction could be called only a few times, but if it is one of the longest transactions to finish, it would appear at the top of this ranking. Apdex most dissatisfying Transactions with the highest percentages of user dissatisfaction levels for the response time of your web apps and services (Apdex). The dissatisfaction level is the difference between a perfect Apdex score (1.0) and your app's apdex_t (\"tolerating\") score, based on your Apdex settings. Transactions that have the highest (worst) percentages appear at the top of this ranking. Highest throughput This measures the amount of throughput, in operation requests per minute or rpm. (For web throughput, requests per minute is sometimes called pages per minute or ppm.) Transactions that have the highest number of requests per minute appear at the top of this ranking. Tip Depending on the transaction type you choose, different sort options may be available. Mouse over summary information about a transaction To quickly view key pieces of information about the transaction, mouse over its name on the list. Select detailed information about a transaction To view detailed information, select a transaction from the list, then select App performance or Historical performance. You can also view transaction traces. View transaction data in different visual formats The Transaction page's Top 5 transactions chart and a selected transaction's App performance window include options to view data as a: Chart Histogram Percentile In addition, from the Breakdown table for a selected transaction, you can select the link to show or hide all segments of the breakdown data. Show corresponding browser request data In order to view browser information, you must install the browser agent. Then, to view corresponding browser request data, use either of these options: Select the Browser drill-down link if available. Go to one.newrelic.com > Browser > (select an app) > Page views. Identify transaction segments with high call counts or time In a transaction's Breakdown table, the Avg calls (per txn) column may include colorized segment values. These indicate instrumented segments that have exceeded thresholds. Yellow: Segment time is more than 10% of total transaction time and call count is higher than 10. Red: Segment time is more than 10% of total transaction time and call count is higher than 20. Show all transactions To view all available transactions as a table, select the Show all transactions table link. From here, use any of the available options: To change the sort order, select any column header. To export the data to a file with comma-separated values, select Export as CSV. To return to the previous chart view, select Back to top transactions. CSV tables for ending now time periods are calculated at run time. They may show slightly higher values than what appears in the APM table. For each transaction, the Show all transactions table includes these measurements: Measurement Definition Apdex The average Apdex score for all transactions that occurred in the selected time range. Apdex scores marked with an * asterisk indicate the agent collected fewer than 100 samples for that transaction name. Data for these transactions may be less accurate than data for transactions with higher throughput. Count The total number of all transactions that occurred in the selected time range. Avg (ms) The average time taken by all transactions in the selected time range. SD (ms) The standard deviation of all timing measurements for all transactions in the selected time range. Min (ms) The time taken by the fastest transaction in the selected time range. Max (ms) The time taken by the slowest transaction in the selected time range. Total (ms) The total amount of time taken by all transactions that occurred in the selected time range. Total (% time) The total amount of time for all transactions of that type, expressed as a percentage of the total amount of time taken by all transactions. Dissat (%) The percentage of the transactions that did not have satisfied Apdex scores. If you view transactions as a table, the All transactions row always contributes 100% of the app's total dissatisfaction, even if no responses are dissatisfying (100% of zero is zero). In this situation, 100% does not mean that all of your transactions are dissatisfying. The sum of all the other values in the Dissat (%) column is 100%.

Slow queries metrics The slow queries list contains the following metrics: Metric Description Response time The average response time for the statements sampled. Sample count The number of slow queries identified in the sample. To view additional details, select an individual slow query: Metric Description Start time When the stack trace began collecting the data shown. Max time The maximum time for all similar query statements in the sample. Action The action or process invoking the query. Query The query that is being reported as slow. Depending on your configuration, some parts of the query may be obfuscated. Stack trace Where in the code the statement was called. For MySQL, we provide a query analysis, which explains what happened in your query and what you might do to speed it up. Other databases display an explain plan whenever possible. Troubleshooting: No slow query data If you do not see slow query data, it may be for any of these reasons: The slow query feature has been disabled. The threshold is set to too high a duration and no slow queries are being reported. The query obfuscation setting (usually record_sql or similar) may be set to Off. To solve the problem, try adjusting the configuration options.",

      "body": "The thread profiler is a low-impact profiling tool that can be used in production to identify bottlenecks in an application. It works by periodically (100ms) capturing the stack trace of each thread for a specified duration. At the end of the specified duration, the stack traces are aggregated to build a tree. The call count in the tree corresponds to the number of times that function was present in the stack traces under the same context. Although the call tree cannot capture the entire execution, a large enough sample can be a good representation of the application behavior. This provides insights into the \"hot\" functions of the app where most of the time is spent. With this scope, entries sampled less than 0.05% are omitted. Supported agents This feature is available only for specific agents and versions: Java: Agent versions 1.2.004.6 or higher .NET: Framework: Agent versions 2.12.146.0 or higher .NET Core 2.0: Agent versions 8.3.360.0 or higher (Windows only) Linux: .NET Core 3.0 or higher and agent versions 8.23 or higher Python: Agent versions 1.7.0 or higher Ruby: Agent versions 3.5.5 or higher Start the profiler The thread profiler feature is enabled by default. You also may be able to turn it on or off in your agent configuration file: Java: thread_profiler.enabled NET: You cannot disable the thread profiler with .NET apps. Python: thread_profiler.enabled Ruby: thread_profiler.enabled When enabled, you can view the thread profiler from our user interface: Go to one.newrelic.com > APM > (select an app) > Events > Thread profiler. Select the host you want to run the profiler on. Set the duration for the profiling session. Select Start profiler. This triggers the agent to start the thread profiler during the next harvest cycle (every one minute) and capture data for the specified duration. We record thread backtraces whether or not they are in a runnable state at the time the sample is taken. Threads that are sleeping or blocked on IO may appear in the call tree. one.newrelic.com > APM > (select an app) > Events > Thread profiler: Use this page to define the settings for the thread profiler duration and to view the results. View profile data After the profiler finishes running, the agent will report the profile data. The call tree automatically appears on the Thread profiler page. The percentages in the call tree represent the percentage of thread backtrace samples in which each call path appeared during the profiling session. The data collection started at the PROFILE COLLECTED time. The page color-codes the tree results: Red: Percentages greater than 30% Yellow: Percentages greater than 10% Black: Percentages less than 10% If you want to... Do this... Change how the thread profile information appears Select your choices of available options in the Tree settings, and select Refresh tree. Change how much information appears Select the Expand or Collapse options above the call tree, or select the name or arrow on any line in the call tree. View summary information about any line in the call tree Mouse over the line. Email the thread profile results to others Select Share this profile. Start another session or view a different thread profile Select Back to all profiles. Agent considerations Depending on which agent you use, the thread profiling feature has additional considerations. .NET-specific notes When using thread profiling with the .NET Framework agent, be aware of the following. .NET agent Thread profiler notes Supported on Linux Thread profiling on Linux is supported on .NET Core 3.0 or later applications when running .NET agent version 8.23 or later. Managed threads only For .NET agents, the thread profiler only captures stack traces on managed threads. It does not capture stack traces on unmanaged threads. If a call to an unmanaged function occurs on a managed thread, the thread profiler will show Native:Function Call in the call tree. No line numbers A .NET thread profile does not include line numbers in the call tree. The Show line numbers checkbox in the Tree Settings does not have any effect. Bug with 64-bit v4.0 .NET CLR There is a bug in the 64-bit version 4.0 .NET Common Language Runtime (CLR) that interferes with the agent's ability to retrieve managed stack traces. If your app experiences this bug, APM will show empty thread profiles. This bug does not affect 32-bit applications. The bug is fixed in the CLR releases for .NET 4.5. To verify whether your 64-bit application has the fixed version, look at the full version of the mscorlib.dll in the C: \\ Windows \\ Microsoft.NET \\ Framework64 \\ v4.0.30319 directory. The fix is in versions 4.0.30319.17379 or higher. Other category only All threads are put in the Other category. The Web Request and Background categories are not supported. Python-specific notes When using thread profiling with the Python agent, be aware of the following. Python agent Thread profiler notes Co-routine based systems There are limits to capturing details when a co-routine based system is being used, such as gevent or eventlet modes of gunicorn. If creating a new thread, the Python agent will actually create a greenlet instead of a thread profiler background thread. Therefore, the thread profiler will not capture any web request and background transactions on the thread profiler page. Greenlets A greenlet can run only when other greenlets explicitly yield control, such as when they block. For example, if the thread sampler does get to run, it will only sample the stack for other greenlets at a point where they are blocked. It will not sample them when they are executing arbitrary code. It can completely miss execution within a greenlet if it never blocked or otherwise yielded to another greenlet. Time in Python code Time spent in pure Python code that isn't blocking requests will not be picked up, and no information will be recorded or reported. This is because results are misleading when co-routines are used. Ruby-specific notes When using thread profiling with the Ruby agent, be aware of the following. Ruby agent Thread profiler notes Backtraces The thread profiler depends on the ability to capture thread backtraces from within your Ruby application. For this reason, it requires MRI 1.9.2 or higher (for the Thread#backtrace method). Resque The Ruby agent does not currently support thread profiles with Resque background jobs. A thread profiling session initiated against Resque will only capture traces from the parent process, not the job processes. JRuby JRuby support is considered experimental at this time. There are known issues with JRuby's Thread#backtrace implementation that will affect the accuracy of and reliability of backtraces collected under JRuby.",

      "body": "In order to report request queuing, New Relic agents depend on an HTTP header set by the front-end web server (such as Apache or Nginx) or load balancer (such as HAProxy or F5). These examples use the X-Request-Start header, since it is has broader support across platforms. If this does not work with your server configuration for request queuing, try using the X-Queue-Start header. The syntax should otherwise be the same. Apache Apache's mod_headers module includes a %t variable that is formatted correctly. To enable request queue reporting, add this code to your Apache config: RequestHeader set X-Request-Start \"%t\" Copy Nginx If you are using Nginx version 1.2.6 or higher and the latest version of the Ruby, Python, or PHP agent, Nginx can easily be configured to report queue time. (For Nginx versions 1.2.6 or lower, you must recompile Nginx with a module or patch.) Configuring with Nginx 1.2.6 or higher uses the ${msec} variable, which is a number in seconds with milliseconds resolution. For more information, see http://nginx.org/en/docs/http/ngx_http_core_module.html#variables. Add the appropriate information to your Nginx config: Nginx configuration Values General Nginx use proxy_set_header X-Request-Start \"t=${msec}\"; Copy Passenger Version 5 or higher: >passenger_set_header X-REQUEST-START \"t=${msec}\"; Copy Older versions: passenger_set_cgi_param X_REQUEST_START \"t=${msec}\"; Copy fastcgi fastcgi_param HTTP_X_REQUEST_START \"t=${msec}\"; Copy uWSGI uwsgi_param HTTP_X_REQUEST_START \"t=${msec}\"; Copy F5 load balancers For F5 load balancers, use this configuration snippet: when HTTP_REQUEST_SEND { # TCL 8.4 so we have to calculate the time in millisecond resolution # Calculation from: https://groups.google.com/forum/? fromgroups=#!topic/comp.lang.tcl/tV9H6TDv0t8 set secs [clock seconds] set ms [clock clicks -milliseconds] set base [expr { $secs * 1000 }] set fract [expr { $ms - $base }] if { $fract >= 1000 } { set diff [expr { $fract / 1000 }] incr secs $diff incr fract [expr { -1000 * $diff }] } set micros [format \"%d%03d000\" $secs $fract] # Want this header inserted as if coming from the client clientside { HTTP::header insert X-Request-Start \"t=${micros}\" } } Copy Network timing Even with request queuing configured, the front-end server's setup can still affect network time in your browser data. This is because the front-end server does not add the queuing time header until after it actually accepts and processes the request. The queuing time headers can never account for backlog in the listener socket used to accept requests. For example, if the front-end server's configuration results in a backlog of requests that queue in the listener socket, page load timing will show an increase in network time.",

      "body": "Request queuing occurs before the request reaches your application (where the agent resides). This is why you need to do some straightforward configuration of the agent and your production hosts to take advantage of this feature. HTTP header In order to report request queuing, most New Relic agents depend on an HTTP header set by the front-end web server (such as Apache or Nginx) or load balancer (such as HAProxy or F5). You can configure these front-end servers to set the timestamp in the HTTP header that represents when the request first entered your production infrastructure. Tip Set this header as soon after the request enters your infrastructure as possible so that you are less likely to miss performance problems in your infrastructure that occur before the header is set. Most New Relic agents will interpret an X-Queue-Start or X-Request-Start header and use it to calculate Request Queuing. The agents treat these headers identically. Include a value in the format t=MICROSECONDS_SINCE_EPOCH where MICROSECONDS_SINCE_EPOCH is an integer value of the number of microseconds that have elapsed since the beginning of the Unix epoch (for example, January 1, 1970). Nearly any front-end HTTP server or load balancer can be configured to add this header. Additional details depend on your specific agent and server configuration. For more information, see the request queue configuration examples. C SDK The C SDK does not support request queuing. Go agent With the Go agent, set either header to record a metric for it. Java, Node.js, Python, Ruby agents The most recent versions of the Java, Node.js, Python, and Ruby agents provide more flexibility in the format of the X-Request-Start or X-Queue-Start header. These agents allow the timestamp to be submitted in seconds, milliseconds, or microseconds as an integer or floating point value. These agents also allow the leading t= in the header value to be omitted. Based on the order of magnitude, these agents automatically interpret the time unit as seconds, milliseconds, or microseconds. New Relic can do this reliably since a millisecond timestamp, interpreted as microseconds, would result in a queue time over 40 years. Python agent only: When using Apache/mod_wsgi 3.4 or higher, mod_wsgi will automatically insert an equivalent to the X-Queue-Start header into the WSGI environ dictionary for each request. This will mark the specific point in time where Apache first accepted the request. The value set by mod_wsgi will be picked up and used by the Python agent if no separate X-Request-Start or X-Queue-Start header has been manually configured into a web server's front end or in Apache itself. .NET agent The .NET agent does not require (and will ignore) any configuration of HTTP headers to calculate queue time. It works by instrumenting the IIS-queuing mechanism directly and reports queue time as the difference between when the HttpContext constructor executes and when the HttpApplication.BeginRequest event fires. Request queue time is only reported for .NET Framework applications hosted on IIS (for example: ASP.NET applications). It is not reported for ASP .NET Core applications (targeting .NET Core or Framework), nor for self-hosted OWIN applications. PHP agent The PHP agent only supports the X-Request-Start header. This identifies the timestamp in microseconds as an integer, with an optional t= in the header value. To ensure that the header is read properly, check your phpinfo() under the PHP Variables section, and verify that _SERVER[\"HTTP_X_REQUEST_START\"] exists and is in the expected format. If you are using Nginx, see Request queue server configuration examples for additional information on setting the header.",

For rules regarding specific data formats, see: New Relic-format trace data Zipkin-format trace data Endpoints All trace data is sent via HTTPS POST to a Trace API endpoint. We have a few endpoints, depending on your setup: Default Trace API endpoint: https://trace-api.newrelic.com/trace/v1 EU data centers: https://trace-api.eu.newrelic.com/trace/v1 (see other EU endpoints). Infinite Tracing: when you complete the Trace observer setup, you get a custom YOUR_TRACE_OBSERVER_URL value to use as an endpoint. If you're using an integration that uses the Trace API (for example, these integrations), you must configure that integration with that endpoint. You will also want to adjust the sampling of your tracing service to send us 100% of spans. For FedRAMP, see FedRAMP endpoints. Data formats Currently, the Trace API accepts two types of data formats: zipkin: For reporting Zipkin trace data. Zipkin data must be Zipkin JSON v2. newrelic: For reporting all other trace data. Restricted attributes The attributes in the table below are restricted in the newrelic-format JSON (in the attributes block) and in the zipkin-format JSON (in the tags block). Any values with these keys will be omitted: Restricted attribute Description entityGuid string Unique identifier for the entity that created this span. Generated from service.name, if available. guid string Used for backwards compatibility with data from APM agents. The attributes in the table below are used internally to identify entities. Any values submitted with these keys in the attributes section of a metric data point may cause undefined behavior such as missing entities in the UI or telemetry not associating with the expected entities. For more information please refer to Entity synthesis: Restricted attribute description entity.guid string Unique identifier for the entity associated with this span. entity.name string Human-readable name of an entity, often used to identify an entity in the UI. entity.type string Used to differentiate between different types of entities, like hosts, applications, etc. Request metadata (headers and query parameters) The following table shows the required request metadata for all trace data formats. This metadata can be sent as HTTP headers on an ingest request or, in some cases, provided as query parameters, which may be required for tracing frameworks that don't allow header modification. Important Security note: We suggest using headers because query parameters are present in the URL and may be logged before being encrypted and received by New Relic. All data sent as query parameters must be URL-safe. Header Query param? Details Content-Type No Required. Must be application/json. Content-Length No Required. The length of the request body in octets (8-bit bytes) unless sent with chunked encoding. This header is generally set by default by the underlying HTTP client sending the data and in most cases should not require any additional effort by the end user. Api-Key Yes (case-sensitive) Required. The Trace API requires a license key. If this is provided as both a header and a query parameter, the values must match. Content-Encoding No Required if compressed payload. The value must be gzip. Data-Format Yes Required for zipkin. Optional for newrelic. If present, Data-Format-Version must also be present. Data-Format-Version Yes Required for zipkin. If present, Data-Format must also be present. There are only two possible pairings for these values: If Data-Format is zipkin, Data-Format-Version must be 2. If Data-Format is newrelic, Data-Format-Version must be 1. x-request-id No Optional - Reserved for future use. The value must be a valid UUID4. The value is expected to be unique for each request. Response validation A response for successfully sending trace data will include a requestId. For example: {\"requestId\":\"c1bb62fc-001a-b000-0000-016bb152e1bb\"} Copy There are two ways success/errors are signaled: HTTP status code (synchronous). Authentication and request errors will be signaled via HTTP status code. See HTTP status codes Code Meaning 202 Data accepted. This means that you've passed preliminary checks, but is not a guarantee that the data has been successfully parsed and indexed as part of a distributed trace. 400 The structure of the request was invalid. Errors with query parameters, etc. 403 Authentication error. May occur with an invalid license key or if you lack necessary entitlement to use the Trace API. 404 The request path is incorrect. 405 For any request method other than POST. 408 The request took too long to reach the endpoint. 411 The Content-Length header wasn’t included. 413 The payload was too big. 414 The request URI was too long. 415 The Content-Type or Content-Encoding was invalid. 429 The request rate quota has been exceeded. 431 The request headers are too long. 5xx There was a server error (please retry). NrIntegrationError events (asynchronous). Errors with the JSON payload or other semantic errors are asynchronously signaled via NrIntegrationError events that are stored in the account whose license key is associated with the request. For all errors of this type, the attribute newRelicFeature will be Distributed Tracing and requestId will be the requestId from the endpoint response. If you receive a 202 response and don't see an NrIntegrationError event, your data should be visible in New Relic One's global distributed tracing UI in about a minute. You should be able to find the trace using a standard trace search like: traceId = TRACE_ID_SENT Copy Data limits Distributed tracing rate limits are set per account and data type. For details about data limits, see New Relic data usage limits and policies. When you exceed your span rate limit, an NrIntegrationError event is generated. You can query rate limit messages with this NRQL: SELECT * FROM NrIntegrationError WHERE newRelicFeature = 'Distributed Tracing' AND category = 'RateLimit' AND rateLimitType = 'SpansPerMinute' Copy To get a notification when you exceed the limit, you can set up a NRQL alert. We calculate a rolling 10-minute average based on your span rate limit. This allows for temporary rate bursts, and lets us prioritize keeping and dropping complete traces instead of indiscriminately dropping spans on a per minute limit basis. In the example below of exceeding the rate, the rate limit is the default 100,000 spans per minute. New Relic allows a burst above 100K for a couple of minutes without downsampling, because the remaining minutes in the 10-minute window averaged under 100K spans/minute. For the previous 10 minutes (8:50 - 9:00) the service received 60,000 spans/minute. Minute Spans sent to API Total for past 10 minutes 8:59 60,000 600,000 9:00 40,000 580,000 9:01 50,000 570,000 9:02 250,000 760,000 9:03 220,000 920,000 9:04 125,000 985,000 9:05 70,000 995,000 9:06 50,000 985,000 9:07 40,000 965,000 9:08 40,000 945,000 9:09 40,000 925,000",

Note: if you have a EU New Relic account, use the EU endpoint instead. curl -i -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \\ -H 'Api-Key: $YOUR_LICENSE_KEY' \\ -H 'Data-Format: newrelic' \\ -H 'Data-Format-Version: 1' \\ -X POST \\ -d '[ { \"common\": { \"attributes\": { \"service.name\": \"Test Service A\", \"host\": \"host123.example.com\" } }, \"spans\": [ { \"trace.id\": \"123456\", \"id\": \"ABC\", \"attributes\": { \"duration.ms\": 12.53, \"name\": \"/home\" } }, { \"trace.id\": \"123456\", \"id\": \"DEF\", \"attributes\": { \"error.message\": \"Invalid credentials\", \"service.name\": \"Test Service A\", \"host\": \"host456.example.com\", \"duration.ms\": 2.97, \"name\": \"/auth\", \"parent.id\": \"ABC\" } } ] } ]' 'https://trace-api.newrelic.com/trace/v1' Copy Tip If you're sending more than one POST, change the trace.id to a unique value. Sending the same payload or span id multiple times for the same trace.id may result in fragmented traces in the UI. If your test returned HTTP/1.1 202 Accepted, go to our UI to see a query of your test data using the span attribute service.name = Test Service A. Tip Traces may take up to one minute to be processed by both the trace observer and the Trace API. Trace API payload (New Relic format) The Trace API JSON payload is an array of objects, with each object representing a single trace. Each of these objects requires a spans key and may also include a common key. spans (required) contains an array of objects, with each object representing a span. common (optional) shares information across multiple spans. The Span object in the spans array field type description required default id string Unique identifier for this span. yes N/A trace.id string Unique identifier shared by all spans within a single trace. yes N/A timestamp long Span start time in milliseconds since the Unix epoch. no Current time in UTC timezone attributes object Any set of key: value pairs that add more details about a span. duration.ms, name, and parent.id are strongly recommended to add. no N/A Requests without the required keys above will be rejected, and an NrIntegrationError will be generated. The common object (optional) field type description required default attributes object Any set of key: value pairs that add common details about spans in the payload. If a span contains an attribute that has been set in common, the key in the span attributes object will take precedence. duration.ms, name, and parent.id are strongly recommended to add. no N/A Highly recommended attributes While not required, these attributes should be included for the best experience with your data in the attributes object for each span. attribute default description duration.ms float none Duration of this span in milliseconds. name string none The name of this span. parent.id string none The id of the caller of this span. Value is null if this is the root span. Traces without a root span will not be displayed. service.name string none The name of the entity that created this span. Reserved attributes These attributes are currently reserved for internal New Relic usage. While they are not explicitly blocked, we recommend not using them. attribute default description entity.name string service.name This is derived from the service.name attribute. entity.type string service The entity type is assumed to be a service. entity.guid string None The entity.guid is a derived value that uniquely identifies the entity in New Relic's backend. Other attributes You can add any arbitrary attributes you want in the attributes object in either common or each span object, with the exception of the restricted attributes. For example, you might want to add attributes like customer.id or user.id to help you analyze your trace data. Requirements and guidelines for trace JSON using the newrelic format: Each JSON payload is an array of objects. Each object should contain a required spans key. Each object can contain an optional common key. Use this if you want to share information across multiple spans in a object. Any keys on a span have precedence over the same key in the common block. The value for a spans key is a list of span objects. Certain attributes are required, and must be included either in the optional common block, or in each span. Recommended and custom attributes can be optionally included in a list of key-value pairs under a key named attributes, in the optional common block and/or in each span. In the following example POST, there are two spans, both of which have the trace.id 12345 and the custom attribute host: host123.example.com. The first span has no parent.id, so that is the root of the trace; the second span's parent.id points to the ID of the first. [ { \"common\": { \"attributes\": { \"host\": \"host123.example.com\" } }, \"spans\": [ { \"trace.id\": \"12345\", \"id\": \"abc\", \"timestamp\": 1603336834823, \"attributes\": { \"user.email\": \"bob@newr.com\", \"service.name\": \"my-service\", \"duration.ms\": 750, \"name\": \"my-span\" } }, { \"trace.id\": \"12345\", \"id\": \"def\", \"timestamp\": 1603336834899, \"attributes\": { \"parent.id\": \"abc\", \"service.name\": \"second-service\", \"duration.ms\": 750, \"name\": \"second-span\" } } ] } ] Copy To learn how to control how spans appear in New Relic (for example, adding errors or setting a span as a datastore span), see Decorate spans.

      "body": "If you want to create your own tracing implementation, you can use our Trace API. This doc explains how to send Zipkin-format trace data to our Trace API. (For our general data format, see New Relic format.) Zipkin version requirements The Trace API supports data from Zipkin JSON v2 (or higher) without any modification. For details on this version, see Zipkin v2 release details and the Zipkin v2 schema. Overview of using the Trace API Using our Trace API is as simple as: Sending trace data in the expected format (in this case, zipkin format). Sending that data to the appropriate endpoint Our send-data instructions have options for enabling Infinite Tracing. To learn more about this, see Intro to Infinite Tracing and Sampling considerations. To get started using the Trace API, choose an option: Send a sample trace: This shows a curl example of sending a trace to New Relic. This is useful for understanding how the Trace API works, and to verify you're seeing data in New Relic. Report data from existing Zipkin instrumentation: if you have an existing Zipkin implementation, you can simply change the endpoint of where your data gets sent. Send sample Zipkin trace payload This section describes how to send a simple Zipkin-format trace to our Trace API via curl request. You might choose to do this in order to learn how our API works and to verify that data is showing up in New Relic before doing in-depth instrumentation. To get started sending a sample payload: (Optional, to enable Infinite Tracing) First, you must set up a trace observer. That procedure includes instructions for sending a sample trace using our general new-relic format. When you get to that step, return here to instead learn how to send a Zipkin-format trace. Send a Zipkin-format payload following the instructions below. Send Zipkin-format payload To send a sample Zipkin-format trace: Get the license key for the account you want to report data to. You'll be executing a curl request, below. Notes on this: Replace the license key placeholder with your license key. If you're using Infinite Tracing, use the YOUR_TRACE_OBSERVER_URL value in place of the standard endpoint. If you want to send more than one post, change the trace ID to a different value. Sending the same payload or span id multiple times for the same traceId may result in fragmented traces in the UI. curl -i -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \\ -H 'Api-Key: $NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY' \\ -H 'Data-Format: zipkin' \\ -H 'Data-Format-Version: 2' \\ -X POST \\ -d '[ { \"traceId\": \"test-zipkin-trace-id-1\", \"id\": \"3e0f5885710776cd\", \"kind\": \"CLIENT\", \"name\": \"post\", \"duration\": 508068, \"localEndpoint\": { \"serviceName\": \"service-1\", \"ipv4\": \"127.0.0.1\", \"port\": 8080 }, \"tags\": { } }, { \"traceId\": \"test-zipkin-trace-id-1\", \"parentId\": \"3e0f5885710776cd\", \"id\": \"asdf9asdn123lkasdf\", \"kind\": \"CLIENT\", \"name\": \"service 2 span\", \"duration\": 2019, \"localEndpoint\": { \"serviceName\": \"service-2\", \"ipv4\": \"127.0.0.1\", \"port\": 8080 }, \"tags\": { \"error.message\": \"Invalid credentials\" } } ]' 'https://trace-api.newrelic.com/trace/v1' Copy Within a minute, the trace should be available in the our distributed tracing UI. To find it, run a query for the trace.id. In this example, it was test-zipkin-trace-id-1. Note that you search by the transformed attribute of trace.id (not traceId). To learn more: Learn where Trace API data shows up in the UI. Send data from an existing Zipkin instrumentation. Learn how to decorate spans by adding tags. This helps you customize how traces are displayed in our UI for a richer, more helpful experience. Learn about general endpoint information (data limits, required metadata, and response validation). Learn about how Zipkin data is transformed and stored in our format. If you don't see your trace data, see Troubleshooting. Send data from existing Zipkin instrumentation Preliminary notes: If you want to enable Infinite Tracing, you first must set up a trace observer. It can be helpful to first send a sample payload to verify things are working properly. To report data from an existing Zipkin instrumentation, you'll point the Zipkin tracer at the appropriate Trace API endpoint with some required request metadata. You can send the required metadata as headers or query parameters (some Zipkin tracer versions don't allow specifying HTTP headers). Here's an example of what it might look like to create a Zipkin OkHttpSender in Java configured for the Trace API: OkHttpSender.create(\"https://trace-api.newrelic.com/trace/v1?Api-Key=NEW_RELIC_INSERT_API_KEY&Data-Format=zipkin&Data-Format-Version=2\"); Copy Note that if you were using Infinite Tracing, or had an EU-region New Relic account, the endpoint would be different. For an explanation of Api-Key and the other metadata, see Request metadata. Transformation of Zipkin data To create a consistent search/query experience, some Zipkin data will be transformed to match New Relic attribute naming. For more on how we store and structure trace data, see How distributed tracing works. Zipkin tag Stored in New Relic as... Details traceId trace.id Unique identifier for a trace. id id Unique identifier for a span. parentId parent.id Identifier of the upstream span that called the service. kind kind Either Client or Server. name name Name of span. duration duration.ms Zipkin v2 spans must have durations specified in microseconds, and will be converted to milliseconds. localEndpoint: serviceName service.name We use the Zipkin v2 service name to identify the entity that created this span. localEndpoint: port localEndpoint.port All values in the localEndpoint object will be flattened to a span attribute called localEndpoint.key tags reported as attributes Key:value pairs in the tags object in Zipkin v2 will be written as span attributes. annotations not supported We do not currently support annotations in the Trace API. Spans will not be rejected if they contain annotations, but the annotations data will not be written. Add other tags/attributes You can add any tags you want to the tags block, with the exception of the restricted tags. For example, you might want to add attributes like customer.id or user.id to help you analyze your trace data. Tags will be converted to New Relic attributes.

For example, to view the index of APM apps, go to one.newrelic.com, then click APM. The Applications index lists all APM product entities and their current health status. Color Health status Green The entity is operational. We are collecting data that you can view in the appropriate UI. No alert violations are currently reported for it. Yellow The entity is degraded. A warning threshold has been violated. Red A critical threshold has been violated: Notifications have been sent based on the selected incident rollup preference. The incident appears in the Incidents index. Gray The entity's status is unknown. We're not receiving alerts data for the entity. This could mean alerts are muted, not set up, or the reporting system is down. Health status transitions The following table describes the different health status transitions an entity can endure: From... To... Transition explanation Gray Green The entity is evaluated for at least one condition, and the results show there are no violations present. Green / Red Gray Possible explanations: The last condition associated to the entity has been deleted and therefore there's no status to report. The last condition associated to the entity has been disabled and therefore there's no status to report. The entity has stopped reporting data. There's a New Relic platform issue. Check the New Relic status page for updates. Green Yellow / Red There's at least one open violation at the time the entity is undergoing the evaluation. Yellow / Red Green The last open violation associated to the entity has been closed. Example: App without conditions Here's an example of an app listed on the APM index that is not associated with any conditions. Its color-coded health status is light grey, which indicates no alert conditions are set up for that entity. Go to one.newrelic.com, then click Explorer: This example shows an app that currently isn't associated with any alerts conditions. Its grey status icon means it doesn't have any conditions. Follow standard procedures to add it to an existing condition or to create a new condition for it. Example: App with conditions Here's an example of an app listed on the APM index that is associated with one or more conditions. Its color-coded health status is green, because we are collecting data for it, and currently there are no Warning (yellow) or Critical (red) violations. Go to one.newrelic.com, then click Explorer: This example shows an app that has one or more conditions. Its color-coded health status (green) shows the app hasn't reached any threshold violations.

      "body": "The thread profiler is a low-impact profiling tool that can be used in production to identify bottlenecks in an application. It works by periodically (100ms) capturing the stack trace of each thread for a specified duration. At the end of the specified duration, the stack traces are aggregated to build a tree. The call count in the tree corresponds to the number of times that function was present in the stack traces under the same context. Although the call tree cannot capture the entire execution, a large enough sample can be a good representation of the application behavior. This provides insights into the \"hot\" functions of the app where most of the time is spent. With this scope, entries sampled less than 0.05% are omitted. Supported agents This feature is available only for specific agents and versions: Java: Agent versions 1.2.004.6 or higher .NET: Framework: Agent versions 2.12.146.0 or higher .NET Core 2.0: Agent versions 8.3.360.0 or higher (Windows only) Linux: .NET Core 3.0 or higher and agent versions 8.23 or higher Python: Agent versions 1.7.0 or higher Ruby: Agent versions 3.5.5 or higher Start the profiler The thread profiler feature is enabled by default. You also may be able to turn it on or off in your agent configuration file: Java: thread_profiler.enabled NET: You cannot disable the thread profiler with .NET apps. Python: thread_profiler.enabled Ruby: thread_profiler.enabled When enabled, you can view the thread profiler from our user interface: Go to one.newrelic.com > APM > (select an app) > Events > Thread profiler. Select the host you want to run the profiler on. Set the duration for the profiling session. Select Start profiler. This triggers the agent to start the thread profiler during the next harvest cycle (every one minute) and capture data for the specified duration. We record thread backtraces whether or not they are in a runnable state at the time the sample is taken. Threads that are sleeping or blocked on IO may appear in the call tree. one.newrelic.com > APM > (select an app) > Events > Thread profiler: Use this page to define the settings for the thread profiler duration and to view the results. View profile data After the profiler finishes running, the agent will report the profile data. The call tree automatically appears on the Thread profiler page. The percentages in the call tree represent the percentage of thread backtrace samples in which each call path appeared during the profiling session. The data collection started at the PROFILE COLLECTED time. The page color-codes the tree results: Red: Percentages greater than 30% Yellow: Percentages greater than 10% Black: Percentages less than 10% If you want to... Do this...

View summary information about any line in the call tree Mouse over the line. Email the thread profile results to others Select Share this profile. Start another session or view a different thread profile Select Back to all profiles. Agent considerations Depending on which agent you use, the thread profiling feature has additional considerations. .NET-specific notes When using thread profiling with the .NET Framework agent, be aware of the following. .NET agent Thread profiler notes Supported on Linux Thread profiling on Linux is supported on .NET Core 3.0 or later applications when running .NET agent version 8.23 or later. Managed threads only For .NET agents, the thread profiler only captures stack traces on managed threads. It does not capture stack traces on unmanaged threads. If a call to an unmanaged function occurs on a managed thread, the thread profiler will show Native:Function Call in the call tree. No line numbers A .NET thread profile does not include line numbers in the call tree. The Show line numbers checkbox in the Tree Settings does not have any effect. Bug with 64-bit v4.0 .NET CLR There is a bug in the 64-bit version 4.0 .NET Common Language Runtime (CLR) that interferes with the agent's ability to retrieve managed stack traces. If your app experiences this bug, APM will show empty thread profiles. This bug does not affect 32-bit applications. The bug is fixed in the CLR releases for .NET 4.5. To verify whether your 64-bit application has the fixed version, look at the full version of the mscorlib.dll in the C: \\ Windows \\ Microsoft.NET \\ Framework64 \\ v4.0.30319 directory. The fix is in versions 4.0.30319.17379 or higher. Other category only All threads are put in the Other category. The Web Request and Background categories are not supported. Python-specific notes When using thread profiling with the Python agent, be aware of the following. Python agent Thread profiler notes Co-routine based systems There are limits to capturing details when a co-routine based system is being used, such as gevent or eventlet modes of gunicorn. If creating a new thread, the Python agent will actually create a greenlet instead of a thread profiler background thread. Therefore, the thread profiler will not capture any web request and background transactions on the thread profiler page. Greenlets A greenlet can run only when other greenlets explicitly yield control, such as when they block. For example, if the thread sampler does get to run, it will only sample the stack for other greenlets at a point where they are blocked. It will not sample them when they are executing arbitrary code. It can completely miss execution within a greenlet if it never blocked or otherwise yielded to another greenlet. Time in Python code Time spent in pure Python code that isn't blocking requests will not be picked up, and no information will be recorded or reported. This is because results are misleading when co-routines are used. Ruby-specific notes When using thread profiling with the Ruby agent, be aware of the following. Ruby agent Thread profiler notes Backtraces The thread profiler depends on the ability to capture thread backtraces from within your Ruby application. For this reason, it requires MRI 1.9.2 or higher (for the Thread#backtrace method). Resque The Ruby agent does not currently support thread profiles with Resque background jobs. A thread profiling session initiated against Resque will only capture traces from the parent process, not the job processes. JRuby JRuby support is considered experimental at this time. There are known issues with JRuby's Thread#backtrace implementation that will affect the accuracy of and reliability of backtraces collected under JRuby.",

      "body": "The REST API endpoints allow you to create conditions for your policies. This glossary contains the names and descriptions of each of the fields that you can use to define or update a condition. Required and optional fields The API includes four types of New Relic Alerts conditions: APM External services NRQL Synthetic monitoring All of the fields used with a specific condition type are required except for these optional fields: enabled (defaults to false) runbook_url user_defined Field definitions Not every field listed in this glossary is required for every condition type. The condition type for which a field must be used is listed in each description. condition_scope This field allows you to scope a condition to either a JVM instance or to a whole application. This may be one of the strings: instance application Used for: Conditions Entity conditions For instance-based and JVM health metrics, see also violation_close_timer. enabled This is the status of your alert condition and is optional. The default is false. This field may be used to enable or disable a condition for maintenance or testing periods. Used for: Conditions External service conditions NRQL conditions Synthetic monitoring conditions entities This is an array of entity IDs identifying the objects that will be monitored with your condition. These may be application IDs, browser IDs, plugin IDs, key transaction IDs, external service IDs, etc. These are entered as a series of comma-separated integers if there is more than one. Used for: Conditions External service conditions expected_groups This is the number of groups you expect to see at any given time. It is used in combination with the ignore_overlap option. Used for: NRQL outlier conditions expiration[expiration_duration] How long to wait, in seconds, after the last data point is received by our platform before considering the signal as lost. This is based on the time when data arrives and not on data timestamps. The default is null. Add a value to enable loss of signal detection. Used for: NRQL conditions expiration[close_violations_on_expiration] When true, this closes all currently open violations when no signal is heard within the expiration_duration time. The default is false. Used for: NRQL conditions expiration[open_violation_on_expiration] When true, this opens a loss of signal violation when no signal within the expiration_duration time. The default is false. Used for: NRQL conditions external_service_url This is the URL of the external service to be monitored. This string must not include the protocol. For example, use example.com, not https://example.com. Used for: External service conditions ignore_overlap If disabled, this looks for a convergence (or overlapping) of groups. If the condition is looking for two or more groups, and the returned values can't be separated into that number of distinct groups, then that will also produce a violation. This type of overlap event is represented on a chart by group bands touching. Used for: NRQL outlier conditions metric The metric field is used for three alert categories. The exact parameters available for use depend on the setting in the type field. These are listed below according to their alert type field. Alerts conditions The value specified in the type field controls which of the parameters may be specified. The type field and corresponding available parameter names are listed in the following table. Only one may be specified. type Parameter apm_app_metric apdex error_percentage response_time_web response_time_background throughput_web throughput_background user_defined apm_kt_metric apdex error_percentage error_count response_time throughput browser_metric end_user_apdex total_page_load page_rendering web_application network dom_processing request_queuing ajax_response_time page_views_with_js_errors page_view_throughput ajax_throughput user_defined browser_metric_baseline page_view_throughput average_response_time ajax_response_time ajax_application_time mobile_metric database images json, network view_loading network_error_percentage status_error_percentage user_defined Alerts external service conditions The value specified in the type field controls which of the parameters may be specified. The type field and corresponding available parameter names are listed in the following table. Only one may be specified. type Parameter apm_external_service apdex error_percentage response_time_web response_time_background throughput_web throughput_background user_defined apm_app_metric_baseline external_service_transaction_time error_count database_transaction_time throughput_web response_time_web non_web_transaction_time web_transaction_database_time non_web_transaction_database_time mobile_external_service response_time_average response_time_minimum response_time_maximum throughput network_failure_percentage http_status_error_percentage monitor_id This is the GUID of the Synthetic monitoring to alert on. Used for: Synthetic monitoring conditions name This condition title will allow to you identify it in the UI. Follow the guidelines for making this descriptive but short. Used for: Conditions External service conditions NRQL conditions Synthetic monitoring conditions nrql[query] This is the NRQL query that alerts monitors as part of a NRQL condition. Used for: NRQL conditions nrql[since_value] Deprecated in favor of an aggregation_method with either an aggregation_delay or aggregation_timer. This is the timeframe (in minutes) in which to evaluate the specified NRQL query. since_value must be between 1 and 20. Used for: NRQL conditions runbook_url The runbook URL to display in notifications. This field is optional. Used for: Conditions External service conditions NRQL conditions Synthetic monitoring conditions signal[aggregation_delay] The length of time in seconds to wait for the aggregation window to fill with data. Required when using CADENCE or EVENT_FLOW aggregation_method types. Default is 120 seconds. Used with event flow and cadence aggregation methods. Used for: NRQL conditions signal[aggregation_method] New Relic aggregates data into windows, and needs to determine when the current window ends and the next one begins. The aggregation_method is the logic that tells us when we have all the data for a given aggregation window. Once the window is closed, the data is aggregated into a single point and evaluated against the threshold. This field is optional. One of the following three values can be specified: EVENT_FLOW: (Default) Each aggregation window will wait until it starts to see timestamps arrive that are past its own delay setting. Once this occurs, the data is published. Relies on the timestamps of arriving data, so wall-clock time is no longer relevant. Works best for sources that come in frequently and with low event spread (high througput metrics). CADENCE: Classic New Relic logic where each evaluation window waits exactly as long as the aggregation_delay setting, using the wall-clock time as a timer. aggregation_delay is required when using this option. Data arriving too late will be dropped, which can cause false alerts. EVENT_TIMER: Each aggregation window has a timer on it, set to the aggregation_timer value. The timer starts running as soon as the first data point appears for that aggregation window (based on the data point’s timestamp). The aggregation_timer is reset for each new data point that arrives for that window. Once the aggregation_timer reaches 0, the aggregation window is published. Ideal for sparse and batched data, such as cloud integrations and infrequent error logs. The default is Event flow. Used for: NRQL conditions signal[aggregation_timer] The length of time in seconds to wait after each data point is received, to ensure the entire batch is processed. Required when using the EVENT_TIMER aggregation_method type. Default is 60 seconds. Used for: NRQL conditions signal[aggregation_window] Streaming alerts gather data together into specific amounts of time before running the function in the NRQL query. These windows of time are customizable. Data points are collected together based on their timestamps and reported as a batch. The customizable aggregation window provides greater flexibility and fewer false violations when alerting on irregular or less frequent data points. In the UI, under Advanced signal settings, this is the Aggregation window field. Default is 60 seconds. Maximum is 15 minutes. Used for: NRQL conditions signal[evaluation_offset] Deprecated in favor of an aggregation_method with either an aggregation_delay or aggregation_timer. The offset is how long we wait for late data before evaluating each aggregation window. Waiting longer gives a more accurate signal but increases latency. The default is 3 aggregation windows. Used for: NRQL conditions signal[fill_option] For sporadic data, you can avoid false alerts by filling the gaps (empty windows) with synthetic data. none: (Default) Use this if you don’t want to take any action on empty aggregation windows. On evaluation, an empty aggregation window will reset the threshold duration timer. For example, if a condition says that all aggregation windows must have data points above the threshold for 5 minutes, and 1 of the 5 aggregation windows is empty, then the condition won’t be in violation. static: Use this if you’d like to insert a custom static value into the empty aggregation windows before they’re evaluated. This option has an additional, required parameter of fillValue that specifies what static value should be used. This defaults to 0. last_value: Use this to insert the last seen value before evaluation occurs. We maintain the state of the last seen value for 2 hours. In the UI, under Advanced signal settings, this is the Fill data gaps with field. Used for: NRQL conditions signal[fill_value] This is the value used by the fill_option custom value. The default is 0. Used for: NRQL conditions terms[duration] This is the time (in minutes) for the condition to persist before triggering an event. It corresponds to the duration set when adding a threshold in the UI. Used for: Conditions NRQL conditions terms[operator] This determines what comparison will be used between the value_function and the terms [ threshold] value to trigger an event. It corresponds to the operation selected when adding a threshold in the UI. It must be one of the following strings: above below equal Used for: Conditions External service conditions NRQL conditions terms[priority] This corresponds to the severity level selected when setting the threshold values for the condition in the UI. This must be one of the following strings: critical warning Used for: Conditions External service conditions NRQL conditions terms[threshold] This is the threshold that the value_function must be compared to using the terms [ operator] for an event to be triggered. It corresponds to the numeric value specified in the UI when adding the threshold values. This is a numeric value and must be 0 (zero) or greater. Used for: Conditions External service conditions NRQL conditions terms[time_function] This corresponds to the settings made in the UI when adding the threshold values. The choices are: all (corresponding to for at least in the UI) any (corresponding to at least once in in the UI) Used for: Conditions External service conditions NRQL conditions type This defines the type of metric that will be used for the alert. Allowable content for the metric field depends on the type value chosen. There are two product categories : Alerts conditions For this category, type is set to one of the following strings indicating the type of alerts condition. type Use apm_app_metric APM application metric will trigger an alert. apm_app_metric_baseline APM application metric will trigger an alert (using a baseline threshold). apm_kt_metric APM key transaction metric will trigger an alert. browser_metric Browser metric will trigger an alert. browser_metric_baseline Browser metric will trigger an alert (using a baseline threshold). mobile_metric Mobile metric will trigger an alert. Used for: Conditions Alerts external service conditions For this category, type is set to one of the following strings indicating the type of external service condition. type Use apm_external_service APM external metric will trigger an alert. mobile_external_service Mobile external metric will trigger an alert. Used for: External service conditions user_defined[metric] (optional) This is the name of a user defined custom metric to be used to determine if an event should be triggered. The user_defined [ value_function] associated with the metric is compared with the terms [ threshold] value when evaluating if an incident should be triggered. The comparison is performed using the operator defined by terms [ operator]. Used for: Conditions External service conditions Synthetic monitoring conditions user_defined[value_function] (optional) This is the numeric value obtained from the custom metric specified by user_defined [ metric]. It is compared with the terms [ threshold] value when evaluating if an incident should be triggered. The comparison is performed using the operator defined by terms [ operator]. One of these value functions must be specified: average min max total sample_size Used for: Conditions value_function When used for a NRQL condition, the options are: single_value (condition is evaluated based on each query's returned value) sum (condition is evaluated based on the sum of each query's returned values over the specified duration) violation_time_limit_seconds Use to automatically close instance-based violations after the number of seconds specified. Default is 259,200 seconds (3 days). Maximum is 30 days. Used for: Location conditions NRQL conditions violation_close_timer Use to automatically close instance-based violations, including JVM health metric violations, after the number of hours specified. Must be one of these values: 1 2 4 8 12 24 Used for: apm_app_metric (with condition_scope set to instance) apm_jvm_metric",

      "body": "Apdex T is the central value for Apdex. Apdex T is the response time above which a transaction is considered \"tolerable.\" You can define Apdex T values for each application, with separate values for app server and end-user browser performance. You can also define individual Apdex T thresholds for key transactions. Important You can only change Apdex thresholds for apps that are actively reporting data. For example, if one of your apps is not reporting, you won't see its Apdex setting options. App server Apdex settings The default Apdex T threshold for an application server is 0.5 seconds. To change the default application server threshold for web transactions: Go to one.newrelic.com > (select an app) > Settings > Application > Application settings. From the Application server section, set the Apdex T value (in seconds) for this application. Select Save application settings. After you change Apdex settings, a black vertical bar appears in the main chart on the APM Summary page. End-user (Browser) Apdex settings The default Apdex T threshold for browser monitoring is 7.0 seconds. To change the default end user threshold for Apdex T: Go to one.newrelic.com > Browser > (select an app) > Settings > Application settings. From the Settings page, set the end user Apdex T value (in seconds). Select Save application settings. Key transaction Apdex settings You can set custom Apdex values for your key transactions. These values are independent of the APM and browser Apdex values for the key transaction's parent application. Key transactions will contribute to the overall Apdex score based on their own Apdex T values. The default values are inherited from the parent application. Apdex alerting You can also configure alert conditions for Apdex. When the Apdex score passes the threshold you define, New Relic sends an alert to the notification mechanism (channel). Tip For Apdex scores, set Warning (yellow) conditions higher than Critical (red) conditions for Apdex scores. This will help you monitor your customers' experience before the Apdex level falls below an unsatisfactory level.",

Outlier detection conditions Outlier detection attempts to find groupings in your data and then looks for values that are outliers from those groupings. Outlier detection is available only for NRQL alerts. Synthetic monitoring multi-location conditions With multi-location Synthetic monitoring conditions, you can set up a monitor to notify you when a specific number of locations are failing at the same time. Key transaction metrics conditions For APM, you can set up conditions for key transactions. Java instance conditions You can set thresholds that open a violation when they are breached by any of your Java app's instance metrics. By scoping thresholds to specific instances, you can more quickly identify where potential problems are originating. This is useful, for example, to detect anomalies that are occurring only in a subset of your app's instances. These sorts of anomalies are easy to miss for apps that aggregate metrics across a large number of instances. JVM health metric conditions (Java apps) For Java apps monitored by APM, you can set thresholds that open a violation when the heap size or number of threads for a single JVM is out of the expected operating range. We calculate alerting threshold violations individually for each of the app's selected instances. When creating your condition, select JVM health metric as the type of condition for your Java app's alert policy, then select any of the available thresholds: Deadlocked threads Heap memory usage CPU utilization time Garbage collection CPU time Violations will automatically close when the inverse of the threshold is met, but by using the UI you can also change the time when a violation force-closes for a JVM health metric. Default is 24 hours. Web transaction percentile conditions We include the option to define a percentile as the threshold for your condition when your web app's response time is above, below, or equal to this value. This is useful, for example, when Operations personnel want to alert on a percentile for an app server's overall web transaction response time rather than the average web response time. Tip If you want to set an arbitrary threshold in a condition for a non-web app transaction, use the NRQL queries feature. To define the percentile threshold: Select Web transactions percentiles as the type of condition for your APM app's condition, then select a single app. (To alert on more than one app, create an individual Web transactions percentiles condition for each.) To define the thresholds that open the violation, type the Percentile nth response time value, then select its frequency (above, below, or equal to this value). We store the transaction time in milliseconds, although the user interface shows the Critical and Warning values as seconds. If you want to define milliseconds, be sure to include the decimal point in your value. Dynamic targeting with labels for apps By applying labels to applications, you can automatically link these entities to your condition. This makes it easy to manage all the applications within a dynamic environment. We recommend using the agent configuration file to best maintain entity labels. A single label identifies all entities associated with that label (maximum 10,000 entities). Multiple labels only identify entities which share all the selected labels. Using dynamic targeting with your condition also requires that you set a violation close timer. To add, edit, or remove up to ten labels for a condition: Select APM > Application metric as the product type. When identifying entities, select the Labels tab. Search for a label by name, or select a label from the list of categories. You can also create conditions directly within the context of what you are monitoring with Infrastructure. Infrastructure conditions You can create conditions for your resources directly in Infrastructure. For example, if you want to be notified when we have stopped receiving data from an Infrastructure agent, use the host not reporting condition type. This allows you to dynamically alert on filtered groups of hosts and configure the time window from 5 to 60 minutes. Apdex and response time conditions You can open violations and send notifications for response times. However, Apdex scores are almost always more meaningful and provide a better reflection of application performance. For example, average response times can be skewed by outliers, while the Apdex score gives a more accurate assessment of acceptable response time rates that your users experience. Change a condition name If you want to change the default condition name, make it short and descriptive. Provide useful information for notification messages that have limited characters, such as email subject lines, online chat, etc. Use camel case or dotted decimal notation. Describe the essence of what is being violated. To change an existing condition's name: In the one.newrelic.com top nav, click Alerts & AI, click Alert policies, then (select a policy). Click a condition name to edit it, and then type a meaningful name for the condition. You can't edit the product and condition type associated with a condition. Instead, you must delete the condition and create a new one with a different product and condition type. Maintain policies and conditions After you save the condition, the currently selected policy lists all alert conditions that apply to it. From here you can: Repeat the steps to add more conditions to the policy. Continue the policy setup process by adding one or more notification channels to it. Change the condition's name, the entities it's scoped to, or the critical (red) and warning (yellow) thresholds. Copy the condition and add it other policies in the selected account. Rename the policy. Disable any conditions in the policy, or delete the policy or any of its conditions. You may also manage your policies via the policies NerdGraph API. View existing conditions The policies index lists them in alphabetical order. To view or search for existing conditions: In the one.newrelic.com top nav, click Alerts & AI, then click Alert policies. Use the search box, sort any column, or scroll the list, then select a policy's name to see its conditions. To view policy and condition information for a specific entity: From that entity's product UI, select Settings, then click Alert conditions.",

      "body": "Apdex is an industry standard to measure users' satisfaction with the response time of web applications and services. It's a simplified Service Level Agreement (SLA) solution that helps you see how satisfied users are with your app through metrics such as Apdex score and dissatisfaction percentage instead of easily skewed traditional metrics such as average response time. Apdex measurements Apdex is a measure of response time based against a set threshold. It measures the ratio of satisfactory response times to unsatisfactory response times. The response time is measured from an asset request to completed delivery back to the requestor. After you define a response time threshold T, all responses handled in T or less time satisfy the user. For example, if T is 1.2 seconds and a response completes in 0.5 seconds, then the user is satisfied. All responses greater than 1.2 seconds dissatisfy the user. Responses greater than 4.8 seconds frustrate the user. You can define multiple Apdex T values for each of these: Apdex measurements Comments APM apps APM monitors the performance of these apps. To define their Apdex settings, use the APM UI. You can find Apdex on the APM Summary page and the browser Summary page. Browser apps Browser monitors the end-user experience for these apps. To define end-user Apdex settings for these apps, use the browser UI. New Relic labels them as End user on the APM Overview page and the browser Overview page. Key transactions These are transactions important to your business that you choose to monitor. You can define Apdex settings for key transactions on the Key transactions page. Important The key transaction Apdex setting overrides the T value of that app. For details, see Key transaction Apdex. Apdex levels Apdex tracks three response counts: Satisfied: The response time is less than or equal to T. Tolerating: The response time is greater than T and less than or equal to 4T. In this example, 4 x 1.2 = 4.8 seconds is the maximum tolerable response time. Frustrated: The response time is greater than 4T or the request returns a server-side error. A high error rate can cause you to have a satisfying average response time, yet a poor Apdex score. Your configuration file's apdex_f value is four times your app server's Apdex T value. This threshold is useful, for example, with transaction traces. For more information, see the configuration file documentation for your New Relic agent. The time calculation will change based on your own app's T setting. In the following example, T = 1.2 seconds. Level Multiplier Time (T Example = 1.2) Satisfied T or less < = 1.2 seconds Tolerated > T, < = 4T Between 1.2 and 4.8 seconds Frustrated > 4T Greater than 4.8 seconds After you define your Apdex levels, use any of New Relic's resources to help identify and troubleshoot changes that indicate poor customer experiences with your app. Apdex score The Apdex score is a ratio value of the number of satisfied and tolerating requests to the total requests made. Each satisfied request counts as one request, while each tolerating request counts as half a satisfied request. An Apdex score varies from 0 to 1, with 0 as the worst possible score (100% of response times were Frustrated), and 1 as the best possible score (100% of response times were Satisfied). Example Apdex score: During a 2 minute period a host handles 200 requests. The Apdex threshold T = 0.5 seconds (500ms). This value is arbitrary and is selected by the user. 170 of the requests were handled within 500ms, so they are classified as Satisfied. 20 of the requests were handled between 500ms and 2 seconds (2000 ms), so they are classified as Tolerating. The remaining 10 were not handled properly or took longer than 2 seconds, so they are classified as Frustrated. The resulting Apdex score is 0.9: (170 + (20/2))/200 = 0.9. Important The formula used for calculating the Apdex score is designed for high-throughput apps. If your app's throughput is less than 100 RPM, not enough data is collected to determine a stable score. The instability may result in Apdex alert conditions behaving unexpectedly. Errors pages Any request that returns a server-side error such as 500: Application Error is a frustrating response, regardless of its return speed. You can use Apdex to visualize the impact of these errors, and then identify and resolve these errors with New Relic's built-in error analytics and error profile tools. Dissatisfaction percentage The dissatisfaction percentage is the percentage of the total dissatisfaction experienced by the app's users that is contributed by this transaction. Example Apdex dissatisfaction calculation: Frustrations(Transaction) + Tolerations(Transaction)/2 Frustrations(App) + Tolerations(App)/2 To visualize dissatisfaction percentage, you can sort your transactions by most dissatisfying. If a transaction is always frustratingly slow but rarely visited, it will not contribute much to the app's total dissatisfaction. Conversely, if a transaction is normally fast, but has high throughput, this may contribute a large proportion of the app's dissatisfaction simply because it contributes a large proportion of your app's traffic.",

      "body": "Apdex T is the central value for Apdex. Apdex T is the response time above which a transaction is considered \"tolerable.\" You can define Apdex T values for each application, with separate values for app server and end-user browser performance. You can also define individual Apdex T thresholds for key transactions. Important You can only change Apdex thresholds for apps that are actively reporting data. For example, if one of your apps is not reporting, you won't see its Apdex setting options. App server Apdex settings The default Apdex T threshold for an application server is 0.5 seconds. To change the default application server threshold for web transactions: Go to one.newrelic.com > (select an app) > Settings > Application > Application settings. From the Application server section, set the Apdex T value (in seconds) for this application. Select Save application settings. After you change Apdex settings, a black vertical bar appears in the main chart on the APM Summary page. End-user (Browser) Apdex settings The default Apdex T threshold for browser monitoring is 7.0 seconds. To change the default end user threshold for Apdex T: Go to one.newrelic.com > Browser > (select an app) > Settings > Application settings. From the Settings page, set the end user Apdex T value (in seconds). Select Save application settings. Key transaction Apdex settings You can set custom Apdex values for your key transactions. These values are independent of the APM and browser Apdex values for the key transaction's parent application. Key transactions will contribute to the overall Apdex score based on their own Apdex T values. The default values are inherited from the parent application. Apdex alerting You can also configure alert conditions for Apdex. When the Apdex score passes the threshold you define, New Relic sends an alert to the notification mechanism (channel). Tip For Apdex scores, set Warning (yellow) conditions higher than Critical (red) conditions for Apdex scores. This will help you monitor your customers' experience before the Apdex level falls below an unsatisfactory level.",

      "body": "Apdex is an industry standard to measure users' satisfaction with the response time of web applications and services. It's a simplified Service Level Agreement (SLA) solution that helps you see how satisfied users are with your app through metrics such as Apdex score and dissatisfaction percentage instead of easily skewed traditional metrics such as average response time. Apdex measurements Apdex is a measure of response time based against a set threshold. It measures the ratio of satisfactory response times to unsatisfactory response times. The response time is measured from an asset request to completed delivery back to the requestor. After you define a response time threshold T, all responses handled in T or less time satisfy the user. For example, if T is 1.2 seconds and a response completes in 0.5 seconds, then the user is satisfied. All responses greater than 1.2 seconds dissatisfy the user. Responses greater than 4.8 seconds frustrate the user. You can define multiple Apdex T values for each of these: Apdex measurements Comments APM apps APM monitors the performance of these apps. To define their Apdex settings, use the APM UI. You can find Apdex on the APM Summary page and the browser Summary page. Browser apps Browser monitors the end-user experience for these apps. To define end-user Apdex settings for these apps, use the browser UI. New Relic labels them as End user on the APM Overview page and the browser Overview page. Key transactions These are transactions important to your business that you choose to monitor. You can define Apdex settings for key transactions on the Key transactions page. Important The key transaction Apdex setting overrides the T value of that app. For details, see Key transaction Apdex. Apdex levels Apdex tracks three response counts: Satisfied: The response time is less than or equal to T. Tolerating: The response time is greater than T and less than or equal to 4T. In this example, 4 x 1.2 = 4.8 seconds is the maximum tolerable response time. Frustrated: The response time is greater than 4T or the request returns a server-side error. A high error rate can cause you to have a satisfying average response time, yet a poor Apdex score. Your configuration file's apdex_f value is four times your app server's Apdex T value. This threshold is useful, for example, with transaction traces. For more information, see the configuration file documentation for your New Relic agent. The time calculation will change based on your own app's T setting. In the following example, T = 1.2 seconds. Level Multiplier Time (T Example = 1.2) Satisfied T or less < = 1.2 seconds Tolerated > T, < = 4T Between 1.2 and 4.8 seconds Frustrated > 4T Greater than 4.8 seconds After you define your Apdex levels, use any of New Relic's resources to help identify and troubleshoot changes that indicate poor customer experiences with your app. Apdex score The Apdex score is a ratio value of the number of satisfied and tolerating requests to the total requests made. Each satisfied request counts as one request, while each tolerating request counts as half a satisfied request. An Apdex score varies from 0 to 1, with 0 as the worst possible score (100% of response times were Frustrated), and 1 as the best possible score (100% of response times were Satisfied). Example Apdex score: During a 2 minute period a host handles 200 requests. The Apdex threshold T = 0.5 seconds (500ms). This value is arbitrary and is selected by the user. 170 of the requests were handled within 500ms, so they are classified as Satisfied. 20 of the requests were handled between 500ms and 2 seconds (2000 ms), so they are classified as Tolerating. The remaining 10 were not handled properly or took longer than 2 seconds, so they are classified as Frustrated. The resulting Apdex score is 0.9: (170 + (20/2))/200 = 0.9. Important The formula used for calculating the Apdex score is designed for high-throughput apps. If your app's throughput is less than 100 RPM, not enough data is collected to determine a stable score. The instability may result in Apdex alert conditions behaving unexpectedly. Errors pages Any request that returns a server-side error such as 500: Application Error is a frustrating response, regardless of its return speed. You can use Apdex to visualize the impact of these errors, and then identify and resolve these errors with New Relic's built-in error analytics and error profile tools. Dissatisfaction percentage The dissatisfaction percentage is the percentage of the total dissatisfaction experienced by the app's users that is contributed by this transaction. Example Apdex dissatisfaction calculation: Frustrations(Transaction) + Tolerations(Transaction)/2 Frustrations(App) + Tolerations(App)/2 To visualize dissatisfaction percentage, you can sort your transactions by most dissatisfying. If a transaction is always frustratingly slow but rarely visited, it will not contribute much to the app's total dissatisfaction. Conversely, if a transaction is normally fast, but has high throughput, this may contribute a large proportion of the app's dissatisfaction simply because it contributes a large proportion of your app's traffic.",

      "body": "A condition describes a monitored data source and the behavior of that data source that will be considered a violation. This document will explain the types of conditions available, how to create a condition, and how to view existing conditions. Related documentation: Basic concepts and workflow Min/max limits (like maximum number of conditions per policy) REST API to list or edit alert settings NRQL Condition NerdGraph API to manage your NRQL conditions via NerdGraph. Create a condition To create a condition: Create a policy and you will automatically be prompted to add a condition. OR From an existing policy page, select Create/add a condition. Follow the prompts in the UI, which include: Selecting a product/data-source Selecting a condition type Defining thresholds Optional: After you finish creating a condition, copy it and add it to other policies. Important Conditions that provide fields for you to input numerical values accept decimal points up to the second decimal place (hundredths). For example, 0.01 is the smallest possible value. Types of conditions Here are descriptions of the different types of conditions: NRQL query conditions Use the UI or NerdGraph API to create NRQL conditions for basic NRQL queries that return a number. APM metric alert conditions See APM metric alert conditions for tips about creating APM conditions using NRQL. Baseline conditions Baseline alerting allows you to create conditions that dynamically adjust to changing data and trends, such as weekly or seasonal patterns. This feature is available for APM and browser monitoring apps, as well as NRQL queries. Outlier detection conditions Outlier detection attempts to find groupings in your data and then looks for values that are outliers from those groupings. Outlier detection is available only for NRQL alerts. Synthetic monitoring multi-location conditions With multi-location Synthetic monitoring conditions, you can set up a monitor to notify you when a specific number of locations are failing at the same time. Key transaction metrics conditions For APM, you can set up conditions for key transactions. Java instance conditions You can set thresholds that open a violation when they are breached by any of your Java app's instance metrics. By scoping thresholds to specific instances, you can more quickly identify where potential problems are originating. This is useful, for example, to detect anomalies that are occurring only in a subset of your app's instances. These sorts of anomalies are easy to miss for apps that aggregate metrics across a large number of instances. JVM health metric conditions (Java apps) For Java apps monitored by APM, you can set thresholds that open a violation when the heap size or number of threads for a single JVM is out of the expected operating range. We calculate alerting threshold violations individually for each of the app's selected instances. When creating your condition, select JVM health metric as the type of condition for your Java app's alert policy, then select any of the available thresholds: Deadlocked threads Heap memory usage CPU utilization time Garbage collection CPU time Violations will automatically close when the inverse of the threshold is met, but by using the UI you can also change the time when a violation force-closes for a JVM health metric. Default is 24 hours. Web transaction percentile conditions We include the option to define a percentile as the threshold for your condition when your web app's response time is above, below, or equal to this value. This is useful, for example, when Operations personnel want to alert on a percentile for an app server's overall web transaction response time rather than the average web response time. Tip If you want to set an arbitrary threshold in a condition for a non-web app transaction, use the NRQL queries feature. To define the percentile threshold: Select Web transactions percentiles as the type of condition for your APM app's condition, then select a single app. (To alert on more than one app, create an individual Web transactions percentiles condition for each.) To define the thresholds that open the violation, type the Percentile nth response time value, then select its frequency (above, below, or equal to this value). We store the transaction time in milliseconds, although the user interface shows the Critical and Warning values as seconds. If you want to define milliseconds, be sure to include the decimal point in your value. Dynamic targeting with labels for apps By applying labels to applications, you can automatically link these entities to your condition. This makes it easy to manage all the applications within a dynamic environment. We recommend using the agent configuration file to best maintain entity labels. A single label identifies all entities associated with that label (maximum 10,000 entities). Multiple labels only identify entities which share all the selected labels. Using dynamic targeting with your condition also requires that you set a violation close timer. To add, edit, or remove up to ten labels for a condition: Select APM > Application metric as the product type. When identifying entities, select the Labels tab. Search for a label by name, or select a label from the list of categories. You can also create conditions directly within the context of what you are monitoring with Infrastructure. Infrastructure conditions You can create conditions for your resources directly in Infrastructure. For example, if you want to be notified when we have stopped receiving data from an Infrastructure agent, use the host not reporting condition type. This allows you to dynamically alert on filtered groups of hosts and configure the time window from 5 to 60 minutes. Apdex and response time conditions You can open violations and send notifications for response times. However, Apdex scores are almost always more meaningful and provide a better reflection of application performance. For example, average response times can be skewed by outliers, while the Apdex score gives a more accurate assessment of acceptable response time rates that your users experience. Change a condition name If you want to change the default condition name, make it short and descriptive. Provide useful information for notification messages that have limited characters, such as email subject lines, online chat, etc. Use camel case or dotted decimal notation. Describe the essence of what is being violated. To change an existing condition's name: In the one.newrelic.com top nav, click Alerts & AI, click Alert policies, then (select a policy). Click a condition name to edit it, and then type a meaningful name for the condition. You can't edit the product and condition type associated with a condition. Instead, you must delete the condition and create a new one with a different product and condition type. Maintain policies and conditions After you save the condition, the currently selected policy lists all alert conditions that apply to it. From here you can: Repeat the steps to add more conditions to the policy. Continue the policy setup process by adding one or more notification channels to it. Change the condition's name, the entities it's scoped to, or the critical (red) and warning (yellow) thresholds. Copy the condition and add it other policies in the selected account. Rename the policy. Disable any conditions in the policy, or delete the policy or any of its conditions. You may also manage your policies via the policies NerdGraph API. View existing conditions The policies index lists them in alphabetical order. To view or search for existing conditions: In the one.newrelic.com top nav, click Alerts & AI, then click Alert policies. Use the search box, sort any column, or scroll the list, then select a policy's name to see its conditions. To view policy and condition information for a specific entity: From that entity's product UI, select Settings, then click Alert conditions.",

For .NET Core, see Compatibility and requirements for .NET Core. The agent includes built-in instrumentation for some of the most popular parts of the .NET Framework ecosystem, including frameworks, databases, and message queuing systems. After you download and install the agent, it runs within the monitored process. The agent does not create a separate process or service. For frameworks and libraries that are not automatically instrumented, you can extend the agent with .NET custom instrumentation. Want to try out New Relic's .NET agent? Create a New Relic account for free! No credit card required. Requirements Before you install New Relic's .NET agent, make sure your system meets these requirements: .NET Framework version .NET Framework 4.5 or higher .NET Framework 4.5 or higher requires the New Relic .NET agent version 7.0 or higher. .NET Framework 4.0 or lower To instrument applications running on .NET Framework version 4.0 and lower, you must run a version of the New Relic .NET agent earlier than 7.0. For more information and download procedures, see Technical support for .NET frameworks 4.0 or earlier. Here are additional details about .NET Framework versions 4.0 and lower: .NET Framework version Notes .NET Framework 2.0 Unless you have installed only .NET Framework 4.0 or higher, you must have .NET Framework version 3.5 installed on the target host, in addition to any other .NET Framework versions you have installed. .NET Framework 3.0 Unless you have installed only .NET Framework 4.0 or higher, you must have .NET Framework version 3.5 installed on the target host, in addition to any other .NET Framework versions you have installed. .NET Framework 3.5 Fully supported by .NET agent versions below 7.0. .NET Framework 4.0 Fully supported by .NET agent versions below 7.0. If you use .NET Framework 1.1 for any app on your target system, you must disable instrumentation of that app with applicationPool set to instrument=\"false\". The .NET agent can cause crashes in .NET 1.1 apps. App/web servers You must use one of these app/web servers: IIS Self-hosted OWIN Self-hosted WCF Kestrel Kestrel with IIS reverse proxy via AspNetCoreModule Kestrel with IIS reverse proxy via AspNetCoreModuleV2 The agent automatically creates transactions for apps hosted in IIS. If you self-host with WCF and OWIN version 3 or higher, the agent also automatically creates transactions. For other self-hosted services, you will need to create transactions via custom instrumentation. CLRs The agent requires CLR version 4.0. Legacy applications running on CLR 2.0 can be instrumented with agent versions earlier than 7.0. Operating system The agent requires one of these operating systems: Windows Server 2008 Windows Server 2008 R2 Windows Server 2012 Windows Server 2012 R2 Windows Server 2016 Windows Server 2019 Windows 10 Windows Azure (OS Family 1, 2, and 3) Windows containers running on Windows 2016 (NanoServer based images are not supported) Use of other monitoring software The .NET Common Language Runtime (CLR) only allows one profiler to access the profiling API of a process at any given time. Running our .NET agent alongside other monitoring software will result in a profiler conflict. For more information, see Errors while using other APM software. Microsoft Azure For Azure-specific installation instructions, see: Install on Azure Cloud Services Install on Azure Service Fabric Install on Azure Web Apps Processor architectures The agent is available in both a 32-bit and 64-bit version. On 64-bit systems, the 64-bit agent can instrument both 32-bit and 64-bit applications. Permissions Installation requires elevated privileges (Administrator). For example, you can: Be logged in as an administrator user. Be a member of the Administrators group. On newer operating systems, provide elevation credentials when prompted. The monitored process must have read/write access to the directory in which the agent is installed. The agent runs as a part of the monitored process and relies on those permissions to function. Recommendation: Restrict permissions for the newrelic.config file and give read/write access only to the owner of the monitored process. Review permissions for the logs created by the agent to minimize the number of users with access and their privileges. Security requirements As a standard security measure for data collection, your app server must support SHA-2 (256-bit). SHA-1 is not supported. Code Access Security The use of Code Access Security is compatible with the .NET agent only when Full Trust is provided. The agent is not compatible with more restrictive trust levels. Network requirements The agent requires your firewall to allow outgoing connections to specific networks and ports. Application lifespan The .NET agent uploads data at the end of each harvest cycle (once per minute). If your .NET app doesn't run that long, you can set the service element's sendDataOnExit attribute to true in the newrelic.config file. Automatic instrumentation If your application is hosted in ASP.NET or another fully supported framework, the .NET agent will automatically instrument your application after install. If your app is not automatically instrumented, or if you want to add instrumentation, use custom instrumentation. The .NET agent does not directly monitor datastore processes. Also, by default the .NET SQL parameter capture in a query trace does not list parameters for a parameterized query or a stored procedure. Collection of the SQL query parameters can be enabled in the agent configuration. App frameworks The agent automatically instruments some application frameworks; we refer to these frameworks as fully supported. Compatibility status .NET app frameworks Fully supported These frameworks are fully supported: ASP.NET MVC 2 ASP.NET MVC 3 ASP.NET MVC 4 ASP.NET MVC 5 ASP.NET Web API v2 ASP.NET Core MVC 2.0 ASP.NET Core 2.1 ASP.NET Core 2.2 ASP.NET Web Forms Castle MonoRail v2 (not the same as Mono) OWIN-hosted web API applications on .NET framework using: Microsoft.Owin.Host.HttpListener v2.x Microsoft.Owin.Host.HttpListener v3.x Microsoft.Owin.Host.HttpListener v4.x SOAP-based web services WCF Hosting Models IIS Hosted (with and without ASP Compatibility) Self Hosted Binding Types (both client and service) WCF Instrumentation has been tested for the following common binding types. Varying levels of support are available for distributed tracing (DT) and cross application tracing (CAT): Binding Distributed Tracing (DT) Support Cross Application Tracing (CAT) Support BasicHTTP supported supported WebHTTP supported supported WSHTTP supported supported NetTCP supported supported NetNamedPipe not supported * not supported * NetMSMQ not supported * not supported * * Distributed tracing may be manually implemented using these Distributed Tracing API methods. Invocation Methods (both client and service) Synchronous Asynchronous Processing Model (APM) Begin/End Task Asynchronous Processing (TAP) Event-based Asynchronous Processing (EAP) Client support only. Not fully supported These frameworks are not fully supported: ASP.NET Web API v1: See the troubleshooting information about using ASP.NET Web API v1 with New Relic's .NET agent 5.0 or higher for apps targeting .NET Framework 4.0. (This does not affect .NET Framework 4.5 or higher.) Mono: New Relic does not support Mono, an open-source .NET framework that runs on Linux. This is because there is no Profiler API to inject into the .NET agent as a profiler into Mono-based .NET applications. The Profiler API is a Component Object Model (COM)-based interface and is not supported on Linux. Not supported Classic ASP is not supported, because the agent can only instrument .NET Framework-based apps. Sharepoint is not supported. Datastores Collecting instance details for supported datastores requires .NET agent version 6.5.29.0 or higher and is enabled by default. To request instance-level information from datastores not currently listed, get support at support.newrelic.com. In order to automatically instrument the performance of .NET Framework application calls to these datastores, make sure you have the .NET agent version 8.14 or higher: Datastore Instance details Other notes Couchbase SDK version 2.x.x (2.4.0 or higher is not supported). With Couchbase, the following are not instrumented by default in favor of their multi-document counterparts: Get(string key) GetDocument(string key) Remove(string key) Remove(string key, ulong cas) Upsert<T>(string key, T value) IBM DB2 Microsoft SQL Server MongoDB We support both the modern and legacy MongoDB drivers. Legacy - mongocsharpdriver Driver versions 1.10.0 or earlier: Instance details are not available in these driver versions. Modern - MongoDB.Driver Driver version 2.3.x - 2.13.x: The .NET agent will support instrumenting pre-exising and new API methods in 2.6.x, but not new methods introduced in 2.7.x and higher. MySQL Use MySql.Data version 6.10.4 or later, or use the MySQL Connector Oracle PostgreSQL Use Npgsql 4.0. Prior versions of Npgsql may also be instrumented, but duplicate and/or missing metrics are possible. ServiceStack.Redis StackExchange.Redis Messaging The agent automatically instruments these message systems: MSMQ: Puts and takes on messages NServiceBus 5.0 (6.0 or higher not supported): Puts and takes on messages and cross application tracing RabbitMQ 3.5 or higher: Puts and takes on messages and queue purge. When receiving messages using an IBasicConsumer, the EventingBasicConsumer is the only implementation that is instrumented by the .NET agent. BasicGet is instrumented, but the agent does not support distributed tracing for BasicGet. The following methods are instrumented: IModel.BasicGet IModel.BasicPublish IModel.BasicComsume IModel.QueuePurge EventingBasicConsumer.HandleBasicDeliver CMS The agent automatically instruments the EPiServer content management system. External call libraries The agent automatically instruments these external call libraries : Libraries Supported methods HttpClient The agent instruments these HttpClient methods: SendAsync GetAsync PostAsync PutAsync DeleteAsync GetStringAsync GetStreamAsync GetByteArrayAsync RestSharp The agent instruments these RestSharp methods: ExecuteTaskAsync ExecuteGetTaskAsync ExecutePostTaskAsync Execute ExecuteAsGet ExecuteAsPost DownloadData HttpWebRequest The agent instruments these HttpWebRequest methods: GetResponse Connect the agent to other New Relic products In addition to APM, the agent integrates with other New Relic products to give you end-to-end visibility: Product Integration Browser monitoring For ASP.NET applications, the .NET agent automatically injects the browser JavaScript agent when you enable auto-instrumentation. After enabling browser injection, you can view browser data in the APM Summary page and quickly switch between the APM and browser data for a particular app. For configuration options and manual instrumentation, see Browser monitoring and the .NET agent. Automatic browser injection is not supported for ASP.NET core applications. Infrastructure monitoring When you install the Infrastructure and APM agents on the same host, they automatically detect one another. You can then view a list of hosts in the APM UI, and filter your Infrastructure hosts by APM app in the Infrastructure UI. For more information, see APM data in Infrastructure. Dashboards The .NET agent sends default events and attributes for NRQL queries. You can also record custom events for advanced analysis. Synthetic monitoring Synthetic transaction traces connect requests from Synthetics monitors to the underlying APM transaction.",

      "body": "New Relic's .NET agent supports both .NET Framework and .NET Core. This document describes compatibility and support for .NET Core applications. See Compatibility and requirements for .NET Framework for .NET Framework applications. New Relic's .NET agent includes built-in instrumentation for some of the most popular parts of the .NET Core ecosystem, including frameworks, databases, and message queuing systems. After installation, the agent runs within the monitored process; there is not a separate process or service created by the agent. For frameworks and libraries that are not automatically instrumented out of the box, you can extend the agent with .NET custom instrumentation. Want to try out our .NET agent? Create a New Relic account for free! No credit card required. Requirements Before you install the New Relic .NET agent on Windows or Linux, make sure your system meets these requirements: Microsoft .NET Core version The .NET agent supports .NET Core versions 2.0, 2.1, 2.2, 3.0, 3.1, and .NET 5.0. Table of minimum agent versions required per .NET Core version .NET Core Version Minimum Required .NET Agent Version .NET Core 2.0 > = 8.19.353.0 .NET Core 2.1 > = 8.19.353.0 .NET Core 2.2 > = 8.19.353.0 .NET Core 3.0 > = 8.21.34.0 .NET Core 3.1 > = 8.21.34.0 .NET 5.0 > = 8.35.0 The agent is not compatible with .NET Core versions 1.0 or 1.1. For .NET Core 2.1 or higher applications with tiered compilation enabled, the agent will disable tiered compilation. .NET Core 2.1 support requires .NET Core runtime 2.1.3 and .NET Core SDK 2.1.401 or higher due to a bug in the .NET Core profiling API. Target framework version The .NET agent only supports applications targeting .NET Core 2.0, 2.1, 2.2, 3.0, 3.1, and NET 5.0. You can find the target framework in your .csproj file: Supported: <TargetFramework>netcoreapp2.0</TargetFramework> Copy <TargetFramework>netcoreapp2.1</TargetFramework> Copy <TargetFramework>netcoreapp2.2</TargetFramework> Copy <TargetFramework>netcoreapp3.0</TargetFramework> Copy <TargetFramework>netcoreapp3.1</TargetFramework> Copy <TargetFramework>net5.0</TargetFramework> Copy Unsupported: <TargetFramework>net452</TargetFramework> Copy Important If you want to monitor an ASP.NET Core application targeting .NET Framework, ensure your install of the .NET agent has .NET Framework support enabled. App/web servers Ensure you use one of these app/web servers: Kestrel Kestrel with IIS reverse proxy via AspNetCoreModule Kestrel with IIS reverse proxy via AspNetCoreModuleV2 Kestrel with Nginx reverse proxy Kestrel with Apache reverse proxy Operating system The agent has been verified to work with the following operating systems: Operating system Supported versions Windows (32- and 64-bit Intel compatible architectures) Server 2008 R2 SP1 Server 2012 Server 2012 R2 Server 2016 Server 2019 Windows containers running on Server 2016 (NanoServer based images are not supported) Linux (64-bit Intel compatible only) All x64 Linux distributions supported by the .NET Core 2.0+/.NET 5 runtime are supported by the .NET agent. For a full list, refer to Microsoft's documentation for the version of the runtime you are using. Microsoft Azure For Azure-specific installation instructions, see: Install on Azure Cloud Services Install on Azure Service Fabric Install on Azure Web Apps Processor architectures The agent is available in both 32-bit (x86) and 64-bit (x64) versions on Windows as well as 64-bit (x64) on Linux. Permissions Installing and running the .NET agent requires these permissions: Component Necessary permissions Install the agent The process or user that installs the agent must have sufficient permissions to set environment variables and write access to the directory where the agent is installed. Run the agent The monitored process must have read/write access to the directory in which you installed the agent. The agent runs as a part of the monitored process and relies on those permissions to function. For applications using IIS via reverse proxy, the group IIS_IUSRS is often used. Security requirements As a standard security measure for data collection, your app server must support SHA-2 (256-bit). SHA-1 is not supported. Network requirements The agent requires your firewall to allow outgoing connections to specific networks and ports. Automatic instrumentation If your application is hosted in ASP.NET Core, the agent automatically creates and instruments transactions. The .NET agent will automatically instrument your application after install. If your app is not automatically instrumented, or if you want to add instrumentation, use custom instrumentation. App frameworks The .NET agent automatically instruments these application frameworks: ASP.NET Core MVC 2.0, 2.1, 2.2, 3.0, 3.1, and 5.0 (includes Web API) Datastores The .NET agent automatically instruments the performance of .NET application calls to these datastores: Datastore Instance details Notes Microsoft SQL Server Use System.Data.SqlClient version 4.3.1 or Microsoft.Data.SqlClient. PostgresSQL Use Npgsql 4.0. Prior versions of Npgsql may also be instrumented, but duplicate and/or missing metrics are possible. MongoDB Driver version 2.3.x - 2.13.x: The .NET agent will support instrumenting pre-exising and new API methods in 2.6.x, but not new methods introduced in 2.7.x and higher. MySQL Use MySql.Data version 6.10.4 or later, or use the MySQL Connector StackExchange.Redis The .NET agent does not directly monitor datastore processes. Also, the .NET SQL parameter capture in a query trace does not list parameters for a parameterized query or a stored procedure. Collecting instance details for supported datastores is enabled by default. To request instance-level information from datastores not currently listed, get support at support.newrelic.com. External call libraries The .NET agent automatically instruments these external call libraries : Libraries Supported methods HttpClient The agent instruments these HttpClient methods: SendAsync GetAsync PostAsync PutAsync DeleteAsync GetStringAsync GetStreamAsync GetByteArrayAsync Messaging The agent automatically instruments these message systems: RabbitMQ 5.1.0 or higher: Puts and takes on messages and queue purge. When receiving messages using an IBasicConsumer, the EventingBasicConsumer is the only implementation that is instrumented by the .NET agent. BasicGet is instrumented, but the agent does not support distributed tracing for BasicGet. The following methods are instrumented: IModel.BasicGet IModel.BasicPublish IModel.BasicComsume IModel.QueuePurge EventingBasicConsumer.HandleBasicDeliver Unavailable features The following features are not available for the .NET agent: Memory usage on Linux due to an ongoing .NET Core issue (try using .NET performance metrics to get this information) Automatic brower monitoring script injection (API or manual instrumentation is required) The .NET agent does not support trim self-contained deployments and executables, because the compiler can potentially trim assemblies that the agent depends on. Infinite Tracing is not supported on Alpine Linux due to a GRPC compatibility issue. See this agent issue for more information. Connect the agent to other New Relic products In addition to APM, the .NET agent integrates with other New Relic products to give you end-to-end visibility: Product Integration Browser monitoring The browser monitoring JavaScript agent will not be injected by the .NET agent for ASP.NET core applications. However, you can inject the browser agent by using the .NET agent API or the browser agent's copy/paste method. After enabling browser injection, you can view browser data in the APM Summary page and quickly switch between the APM and browser data for a particular app. For configuration options and manual instrumentation, see browser monitoring and the .NET agent. Infrastructure monitoring When you install the Infrastructure and APM agents on the same host, they automatically detect one another.

      "body": "As applications move towards the cloud, microservices architecture is becoming more dispersed, making the ability to monitor logs essential. New Relic offers a fast, scalable log management platform so you can connect your logs with the rest of your telemetry and infrastructure data in a single place. Our log management solution provides deeper visibility into application and infrastructure performance data (events and errors) to reduce mean-time-to-resolve (MTTR) and quickly troubleshoot production incidents. It does this by providing super-fast searching capabilities, alerts, and co-location of application, infrastructure, and log data, while visualizing everything from a single place. Find problems faster, reduce context switching Log management provides a way to connect your log data with the rest of your application and infrastructure data, allowing you to get to the root cause of problems quickly, without losing context switching between tools. Log management features include: Instantly search through your logs. Visualize your log data directly from the Logs UI. Use logging data to create custom charts, dashboards, and alerts. Troubleshoot performance issues without switching between tools. Bring in your logging data To bring your log data into New Relic, you can: Use our infrastructure monitoring agent as a lightweight data collector, without having to install additional software. Select from a wide range of log forwarding plugins, including Amazon, Microsoft, Fluentd, Fluent Bit, Kubernetes, Logstash, and more. Use our OpenTelemetry solutions. Send your log data by using the Log API or TCP endpoint. Once log management is enabled, you can also connect your logs with your APM agent, Kubernetes clusters, or distributed tracing to get additional contextual logging data with our logs in context extensions. View your logging data in New Relic You can explore your logging data in the UI or by API: Logs UI at one.newrelic.com Logs UI for EU region data center if applicable: one.eu.newrelic.com You can also query the Log data type.

Requirements Before you install New Relic's .NET agent, make sure your system meets these requirements: .NET Framework version .NET Framework 4.5 or higher .NET Framework 4.5 or higher requires the New Relic .NET agent version 7.0 or higher. .NET Framework 4.0 or lower To instrument applications running on .NET Framework version 4.0 and lower, you must run a version of the New Relic .NET agent earlier than 7.0. For more information and download procedures, see Technical support for .NET frameworks 4.0 or earlier. Here are additional details about .NET Framework versions 4.0 and lower: .NET Framework version Notes .NET Framework 2.0 Unless you have installed only .NET Framework 4.0 or higher, you must have .NET Framework version 3.5 installed on the target host, in addition to any other .NET Framework versions you have installed. .NET Framework 3.0 Unless you have installed only .NET Framework 4.0 or higher, you must have .NET Framework version 3.5 installed on the target host, in addition to any other .NET Framework versions you have installed. .NET Framework 3.5 Fully supported by .NET agent versions below 7.0. .NET Framework 4.0 Fully supported by .NET agent versions below 7.0. If you use .NET Framework 1.1 for any app on your target system, you must disable instrumentation of that app with applicationPool set to instrument=\"false\". The .NET agent can cause crashes in .NET 1.1 apps. App/web servers You must use one of these app/web servers: IIS Self-hosted OWIN Self-hosted WCF Kestrel Kestrel with IIS reverse proxy via AspNetCoreModule Kestrel with IIS reverse proxy via AspNetCoreModuleV2 The agent automatically creates transactions for apps hosted in IIS. If you self-host with WCF and OWIN version 3 or higher, the agent also automatically creates transactions. For other self-hosted services, you will need to create transactions via custom instrumentation. CLRs The agent requires CLR version 4.0. Legacy applications running on CLR 2.0 can be instrumented with agent versions earlier than 7.0. Operating system The agent requires one of these operating systems: Windows Server 2008 Windows Server 2008 R2 Windows Server 2012 Windows Server 2012 R2 Windows Server 2016 Windows Server 2019 Windows 10 Windows Azure (OS Family 1, 2, and 3) Windows containers running on Windows 2016 (NanoServer based images are not supported) Use of other monitoring software The .NET Common Language Runtime (CLR) only allows one profiler to access the profiling API of a process at any given time. Running our .NET agent alongside other monitoring software will result in a profiler conflict. For more information, see Errors while using other APM software. Microsoft Azure For Azure-specific installation instructions, see: Install on Azure Cloud Services Install on Azure Service Fabric Install on Azure Web Apps Processor architectures The agent is available in both a 32-bit and 64-bit version.

Compatibility status .NET app frameworks Fully supported These frameworks are fully supported: ASP.NET MVC 2 ASP.NET MVC 3 ASP.NET MVC 4 ASP.NET MVC 5 ASP.NET Web API v2 ASP.NET Core MVC 2.0 ASP.NET Core 2.1 ASP.NET Core 2.2 ASP.NET Web Forms Castle MonoRail v2 (not the same as Mono) OWIN-hosted web API applications on .NET framework using: Microsoft.Owin.Host.HttpListener v2.x Microsoft.Owin.Host.HttpListener v3.x Microsoft.Owin.Host.HttpListener v4.x SOAP-based web services WCF Hosting Models IIS Hosted (with and without ASP Compatibility) Self Hosted Binding Types (both client and service) WCF Instrumentation has been tested for the following common binding types. Varying levels of support are available for distributed tracing (DT) and cross application tracing (CAT): Binding Distributed Tracing (DT) Support Cross Application Tracing (CAT) Support BasicHTTP supported supported WebHTTP supported supported WSHTTP supported supported NetTCP supported supported NetNamedPipe not supported * not supported * NetMSMQ not supported * not supported * * Distributed tracing may be manually implemented using these Distributed Tracing API methods. Invocation Methods (both client and service) Synchronous Asynchronous Processing Model (APM) Begin/End Task Asynchronous Processing (TAP) Event-based Asynchronous Processing (EAP) Client support only. Not fully supported These frameworks are not fully supported: ASP.NET Web API v1: See the troubleshooting information about using ASP.NET Web API v1 with New Relic's .NET agent 5.0 or higher for apps targeting .NET Framework 4.0. (This does not affect .NET Framework 4.5 or higher.) Mono: New Relic does not support Mono, an open-source .NET framework that runs on Linux. This is because there is no Profiler API to inject into the .NET agent as a profiler into Mono-based .NET applications. The Profiler API is a Component Object Model (COM)-based interface and is not supported on Linux. Not supported Classic ASP is not supported, because the agent can only instrument .NET Framework-based apps. Sharepoint is not supported. Datastores Collecting instance details for supported datastores requires .NET agent version 6.5.29.0 or higher and is enabled by default. To request instance-level information from datastores not currently listed, get support at support.newrelic.com. In order to automatically instrument the performance of .NET Framework application calls to these datastores, make sure you have the .NET agent version 8.14 or higher: Datastore Instance details Other notes Couchbase SDK version 2.x.x (2.4.0 or higher is not supported). With Couchbase, the following are not instrumented by default in favor of their multi-document counterparts: Get(string key) GetDocument(string key) Remove(string key) Remove(string key, ulong cas) Upsert<T>(string key, T value) IBM DB2 Microsoft SQL Server MongoDB We support both the modern and legacy MongoDB drivers. Legacy - mongocsharpdriver Driver versions 1.10.0 or earlier: Instance details are not available in these driver versions. Modern - MongoDB.Driver Driver version 2.3.x - 2.13.x: The .NET agent will support instrumenting pre-exising and new API methods in 2.6.x, but not new methods introduced in 2.7.x and higher. MySQL Use MySql.Data version 6.10.4 or later, or use the MySQL Connector Oracle PostgreSQL Use Npgsql 4.0. Prior versions of Npgsql may also be instrumented, but duplicate and/or missing metrics are possible. ServiceStack.Redis StackExchange.Redis Messaging The agent automatically instruments these message systems: MSMQ: Puts and takes on messages NServiceBus 5.0 (6.0 or higher not supported): Puts and takes on messages and cross application tracing RabbitMQ 3.5 or higher: Puts and takes on messages and queue purge. When receiving messages using an IBasicConsumer, the EventingBasicConsumer is the only implementation that is instrumented by the .NET agent. BasicGet is instrumented, but the agent does not support distributed tracing for BasicGet. The following methods are instrumented: IModel.BasicGet IModel.BasicPublish IModel.BasicComsume IModel.QueuePurge EventingBasicConsumer.HandleBasicDeliver CMS The agent automatically instruments the EPiServer content management system. External call libraries The agent automatically instruments these external call libraries : Libraries Supported methods HttpClient The agent instruments these HttpClient methods: SendAsync GetAsync PostAsync PutAsync DeleteAsync GetStringAsync GetStreamAsync GetByteArrayAsync RestSharp The agent instruments these RestSharp methods: ExecuteTaskAsync ExecuteGetTaskAsync ExecutePostTaskAsync Execute ExecuteAsGet ExecuteAsPost DownloadData HttpWebRequest The agent instruments these HttpWebRequest methods: GetResponse Connect the agent to other New Relic products In addition to APM, the agent integrates with other New Relic products to give you end-to-end visibility: Product Integration Browser monitoring For ASP.NET applications, the .NET agent automatically injects the browser JavaScript agent when you enable auto-instrumentation.

      "body": "New Relic's .NET agent supports both .NET Framework and .NET Core. This document describes compatibility and support for .NET Core applications. See Compatibility and requirements for .NET Framework for .NET Framework applications. New Relic's .NET agent includes built-in instrumentation for some of the most popular parts of the .NET Core ecosystem, including frameworks, databases, and message queuing systems. After installation, the agent runs within the monitored process; there is not a separate process or service created by the agent. For frameworks and libraries that are not automatically instrumented out of the box, you can extend the agent with .NET custom instrumentation. Want to try out our .NET agent? Create a New Relic account for free! No credit card required. Requirements Before you install the New Relic .NET agent on Windows or Linux, make sure your system meets these requirements: Microsoft .NET Core version The .NET agent supports .NET Core versions 2.0, 2.1, 2.2, 3.0, 3.1, and .NET 5.0. Table of minimum agent versions required per .NET Core version .NET Core Version Minimum Required .NET Agent Version .NET Core 2.0 > = 8.19.353.0 .NET Core 2.1 > = 8.19.353.0 .NET Core 2.2 > = 8.19.353.0 .NET Core 3.0 > = 8.21.34.0 .NET Core 3.1 > = 8.21.34.0 .NET 5.0 > = 8.35.0 The agent is not compatible with .NET Core versions 1.0 or 1.1. For .NET Core 2.1 or higher applications with tiered compilation enabled, the agent will disable tiered compilation. .NET Core 2.1 support requires .NET Core runtime 2.1.3 and .NET Core SDK 2.1.401 or higher due to a bug in the .NET Core profiling API. Target framework version The .NET agent only supports applications targeting .NET Core 2.0, 2.1, 2.2, 3.0, 3.1, and NET 5.0. You can find the target framework in your .csproj file: Supported: <TargetFramework>netcoreapp2.0</TargetFramework> Copy <TargetFramework>netcoreapp2.1</TargetFramework> Copy <TargetFramework>netcoreapp2.2</TargetFramework> Copy <TargetFramework>netcoreapp3.0</TargetFramework> Copy <TargetFramework>netcoreapp3.1</TargetFramework> Copy <TargetFramework>net5.0</TargetFramework> Copy Unsupported: <TargetFramework>net452</TargetFramework> Copy Important If you want to monitor an ASP.NET Core application targeting .NET Framework, ensure your install of the .NET agent has .NET Framework support enabled. App/web servers Ensure you use one of these app/web servers: Kestrel Kestrel with IIS reverse proxy via AspNetCoreModule Kestrel with IIS reverse proxy via AspNetCoreModuleV2 Kestrel with Nginx reverse proxy Kestrel with Apache reverse proxy Operating system The agent has been verified to work with the following operating systems: Operating system Supported versions Windows (32- and 64-bit Intel compatible architectures) Server 2008 R2 SP1 Server 2012 Server 2012 R2 Server 2016 Server 2019 Windows containers running on Server 2016 (NanoServer based images are not supported) Linux (64-bit Intel compatible only) All x64 Linux distributions supported by the .NET Core 2.0+/.NET 5 runtime are supported by the .NET agent. For a full list, refer to Microsoft's documentation for the version of the runtime you are using. Microsoft Azure For Azure-specific installation instructions, see: Install on Azure Cloud Services Install on Azure Service Fabric Install on Azure Web Apps Processor architectures The agent is available in both 32-bit (x86) and 64-bit (x64) versions on Windows as well as 64-bit (x64) on Linux. Permissions Installing and running the .NET agent requires these permissions: Component Necessary permissions Install the agent The process or user that installs the agent must have sufficient permissions to set environment variables and write access to the directory where the agent is installed. Run the agent The monitored process must have read/write access to the directory in which you installed the agent. The agent runs as a part of the monitored process and relies on those permissions to function. For applications using IIS via reverse proxy, the group IIS_IUSRS is often used. Security requirements As a standard security measure for data collection, your app server must support SHA-2 (256-bit). SHA-1 is not supported. Network requirements The agent requires your firewall to allow outgoing connections to specific networks and ports. Automatic instrumentation If your application is hosted in ASP.NET Core, the agent automatically creates and instruments transactions. The .NET agent will automatically instrument your application after install. If your app is not automatically instrumented, or if you want to add instrumentation, use custom instrumentation. App frameworks The .NET agent automatically instruments these application frameworks: ASP.NET Core MVC 2.0, 2.1, 2.2, 3.0, 3.1, and 5.0 (includes Web API) Datastores The .NET agent automatically instruments the performance of .NET application calls to these datastores: Datastore Instance details Notes Microsoft SQL Server Use System.Data.SqlClient version 4.3.1 or Microsoft.Data.SqlClient. PostgresSQL Use Npgsql 4.0. Prior versions of Npgsql may also be instrumented, but duplicate and/or missing metrics are possible. MongoDB Driver version 2.3.x - 2.13.x: The .NET agent will support instrumenting pre-exising and new API methods in 2.6.x, but not new methods introduced in 2.7.x and higher. MySQL Use MySql.Data version 6.10.4 or later, or use the MySQL Connector StackExchange.Redis The .NET agent does not directly monitor datastore processes. Also, the .NET SQL parameter capture in a query trace does not list parameters for a parameterized query or a stored procedure. Collecting instance details for supported datastores is enabled by default. To request instance-level information from datastores not currently listed, get support at support.newrelic.com. External call libraries The .NET agent automatically instruments these external call libraries : Libraries Supported methods HttpClient The agent instruments these HttpClient methods: SendAsync GetAsync PostAsync PutAsync DeleteAsync GetStringAsync GetStreamAsync GetByteArrayAsync Messaging The agent automatically instruments these message systems: RabbitMQ 5.1.0 or higher: Puts and takes on messages and queue purge. When receiving messages using an IBasicConsumer, the EventingBasicConsumer is the only implementation that is instrumented by the .NET agent. BasicGet is instrumented, but the agent does not support distributed tracing for BasicGet. The following methods are instrumented: IModel.BasicGet IModel.BasicPublish IModel.BasicComsume IModel.QueuePurge EventingBasicConsumer.HandleBasicDeliver Unavailable features The following features are not available for the .NET agent: Memory usage on Linux due to an ongoing .NET Core issue (try using .NET performance metrics to get this information) Automatic brower monitoring script injection (API or manual instrumentation is required) The .NET agent does not support trim self-contained deployments and executables, because the compiler can potentially trim assemblies that the agent depends on. Infinite Tracing is not supported on Alpine Linux due to a GRPC compatibility issue. See this agent issue for more information. Connect the agent to other New Relic products In addition to APM, the .NET agent integrates with other New Relic products to give you end-to-end visibility: Product Integration Browser monitoring The browser monitoring JavaScript agent will not be injected by the .NET agent for ASP.NET core applications. However, you can inject the browser agent by using the .NET agent API or the browser agent's copy/paste method. After enabling browser injection, you can view browser data in the APM Summary page and quickly switch between the APM and browser data for a particular app. For configuration options and manual instrumentation, see browser monitoring and the .NET agent. Infrastructure monitoring When you install the Infrastructure and APM agents on the same host, they automatically detect one another. You can then view a list of hosts in the APM UI, and filter your Infrastructure hosts by APM app in the Infrastructure UI. For more information, see APM data in Infrastructure.

      "body": "As applications move towards the cloud, microservices architecture is becoming more dispersed, making the ability to monitor logs essential. New Relic offers a fast, scalable log management platform so you can connect your logs with the rest of your telemetry and infrastructure data in a single place. Our log management solution provides deeper visibility into application and infrastructure performance data (events and errors) to reduce mean-time-to-resolve (MTTR) and quickly troubleshoot production incidents. It does this by providing super-fast searching capabilities, alerts, and co-location of application, infrastructure, and log data, while visualizing everything from a single place. Find problems faster, reduce context switching Log management provides a way to connect your log data with the rest of your application and infrastructure data, allowing you to get to the root cause of problems quickly, without losing context switching between tools. Log management features include: Instantly search through your logs. Visualize your log data directly from the Logs UI. Use logging data to create custom charts, dashboards, and alerts. Troubleshoot performance issues without switching between tools. Bring in your logging data To bring your log data into New Relic, you can: Use our infrastructure monitoring agent as a lightweight data collector, without having to install additional software. Select from a wide range of log forwarding plugins, including Amazon, Microsoft, Fluentd, Fluent Bit, Kubernetes, Logstash, and more. Use our OpenTelemetry solutions. Send your log data by using the Log API or TCP endpoint. Once log management is enabled, you can also connect your logs with your APM agent, Kubernetes clusters, or distributed tracing to get additional contextual logging data with our logs in context extensions. View your logging data in New Relic You can explore your logging data in the UI or by API: Logs UI at one.newrelic.com Logs UI for EU region data center if applicable: one.eu.newrelic.com You can also query the Log data type.

Create a New Relic account for free! No credit card required. Requirements Before you install New Relic's .NET agent, make sure your system meets these requirements: .NET Framework version .NET Framework 4.5 or higher .NET Framework 4.5 or higher requires the New Relic .NET agent version 7.0 or higher. .NET Framework 4.0 or lower To instrument applications running on .NET Framework version 4.0 and lower, you must run a version of the New Relic .NET agent earlier than 7.0. For more information and download procedures, see Technical support for .NET frameworks 4.0 or earlier. Here are additional details about .NET Framework versions 4.0 and lower: .NET Framework version Notes .NET Framework 2.0 Unless you have installed only .NET Framework 4.0 or higher, you must have .NET Framework version 3.5 installed on the target host, in addition to any other .NET Framework versions you have installed. .NET Framework 3.0 Unless you have installed only .NET Framework 4.0 or higher, you must have .NET Framework version 3.5 installed on the target host, in addition to any other .NET Framework versions you have installed. .NET Framework 3.5 Fully supported by .NET agent versions below 7.0. .NET Framework 4.0 Fully supported by .NET agent versions below 7.0. If you use .NET Framework 1.1 for any app on your target system, you must disable instrumentation of that app with applicationPool set to instrument=\"false\". The .NET agent can cause crashes in .NET 1.1 apps. App/web servers You must use one of these app/web servers: IIS Self-hosted OWIN Self-hosted WCF Kestrel Kestrel with IIS reverse proxy via AspNetCoreModule Kestrel with IIS reverse proxy via AspNetCoreModuleV2 The agent automatically creates transactions for apps hosted in IIS. If you self-host with WCF and OWIN version 3 or higher, the agent also automatically creates transactions. For other self-hosted services, you will need to create transactions via custom instrumentation. CLRs The agent requires CLR version 4.0. Legacy applications running on CLR 2.0 can be instrumented with agent versions earlier than 7.0. Operating system The agent requires one of these operating systems: Windows Server 2008 Windows Server 2008 R2 Windows Server 2012 Windows Server 2012 R2 Windows Server 2016 Windows Server 2019 Windows 10 Windows Azure (OS Family 1, 2, and 3) Windows containers running on Windows 2016 (NanoServer based images are not supported) Use of other monitoring software The .NET Common Language Runtime (CLR) only allows one profiler to access the profiling API of a process at any given time. Running our .NET agent alongside other monitoring software will result in a profiler conflict. For more information, see Errors while using other APM software. Microsoft Azure For Azure-specific installation instructions, see: Install on Azure Cloud Services Install on Azure Service Fabric Install on Azure Web Apps Processor architectures The agent is available in both a 32-bit and 64-bit version. On 64-bit systems, the 64-bit agent can instrument both 32-bit and 64-bit applications. Permissions Installation requires elevated privileges (Administrator). For example, you can: Be logged in as an administrator user. Be a member of the Administrators group. On newer operating systems, provide elevation credentials when prompted. The monitored process must have read/write access to the directory in which the agent is installed. The agent runs as a part of the monitored process and relies on those permissions to function. Recommendation: Restrict permissions for the newrelic.config file and give read/write access only to the owner of the monitored process. Review permissions for the logs created by the agent to minimize the number of users with access and their privileges. Security requirements As a standard security measure for data collection, your app server must support SHA-2 (256-bit). SHA-1 is not supported. Code Access Security The use of Code Access Security is compatible with the .NET agent only when Full Trust is provided. The agent is not compatible with more restrictive trust levels. Network requirements The agent requires your firewall to allow outgoing connections to specific networks and ports. Application lifespan The .NET agent uploads data at the end of each harvest cycle (once per minute). If your .NET app doesn't run that long, you can set the service element's sendDataOnExit attribute to true in the newrelic.config file. Automatic instrumentation If your application is hosted in ASP.NET or another fully supported framework, the .NET agent will automatically instrument your application after install. If your app is not automatically instrumented, or if you want to add instrumentation, use custom instrumentation. The .NET agent does not directly monitor datastore processes. Also, by default the .NET SQL parameter capture in a query trace does not list parameters for a parameterized query or a stored procedure. Collection of the SQL query parameters can be enabled in the agent configuration. App frameworks The agent automatically instruments some application frameworks; we refer to these frameworks as fully supported. Compatibility status .NET app frameworks Fully supported These frameworks are fully supported: ASP.NET MVC 2 ASP.NET MVC 3 ASP.NET MVC 4 ASP.NET MVC 5 ASP.NET Web API v2 ASP.NET Core MVC 2.0 ASP.NET Core 2.1 ASP.NET Core 2.2 ASP.NET Web Forms Castle MonoRail v2 (not the same as Mono) OWIN-hosted web API applications on .NET framework using: Microsoft.Owin.Host.HttpListener v2.x Microsoft.Owin.Host.HttpListener v3.x Microsoft.Owin.Host.HttpListener v4.x SOAP-based web services WCF Hosting Models IIS Hosted (with and without ASP Compatibility) Self Hosted Binding Types (both client and service) WCF Instrumentation has been tested for the following common binding types.

Invocation Methods (both client and service) Synchronous Asynchronous Processing Model (APM) Begin/End Task Asynchronous Processing (TAP) Event-based Asynchronous Processing (EAP) Client support only. Not fully supported These frameworks are not fully supported: ASP.NET Web API v1: See the troubleshooting information about using ASP.NET Web API v1 with New Relic's .NET agent 5.0 or higher for apps targeting .NET Framework 4.0. (This does not affect .NET Framework 4.5 or higher.) Mono: New Relic does not support Mono, an open-source .NET framework that runs on Linux. This is because there is no Profiler API to inject into the .NET agent as a profiler into Mono-based .NET applications. The Profiler API is a Component Object Model (COM)-based interface and is not supported on Linux. Not supported Classic ASP is not supported, because the agent can only instrument .NET Framework-based apps. Sharepoint is not supported. Datastores Collecting instance details for supported datastores requires .NET agent version 6.5.29.0 or higher and is enabled by default. To request instance-level information from datastores not currently listed, get support at support.newrelic.com. In order to automatically instrument the performance of .NET Framework application calls to these datastores, make sure you have the .NET agent version 8.14 or higher: Datastore Instance details Other notes Couchbase SDK version 2.x.x (2.4.0 or higher is not supported). With Couchbase, the following are not instrumented by default in favor of their multi-document counterparts: Get(string key) GetDocument(string key) Remove(string key) Remove(string key, ulong cas) Upsert<T>(string key, T value) IBM DB2 Microsoft SQL Server MongoDB We support both the modern and legacy MongoDB drivers. Legacy - mongocsharpdriver Driver versions 1.10.0 or earlier: Instance details are not available in these driver versions. Modern - MongoDB.Driver Driver version 2.3.x - 2.13.x: The .NET agent will support instrumenting pre-exising and new API methods in 2.6.x, but not new methods introduced in 2.7.x and higher. MySQL Use MySql.Data version 6.10.4 or later, or use the MySQL Connector Oracle PostgreSQL Use Npgsql 4.0. Prior versions of Npgsql may also be instrumented, but duplicate and/or missing metrics are possible. ServiceStack.Redis StackExchange.Redis Messaging The agent automatically instruments these message systems: MSMQ: Puts and takes on messages NServiceBus 5.0 (6.0 or higher not supported): Puts and takes on messages and cross application tracing RabbitMQ 3.5 or higher: Puts and takes on messages and queue purge. When receiving messages using an IBasicConsumer, the EventingBasicConsumer is the only implementation that is instrumented by the .NET agent. BasicGet is instrumented, but the agent does not support distributed tracing for BasicGet. The following methods are instrumented: IModel.BasicGet IModel.BasicPublish IModel.BasicComsume IModel.QueuePurge EventingBasicConsumer.HandleBasicDeliver CMS The agent automatically instruments the EPiServer content management system. External call libraries The agent automatically instruments these external call libraries : Libraries Supported methods HttpClient The agent instruments these HttpClient methods: SendAsync GetAsync PostAsync PutAsync DeleteAsync GetStringAsync GetStreamAsync GetByteArrayAsync RestSharp The agent instruments these RestSharp methods: ExecuteTaskAsync ExecuteGetTaskAsync ExecutePostTaskAsync Execute ExecuteAsGet ExecuteAsPost DownloadData HttpWebRequest The agent instruments these HttpWebRequest methods: GetResponse Connect the agent to other New Relic products In addition to APM, the agent integrates with other New Relic products to give you end-to-end visibility: Product Integration Browser monitoring For ASP.NET applications, the .NET agent automatically injects the browser JavaScript agent when you enable auto-instrumentation. After enabling browser injection, you can view browser data in the APM Summary page and quickly switch between the APM and browser data for a particular app. For configuration options and manual instrumentation, see Browser monitoring and the .NET agent. Automatic browser injection is not supported for ASP.NET core applications. Infrastructure monitoring When you install the Infrastructure and APM agents on the same host, they automatically detect one another. You can then view a list of hosts in the APM UI, and filter your Infrastructure hosts by APM app in the Infrastructure UI. For more information, see APM data in Infrastructure. Dashboards The .NET agent sends default events and attributes for NRQL queries. You can also record custom events for advanced analysis. Synthetic monitoring Synthetic transaction traces connect requests from Synthetics monitors to the underlying APM transaction.",

      "body": "New Relic's .NET agent supports both .NET Framework and .NET Core. This document describes compatibility and support for .NET Core applications. See Compatibility and requirements for .NET Framework for .NET Framework applications. New Relic's .NET agent includes built-in instrumentation for some of the most popular parts of the .NET Core ecosystem, including frameworks, databases, and message queuing systems. After installation, the agent runs within the monitored process; there is not a separate process or service created by the agent. For frameworks and libraries that are not automatically instrumented out of the box, you can extend the agent with .NET custom instrumentation. Want to try out our .NET agent? Create a New Relic account for free! No credit card required. Requirements Before you install the New Relic .NET agent on Windows or Linux, make sure your system meets these requirements: Microsoft .NET Core version The .NET agent supports .NET Core versions 2.0, 2.1, 2.2, 3.0, 3.1, and .NET 5.0. Table of minimum agent versions required per .NET Core version .NET Core Version Minimum Required .NET Agent Version .NET Core 2.0 > = 8.19.353.0 .NET Core 2.1 > = 8.19.353.0 .NET Core 2.2 > = 8.19.353.0 .NET Core 3.0 > = 8.21.34.0 .NET Core 3.1 > = 8.21.34.0 .NET 5.0 > = 8.35.0 The agent is not compatible with .NET Core versions 1.0 or 1.1. For .NET Core 2.1 or higher applications with tiered compilation enabled, the agent will disable tiered compilation. .NET Core 2.1 support requires .NET Core runtime 2.1.3 and .NET Core SDK 2.1.401 or higher due to a bug in the .NET Core profiling API. Target framework version The .NET agent only supports applications targeting .NET Core 2.0, 2.1, 2.2, 3.0, 3.1, and NET 5.0. You can find the target framework in your .csproj file: Supported: <TargetFramework>netcoreapp2.0</TargetFramework> Copy <TargetFramework>netcoreapp2.1</TargetFramework> Copy <TargetFramework>netcoreapp2.2</TargetFramework> Copy <TargetFramework>netcoreapp3.0</TargetFramework> Copy <TargetFramework>netcoreapp3.1</TargetFramework> Copy <TargetFramework>net5.0</TargetFramework> Copy Unsupported: <TargetFramework>net452</TargetFramework> Copy Important If you want to monitor an ASP.NET Core application targeting .NET Framework, ensure your install of the .NET agent has .NET Framework support enabled. App/web servers Ensure you use one of these app/web servers: Kestrel Kestrel with IIS reverse proxy via AspNetCoreModule Kestrel with IIS reverse proxy via AspNetCoreModuleV2 Kestrel with Nginx reverse proxy Kestrel with Apache reverse proxy Operating system The agent has been verified to work with the following operating systems: Operating system Supported versions Windows (32- and 64-bit Intel compatible architectures) Server 2008 R2 SP1 Server 2012 Server 2012 R2 Server 2016 Server 2019 Windows containers running on Server 2016 (NanoServer based images are not supported) Linux (64-bit Intel compatible only) All x64 Linux distributions supported by the .NET Core 2.0+/.NET 5 runtime are supported by the .NET agent. For a full list, refer to Microsoft's documentation for the version of the runtime you are using. Microsoft Azure For Azure-specific installation instructions, see: Install on Azure Cloud Services Install on Azure Service Fabric Install on Azure Web Apps Processor architectures The agent is available in both 32-bit (x86) and 64-bit (x64) versions on Windows as well as 64-bit (x64) on Linux. Permissions Installing and running the .NET agent requires these permissions: Component Necessary permissions Install the agent The process or user that installs the agent must have sufficient permissions to set environment variables and write access to the directory where the agent is installed. Run the agent The monitored process must have read/write access to the directory in which you installed the agent. The agent runs as a part of the monitored process and relies on those permissions to function. For applications using IIS via reverse proxy, the group IIS_IUSRS is often used. Security requirements As a standard security measure for data collection, your app server must support SHA-2 (256-bit). SHA-1 is not supported. Network requirements The agent requires your firewall to allow outgoing connections to specific networks and ports. Automatic instrumentation If your application is hosted in ASP.NET Core, the agent automatically creates and instruments transactions. The .NET agent will automatically instrument your application after install. If your app is not automatically instrumented, or if you want to add instrumentation, use custom instrumentation. App frameworks The .NET agent automatically instruments these application frameworks: ASP.NET Core MVC 2.0, 2.1, 2.2, 3.0, 3.1, and 5.0 (includes Web API) Datastores The .NET agent automatically instruments the performance of .NET application calls to these datastores: Datastore Instance details Notes Microsoft SQL Server Use System.Data.SqlClient version 4.3.1 or Microsoft.Data.SqlClient. PostgresSQL Use Npgsql 4.0. Prior versions of Npgsql may also be instrumented, but duplicate and/or missing metrics are possible. MongoDB Driver version 2.3.x - 2.13.x: The .NET agent will support instrumenting pre-exising and new API methods in 2.6.x, but not new methods introduced in 2.7.x and higher. MySQL Use MySql.Data version 6.10.4 or later, or use the MySQL Connector StackExchange.Redis The .NET agent does not directly monitor datastore processes. Also, the .NET SQL parameter capture in a query trace does not list parameters for a parameterized query or a stored procedure. Collecting instance details for supported datastores is enabled by default. To request instance-level information from datastores not currently listed, get support at support.newrelic.com. External call libraries The .NET agent automatically instruments these external call libraries : Libraries Supported methods HttpClient The agent instruments these HttpClient methods: SendAsync GetAsync PostAsync PutAsync DeleteAsync GetStringAsync GetStreamAsync GetByteArrayAsync Messaging The agent automatically instruments these message systems: RabbitMQ 5.1.0 or higher: Puts and takes on messages and queue purge. When receiving messages using an IBasicConsumer, the EventingBasicConsumer is the only implementation that is instrumented by the .NET agent. BasicGet is instrumented, but the agent does not support distributed tracing for BasicGet. The following methods are instrumented: IModel.BasicGet IModel.BasicPublish IModel.BasicComsume IModel.QueuePurge EventingBasicConsumer.HandleBasicDeliver Unavailable features The following features are not available for the .NET agent: Memory usage on Linux due to an ongoing .NET Core issue (try using .NET performance metrics to get this information) Automatic brower monitoring script injection (API or manual instrumentation is required) The .NET agent does not support trim self-contained deployments and executables, because the compiler can potentially trim assemblies that the agent depends on. Infinite Tracing is not supported on Alpine Linux due to a GRPC compatibility issue. See this agent issue for more information. Connect the agent to other New Relic products In addition to APM, the .NET agent integrates with other New Relic products to give you end-to-end visibility: Product Integration Browser monitoring The browser monitoring JavaScript agent will not be injected by the .NET agent for ASP.NET core applications. However, you can inject the browser agent by using the .NET agent API or the browser agent's copy/paste method. After enabling browser injection, you can view browser data in the APM Summary page and quickly switch between the APM and browser data for a particular app. For configuration options and manual instrumentation, see browser monitoring and the .NET agent. Infrastructure monitoring When you install the Infrastructure and APM agents on the same host, they automatically detect one another. You can then view a list of hosts in the APM UI, and filter your Infrastructure hosts by APM app in the Infrastructure UI. For more information, see APM data in Infrastructure.

      "body": "Applications are automatically removed from New Relic after 93 days without sending data to our platform. You can also remove an application using the UI, once it has stopped sending data. Key metrics will continue to be available via the New Relic REST API, with the application name remaining reserved. For more information, see Inactive apps in New Relic One and our data retention guidelines. Before attempting to remove an app Before attempting to remove an app monitored by New Relic APM, browser monitoring, or mobile monitoring from the UI, keep in mind: You can downgrade your account to pay less or make it entirely free. The ability to remove an app from the UI may be dependent on permissions. If an agent is still sending data from an app, you cannot remove that app. Remove an application from New Relic Before you can remove an application monitored by New Relic APM, browser monitoring, or mobile monitoring, the app must first stop reporting data. Do this by disabling the agent (explained below) or by uninstalling the agent completely. APM applications Disable an APM agent using these instructions: C SDK: Do a quick recompile and deploy. For example, surround your instrumentation in #ifdef, and set the value of YOURNAMESPACE_NEWRELIC_ENABLED with your build system. Go: Set Enabled to false. Java: Set agent_enabled to false. .NET: Set Newrelic.AgentEnabled to false. Node.js: Set agent_enabled to false. PHP: Remove or disable both the newrelic.so and newrelic-daemon components. Set newrelic.enabled to false. Python: Set monitor_mode to false. Ruby: Set agent_enabled to false. Restart the application server and wait up to ten minutes. Verify the color-coded health status for the app has turned to gray and is no longer reporting data. To remove the APM application from the UI (and any associated apps in browser monitoring), you have a few options: Delete the app from the UI. Go to one.newrelic.com > APM > (select an app/service) > Settings > Application, and click the Delete application button. Use NerdGraph to delete an entity. If you've done the above and are still seeing that app in the UI, you can use NerdGraph to delete the relevant entities. For how to find entity IDs, see Entities. Browser If you've used the copy/paste method to install the browser agent, remove the JavaScript snippet from your application's pages. After 93 days, that app will be removed from the UI. If you want to remove it sooner than that, you have several options: Delete an associated APM app. If your browser app is linked to an APM application, deleting the APM application also removes the browser application. See the instructions for deleting an APM app. Delete it from the UI. Go to one.newrelic.com > Browser > (select an app) > Settings > Application settings, and click the Delete application button. Use NerdGraph to delete an entity. If you've done the above and are still seeing that app in the UI, you can use NerdGraph to delete the relevant entities. For how to find entity IDs, see Entities. Mobile Remove all references/dependencies to New Relic's mobile monitoring SDK/frameworks, then rebuild the application. For more information, see the iOS and Android install docs. After 93 days, the app will be removed from the UI. If you want to remove it sooner than that, you have several options: Remove it using the UI. Go to one.newrelic.com > Mobile > (select an app) > Settings > Application, and click Delete application. Use NerdGraph to delete an entity. If you've done the above and are still seeing that app in the UI, you can use NerdGraph to delete the relevant entities. For how to find entity IDs, see Entities. Troubleshooting If you have problems removing an app, here are some possible causes and suggested solutions: You lack permissions If you don't have relevant permissions, you won't be able to remove an application. You have not waited long enough All app data must stop reporting to New Relic before you can remove that entity from New Relic. In most cases, this takes between 10-15 minutes. In rare cases, it can take a few minutes longer. Not all agents are disabled If you have multiple agents reporting data under the same UI name, then you must make sure you disable or uninstall all of the agents associated with that entity. You have problems removing your PHP app If you have a PHP app and aren't able to remove it from the UI, possible causes include: You have not disabled both components of the PHP agent. You must stop or uninstall both newrelic.so and newrelic-daemon in order to be able to remove a PHP app. For more information, see New Relic daemon processes. You have set up per-directory monitoring of your PHP app, and unexpected PHP data is reporting as the default PHP application in the New Relic UI. To fix this, change the default app name in the PHP agent config. You don't know where the app's data is coming from If you don't know where an app's data is coming from, it may be because the app's name has been changed. When an app name is changed in the UI, it does not change the underlying app name being reported; it only changes how the app name appears in the UI. To see if there is a difference between the reported name and the displayed name: From one.newrelic.com, select APM, then select an application. Scroll down to Settings and select Application. Compare the name in the Application alias field to the name in the Your application still reports as message directly beneath it. To get host information about an app you are not familiar with: From one.newrelic.com, select APM, then select an application. From the summary view, review the Servers list. Once you have identified where app data is coming from, you can remove the app from New Relic. Browser data is still reporting To remove an app from New Relic, all data must have stopped reporting, including browser monitoring data. To verify that you have disabled or uninstalled the APM agent associated with the app: Ensure that browser monitoring is disabled. If your browser monitoring script is inserted by the APM agent, turn it off from inside the UI, in the agent's config file, or in both. If you copied and pasted the monitoring JavaScript snippet in certain pages, remove that JavaScript snippet manually. Ensure all caches have been cleared that the application uses, such as host caches, CDNs, or anything else that caches built pages. Optional: To see a count of how many page views report from each domain, use this NRQL query: SELECT count(*) FROM PageView WHERE appName = 'YOUR_BROWSER_APP_NAME' FACET domain Copy If these steps don't resolve the issue, it is likely due to an end-user's browser cache that hasn't yet cleared. Wait until those caches clear. If your app has internal users, you may be able to identify the users and clear those caches. For more help",

      "body": "Deploying an app can be a risky event—when your app breaks, a bad deployment is often the cause. New Relic allows you to track deployments so you can correlate deploy to your app's performance. Tracking deployments creates deployment markers that appear in APM charts. Options for tracking deployments You can use the New Relic REST API v2 to record new deployments, retrieve a list of past deployments, and delete past deployments on your APM application. In addition, some APM agents have agent-specific methods to record deployments automatically. You can use your Slack integration with New Relic, or a simple webhook, to notify your team in real time of deployments for applications monitored by APM. Slack provides a webhook URL that allows you to post generic JSON that will appear formatted in a chosen Slack channel. There are a few places where you can view deployments in the New Relic UI after they have been recorded. You can view deployments in the UI: In the activity feed of the APM Summary, New Relic One Service summary, and entity summary pages. On APM performance charts as a chart marker. On the Deployments page for summary performance. Tip Deployment markers are not available for browser applications, but see browser releases for a way to tag errors with release versions. Record deployments with the REST API You can use the New Relic REST API v2 to record deployments, get a list of past deployments, and delete deployments. The examples in this document use curl as a command line tool. However, you can use any method to make your REST requests. You can also create, view, and delete deployments with the API Explorer. JSON uses double quotes \" for element names and content. Using single quotes ' will cause errors. Record a deployment with POST To record a new deployment, send a POST request that includes your API key to the deployments endpoint. Attach the payload in JSON format (see Character limits and JSON parameters). All payload parameters are optional except revision. For example: curl -X POST \"https://api.newrelic.com/v2/applications/$APP_ID/deployments.json\" \\ -H \"Api-Key:$API_KEY\" \\ -i \\ -H \"Content-Type: application/json\" \\ -d \\ '{ \"deployment\": { \"revision\": \"REVISION\", \"changelog\": \"Added: /v2/deployments.rb, Removed: None\", \"description\": \"Added a deployments resource to the v2 API\", \"user\": \"datanerd@example.com\", \"timestamp\": \"2019-10-08T00:15:36Z\" } }' Copy Record a deployment with PowerShell To record a deployment with PowerShell, send a POST request that includes your API key to the deployments endpoint. Attach the payload in JSON format (see Character limits and JSON parameters). All payload parameters are optional except revision.

GET requests do not use a JSON payload. For example: curl -X GET \"https://api.newrelic.com/v2/applications/$APP_ID/deployments.json\" \\ -H \"Api-Key:$API_KEY\" \\ -i Copy Sample output from GET This example requests a list of deployments for app ID 9999999: curl -X GET \"https://api.newrelic.com/v2/applications/9999999/deployments.json\" \\ -H \"Api-Key:ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXabcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwx\" \\ -i Copy The API returns this list of deployments: HTTP/1.1 200 OK ETag: \"ABCDEFGHIJKabcdefghijk0123456789\" Cache-Control: max-age=0, private, must-revalidate Content-Type: application/json { \"deployments\": [ { \"id\": 1234567, \"revision\": \"1234123412341234123412341234123412341234\", \"changelog\": \"Fixed the bugs for real this time\", \"description\": \"Example description two\", \"user\": \"Data Nerd\", \"timestamp\": \"2016-02-24T10:09:27-08:00\", \"links\": { \"application\": 9999999 } }, { \"id\": 2345678, \"revision\": \"7890789078907890789078907890789078907890\", \"changelog\": \"Think I fixed all the bugs\", \"description\": null, \"user\": \"Dren Atad\", \"timestamp\": \"2014-10-22T12:23:47-07:00\", \"links\": { \"application\": 9999999 } } ], \"links\": { \"deployment.agent\": \"/v2/applications/{application_id}\" } } Copy Delete a deployment with DELETE To delete a deployment, send a DELETE request that includes your API key to the deployments endpoint. DELETE requests do not use a JSON payload, but you must specify the ID for the deployment you want to delete. To retrieve the ID for a deployment, use the GET request. For example: curl -X DELETE \"https://api.newrelic.com/v2/applications/$APP_ID/deployments/$DEPLOYMENT_ID.json\" \\ -H \"Api-Key:$API_KEY\" \\ -i Copy Character limits and JSON parameters The JSON payload can include the following parameters. Important UTF-8 4 byte characters, such as Emojis and some non-Latin language glyphs, cannot be used in the deployment text. Parameter Data type Description revision String, 127 character maximum Required. A unique ID for this deployment, visible in the Summary page and on the Deployments page. Can be any string, but is usually a version number or a Git checksum. changelog String, 65535 character maximum Optional. A summary of what changed in this deployment, visible in the Deployments page when you select (selected deployment) > Change log. description String, 65535 character maximum Optional. A high-level description of this deployment, visible in the Summary page and on the Deployments page when you select an individual deployment. user String, 31 character maximum Optional. A username to associate with the deployment, visible in the Summary page and on the Deployments page. timestamp ISO 8601 Optional. When the deployment occurred, down to the second. If not specified, the deployment will be recorded at the time when the API call was received. Timestamp requirements: Must be in UTC time. Must be after the most recent deployment timestamp. Cannot be in the future. Must be in ISO8601 format; for example, \"2019-10-08T00:15:36Z\". Record deployments using the New Relic agent Some agents have additional methods to record deployments: All agents: Use the New Relic REST API v2. C: No SDK-specific methods. Use the REST API. Go: No agent-specific methods. Use the REST API. Java: Call the Java agent jar. .NET: Use PowerShell and the REST API. Node.js: No agent-specific methods. Use the REST API. PHP: Use a PHP script. Python: Use the record-deploy subcommand of the newrelic-admin script. Ruby: Use a Capistrano recipe. Notify your team of deployments After a deployment is recorded using the REST API, you can optionally notify a webhook endpoint of the deployment. The destination of the webhook can be your Slack instance. To use webhooks to set up a deployment notification for a Slack channel: Log in to your Slack account as an admin, then go to App directory > Manage > Apps. Search for your New Relic app, then select Add configuration. From Post to channel, select an existing Slack channel or add a new channel, then Add configuration. From the list of options, copy the webhook URL. Go to one.newrelic.com > (account dropdown) > Account settings > Integrations > Deploy notifications > Webhook. Paste the Slack webhook URL, then save. Optional: Send a test message. Tip You can also use webhooks, Slack channels, and other options for alert notifications with New Relic Alerts. End of life notification: Hipchat, Campfire As of September 9, 2019, integrations with Hipchat and Campfire for APM deployment notifications will no longer be available. Recommendation: If you are still using Hipchat or Campfire, use webhooks with Slack channels instead. For more information, see the New Relic Explorers Hub post.",

Customer risk management All New Relic services are intended to be covered by our compliance programs. However, a new service may not be covered by one or more of our compliance programs at any given time throughout the year. This is primarily dependent on the timing when the service achieved General Availability (GA) status and the timing of the specific compliance program's annual authorization, certification, or assessment. You can use any New Relic service regardless of its compliance program status. However, if a service is not yet in scope of our compliance programs, we encourage you to consider your risk appetite in the decision to use the specific New Relic product or service. If you choose to use New Relic services that are not yet in our compliance program scope, you assume the responsibility to review, understand, and risk-manage your security controls as you deem appropriate. You also have the option to wait for New Relic to authorize these services before you use them.",

      "body": "Applications are automatically removed from New Relic after 93 days without sending data to our platform. You can also remove an application using the UI, once it has stopped sending data. Key metrics will continue to be available via the New Relic REST API, with the application name remaining reserved. For more information, see Inactive apps in New Relic One and our data retention guidelines. Before attempting to remove an app Before attempting to remove an app monitored by New Relic APM, browser monitoring, or mobile monitoring from the UI, keep in mind: You can downgrade your account to pay less or make it entirely free. The ability to remove an app from the UI may be dependent on permissions. If an agent is still sending data from an app, you cannot remove that app. Remove an application from New Relic Before you can remove an application monitored by New Relic APM, browser monitoring, or mobile monitoring, the app must first stop reporting data. Do this by disabling the agent (explained below) or by uninstalling the agent completely. APM applications Disable an APM agent using these instructions: C SDK: Do a quick recompile and deploy. For example, surround your instrumentation in #ifdef, and set the value of YOURNAMESPACE_NEWRELIC_ENABLED with your build system. Go: Set Enabled to false. Java: Set agent_enabled to false. .NET: Set Newrelic.AgentEnabled to false. Node.js: Set agent_enabled to false. PHP: Remove or disable both the newrelic.so and newrelic-daemon components. Set newrelic.enabled to false. Python: Set monitor_mode to false. Ruby: Set agent_enabled to false. Restart the application server and wait up to ten minutes. Verify the color-coded health status for the app has turned to gray and is no longer reporting data. To remove the APM application from the UI (and any associated apps in browser monitoring), you have a few options: Delete the app from the UI. Go to one.newrelic.com > APM > (select an app/service) > Settings > Application, and click the Delete application button. Use NerdGraph to delete an entity. If you've done the above and are still seeing that app in the UI, you can use NerdGraph to delete the relevant entities. For how to find entity IDs, see Entities. Browser If you've used the copy/paste method to install the browser agent, remove the JavaScript snippet from your application's pages. After 93 days, that app will be removed from the UI. If you want to remove it sooner than that, you have several options: Delete an associated APM app. If your browser app is linked to an APM application, deleting the APM application also removes the browser application. See the instructions for deleting an APM app. Delete it from the UI. Go to one.newrelic.com > Browser > (select an app) > Settings > Application settings, and click the Delete application button. Use NerdGraph to delete an entity. If you've done the above and are still seeing that app in the UI, you can use NerdGraph to delete the relevant entities. For how to find entity IDs, see Entities. Mobile Remove all references/dependencies to New Relic's mobile monitoring SDK/frameworks, then rebuild the application. For more information, see the iOS and Android install docs. After 93 days, the app will be removed from the UI. If you want to remove it sooner than that, you have several options: Remove it using the UI. Go to one.newrelic.com > Mobile > (select an app) > Settings > Application, and click Delete application. Use NerdGraph to delete an entity. If you've done the above and are still seeing that app in the UI, you can use NerdGraph to delete the relevant entities. For how to find entity IDs, see Entities. Troubleshooting If you have problems removing an app, here are some possible causes and suggested solutions: You lack permissions If you don't have relevant permissions, you won't be able to remove an application. You have not waited long enough All app data must stop reporting to New Relic before you can remove that entity from New Relic. In most cases, this takes between 10-15 minutes. In rare cases, it can take a few minutes longer. Not all agents are disabled If you have multiple agents reporting data under the same UI name, then you must make sure you disable or uninstall all of the agents associated with that entity. You have problems removing your PHP app If you have a PHP app and aren't able to remove it from the UI, possible causes include: You have not disabled both components of the PHP agent. You must stop or uninstall both newrelic.so and newrelic-daemon in order to be able to remove a PHP app. For more information, see New Relic daemon processes. You have set up per-directory monitoring of your PHP app, and unexpected PHP data is reporting as the default PHP application in the New Relic UI. To fix this, change the default app name in the PHP agent config. You don't know where the app's data is coming from If you don't know where an app's data is coming from, it may be because the app's name has been changed. When an app name is changed in the UI, it does not change the underlying app name being reported; it only changes how the app name appears in the UI. To see if there is a difference between the reported name and the displayed name: From one.newrelic.com, select APM, then select an application. Scroll down to Settings and select Application. Compare the name in the Application alias field to the name in the Your application still reports as message directly beneath it. To get host information about an app you are not familiar with: From one.newrelic.com, select APM, then select an application. From the summary view, review the Servers list. Once you have identified where app data is coming from, you can remove the app from New Relic. Browser data is still reporting To remove an app from New Relic, all data must have stopped reporting, including browser monitoring data. To verify that you have disabled or uninstalled the APM agent associated with the app: Ensure that browser monitoring is disabled. If your browser monitoring script is inserted by the APM agent, turn it off from inside the UI, in the agent's config file, or in both. If you copied and pasted the monitoring JavaScript snippet in certain pages, remove that JavaScript snippet manually. Ensure all caches have been cleared that the application uses, such as host caches, CDNs, or anything else that caches built pages. Optional: To see a count of how many page views report from each domain, use this NRQL query: SELECT count(*) FROM PageView WHERE appName = 'YOUR_BROWSER_APP_NAME' FACET domain Copy If these steps don't resolve the issue, it is likely due to an end-user's browser cache that hasn't yet cleared. Wait until those caches clear. If your app has internal users, you may be able to identify the users and clear those caches. For more help",

Related procedures: To permanently disable APM, uninstall the agent. To configure an agent to monitor some things but not others, use custom instrumentation. Disable the APM agent Select your agent type for instructions: C SDK The C SDK cannot be turned on or off directly. However, you can write your code for the SDK so that a quick recompile and deploy can enable or disable your instrumentation. Follow standard procedures to disable or uninstall the C SDK. Go There are two main ways to disable the Go agent: Remove the import of the github.com/newrelic/go-agent package from your application, and remove or comment out any calls to the newrelic namespace. Then, recompile and restart your app. Use the enabled configuration setting. Then, recompile and restart your app. (This will not reduce overhead because the instrumentation is still running; it will only prevent the sending of data to the New Relic collector.) Tip After you disable the agent, it may take several minutes for data to stop showing up. Java There are three main ways to disable the Java agent: Set agent_enabled to false, then restart the JVM. Use the JVM command line flag: -Dnewrelic.config.agent_enabled=false Copy Then restart the JVM. Remove the newrelic.jar or newrelic.yml file, then restart the JVM. Tip After you disable the agent, it may take several minutes for data to stop showing up. .NET The method to disable the agent depends on if you are using Framework or Core: .NET Framework: Set agentEnabled to false in the global newrelic.config file, found in C:\\ProgramData\\New Relic\\.NET Agent\\. If the application is IIS-hosted, restart IIS. If it's self-hosted (non-IIS), restart the application. .NET Core: Set agentEnabled to false in the newrelic.config file found in the Core agent’s installation directory (for Windows alongside NewRelic.Profiler.dll and for Linux alongside NewRelic.Profiler.so). If you use the ASP.NET Core Module, reset IIS. Otherwise, restart your Core application. Tip After you disable the agent, it may take several minutes for data to stop showing up. Node.js There are two main ways to disable the Node.js agent: Set agent_enabled to false in your agent config file, then restart the app server. Set the NEW_RELIC_ENABLED environment variable to false. Tip After you disable the agent, it may take several minutes for data to stop showing up. PHP To disable the PHP agent, set the enabled config setting to false, then restart the web server or PHP. Tip After you disable the agent, it may take several minutes for data to stop showing up. Python There are three main ways to disable the Python agent, depending on your preference and setup: Standard install: Use the monitor_mode configuration setting. This can be done by editing the config file or by using an environment variable. Standard install with newrelic-admin script: Remove reference to that script in your application. Manual instrumentation: Remove the initialization script from your application. Tip After you disable the agent, it may take several minutes for data to stop showing up. Ruby There are several ways to disable the Ruby agent, depending on your preference and setup. These methods will remove most instrumentation but there will still be a small amount of activity and overhead: Use the agent_enabled configuration setting. This can be done in the configuration file or in the per-environment stanzas. Restart your app server afterward. Do the same via an environment variable, then restart the app server. The following methods will remove all instrumentation and overhead: Remove newrelic_rpm from the Gemfile and bundle install. Set the following in the Gemfile and bundle install: gem 'newrelic_rpm', :require => false Copy This option ensures the gem is installed if it's required somewhere in the app, but doesn't install it when bundling.

      "body": "Deploying an app can be a risky event—when your app breaks, a bad deployment is often the cause. New Relic allows you to track deployments so you can correlate deploy to your app's performance. Tracking deployments creates deployment markers that appear in APM charts. Options for tracking deployments You can use the New Relic REST API v2 to record new deployments, retrieve a list of past deployments, and delete past deployments on your APM application. In addition, some APM agents have agent-specific methods to record deployments automatically. You can use your Slack integration with New Relic, or a simple webhook, to notify your team in real time of deployments for applications monitored by APM. Slack provides a webhook URL that allows you to post generic JSON that will appear formatted in a chosen Slack channel. There are a few places where you can view deployments in the New Relic UI after they have been recorded. You can view deployments in the UI: In the activity feed of the APM Summary, New Relic One Service summary, and entity summary pages. On APM performance charts as a chart marker. On the Deployments page for summary performance. Tip Deployment markers are not available for browser applications, but see browser releases for a way to tag errors with release versions. Record deployments with the REST API You can use the New Relic REST API v2 to record deployments, get a list of past deployments, and delete deployments. The examples in this document use curl as a command line tool. However, you can use any method to make your REST requests. You can also create, view, and delete deployments with the API Explorer. JSON uses double quotes \" for element names and content. Using single quotes ' will cause errors. Record a deployment with POST To record a new deployment, send a POST request that includes your API key to the deployments endpoint. Attach the payload in JSON format (see Character limits and JSON parameters). All payload parameters are optional except revision. For example: curl -X POST \"https://api.newrelic.com/v2/applications/$APP_ID/deployments.json\" \\ -H \"Api-Key:$API_KEY\" \\ -i \\ -H \"Content-Type: application/json\" \\ -d \\ '{ \"deployment\": { \"revision\": \"REVISION\", \"changelog\": \"Added: /v2/deployments.rb, Removed: None\", \"description\": \"Added a deployments resource to the v2 API\", \"user\": \"datanerd@example.com\", \"timestamp\": \"2019-10-08T00:15:36Z\" } }' Copy Record a deployment with PowerShell To record a deployment with PowerShell, send a POST request that includes your API key to the deployments endpoint. Attach the payload in JSON format (see Character limits and JSON parameters). All payload parameters are optional except revision. This example uses PowerShell version 3 or higher: Invoke-WebRequest -Uri https://api.newrelic.com/v2/applications/YOUR_APP_ID/deployments.json -Method POST -Headers @{'Api-Key'='$API_KEY'} -ContentType 'application/json' -Body '{ \"deployment\": { \"revision\": \"REVISION\", \"changelog\": \"Added: /v2/deployments.rb, Removed: None\", \"description\": \"Added a deployments resource to the v2 API\", \"user\": \"datanerd@example.com\", \"timestamp\": \"2019-10-08T00:15:36Z\" } }' Copy This example uses PowerShell version 2 (requires .NET framework 3.5 or higher): $encoding = [System.Text.Encoding]::GetEncoding(\"ASCII\") $data ='{ \"deployment\": { \"revision\": \"REVISION\", \"changelog\": \"Added: /v2/deployments.rb, Removed: None\", \"description\": \"Added a deployments resource to the v2 API\", \"user\": \"datanerd@example.com\", \"timestamp\": \"2019-10-08T00:15:36Z\" } }' $postData = $encoding.GetBytes($data) $request = [System.Net.WebRequest]::Create('https://api.newrelic.com/v2/applications/$APP_ID/deployments.json') $request.Method = 'POST' $request.Headers.add('Api-Key','$API_KEY') $request.ContentType='application/json' $stream = $request.GetRequestStream() $stream.Write($postData,0,$postData.Length) $request.GetResponse() Copy View a list of deployments with GET To retrieve a list of all past deployments for your app, send a GET request that includes your API key to the deployments endpoint. GET requests do not use a JSON payload. For example: curl -X GET \"https://api.newrelic.com/v2/applications/$APP_ID/deployments.json\" \\ -H \"Api-Key:$API_KEY\" \\ -i Copy Sample output from GET This example requests a list of deployments for app ID 9999999: curl -X GET \"https://api.newrelic.com/v2/applications/9999999/deployments.json\" \\ -H \"Api-Key:ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXabcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwx\" \\ -i Copy The API returns this list of deployments: HTTP/1.1 200 OK ETag: \"ABCDEFGHIJKabcdefghijk0123456789\" Cache-Control: max-age=0, private, must-revalidate Content-Type: application/json { \"deployments\": [ { \"id\": 1234567, \"revision\": \"1234123412341234123412341234123412341234\", \"changelog\": \"Fixed the bugs for real this time\", \"description\": \"Example description two\", \"user\": \"Data Nerd\", \"timestamp\": \"2016-02-24T10:09:27-08:00\", \"links\": { \"application\": 9999999 } }, { \"id\": 2345678, \"revision\": \"7890789078907890789078907890789078907890\", \"changelog\": \"Think I fixed all the bugs\", \"description\": null, \"user\": \"Dren Atad\", \"timestamp\": \"2014-10-22T12:23:47-07:00\", \"links\": { \"application\": 9999999 } } ], \"links\": { \"deployment.agent\": \"/v2/applications/{application_id}\" } } Copy Delete a deployment with DELETE To delete a deployment, send a DELETE request that includes your API key to the deployments endpoint. DELETE requests do not use a JSON payload, but you must specify the ID for the deployment you want to delete. To retrieve the ID for a deployment, use the GET request. For example: curl -X DELETE \"https://api.newrelic.com/v2/applications/$APP_ID/deployments/$DEPLOYMENT_ID.json\" \\ -H \"Api-Key:$API_KEY\" \\ -i Copy Character limits and JSON parameters The JSON payload can include the following parameters. Important UTF-8 4 byte characters, such as Emojis and some non-Latin language glyphs, cannot be used in the deployment text. Parameter Data type Description revision String, 127 character maximum Required. A unique ID for this deployment, visible in the Summary page and on the Deployments page. Can be any string, but is usually a version number or a Git checksum. changelog String, 65535 character maximum Optional. A summary of what changed in this deployment, visible in the Deployments page when you select (selected deployment) > Change log. description String, 65535 character maximum Optional. A high-level description of this deployment, visible in the Summary page and on the Deployments page when you select an individual deployment. user String, 31 character maximum Optional. A username to associate with the deployment, visible in the Summary page and on the Deployments page. timestamp ISO 8601 Optional. When the deployment occurred, down to the second. If not specified, the deployment will be recorded at the time when the API call was received. Timestamp requirements: Must be in UTC time. Must be after the most recent deployment timestamp. Cannot be in the future. Must be in ISO8601 format; for example, \"2019-10-08T00:15:36Z\". Record deployments using the New Relic agent Some agents have additional methods to record deployments: All agents: Use the New Relic REST API v2. C: No SDK-specific methods. Use the REST API. Go: No agent-specific methods. Use the REST API. Java: Call the Java agent jar. .NET: Use PowerShell and the REST API. Node.js: No agent-specific methods. Use the REST API. PHP: Use a PHP script. Python: Use the record-deploy subcommand of the newrelic-admin script. Ruby: Use a Capistrano recipe. Notify your team of deployments After a deployment is recorded using the REST API, you can optionally notify a webhook endpoint of the deployment. The destination of the webhook can be your Slack instance. To use webhooks to set up a deployment notification for a Slack channel: Log in to your Slack account as an admin, then go to App directory > Manage > Apps. Search for your New Relic app, then select Add configuration. From Post to channel, select an existing Slack channel or add a new channel, then Add configuration. From the list of options, copy the webhook URL. Go to one.newrelic.com > (account dropdown) > Account settings > Integrations > Deploy notifications > Webhook. Paste the Slack webhook URL, then save. Optional: Send a test message. Tip You can also use webhooks, Slack channels, and other options for alert notifications with New Relic Alerts. End of life notification: Hipchat, Campfire As of September 9, 2019, integrations with Hipchat and Campfire for APM deployment notifications will no longer be available. Recommendation: If you are still using Hipchat or Campfire, use webhooks with Slack channels instead. For more information, see the New Relic Explorers Hub post.",

      "body": "You may want to temporarily disable an APM agent for the purposes of testing or troubleshooting. This document explains procedures for temporarily turning off the APM agent. Related procedures: To permanently disable APM, uninstall the agent. To configure an agent to monitor some things but not others, use custom instrumentation. Disable the APM agent Select your agent type for instructions: C SDK The C SDK cannot be turned on or off directly. However, you can write your code for the SDK so that a quick recompile and deploy can enable or disable your instrumentation. Follow standard procedures to disable or uninstall the C SDK. Go There are two main ways to disable the Go agent: Remove the import of the github.com/newrelic/go-agent package from your application, and remove or comment out any calls to the newrelic namespace. Then, recompile and restart your app. Use the enabled configuration setting. Then, recompile and restart your app. (This will not reduce overhead because the instrumentation is still running; it will only prevent the sending of data to the New Relic collector.) Tip After you disable the agent, it may take several minutes for data to stop showing up. Java There are three main ways to disable the Java agent: Set agent_enabled to false, then restart the JVM. Use the JVM command line flag: -Dnewrelic.config.agent_enabled=false Copy Then restart the JVM. Remove the newrelic.jar or newrelic.yml file, then restart the JVM. Tip After you disable the agent, it may take several minutes for data to stop showing up. .NET The method to disable the agent depends on if you are using Framework or Core: .NET Framework: Set agentEnabled to false in the global newrelic.config file, found in C:\\ProgramData\\New Relic\\.NET Agent\\. If the application is IIS-hosted, restart IIS. If it's self-hosted (non-IIS), restart the application. .NET Core: Set agentEnabled to false in the newrelic.config file found in the Core agent’s installation directory (for Windows alongside NewRelic.Profiler.dll and for Linux alongside NewRelic.Profiler.so). If you use the ASP.NET Core Module, reset IIS. Otherwise, restart your Core application. Tip After you disable the agent, it may take several minutes for data to stop showing up. Node.js There are two main ways to disable the Node.js agent: Set agent_enabled to false in your agent config file, then restart the app server. Set the NEW_RELIC_ENABLED environment variable to false. Tip After you disable the agent, it may take several minutes for data to stop showing up. PHP To disable the PHP agent, set the enabled config setting to false, then restart the web server or PHP. Tip After you disable the agent, it may take several minutes for data to stop showing up. Python There are three main ways to disable the Python agent, depending on your preference and setup: Standard install: Use the monitor_mode configuration setting. This can be done by editing the config file or by using an environment variable. Standard install with newrelic-admin script: Remove reference to that script in your application. Manual instrumentation: Remove the initialization script from your application. Tip After you disable the agent, it may take several minutes for data to stop showing up. Ruby There are several ways to disable the Ruby agent, depending on your preference and setup. These methods will remove most instrumentation but there will still be a small amount of activity and overhead: Use the agent_enabled configuration setting. This can be done in the configuration file or in the per-environment stanzas. Restart your app server afterward. Do the same via an environment variable, then restart the app server. The following methods will remove all instrumentation and overhead: Remove newrelic_rpm from the Gemfile and bundle install. Set the following in the Gemfile and bundle install: gem 'newrelic_rpm', :require => false Copy This option ensures the gem is installed if it's required somewhere in the app, but doesn't install it when bundling.

With automap, you can pinpoint when and where an issue began by viewing the dependencies that affect your services. Here's an example of where you could start troubleshooting with automap. How it works New Relic automap displays relationships between entities in your architecture. For version 1, the relationships displayed in automap are based on direct calls between services. For example, APM services are represented as vertices (hexagons) and direct calls are represented as edges (lines) on the graph. This shows you how these services depend on one another.

      "body": "Problem CPU percent usage data between APM and infrastructure seems contradictory, or your CPU usage exceeds 100%. Cause CPU usage data for APM is different than CPU usage data for infrastructure. In APM, CPU percent usage measures aggregate usage of all instances of an application or service on a given server. In Infrastructure, CPU percent usage is measured differently depending on if you are viewing CPU usage in relation to hosts, or to processes. APM To view your app's CPU usage: Go to one.newrelic.com > (select an app) and see the CPU usage in the hosts list. The number of instances is listed under each host name (for example, 55 instances). APM CPU percent usage measures aggregate CPU usage of all instances of your app or service on a given server. This percentage is affected by the number of instances running across cores on the server. Multiple instances of a service running on one server or in a multi-core environment can produce CPU usage percentages well above 100%. APM calculates the percentage by aggregating CPU time and dividing by clock time: CPU usage = (instance CPU time + instance CPU time + [...]) / (clock time) Copy Example: Upgrading to a quad core processor If you upgrade from a dual processor to a quad processor under the same architecture, you should see roughly the same CPU numbers for the same loads and applications. If New Relic normalized the calculation, the upgrade would appear to produce an abrupt decrease in your CPU usage, even if the number of cycles you are using would be the same. Adding more instances does not make your code more efficient. New Relic Infrastructure To view your individual host CPU usage: Go to one.newrelic.com > Infrastructure and see CPU %. See individual CPU usage in the hosts list. The exact calculation for CPU usage is measured differently depending on if you are viewing CPU usage in relation to hosts, or to processes: Page Calculation details Hosts On the Hosts page, CPU Percent is a derived metric that is part of the SystemSample event. The CPU percentage is not collected by New Relic, but derived from several other metrics. Specifically, the cpuPercent attribute is an aggregation of cpuUserPercent, cpuSystemPercent, cpuIoWaitPercent and cpuStealPercent. The Hosts page shows metrics from a perspective of your whole system. For example, if a server has 32 cores installed and is showing cpuPercent of 50%, 16 of the 32 cores are being used. Processes On the Processes page, CPU percent is scoped to individual processes, rather than hosts. Because of this, the CPU percent metric does not take into account the resources of the entire system. Instead, it shows how much of a single CPU core each process is taking. For example, with a 32-core server, a process showing cpuPercent of 50% is only taking half of a single core, or about 1.5625% of the CPU cycles available on the whole server. This can result in cpuPercent exceeding 100% on the Processes page. When this occurs, the process is demanding more than a single core’s worth of CPU cycles.",

If you do not see this APM-infrastructure linkage, follow these troubleshooting tips. Solution If you completed the APM/Infrastructure integration but do not see APM data in infrastructure, try these troubleshooting procedures. Restart the app server. If you have not restarted your APM-monitored application in a few weeks or months, the data streams from Infrastructure and APM may not be linked. Restart your app server. Generate some traffic for your app. Wait a few minutes, and then check for APM data in infrastructure monitoring. Make sure the hostnames are the same in APM and Infrastructure. If the hostnames are different in APM and infrastructure monitoring, New Relic cannot integrate the data. One common cause for this issue is that the default hostnames are different. For example, infrastructure monitoring uses a host's FQDN (such as myhost1.example.com), while APM uses the host's name (such as myhost1). Go to one[.newrelic.com](http://one.newrelic.com) > APM > (select an app). From the app's APM Overview page, look at the app's associated host name. Compare that name with the same host's name in infrastructure monitoring. If the names are different, either set the APM agent host's display_name to match its FQDN, or set the host's display_name in Infrastructure to match the one set in APM. Check for replacement host FQDN recognition problems. If the APM-Infrastructure integration previously worked but has stopped, the server may have been replaced by another server that has the same FQDN. If both servers existed simultaneously for a period of time, New Relic cannot automatically recognize the new server. That will break the connection between APM and infrastructure data. To solve this problem, get help at support.newrelic.com. To prevent this problem, make sure there is a time gap between taking down an old server going down and creating a new server.",

      "body": "Problem CPU percent usage data between APM and infrastructure seems contradictory, or your CPU usage exceeds 100%. Cause CPU usage data for APM is different than CPU usage data for infrastructure. In APM, CPU percent usage measures aggregate usage of all instances of an application or service on a given server. In Infrastructure, CPU percent usage is measured differently depending on if you are viewing CPU usage in relation to hosts, or to processes. APM To view your app's CPU usage: Go to one.newrelic.com > (select an app) and see the CPU usage in the hosts list. The number of instances is listed under each host name (for example, 55 instances). APM CPU percent usage measures aggregate CPU usage of all instances of your app or service on a given server. This percentage is affected by the number of instances running across cores on the server. Multiple instances of a service running on one server or in a multi-core environment can produce CPU usage percentages well above 100%. APM calculates the percentage by aggregating CPU time and dividing by clock time: CPU usage = (instance CPU time + instance CPU time + [...]) / (clock time) Copy Example: Upgrading to a quad core processor If you upgrade from a dual processor to a quad processor under the same architecture, you should see roughly the same CPU numbers for the same loads and applications. If New Relic normalized the calculation, the upgrade would appear to produce an abrupt decrease in your CPU usage, even if the number of cycles you are using would be the same. Adding more instances does not make your code more efficient. New Relic Infrastructure To view your individual host CPU usage: Go to one.newrelic.com > Infrastructure and see CPU %. See individual CPU usage in the hosts list. The exact calculation for CPU usage is measured differently depending on if you are viewing CPU usage in relation to hosts, or to processes: Page Calculation details Hosts On the Hosts page, CPU Percent is a derived metric that is part of the SystemSample event. The CPU percentage is not collected by New Relic, but derived from several other metrics. Specifically, the cpuPercent attribute is an aggregation of cpuUserPercent, cpuSystemPercent, cpuIoWaitPercent and cpuStealPercent. The Hosts page shows metrics from a perspective of your whole system. For example, if a server has 32 cores installed and is showing cpuPercent of 50%, 16 of the 32 cores are being used. Processes On the Processes page, CPU percent is scoped to individual processes, rather than hosts. Because of this, the CPU percent metric does not take into account the resources of the entire system. Instead, it shows how much of a single CPU core each process is taking. For example, with a 32-core server, a process showing cpuPercent of 50% is only taking half of a single core, or about 1.5625% of the CPU cycles available on the whole server. This can result in cpuPercent exceeding 100% on the Processes page. When this occurs, the process is demanding more than a single core’s worth of CPU cycles.",

      "body": "Problem When APM and infrastructure agents are installed on the same hosts and use the same New Relic license key, APM data should appear in infrastructure, and vice versa. If you do not see this APM-infrastructure linkage, follow these troubleshooting tips. Solution If you completed the APM/Infrastructure integration but do not see APM data in infrastructure, try these troubleshooting procedures. Restart the app server. If you have not restarted your APM-monitored application in a few weeks or months, the data streams from Infrastructure and APM may not be linked. Restart your app server. Generate some traffic for your app. Wait a few minutes, and then check for APM data in infrastructure monitoring. Make sure the hostnames are the same in APM and Infrastructure. If the hostnames are different in APM and infrastructure monitoring, New Relic cannot integrate the data. One common cause for this issue is that the default hostnames are different. For example, infrastructure monitoring uses a host's FQDN (such as myhost1.example.com), while APM uses the host's name (such as myhost1). Go to one[.newrelic.com](http://one.newrelic.com) > APM > (select an app). From the app's APM Overview page, look at the app's associated host name. Compare that name with the same host's name in infrastructure monitoring. If the names are different, either set the APM agent host's display_name to match its FQDN, or set the host's display_name in Infrastructure to match the one set in APM. Check for replacement host FQDN recognition problems. If the APM-Infrastructure integration previously worked but has stopped, the server may have been replaced by another server that has the same FQDN. If both servers existed simultaneously for a period of time, New Relic cannot automatically recognize the new server. That will break the connection between APM and infrastructure data. To solve this problem, get help at support.newrelic.com. To prevent this problem, make sure there is a time gap between taking down an old server going down and creating a new server.",

The email report contains summary performance metrics for the past week for a select group of your applications. The weekly performance report is different than APM's Service Level Agreement (SLA) reports. Important At this time, weekly performance reports are not available for accounts in the EU region. View example report details To see an example of a weekly performance report for your account: From the account dropdown, select User preferences. Select Weekly summaries and select See sample email. The performance report is split into sections: Section Description Featured app This provides both throughput pattern and performance metrics for the application with the highest call count in your account. Applications with linked browser monitoring will be prioritized over those that don't, even if the call count is lower. All apps report This section provides important performance metrics for the 20 applications in your account with the highest call count. Metrics in this list include uptime, Apdex, load time, and throughput. Recent events This section contains any recent alerts, deployments you have made to your app, or other events that are recorded for applications in your account. Selected applications New Relic selects the top 20 apps by call count that meet these criteria: The app must have at least 25 requests per minute (rpm) throughput. The app must include web transactions. Applications with linked browser monitoring will be prioritized over those that don't, even if the call count is lower. Opt in or out of report emails To manage your weekly performance report emails, go to one.newrelic.com, click the account dropdown, and select User preferences.

      "body": "In a DevOps world, a deep understanding of customer expectations and your progress in meeting those expectations is vital to providing stability, maintaining goodwill with your users, and increasing business value. With New Relic you can measure the success of your DevOps initiatives and learn how to identify, resolve, and decrease any gaps in your DevOps performance. In this tutorial, you’ll gather key service delivery stakeholders to assess your team's progress against service level objectives (SLOs) and service level agreements (SLAs), while facilitating further optimizations. Prerequisites This tutorial assumes you’ve completed the Establish objectives and baseline tutorial. 1. Assemble a cross-functional team to review service delivery The first (and most important step) is assembling the right team. Identify the proper stakeholders and representatives to play active parts in the operations review process. This team should be comprised of individuals who develop applications, work with service delivery, maintain your ecosystem, and resolve problems for customers. While operations review teams often focus on technical members, the best teams have broad representation across the company, including representatives from Business Operations, Marketing, and Support. These cross-functional teams help ensure that the service delivery process is strongly integrated with customer expectations. If you can specifically identify how technical improvements meet customer expectations and positively impact the business’s bottom line, then your operations team is functioning at optimal levels. Tip Ideally, the cross-functional operations review team should also be the team that defines your SLOs. If this is not possible, try to ensure that some members of the operations review team are also on the team responsible for SLOs. 2. Review service records and note key metrics Create a regular meeting to track your service records. New Relic recommends reviewing your previous service records, and pinpointing specific metrics to analyze at every review. For example, start with application state, alert conditions, and runtime anomalies. Look at the same metrics on two separate occasions to identify and assess patterns, inconsistencies, and anomalies. Monitor these metrics using the service delivery Insights dashboards you created in the Establish objectives and baselines tutorial. The widgets on these dashboards provide a high-level overview of the relationships between different performance indicators and baselines: insights.newrelic.com > (select a dashboard): Use dashboards to visualize metrics related to service delivery. When conducting a thorough performance review, make several dashboards that have corresponding widgets. Use these dashboards to hone-in on two specific time periods that you want to compare. This comparative analysis could cover everything from Infrastructure or browser performance, to Synthetics testing or business impact. To get started with performance indicators in Insights, read the following example queries. These queries provide information that you can consider incorporating for the operations review. Daily uptime SELECT percentage(count(result), where result = 'SUCCESS') from SyntheticCheck since 1 Day ago Copy Create dashboards that are dedicated to the functionality that drives your software development process, such as testing. For example, collect related metrics on uptime, types of monitors, geo-locations, and other data points that are required for appropriately measuring SLAs. The following dashboard provides such an example: insights.newrelic.com > (select a dashboard): Track your relevant SLAs together in one dashboard. Device performance breakdown SELECT count(*) as '# Pages',average(duration) as 'AVG',percentile(duration,50,75) as '%',average(duration - backendDuration) as 'Front',average(backendDuration) as 'Back',average(connectionSetupDuration) as 'Connection',average(domProcessingDuration) as 'DOM Processing',average(pageRenderingDuration) as 'Page Rendering' FROM PageView FACET deviceType LIMIT 3 SINCE 1 day ago Copy Top URL performance SELECT count(*) as '# Pages',average(duration) as 'AVG',percentile(duration,50,75) as '%',average(duration - backendDuration) as 'Front',average(backendDuration) as 'Back',average(connectionSetupDuration) as 'Connection',average(domProcessingDuration) as 'DOM Processing',average(pageRenderingDuration) as 'Page Rendering' FROM PageView facet pageUrl SINCE 1 day ago limit 30 Copy Memory usage SELECT average(memoryUsedBytes) /1000000 AS 'Avg MB Used', average(memoryFreeBytes)/1000000 AS 'Avg MB Free', average(memoryFreeBytes/memoryTotalBytes)*100 as 'Memory used %' FROM SystemSample since 30 minutes ago Copy Server CPU SELECT average(cpuPercent) FROM SystemSample since 3 hours ago facet hostname limit 400 Copy Combine the results into a single dashboard to help drive decisions during your operations review. Dashboards that give a brief overview of performance across your entire application stack are invaluable for cross-functional team reviews. Tip Beyond Insights, the APM reports allow you to see how you’re performing on a daily, weekly, and monthly basis with built in SLA reports and other detailed reports. The out-of-the-box details from these reports give your operations team a launch pad for conversations about progress against objectives and overall performance. 3. Summarize events related to application alerts, downtime, and errors Now that you’ve gathered data about your service delivery, the next step is to dive deeper into specific incidents that warrant further investigation or surface a need for broader team action. For example, notable downtime and errors are key areas to investigate as a team. After completing the Setup proactive alerting tutorial, you can explore notifications of violations as they occur. Once these violations are brought to your attention, acknowledge the specific incident and have an ongoing record of both opened and closed incidents. Use the incident reports as a focal point for discussion of gaps. alerts.newrelic.com > Incidents: Identify performance issues and SLA gaps with New Relic Alerts incident reports. Ultimately, it’s important to solicit feedback from the cross-functional team on the causes of the incidents to determine how you can improve service delivery processes to prevent reoccurrences. One approach might be to focus on one or two notable incidents, use the New Relic UI to walk through the data points leading up to those incidents, and assess the actions that occurred. Summarize the incident and the cross-functional feedback on causes and potential solutions as succinctly as possible. Over time, you’ll notice patterns that will require deeper action. 4. Create follow-up tracking tickets With built-in or customizable integrations with ServiceNow and other common ticketing systems, New Relic helps you follow up on anomalies and performance shortfalls as they arise. Add the information provided by New Relic to the tracking system, and ensure that the team charged with solving the problem has all of the details they need to track down and resolve the issue.",

SLA tips Comments Requirements When using the cURL command examples, be sure to replace the placeholder text with your account ID, an API key, and the application ID. Time ranges You are not limited to standard day, week, or month time ranges. For example, you can extract metric data for a \"holiday weekend\" from 12/23 to 12/26 or \"the 20 minutes after our site had problems\" or whatever other period interests you. UTC XML time format You must specify the time in UTC XML format, so be sure to adjust for your time zone compared to UTC. For example, New Relic starts at 16:00:00 on the day before the selected data, since New Relic headquarters are in UTC-8. Summary reports When requesting metrics to use with summary reports, include the query string parameter summarize=true (v2) or summary=1 (v1) as shown in the examples. Scaled statistics Your report has some statistics that are scaled in the SLA reports in New Relic's user interface. New Relic changes the scale of page views in your report to show small numbers. Depending on your traffic, typically it might be displayed in thousands, millions, or billions. Recommendation: To avoid a string of zeroes, divide this number appropriately for your own purposes. End user statistics End user statistics will reflect only the calls in which the agent gathered browser data. For example, end user stats may not appear in situations such as: Browser types Clients (they might have disabled the JavaScript agent, or blocked traffic to New Relic sites for JavaScript code's location Transactions not in one of those categories, in case the page load did not complete for any reason This is why there are fewer (sometimes many fewer) page views in the End User (browser) data section than in the App server data section. Examples The following sections contain code examples to acquire the data for values described above for the Daily (24hr) SLA statistics in the default GMT/UTC time zone. Adjust the from= and to= for your time range as desired. There are syntactical differences between New Relic's REST API v2 and v1. The examples show how to use each.

With New Relic you can measure the success of your DevOps initiatives and learn how to identify, resolve, and decrease any gaps in your DevOps performance. In this tutorial, you’ll gather key service delivery stakeholders to assess your team's progress against service level objectives (SLOs) and service level agreements (SLAs), while facilitating further optimizations. Prerequisites This tutorial assumes you’ve completed the Establish objectives and baseline tutorial. 1. Assemble a cross-functional team to review service delivery The first (and most important step) is assembling the right team. Identify the proper stakeholders and representatives to play active parts in the operations review process. This team should be comprised of individuals who develop applications, work with service delivery, maintain your ecosystem, and resolve problems for customers. While operations review teams often focus on technical members, the best teams have broad representation across the company, including representatives from Business Operations, Marketing, and Support. These cross-functional teams help ensure that the service delivery process is strongly integrated with customer expectations. If you can specifically identify how technical improvements meet customer expectations and positively impact the business’s bottom line, then your operations team is functioning at optimal levels. Tip Ideally, the cross-functional operations review team should also be the team that defines your SLOs. If this is not possible, try to ensure that some members of the operations review team are also on the team responsible for SLOs. 2. Review service records and note key metrics Create a regular meeting to track your service records. New Relic recommends reviewing your previous service records, and pinpointing specific metrics to analyze at every review. For example, start with application state, alert conditions, and runtime anomalies. Look at the same metrics on two separate occasions to identify and assess patterns, inconsistencies, and anomalies. Monitor these metrics using the service delivery Insights dashboards you created in the Establish objectives and baselines tutorial. The widgets on these dashboards provide a high-level overview of the relationships between different performance indicators and baselines: insights.newrelic.com > (select a dashboard): Use dashboards to visualize metrics related to service delivery. When conducting a thorough performance review, make several dashboards that have corresponding widgets. Use these dashboards to hone-in on two specific time periods that you want to compare. This comparative analysis could cover everything from Infrastructure or browser performance, to Synthetics testing or business impact. To get started with performance indicators in Insights, read the following example queries. These queries provide information that you can consider incorporating for the operations review. Daily uptime SELECT percentage(count(result), where result = 'SUCCESS') from SyntheticCheck since 1 Day ago Copy Create dashboards that are dedicated to the functionality that drives your software development process, such as testing. For example, collect related metrics on uptime, types of monitors, geo-locations, and other data points that are required for appropriately measuring SLAs. The following dashboard provides such an example: insights.newrelic.com > (select a dashboard): Track your relevant SLAs together in one dashboard.

Dashboards that give a brief overview of performance across your entire application stack are invaluable for cross-functional team reviews. Tip Beyond Insights, the APM reports allow you to see how you’re performing on a daily, weekly, and monthly basis with built in SLA reports and other detailed reports. The out-of-the-box details from these reports give your operations team a launch pad for conversations about progress against objectives and overall performance. 3. Summarize events related to application alerts, downtime, and errors Now that you’ve gathered data about your service delivery, the next step is to dive deeper into specific incidents that warrant further investigation or surface a need for broader team action. For example, notable downtime and errors are key areas to investigate as a team. After completing the Setup proactive alerting tutorial, you can explore notifications of violations as they occur. Once these violations are brought to your attention, acknowledge the specific incident and have an ongoing record of both opened and closed incidents. Use the incident reports as a focal point for discussion of gaps. alerts.newrelic.com > Incidents: Identify performance issues and SLA gaps with New Relic Alerts incident reports. Ultimately, it’s important to solicit feedback from the cross-functional team on the causes of the incidents to determine how you can improve service delivery processes to prevent reoccurrences. One approach might be to focus on one or two notable incidents, use the New Relic UI to walk through the data points leading up to those incidents, and assess the actions that occurred. Summarize the incident and the cross-functional feedback on causes and potential solutions as succinctly as possible. Over time, you’ll notice patterns that will require deeper action. 4. Create follow-up tracking tickets With built-in or customizable integrations with ServiceNow and other common ticketing systems, New Relic helps you follow up on anomalies and performance shortfalls as they arise. Add the information provided by New Relic to the tracking system, and ensure that the team charged with solving the problem has all of the details they need to track down and resolve the issue.",

      "body": "Here are troubleshooting tips when using cross application traces. Note that this feature is not the same as distributed tracing, which is preferred over cross application tracing. Agent versions and protocols Make sure you meet these requirements for your agent's version, protocols, interfaces, or message queue libraries. If you are using a protocol that is not listed here, you will not see a connection between your applications. Agent version Notes C SDK Use distributed tracing. Go 1.11 or higher HTTP, HTTPS Java 3.9.0 or higher HTTP, HTTPs, JMS 1.1, RabbitMQ The Java agent also supports several message queue libraries, including those that use the JMS 1.1 interface. .NET 4.2 or higher HTTP, and supported .NET messaging systems Node.js 2.0.0 or higher HTTP, HTTPS, RabbitMQ PHP 4.19.0 or higher HTTP, HTTPS, and supported PHP message queuing systems Python 2.38.0.31 or higher HTTP, HTTPS, and supported Python message queuing systems Ruby 4.3.0 or higher HTTP, HTTPS, RabbitMQ Config file requirements In general, New Relic's cross application tracing feature is enabled by default. Requirements to change your configuration file vary, depending on your New Relic agent: C SDK (not supported) Go (not supported) Java .NET Node.js (no specific config file settings needed for Node.js) PHP Python Ruby High throughput apps Cross application traces rely on transaction events to associate related transactions. If you have a high throughput application, your agent may reach the maximum number of events that it can record in a minute and will fall back to sampling events. If a transaction’s events are sampled, you may see an incomplete cross application trace, including sometimes only the transactions that you are focused on. If your application has high throughput, some cross application traces will appear incomplete, sometimes with no links. Try viewing a different transaction trace. To reduce or eliminate sampling, you can also adjust the number of transaction events stored in your agent configuration. High throughput apps Troubleshooting tips Java From the transaction_events stanza, adjust the setting for max_samples_stored. Ruby Adjust the setting for analytics_events.max_samples_stored. Proxies If you expect to see a cross application trace link but it consistently does not appear, there may be a proxy or broker between your application’s communication. Cross application tracing relies on HTTP headers and JMS properties being passed from one application to other. HTTP proxies and message brokers sometimes strip those headers. Multi-threaded processing (Java) If one or more of your Java applications uses an async or \"reactive\" programming model, a transaction's activity may span across multiple threads. New Relic supports the Play framework and Servlet Async but not all async frameworks. For unsupported frameworks, activity on other threads is not reported as part of the transaction. Calls to other applications will not be traced. Multiple accounts Currently cross application traces do not cross New Relic accounts. If you have multiple New Relic accounts (including child accounts), you will only see traces for applications within one account. Our distributed tracing feature does cross account boundaries.",

      "body": "The word transaction can have several different meanings in the software industry. This document explains how the term is used by New Relic and how transactions are reported. What is a transaction? At New Relic, a transaction is defined as one logical unit of work in a software application. Specifically, it refers to the function calls and method calls that make up that unit of work. For APM, it will often refer to a web transaction, which represents activity that happens from when the application receives a web request to when the response is sent. When you install APM in a supported system, it begins automatically reporting web requests and other important functions and methods. To supplement the default level of monitoring, you can set up custom instrumentation to report additional transactions. Some frameworks do not have a natural concept of a transaction. In other words, there are no predefined pathways that can easily be recognized or monitored as transactions. To define transactions in such frameworks, you can use custom instrumentation. Types of transactions Cumulative transaction data appears in APM on the Transactions page. The two main categories of transactions are web and non-web: Web: Transactions are initiated with an HTTP request. For most organizations, these represent customer-centric interactions and thus are the most important transactions to monitor. Non-web: Non-web transactions are not initiated with a web request. They can include non-web worker processes, background processes, scripts, message queue activity, and other tasks. Transaction sub-types Our agents have these transaction sub-types: C SDK Sub-type Description Custom The execution of the named custom transaction. Usually recorded via manual instrumentation APIs. Function The invocation of the named function. Go Doesn't apply. Java Sub-type Description Custom The execution of the named custom transaction. Usually recorded via manual instrumentation APIs. framework The invocation of a framework that is recognized by the agent. .NET Sub-type Description Action The invocation of the named framework action. Used when the agent is able to identify a framework-specific action name. ASP The invocation of an ASP.NET request. Custom The execution of the named custom transaction. Usually recorded via manual instrumentation APIs. MonoRail The invocation of a MonoRail request. MVC The invocation of a MVC request. OpenRasta The invocation of an OpenRasta request. StatusCode The HTTP status code returned for the transaction. Often used when a more specific transaction sub-type is unavailable. WCF The invocation of a WCF request. WebAPI The invocation of a WebAPI request. WebService The invocation of a WebService request. Node.JS Sub-type Description Custom The execution of the named custom transaction. Usually recorded via manual instrumentation APIs. Message Message broker or queue communication. PHP Sub-type Description Action The invocation of the named framework action. Used when the agent is able to identify a framework-specific action name. Custom The execution of the named custom transaction. Usually recorded via manual instrumentation APIs. Function The invocation of the named function. PHP The invocation of a background PHP job. StatusCode The HTTP status code returned for the transaction. Often used when a more specific transaction sub-type is unavailable. unknown The invocation of an unknown web transaction or background job. URI The invocation of the named URI. Usually used when a framework or language level transaction name cannot be determined. Python Sub-type Description ASGIWeb WebTransaction from an ASGI application. Message Message broker or queue communication. WSGIWeb WebTransaction from a WSGI application. Ruby Sub-type Description Custom The execution of the named custom transaction. Usually recorded via manual instrumentation APIs. Transaction segments The individual functions and calls that make up a transaction are called segments. For example external service calls and database calls are segments, and both have their own UI pages in APM. The APM Transactions page displays aggregate transaction segment data. To add segments to a transaction, use custom instrumentation. To see the segments of a specific transaction, use transaction traces. Transaction naming For supported frameworks, transaction names can come from various sources, such as the name given to the transaction by the framework, function names detected during the transaction, or a web request's URL. For transactions that produce many names with a similar format, we consolidate those into general transaction categories. For example, a transaction might be displayed as /user/*/control_panel, where the * represents different user names. To rename transactions or adjust how names are consolidated, use custom instrumentation. Monitoring transactions Here are some other ways you can use APM to monitor transactions: If you want to monitor... Use this... Transactions important to your business Create key transactions, which emphasizes them in the UI and lets you set a custom level of monitoring for them. Async activity Follow the procedures to set up asynchronous activity for your specific APM language agent. Activity across applications Linking transactions across applications gives you more detail about business-relevant application activity. For more information, see the documentation about distributed tracing and cross application traces. Tip To get a high-level overview of all your applications and services, use the New Relic Explorer. Query transactions Transactions are available for querying with an in-depth set of default attributes attached. Using these attributes, you can run queries and create custom charts that APM does not provide by default. For information on how to query your data using our UI or NRQL, see Query New Relic data.",

Configure transaction trace settings via agent You can customize your transaction trace settings via New Relic agent configuration files and other \"local\" configuration methods such as environment variables. For more information about transaction trace configuration options, see the specific New Relic language agent's documentation: C SDK Go Java .NET Node PHP Python Ruby Configure transaction traces using server-side configuration The ability to configure transaction traces using server-side configuration depends on the New Relic agent. If server-side configuration is not supported, the transaction trace settings will be visible in the UI but not editable. If server-side configuration settings are available for your New Relic agent, you can see them at the following: one.newrelic.com > APM > (select an app) > Settings > Application > Server-side agent configuration. Transaction trace settings available using server-side configuration will differ depending on the New Relic agent you use. The UI includes descriptions of each. Settings in the UI may include: Transaction tracing and threshold Record SQL, including recording level and input fields Log SQL and stack trace threshold SQL query plans and threshold Error collection, including HTTP code and error class Slow query tracing Thread profiler Cross application tracing Configure traces for specific (key) transactions If you want to monitor or alert on a transaction differently than other transactions, make it a key transaction. This is useful, for example, when you want to set a transaction-specific Apdex that is different from your general Apdex T threshold. Changing a key transaction's Apdex changes the likelihood that it creates a transaction trace. For example: If you want to make it more likely a key transaction would generate transaction traces, lower its Apdex T value. If you want to make a key transaction less likely to be traced, raise its Apdex T value. Important If you have the transaction trace threshold set to a number of seconds, and not to the default Apdex setting, the number-of-seconds threshold will act as the threshold for all transactions, even for key transactions that have custom Apdex settings. Create custom transactions You can create custom transactions for app activity that isn't being automatically captured as a transaction by the New Relic agent. For more information, see Custom instrumentation. Collect HTTP request attributes, parameters For data security reasons, transaction traces do not collect potentially sensitive HTTP request attributes, sometimes called parameters. Traces do collect some basic HTTP request attributes, which New Relic calls agent attributes. To edit attribute collection settings, see the specific New Relic agent: C SDK Go Java .NET Node.js (does not allow HTTP attribute configuration) PHP Python Ruby For more information, see Collect custom attributes. Delete a transaction trace When you delete a transaction trace, it is deleted permanently. Delete a single transaction trace To delete a transaction trace record permanently: Go to one.newrelic.com > APM > (select an app) > Monitor > Transactions. Under Transaction traces click on the trace you want to delete. On the details page, select Delete this trace. Delete all transaction traces To delete all traces for the selected app permanently: Go to one.newrelic.com > APM > (select an app) > Monitor > Transactions. Click Delete all traces. It may take fifteen minutes or more for all transaction trace records to disappear from the UI. To delete all traces for your account, contact us at support.newrelic.com. Tip If you are doing general record cleanup, you may also want to delete databases and slow query traces or error traces. This will remove potentially sensitive data while retaining your other application data (such as Apdex, deployment information, etc.).",

      "body": "APM's cross application tracing lets you link transactions between your APM-monitored applications. What is cross application tracing? Important Instead of using cross application tracing, we recommend our distributed tracing features. Distributed tracing is an improvement on the cross application tracing feature and is recommended for large, distributed systems. APM's cross application traces link transactions between APM apps in your service-oriented architecture (SOA). This is useful, for example, to identify performance problems between your own application (the \"calling\" app) and any internal or external services (the \"called\" app), such as traffic to internal services. This helps you to: Spot bottlenecks in your cross application call flows. Understand from end to end how specific transactions are used by other applications and services. Diagnose problems faster and enhance collaboration across teams. Security considerations Cross application tracing relies on three HTTP headers in order to exchange information between the calling and called applications. The first two (X-NewRelic-ID and X-NewRelic-Transaction) appear as HTTP request headers in outgoing requests sent by an instrumented application. The remaining header (X-NewRelic-App-Data) is inserted into the HTTP response if the called application belongs to the same New Relic account as the calling application. New Relic obfuscates all of these headers using an obfuscation scheme identical to what we use for browser monitoring, but with a different key. HTTP header Description X-NewRelic-ID (in request header) Contains the account ID and application ID of the application making the call X-NewRelic-Transaction (in request header) Contains information about an individual transaction created by the call (a GUID unique to the calling transaction, along with information about upstream calls that spawned the transaction) X-NewRelic-App-Data (in the response if applicable) Contains information about the called application, including: Account ID Application ID Name of the called transaction Timing information for the called transaction GUID of the called transaction",

      "body": "The word transaction can have several different meanings in the software industry. This document explains how the term is used by New Relic and how transactions are reported. What is a transaction? At New Relic, a transaction is defined as one logical unit of work in a software application. Specifically, it refers to the function calls and method calls that make up that unit of work. For APM, it will often refer to a web transaction, which represents activity that happens from when the application receives a web request to when the response is sent. When you install APM in a supported system, it begins automatically reporting web requests and other important functions and methods. To supplement the default level of monitoring, you can set up custom instrumentation to report additional transactions. Some frameworks do not have a natural concept of a transaction. In other words, there are no predefined pathways that can easily be recognized or monitored as transactions. To define transactions in such frameworks, you can use custom instrumentation. Types of transactions Cumulative transaction data appears in APM on the Transactions page. The two main categories of transactions are web and non-web: Web: Transactions are initiated with an HTTP request. For most organizations, these represent customer-centric interactions and thus are the most important transactions to monitor. Non-web: Non-web transactions are not initiated with a web request. They can include non-web worker processes, background processes, scripts, message queue activity, and other tasks. Transaction sub-types Our agents have these transaction sub-types: C SDK Sub-type Description Custom The execution of the named custom transaction. Usually recorded via manual instrumentation APIs. Function The invocation of the named function. Go Doesn't apply. Java Sub-type Description Custom The execution of the named custom transaction. Usually recorded via manual instrumentation APIs. framework The invocation of a framework that is recognized by the agent. .NET Sub-type Description Action The invocation of the named framework action. Used when the agent is able to identify a framework-specific action name. ASP The invocation of an ASP.NET request. Custom The execution of the named custom transaction. Usually recorded via manual instrumentation APIs. MonoRail The invocation of a MonoRail request. MVC The invocation of a MVC request. OpenRasta The invocation of an OpenRasta request. StatusCode The HTTP status code returned for the transaction. Often used when a more specific transaction sub-type is unavailable. WCF The invocation of a WCF request. WebAPI The invocation of a WebAPI request. WebService The invocation of a WebService request. Node.JS Sub-type Description Custom The execution of the named custom transaction. Usually recorded via manual instrumentation APIs. Message Message broker or queue communication. PHP Sub-type Description Action The invocation of the named framework action. Used when the agent is able to identify a framework-specific action name. Custom The execution of the named custom transaction. Usually recorded via manual instrumentation APIs. Function The invocation of the named function. PHP The invocation of a background PHP job. StatusCode The HTTP status code returned for the transaction. Often used when a more specific transaction sub-type is unavailable. unknown The invocation of an unknown web transaction or background job. URI The invocation of the named URI. Usually used when a framework or language level transaction name cannot be determined. Python Sub-type Description ASGIWeb WebTransaction from an ASGI application. Message Message broker or queue communication. WSGIWeb WebTransaction from a WSGI application. Ruby Sub-type Description Custom The execution of the named custom transaction. Usually recorded via manual instrumentation APIs. Transaction segments The individual functions and calls that make up a transaction are called segments. For example external service calls and database calls are segments, and both have their own UI pages in APM. The APM Transactions page displays aggregate transaction segment data. To add segments to a transaction, use custom instrumentation. To see the segments of a specific transaction, use transaction traces. Transaction naming For supported frameworks, transaction names can come from various sources, such as the name given to the transaction by the framework, function names detected during the transaction, or a web request's URL. For transactions that produce many names with a similar format, we consolidate those into general transaction categories. For example, a transaction might be displayed as /user/*/control_panel, where the * represents different user names. To rename transactions or adjust how names are consolidated, use custom instrumentation. Monitoring transactions Here are some other ways you can use APM to monitor transactions: If you want to monitor... Use this... Transactions important to your business Create key transactions, which emphasizes them in the UI and lets you set a custom level of monitoring for them. Async activity Follow the procedures to set up asynchronous activity for your specific APM language agent. Activity across applications Linking transactions across applications gives you more detail about business-relevant application activity. For more information, see the documentation about distributed tracing and cross application traces. Tip To get a high-level overview of all your applications and services, use the New Relic Explorer. Query transactions Transactions are available for querying with an in-depth set of default attributes attached. Using these attributes, you can run queries and create custom charts that APM does not provide by default. For information on how to query your data using our UI or NRQL, see Query New Relic data.",

      "body": "In APM, transaction traces record in-depth details about your application's transactions and database calls. You can edit the default settings for transaction traces. Configure transaction trace settings via agent You can customize your transaction trace settings via New Relic agent configuration files and other \"local\" configuration methods such as environment variables. For more information about transaction trace configuration options, see the specific New Relic language agent's documentation: C SDK Go Java .NET Node PHP Python Ruby Configure transaction traces using server-side configuration The ability to configure transaction traces using server-side configuration depends on the New Relic agent. If server-side configuration is not supported, the transaction trace settings will be visible in the UI but not editable. If server-side configuration settings are available for your New Relic agent, you can see them at the following: one.newrelic.com > APM > (select an app) > Settings > Application > Server-side agent configuration. Transaction trace settings available using server-side configuration will differ depending on the New Relic agent you use. The UI includes descriptions of each. Settings in the UI may include: Transaction tracing and threshold Record SQL, including recording level and input fields Log SQL and stack trace threshold SQL query plans and threshold Error collection, including HTTP code and error class Slow query tracing Thread profiler Cross application tracing Configure traces for specific (key) transactions If you want to monitor or alert on a transaction differently than other transactions, make it a key transaction. This is useful, for example, when you want to set a transaction-specific Apdex that is different from your general Apdex T threshold. Changing a key transaction's Apdex changes the likelihood that it creates a transaction trace. For example: If you want to make it more likely a key transaction would generate transaction traces, lower its Apdex T value. If you want to make a key transaction less likely to be traced, raise its Apdex T value. Important If you have the transaction trace threshold set to a number of seconds, and not to the default Apdex setting, the number-of-seconds threshold will act as the threshold for all transactions, even for key transactions that have custom Apdex settings. Create custom transactions You can create custom transactions for app activity that isn't being automatically captured as a transaction by the New Relic agent. For more information, see Custom instrumentation. Collect HTTP request attributes, parameters For data security reasons, transaction traces do not collect potentially sensitive HTTP request attributes, sometimes called parameters. Traces do collect some basic HTTP request attributes, which New Relic calls agent attributes. To edit attribute collection settings, see the specific New Relic agent: C SDK Go Java .NET Node.js (does not allow HTTP attribute configuration) PHP Python Ruby For more information, see Collect custom attributes. Delete a transaction trace When you delete a transaction trace, it is deleted permanently. Delete a single transaction trace To delete a transaction trace record permanently: Go to one.newrelic.com > APM > (select an app) > Monitor > Transactions. Under Transaction traces click on the trace you want to delete. On the details page, select Delete this trace. Delete all transaction traces To delete all traces for the selected app permanently: Go to one.newrelic.com > APM > (select an app) > Monitor > Transactions. Click Delete all traces. It may take fifteen minutes or more for all transaction trace records to disappear from the UI. To delete all traces for your account, contact us at support.newrelic.com. Tip If you are doing general record cleanup, you may also want to delete databases and slow query traces or error traces. This will remove potentially sensitive data while retaining your other application data (such as Apdex, deployment information, etc.).",

      "body": "In APM, the Trace details tab shows the timing of individual segments in a transaction trace. This document describes the sections and features of the Trace details tab. Trace details page functions Go to one.newrelic.com > APM > (select an app) > Monitor > Transactions > (select a transaction trace) > Trace details. The Trace details page displays a table with the timing data for the segments in a transaction, plus additional features and functions: Trace details page Description Primary trace data, functions The top of each transaction trace UI page shows several primary pieces of data, including the trace time, response time, and, if available, CPU info. Also, sometimes the UI may indicate a partial trace. Available functions include: Delete this trace: When you delete a trace, it cannot be retrieved. Track as key transaction. Duration column The duration of each segment and subsegment is shown as both the number of milliseconds and a percentage of the total transaction time. Especially slow segments are color-coded. Segment column The Segment column displays segment names and counts. Fast and repeat calls may be automatically grouped together. Sometimes you may see Application code as the name of a segment or subsegment. To expand segments, use either of the following: The Expand performance problems button at the top of the page The expand and collapse dropdown arrows next to the segments Drilldown column The Drilldown column may contain icons that link to additional transaction data, if available. Timestamp column The Timestamp column displays the start time of a segment or subsegment, relative to the start of the transaction. For example, a value of 3.150 s indicates that that segment started 3.15 seconds into the transaction. Drilldown options In the Drilldown column, icons indicate that additional data is available: Icon Description Database queries The database icon links to the raw database query for that query segment. Depending on your transaction trace settings, this query can either show as raw data or obfuscated data. If the total time for the segment exceeds the query plan threshold in your settings, the query analysis also will appear, along with a stack trace showing the exact location of the call in your code. Stack traces The magnifying glass links to stack trace details. Aggregate transaction details This icon indicates that cross application tracing details are not available. However, you can select this icon to view aggregated transaction information across multiple invocations of the transaction. Color coding of segment duration data The Duration column of the Trace details table is color-coded: Red: More than 25% of the total transaction time was spent in this segment. Yellow: More than 5% of the total transaction time was spent in this segment. Color-coded durations do not necessarily indicate a problem. Whether the timing is actually a problem depends on what you consider normal and acceptable for your application. Application code in traces If a segment is listed as Application code in the table, it indicates that that section of code was not instrumented. You can use custom instrumentation to get more detail on that part of the code. Segments will often be listed as Application code for partial traces. Partial traces For performance reasons, APM only captures the first 2,000 segments of a transaction trace (900 for Node.js). If a transaction trace exceeds that number of segments, the agent truncates the transaction trace and displays a message at the top of the Details page: This is a partial trace. The APM agents have differing rules for when to truncate segments. APM agent Truncate segment rules C SDK Truncates based on segment priority: The root segment has the highest priority. Segments that have seen distributed tracing activity have second-highest priority. Slow segments have third-highest priority. For more information, see the C SDK's documentation about newrelic_transaction_tracer_config_t on GitHub. Go The segment duration must be greater than the TransactionTracer.SegmentThreshold value set in your Go segment configuration. Java, .NET, Ruby These agents truncate traces chronologically. For more information, see the transaction tracer documentation for Java, .NET, or Ruby as applicable. Node.js The Node.js agent only captures the first 900 segments of a transaction trace. For more information, see Node.js transaction tracer configuration. PHP Truncates based on segment duration; the slowest 2,000 segments are captured for the trace. For more information, see PHP transaction tracer configuration. Python Truncates based on segment duration; the slowest 2,000 segments are captured for the trace. For more information, see Python transaction tracer configuration. Segment grouping rules Transaction traces that have a lot of segments can be hard to interpret. New Relic helps you by automatically grouping fast and/or repeated method calls into a single segment grouping. For example, you might see a segment titled 7 fast method calls. This means that, because of their fast completion, New Relic assumed these calls were unlikely to be a problem and grouped them together. You can expand that grouping to see the individual segments. Rules underlying segment grouping include: Fast calls: When New Relic detects four or more consecutive segments with a duration of 7.5 ms or less, these are grouped into a single collapsed header. Identical calls: When New Relic detects four or more consecutive identical calls, this usually indicates an N+1 problem. These segments are collapsed. Expanding the collapsed node displays only the first three calls, not all calls.",

Transaction tracing was disabled. Transaction traces are enabled by default, but the setting may have been manually disabled. To solve this problem, change the setting back to enable transaction trace settings. The transaction does not meet criteria for tracing. The transaction is not meeting the criteria for being traced. For example: It is responding more quickly than the 4-times-Apdex threshold or a custom number-of-seconds threshold. It is not being selected as the slowest trace during the minute-long harvest cycle. App activity is not being captured as a transaction. If you don't see the transaction listed on the APM Transactions page, your APM agent is not capturing the activity as a transaction. In this situation, you must set up custom instrumentation to monitor the activity as a transaction. The custom transaction name includes brackets. If you used custom instrumentation to manually create a transaction, make sure you follow New Relic's naming rules. Important Do not use brackets [suffix] at the end of your transaction name. New Relic automatically strips brackets from the name. Instead, use parentheses (suffix) or other symbols if needed. No traces appear for any transactions. Change the Threshold value temporarily to 0.0001 so that transactions will definitely exceed the threshold. Be sure to return this to your original setting after you start receiving transaction traces.",

      "body": "This document explains what non-web transactions are in APM, and how you can instrument background tasks and other arbitrary activity to be reported as non-web transactions. What are non-web transactions? The two main APM transaction categories are web and non-web. Web transactions are transactions we detect as being initiated by a web request; they are the most common type of transaction reported by APM. Non-web transactions are transactions that are not web transactions; we do not detect they were initiated by a web request. This includes processes and jobs that do not handle web requests, such as message processing and background tasks. For example, you might schedule something to run periodically on your server to do database work, send emails, etc. The source is not a web request but something on your server. Some non-web transactions from supported frameworks or services are detected automatically by New Relic; others may be created using custom instrumentation. We intentionally separate your web and non-web transactions in the UI. Non-web vs. web transactions Comments Less directly important Non-web transactions are often background processes and tasks, and they are less directly important to your application's users when compared to web transactions. Long running Non-web transactions are often long-running processes. Separating them from web transactions prevents those results from skewing your customer-facing response times. Omitted from Apdex score Combining your non-web transactions with your web transactions would hurt your Apdex score (a measure of satisfaction with load times). This is why Apdex data for non-web transactions does not appear in the UI. Create non-web transactions To create new non-web transactions, follow the procedures for your APM language agent. C SDK Follow the procedures for instrumenting a non-web transaction. Go Follow the procedures for instrumenting a non-web transaction. Java Follow the procedures for instrumenting a transaction (instrumenting a transaction without web request parameters creates a non-web transaction). .NET By default, the APM .NET agent instruments IIS ASP workers. To instrument other (non-IIS) .NET applications, such as standalone (WCF) services, console apps, and other Windows services, see Instrumenting custom applications and Instrumenting WCF applications. Important For IIS applications, you cannot change web transactions to non-web transactions. Node.js Use startBackgroundTransaction(). PHP To mark a transaction as non-web: use newrelic_background_job and set the flag to true. The PHP agent reports all command-line run scripts as non-web transactions. Python See Python agent non-web transactions. The Python agent also supports non-web transaction reporting from Celery and Gearman. Ruby See Ruby agent non-web transactions. View non-web transactions To view non-web transaction data in the New Relic UI, go to the main chart on the following pages, and then select the Non-web option in the dropdown: New Relic Explorer: Go to one.newrelic.com > Explorer > (select an app) > Summary. APM: Go to one.newrelic.com > APM > (select an app) > Summary. Transactions: Go to one.newrelic.com > APM > (select an app) > Monitor > Transactions.",

Trace details page functions Go to one.newrelic.com > APM > (select an app) > Monitor > Transactions > (select a transaction trace) > Trace details. The Trace details page displays a table with the timing data for the segments in a transaction, plus additional features and functions: Trace details page Description Primary trace data, functions The top of each transaction trace UI page shows several primary pieces of data, including the trace time, response time, and, if available, CPU info. Also, sometimes the UI may indicate a partial trace. Available functions include: Delete this trace: When you delete a trace, it cannot be retrieved. Track as key transaction. Duration column The duration of each segment and subsegment is shown as both the number of milliseconds and a percentage of the total transaction time. Especially slow segments are color-coded. Segment column The Segment column displays segment names and counts. Fast and repeat calls may be automatically grouped together. Sometimes you may see Application code as the name of a segment or subsegment. To expand segments, use either of the following: The Expand performance problems button at the top of the page The expand and collapse dropdown arrows next to the segments Drilldown column The Drilldown column may contain icons that link to additional transaction data, if available. Timestamp column The Timestamp column displays the start time of a segment or subsegment, relative to the start of the transaction. For example, a value of 3.150 s indicates that that segment started 3.15 seconds into the transaction. Drilldown options In the Drilldown column, icons indicate that additional data is available: Icon Description Database queries The database icon links to the raw database query for that query segment. Depending on your transaction trace settings, this query can either show as raw data or obfuscated data. If the total time for the segment exceeds the query plan threshold in your settings, the query analysis also will appear, along with a stack trace showing the exact location of the call in your code. Stack traces The magnifying glass links to stack trace details. Aggregate transaction details This icon indicates that cross application tracing details are not available. However, you can select this icon to view aggregated transaction information across multiple invocations of the transaction. Color coding of segment duration data The Duration column of the Trace details table is color-coded: Red: More than 25% of the total transaction time was spent in this segment. Yellow: More than 5% of the total transaction time was spent in this segment. Color-coded durations do not necessarily indicate a problem. Whether the timing is actually a problem depends on what you consider normal and acceptable for your application. Application code in traces If a segment is listed as Application code in the table, it indicates that that section of code was not instrumented. You can use custom instrumentation to get more detail on that part of the code. Segments will often be listed as Application code for partial traces. Partial traces For performance reasons, APM only captures the first 2,000 segments of a transaction trace (900 for Node.js). If a transaction trace exceeds that number of segments, the agent truncates the transaction trace and displays a message at the top of the Details page: This is a partial trace. The APM agents have differing rules for when to truncate segments. APM agent Truncate segment rules C SDK Truncates based on segment priority: The root segment has the highest priority. Segments that have seen distributed tracing activity have second-highest priority. Slow segments have third-highest priority. For more information, see the C SDK's documentation about newrelic_transaction_tracer_config_t on GitHub. Go The segment duration must be greater than the TransactionTracer.SegmentThreshold value set in your Go segment configuration. Java, .NET, Ruby These agents truncate traces chronologically. For more information, see the transaction tracer documentation for Java, .NET, or Ruby as applicable. Node.js The Node.js agent only captures the first 900 segments of a transaction trace. For more information, see Node.js transaction tracer configuration. PHP Truncates based on segment duration; the slowest 2,000 segments are captured for the trace. For more information, see PHP transaction tracer configuration. Python Truncates based on segment duration; the slowest 2,000 segments are captured for the trace. For more information, see Python transaction tracer configuration. Segment grouping rules Transaction traces that have a lot of segments can be hard to interpret. New Relic helps you by automatically grouping fast and/or repeated method calls into a single segment grouping. For example, you might see a segment titled 7 fast method calls. This means that, because of their fast completion, New Relic assumed these calls were unlikely to be a problem and grouped them together. You can expand that grouping to see the individual segments. Rules underlying segment grouping include: Fast calls: When New Relic detects four or more consecutive segments with a duration of 7.5 ms or less, these are grouped into a single collapsed header. Identical calls: When New Relic detects four or more consecutive identical calls, this usually indicates an N+1 problem. These segments are collapsed. Expanding the collapsed node displays only the first three calls, not all calls.",

These may be web transactions or non-web transactions that are important to your business. For most New Relic agents, a key transaction can be any type of transaction. For the PHP, Node.js, and Go agents, only web transactions can be turned into key transactions. What are key transactions? In APM, making a transaction a key transaction gives you the following benefits: Key transactions are grouped together in the New Relic UI, so they are easy to find and examine. You can set a custom Apdex threshold for a key transaction. You can set an alert policy for a key transaction. Key transactions are useful for: Important transactions. For your app's most important transactions, making them key transactions means you can quickly find and examine them. You can set stricter Apdex requirements for them, and you can create alert policies for them. Slow transactions. If a transaction is regularly slower than other transactions, it can bring down the Apdex score of the entire application. When you make a transaction a key transaction, you can set a longer-duration Apdex threshold for it so it won't bring down your app's Apdex score. Create key transactions To create key transactions, see Create and update key transactions.

For most New Relic agents, a key transaction can be any type of transaction. For the PHP, Node.js, and Go agents, only web transactions can be turned into key transactions. Create key transactions There are two ways to create a key transaction: From the key transaction index Go to one.newrelic.com > More > Key transactions to view the key transactions index. Select Add more. From a specific transaction page Go to one.newrelic.com > APM > (select an app) > Summary In the center of the page under Transactions, select a record. Select Track as key transaction. Rename a key transaction Here's how to rename: Go to one.newrelic.com > More > Key transactions. From the index, select the gear icon for the key transaction you want to rename. Enter a new name for the transaction, then save. Change Apdex settings You can set a custom Apdex threshold for a key transaction if it is a web transaction. (Apdex is not applicable for non-web-transactions.) This is useful if the transaction is expected to be faster or slower than other transactions. Important Key transaction Apdex settings override the T value set for that app. This can mean, for example, that a key transaction could be reported as Satisfied but a different transaction in the same app with the same response time could be Frustrated. To change a key transaction's Apdex threshold: Go to one.newrelic.com > More > Key transactions. Select the icon for the transaction you want to edit. Enter a new value in seconds under the Apdex T heading, then save. The Apdex threshold affects how key transaction traces are created. Delete key transactions To delete a key transaction: Go to one.newrelic.com > More > Key transactions. Select the gear icon for the key transaction you want to delete. Select Stop tracking. New Relic automatically deletes any associated alerts and events for the deleted key transaction.",

      "body": "In APM, the Trace details tab shows the timing of individual segments in a transaction trace. This document describes the sections and features of the Trace details tab. Trace details page functions Go to one.newrelic.com > APM > (select an app) > Monitor > Transactions > (select a transaction trace) > Trace details. The Trace details page displays a table with the timing data for the segments in a transaction, plus additional features and functions: Trace details page Description Primary trace data, functions The top of each transaction trace UI page shows several primary pieces of data, including the trace time, response time, and, if available, CPU info. Also, sometimes the UI may indicate a partial trace. Available functions include: Delete this trace: When you delete a trace, it cannot be retrieved. Track as key transaction. Duration column The duration of each segment and subsegment is shown as both the number of milliseconds and a percentage of the total transaction time. Especially slow segments are color-coded. Segment column The Segment column displays segment names and counts. Fast and repeat calls may be automatically grouped together. Sometimes you may see Application code as the name of a segment or subsegment. To expand segments, use either of the following: The Expand performance problems button at the top of the page The expand and collapse dropdown arrows next to the segments Drilldown column The Drilldown column may contain icons that link to additional transaction data, if available. Timestamp column The Timestamp column displays the start time of a segment or subsegment, relative to the start of the transaction. For example, a value of 3.150 s indicates that that segment started 3.15 seconds into the transaction. Drilldown options In the Drilldown column, icons indicate that additional data is available: Icon Description Database queries The database icon links to the raw database query for that query segment. Depending on your transaction trace settings, this query can either show as raw data or obfuscated data. If the total time for the segment exceeds the query plan threshold in your settings, the query analysis also will appear, along with a stack trace showing the exact location of the call in your code. Stack traces The magnifying glass links to stack trace details. Aggregate transaction details This icon indicates that cross application tracing details are not available. However, you can select this icon to view aggregated transaction information across multiple invocations of the transaction. Color coding of segment duration data The Duration column of the Trace details table is color-coded: Red: More than 25% of the total transaction time was spent in this segment. Yellow: More than 5% of the total transaction time was spent in this segment. Color-coded durations do not necessarily indicate a problem. Whether the timing is actually a problem depends on what you consider normal and acceptable for your application. Application code in traces If a segment is listed as Application code in the table, it indicates that that section of code was not instrumented. You can use custom instrumentation to get more detail on that part of the code. Segments will often be listed as Application code for partial traces. Partial traces For performance reasons, APM only captures the first 2,000 segments of a transaction trace (900 for Node.js). If a transaction trace exceeds that number of segments, the agent truncates the transaction trace and displays a message at the top of the Details page: This is a partial trace. The APM agents have differing rules for when to truncate segments. APM agent Truncate segment rules C SDK Truncates based on segment priority: The root segment has the highest priority. Segments that have seen distributed tracing activity have second-highest priority. Slow segments have third-highest priority. For more information, see the C SDK's documentation about newrelic_transaction_tracer_config_t on GitHub. Go The segment duration must be greater than the TransactionTracer.SegmentThreshold value set in your Go segment configuration. Java, .NET, Ruby These agents truncate traces chronologically. For more information, see the transaction tracer documentation for Java, .NET, or Ruby as applicable. Node.js The Node.js agent only captures the first 900 segments of a transaction trace. For more information, see Node.js transaction tracer configuration. PHP Truncates based on segment duration; the slowest 2,000 segments are captured for the trace. For more information, see PHP transaction tracer configuration. Python Truncates based on segment duration; the slowest 2,000 segments are captured for the trace. For more information, see Python transaction tracer configuration. Segment grouping rules Transaction traces that have a lot of segments can be hard to interpret. New Relic helps you by automatically grouping fast and/or repeated method calls into a single segment grouping. For example, you might see a segment titled 7 fast method calls. This means that, because of their fast completion, New Relic assumed these calls were unlikely to be a problem and grouped them together. You can expand that grouping to see the individual segments. Rules underlying segment grouping include: Fast calls: When New Relic detects four or more consecutive segments with a duration of 7.5 ms or less, these are grouped into a single collapsed header. Identical calls: When New Relic detects four or more consecutive identical calls, this usually indicates an N+1 problem. These segments are collapsed. Expanding the collapsed node displays only the first three calls, not all calls.",

      "body": "In APM, a transaction trace gives a detailed snapshot of a single transaction in your application. A transaction trace records the available function calls, database calls, and external calls. You can use transaction traces to troubleshoot performance issues and to get detailed low-level insight into how your app is working. What transactions record traces In APM, a transaction trace records the segments that make up a transaction. Because they give you more detail, you can use transaction traces to analyze and troubleshoot performance issues. Here are the default rules that govern which transactions a New Relic agent traces: Over the minute-long harvest cycle, all transactions that violate the threshold (either four times your Apdex T value or a specific number of seconds) are added to a pool of transactions. At the end of that minute, the New Relic agent selects the slowest transaction in that pool and performs a transaction trace on it. These are the general rules, but there are some agent-specific differences. For example: The Java agent collects occasional non-slow transactions. If one transaction is frequently traced, some agents will select other transactions to give a more diverse sampling. If you don't see traces in your account, it's possible that no transactions meet the necessary criteria. In this situation, you can adjust transaction trace settings to ensure some transactions will be traced. If you use Synthetic, you will likely have Synthetic monitor traces. Synthetic traces can happen more frequently than APM traces, potentially several per minute. Configure transaction traces To configure or edit trace settings, see the procedures for: Transaction traces Key transaction traces View transaction traces in UI To view transaction traces: Do one of the following: New Relic Explorer: Go to one.newrelic.com > Explorer > (select an app) > Monitor > Transactions. APM: Go to one.newrelic.com > APM > (select an app) > Monitor > Transactions. In the Transaction traces section, click transaction traces to view additional details. Troubleshoot an issue with transaction traces If you expect to see transaction traces but do not see them, follow the troubleshooting procedures.

Trace details page functions Go to one.newrelic.com > APM > (select an app) > Monitor > Transactions > (select a transaction trace) > Trace details. The Trace details page displays a table with the timing data for the segments in a transaction, plus additional features and functions: Trace details page Description Primary trace data, functions The top of each transaction trace UI page shows several primary pieces of data, including the trace time, response time, and, if available, CPU info. Also, sometimes the UI may indicate a partial trace. Available functions include: Delete this trace: When you delete a trace, it cannot be retrieved. Track as key transaction. Duration column The duration of each segment and subsegment is shown as both the number of milliseconds and a percentage of the total transaction time. Especially slow segments are color-coded. Segment column The Segment column displays segment names and counts. Fast and repeat calls may be automatically grouped together. Sometimes you may see Application code as the name of a segment or subsegment. To expand segments, use either of the following: The Expand performance problems button at the top of the page The expand and collapse dropdown arrows next to the segments Drilldown column The Drilldown column may contain icons that link to additional transaction data, if available. Timestamp column The Timestamp column displays the start time of a segment or subsegment, relative to the start of the transaction. For example, a value of 3.150 s indicates that that segment started 3.15 seconds into the transaction. Drilldown options In the Drilldown column, icons indicate that additional data is available: Icon Description Database queries The database icon links to the raw database query for that query segment. Depending on your transaction trace settings, this query can either show as raw data or obfuscated data. If the total time for the segment exceeds the query plan threshold in your settings, the query analysis also will appear, along with a stack trace showing the exact location of the call in your code. Stack traces The magnifying glass links to stack trace details. Aggregate transaction details This icon indicates that cross application tracing details are not available. However, you can select this icon to view aggregated transaction information across multiple invocations of the transaction. Color coding of segment duration data The Duration column of the Trace details table is color-coded: Red: More than 25% of the total transaction time was spent in this segment. Yellow: More than 5% of the total transaction time was spent in this segment. Color-coded durations do not necessarily indicate a problem. Whether the timing is actually a problem depends on what you consider normal and acceptable for your application. Application code in traces If a segment is listed as Application code in the table, it indicates that that section of code was not instrumented. You can use custom instrumentation to get more detail on that part of the code. Segments will often be listed as Application code for partial traces. Partial traces For performance reasons, APM only captures the first 2,000 segments of a transaction trace (900 for Node.js). If a transaction trace exceeds that number of segments, the agent truncates the transaction trace and displays a message at the top of the Details page: This is a partial trace. The APM agents have differing rules for when to truncate segments. APM agent Truncate segment rules C SDK Truncates based on segment priority: The root segment has the highest priority. Segments that have seen distributed tracing activity have second-highest priority. Slow segments have third-highest priority. For more information, see the C SDK's documentation about newrelic_transaction_tracer_config_t on GitHub. Go The segment duration must be greater than the TransactionTracer.SegmentThreshold value set in your Go segment configuration. Java, .NET, Ruby These agents truncate traces chronologically. For more information, see the transaction tracer documentation for Java, .NET, or Ruby as applicable. Node.js The Node.js agent only captures the first 900 segments of a transaction trace. For more information, see Node.js transaction tracer configuration. PHP Truncates based on segment duration; the slowest 2,000 segments are captured for the trace. For more information, see PHP transaction tracer configuration. Python Truncates based on segment duration; the slowest 2,000 segments are captured for the trace. For more information, see Python transaction tracer configuration. Segment grouping rules Transaction traces that have a lot of segments can be hard to interpret. New Relic helps you by automatically grouping fast and/or repeated method calls into a single segment grouping. For example, you might see a segment titled 7 fast method calls. This means that, because of their fast completion, New Relic assumed these calls were unlikely to be a problem and grouped them together. You can expand that grouping to see the individual segments. Rules underlying segment grouping include: Fast calls: When New Relic detects four or more consecutive segments with a duration of 7.5 ms or less, these are grouped into a single collapsed header. Identical calls: When New Relic detects four or more consecutive identical calls, this usually indicates an N+1 problem. These segments are collapsed. Expanding the collapsed node displays only the first three calls, not all calls.",

Configure database query settings You can change database query settings in the same way you change other transaction trace settings; for example, via configuring the New Relic agent or, for some agents, via the UI. Common database query setting changes include: Collecting raw query data instead of obfuscated or turning off query collection Changing the stack trace threshold Turning on query explain plan collection Use database queries to improve performance Here are some tips to improve your app's database performance: Use database queries Comments Time Look for queries where the TOTAL DURATION contributes large amounts of time to the overall transaction time. This indicates a good place to try to enhance your database query with an index or some other optimization. Duplicate queries Look for queries that repeatedly query the same kind of information; for example, multiple queries to look up individual account IDs. Try rewriting the query to INCLUDE the specific values (account IDs 1, 2, 10, 14, 17, etc.) so that a single query can get all the relevant items. Database overhead Look at the structure of your queries to see if there are opportunities to combine different types of information into a single call; for example, querying for the account ID, name, etc. This is useful, for example, if your database center is in a different geographical location, because this will reduce overhead. The amount of time for your database request and response may be very fast. However, by combining requests into fewer calls, you can reduce that time even more. MySQL From your app's main APM Summary page, compare the database time on the main chart to other processing time. Sudden spikes or larger amounts of database time compared to other processing times may indicate problems. Find other slow queries The Trace details page is useful for examining a specific transaction's details. To see all of your application's slowest queries in one place, use the Slow queries feature.",

Depending on your transaction trace settings, this query can either show as raw data or obfuscated data. If the total time for the segment exceeds the query plan threshold in your settings, the query analysis also will appear, along with a stack trace showing the exact location of the call in your code. Stack traces The magnifying glass links to stack trace details. Aggregate transaction details This icon indicates that cross application tracing details are not available. However, you can select this icon to view aggregated transaction information across multiple invocations of the transaction. Color coding of segment duration data The Duration column of the Trace details table is color-coded: Red: More than 25% of the total transaction time was spent in this segment. Yellow: More than 5% of the total transaction time was spent in this segment. Color-coded durations do not necessarily indicate a problem. Whether the timing is actually a problem depends on what you consider normal and acceptable for your application. Application code in traces If a segment is listed as Application code in the table, it indicates that that section of code was not instrumented. You can use custom instrumentation to get more detail on that part of the code. Segments will often be listed as Application code for partial traces. Partial traces For performance reasons, APM only captures the first 2,000 segments of a transaction trace (900 for Node.js). If a transaction trace exceeds that number of segments, the agent truncates the transaction trace and displays a message at the top of the Details page: This is a partial trace. The APM agents have differing rules for when to truncate segments. APM agent Truncate segment rules C SDK Truncates based on segment priority: The root segment has the highest priority. Segments that have seen distributed tracing activity have second-highest priority. Slow segments have third-highest priority. For more information, see the C SDK's documentation about newrelic_transaction_tracer_config_t on GitHub. Go The segment duration must be greater than the TransactionTracer.SegmentThreshold value set in your Go segment configuration. Java, .NET, Ruby These agents truncate traces chronologically. For more information, see the transaction tracer documentation for Java, .NET, or Ruby as applicable. Node.js The Node.js agent only captures the first 900 segments of a transaction trace. For more information, see Node.js transaction tracer configuration. PHP Truncates based on segment duration; the slowest 2,000 segments are captured for the trace. For more information, see PHP transaction tracer configuration. Python Truncates based on segment duration; the slowest 2,000 segments are captured for the trace. For more information, see Python transaction tracer configuration. Segment grouping rules Transaction traces that have a lot of segments can be hard to interpret. New Relic helps you by automatically grouping fast and/or repeated method calls into a single segment grouping. For example, you might see a segment titled 7 fast method calls. This means that, because of their fast completion, New Relic assumed these calls were unlikely to be a problem and grouped them together. You can expand that grouping to see the individual segments. Rules underlying segment grouping include: Fast calls: When New Relic detects four or more consecutive segments with a duration of 7.5 ms or less, these are grouped into a single collapsed header. Identical calls: When New Relic detects four or more consecutive identical calls, this usually indicates an N+1 problem. These segments are collapsed. Expanding the collapsed node displays only the first three calls, not all calls.",

A transaction trace records the available function calls, database calls, and external calls. You can use transaction traces to troubleshoot performance issues and to get detailed low-level insight into how your app is working. What transactions record traces In APM, a transaction trace records the segments that make up a transaction. Because they give you more detail, you can use transaction traces to analyze and troubleshoot performance issues. Here are the default rules that govern which transactions a New Relic agent traces: Over the minute-long harvest cycle, all transactions that violate the threshold (either four times your Apdex T value or a specific number of seconds) are added to a pool of transactions. At the end of that minute, the New Relic agent selects the slowest transaction in that pool and performs a transaction trace on it. These are the general rules, but there are some agent-specific differences. For example: The Java agent collects occasional non-slow transactions. If one transaction is frequently traced, some agents will select other transactions to give a more diverse sampling. If you don't see traces in your account, it's possible that no transactions meet the necessary criteria. In this situation, you can adjust transaction trace settings to ensure some transactions will be traced. If you use Synthetic, you will likely have Synthetic monitor traces.

The Trace details page displays a table with the timing data for the segments in a transaction, plus additional features and functions: Trace details page Description Primary trace data, functions The top of each transaction trace UI page shows several primary pieces of data, including the trace time, response time, and, if available, CPU info. Also, sometimes the UI may indicate a partial trace. Available functions include: Delete this trace: When you delete a trace, it cannot be retrieved. Track as key transaction. Duration column The duration of each segment and subsegment is shown as both the number of milliseconds and a percentage of the total transaction time. Especially slow segments are color-coded. Segment column The Segment column displays segment names and counts. Fast and repeat calls may be automatically grouped together.

Trace details page functions Go to one.newrelic.com > APM > (select an app) > Monitor > Transactions > (select a transaction trace) > Trace details. The Trace details page displays a table with the timing data for the segments in a transaction, plus additional features and functions: Trace details page Description Primary trace data, functions The top of each transaction trace UI page shows several primary pieces of data, including the trace time, response time, and, if available, CPU info. Also, sometimes the UI may indicate a partial trace. Available functions include: Delete this trace: When you delete a trace, it cannot be retrieved. Track as key transaction. Duration column The duration of each segment and subsegment is shown as both the number of milliseconds and a percentage of the total transaction time. Especially slow segments are color-coded. Segment column The Segment column displays segment names and counts. Fast and repeat calls may be automatically grouped together. Sometimes you may see Application code as the name of a segment or subsegment. To expand segments, use either of the following: The Expand performance problems button at the top of the page The expand and collapse dropdown arrows next to the segments Drilldown column The Drilldown column may contain icons that link to additional transaction data, if available. Timestamp column The Timestamp column displays the start time of a segment or subsegment, relative to the start of the transaction. For example, a value of 3.150 s indicates that that segment started 3.15 seconds into the transaction. Drilldown options In the Drilldown column, icons indicate that additional data is available: Icon Description Database queries The database icon links to the raw database query for that query segment. Depending on your transaction trace settings, this query can either show as raw data or obfuscated data. If the total time for the segment exceeds the query plan threshold in your settings, the query analysis also will appear, along with a stack trace showing the exact location of the call in your code. Stack traces The magnifying glass links to stack trace details. Aggregate transaction details This icon indicates that cross application tracing details are not available. However, you can select this icon to view aggregated transaction information across multiple invocations of the transaction. Color coding of segment duration data The Duration column of the Trace details table is color-coded: Red: More than 25% of the total transaction time was spent in this segment. Yellow: More than 5% of the total transaction time was spent in this segment. Color-coded durations do not necessarily indicate a problem. Whether the timing is actually a problem depends on what you consider normal and acceptable for your application. Application code in traces If a segment is listed as Application code in the table, it indicates that that section of code was not instrumented. You can use custom instrumentation to get more detail on that part of the code. Segments will often be listed as Application code for partial traces. Partial traces For performance reasons, APM only captures the first 2,000 segments of a transaction trace (900 for Node.js). If a transaction trace exceeds that number of segments, the agent truncates the transaction trace and displays a message at the top of the Details page: This is a partial trace. The APM agents have differing rules for when to truncate segments. APM agent Truncate segment rules C SDK Truncates based on segment priority: The root segment has the highest priority. Segments that have seen distributed tracing activity have second-highest priority. Slow segments have third-highest priority. For more information, see the C SDK's documentation about newrelic_transaction_tracer_config_t on GitHub. Go The segment duration must be greater than the TransactionTracer.SegmentThreshold value set in your Go segment configuration. Java, .NET, Ruby These agents truncate traces chronologically. For more information, see the transaction tracer documentation for Java, .NET, or Ruby as applicable. Node.js The Node.js agent only captures the first 900 segments of a transaction trace. For more information, see Node.js transaction tracer configuration. PHP Truncates based on segment duration; the slowest 2,000 segments are captured for the trace. For more information, see PHP transaction tracer configuration. Python Truncates based on segment duration; the slowest 2,000 segments are captured for the trace. For more information, see Python transaction tracer configuration. Segment grouping rules Transaction traces that have a lot of segments can be hard to interpret. New Relic helps you by automatically grouping fast and/or repeated method calls into a single segment grouping. For example, you might see a segment titled 7 fast method calls. This means that, because of their fast completion, New Relic assumed these calls were unlikely to be a problem and grouped them together. You can expand that grouping to see the individual segments. Rules underlying segment grouping include: Fast calls: When New Relic detects four or more consecutive segments with a duration of 7.5 ms or less, these are grouped into a single collapsed header. Identical calls: When New Relic detects four or more consecutive identical calls, this usually indicates an N+1 problem. These segments are collapsed. Expanding the collapsed node displays only the first three calls, not all calls.",

A transaction trace records the available function calls, database calls, and external calls. You can use transaction traces to troubleshoot performance issues and to get detailed low-level insight into how your app is working. What transactions record traces In APM, a transaction trace records the segments that make up a transaction. Because they give you more detail, you can use transaction traces to analyze and troubleshoot performance issues. Here are the default rules that govern which transactions a New Relic agent traces: Over the minute-long harvest cycle, all transactions that violate the threshold (either four times your Apdex T value or a specific number of seconds) are added to a pool of transactions. At the end of that minute, the New Relic agent selects the slowest transaction in that pool and performs a transaction trace on it. These are the general rules, but there are some agent-specific differences. For example: The Java agent collects occasional non-slow transactions. If one transaction is frequently traced, some agents will select other transactions to give a more diverse sampling. If you don't see traces in your account, it's possible that no transactions meet the necessary criteria. In this situation, you can adjust transaction trace settings to ensure some transactions will be traced. If you use Synthetic, you will likely have Synthetic monitor traces. Synthetic traces can happen more frequently than APM traces, potentially several per minute.

Configure database query settings You can change database query settings in the same way you change other transaction trace settings; for example, via configuring the New Relic agent or, for some agents, via the UI. Common database query setting changes include: Collecting raw query data instead of obfuscated or turning off query collection Changing the stack trace threshold Turning on query explain plan collection Use database queries to improve performance Here are some tips to improve your app's database performance: Use database queries Comments Time Look for queries where the TOTAL DURATION contributes large amounts of time to the overall transaction time. This indicates a good place to try to enhance your database query with an index or some other optimization. Duplicate queries Look for queries that repeatedly query the same kind of information; for example, multiple queries to look up individual account IDs. Try rewriting the query to INCLUDE the specific values (account IDs 1, 2, 10, 14, 17, etc.) so that a single query can get all the relevant items. Database overhead Look at the structure of your queries to see if there are opportunities to combine different types of information into a single call; for example, querying for the account ID, name, etc. This is useful, for example, if your database center is in a different geographical location, because this will reduce overhead. The amount of time for your database request and response may be very fast. However, by combining requests into fewer calls, you can reduce that time even more. MySQL From your app's main APM Summary page, compare the database time on the main chart to other processing time. Sudden spikes or larger amounts of database time compared to other processing times may indicate problems. Find other slow queries The Trace details page is useful for examining a specific transaction's details. To see all of your application's slowest queries in one place, use the Slow queries feature.",

Trace details page functions Go to one.newrelic.com > APM > (select an app) > Monitor > Transactions > (select a transaction trace) > Trace details. The Trace details page displays a table with the timing data for the segments in a transaction, plus additional features and functions: Trace details page Description Primary trace data, functions The top of each transaction trace UI page shows several primary pieces of data, including the trace time, response time, and, if available, CPU info. Also, sometimes the UI may indicate a partial trace. Available functions include: Delete this trace: When you delete a trace, it cannot be retrieved. Track as key transaction. Duration column The duration of each segment and subsegment is shown as both the number of milliseconds and a percentage of the total transaction time. Especially slow segments are color-coded. Segment column The Segment column displays segment names and counts. Fast and repeat calls may be automatically grouped together. Sometimes you may see Application code as the name of a segment or subsegment. To expand segments, use either of the following: The Expand performance problems button at the top of the page The expand and collapse dropdown arrows next to the segments Drilldown column The Drilldown column may contain icons that link to additional transaction data, if available. Timestamp column The Timestamp column displays the start time of a segment or subsegment, relative to the start of the transaction. For example, a value of 3.150 s indicates that that segment started 3.15 seconds into the transaction. Drilldown options In the Drilldown column, icons indicate that additional data is available: Icon Description Database queries The database icon links to the raw database query for that query segment. Depending on your transaction trace settings, this query can either show as raw data or obfuscated data. If the total time for the segment exceeds the query plan threshold in your settings, the query analysis also will appear, along with a stack trace showing the exact location of the call in your code. Stack traces The magnifying glass links to stack trace details. Aggregate transaction details This icon indicates that cross application tracing details are not available. However, you can select this icon to view aggregated transaction information across multiple invocations of the transaction. Color coding of segment duration data The Duration column of the Trace details table is color-coded: Red: More than 25% of the total transaction time was spent in this segment. Yellow: More than 5% of the total transaction time was spent in this segment. Color-coded durations do not necessarily indicate a problem. Whether the timing is actually a problem depends on what you consider normal and acceptable for your application. Application code in traces If a segment is listed as Application code in the table, it indicates that that section of code was not instrumented. You can use custom instrumentation to get more detail on that part of the code. Segments will often be listed as Application code for partial traces. Partial traces For performance reasons, APM only captures the first 2,000 segments of a transaction trace (900 for Node.js). If a transaction trace exceeds that number of segments, the agent truncates the transaction trace and displays a message at the top of the Details page: This is a partial trace. The APM agents have differing rules for when to truncate segments. APM agent Truncate segment rules C SDK Truncates based on segment priority: The root segment has the highest priority. Segments that have seen distributed tracing activity have second-highest priority. Slow segments have third-highest priority. For more information, see the C SDK's documentation about newrelic_transaction_tracer_config_t on GitHub. Go The segment duration must be greater than the TransactionTracer.SegmentThreshold value set in your Go segment configuration. Java, .NET, Ruby These agents truncate traces chronologically. For more information, see the transaction tracer documentation for Java, .NET, or Ruby as applicable. Node.js The Node.js agent only captures the first 900 segments of a transaction trace. For more information, see Node.js transaction tracer configuration. PHP Truncates based on segment duration; the slowest 2,000 segments are captured for the trace. For more information, see PHP transaction tracer configuration. Python Truncates based on segment duration; the slowest 2,000 segments are captured for the trace. For more information, see Python transaction tracer configuration. Segment grouping rules Transaction traces that have a lot of segments can be hard to interpret. New Relic helps you by automatically grouping fast and/or repeated method calls into a single segment grouping. For example, you might see a segment titled 7 fast method calls. This means that, because of their fast completion, New Relic assumed these calls were unlikely to be a problem and grouped them together. You can expand that grouping to see the individual segments. Rules underlying segment grouping include: Fast calls: When New Relic detects four or more consecutive segments with a duration of 7.5 ms or less, these are grouped into a single collapsed header. Identical calls: When New Relic detects four or more consecutive identical calls, this usually indicates an N+1 problem. These segments are collapsed. Expanding the collapsed node displays only the first three calls, not all calls.",

      "body": "In APM, a transaction trace gives a detailed snapshot of a single transaction in your application. A transaction trace records the available function calls, database calls, and external calls. You can use transaction traces to troubleshoot performance issues and to get detailed low-level insight into how your app is working. What transactions record traces In APM, a transaction trace records the segments that make up a transaction. Because they give you more detail, you can use transaction traces to analyze and troubleshoot performance issues. Here are the default rules that govern which transactions a New Relic agent traces: Over the minute-long harvest cycle, all transactions that violate the threshold (either four times your Apdex T value or a specific number of seconds) are added to a pool of transactions. At the end of that minute, the New Relic agent selects the slowest transaction in that pool and performs a transaction trace on it. These are the general rules, but there are some agent-specific differences. For example: The Java agent collects occasional non-slow transactions. If one transaction is frequently traced, some agents will select other transactions to give a more diverse sampling. If you don't see traces in your account, it's possible that no transactions meet the necessary criteria. In this situation, you can adjust transaction trace settings to ensure some transactions will be traced. If you use Synthetic, you will likely have Synthetic monitor traces. Synthetic traces can happen more frequently than APM traces, potentially several per minute. Configure transaction traces To configure or edit trace settings, see the procedures for: Transaction traces Key transaction traces View transaction traces in UI To view transaction traces: Do one of the following: New Relic Explorer: Go to one.newrelic.com > Explorer > (select an app) > Monitor > Transactions. APM: Go to one.newrelic.com > APM > (select an app) > Monitor > Transactions. In the Transaction traces section, click transaction traces to view additional details. Troubleshoot an issue with transaction traces If you expect to see transaction traces but do not see them, follow the troubleshooting procedures.

Common database query setting changes include: Collecting raw query data instead of obfuscated or turning off query collection Changing the stack trace threshold Turning on query explain plan collection Use database queries to improve performance Here are some tips to improve your app's database performance: Use database queries Comments Time Look for queries where the TOTAL DURATION contributes large amounts of time to the overall transaction time. This indicates a good place to try to enhance your database query with an index or some other optimization. Duplicate queries Look for queries that repeatedly query the same kind of information; for example, multiple queries to look up individual account IDs. Try rewriting the query to INCLUDE the specific values (account IDs 1, 2, 10, 14, 17, etc.) so that a single query can get all the relevant items. Database overhead Look at the structure of your queries to see if there are opportunities to combine different types of information into a single call; for example, querying for the account ID, name, etc. This is useful, for example, if your database center is in a different geographical location, because this will reduce overhead. The amount of time for your database request and response may be very fast. However, by combining requests into fewer calls, you can reduce that time even more. MySQL From your app's main APM Summary page, compare the database time on the main chart to other processing time. Sudden spikes or larger amounts of database time compared to other processing times may indicate problems. Find other slow queries The Trace details page is useful for examining a specific transaction's details. To see all of your application's slowest queries in one place, use the Slow queries feature.",

      "body": "When we say auto-telemetry, we’re not talking about cars — we're talking about instant baseline visibility into your Kubernetes clusters. With the New Relic One integration with Pixie, you get similar data to traditional language agents, but without manually instrumenting your code or redeploying your application. Pixie auto-telemetry is powered by eBPF, a virtual machine-like construct that enables Pixie to seamlessly collect fine-grained telemetry data — service-level metrics, unsampled requests, and more. With one install command, you get deeper insight into your Kubernetes clusters and workloads. No language agents required. Live debugging with Pixie shows a service graph listing the namespaces and the node that are available on the current cluster. Simply put, Auto-telemetry with Pixie offers the quickest option for getting observability into your Kubernetes services. Quickly start observing and debugging Kubernetes clusters Our Pixie integration gives you the best of both worlds: Pixie’s fast and simple Kubernetes observability coupled with New Relic One’s incident correlation, intelligent alerting, and long-term retention. You’ll get visibility into HTTP services using golden signals, HTTP transactions, database transactions, distributed tracing, and JVM metrics. You can operate, debug, and scale your Kubernetes clusters based on the information you learn about how your clusters and services are running. Using the New Relic Explorer, you can see key metrics and events at every level, starting with the cluster, and diving down into namespaces, deployments, and pods. You can quickly spot anomalous behavior, and where it’s happening. And then dive deeper using embedded visualizations of your Pixie data. Quickly identify hot spots with Flamegraph. On the Live debugging with Pixie tab, answer questions like what SQL requests your app is making or which services are talking to each other. Important Auto-Telemetry with Pixie leverages Community Cloud with Pixie, a separate platform from New Relic One. Use of Community Cloud with Pixie is subject to separate terms of service. Explore your cluster Access the Pixie UI via New Relic's Live debugging with Pixie area of your Kubernetes clusters. The cluster explorer provides a quick overview of the nodes in your cluster, including CPU, memory, and storage, as well as the status of each pod (healthy, warning, or critical). You can also find out what services are running in each container, their latency, throughput, and error rate. For more information about using the cluster explorer, see Navigate the Kubernetes cluster explorer. Note that you cannot log directly into the Pixie UI unless you have created a separate Pixie login. Tip Containers might be listed for up to four hours after they get decommissioned. You can query the Pixie data in New Relic One and create dashboards for at-a-glance monitoring. Find the data model and sample queries here. Investigate usage spikes with Flamegraph Debugging is orders of magnitude easier when you can quickly see what your application is doing. Flamegraph, a Pixie always-on visualization, requires no instrumentation, redeploying, or recompiling. It works for compiled languages like Go, C+, Rust, to name a few. And at a glance, Flamegraph tells you what functions your application is spending time on and where you have hot spots. Flamegraph is especially useful for hierarchical resource use, like disk usage and CPU utilization. For more information on how to read Flamegraph, see the Pixie documentation. Debug live On the Live debugging with Pixie tab, run PxL scripts — scripts written in Pixie's PxL language — to view live data captured through eBPF. Select the script drop-down and then select a script to run in the tab. (For best results, select a time range that is recent in the time picker.) Scripts enable you to debug: Traffic in multiple formats: HTTP and HTTPs (including encrypted), DNS, Postgres, MySQL, Cassandra, Redis (currently supporting SQL and HTTP in beta).

      "body": "To get up and running with Auto-telemetry with Pixie, you start with our guided installation. The guided installation deploys Pixie with New Relic's Kubernetes integration on your cluster. You don't need to do any further configuration or installation to start using Pixie. If you want to install Auto-telemetry with Pixie on multiple clusters, re-run the guided install for each additional cluster. General prerequisites for using Pixie You must be a New Relic full platform user. Other user-related requirements: Users on our New Relic One user model must be assigned to a group that has a role with Pixie-related capabilities. Users on our original user model cannot be Restricted. Review this Pixie data security overview for actions to take to secure your data. Make sure you have sufficient memory: Pixie requires 2Gb of memory per node in your cluster. Review the other Pixie technical requirements. Setup steps depend on your account status Use the following table to find out where to start installing Auto-telemetry with Pixie. Where you start the installation depends on whether you already have a New Relic or Pixie account, or both. New Relic Pixie Next steps Start the guided install at the beginning of the process. If you already have both types of accounts, and used the same email address for each of them, click the New Relic icon in the Pixie UI. This brings you to the Configure the HELM command/manifest (yaml) file section of the guided installation. Then, follow the steps. If you're using different email addresses in Pixie and New Relic, create a new account for either Pixie or New Relic to match email addresses across both products. You can also contact New Relic support to manually link your existing New Relic account with your Pixie account. If you follow a link to New Relic from the Pixie UI and do not have a New Relic account, you must first create one. Click the New Relic icon in the Pixie UI, and follow the steps to create a New Relic account. When you do so, your Pixie account is linked to it. Then, continue the guided install process with these steps. Sign up for a free New Relic account. Then, start the guided install at the beginning of the process. Install from the beginning of the guided install process Open our New Relic One guided install. Select the account you want to use for the guided install, and click Continue. Note: if you have a single account, you won't see this option. Select Kubernetes and then continue with step one in the next section. Install from the Configure the HELM command/manifest (yaml) file If you arrived in the guided installation process by following a link from Pixie or from within New Relic, your steps begin here. Select the account and cluster for the install. If needed, select a namespace. Important Currently, Pixie performs best on clusters with up to 100 nodes (exceeding 100 nodes can lead to excessive memory usage and scripts failing to run). Friendly reminder: autoscaling can quickly drive up your node numbers. Click Continue. Select the data you want to gather, observe, and debug, and click Continue. On the Choose install method page, select either Helm or manifest. Helm method Run the provided Helm command on your command line. If you're concerned about the amount of Pixie data you'll ingest, find some parameters for reducing ingest below. Helm installs a bundle containing the New Relic infrastructure agent, an integration to gather Prometheus metrics and Kubernetes events, and the Pixie integration. The deployment takes a few minutes to complete. To see the status of the install to the cluster, run kubectl get pods -n newrelic. For general information about installing a Kubernetes integration, see this Helm install info. manifest method Run the provided command in your console, and insert the path to your downloaded manifest. If you're running your Kubernetes cluster in the cloud, see the additional steps in the Kubernetes docs. Click Continue to open the Listening for data page. When you get the message, See your data, click Kubernetes Cluster Explorer to see your cluster. Auto-telemetry with Pixie might restart after installation. This is caused by the auto update feature. If you link the wrong Pixie and New Relic account Contact support to unlink a Pixie account from your New Relic account. Be aware that if you unlink a Pixie account that was created automatically through the guided install, you'll lose access to that Pixie account. Reduce ingest during install with Helm If you want to reduce the amount of Pixie data that New Relic ingests, you can add the following parameters to your Helm chart during installation. Note that the data still exists in Pixie: excludeNamespacesRegex - use to identify the namespaces that you want to exclude from sending observability data to New Relic. If empty, data for all namespaces is sent to New Relic. Example: --set newrelic-pixie.excludeNamespacesRegex=\"examplenamespace-1|examplenamespace-2\" excludePodsRegex - use to identify pods across all namespaces that you want to exclude from sending observability data to New Relic. If empty, data for all pods (except those in excluded namespaces) is sent to New Relic. Example: --set newrelic-pixie.excludePodsRegex=\"examplepod-1|examplepod-2\" Learn more about the available parameters for the newrelic-pixie Helm chart here.",

Auto-telemetry with Pixie therefore benefits from Pixie's approach to keeping data secure. The data that Pixie collects is stored entirely within your Kubernetes cluster. This data does not persist outside of your environment, and will never be stored by Community Cloud for Pixie. This means that your sensitive data remains within your environment and control. Community Cloud for Pixie makes queries directly to your Kubernetes cluster to access the data. In order for the query results to be shown in the Community Cloud for Pixie UI, CLI, and API, the data is sent to the client from your cluster using a reverse proxy. Community Cloud for Pixie’s reverse proxy is designed to ensure: Data is ephemeral. It only passes through the Community Cloud for Pixie's cloud proxy in transit. This ensures data locality. Data is encrypted while in transit. Only you are able to read your data. New Relic One fetches and stores data that related to an application's performance. With Auto-telemetry with Pixie, a predefined subset of data persists outside of your cluster. This data is stored in Telemetry Data Platform, in the your selected region. This data persists in order to give you long-term storage, alerting, correlation with additional data, and the ability to use advanced New Relic platform capabilities, such as anomaly detection. The persisted performance metrics include, but are not limited to: Golden metrics (throughput, latency, error rate) for HTTP-based services HTTP transaction data Database transaction data (for MySQL & PostgreSQL) Distributed tracing JVM metrics The data you view on the Live debugging tab comes through Community Cloud for Pixie, and is therefore potentially sensitive. It is not stored by New Relic and is ephemeral and queryable for less than 24 hours. Control who has access to Pixie data If you want to manage which members of your organization can view Pixie data in New Relic One, as well as install and delete Pixie links, you can create a custom role. Note that this option is available only to Enterprise and Pro level customers. For more information, see New Relic's user model. Manage auto-update and two-way communication Pixie maintains an active two-way communication channel from your host system to Community Cloud with Pixie at withpixie.ai. Pixie uses this communication channel to query data, push updates, and retrieve metadata and health checks about Pixie and your Kubernetes cluster. By default, Pixie queries withpixie.ai to check if new updates have been pushed and then automatically installs them if they’re present. To disable auto updates, you must set a flag prior to the install process using either Helm or in the newrelic-manifest.yaml file. To disable automatic updates, choose one: Helm option Add --set pixie-chart.disableAutoUpdate=true to your Helm command. newrelic-manifest.yaml option in your newrelic-manifest.yaml file under the pl-cluster-config section, add PL_DISABLE_AUTO_UPDATE: \"true\" to the data directive.

      "body": "To get up and running with Auto-telemetry with Pixie, you start with our guided installation. The guided installation deploys Pixie with New Relic's Kubernetes integration on your cluster. You don't need to do any further configuration or installation to start using Pixie. If you want to install Auto-telemetry with Pixie on multiple clusters, re-run the guided install for each additional cluster. General prerequisites for using Pixie You must be a New Relic full platform user. Other user-related requirements: Users on our New Relic One user model must be assigned to a group that has a role with Pixie-related capabilities. Users on our original user model cannot be Restricted. Review this Pixie data security overview for actions to take to secure your data. Make sure you have sufficient memory: Pixie requires 2Gb of memory per node in your cluster. Review the other Pixie technical requirements. Setup steps depend on your account status Use the following table to find out where to start installing Auto-telemetry with Pixie. Where you start the installation depends on whether you already have a New Relic or Pixie account, or both. New Relic Pixie Next steps Start the guided install at the beginning of the process. If you already have both types of accounts, and used the same email address for each of them, click the New Relic icon in the Pixie UI. This brings you to the Configure the HELM command/manifest (yaml) file section of the guided installation. Then, follow the steps. If you're using different email addresses in Pixie and New Relic, create a new account for either Pixie or New Relic to match email addresses across both products. You can also contact New Relic support to manually link your existing New Relic account with your Pixie account. If you follow a link to New Relic from the Pixie UI and do not have a New Relic account, you must first create one. Click the New Relic icon in the Pixie UI, and follow the steps to create a New Relic account. When you do so, your Pixie account is linked to it. Then, continue the guided install process with these steps. Sign up for a free New Relic account. Then, start the guided install at the beginning of the process. Install from the beginning of the guided install process Open our New Relic One guided install. Select the account you want to use for the guided install, and click Continue. Note: if you have a single account, you won't see this option. Select Kubernetes and then continue with step one in the next section. Install from the Configure the HELM command/manifest (yaml) file If you arrived in the guided installation process by following a link from Pixie or from within New Relic, your steps begin here. Select the account and cluster for the install. If needed, select a namespace. Important Currently, Pixie performs best on clusters with up to 100 nodes (exceeding 100 nodes can lead to excessive memory usage and scripts failing to run). Friendly reminder: autoscaling can quickly drive up your node numbers. Click Continue. Select the data you want to gather, observe, and debug, and click Continue. On the Choose install method page, select either Helm or manifest. Helm method Run the provided Helm command on your command line. If you're concerned about the amount of Pixie data you'll ingest, find some parameters for reducing ingest below. Helm installs a bundle containing the New Relic infrastructure agent, an integration to gather Prometheus metrics and Kubernetes events, and the Pixie integration. The deployment takes a few minutes to complete. To see the status of the install to the cluster, run kubectl get pods -n newrelic. For general information about installing a Kubernetes integration, see this Helm install info. manifest method Run the provided command in your console, and insert the path to your downloaded manifest. If you're running your Kubernetes cluster in the cloud, see the additional steps in the Kubernetes docs. Click Continue to open the Listening for data page. When you get the message, See your data, click Kubernetes Cluster Explorer to see your cluster. Auto-telemetry with Pixie might restart after installation. This is caused by the auto update feature. If you link the wrong Pixie and New Relic account Contact support to unlink a Pixie account from your New Relic account. Be aware that if you unlink a Pixie account that was created automatically through the guided install, you'll lose access to that Pixie account. Reduce ingest during install with Helm If you want to reduce the amount of Pixie data that New Relic ingests, you can add the following parameters to your Helm chart during installation.

      "body": "When we say auto-telemetry, we’re not talking about cars — we're talking about instant baseline visibility into your Kubernetes clusters. With the New Relic One integration with Pixie, you get similar data to traditional language agents, but without manually instrumenting your code or redeploying your application. Pixie auto-telemetry is powered by eBPF, a virtual machine-like construct that enables Pixie to seamlessly collect fine-grained telemetry data — service-level metrics, unsampled requests, and more. With one install command, you get deeper insight into your Kubernetes clusters and workloads. No language agents required. Live debugging with Pixie shows a service graph listing the namespaces and the node that are available on the current cluster. Simply put, Auto-telemetry with Pixie offers the quickest option for getting observability into your Kubernetes services. Quickly start observing and debugging Kubernetes clusters Our Pixie integration gives you the best of both worlds: Pixie’s fast and simple Kubernetes observability coupled with New Relic One’s incident correlation, intelligent alerting, and long-term retention. You’ll get visibility into HTTP services using golden signals, HTTP transactions, database transactions, distributed tracing, and JVM metrics. You can operate, debug, and scale your Kubernetes clusters based on the information you learn about how your clusters and services are running. Using the New Relic Explorer, you can see key metrics and events at every level, starting with the cluster, and diving down into namespaces, deployments, and pods. You can quickly spot anomalous behavior, and where it’s happening. And then dive deeper using embedded visualizations of your Pixie data. Quickly identify hot spots with Flamegraph. On the Live debugging with Pixie tab, answer questions like what SQL requests your app is making or which services are talking to each other. Important Auto-Telemetry with Pixie leverages Community Cloud with Pixie, a separate platform from New Relic One. Use of Community Cloud with Pixie is subject to separate terms of service. Explore your cluster Access the Pixie UI via New Relic's Live debugging with Pixie area of your Kubernetes clusters. The cluster explorer provides a quick overview of the nodes in your cluster, including CPU, memory, and storage, as well as the status of each pod (healthy, warning, or critical). You can also find out what services are running in each container, their latency, throughput, and error rate. For more information about using the cluster explorer, see Navigate the Kubernetes cluster explorer. Note that you cannot log directly into the Pixie UI unless you have created a separate Pixie login. Tip Containers might be listed for up to four hours after they get decommissioned. You can query the Pixie data in New Relic One and create dashboards for at-a-glance monitoring. Find the data model and sample queries here. Investigate usage spikes with Flamegraph Debugging is orders of magnitude easier when you can quickly see what your application is doing. Flamegraph, a Pixie always-on visualization, requires no instrumentation, redeploying, or recompiling. It works for compiled languages like Go, C+, Rust, to name a few. And at a glance, Flamegraph tells you what functions your application is spending time on and where you have hot spots. Flamegraph is especially useful for hierarchical resource use, like disk usage and CPU utilization. For more information on how to read Flamegraph, see the Pixie documentation. Debug live On the Live debugging with Pixie tab, run PxL scripts — scripts written in Pixie's PxL language — to view live data captured through eBPF. Select the script drop-down and then select a script to run in the tab. (For best results, select a time range that is recent in the time picker.) Scripts enable you to debug: Traffic in multiple formats: HTTP and HTTPs (including encrypted), DNS, Postgres, MySQL, Cassandra, Redis (currently supporting SQL and HTTP in beta).

      "body": "Auto-telemetry with Pixie is New Relic One's integration of Community Cloud for Pixie, a managed version of Pixie open source software. Auto-telemetry with Pixie therefore benefits from Pixie's approach to keeping data secure. The data that Pixie collects is stored entirely within your Kubernetes cluster. This data does not persist outside of your environment, and will never be stored by Community Cloud for Pixie. This means that your sensitive data remains within your environment and control. Community Cloud for Pixie makes queries directly to your Kubernetes cluster to access the data. In order for the query results to be shown in the Community Cloud for Pixie UI, CLI, and API, the data is sent to the client from your cluster using a reverse proxy. Community Cloud for Pixie’s reverse proxy is designed to ensure: Data is ephemeral. It only passes through the Community Cloud for Pixie's cloud proxy in transit. This ensures data locality. Data is encrypted while in transit. Only you are able to read your data. New Relic One fetches and stores data that related to an application's performance. With Auto-telemetry with Pixie, a predefined subset of data persists outside of your cluster. This data is stored in Telemetry Data Platform, in the your selected region. This data persists in order to give you long-term storage, alerting, correlation with additional data, and the ability to use advanced New Relic platform capabilities, such as anomaly detection. The persisted performance metrics include, but are not limited to: Golden metrics (throughput, latency, error rate) for HTTP-based services HTTP transaction data Database transaction data (for MySQL & PostgreSQL) Distributed tracing JVM metrics The data you view on the Live debugging tab comes through Community Cloud for Pixie, and is therefore potentially sensitive. It is not stored by New Relic and is ephemeral and queryable for less than 24 hours. Control who has access to Pixie data If you want to manage which members of your organization can view Pixie data in New Relic One, as well as install and delete Pixie links, you can create a custom role. Note that this option is available only to Enterprise and Pro level customers. For more information, see New Relic's user model. Manage auto-update and two-way communication Pixie maintains an active two-way communication channel from your host system to Community Cloud with Pixie at withpixie.ai. Pixie uses this communication channel to query data, push updates, and retrieve metadata and health checks about Pixie and your Kubernetes cluster. By default, Pixie queries withpixie.ai to check if new updates have been pushed and then automatically installs them if they’re present. To disable auto updates, you must set a flag prior to the install process using either Helm or in the newrelic-manifest.yaml file. To disable automatic updates, choose one: Helm option Add --set pixie-chart.disableAutoUpdate=true to your Helm command. newrelic-manifest.yaml option in your newrelic-manifest.yaml file under the pl-cluster-config section, add PL_DISABLE_AUTO_UPDATE: \"true\" to the data directive.

With the New Relic One integration with Pixie, you get similar data to traditional language agents, but without manually instrumenting your code or redeploying your application. Pixie auto-telemetry is powered by eBPF, a virtual machine-like construct that enables Pixie to seamlessly collect fine-grained telemetry data — service-level metrics, unsampled requests, and more. With one install command, you get deeper insight into your Kubernetes clusters and workloads. No language agents required. Live debugging with Pixie shows a service graph listing the namespaces and the node that are available on the current cluster. Simply put, Auto-telemetry with Pixie offers the quickest option for getting observability into your Kubernetes services. Quickly start observing and debugging Kubernetes clusters Our Pixie integration gives you the best of both worlds: Pixie’s fast and simple Kubernetes observability coupled with New Relic One’s incident correlation, intelligent alerting, and long-term retention. You’ll get visibility into HTTP services using golden signals, HTTP transactions, database transactions, distributed tracing, and JVM metrics. You can operate, debug, and scale your Kubernetes clusters based on the information you learn about how your clusters and services are running.

      "body": "To get up and running with Auto-telemetry with Pixie, you start with our guided installation. The guided installation deploys Pixie with New Relic's Kubernetes integration on your cluster. You don't need to do any further configuration or installation to start using Pixie. If you want to install Auto-telemetry with Pixie on multiple clusters, re-run the guided install for each additional cluster. General prerequisites for using Pixie You must be a New Relic full platform user. Other user-related requirements: Users on our New Relic One user model must be assigned to a group that has a role with Pixie-related capabilities. Users on our original user model cannot be Restricted. Review this Pixie data security overview for actions to take to secure your data. Make sure you have sufficient memory: Pixie requires 2Gb of memory per node in your cluster. Review the other Pixie technical requirements. Setup steps depend on your account status Use the following table to find out where to start installing Auto-telemetry with Pixie. Where you start the installation depends on whether you already have a New Relic or Pixie account, or both. New Relic Pixie Next steps Start the guided install at the beginning of the process. If you already have both types of accounts, and used the same email address for each of them, click the New Relic icon in the Pixie UI. This brings you to the Configure the HELM command/manifest (yaml) file section of the guided installation. Then, follow the steps. If you're using different email addresses in Pixie and New Relic, create a new account for either Pixie or New Relic to match email addresses across both products. You can also contact New Relic support to manually link your existing New Relic account with your Pixie account. If you follow a link to New Relic from the Pixie UI and do not have a New Relic account, you must first create one. Click the New Relic icon in the Pixie UI, and follow the steps to create a New Relic account. When you do so, your Pixie account is linked to it. Then, continue the guided install process with these steps. Sign up for a free New Relic account. Then, start the guided install at the beginning of the process. Install from the beginning of the guided install process Open our New Relic One guided install. Select the account you want to use for the guided install, and click Continue. Note: if you have a single account, you won't see this option. Select Kubernetes and then continue with step one in the next section. Install from the Configure the HELM command/manifest (yaml) file If you arrived in the guided installation process by following a link from Pixie or from within New Relic, your steps begin here. Select the account and cluster for the install. If needed, select a namespace. Important Currently, Pixie performs best on clusters with up to 100 nodes (exceeding 100 nodes can lead to excessive memory usage and scripts failing to run). Friendly reminder: autoscaling can quickly drive up your node numbers. Click Continue. Select the data you want to gather, observe, and debug, and click Continue. On the Choose install method page, select either Helm or manifest. Helm method Run the provided Helm command on your command line. If you're concerned about the amount of Pixie data you'll ingest, find some parameters for reducing ingest below. Helm installs a bundle containing the New Relic infrastructure agent, an integration to gather Prometheus metrics and Kubernetes events, and the Pixie integration. The deployment takes a few minutes to complete. To see the status of the install to the cluster, run kubectl get pods -n newrelic. For general information about installing a Kubernetes integration, see this Helm install info. manifest method Run the provided command in your console, and insert the path to your downloaded manifest. If you're running your Kubernetes cluster in the cloud, see the additional steps in the Kubernetes docs. Click Continue to open the Listening for data page. When you get the message, See your data, click Kubernetes Cluster Explorer to see your cluster. Auto-telemetry with Pixie might restart after installation. This is caused by the auto update feature. If you link the wrong Pixie and New Relic account Contact support to unlink a Pixie account from your New Relic account. Be aware that if you unlink a Pixie account that was created automatically through the guided install, you'll lose access to that Pixie account. Reduce ingest during install with Helm If you want to reduce the amount of Pixie data that New Relic ingests, you can add the following parameters to your Helm chart during installation. Note that the data still exists in Pixie: excludeNamespacesRegex - use to identify the namespaces that you want to exclude from sending observability data to New Relic. If empty, data for all namespaces is sent to New Relic. Example: --set newrelic-pixie.excludeNamespacesRegex=\"examplenamespace-1|examplenamespace-2\" excludePodsRegex - use to identify pods across all namespaces that you want to exclude from sending observability data to New Relic. If empty, data for all pods (except those in excluded namespaces) is sent to New Relic. Example: --set newrelic-pixie.excludePodsRegex=\"examplepod-1|examplepod-2\" Learn more about the available parameters for the newrelic-pixie Helm chart here.",

DistributedTraceSummary MobileRequest MobileRequestError Span Transaction TransactionError InfrastructureEvent Data sources : InfrastructureCloudTrail InfrastructureEvent describes changes (deltas) that occur in a system's live state. When an inventory or system state is added, removed, or changed, Infrastructure will produce an InfrastructureEvent that logs that activity. Attribute name Definition Data types category A New Relic category used to organize events in the UI. For example: automation, notification, and service. InfrastructureEvent changeType A simple classification of the type of change made to the entity: added, modified, or removed. InfrastructureEvent changedPath The fully specified name of the item that changed. This is constructed by taking the source and adding one or more additional path elements that uniquely identify the item that changed. InfrastructureEvent deltaId Delta refers to a recorded change in the system. The deltaId is a number used by New Relic to organize incoming inventory change data. InfrastructureEvent eventId The unique ID of the event, generated by New Relic. InfrastructureEvent format The type of infrastructure event. Each format type includes attributes that may be used to render the event in the UI. InfrastructureEvent newStatus The new agent status: disconnected or connected. InfrastructureEvent newValue If a change is made to the entity, this attribute contains the new value of the inventory that was changed. This will have no value if no change has been made. The value will display approximately 4K bytes of data. InfrastructureEvent oldValue If a change is made to the entity, this attribute contains the old value of the inventory that was changed. This will be blank if no change has been made. InfrastructureEvent provider For integrations that use generic event types (like the DatastoreSample event), the provider value specifies the source of the data (the service, or a sub-category of data from that service). Some Insights events are generic and are used by several integrations. For example, the DatastoreSample event is used by several integrations, including the AWS DynamoDB integration and the AWS RDS integration. In these cases, the provider attribute value represents the source of that attribute. This will usually be the service that data comes from or, for integrations that use several provider values, a certain sub-category of data from that service. When a provider value is present for a generic event, that event will have additional integration-specific attributes attached to it. Here’s an example of an Insights NRQL query that returns the attributes present for a DatastoreSample event reported by the AWS RDS integration: SELECT * from DatastoreSample where provider = 'RdsDbCluster' InfrastructureEvent source The fully specified origin of this inventory item. This is typically in the form category/plugin, where plugin is the generic word used for the tool that gathered this data. InfrastructureEvent summary A summary of the change that happened. Uses a human-friendly string, such as Agent disconnected. InfrastructureEvent violationUpdateType The type of change to the violation: For example: open or closed.

      "body": "Browser monitoring's session traces provide a detailed timeline of the load and interaction events during a webpage's full life cycle, for as long as ten minutes. Page load timing, individual asset loads, user interactions, AJAX requests, callbacks, errors, and other events appear in an interactive timeline which includes a detailed waterfall visualization, a heat map overview, and highlighted metrics and problems related to that session. Identify problems and solutions Session traces help you understand: How users experience your page load, including time to DOM load, time waiting for AJAX requests to complete, and the user's interactions with the page How the New Relic metrics reflect your end users' experiences What is the sequence of JavaScript and browser events, which take longer than others, and when each event occurs Where bottlenecks occur, and what may be causing them Why one page load may be slower than others, by providing the context for individual events during a session By connecting performance to user experience and interactions to performance, this detailed and intuitive visualization of all events in the user's session can help pinpoint problem areas and easily identify solutions. Requirements To use browser session traces feature, make sure you meet these requirements: Requires the Pro or Pro+SPA agent type Your agent version must support browser monitoring. If you're using multiple names for an app, session traces will only report to the most specific application. Browser randomly captures traces only from browsers that support the Resource Timing API. Select a session trace The Session traces index lists the most recent traces based on the time picker selection for the selected app. Session traces are randomly sampled and stored at a rate of 90/hour. You can page through up to 500 traces at a time. Additionally, you can sort and search the list by attributes, including: Full URL, with query string parameters removed Browser type Started at date/time Page load time one.newrelic.com > Browser > (select an app) > Session traces: You can select a session trace from the browser index. You can also select a session trace directly from the browser Summary, Page views, JS errors, and AJAX pages. To select a specific session trace: Go to one.newrelic.com and click Browser > (select an app) > Session traces. To locate a session trace from a different date or time period, use the time picker. To limit the index to a specific type of trace, use the search window. To view detailed information, select the session trace's link. Tip You can also select a session trace directly from the Browser Summary, Page views, JS errors and AJAX pages. View session trace details The Session trace details page provides summary information about the trace, a heat map with timing details, and a waterfall of events that you can explore. The color-coded legend identifies the page load events during the webpage's life cycle. For apps that have been deployed using the copy/paste method, browser monitoring includes web app and queue time in Network time as part of the page load timing process. This is because browser relies on the server-side agent to pass the application values to the browser agent through auto-injection. You can view detailed information about how this \"back end\" time breaks down from the browser's point of view. The session traces report on all the network related events available, so you can see on a case-by-case basis how the browser spends time on DNS lookups and other network events. one.newrelic.com > Browser > (select an app) > Session traces > (select a trace): Use Browser's session trace details to examine events and identify problems during the end user's webpage session. To navigate through a session trace, explore the waterfall chart by scrolling vertically through the event stack, or select individual events to view their details. If you want to... Do this... View the web page for this session trace Select the trace link. Jump to a specific time Select the time indicator or event on the heat map. View details about individual events Select any event in the waterfall chart. From there, select View full details if applicable. Change the location on the session trace Click on the heat map, or scroll vertically through the waterfall chart. Zoom in or out of the overall trace Select the plus or minus icons below the heat map. Share the session trace information Create a permalink to paste into a form, ticket, email, etc. Session segment definitions Important session trace measurements are displayed in the upper right corner of the Session traces page. The first four measurements represent how long into a session that the segment ended. For example, if Page Load is 0.202s, that means that the page load event completed 0.202 seconds after the request began. Session segment Description Backend The time from when the request began to when backend activity finished and DOM loading began. DOM processing The time from when the request began to when DOM processing finished. Page load The time from when the request began to when the page load event fired. Waiting on AJAX The time from when the request began to when AJAX activity ended. First interaction The time from when the request began to when the first user activity, like a mouse click or a scroll, was recorded. Duration The total duration of the session. Slow JavaScript execution and repainting Session traces help you identify callbacks in your JavaScript code that execute slowly and block the execution of subsequent calls on the browser's main thread. These calls should execute quickly in order to allow the browser to quickly repaint the page in response to user actions. Session traces highlight any callbacks longer than 33ms. If called in rapid succession (such as inside a requestAnimationFrame loop), callbacks longer than 33ms reduce the frame rate below 30 frames per second. This speed seems sluggish to users.",

      "body": "Browser monitoring's JavaScript snippet introduces a nearly invisible impact on website performance and user perception of the time it takes a page to load. The JavaScript is included in a packet of webpage data that is sent anyway. In addition, it immediately begins monitoring for errors and events as the rest of the webpage executes. The negligible amount of overhead required to load the JavaScript results in a significant return of actionable data. Contents Overall impact The JavaScript's overhead takes into consideration both the impact on the user and the impact on your systems' performance: User perception: Typically users cannot detect performance degradations on a website of less than 200ms. Browser's JavaScript adds less than 15ms in aggregated time per page load. This is split up over time, so at no point would a user be able to perceive any performance impact due to the JavaScript. Webserver and systems: Browser app monitoring occurs on the user's browser, not on the server. Processing time does not have an impact on your CPU consumption. In addition, we take additional steps to minimize any potential impact on the apps and webpages being monitored. For example, the \"loader\" script is loaded synchronously in the <HEAD> in order to ensure monitoring is enabled for the entire life cycle of the page. This script is included inline, which eliminates the need for another roundtrip network request to a content delivery network (CDN). The \"loader\" comes with the initial page load. Later in the life cycle of the page, New Relic loads an additional monitoring script asynchronously. This script should not have any perceivable effect to the user and is included in the overall overhead of less than 15ms per page. Network impact Browser monitoring also minimizes network traffic for the end user by aggregating data locally (in the client) and sending it back to New Relic on load, at periodic intervals, on unload, or when data has been collected. (During the browser session's idle periods, transmissions may not be required.) For more help Additional documentation resources include: Instrumentation for page load timing (JavaScript elements, data transmission) Browser monitoring and search engine optimization (how browser ensures that the JavaScript has a negligible impact on SEO)",

      "body": "Your end-user experience depends on your entire technology stack. You need to quickly understand what's causing a customer complaint or issue. Did the problem come from your infrastructure, your application, or the browsers that ultimately render it? Is it the result of a problematic internet provider, a problem in your own data center with failing CPU or memory, or something else? More than Real User Monitoring (RUM) Many websites contain dynamic content that is loaded after the initial page has finished loading, and complex JavaScript code increases the need for error reporting. Browser monitoring in New Relic One provides a Real User Monitoring (RUM) solution that measures the speed and performance of your end users as they navigate to your site from different web browsers, devices, operating systems, and networks. With browser monitoring in New Relic One, you see actionable data about your end users' experience with your app. But browser monitoring in New Relic goes far beyond the initial page load to measure full page life cycle data. For example, our browser UI shows you: Actual performance data, such as by page view popularity and user satisfaction (Apdex) scores Perceived performance data that measures how quickly your async or dynamic visuals and interactive page contents display JavaScript error analytics, stack traces, and line-of-code visibility, to show you the end-user steps leading up to an error itself Session performance with a detailed timeline and heat map of the load and interaction events during a webpage's full life cycle AJAX requests indicating problems with timing, end points, and specific locations in the webpage Hash-based route changes in apps with single-page application (SPA) architectures These tools (and more!) help your teams optimize your end users' page load experience, eliminate bugs, and troubleshoot faster across your full stack. Examine user perceptions Real user data gives insights into actual page performance, but you also need to look into your users' perception of your site's performance. Pages can load content in many different ways, and users control when they interact with that content. This is why some user-centric performance metrics happen outside the standard window onload (page load time) in the browser monitoring agent. The PageViewTiming event provides a more real-time delivery mechanism that does not have a dependency on any other event. Additional metrics include: First paint, first contentful paint, and largest contentful paint First input delay First interaction This helps you understand how users experience your site, both from visual and responsiveness standpoints. Improve interactive app performance Our single-page app (SPA) monitoring automatically tracks route changes, initial page loads, and synchronous and asynchronous activity during browser interactions. You can also use our browser agent and SPA API to monitor virtually anything that executes inside the browser. If you are a developer, SPA monitoring can help you: Create faster, more responsive, highly interactive apps. Monitor the throughput and performance that real users are experiencing. Troubleshoot and resolve problems within the context of the page load. Query and visualize the data to assist with business decisions. Bring better apps to the marketplace more quickly. Correlate front-end and back-end problems With New Relic One, you can instrument any type of data you need, such as metrics, events, logs, and traces. This helps you find actionable data about your end users' experience across the stack. For example: Full-Stack Observability Comments Locations or domains Limit browser monitoring to focus on specific geographical locations or specific types of end-user activity. You can also monitor or block specific domains. Trends in interactions Use our comparative charting feature for a direct page load time comparison between real user (browser) interactions and trends appearing in Synthetic monitors. Distributed tracing Isolate latency from the web browser through back-end services with distributed tracing. The UI helps you see the connection across across a full transaction, from browser activity, to time spent in network, to back-end activity. Browser types Explore your end users' experience with your app segmented by any types of browsers they use, including: Top browsers by throughput Average page load time by platform type (mobile, desktop, and other) Selected browser type by version (for example, Chrome 31, 32, 33, etc.) This helps you quickly determine whether problems with page load timing may be related to a specific browser type or platform, or whether the problem is more widespread. Get started with browser monitoring Follow these basic steps, and you'll quickly be up and running in New Relic with browser monitoring! Review the compatibility details and basic requirements for browser monitoring. Install the browser agent. Go to [one.newrelic.com > Explorer > Browser applications. Use the Explorer to access all your entities, that is, anything we can identify that reports data, from applications and hosts to custom groupings of any elements. View summary data from your Browser summary page, then drill down into page load timing details and other UI data. Configure your alerts for key performance data, or use our Applied Intelligence solutions to reduce alert noise, correlate incidents, and automatically detect anomalies. Query and visualize your default data (or customize your own), then analyze what that data says about your business. Customize and share your own charts and dashboards.",

      "body": "Browser monitoring supports the uploading of source maps, which are used to un-minify error stack traces on the JS errors page. This document explains how to use the API to publish (upload) source maps to browser. Prepare for using the source map API In order to upload source maps to browser via the API, you'll need this information: A user API key (before November 20, 2020, the Admin API key was required; that will still work if already in place) The New Relic application ID for the deployed app The full JavaScript file URL Optionally, if the JavaScript URL doesn't automatically have release info appended to it, the release name and ID What is the JavaScript URL? Every time the agent captures an error in your code, it's associated with the URL of the JavaScript in which it occurred. This is the src attribute of the script tag in your HTML. This full JavaScript URL is required when sending source maps to browser. You can find the URL for an error's JavaScript file in browser, on the JS errors page. See Browser monitoring source maps for more on finding these errors in the UI. Is a release name and ID required? Many organizations include a version number or hash in the JavaScript URL. This is generally added to \"bust\" caches to ensure your users get the most recent version of your code. This type of URL might look something like: https://example.com/assets/application-59.min.js https://example.com/assets/bundle-d6d031.min.js https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/jquery/3.1.1/jquery.js If your app's URLs automatically have the version info appended to it, the browser agent has everything it needs in order to match errors with your code. You can move ahead to generating source maps. If this doesn't apply to you, and JS URLs do not have version info appended, you’ll have to assist the agent by specifying a release name and ID with the API. Are there limits to source map uploads? There is no limit to the overall number of source maps you can upload. However, the API is rate-limited: You can upload a maximum of 100 source maps per minute You can upload a maximum of 5,000 source maps per day Source map files can be a maximum of 50Mb in size. Push source maps to New Relic Now that you have one or more source maps, you are ready to publish it to browser. You can use any of these methods to send source maps to browser: Use the New Relic npm module with the API via the command line or via a client-side JavaScript build/deploy script like Gulp or Grunt. Use API curl commands. Use the browser UI. Use npm module via command line or client-side script The easiest and recommended way to upload source maps to browser is to use the our new @newrelic/publish-sourcemap npm module. It provides a command line tool and Javascript API to accomplish this task. More documentation is available in the npm repo. Here are some examples of using the npm module via the command line. Important The following examples are for US accounts. For EU accounts, the endpoint is https://sourcemaps.service.eu.newrelic.com. For more information, see Introduction to the EU region data center. npm command line: Publish Here's an example of uploading source maps using the npm module via the command line.

Use API via curl Below are some examples of using curl to publish, list, and delete source maps: curl: Upload maps An example of using API via curl to publish maps to browser: curl -H \"Api-Key: YOUR_NEW_RELIC_USER_API_KEY\" \\ -F \"sourcemap=@SOURCE_MAP_PATH\" \\ -F \"javascriptUrl=JS_URL\" \\ -F \"releaseId=YOUR_RELEASE_ID\" \\ -F \"releaseName=YOUR_UI_PAGE\" \\ https://sourcemaps.service.newrelic.com/v2/applications/YOUR_NEW_RELIC_APP_ID/sourcemaps Copy curl: List existing maps Below is an example of how to get a list of source maps previously uploaded to New Relic via curl. New Relic returns the source map's unique SOURCEMAP_ID and its components: curl \\ -H \"Api-Key: YOUR_NEW_RELIC_USER_API_KEY\" \\ https://sourcemaps.service.newrelic.com/v2/applications/YOUR_NEW_RELIC_APP_ID/sourcemaps Copy curl: Delete map To delete a source map: Use the GET endpoint to list existing source maps and locate the SOURCEMAP_ID. Run the following command via curl: curl -X DELETE \\ -H \"Api-Key: YOUR_NEW_RELIC_USER_API_KEY\" \\ https://sourcemaps.service.newrelic.com/v2/applications/YOUR_NEW_RELIC_APP_ID/sourcemaps/SOURCEMAP_ID Copy When you're done, go to the JS errors page in browser, select an error grouping, and see if your error stack traces have been un-minified. Troubleshoot source maps If you are having trouble generating source maps from your build system, or if your errors in browser are remaining minified, see the source maps troubleshooting documentation.",

Rename app monitored by APM If you added an app to browser already being monitored by APM, the app name that appears in browser is the same as the app name in the APM UI. To rename the app, use any of these options: Option Comments Rename and continue collecting data This option is useful when you simply want to give an app a different display name (alias). To change the alias that appears in the New Relic UI, use the app's Settings page: Go to one.newrelic.com > APM > (select an app) > Settings > Application. Stop reporting under the old name To stop reporting data under the old name and begin collecting data with a new name (app identifer), use the APM agent's configuration file. This changes the identifier that New Relic's data collector uses to distinguish one app from another. Based on the data retention schedule, New Relic will retain historical data collected under the old name, and will collect and aggregate data under the new name. If one or more apps share the same name, then their data will be aggregated in the UI. Caution If you change the app identifier, a new application will appear in our user interface with the new name, and data will stop reporting to the app(s) with the old name. Rename app via JavaScript snippet This information applies if you inserted the browser agent's JavaScript snippet into your: App monitored by APM that was deployed via the copy/paste method Single page app (SPA) Any standalone browser app that is not also monitored by APM You cannot directly edit the JavaScript snippet in the existing app. Instead, to use your app with a different name: Follow standard procedures to create a new app using the copy/paste method. Provide the new name, and generate the JavaScript snippet. Copy the new JavaScript snippet. In your webpage, replace the JavaScript from your original app with the JavaScript generated for the new app name. If your standalone app has multiple names, copy the custom app IDs in your configuration script to your new app. Based on the data retention schedule, New Relic will retain historical data collected under the old name, and will collect and aggregate data under the new name. Rename app via New Relic REST API (v2) This information applies only to browser apps that are also monitored by APM. You cannot change the app name via the REST API if you used the copy/paste method to insert browser's JavaScript snippet into your app. Follow standard procedures to change the APM app alias via REST API or API Explorer.

      "body": "Browser monitoring includes strict security measures to provide a robust, standalone product with browser monitoring features. Before you install the browser agent, make sure your system meets these requirements. Want to try out our browser monitoring? Create a New Relic account for free! No credit card required. Basic requirements To report data to browser, your application must at a minimum meet two basic requirements: The traffic to the application must be from clients able to load and execute browser JavaScript code and set cookies. Clients accessing the application must be able to send data to New Relic through HTTP requests. HTTPS is required for browser Pro features. Important Browsers that subscribe to a disconnect list or that use content filtering extensions such as AdBlock may not be able to send data to New Relic. For example, if you are using the Enhanced Tracking Prevention disconnect list for Mozilla Firefox 69.0 or higher, you will need to change the default configuration. Most typical browser applications meet these requirements. However, browser applications in restricted environments may have difficulty reporting data to New Relic; for example: Hybrid mobile applications Applications installed on unusual hardware, such as point-of-sale terminals or consumer appliances For more information, review the instrumentation for browser monitoring documentation, and verify end-user network access. Browser types Instrumentation is compatible with every browser type, including Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox, Microsoft Internet Explorer and Edge, and Apple Safari. The user interface is compatible with New Relic's supported browser versions. Exceptions Comments Paint timings The firstPaint and firstContentfulPaint attributes in BrowserInteraction, PageView, and PageViewTiming events are only compatible with: Chrome 60 or higher for desktop and mobile (Android webview and Chrome for Android) Opera 47 or higher for desktop Opera 44 or higher for Android mobile Samsung Internet for mobile AJAX AJAX timing features are not available with: Chrome for iPhone and iPad IE 7 and 8 PageAction events PageAction events require a browser that fully supports cross-domain XMLHttpRequests. Internet Explorer versions 9 and lower cannot record PageAction events. Learn more on querying your data. Session traces Session traces are reported only from browsers that support the Resource Timing Specification. SHA-256 New Relic can only monitor browsers that are compatible with SHA-256. APM agents You can deploy the browser agent for apps monitored by APM, or you can deploy the browser agent for your standalone apps. For more information, see the installation procedures. If you are deploying browser for an app using APM, make sure your agent supports browser monitoring: C SDK: Version 1.0.0 or higher Go: Version 2.5.0 or higher Java: Version 3.4.0 or higher .NET: Version 2.20.25.0 or higher Node.js: Version 1.4.0 or higher PHP: Version 4.4.5.35 or higher Python: Version 2.10.1.9 or higher Ruby: Version 3.7.0.177 or higher Supported frameworks The browser agent collects data on all front-end frameworks. However, the monitoring occurs on lower-level \"primitives\" that JavaScript frameworks use, so the level of detail collected by the instrumentation may vary depending on your specific framework. Exceptions Comments Zone.js If you're using AngularJS and you want to use our SPA monitoring features, note that Zone.js versions 0.6.18 to 0.6.24 are not compatible with browser. In all cases, the browser agent must be loaded before Zone.js to avoid errors. Cypress.io Browser is unable to properly instrument the open and send methods of requests when tests are run in Cypress. This will cause the following error to be thrown: Cannot set property 'status' of undefined Copy This will only affect customers running tests with the Browser agent present in their code. Production applications should not be affected. html2pdf.js This library is not compatible with our Pro+SPA agent due to the way this library wraps promises. If you're using this library, we recommend selecting the Pro agent type. Content Security Policy (CSP) considerations In order to obtain accurate browser performance metrics, browser requires the use of a small, inline JavaScript snippet. New Relic carefully reviews the inline JavaScript to prevent Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) and other potential vulnerabilities. Content Security Policy Level 2 adds restrictions to the types of JavaScript allowed, such as inline scripts. It also limits which domains can load scripts during page load. Important If your website does not allow any third-party hosted JavaScript to run, you must request a CSP exception via your organization’s standard procedures in order to install the browser monitoring agent. When requesting a CSP exception, follow your organization's standard procedures to contact your web or security team. The browser JavaScript agent requires the following CSP exceptions in order to run properly. Alternatively, you can add all of these exceptions to the fallback default-src directive (instead of script-src and connect-src). CSP exception Comments unsafe-inline Add to the script-src directive or to the fallback default-src directive. This is required because the agent is installed by including an inline script. https://js-agent.newrelic.com Add to the script-src directive or to the fallback default-src directive. This is where additional script files that the agent requires are hosted. https://bam.nr-data.net https://bam-cell.nr-data.net Important Add https://gov-bam.nr-data.net if you're using FedRAMP-compliant endpoints. Add to the script-src directive or to the fallback default-src directive. This is where the agent sends its collected data. One of the calls to this URL is a JSONP call, which means that the URL must be allowed as a script source. Add to the connect-src directive or to the fallback default-src directive. The connect-src directive affects the URLs that scripts can call (for example, using the XMLHttpRequest interface). If you have CSP restrictions specifically around this directive, then add this URL as an exception.",

Did the problem come from your infrastructure, your application, or the browsers that ultimately render it? Is it the result of a problematic internet provider, a problem in your own data center with failing CPU or memory, or something else? More than Real User Monitoring (RUM) Many websites contain dynamic content that is loaded after the initial page has finished loading, and complex JavaScript code increases the need for error reporting. Browser monitoring in New Relic One provides a Real User Monitoring (RUM) solution that measures the speed and performance of your end users as they navigate to your site from different web browsers, devices, operating systems, and networks. With browser monitoring in New Relic One, you see actionable data about your end users' experience with your app. But browser monitoring in New Relic goes far beyond the initial page load to measure full page life cycle data. For example, our browser UI shows you: Actual performance data, such as by page view popularity and user satisfaction (Apdex) scores Perceived performance data that measures how quickly your async or dynamic visuals and interactive page contents display JavaScript error analytics, stack traces, and line-of-code visibility, to show you the end-user steps leading up to an error itself Session performance with a detailed timeline and heat map of the load and interaction events during a webpage's full life cycle AJAX requests indicating problems with timing, end points, and specific locations in the webpage Hash-based route changes in apps with single-page application (SPA) architectures These tools (and more!) help your teams optimize your end users' page load experience, eliminate bugs, and troubleshoot faster across your full stack. Examine user perceptions Real user data gives insights into actual page performance, but you also need to look into your users' perception of your site's performance. Pages can load content in many different ways, and users control when they interact with that content. This is why some user-centric performance metrics happen outside the standard window onload (page load time) in the browser monitoring agent. The PageViewTiming event provides a more real-time delivery mechanism that does not have a dependency on any other event. Additional metrics include: First paint, first contentful paint, and largest contentful paint First input delay First interaction This helps you understand how users experience your site, both from visual and responsiveness standpoints. Improve interactive app performance Our single-page app (SPA) monitoring automatically tracks route changes, initial page loads, and synchronous and asynchronous activity during browser interactions. You can also use our browser agent and SPA API to monitor virtually anything that executes inside the browser. If you are a developer, SPA monitoring can help you: Create faster, more responsive, highly interactive apps. Monitor the throughput and performance that real users are experiencing. Troubleshoot and resolve problems within the context of the page load. Query and visualize the data to assist with business decisions. Bring better apps to the marketplace more quickly. Correlate front-end and back-end problems With New Relic One, you can instrument any type of data you need, such as metrics, events, logs, and traces. This helps you find actionable data about your end users' experience across the stack. For example: Full-Stack Observability Comments Locations or domains Limit browser monitoring to focus on specific geographical locations or specific types of end-user activity. You can also monitor or block specific domains. Trends in interactions Use our comparative charting feature for a direct page load time comparison between real user (browser) interactions and trends appearing in Synthetic monitors. Distributed tracing Isolate latency from the web browser through back-end services with distributed tracing. The UI helps you see the connection across across a full transaction, from browser activity, to time spent in network, to back-end activity. Browser types Explore your end users' experience with your app segmented by any types of browsers they use, including: Top browsers by throughput Average page load time by platform type (mobile, desktop, and other) Selected browser type by version (for example, Chrome 31, 32, 33, etc.) This helps you quickly determine whether problems with page load timing may be related to a specific browser type or platform, or whether the problem is more widespread. Get started with browser monitoring Follow these basic steps, and you'll quickly be up and running in New Relic with browser monitoring! Review the compatibility details and basic requirements for browser monitoring. Install the browser agent. Go to [one.newrelic.com > Explorer > Browser applications. Use the Explorer to access all your entities, that is, anything we can identify that reports data, from applications and hosts to custom groupings of any elements. View summary data from your Browser summary page, then drill down into page load timing details and other UI data. Configure your alerts for key performance data, or use our Applied Intelligence solutions to reduce alert noise, correlate incidents, and automatically detect anomalies. Query and visualize your default data (or customize your own), then analyze what that data says about your business. Customize and share your own charts and dashboards.",

      "body": "Browser monitoring includes strict security measures to provide a robust, standalone product with browser monitoring features. Before you install the browser agent, make sure your system meets these requirements. Want to try out our browser monitoring? Create a New Relic account for free! No credit card required. Basic requirements To report data to browser, your application must at a minimum meet two basic requirements: The traffic to the application must be from clients able to load and execute browser JavaScript code and set cookies. Clients accessing the application must be able to send data to New Relic through HTTP requests. HTTPS is required for browser Pro features. Important Browsers that subscribe to a disconnect list or that use content filtering extensions such as AdBlock may not be able to send data to New Relic. For example, if you are using the Enhanced Tracking Prevention disconnect list for Mozilla Firefox 69.0 or higher, you will need to change the default configuration. Most typical browser applications meet these requirements. However, browser applications in restricted environments may have difficulty reporting data to New Relic; for example: Hybrid mobile applications Applications installed on unusual hardware, such as point-of-sale terminals or consumer appliances For more information, review the instrumentation for browser monitoring documentation, and verify end-user network access. Browser types Instrumentation is compatible with every browser type, including Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox, Microsoft Internet Explorer and Edge, and Apple Safari. The user interface is compatible with New Relic's supported browser versions. Exceptions Comments Paint timings The firstPaint and firstContentfulPaint attributes in BrowserInteraction, PageView, and PageViewTiming events are only compatible with: Chrome 60 or higher for desktop and mobile (Android webview and Chrome for Android) Opera 47 or higher for desktop Opera 44 or higher for Android mobile Samsung Internet for mobile AJAX AJAX timing features are not available with: Chrome for iPhone and iPad IE 7 and 8 PageAction events PageAction events require a browser that fully supports cross-domain XMLHttpRequests. Internet Explorer versions 9 and lower cannot record PageAction events. Learn more on querying your data. Session traces Session traces are reported only from browsers that support the Resource Timing Specification. SHA-256 New Relic can only monitor browsers that are compatible with SHA-256. APM agents You can deploy the browser agent for apps monitored by APM, or you can deploy the browser agent for your standalone apps. For more information, see the installation procedures. If you are deploying browser for an app using APM, make sure your agent supports browser monitoring: C SDK: Version 1.0.0 or higher Go: Version 2.5.0 or higher Java: Version 3.4.0 or higher .NET: Version 2.20.25.0 or higher Node.js: Version 1.4.0 or higher PHP: Version 4.4.5.35 or higher Python: Version 2.10.1.9 or higher Ruby: Version 3.7.0.177 or higher Supported frameworks The browser agent collects data on all front-end frameworks. However, the monitoring occurs on lower-level \"primitives\" that JavaScript frameworks use, so the level of detail collected by the instrumentation may vary depending on your specific framework. Exceptions Comments Zone.js If you're using AngularJS and you want to use our SPA monitoring features, note that Zone.js versions 0.6.18 to 0.6.24 are not compatible with browser. In all cases, the browser agent must be loaded before Zone.js to avoid errors. Cypress.io Browser is unable to properly instrument the open and send methods of requests when tests are run in Cypress. This will cause the following error to be thrown: Cannot set property 'status' of undefined Copy This will only affect customers running tests with the Browser agent present in their code. Production applications should not be affected. html2pdf.js This library is not compatible with our Pro+SPA agent due to the way this library wraps promises. If you're using this library, we recommend selecting the Pro agent type. Content Security Policy (CSP) considerations In order to obtain accurate browser performance metrics, browser requires the use of a small, inline JavaScript snippet. New Relic carefully reviews the inline JavaScript to prevent Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) and other potential vulnerabilities. Content Security Policy Level 2 adds restrictions to the types of JavaScript allowed, such as inline scripts. It also limits which domains can load scripts during page load. Important If your website does not allow any third-party hosted JavaScript to run, you must request a CSP exception via your organization’s standard procedures in order to install the browser monitoring agent. When requesting a CSP exception, follow your organization's standard procedures to contact your web or security team. The browser JavaScript agent requires the following CSP exceptions in order to run properly. Alternatively, you can add all of these exceptions to the fallback default-src directive (instead of script-src and connect-src). CSP exception Comments unsafe-inline Add to the script-src directive or to the fallback default-src directive. This is required because the agent is installed by including an inline script. https://js-agent.newrelic.com Add to the script-src directive or to the fallback default-src directive. This is where additional script files that the agent requires are hosted. https://bam.nr-data.net https://bam-cell.nr-data.net Important Add https://gov-bam.nr-data.net if you're using FedRAMP-compliant endpoints. Add to the script-src directive or to the fallback default-src directive. This is where the agent sends its collected data. One of the calls to this URL is a JSONP call, which means that the URL must be allowed as a script source. Add to the connect-src directive or to the fallback default-src directive. The connect-src directive affects the URLs that scripts can call (for example, using the XMLHttpRequest interface). If you have CSP restrictions specifically around this directive, then add this URL as an exception.",

To update to the latest version, check your version number, then follow the steps for either updating an APM-managed installation or upgrading a copy/paste installation. Check your version number To verify your browser version number: View the source code of a page which includes the JavaScript snippet. Search the page source for js-agent.newrelic.com/nr-. The numbers that follow nr- are your current version. For example, js-agent.newrelic.com/nr-593.min.js indicates you are running version 593 of the browser script. There are different agent types. The Pro+SPA agent has the format js-agent.newrelic.com/nr-spa-1184.min.js To verify the latest version of the browser script loader: Go to js-agent.newrelic.com/nr-loader-full-current.min.js . Search for js-agent.newrelic.com/nr-, then note the numbers that follow nr-. If the latest version number is higher than the number of the version you are currently running, update your browser agent. Check deployment method Your browser agent may have been deployed in two ways: either using a manual implementation (copying and pasting the snippet) or automatically instrumented using an APM agent. To check which deployment method was used, run this command in the JavaScript console: > newrelic.info.sa Copy If the command returns 1, then your browser agent used the copy/paste method. Update your APM-managed installation To update your APM-managed browser installation, restart your APM agent. Your app will automatically update to the latest JavaScript snippet. To ensure the new script registers, you may need to clear your cache. For more information, follow the troubleshooting procedures to manually check and clear the cache. Update your copy/paste installation Use any of the following options to access the browser JavaScript snippet needed to update a copy/paste installation. After accessing the snippet, be sure to replace all of your existing snippet with the new version. If you have a standalone installation with a few applications, you can retrieve the snippet from the UI, and then replace it with the new version. If you have many applications, you can use the REST API or the loader endpoint to automate the update process. Caution Do not simply change the version number in the existing snippet. This can result in incomplete data collection. For best results after you use any of the following options, always update the agent. Retrieve the snippet from the UI Download the latest version of the snippet: Go to one.newrelic.com > Browser > (select an app) > Application settings. This option is only available for standalone installations. Extract the snippet with the REST API To update the snippet using the New Relic REST API, follow the process for viewing a specific browser app. The loader_script attribute in your response will include the latest JavaScript snippet. This may be a good solution if you have many applications to manage, or if your browser app is linked to an APM app. Update using the loader endpoint To update the snippet from the New Relic loader endpoint, you can choose which type of browser agent you want: Pro+SPA endpoint Pro endpoint Lite endpoint These endpoints always point to the latest version of the agent. We recommend using the Pro+SPA agent. Read more about these agent types. These loader endpoints are generic and do not include your specific configuration data. To add your configuration data to the loaders: Find your browser application ID and license key: Follow standard procedures to use the New Relic UI or the REST API. Set your browser application ID and license key immediately after the snippet. NREUM.info = { applicationID: \"YOUR-APPLICATION-ID\", licenseKey: \"YOUR-BROWSER-LICENSE-KEY\" }; Copy",

      "body": "Browser monitoring's PageViewTiming event sends each data point as a separate event as soon as it is available. Because we do not restrict the timing, you can receive first paint or first interaction data regardless of when it fires. This document describes why and how to use PageViewTiming and its attributes to query data about your site, component loading, and user performance metrics, both from visual and responsiveness standpoints. Why use PageViewTiming? If your application uses asynchronous or dynamic pages, you may need additional details about site or component loading. But pages can load content in many different ways, and users control when they interact with that content. This is why some user-centric performance metrics happen outside the standard window onload (page load time) in the browser agent. For example, users may become impatient and begin clicking as soon as content is on the webpage. Or, they may wait to use the page until long after content is loaded. The PageViewTiming event provides a more real-time delivery mechanism that does not have a dependency on any other event. The additional metrics can help you understand how users experience your site, both from visual and responsiveness standpoints. Support for Google's Core Web Vitals As of agent version 1177 for browser monitoring, we have full support for Google's Core Web Vitals for 2020. The metrics that make up Core Web Vitals will evolve over time. The current set for 2020 focuses on three aspects of the user experience: loading, interactivity, and visual stability. This includes the following metrics and their respective thresholds: Core Web Vitals metrics include loading, interactivity, and visual stability. Largest Contentful Paint (LCP): measures loading performance. To provide a good user experience, LCP should occur within 2.5 seconds of when the page first starts loading. First Input Delay (FID): measures interactivity. To provide a good user experience, pages should have a FID of less than 100 milliseconds. Cumulative Layout Shift (CLS): measures visual stability. To provide a good user experience, pages should maintain a CLS of less than 0.1. For each of these metrics, to ensure you're hitting the recommended target for most of your users, a good threshold to measure is the 75th percentile of page loads, segmented across mobile and desktop devices. To learn more, watch our Nerd Days talk on perceived performance. Detailed visual, interactivity, and responsiveness metrics The BrowserInteraction and PageView events end their reporting when they receive the page window load (or window load and AJAX) timing. However, paint and interactivity metrics can happen at any time. PageViewTiming delivers these metrics as a separate event to: Account for the variability in this timing. Avoid setting an arbitrary timeout. Prevent holding BrowserInteraction and PageView events indefinitely. Additional data Comments firstPaint and firstContentfulPaint The firstPaint and firstContentfulPaint attributes already are available with BrowserInteraction and PageView events. However, they are not always reliably captured before the window onload event fires. Using PageViewTiming gives you a way to capture these metrics even if they happen after the original page load time. This gives you a better understanding of the correlation between responsiveness of that load event and the visual rendering of your content. largestContentfulPaint The largestContentfulPaint,metric is available with agent version 1163 or higher. It reports the render time of the largest content element visible in the viewport. Google's research found that looking at when the largest element was rendered was a more accurate way to measure when the main content of a page is loaded and useful. For more information about this metric, including limitations and considerations, see the w3c draft. We also report the cumulative layout shift (CLS) score attribute with LCP. This attribute is reported as cumulativeLayoutShift. Largest Contentful Paint is one of three metrics identified by Google as the Core Web Vitals. LCP values up to 2.5 secs are considered \"Good,\" between 2.5-4.0 secs are considered \"Needs Improvement,\" and above 4.0 secs are considered \"Poor.\" firstInteraction and firstInputDelay With the addition of firstInteraction and firstInputDelay, you can quickly determine the ways that your users are interacting with that visual content. These metrics tell you not only when they interacted, but what type of interaction (mousedown, pointerdown, etc.) and how long it took for them to receive a response from your site. The firstInputDelay metric lies in the middle of FirstContentfulPaint and Time to Interactive (TTI) metrics. It measures the time between when a first input can be made and when the browser's main thread is able to respond to any interactions. We also report the cumulative layout shift (CLS) score attribute at the moment of the user's first interaction. This attribute is reported as cumulativeLayoutShift. First Input Delay is one of three metrics identified by Google as the Core Web Vitals. FID values up to 100 ms are considered \"Good,\" between 100-300 ms are considered \"Needs Improvement,\" and above 300 ms are considered \"Poor.\" For a more detailed explanation, see our browser monitoring release notes. cumulativeLayoutShift Cumulative Layout Shift (CLS) is available with agent v1177 or higher. CLS is an important, user-centric metric for measuring visual stability because it helps quantify how often users experience unexpected layout shifts. A low CLS helps ensure that the page is delightful. This is one of three metrics identified by Google as the Core Web Vitals. Cumulative Layout Shift is one of three metrics identified by Google as the Core Web Vitals. CLS scores up to 0.1 are considered \"Good,\" between 0.1-0.25 are considered \"Needs Improvement,\" and above 0.25 are considered \"Poor.\" timingName You can review different types of activities with the timingName attribute, such as firstPaint, firstContentfulPaint, firstInteraction, largestContentfulPaint, pageHide and windowUnload. For example, a PageViewTiming event may have a timingName of firstPaint and a firstPaint value of .03. The event will also include all default attributes included with the standard BrowserInteraction and PageView events. elementId This is the Id, if specified, of the largestContentfulPaint element. This value will only be reported with the LCP metric. This value can be null. elementSize This is the reported size of the largestContentfulPaint element. This value will only be reported with the LCP metric. pageHide The pageHide event, available with agent v1177 or higher, is sent when the browser hides the current page in the process of presenting a different page from the session's history. For example, when the user clicks the browser's Back button, the current page receives a pageHide event before the previous page is shown. For supporting documentation and browser compatibility for the pageHide event, see the MDN Web Docs site. We also report the cumulative layout shift (CLS) score attribute with pageHide. This attribute is reported as cumulativeLayoutShift. windowLoad The windowLoad event is available with agent v1177 or higher. This is fired when the whole page has loaded, including all dependent resources such as stylesheets and images. For supporting documentation and browser compatibility for the windowLoad event, see the MDN Web Docs site. We also report the cumulative layout shift (CLS) score attribute with windowLoad. This attribute is reported as cumulativeLayoutShift. windowUnload The windowUnload event is available with agent v1163 or higher. This is fired when a document or child resource is being unloaded. For supporting documentation and browser compatibility for the windowUnload event, see the MDN Web Docs site. We also report the cumulative layout shift (CLS) score attribute with windowUnload. This attribute is reported as cumulativeLayoutShift. Compatibility and requirements Requirements: Meets install requirements. Reporting of this event requires browser agent version 1153 or higher and a Pro or Pro+SPA agent. Follow our Browser agent release notes to find out when new metrics are released. These metrics are supported by the following browser versions. For unsupported browsers, no PageViewTiming events will be recorded. Metrics Supported browser versions cumulativeLayoutShift Chrome 79 Metric is elevated to stable; changes in metric definition will be reported in this log. Chrome 77 Metric exposed via API: Cumulative Layout Shift available via Layout Instability API firstPaint firstContentfulPaint Chrome 60 or higher for desktop and mobile (Android webview and Chrome for Android) Opera 47 or higher for desktop Opera 44 or higher for Android mobile Samsung Internet for mobile largestContentfulPaint Chrome 77 or higher for desktop and mobile firstInteraction firstInputDelay These metrics require the addEventListener browser API. This API is available in all modern browsers, including: Apple Safari Google Chrome Microsoft Internet Explorer (IE) versions 9 or higher Mozilla Firefox pageHide This metric is currently supported by all browsers on desktop and mobile. Compatibility matrix via MDN documentation. windowLoad This metric is currently supported by all browsers on desktop and mobile. Compatibility matrix via MDN documentation. windowUnload This metric is currently supported by all browsers on desktop and mobile. Compatibility matrix via MDN documentation. CumulativeLayoutShift Cumulative Layout Shift (CLS) is a metric measuring the stability of the content on a webpage. For a complete description, see web.dev/cls. How is CLS captured in New Relic Shifts in page layout as reported by the Layout Instability API are aggregated throughout the life of the page and reported as an attribute on all PageViewTiming events, representing the CLS value when that event occurred. Using this model, users can look at their CLS value at different points in the page's life; for example, CLS values up until the first-time users interact with the page or hide the page. Approximating other CLS sources Lighthouse captures CLS value only up to the time when a page is loaded, which is useful in a development or lab environment. You can approximate Lighthouse values by looking at the windowLoad PageViewTiming event. CrUX report uses values captured over the lifespan of the page, which is useful to analyze worst-case shifts in a RUM environment. You can approximate CrUX values by looking at the CLS attribute on the windowUnload PageViewTiming event. These values will not be exactly the same because of different sample sets and a difference in how values from long-lived web pages are included. The New Relic browser monitoring agent captures CLS when the page unloads, while CrUX collects and updates the metric throughout the lifespan of the page. How CLS is aggregated As of July 2021, Google has updated the way CLS values are aggregated. Browser monitoring agent versions v12xx use the method described in Evolving the CLS metric. Browser monitoring agent v12xx or higher: Layout shift values are captured in windows. Layout shifts that occurred within 1 second of each other, but no more than 5 seconds between the first and last shift, are part of the same window. A CLS score represents the sum of layout shift values from the window with the highest sum of layout shift values. Prior to Browser agent v12xx: A CLS score represents the sum of all layout shifts that occurred up until that point in the page's life. Query your event data Here are some sample queries for the event data to help you get started.

      "body": "This document explains: How a web page loads How browser monitoring measures page load timing, also known as real user monitoring (RUM) Tip This is a description of traditional, synchronous page load timing. Browser can also monitor asynchronous page load timing. Page load process Here are the major steps in the loading of most web pages. The numbers 1-6 in the diagram correspond to the numbered steps below. Page load timeline: The steps involved in a web page load. Browser monitoring charts display the following segments of that process: Network, Web application, DOM processing, and Page rendering. A page load begins when a user selects a hyperlink, submits a form, or types a URL in a browser. This is also referred to as the initial request or the navigation start. The user's action sends a request across the network to the web application server. The request reaches the application for processing. (The request may take some time to start being processed. This could be the result of request queuing or it could be other factors.) The app finishes processing and sends an HTML response back across the network to the user's browser. This is sometimes referred to as response start or first byte. (Time To First Byte) The user's browser begins receiving the HTML response, and starts to process the Document Object Model, or DOM. The DOM finishes loading; this point is known as DOM ready. Using the DOM, the user's browser starts to render the page. The page finishes rendering in the user's browser and the window load event fires. (For pages that use asynchronous loading, some elements may continue to load after the window load event occurs.) Page load time charts in browser monitoring Browser monitoring captures the major page load timing segments in the browser Summary page and the Page views page. If you have SPA monitoring enabled, you will have access to both this chart and SPA-specific charts. The charts show: Network Web application time DOM processing Page rendering Other segments as applicable, such as request queuing The chart colors match the colors in the page load timing diagram. one.newrelic.com > Browser > (select an app) > Summary: The load time chart appears on the Summary and Page views page. The way browser collects these times depends on the browser's capability to use the Navigation Timing Specification API. You can add custom page load timing events with the browser agent API. Here are descriptions of the activity included in the browser load time chart segments: Web application The web application time includes the time spent on the application server. This can only be determined if the browser instrumentation for page load timing was provided by an APM agent. Network The Network layer includes time spent in redirects as well as in requesting and receiving HTML. It does not include time on the server or for static assets. Network time measurement starts from the initial click on a link. Network time includes DNS and may include more than one lookup if you have redirects on your site, TCP (including the firewall, unless you have configured request queue time monitoring), and SSL connect time. If you have configured request queue time monitoring, then the network time does not include any of the request queue time that occurs after the X-Request header. If you have not configured request queue time monitoring, then the network time does include all of the request queue time. The Navigation Timing Specification API provides a detailed breakdown of network time. (For old browsers, the timer starts on the \"before unload event.\") For apps that have been deployed using the copy/paste method, Browser includes web app and queue time in Network time. This is because browser relies on the server-side agent to pass the application values to the browser agent through auto-injection. For more information about how this back-end time breaks down from the browser's point of view, use the Session traces page. The session traces report on all the network related events available, so you can see on a case-by-case basis how the browser is spending time on DNS lookups and other network events. Important Even with request queuing configured, the front-end server's setup can still affect network time. This is because the front-end server does not add the queueing time header until after it actually accepts and processes the request. If the front-end server is configured in some way that causes requests to start backlogging and to queue up in the listener socket that the front-end server uses to accept connections, then you will see network time increase for browser monitoring. The queueing time headers can never account for backlog in this listener socket. DOM processing DOM processing is the time it takes to parse the HTML into a DOM and retrieve or execute synchronous scripts. If the browser starts to download images in this phase, page load timing will capture the image load time. The DOM processing and page rendering layers include network time for static assets (assets that are not explicitly retrieved after page load). However, if a script on the page dynamically inserts image tags and loads images after the server or content delivery system (CDN) finishes, page load timing cannot capture the image load time. Page rendering The Page rendering phase is the time between the DOM being complete and the window load event. This phase measures browser-side processing of the page content, and often includes time for scripts and static assets to load. Request queuing Request queuing will be displayed in the load time chart if your account has both browser and APM linked. In New Relic, request queuing refers to the time between a request entering your production systems and it reaching your application. Depending on the specifics of your production infrastructure, this time may include an actual queue that requests enter, or it may represent other functions that take time (such as load balancing or internal network latency). App server requests vs. browser transactions Often the number of app server transactions (requests per minute or rpm) is larger than the number of browser transactions (pages per minute or ppm) for the same application. For more information, see the troubleshooting procedures. Outliers No matter how well your application performs, there will be some slow browsers, platforms, and networks that make your overall aggregate response times appear slower. To minimize the skew caused by outliers, page load timing clamps and scales the end user response times that are greater than 4.5 times your application's browser Apdex T setting to 4.5 times the Apdex T, or to 13.5 seconds, whichever is greater. (Histogram outliers are cut off at 95%.) For example, if your application's end user Apdex T threshold is 8 seconds, those response times will be clamped at 36 seconds. This minimizes the impact of these response times on your overall application but still provides accounting for \"frustrated\" Apdex scores. For SPA monitoring, outliers are handled differently. When the duration of an initial page load or route change reaches 30 minutes, that event is treated as invalid data and is discarded.",

If a user navigates from a site without page load timing to a site with page load timing (for example, to the first page on your page load timing-enabled site), special considerations for navigation start time arise. Contents Network estimate The page load timing JavaScript utility file creates a cookie with the navigation start time when a user leaves a page (by hooking an event, beforeunload, or pagehide, depending on the browser). However, when navigating away from a site without page load timing enabled, the JavaScript code will not be present, and the cookie will not be created. Then, when the user hits the first page of a site, the navigation start time cannot be determined, because there is no cookie. In this case the browser agent has all the data (queue time, app time, DOM content and rendering time) except network time. Navigation start time is required to compute network time. Rather than toss the data, the page load timing feature estimates the network time based on recently accumulated averages for your application, regionally. This way the page load timing feature provides a more accurate throughput measurement, and the rest of the data is retained. This is especially important for sites with a high bounce rate (when users visit only one page). The more visitors you have from different regions, the more accurate the network estimate will be. Network estimate unavailable If a network estimate is not available for your application and for the region where the hit originated, the page load timing process reverts to a network estimate across all reporting apps for the region.

      "body": "Browser monitoring's PageViewTiming event sends each data point as a separate event as soon as it is available. Because we do not restrict the timing, you can receive first paint or first interaction data regardless of when it fires. This document describes why and how to use PageViewTiming and its attributes to query data about your site, component loading, and user performance metrics, both from visual and responsiveness standpoints. Why use PageViewTiming? If your application uses asynchronous or dynamic pages, you may need additional details about site or component loading. But pages can load content in many different ways, and users control when they interact with that content. This is why some user-centric performance metrics happen outside the standard window onload (page load time) in the browser agent. For example, users may become impatient and begin clicking as soon as content is on the webpage. Or, they may wait to use the page until long after content is loaded. The PageViewTiming event provides a more real-time delivery mechanism that does not have a dependency on any other event. The additional metrics can help you understand how users experience your site, both from visual and responsiveness standpoints. Support for Google's Core Web Vitals As of agent version 1177 for browser monitoring, we have full support for Google's Core Web Vitals for 2020. The metrics that make up Core Web Vitals will evolve over time. The current set for 2020 focuses on three aspects of the user experience: loading, interactivity, and visual stability. This includes the following metrics and their respective thresholds: Core Web Vitals metrics include loading, interactivity, and visual stability. Largest Contentful Paint (LCP): measures loading performance. To provide a good user experience, LCP should occur within 2.5 seconds of when the page first starts loading. First Input Delay (FID): measures interactivity. To provide a good user experience, pages should have a FID of less than 100 milliseconds. Cumulative Layout Shift (CLS): measures visual stability. To provide a good user experience, pages should maintain a CLS of less than 0.1. For each of these metrics, to ensure you're hitting the recommended target for most of your users, a good threshold to measure is the 75th percentile of page loads, segmented across mobile and desktop devices. To learn more, watch our Nerd Days talk on perceived performance. Detailed visual, interactivity, and responsiveness metrics The BrowserInteraction and PageView events end their reporting when they receive the page window load (or window load and AJAX) timing. However, paint and interactivity metrics can happen at any time. PageViewTiming delivers these metrics as a separate event to: Account for the variability in this timing. Avoid setting an arbitrary timeout. Prevent holding BrowserInteraction and PageView events indefinitely. Additional data Comments firstPaint and firstContentfulPaint The firstPaint and firstContentfulPaint attributes already are available with BrowserInteraction and PageView events. However, they are not always reliably captured before the window onload event fires. Using PageViewTiming gives you a way to capture these metrics even if they happen after the original page load time. This gives you a better understanding of the correlation between responsiveness of that load event and the visual rendering of your content. largestContentfulPaint The largestContentfulPaint,metric is available with agent version 1163 or higher. It reports the render time of the largest content element visible in the viewport. Google's research found that looking at when the largest element was rendered was a more accurate way to measure when the main content of a page is loaded and useful. For more information about this metric, including limitations and considerations, see the w3c draft. We also report the cumulative layout shift (CLS) score attribute with LCP. This attribute is reported as cumulativeLayoutShift. Largest Contentful Paint is one of three metrics identified by Google as the Core Web Vitals. LCP values up to 2.5 secs are considered \"Good,\" between 2.5-4.0 secs are considered \"Needs Improvement,\" and above 4.0 secs are considered \"Poor.\" firstInteraction and firstInputDelay With the addition of firstInteraction and firstInputDelay, you can quickly determine the ways that your users are interacting with that visual content. These metrics tell you not only when they interacted, but what type of interaction (mousedown, pointerdown, etc.) and how long it took for them to receive a response from your site. The firstInputDelay metric lies in the middle of FirstContentfulPaint and Time to Interactive (TTI) metrics. It measures the time between when a first input can be made and when the browser's main thread is able to respond to any interactions. We also report the cumulative layout shift (CLS) score attribute at the moment of the user's first interaction. This attribute is reported as cumulativeLayoutShift. First Input Delay is one of three metrics identified by Google as the Core Web Vitals. FID values up to 100 ms are considered \"Good,\" between 100-300 ms are considered \"Needs Improvement,\" and above 300 ms are considered \"Poor.\" For a more detailed explanation, see our browser monitoring release notes. cumulativeLayoutShift Cumulative Layout Shift (CLS) is available with agent v1177 or higher. CLS is an important, user-centric metric for measuring visual stability because it helps quantify how often users experience unexpected layout shifts. A low CLS helps ensure that the page is delightful. This is one of three metrics identified by Google as the Core Web Vitals. Cumulative Layout Shift is one of three metrics identified by Google as the Core Web Vitals. CLS scores up to 0.1 are considered \"Good,\" between 0.1-0.25 are considered \"Needs Improvement,\" and above 0.25 are considered \"Poor.\" timingName You can review different types of activities with the timingName attribute, such as firstPaint, firstContentfulPaint, firstInteraction, largestContentfulPaint, pageHide and windowUnload. For example, a PageViewTiming event may have a timingName of firstPaint and a firstPaint value of .03. The event will also include all default attributes included with the standard BrowserInteraction and PageView events. elementId This is the Id, if specified, of the largestContentfulPaint element. This value will only be reported with the LCP metric. This value can be null. elementSize This is the reported size of the largestContentfulPaint element. This value will only be reported with the LCP metric. pageHide The pageHide event, available with agent v1177 or higher, is sent when the browser hides the current page in the process of presenting a different page from the session's history. For example, when the user clicks the browser's Back button, the current page receives a pageHide event before the previous page is shown. For supporting documentation and browser compatibility for the pageHide event, see the MDN Web Docs site. We also report the cumulative layout shift (CLS) score attribute with pageHide. This attribute is reported as cumulativeLayoutShift. windowLoad The windowLoad event is available with agent v1177 or higher. This is fired when the whole page has loaded, including all dependent resources such as stylesheets and images. For supporting documentation and browser compatibility for the windowLoad event, see the MDN Web Docs site. We also report the cumulative layout shift (CLS) score attribute with windowLoad. This attribute is reported as cumulativeLayoutShift. windowUnload The windowUnload event is available with agent v1163 or higher. This is fired when a document or child resource is being unloaded. For supporting documentation and browser compatibility for the windowUnload event, see the MDN Web Docs site. We also report the cumulative layout shift (CLS) score attribute with windowUnload. This attribute is reported as cumulativeLayoutShift. Compatibility and requirements Requirements: Meets install requirements. Reporting of this event requires browser agent version 1153 or higher and a Pro or Pro+SPA agent. Follow our Browser agent release notes to find out when new metrics are released. These metrics are supported by the following browser versions. For unsupported browsers, no PageViewTiming events will be recorded. Metrics Supported browser versions cumulativeLayoutShift Chrome 79 Metric is elevated to stable; changes in metric definition will be reported in this log. Chrome 77 Metric exposed via API: Cumulative Layout Shift available via Layout Instability API firstPaint firstContentfulPaint Chrome 60 or higher for desktop and mobile (Android webview and Chrome for Android) Opera 47 or higher for desktop Opera 44 or higher for Android mobile Samsung Internet for mobile largestContentfulPaint Chrome 77 or higher for desktop and mobile firstInteraction firstInputDelay These metrics require the addEventListener browser API. This API is available in all modern browsers, including: Apple Safari Google Chrome Microsoft Internet Explorer (IE) versions 9 or higher Mozilla Firefox pageHide This metric is currently supported by all browsers on desktop and mobile. Compatibility matrix via MDN documentation. windowLoad This metric is currently supported by all browsers on desktop and mobile. Compatibility matrix via MDN documentation. windowUnload This metric is currently supported by all browsers on desktop and mobile. Compatibility matrix via MDN documentation. CumulativeLayoutShift Cumulative Layout Shift (CLS) is a metric measuring the stability of the content on a webpage. For a complete description, see web.dev/cls. How is CLS captured in New Relic Shifts in page layout as reported by the Layout Instability API are aggregated throughout the life of the page and reported as an attribute on all PageViewTiming events, representing the CLS value when that event occurred. Using this model, users can look at their CLS value at different points in the page's life; for example, CLS values up until the first-time users interact with the page or hide the page. Approximating other CLS sources Lighthouse captures CLS value only up to the time when a page is loaded, which is useful in a development or lab environment. You can approximate Lighthouse values by looking at the windowLoad PageViewTiming event. CrUX report uses values captured over the lifespan of the page, which is useful to analyze worst-case shifts in a RUM environment. You can approximate CrUX values by looking at the CLS attribute on the windowUnload PageViewTiming event. These values will not be exactly the same because of different sample sets and a difference in how values from long-lived web pages are included. The New Relic browser monitoring agent captures CLS when the page unloads, while CrUX collects and updates the metric throughout the lifespan of the page. How CLS is aggregated As of July 2021, Google has updated the way CLS values are aggregated. Browser monitoring agent versions v12xx use the method described in Evolving the CLS metric. Browser monitoring agent v12xx or higher: Layout shift values are captured in windows. Layout shifts that occurred within 1 second of each other, but no more than 5 seconds between the first and last shift, are part of the same window. A CLS score represents the sum of layout shift values from the window with the highest sum of layout shift values. Prior to Browser agent v12xx: A CLS score represents the sum of all layout shifts that occurred up until that point in the page's life. Query your event data Here are some sample queries for the event data to help you get started.

      "body": "This document explains: How a web page loads How browser monitoring measures page load timing, also known as real user monitoring (RUM) Tip This is a description of traditional, synchronous page load timing. Browser can also monitor asynchronous page load timing. Page load process Here are the major steps in the loading of most web pages. The numbers 1-6 in the diagram correspond to the numbered steps below. Page load timeline: The steps involved in a web page load. Browser monitoring charts display the following segments of that process: Network, Web application, DOM processing, and Page rendering. A page load begins when a user selects a hyperlink, submits a form, or types a URL in a browser. This is also referred to as the initial request or the navigation start. The user's action sends a request across the network to the web application server. The request reaches the application for processing. (The request may take some time to start being processed. This could be the result of request queuing or it could be other factors.) The app finishes processing and sends an HTML response back across the network to the user's browser. This is sometimes referred to as response start or first byte. (Time To First Byte) The user's browser begins receiving the HTML response, and starts to process the Document Object Model, or DOM. The DOM finishes loading; this point is known as DOM ready. Using the DOM, the user's browser starts to render the page. The page finishes rendering in the user's browser and the window load event fires. (For pages that use asynchronous loading, some elements may continue to load after the window load event occurs.) Page load time charts in browser monitoring Browser monitoring captures the major page load timing segments in the browser Summary page and the Page views page. If you have SPA monitoring enabled, you will have access to both this chart and SPA-specific charts. The charts show: Network Web application time DOM processing Page rendering Other segments as applicable, such as request queuing The chart colors match the colors in the page load timing diagram. one.newrelic.com > Browser > (select an app) > Summary: The load time chart appears on the Summary and Page views page. The way browser collects these times depends on the browser's capability to use the Navigation Timing Specification API. You can add custom page load timing events with the browser agent API. Here are descriptions of the activity included in the browser load time chart segments: Web application The web application time includes the time spent on the application server. This can only be determined if the browser instrumentation for page load timing was provided by an APM agent. Network The Network layer includes time spent in redirects as well as in requesting and receiving HTML. It does not include time on the server or for static assets. Network time measurement starts from the initial click on a link. Network time includes DNS and may include more than one lookup if you have redirects on your site, TCP (including the firewall, unless you have configured request queue time monitoring), and SSL connect time. If you have configured request queue time monitoring, then the network time does not include any of the request queue time that occurs after the X-Request header. If you have not configured request queue time monitoring, then the network time does include all of the request queue time. The Navigation Timing Specification API provides a detailed breakdown of network time. (For old browsers, the timer starts on the \"before unload event.\") For apps that have been deployed using the copy/paste method, Browser includes web app and queue time in Network time. This is because browser relies on the server-side agent to pass the application values to the browser agent through auto-injection. For more information about how this back-end time breaks down from the browser's point of view, use the Session traces page. The session traces report on all the network related events available, so you can see on a case-by-case basis how the browser is spending time on DNS lookups and other network events. Important Even with request queuing configured, the front-end server's setup can still affect network time. This is because the front-end server does not add the queueing time header until after it actually accepts and processes the request. If the front-end server is configured in some way that causes requests to start backlogging and to queue up in the listener socket that the front-end server uses to accept connections, then you will see network time increase for browser monitoring. The queueing time headers can never account for backlog in this listener socket. DOM processing DOM processing is the time it takes to parse the HTML into a DOM and retrieve or execute synchronous scripts. If the browser starts to download images in this phase, page load timing will capture the image load time. The DOM processing and page rendering layers include network time for static assets (assets that are not explicitly retrieved after page load). However, if a script on the page dynamically inserts image tags and loads images after the server or content delivery system (CDN) finishes, page load timing cannot capture the image load time. Page rendering The Page rendering phase is the time between the DOM being complete and the window load event. This phase measures browser-side processing of the page content, and often includes time for scripts and static assets to load. Request queuing Request queuing will be displayed in the load time chart if your account has both browser and APM linked. In New Relic, request queuing refers to the time between a request entering your production systems and it reaching your application. Depending on the specifics of your production infrastructure, this time may include an actual queue that requests enter, or it may represent other functions that take time (such as load balancing or internal network latency). App server requests vs. browser transactions Often the number of app server transactions (requests per minute or rpm) is larger than the number of browser transactions (pages per minute or ppm) for the same application. For more information, see the troubleshooting procedures. Outliers No matter how well your application performs, there will be some slow browsers, platforms, and networks that make your overall aggregate response times appear slower. To minimize the skew caused by outliers, page load timing clamps and scales the end user response times that are greater than 4.5 times your application's browser Apdex T setting to 4.5 times the Apdex T, or to 13.5 seconds, whichever is greater. (Histogram outliers are cut off at 95%.) For example, if your application's end user Apdex T threshold is 8 seconds, those response times will be clamped at 36 seconds. This minimizes the impact of these response times on your overall application but still provides accounting for \"frustrated\" Apdex scores. For SPA monitoring, outliers are handled differently. When the duration of an initial page load or route change reaches 30 minutes, that event is treated as invalid data and is discarded.",

If a user navigates from a site without page load timing to a site with page load timing (for example, to the first page on your page load timing-enabled site), special considerations for navigation start time arise. Contents Network estimate The page load timing JavaScript utility file creates a cookie with the navigation start time when a user leaves a page (by hooking an event, beforeunload, or pagehide, depending on the browser). However, when navigating away from a site without page load timing enabled, the JavaScript code will not be present, and the cookie will not be created. Then, when the user hits the first page of a site, the navigation start time cannot be determined, because there is no cookie. In this case the browser agent has all the data (queue time, app time, DOM content and rendering time) except network time. Navigation start time is required to compute network time. Rather than toss the data, the page load timing feature estimates the network time based on recently accumulated averages for your application, regionally. This way the page load timing feature provides a more accurate throughput measurement, and the rest of the data is retained. This is especially important for sites with a high bounce rate (when users visit only one page). The more visitors you have from different regions, the more accurate the network estimate will be. Network estimate unavailable If a network estimate is not available for your application and for the region where the hit originated, the page load timing process reverts to a network estimate across all reporting apps for the region. Failing that, the data is tossed. Note: For browsers that have the Navigation Timing API, this is not an issue, as the navigation start time can be determined without using a cookie.

Browser can also monitor asynchronous page load timing. Page load process Here are the major steps in the loading of most web pages. The numbers 1-6 in the diagram correspond to the numbered steps below. Page load timeline: The steps involved in a web page load. Browser monitoring charts display the following segments of that process: Network, Web application, DOM processing, and Page rendering. A page load begins when a user selects a hyperlink, submits a form, or types a URL in a browser. This is also referred to as the initial request or the navigation start. The user's action sends a request across the network to the web application server. The request reaches the application for processing. (The request may take some time to start being processed. This could be the result of request queuing or it could be other factors.) The app finishes processing and sends an HTML response back across the network to the user's browser. This is sometimes referred to as response start or first byte. (Time To First Byte) The user's browser begins receiving the HTML response, and starts to process the Document Object Model, or DOM. The DOM finishes loading; this point is known as DOM ready. Using the DOM, the user's browser starts to render the page. The page finishes rendering in the user's browser and the window load event fires. (For pages that use asynchronous loading, some elements may continue to load after the window load event occurs.) Page load time charts in browser monitoring Browser monitoring captures the major page load timing segments in the browser Summary page and the Page views page. If you have SPA monitoring enabled, you will have access to both this chart and SPA-specific charts. The charts show: Network Web application time DOM processing Page rendering Other segments as applicable, such as request queuing The chart colors match the colors in the page load timing diagram. one.newrelic.com > Browser > (select an app) > Summary: The load time chart appears on the Summary and Page views page. The way browser collects these times depends on the browser's capability to use the Navigation Timing Specification API. You can add custom page load timing events with the browser agent API. Here are descriptions of the activity included in the browser load time chart segments: Web application The web application time includes the time spent on the application server. This can only be determined if the browser instrumentation for page load timing was provided by an APM agent. Network The Network layer includes time spent in redirects as well as in requesting and receiving HTML. It does not include time on the server or for static assets. Network time measurement starts from the initial click on a link. Network time includes DNS and may include more than one lookup if you have redirects on your site, TCP (including the firewall, unless you have configured request queue time monitoring), and SSL connect time. If you have configured request queue time monitoring, then the network time does not include any of the request queue time that occurs after the X-Request header. If you have not configured request queue time monitoring, then the network time does include all of the request queue time. The Navigation Timing Specification API provides a detailed breakdown of network time. (For old browsers, the timer starts on the \"before unload event.\") For apps that have been deployed using the copy/paste method, Browser includes web app and queue time in Network time. This is because browser relies on the server-side agent to pass the application values to the browser agent through auto-injection. For more information about how this back-end time breaks down from the browser's point of view, use the Session traces page. The session traces report on all the network related events available, so you can see on a case-by-case basis how the browser is spending time on DNS lookups and other network events. Important Even with request queuing configured, the front-end server's setup can still affect network time. This is because the front-end server does not add the queueing time header until after it actually accepts and processes the request. If the front-end server is configured in some way that causes requests to start backlogging and to queue up in the listener socket that the front-end server uses to accept connections, then you will see network time increase for browser monitoring. The queueing time headers can never account for backlog in this listener socket.

The DOM processing and page rendering layers include network time for static assets (assets that are not explicitly retrieved after page load).

      "body": "Browser monitoring's PageViewTiming event sends each data point as a separate event as soon as it is available. Because we do not restrict the timing, you can receive first paint or first interaction data regardless of when it fires. This document describes why and how to use PageViewTiming and its attributes to query data about your site, component loading, and user performance metrics, both from visual and responsiveness standpoints. Why use PageViewTiming? If your application uses asynchronous or dynamic pages, you may need additional details about site or component loading. But pages can load content in many different ways, and users control when they interact with that content. This is why some user-centric performance metrics happen outside the standard window onload (page load time) in the browser agent. For example, users may become impatient and begin clicking as soon as content is on the webpage. Or, they may wait to use the page until long after content is loaded. The PageViewTiming event provides a more real-time delivery mechanism that does not have a dependency on any other event. The additional metrics can help you understand how users experience your site, both from visual and responsiveness standpoints. Support for Google's Core Web Vitals As of agent version 1177 for browser monitoring, we have full support for Google's Core Web Vitals for 2020. The metrics that make up Core Web Vitals will evolve over time. The current set for 2020 focuses on three aspects of the user experience: loading, interactivity, and visual stability. This includes the following metrics and their respective thresholds: Core Web Vitals metrics include loading, interactivity, and visual stability. Largest Contentful Paint (LCP): measures loading performance. To provide a good user experience, LCP should occur within 2.5 seconds of when the page first starts loading. First Input Delay (FID): measures interactivity. To provide a good user experience, pages should have a FID of less than 100 milliseconds. Cumulative Layout Shift (CLS): measures visual stability. To provide a good user experience, pages should maintain a CLS of less than 0.1. For each of these metrics, to ensure you're hitting the recommended target for most of your users, a good threshold to measure is the 75th percentile of page loads, segmented across mobile and desktop devices. To learn more, watch our Nerd Days talk on perceived performance. Detailed visual, interactivity, and responsiveness metrics The BrowserInteraction and PageView events end their reporting when they receive the page window load (or window load and AJAX) timing. However, paint and interactivity metrics can happen at any time. PageViewTiming delivers these metrics as a separate event to: Account for the variability in this timing. Avoid setting an arbitrary timeout. Prevent holding BrowserInteraction and PageView events indefinitely. Additional data Comments firstPaint and firstContentfulPaint The firstPaint and firstContentfulPaint attributes already are available with BrowserInteraction and PageView events. However, they are not always reliably captured before the window onload event fires. Using PageViewTiming gives you a way to capture these metrics even if they happen after the original page load time. This gives you a better understanding of the correlation between responsiveness of that load event and the visual rendering of your content. largestContentfulPaint The largestContentfulPaint,metric is available with agent version 1163 or higher. It reports the render time of the largest content element visible in the viewport. Google's research found that looking at when the largest element was rendered was a more accurate way to measure when the main content of a page is loaded and useful. For more information about this metric, including limitations and considerations, see the w3c draft. We also report the cumulative layout shift (CLS) score attribute with LCP. This attribute is reported as cumulativeLayoutShift. Largest Contentful Paint is one of three metrics identified by Google as the Core Web Vitals. LCP values up to 2.5 secs are considered \"Good,\" between 2.5-4.0 secs are considered \"Needs Improvement,\" and above 4.0 secs are considered \"Poor.\" firstInteraction and firstInputDelay With the addition of firstInteraction and firstInputDelay, you can quickly determine the ways that your users are interacting with that visual content. These metrics tell you not only when they interacted, but what type of interaction (mousedown, pointerdown, etc.) and how long it took for them to receive a response from your site. The firstInputDelay metric lies in the middle of FirstContentfulPaint and Time to Interactive (TTI) metrics. It measures the time between when a first input can be made and when the browser's main thread is able to respond to any interactions. We also report the cumulative layout shift (CLS) score attribute at the moment of the user's first interaction. This attribute is reported as cumulativeLayoutShift. First Input Delay is one of three metrics identified by Google as the Core Web Vitals. FID values up to 100 ms are considered \"Good,\" between 100-300 ms are considered \"Needs Improvement,\" and above 300 ms are considered \"Poor.\" For a more detailed explanation, see our browser monitoring release notes. cumulativeLayoutShift Cumulative Layout Shift (CLS) is available with agent v1177 or higher. CLS is an important, user-centric metric for measuring visual stability because it helps quantify how often users experience unexpected layout shifts. A low CLS helps ensure that the page is delightful. This is one of three metrics identified by Google as the Core Web Vitals. Cumulative Layout Shift is one of three metrics identified by Google as the Core Web Vitals. CLS scores up to 0.1 are considered \"Good,\" between 0.1-0.25 are considered \"Needs Improvement,\" and above 0.25 are considered \"Poor.\" timingName You can review different types of activities with the timingName attribute, such as firstPaint, firstContentfulPaint, firstInteraction, largestContentfulPaint, pageHide and windowUnload. For example, a PageViewTiming event may have a timingName of firstPaint and a firstPaint value of .03. The event will also include all default attributes included with the standard BrowserInteraction and PageView events. elementId This is the Id, if specified, of the largestContentfulPaint element. This value will only be reported with the LCP metric. This value can be null. elementSize This is the reported size of the largestContentfulPaint element. This value will only be reported with the LCP metric. pageHide The pageHide event, available with agent v1177 or higher, is sent when the browser hides the current page in the process of presenting a different page from the session's history. For example, when the user clicks the browser's Back button, the current page receives a pageHide event before the previous page is shown. For supporting documentation and browser compatibility for the pageHide event, see the MDN Web Docs site. We also report the cumulative layout shift (CLS) score attribute with pageHide. This attribute is reported as cumulativeLayoutShift. windowLoad The windowLoad event is available with agent v1177 or higher. This is fired when the whole page has loaded, including all dependent resources such as stylesheets and images. For supporting documentation and browser compatibility for the windowLoad event, see the MDN Web Docs site. We also report the cumulative layout shift (CLS) score attribute with windowLoad. This attribute is reported as cumulativeLayoutShift. windowUnload The windowUnload event is available with agent v1163 or higher. This is fired when a document or child resource is being unloaded. For supporting documentation and browser compatibility for the windowUnload event, see the MDN Web Docs site. We also report the cumulative layout shift (CLS) score attribute with windowUnload. This attribute is reported as cumulativeLayoutShift. Compatibility and requirements Requirements: Meets install requirements. Reporting of this event requires browser agent version 1153 or higher and a Pro or Pro+SPA agent. Follow our Browser agent release notes to find out when new metrics are released. These metrics are supported by the following browser versions. For unsupported browsers, no PageViewTiming events will be recorded. Metrics Supported browser versions cumulativeLayoutShift Chrome 79 Metric is elevated to stable; changes in metric definition will be reported in this log. Chrome 77 Metric exposed via API: Cumulative Layout Shift available via Layout Instability API firstPaint firstContentfulPaint Chrome 60 or higher for desktop and mobile (Android webview and Chrome for Android) Opera 47 or higher for desktop Opera 44 or higher for Android mobile Samsung Internet for mobile largestContentfulPaint Chrome 77 or higher for desktop and mobile firstInteraction firstInputDelay These metrics require the addEventListener browser API.

Compatibility matrix via MDN documentation. windowUnload This metric is currently supported by all browsers on desktop and mobile. Compatibility matrix via MDN documentation. CumulativeLayoutShift Cumulative Layout Shift (CLS) is a metric measuring the stability of the content on a webpage. For a complete description, see web.dev/cls. How is CLS captured in New Relic Shifts in page layout as reported by the Layout Instability API are aggregated throughout the life of the page and reported as an attribute on all PageViewTiming events, representing the CLS value when that event occurred. Using this model, users can look at their CLS value at different points in the page's life; for example, CLS values up until the first-time users interact with the page or hide the page. Approximating other CLS sources Lighthouse captures CLS value only up to the time when a page is loaded, which is useful in a development or lab environment. You can approximate Lighthouse values by looking at the windowLoad PageViewTiming event. CrUX report uses values captured over the lifespan of the page, which is useful to analyze worst-case shifts in a RUM environment. You can approximate CrUX values by looking at the CLS attribute on the windowUnload PageViewTiming event. These values will not be exactly the same because of different sample sets and a difference in how values from long-lived web pages are included. The New Relic browser monitoring agent captures CLS when the page unloads, while CrUX collects and updates the metric throughout the lifespan of the page. How CLS is aggregated As of July 2021, Google has updated the way CLS values are aggregated. Browser monitoring agent versions v12xx use the method described in Evolving the CLS metric. Browser monitoring agent v12xx or higher: Layout shift values are captured in windows. Layout shifts that occurred within 1 second of each other, but no more than 5 seconds between the first and last shift, are part of the same window. A CLS score represents the sum of layout shift values from the window with the highest sum of layout shift values. Prior to Browser agent v12xx: A CLS score represents the sum of all layout shifts that occurred up until that point in the page's life.

      "body": "This document explains: How a web page loads How browser monitoring measures page load timing, also known as real user monitoring (RUM) Tip This is a description of traditional, synchronous page load timing. Browser can also monitor asynchronous page load timing. Page load process Here are the major steps in the loading of most web pages. The numbers 1-6 in the diagram correspond to the numbered steps below. Page load timeline: The steps involved in a web page load. Browser monitoring charts display the following segments of that process: Network, Web application, DOM processing, and Page rendering. A page load begins when a user selects a hyperlink, submits a form, or types a URL in a browser. This is also referred to as the initial request or the navigation start. The user's action sends a request across the network to the web application server. The request reaches the application for processing. (The request may take some time to start being processed. This could be the result of request queuing or it could be other factors.) The app finishes processing and sends an HTML response back across the network to the user's browser. This is sometimes referred to as response start or first byte. (Time To First Byte) The user's browser begins receiving the HTML response, and starts to process the Document Object Model, or DOM. The DOM finishes loading; this point is known as DOM ready. Using the DOM, the user's browser starts to render the page. The page finishes rendering in the user's browser and the window load event fires. (For pages that use asynchronous loading, some elements may continue to load after the window load event occurs.) Page load time charts in browser monitoring Browser monitoring captures the major page load timing segments in the browser Summary page and the Page views page. If you have SPA monitoring enabled, you will have access to both this chart and SPA-specific charts. The charts show: Network Web application time DOM processing Page rendering Other segments as applicable, such as request queuing The chart colors match the colors in the page load timing diagram. one.newrelic.com > Browser > (select an app) > Summary: The load time chart appears on the Summary and Page views page. The way browser collects these times depends on the browser's capability to use the Navigation Timing Specification API. You can add custom page load timing events with the browser agent API. Here are descriptions of the activity included in the browser load time chart segments: Web application The web application time includes the time spent on the application server. This can only be determined if the browser instrumentation for page load timing was provided by an APM agent. Network The Network layer includes time spent in redirects as well as in requesting and receiving HTML. It does not include time on the server or for static assets. Network time measurement starts from the initial click on a link. Network time includes DNS and may include more than one lookup if you have redirects on your site, TCP (including the firewall, unless you have configured request queue time monitoring), and SSL connect time. If you have configured request queue time monitoring, then the network time does not include any of the request queue time that occurs after the X-Request header. If you have not configured request queue time monitoring, then the network time does include all of the request queue time. The Navigation Timing Specification API provides a detailed breakdown of network time. (For old browsers, the timer starts on the \"before unload event.\") For apps that have been deployed using the copy/paste method, Browser includes web app and queue time in Network time. This is because browser relies on the server-side agent to pass the application values to the browser agent through auto-injection. For more information about how this back-end time breaks down from the browser's point of view, use the Session traces page. The session traces report on all the network related events available, so you can see on a case-by-case basis how the browser is spending time on DNS lookups and other network events. Important Even with request queuing configured, the front-end server's setup can still affect network time. This is because the front-end server does not add the queueing time header until after it actually accepts and processes the request. If the front-end server is configured in some way that causes requests to start backlogging and to queue up in the listener socket that the front-end server uses to accept connections, then you will see network time increase for browser monitoring. The queueing time headers can never account for backlog in this listener socket. DOM processing DOM processing is the time it takes to parse the HTML into a DOM and retrieve or execute synchronous scripts. If the browser starts to download images in this phase, page load timing will capture the image load time. The DOM processing and page rendering layers include network time for static assets (assets that are not explicitly retrieved after page load). However, if a script on the page dynamically inserts image tags and loads images after the server or content delivery system (CDN) finishes, page load timing cannot capture the image load time. Page rendering The Page rendering phase is the time between the DOM being complete and the window load event. This phase measures browser-side processing of the page content, and often includes time for scripts and static assets to load. Request queuing Request queuing will be displayed in the load time chart if your account has both browser and APM linked. In New Relic, request queuing refers to the time between a request entering your production systems and it reaching your application. Depending on the specifics of your production infrastructure, this time may include an actual queue that requests enter, or it may represent other functions that take time (such as load balancing or internal network latency). App server requests vs. browser transactions Often the number of app server transactions (requests per minute or rpm) is larger than the number of browser transactions (pages per minute or ppm) for the same application. For more information, see the troubleshooting procedures. Outliers No matter how well your application performs, there will be some slow browsers, platforms, and networks that make your overall aggregate response times appear slower. To minimize the skew caused by outliers, page load timing clamps and scales the end user response times that are greater than 4.5 times your application's browser Apdex T setting to 4.5 times the Apdex T, or to 13.5 seconds, whichever is greater. (Histogram outliers are cut off at 95%.) For example, if your application's end user Apdex T threshold is 8 seconds, those response times will be clamped at 36 seconds. This minimizes the impact of these response times on your overall application but still provides accounting for \"frustrated\" Apdex scores. For SPA monitoring, outliers are handled differently. When the duration of an initial page load or route change reaches 30 minutes, that event is treated as invalid data and is discarded.",

      "body": "Browser monitoring's PageViewTiming event sends each data point as a separate event as soon as it is available. Because we do not restrict the timing, you can receive first paint or first interaction data regardless of when it fires. This document describes why and how to use PageViewTiming and its attributes to query data about your site, component loading, and user performance metrics, both from visual and responsiveness standpoints. Why use PageViewTiming? If your application uses asynchronous or dynamic pages, you may need additional details about site or component loading. But pages can load content in many different ways, and users control when they interact with that content. This is why some user-centric performance metrics happen outside the standard window onload (page load time) in the browser agent. For example, users may become impatient and begin clicking as soon as content is on the webpage. Or, they may wait to use the page until long after content is loaded. The PageViewTiming event provides a more real-time delivery mechanism that does not have a dependency on any other event. The additional metrics can help you understand how users experience your site, both from visual and responsiveness standpoints. Support for Google's Core Web Vitals As of agent version 1177 for browser monitoring, we have full support for Google's Core Web Vitals for 2020. The metrics that make up Core Web Vitals will evolve over time. The current set for 2020 focuses on three aspects of the user experience: loading, interactivity, and visual stability. This includes the following metrics and their respective thresholds: Core Web Vitals metrics include loading, interactivity, and visual stability. Largest Contentful Paint (LCP): measures loading performance. To provide a good user experience, LCP should occur within 2.5 seconds of when the page first starts loading. First Input Delay (FID): measures interactivity. To provide a good user experience, pages should have a FID of less than 100 milliseconds. Cumulative Layout Shift (CLS): measures visual stability. To provide a good user experience, pages should maintain a CLS of less than 0.1. For each of these metrics, to ensure you're hitting the recommended target for most of your users, a good threshold to measure is the 75th percentile of page loads, segmented across mobile and desktop devices. To learn more, watch our Nerd Days talk on perceived performance. Detailed visual, interactivity, and responsiveness metrics The BrowserInteraction and PageView events end their reporting when they receive the page window load (or window load and AJAX) timing. However, paint and interactivity metrics can happen at any time. PageViewTiming delivers these metrics as a separate event to: Account for the variability in this timing. Avoid setting an arbitrary timeout. Prevent holding BrowserInteraction and PageView events indefinitely. Additional data Comments firstPaint and firstContentfulPaint The firstPaint and firstContentfulPaint attributes already are available with BrowserInteraction and PageView events. However, they are not always reliably captured before the window onload event fires. Using PageViewTiming gives you a way to capture these metrics even if they happen after the original page load time. This gives you a better understanding of the correlation between responsiveness of that load event and the visual rendering of your content. largestContentfulPaint The largestContentfulPaint,metric is available with agent version 1163 or higher. It reports the render time of the largest content element visible in the viewport. Google's research found that looking at when the largest element was rendered was a more accurate way to measure when the main content of a page is loaded and useful. For more information about this metric, including limitations and considerations, see the w3c draft. We also report the cumulative layout shift (CLS) score attribute with LCP. This attribute is reported as cumulativeLayoutShift. Largest Contentful Paint is one of three metrics identified by Google as the Core Web Vitals. LCP values up to 2.5 secs are considered \"Good,\" between 2.5-4.0 secs are considered \"Needs Improvement,\" and above 4.0 secs are considered \"Poor.\" firstInteraction and firstInputDelay With the addition of firstInteraction and firstInputDelay, you can quickly determine the ways that your users are interacting with that visual content. These metrics tell you not only when they interacted, but what type of interaction (mousedown, pointerdown, etc.) and how long it took for them to receive a response from your site. The firstInputDelay metric lies in the middle of FirstContentfulPaint and Time to Interactive (TTI) metrics. It measures the time between when a first input can be made and when the browser's main thread is able to respond to any interactions. We also report the cumulative layout shift (CLS) score attribute at the moment of the user's first interaction. This attribute is reported as cumulativeLayoutShift. First Input Delay is one of three metrics identified by Google as the Core Web Vitals. FID values up to 100 ms are considered \"Good,\" between 100-300 ms are considered \"Needs Improvement,\" and above 300 ms are considered \"Poor.\" For a more detailed explanation, see our browser monitoring release notes. cumulativeLayoutShift Cumulative Layout Shift (CLS) is available with agent v1177 or higher. CLS is an important, user-centric metric for measuring visual stability because it helps quantify how often users experience unexpected layout shifts. A low CLS helps ensure that the page is delightful. This is one of three metrics identified by Google as the Core Web Vitals. Cumulative Layout Shift is one of three metrics identified by Google as the Core Web Vitals. CLS scores up to 0.1 are considered \"Good,\" between 0.1-0.25 are considered \"Needs Improvement,\" and above 0.25 are considered \"Poor.\" timingName You can review different types of activities with the timingName attribute, such as firstPaint, firstContentfulPaint, firstInteraction, largestContentfulPaint, pageHide and windowUnload. For example, a PageViewTiming event may have a timingName of firstPaint and a firstPaint value of .03. The event will also include all default attributes included with the standard BrowserInteraction and PageView events. elementId This is the Id, if specified, of the largestContentfulPaint element. This value will only be reported with the LCP metric. This value can be null. elementSize This is the reported size of the largestContentfulPaint element. This value will only be reported with the LCP metric. pageHide The pageHide event, available with agent v1177 or higher, is sent when the browser hides the current page in the process of presenting a different page from the session's history. For example, when the user clicks the browser's Back button, the current page receives a pageHide event before the previous page is shown. For supporting documentation and browser compatibility for the pageHide event, see the MDN Web Docs site. We also report the cumulative layout shift (CLS) score attribute with pageHide. This attribute is reported as cumulativeLayoutShift. windowLoad The windowLoad event is available with agent v1177 or higher. This is fired when the whole page has loaded, including all dependent resources such as stylesheets and images. For supporting documentation and browser compatibility for the windowLoad event, see the MDN Web Docs site. We also report the cumulative layout shift (CLS) score attribute with windowLoad. This attribute is reported as cumulativeLayoutShift. windowUnload The windowUnload event is available with agent v1163 or higher. This is fired when a document or child resource is being unloaded. For supporting documentation and browser compatibility for the windowUnload event, see the MDN Web Docs site. We also report the cumulative layout shift (CLS) score attribute with windowUnload. This attribute is reported as cumulativeLayoutShift. Compatibility and requirements Requirements: Meets install requirements. Reporting of this event requires browser agent version 1153 or higher and a Pro or Pro+SPA agent. Follow our Browser agent release notes to find out when new metrics are released. These metrics are supported by the following browser versions. For unsupported browsers, no PageViewTiming events will be recorded. Metrics Supported browser versions cumulativeLayoutShift Chrome 79 Metric is elevated to stable; changes in metric definition will be reported in this log. Chrome 77 Metric exposed via API: Cumulative Layout Shift available via Layout Instability API firstPaint firstContentfulPaint Chrome 60 or higher for desktop and mobile (Android webview and Chrome for Android) Opera 47 or higher for desktop Opera 44 or higher for Android mobile Samsung Internet for mobile largestContentfulPaint Chrome 77 or higher for desktop and mobile firstInteraction firstInputDelay These metrics require the addEventListener browser API. This API is available in all modern browsers, including: Apple Safari Google Chrome Microsoft Internet Explorer (IE) versions 9 or higher Mozilla Firefox pageHide This metric is currently supported by all browsers on desktop and mobile. Compatibility matrix via MDN documentation. windowLoad This metric is currently supported by all browsers on desktop and mobile. Compatibility matrix via MDN documentation. windowUnload This metric is currently supported by all browsers on desktop and mobile. Compatibility matrix via MDN documentation. CumulativeLayoutShift Cumulative Layout Shift (CLS) is a metric measuring the stability of the content on a webpage. For a complete description, see web.dev/cls. How is CLS captured in New Relic Shifts in page layout as reported by the Layout Instability API are aggregated throughout the life of the page and reported as an attribute on all PageViewTiming events, representing the CLS value when that event occurred. Using this model, users can look at their CLS value at different points in the page's life; for example, CLS values up until the first-time users interact with the page or hide the page. Approximating other CLS sources Lighthouse captures CLS value only up to the time when a page is loaded, which is useful in a development or lab environment. You can approximate Lighthouse values by looking at the windowLoad PageViewTiming event. CrUX report uses values captured over the lifespan of the page, which is useful to analyze worst-case shifts in a RUM environment. You can approximate CrUX values by looking at the CLS attribute on the windowUnload PageViewTiming event. These values will not be exactly the same because of different sample sets and a difference in how values from long-lived web pages are included. The New Relic browser monitoring agent captures CLS when the page unloads, while CrUX collects and updates the metric throughout the lifespan of the page. How CLS is aggregated As of July 2021, Google has updated the way CLS values are aggregated. Browser monitoring agent versions v12xx use the method described in Evolving the CLS metric. Browser monitoring agent v12xx or higher: Layout shift values are captured in windows. Layout shifts that occurred within 1 second of each other, but no more than 5 seconds between the first and last shift, are part of the same window. A CLS score represents the sum of layout shift values from the window with the highest sum of layout shift values. Prior to Browser agent v12xx: A CLS score represents the sum of all layout shifts that occurred up until that point in the page's life. Query your event data Here are some sample queries for the event data to help you get started.

Because we do not restrict the timing, you can receive first paint or first interaction data regardless of when it fires. This document describes why and how to use PageViewTiming and its attributes to query data about your site, component loading, and user performance metrics, both from visual and responsiveness standpoints. Why use PageViewTiming? If your application uses asynchronous or dynamic pages, you may need additional details about site or component loading. But pages can load content in many different ways, and users control when they interact with that content. This is why some user-centric performance metrics happen outside the standard window onload (page load time) in the browser agent. For example, users may become impatient and begin clicking as soon as content is on the webpage. Or, they may wait to use the page until long after content is loaded. The PageViewTiming event provides a more real-time delivery mechanism that does not have a dependency on any other event. The additional metrics can help you understand how users experience your site, both from visual and responsiveness standpoints. Support for Google's Core Web Vitals As of agent version 1177 for browser monitoring, we have full support for Google's Core Web Vitals for 2020. The metrics that make up Core Web Vitals will evolve over time. The current set for 2020 focuses on three aspects of the user experience: loading, interactivity, and visual stability. This includes the following metrics and their respective thresholds: Core Web Vitals metrics include loading, interactivity, and visual stability. Largest Contentful Paint (LCP): measures loading performance. To provide a good user experience, LCP should occur within 2.5 seconds of when the page first starts loading. First Input Delay (FID): measures interactivity. To provide a good user experience, pages should have a FID of less than 100 milliseconds. Cumulative Layout Shift (CLS): measures visual stability. To provide a good user experience, pages should maintain a CLS of less than 0.1. For each of these metrics, to ensure you're hitting the recommended target for most of your users, a good threshold to measure is the 75th percentile of page loads, segmented across mobile and desktop devices. To learn more, watch our Nerd Days talk on perceived performance. Detailed visual, interactivity, and responsiveness metrics The BrowserInteraction and PageView events end their reporting when they receive the page window load (or window load and AJAX) timing. However, paint and interactivity metrics can happen at any time. PageViewTiming delivers these metrics as a separate event to: Account for the variability in this timing. Avoid setting an arbitrary timeout. Prevent holding BrowserInteraction and PageView events indefinitely. Additional data Comments firstPaint and firstContentfulPaint The firstPaint and firstContentfulPaint attributes already are available with BrowserInteraction and PageView events. However, they are not always reliably captured before the window onload event fires. Using PageViewTiming gives you a way to capture these metrics even if they happen after the original page load time. This gives you a better understanding of the correlation between responsiveness of that load event and the visual rendering of your content. largestContentfulPaint The largestContentfulPaint,metric is available with agent version 1163 or higher. It reports the render time of the largest content element visible in the viewport. Google's research found that looking at when the largest element was rendered was a more accurate way to measure when the main content of a page is loaded and useful. For more information about this metric, including limitations and considerations, see the w3c draft. We also report the cumulative layout shift (CLS) score attribute with LCP. This attribute is reported as cumulativeLayoutShift. Largest Contentful Paint is one of three metrics identified by Google as the Core Web Vitals. LCP values up to 2.5 secs are considered \"Good,\" between 2.5-4.0 secs are considered \"Needs Improvement,\" and above 4.0 secs are considered \"Poor.\" firstInteraction and firstInputDelay With the addition of firstInteraction and firstInputDelay, you can quickly determine the ways that your users are interacting with that visual content. These metrics tell you not only when they interacted, but what type of interaction (mousedown, pointerdown, etc.) and how long it took for them to receive a response from your site. The firstInputDelay metric lies in the middle of FirstContentfulPaint and Time to Interactive (TTI) metrics. It measures the time between when a first input can be made and when the browser's main thread is able to respond to any interactions. We also report the cumulative layout shift (CLS) score attribute at the moment of the user's first interaction. This attribute is reported as cumulativeLayoutShift. First Input Delay is one of three metrics identified by Google as the Core Web Vitals. FID values up to 100 ms are considered \"Good,\" between 100-300 ms are considered \"Needs Improvement,\" and above 300 ms are considered \"Poor.\" For a more detailed explanation, see our browser monitoring release notes. cumulativeLayoutShift Cumulative Layout Shift (CLS) is available with agent v1177 or higher. CLS is an important, user-centric metric for measuring visual stability because it helps quantify how often users experience unexpected layout shifts. A low CLS helps ensure that the page is delightful. This is one of three metrics identified by Google as the Core Web Vitals. Cumulative Layout Shift is one of three metrics identified by Google as the Core Web Vitals. CLS scores up to 0.1 are considered \"Good,\" between 0.1-0.25 are considered \"Needs Improvement,\" and above 0.25 are considered \"Poor.\" timingName You can review different types of activities with the timingName attribute, such as firstPaint, firstContentfulPaint, firstInteraction, largestContentfulPaint, pageHide and windowUnload. For example, a PageViewTiming event may have a timingName of firstPaint and a firstPaint value of .03. The event will also include all default attributes included with the standard BrowserInteraction and PageView events. elementId This is the Id, if specified, of the largestContentfulPaint element. This value will only be reported with the LCP metric. This value can be null. elementSize This is the reported size of the largestContentfulPaint element. This value will only be reported with the LCP metric. pageHide The pageHide event, available with agent v1177 or higher, is sent when the browser hides the current page in the process of presenting a different page from the session's history. For example, when the user clicks the browser's Back button, the current page receives a pageHide event before the previous page is shown. For supporting documentation and browser compatibility for the pageHide event, see the MDN Web Docs site. We also report the cumulative layout shift (CLS) score attribute with pageHide. This attribute is reported as cumulativeLayoutShift. windowLoad The windowLoad event is available with agent v1177 or higher. This is fired when the whole page has loaded, including all dependent resources such as stylesheets and images. For supporting documentation and browser compatibility for the windowLoad event, see the MDN Web Docs site. We also report the cumulative layout shift (CLS) score attribute with windowLoad. This attribute is reported as cumulativeLayoutShift. windowUnload The windowUnload event is available with agent v1163 or higher. This is fired when a document or child resource is being unloaded. For supporting documentation and browser compatibility for the windowUnload event, see the MDN Web Docs site. We also report the cumulative layout shift (CLS) score attribute with windowUnload. This attribute is reported as cumulativeLayoutShift. Compatibility and requirements Requirements: Meets install requirements. Reporting of this event requires browser agent version 1153 or higher and a Pro or Pro+SPA agent. Follow our Browser agent release notes to find out when new metrics are released. These metrics are supported by the following browser versions. For unsupported browsers, no PageViewTiming events will be recorded. Metrics Supported browser versions cumulativeLayoutShift Chrome 79 Metric is elevated to stable; changes in metric definition will be reported in this log. Chrome 77 Metric exposed via API: Cumulative Layout Shift available via Layout Instability API firstPaint firstContentfulPaint Chrome 60 or higher for desktop and mobile (Android webview and Chrome for Android) Opera 47 or higher for desktop Opera 44 or higher for Android mobile Samsung Internet for mobile largestContentfulPaint Chrome 77 or higher for desktop and mobile firstInteraction firstInputDelay These metrics require the addEventListener browser API. This API is available in all modern browsers, including: Apple Safari Google Chrome Microsoft Internet Explorer (IE) versions 9 or higher Mozilla Firefox pageHide This metric is currently supported by all browsers on desktop and mobile.

CumulativeLayoutShift Cumulative Layout Shift (CLS) is a metric measuring the stability of the content on a webpage. For a complete description, see web.dev/cls. How is CLS captured in New Relic Shifts in page layout as reported by the Layout Instability API are aggregated throughout the life of the page and reported as an attribute on all PageViewTiming events, representing the CLS value when that event occurred. Using this model, users can look at their CLS value at different points in the page's life; for example, CLS values up until the first-time users interact with the page or hide the page. Approximating other CLS sources Lighthouse captures CLS value only up to the time when a page is loaded, which is useful in a development or lab environment. You can approximate Lighthouse values by looking at the windowLoad PageViewTiming event. CrUX report uses values captured over the lifespan of the page, which is useful to analyze worst-case shifts in a RUM environment. You can approximate CrUX values by looking at the CLS attribute on the windowUnload PageViewTiming event. These values will not be exactly the same because of different sample sets and a difference in how values from long-lived web pages are included. The New Relic browser monitoring agent captures CLS when the page unloads, while CrUX collects and updates the metric throughout the lifespan of the page. How CLS is aggregated As of July 2021, Google has updated the way CLS values are aggregated. Browser monitoring agent versions v12xx use the method described in Evolving the CLS metric. Browser monitoring agent v12xx or higher: Layout shift values are captured in windows. Layout shifts that occurred within 1 second of each other, but no more than 5 seconds between the first and last shift, are part of the same window. A CLS score represents the sum of layout shift values from the window with the highest sum of layout shift values. Prior to Browser agent v12xx: A CLS score represents the sum of all layout shifts that occurred up until that point in the page's life.

CLS scores up to 0.1 are considered \"Good,\" between 0.1-0.25 are considered \"Needs Improvement,\" and above 0.25 are considered \"Poor.\" timingName You can review different types of activities with the timingName attribute, such as firstPaint, firstContentfulPaint, firstInteraction, largestContentfulPaint, pageHide and windowUnload. For example, a PageViewTiming event may have a timingName of firstPaint and a firstPaint value of .03. The event will also include all default attributes included with the standard BrowserInteraction and PageView events. elementId This is the Id, if specified, of the largestContentfulPaint element. This value will only be reported with the LCP metric. This value can be null. elementSize This is the reported size of the largestContentfulPaint element. This value will only be reported with the LCP metric. pageHide The pageHide event, available with agent v1177 or higher, is sent when the browser hides the current page in the process of presenting a different page from the session's history. For example, when the user clicks the browser's Back button, the current page receives a pageHide event before the previous page is shown. For supporting documentation and browser compatibility for the pageHide event, see the MDN Web Docs site. We also report the cumulative layout shift (CLS) score attribute with pageHide. This attribute is reported as cumulativeLayoutShift. windowLoad The windowLoad event is available with agent v1177 or higher. This is fired when the whole page has loaded, including all dependent resources such as stylesheets and images. For supporting documentation and browser compatibility for the windowLoad event, see the MDN Web Docs site. We also report the cumulative layout shift (CLS) score attribute with windowLoad. This attribute is reported as cumulativeLayoutShift. windowUnload The windowUnload event is available with agent v1163 or higher. This is fired when a document or child resource is being unloaded. For supporting documentation and browser compatibility for the windowUnload event, see the MDN Web Docs site. We also report the cumulative layout shift (CLS) score attribute with windowUnload. This attribute is reported as cumulativeLayoutShift. Compatibility and requirements Requirements: Meets install requirements. Reporting of this event requires browser agent version 1153 or higher and a Pro or Pro+SPA agent. Follow our Browser agent release notes to find out when new metrics are released. These metrics are supported by the following browser versions. For unsupported browsers, no PageViewTiming events will be recorded. Metrics Supported browser versions cumulativeLayoutShift Chrome 79 Metric is elevated to stable; changes in metric definition will be reported in this log. Chrome 77 Metric exposed via API: Cumulative Layout Shift available via Layout Instability API firstPaint firstContentfulPaint Chrome 60 or higher for desktop and mobile (Android webview and Chrome for Android) Opera 47 or higher for desktop Opera 44 or higher for Android mobile Samsung Internet for mobile largestContentfulPaint Chrome 77 or higher for desktop and mobile firstInteraction firstInputDelay These metrics require the addEventListener browser API. This API is available in all modern browsers, including: Apple Safari Google Chrome Microsoft Internet Explorer (IE) versions 9 or higher Mozilla Firefox pageHide This metric is currently supported by all browsers on desktop and mobile.

Compatibility matrix via MDN documentation. windowUnload This metric is currently supported by all browsers on desktop and mobile. Compatibility matrix via MDN documentation. CumulativeLayoutShift Cumulative Layout Shift (CLS) is a metric measuring the stability of the content on a webpage. For a complete description, see web.dev/cls. How is CLS captured in New Relic Shifts in page layout as reported by the Layout Instability API are aggregated throughout the life of the page and reported as an attribute on all PageViewTiming events, representing the CLS value when that event occurred. Using this model, users can look at their CLS value at different points in the page's life; for example, CLS values up until the first-time users interact with the page or hide the page. Approximating other CLS sources Lighthouse captures CLS value only up to the time when a page is loaded, which is useful in a development or lab environment. You can approximate Lighthouse values by looking at the windowLoad PageViewTiming event. CrUX report uses values captured over the lifespan of the page, which is useful to analyze worst-case shifts in a RUM environment. You can approximate CrUX values by looking at the CLS attribute on the windowUnload PageViewTiming event. These values will not be exactly the same because of different sample sets and a difference in how values from long-lived web pages are included. The New Relic browser monitoring agent captures CLS when the page unloads, while CrUX collects and updates the metric throughout the lifespan of the page. How CLS is aggregated As of July 2021, Google has updated the way CLS values are aggregated. Browser monitoring agent versions v12xx use the method described in Evolving the CLS metric. Browser monitoring agent v12xx or higher: Layout shift values are captured in windows. Layout shifts that occurred within 1 second of each other, but no more than 5 seconds between the first and last shift, are part of the same window. A CLS score represents the sum of layout shift values from the window with the highest sum of layout shift values. Prior to Browser agent v12xx: A CLS score represents the sum of all layout shifts that occurred up until that point in the page's life. Query your event data Here are some sample queries for the event data to help you get started. Percentile over timeseries Show the 95th percentile of first paint and first contentful paint over a time series: SELECT FILTER(percentile(firstPaint, 95), where(timingName = ' firstPaint ')) as 'fp', FILTER(percentile( firstContentfulPaint , 95), where(timingName = 'firstContentfulPaint')) as 'fcp' FROM PageViewTiming TIMESERIES 1 minute SINCE 1 hour ago Copy Percentile by transaction and interaction Show the 95th percentile of first input delay over a time series, faceted by transaction name and interaction type: SELECT percentile( firstInputDelay , 95) as 'fid' FROM PageViewTiming WHERE timingName = 'firstInteraction' TIMESERIES 1 minute FACET browserTransactionName, interactionType SINCE 3 hours ago Copy Histogram of delay timings Show a histogram of first input delay timings faceted by first interaction time ranges: FROM PageViewTiming SELECT histogram( firstInputDelay , 1000, 10) SINCE 3 hours ago WHERE timingName = 'firstInteraction' FACET CASES (WHERE firstInteraction < 1, WHERE firstInteraction >= 1 AND firstInteraction < 5, WHERE firstInteraction >= 5) Copy",

The name will be exposed as the browserInteractionName attribute in the BrowserInteraction event. It will also be used for grouping in the UI. By default, browserInteractionName is named after an associated URL or route. Use setName() when you want to record an interaction that is not a route change or URL change. The setCurrentRouteName() method also names the current route. When you use both: setName() takes precedence for naming the interaction. The previousRouteName and targetRouteName attributes are still set with values passed to setCurrentRouteName(). Using these methods together allows many options for filtering and grouping in the UI. For example, you can: Filter down to interactions of a certain type, such as LikeButtonClick. Then, group by targetRouteName to see what routes have the most LikeButtonClick interactions.

Requirements Agent version nr-963 or higher. Description This SPA monitoring method sets the name and trigger of a browser interaction. The name will be exposed as the browserInteractionName attribute in the BrowserInteraction event. It will also be used for grouping in the UI. By default, browserInteractionName is named after an associated URL or route. Use setName() when you want to record an interaction that is not a route change or URL change. The setCurrentRouteName() method also names the current route. When you use both: setName() takes precedence for naming the interaction. The previousRouteName and targetRouteName attributes are still set with values passed to setCurrentRouteName(). Using these methods together allows many options for filtering and grouping in the UI. For example, you can: Filter down to interactions of a certain type, such as LikeButtonClick. Then, group by targetRouteName to see what routes have the most LikeButtonClick interactions. Tip This API call applies to data in SPA page views in browser and the BrowserInteraction event type within New Relic One. To set a custom name for standard page views and the PageView event type, see setPageViewName. Using both calls together is recommended. Parameters Parameter Description $name string Required. If null, the name will be set using the targetGroupedUrl attribute. If not null, this will set the browserInteractionName attribute in the BrowserInteraction event. $trigger string Optional. If not null, this will set the TRIGGER attribute on the BrowserInteraction event. Return values This method returns the same API object created by interaction().

This event will appear in the browser session trace details. If a session trace currently is in progress, this adds an object with a user-defined name, start time, and other optional fields. If you make this call and a session trace is not already in progress, this will not cause browser to capture a trace.

Parameters Parameter Description $custom_object JavaScript object Required. Supply a JavaScript object with these required and optional name/value pairs: Required name/value pairs: NAME, START Optional name/value pairs: END, ORIGIN, TYPE If you are sending the same event object to New Relic One as a PageAction, omit the TYPE attribute. (TYPE is a string to describe what type of event you are marking inside of a session trace.) If included, it will override the event type and cause the PageAction event to be sent incorrectly.

Make this call before the window load event fires (when that data is transmitted) in order for the attributes to be included in the PageView event.

Requirements Agent version nr-593 or higher. Description Adds a user-defined attribute name and value to subsequent events on the page. Make this call before the window load event fires (when that data is transmitted) in order for the attributes to be included in the PageView event.

The name will be exposed as the browserInteractionName attribute in the BrowserInteraction event. It will also be used for grouping in the UI.

Make this call before the window load event fires (when that data is transmitted) in order for the attributes to be included in the PageView event.

Requirements Agent version nr-593 or higher. Description Adds a user-defined attribute name and value to subsequent events on the page. Make this call before the window load event fires (when that data is transmitted) in order for the attributes to be included in the PageView event. Once an attribute is set, New Relic One records it with all PageAction events until the page is reloaded or the attribute is manually unset.

However, attributes set using the SPA API will take precedence over these attributes. Errors for custom attributes will be included in events on the JS Errors page. To view or log errors for a custom attribute via API, use the browser API's noticeError call. Parameters Parameter Description $name string Required. Name of the attribute. Appears as column in the PageView event. It will also appear as a column in the PageAction event if you are using it. Avoid using reserved NRQL words when you name the attribute/value. $value string OR integer Required. Value of the attribute. Appears as the value in the named attribute column in the PageView event.

The name will be exposed as the browserInteractionName attribute in the BrowserInteraction event. It will also be used for grouping in the UI. By default, browserInteractionName is named after an associated URL or route. Use setName() when you want to record an interaction that is not a route change or URL change. The setCurrentRouteName() method also names the current route. When you use both: setName() takes precedence for naming the interaction. The previousRouteName and targetRouteName attributes are still set with values passed to setCurrentRouteName(). Using these methods together allows many options for filtering and grouping in the UI. For example, you can: Filter down to interactions of a certain type, such as LikeButtonClick. Then, group by targetRouteName to see what routes have the most LikeButtonClick interactions. Tip This API call applies to data in SPA page views in browser and the BrowserInteraction event type within New Relic One. To set a custom name for standard page views and the PageView event type, see setPageViewName. Using both calls together is recommended. Parameters Parameter Description $name string Required.

To view or log errors for a custom attribute via API, use the browser API's noticeError call. Parameters Parameter Description $name string Required. Name of the attribute. Appears as column in the PageView event. It will also appear as a column in the PageAction event if you are using it. Avoid using reserved NRQL words when you name the attribute/value. $value string OR integer Required. Value of the attribute. Appears as the value in the named attribute column in the PageView event. It will appear as a column in the PageAction event if you are using it. Custom attribute values cannot be complex objects, only simple types such as Strings and Integers. Avoid using reserved NRQL words when you name the attribute/value. Examples Get JavaScript/jQuery for HTML elements This example uses JavaScript/jQuery to get the values of the following HTML elements on a Drupal-generated page: <link rel=\"shortlink\" href=\"/node/1111\" /> <h1>Using NRQL</h1> New Relic reports them as custom attributes. This is useful to query PageView and PageAction events in New Relic One. var node_id = ''; node_id= jQuery(\"link[rel='shortlink']\").attr(\"href\"); var node_title = ''; node_title= jQuery('h1').text(); if (typeof newrelic == 'object') { newrelic.setCustomAttribute('nodeId', node_id); newrelic.setCustomAttribute('title', node_title); } Copy",

Requirements Agent version nr-963 or higher. Description This SPA monitoring method sets the name and trigger of a browser interaction. The name will be exposed as the browserInteractionName attribute in the BrowserInteraction event. It will also be used for grouping in the UI. By default, browserInteractionName is named after an associated URL or route. Use setName() when you want to record an interaction that is not a route change or URL change. The setCurrentRouteName() method also names the current route. When you use both: setName() takes precedence for naming the interaction. The previousRouteName and targetRouteName attributes are still set with values passed to setCurrentRouteName(). Using these methods together allows many options for filtering and grouping in the UI. For example, you can: Filter down to interactions of a certain type, such as LikeButtonClick. Then, group by targetRouteName to see what routes have the most LikeButtonClick interactions. Tip This API call applies to data in SPA page views in browser and the BrowserInteraction event type within New Relic One. To set a custom name for standard page views and the PageView event type, see setPageViewName. Using both calls together is recommended. Parameters Parameter Description $name string Required.

The name will be exposed as the browserInteractionName attribute in the BrowserInteraction event. It will also be used for grouping in the UI.

The previousRouteName and targetRouteName attributes are still set with values passed to setCurrentRouteName(). Using these methods together allows many options for filtering and grouping in the UI. For example, you can: Filter down to interactions of a certain type, such as LikeButtonClick. Then, group by targetRouteName to see what routes have the most LikeButtonClick interactions.

Requirements Agent version nr-593 or higher. Description Adds a user-defined attribute name and value to subsequent events on the page. Make this call before the window load event fires (when that data is transmitted) in order for the attributes to be included in the PageView event. Once an attribute is set, New Relic One records it with all PageAction events until the page is reloaded or the attribute is manually unset. If you are using SPA monitoring with a compatible agent version, attributes set with this call will also be included in newrelic.interaction events. However, attributes set using the SPA API will take precedence over these attributes. Errors for custom attributes will be included in events on the JS Errors page. To view or log errors for a custom attribute via API, use the browser API's noticeError call. Parameters Parameter Description $name string Required. Name of the attribute. Appears as column in the PageView event. It will also appear as a column in the PageAction event if you are using it. Avoid using reserved NRQL words when you name the attribute/value. $value string OR integer Required. Value of the attribute. Appears as the value in the named attribute column in the PageView event. It will appear as a column in the PageAction event if you are using it. Custom attribute values cannot be complex objects, only simple types such as Strings and Integers. Avoid using reserved NRQL words when you name the attribute/value.

Other methods for modifying the interaction include: setName() save() ignore() setAttribute() Parameters Parameter Description $callback function Required. This function is called when the interaction ends. It is called with one parameter, which is the interaction context. Return values This method returns the same API object created by interaction(). Examples // router.js router.addRoute('/dashboard', () => { const interaction = newrelic.interaction().onEnd(ctx => { interaction.setAttribute( 'averageChartLoadTime', ctx.totalChartLoadTime / ctx.chartLoadCount ) }) getCharts().forEach(loadChart) }) // chart-loader.js function loadChart (chart) { const start = Date.now() chart.load().then(() => { const loadTime = Date.now() - start interaction.getContext(ctx => { ctx.totalChartLoadTime = (ctx.totalChartLoadTime || 0) + loadTime ctx.chartLoadCount += (ctx.chartLoadCount || 0) + 1 }) } } Copy",

Requirements Agent version nr-963 or higher. Description This SPA monitoring method sets the name and trigger of a browser interaction. The name will be exposed as the browserInteractionName attribute in the BrowserInteraction event. It will also be used for grouping in the UI. By default, browserInteractionName is named after an associated URL or route. Use setName() when you want to record an interaction that is not a route change or URL change. The setCurrentRouteName() method also names the current route. When you use both: setName() takes precedence for naming the interaction. The previousRouteName and targetRouteName attributes are still set with values passed to setCurrentRouteName(). Using these methods together allows many options for filtering and grouping in the UI. For example, you can: Filter down to interactions of a certain type, such as LikeButtonClick. Then, group by targetRouteName to see what routes have the most LikeButtonClick interactions. Tip This API call applies to data in SPA page views in browser and the BrowserInteraction event type within New Relic One. To set a custom name for standard page views and the PageView event type, see setPageViewName. Using both calls together is recommended. Parameters Parameter Description $name string Required. If null, the name will be set using the targetGroupedUrl attribute. If not null, this will set the browserInteractionName attribute in the BrowserInteraction event. $trigger string Optional.

      "popularity": 1,
      "body": "Problem You have enabled distributed tracing but data you expected to see does not appear in New Relic's distributed tracing UI. Solution Important Before performing troubleshooting, we recommend reading How distributed tracing works. Here are some causes and solutions when you have problems finding expected data in the distributed tracing UI: Problems with enabling or instrumenting Missing spans due to service not having distributed tracing enabled In order for distributed tracing to report details for all nodes in a trace, each application must be monitored by a New Relic agent that has had distributed tracing enabled. If an application's New Relic account has not had distributed tracing enabled, it will have these issues: Its distributed tracing UI page won't have data. It won't report data to other accounts' distributed traces. Missing apps/services may require manual instrumentation When you enable distributed tracing for applications and services that New Relic automatically instruments, you'll usually see complete and detailed data for those nodes in the distributed tracing UI. However, you may notice that some services or applications are missing from traces, or that there are some internal spans you expect to see that are missing. If that's the case, you may want to implement custom instrumentation of applications or specific transactions to see more detail in traces. Some examples of when you may need to do this: Transactions not automatically instrumented. To ensure your application is automatically instrumented, read the compatibility and requirements documentation for the New Relic agent you're using. If an application isn't automatically instrumented, or if you'd like to add instrumentation of specific activity, see Custom instrumentation. All Go applications. The Go agent, unlike other agents, requires manual instrumentation of your code. For instructions, see Instrument a Go application. A service doesn't use HTTP. If a service doesn't communicate via HTTP, the New Relic agent won't send distributed tracing headers. This may be the case for some non-web applications or message queues. To remedy this, use the distributed tracing APIs to instrument either the calling or called application. Problems with spans Infinite Tracing: missing spans If your APM agent can’t write data fast enough to the trace observer, queue_size is an additional APM agent configuration to limit the number of spans the agent will hold. See the following examples for your agent: .NET configuration method Example Configuration file <configuration . . . > <infiniteTracing> <trace_observer> <span_events queue_size=\"100000\" /> </trace_observer> </infiniteTracing> </configuration> Copy Environment variable NEW_RELIC_INFINITE_TRACING_SPAN_EVENTS_QUEUE_SIZE=100000 Copy Python configuration method Example Configuration file infinite_tracing.span_queue_size = 100000 Environment Variable NEW_RELIC_INFINITE_TRACING_SPAN_QUEUE_SIZE = 100000 Missing span not getting exported Sometimes header propagation is successful, but the span information isn't getting sent to New Relic. For example, if OpenTelemetry is not instrumented with a New Relic exporter, the span details never make it to New Relic. In this diagram, notice that the header propagation is successful, but no exporter is set up in Service 2 to send the span to New Relic: The following diagram also shows successful header propagation, but it includes an exporter in Service 2 that sends the span details to New Relic (see Trace API): Missing spans due to sampling process Standard distributed tracing for APM uses adaptive sampling. This means that a percentage of calls to a service will be reported as part of a distributed trace. Specific calls to your service might not have been selected to be sampled. Missing spans due to span limits maxed out There are limits on the number of spans that can be collected and displayed. If an application generates a very large number of spans for a single call, it might exceed the APM agent's span-collection limit for that harvest cycle. This could result in missing spans and significantly limit the number of traces the agent can completely sample and report. We currently only show 10,000 spans at a time. Missing spans due to spans being sent late Spans must be sent within the last twenty minutes to be captured in a trace index. If you send any spans older than twenty minutes but newer than a day, the span data will still be written. However, it won't be rolled into the trace index, which controls the trace list in the distributed tracing UI. If a span has a timestamp older than a day, it will be dropped. This often occurs when there is clock skew (timing differences) between systems or long running background jobs. Problems with trace details Middleware doesn't recognize proprietary New Relic header If your transactions are only sending the proprietary New Relic header, some middleware might not recognize the format and then drop the information as shown in this diagram: One solution is to upgrade your New Relic agent to a version that supports W3C trace context. In the diagram below, the W3C-compliant New Relic agent passes the prior header along with two standardized headers: An intermediary is missing or isn't passing trace context Some potential problems with proxies and other intermediaries: Incomplete trace. Some intermediaries won't automatically propagate the distributed tracing header. In that case, you must configure that component to allow the header to be passed from source to destination. For instructions, consult the documentation for that intermediary component. Missing intermediary in trace. If the intermediary is New Relic-monitored, ensure that it propagates the newrelic header that is generated or updated by the New Relic agent running on that intermediary. This may manifest when an intermediary was previously visible in traces, but disappeared after distributed tracing was enabled for an upstream entity (for example, a browser-monitored application). Tip If some entities report trace data to another tracing system, you can use the trace ID from the New Relic UI to search other tracing systems for missing spans. Stitching together spans from mixed sources If each agent in a chain supports W3C Trace Context, then we can stitch the spans together into a complete trace. If part of the chain is from an agent, such as Zipkin, which doesn't support W3C Trace Context, then spans coming from that agent may not be included in the trace. Trace details are obfuscated If a trace contains data from applications monitored by multiple New Relic accounts, and your user permissions don't allow you to access those accounts, some of the span and service details will be obfuscated in the UI. For example, you may see a series of asterisks ( * * * * * ) instead of the service name in your distributed tracing list if you don't have access to the account linked with the service. Trace list information and trace details don't match The trace list is generated by trace indexes, which are captured in a twenty minute window from when the first spans are received. Usually, this is due to late spans. Long traces with short backend times If you're seeing unusually short backend times for long traces, this is likely an issue with the timestamps being sent. For example, the root span might be reposting microseconds as milliseconds. This can also happen if the root span is a browser application. When using an external client like a web browser, you may experience clock skew (timing differences) more often. Problems with browser applications Missing spans and transactions after enabling for a browser application Older versions of some APM agents are incompatible with distributed tracing for browser applications. If the browser application makes an AJAX request to an APM application running an incompatible agent, then the APM agent may not record transaction and span data for that request. If distributed tracing is enabled for a browser application and you are not seeing transaction or span data for downstream APM requests, review the browser data in distributed tracing requirements, and confirm that all applications are running supported versions of the APM agent. Not seeing browser app end-user spans If traces seem to be missing end-user spans, be sure you've read and understand the browser distributed tracing requirements and enable procedures. On the AJAX UI page, there are links to the distributed tracing UI regardless of whether there are end-user spans present in that trace. For details about what data generates spans, see Requirements. Browser spans are not connected to other spans Older versions of some APM agents are incompatible with distributed tracing for browser applications. If APM spans are missing consistently from traces that include browser applications, please refer to the browser data in distributed tracing requirements and confirm that all applications are running supported versions of the APM agent. For other causes of orphaned browser spans, see Browser span reporting. Other problems Search by entity.name not finding associated app names Potential cause: For applications that have multiple app names, the entity.name attribute will be associated only with the primary app name. To search by other app names, search using the appName attribute. Supporting OpenTelemetry Questions about integrating with OpenTelemetry should be taken to the Explorers Hub.",

For our Browser & APM Pro customers, you can now enable the Browser spans for any app that uses our Browser Pro + SPA agent. This MVP includes support for same-origin AJAX requests that originate during a BrowserInteraction event. This AJAX request will be listed as the root entry span for a trace. Learn More For more details about APM & Browser agent version requirements and enablement, see our Browser Data in Distributed Tracing Page. Please note that not all APM agents are supported at this time. For more details about all supported Span attributes, visit our Event Data Dictionary Known Issues Enabling Browser in Distributed Tracing for use with current versions of these language agents, Java, PHP, and C, will result in disconnected traces (single span traces for all Browser requests) and potentially the loss of APM transaction traces and spans. Please see the APM compatibility requirements for supported versions and estimated release dates. New PageViewTiming Event to capture User Centric Perceived Performance metrics in real time With this release, we are tying together the visual and responsiveness performance for our customer's site. With every page view, the agent is now capturing the time of the first interaction along with FID (First Input Delay). The existing paint timing metrics (First Paint and First Contentful Paint) are now collected even when they occur after the load event. All of these new metrics are captured on the new PageViewTiming events, available in Insights. This new event type is available for all agents, but requires a Browser Pro subscription. Visit our New Relic Event Data Dictionary for a list of attributes and more details about the PageViewTiming event. First Interaction First Interaction timing captures the moment in time that a user first engages with a site. Within this timing, we also capture the type of interaction (click, key, mousedown, etc). This timing represents the first step in calculating the First Input Delay, which is the time from First Interaction to the moment that the site responds (is interactive). First Input Delay FID is a metric that tracks the delay between the time a user can attempt to interact with a part of the site (for example, when they click a link, tap on a button, or use a custom, JavaScript-powered control), and the time that the interface is able to respond to that interaction. We have all experienced situations where a webpage has visibly loaded, but when we try to click around on buttons or any JavaScript-powered interactive elements, nothing responds. This delay is what the FID metric tracks. The FID metric is in some ways an intersection of the First Contentful Paint and Time to Interactive metrics. It lies in the middle of those two points, measuring the time between the FCP (and therefore when a first input can be made) and when the browser’s main thread is able to respond to any interactions. One major point of FID that differentiates it from Time to Interactive is that it requires a user to interact! TTI can be calculated without user input, so it is somewhat less powerful in the sense that it isn't providing any new information about my user's active experience or frustration, we can only assume that slow = bad. Why only consider the first input Learn more For more information and query examples, see our PageViewTiming event documentation. For more information about the Paint Timing browser compatibility, see the Browser compatibility and requirements documentation. For more information about User-Centric Perceived Performance metrics, visit the Google Developers Web Fundamentals Guides on Performance. For more information about the difference between FID and TTI, see When Users Click: Tracking First Input Delay Improvements Browser interactions now wait on external scripts to finish loading: Browser interactions measure the time of all Javascript code that runs as a result of an interaction. The agent now includes the time it takes to load and execute external scripts. This is useful, for example, when the code started by an interaction must be loaded first (lazy loading).

      "body": "New Relic's APM Errors page helps you identify, triage, and fix errors in your services. The Errors page uses data collected by the APM agent to display stack traces, transaction attributes such as HTTP header values, and any other custom attributes, so you can understand the context of the error and fix it. Error data types: events and trace details By default, our APM agents collect two type of error data: Events Trace details Events The error event data type includes default attributes, as well as any custom attributes instrumented in your service. It doesn't include a stack trace. Find your events data in the Errors UI as follows: The Errors column in the Error traces table. The Top 5 errors chart. When you’ve drilled into a grouping of errors, those errors not displaying a stack trace are based on this type of data. You can disable Show only errors with stack trace to show errors that have this type of data collected, but no associated trace details. Events are subject to sampling (see Caps on error reporting and Charting error rates and counts). For more on error event data, see Events reported by APM. Trace details The trace details error data type includes stack traces and attributes, and supplements events with more data. It's expected that more events will be reported than trace details--see Caps on error reporting. Find your trace details data in the Errors UI as follows: The “Stack traces” column of the Error traces table. When you’ve drilled into a grouping of errors, those errors with a stack trace use this type of data: Show only errors with stack trace is enabled by default, to constrain the errors shown to just those that have this type of data collected. This data is governed by specific retention rules for Error details. Caps on error reporting New Relic caps error reporting at: 100 events per minute per agent instance 20 trace details per minute per agent instance These caps prevent error reporting from negatively impacting application performance. Examples: App running across five EC2 instances, one JVM each. New Relic caps error reporting at: 100 events per minute x 5 instances = 500 events per minute 20 trace details per minute x 5 instances = 100 trace details per minute App running on one host with ten instances. New Relic caps error reporting at: 100 events per minute x 10 instances = 1000 events per minute 20 trace details per minute x 10 instances = 200 events per minute Charting error rates and counts The Error rate chart is driven by a query on metric timeslice data, which is an unsampled aggregate data type that is accurate but has very limited dimensionality. This data can't be faceted or filtered as flexibly as error event data. You can reproduce this chart in a dashboard, or explore the metric timeslice data further by clicking the ... menu on the Error rate chart, and then using the View query or Add to dashboard options. To chart faceted error counts using event data, as in the Top 5 errors chart, use an NRQL event query. Click the ... menu on the Top 5 errors chart and choose View query for a starting point in creating your chart. Since event data can be sampled (see Caps on error reporting), you can use the EXTRAPOLATE keyword to get an accurate error count, even if sampling is occurring. Report custom errors You can report errors not collected by default with our agents using our agent APIs. For more, see the documentation on the API. Ignore errors You can prevent certain errors that would normally be reported to New Relic from being collected using our agent APIs or the server-side configuration UI. For more details, see Manage errors in APM. Reduce noise with expected errors Sometimes you want to collect error data, but not have those errors wake you up through alerts. Using the agent API, you can mark such errors as “expected”. They’ll still be visible in the Errors page, but won’t affect your service’s error rate or Apdex metrics. Disable error traces To prevent certain errors from being reported to New Relic, disable them in your agent's configuration file. For most agents, you can ignore certain error codes or disable errors completely. For more information, see your specific agent's configuration documentation: C SDK Go (not applicable; the agent only reports errors when configured to do so) Java .NET Node.js PHP Python Ruby Delete error traces Caution You cannot recover error traces after you delete them. Deleting errors is currently only available in the legacy Errors Classic UI. If you want to... Do this... Delete all error traces for your app If you have permissions to delete all error traces for an app: Go to one.newrelic.com > APM > (select an app) > More views > Errors (classic). Select Delete all errors. Delete all error traces for your account To delete all error traces for your New Relic account, get support at support.newrelic.com. Delete individual error traces To delete individual error traces, use APM's Errors (classic) page. Drill into an error from the table of errors, then click Delete this error. In addition to deleting error traces, you may also want to delete transaction traces or database/slow SQL traces. This will remove potentially sensitive data while retaining your other application data (such as Apdex, deployment information, etc.).",

      "body": "When DevOps experts need to track down what causes errors in your app, it may not be easy to identify the cause. APM's error profiles automatically compare one set of events to another. Each error profile provides visual details about significant differences in the frequency of different values for the events. For each attribute, the error profile includes: A pie chart showing how the error's attribute is distributed for values that deviate the most A table comparing the error attribute's distribution to that of non-erroring transactions This helps you take more of the guesswork out of resolving your app errors. You can more easily determine if you can safely ignore the error, or if you should attempt to resolve the error with a new deployment, code edits, customer communications, or other actions. Tip To view error profiles, you must use the classic APM view in New Relic One. To get a high-level overview of all your applications and services, use the New Relic Explorer in New Relic One. Error profile attribute examples Error profiles appear as a separate tab on your APM Errors page. Error profiles feature in APM Use error profiles to troubleshoot trends and significant differences in the frequency of error events for your app. An error profile is a collection of attributes with significantly different traits compared to non-errors. An attribute is \"unusual\" if a set of events represent what is normal (for example, errors compared to all traffic for a given time window), or differences between similar criteria (for example, two different hosts). Errors may be related to events such as: Specific web transaction names or non-web transaction names, JVM thread names, etc. Unique types of error messages, classes, etc. Random customer interactions; for example, a particular error comes from a single customer's account, while normal traffic comes from a wide variety of accounts External call counts or duration Timing differences among hosts in your ecosystem, cluster agent IDs, etc. Other anomalies Select error profile criteria Based on criteria in your app's Errors page, New Relic analyzes and lists unusual trends by their significance. Your selected criteria includes: Time window Errors page filters Search criteria on the Errors page or the Error profiles tab As you examine error profile results and want to dig deeper, add or change your app's error profile criteria. The Error profile tab refreshes to show the traits that distinguish the errors that match the updated criteria. Error profile criteria example Your app's Error profile tab currently shows several error classes or messages. To filter to a specific error class or message, use any of these options: From the Errors page's time picker, change the time range. For example, change the default (30 minutes) to Last 24 hours, ending now. From the Errors page's filter section: Select Back to groupings list, then select other Error groups, Error attributes, or Custom attributes. From the Errors page's filter section: Click a specific item on the list to narrow the filter. For example, if several error messages are listed, click only the message you are interested in. From the Error profiles tab's search box, type class, message, or other search values. Analyze error profile results To examine details for the attribute results in your app's error profile, you must use the classic APM view in New Relic One. Go to one.newrelic.com/apm > APM > (select an app) > Events > Errors, then toggle Show new view so that APM shows the classic view of the Errors page. From the Errors page, select the Error profile tab. From the Error profile tab, review the list of error attributes that match the currently selected error profile criteria. To view a specific attribute's details, click it. To highlight specific error details, mouse over any pie chart segment or table row for the attribute. To investigate a specific attribute for your app's errors, type its name in the Error profiles tab's search window, or change the currently selected error profile criteria. Compare values with large differences to identify the traits that distinguish the errors for an attribute. The comparative data in the error profile results and the error trace details can help you decide what steps to take for additional troubleshooting and resolving the error. Error and non-error distribution Depending on an error's attributes, sometimes the attribute is distributed differently for errors than for non-errors. Top deviating values New Relic analyzes each attribute for your app's errors and compares the distribution for errors that match your criteria to transactions without errors. If the proportions between these errors are roughly the same compared to transactions without any errors, the attribute does not contain much useful information for debugging. New Relic limits the error profile's pie chart and table for each attribute to show only the top deviating values. When proportions are roughly the same, New Relic does not include them in the error profile. Other category After the top deviating values, the error profile groups the rest into an Other category. This helps you focus on the values that are different for these errors. No value category If values are unusually present or are not present in the errors, you may see a No value category on the list of error profiles. Filters If you do not have any filters selected, the profile shows any distinguishing traits your errors exhibit in aggregate. Example: A certain kind of transaction makes up 20% of all of your traffic and is responsible for 80% of your errors. The error profile will show the unexpected proportions in the Transaction attribute. Adjust your error profile criteria to drill down even deeper into the profile results, so you can more effectively troubleshoot and resolve specific error events.",

Examine events leading up to error The Event log shows the browser interactions, AJAX calls, and traces that led up to an error. Decode your minified JavaScript If your JavaScript is minified, the errors on the JS errors page may not be very useful. To decode minified JavaScript and make these error stack traces more useful, you can upload JavaScript source maps to New Relic. one.newrelic.com > Browser > (select an app) > JS errors: Use this page to group and filter errors, explore stack trace details, and examine trends. (If your UI page looks different, you may be using an older, deprecated UI.) Query and visualize JS data New Relic saves JS errors as event data. This allows you to query your error data in the query builder. To run NRQL queries and create dashboards to view or share, query the JavaScriptError event type in the query builder. Use API to monitor handled errors To notice or log your app's handled errors or other miscellaneous errors, use the browser API's noticeError call. Review event logs Important SPA monitoring must be enabled. The event log shows the browser interactions, AJAX calls, and traces that led up to a JS error. This can help you troubleshoot the root cause of errors. one.newrelic.com > Browser > (select an app) > JS errors > (select an error) > Error instances: With SPA monitoring enabled, the event log shows you the activity leading up to an error. To view the Event log (if available): Go to one.newrelic.com > Browser > (select an app) > JS errors > (select an error) > Error instances. The event log will not be visible if there are no events in the event log. For example, if a JS error is occurring after an AJAX request that provides an error message, it could be that your AJAX request doesn't contain the right information. This results in a JS error due to a failed AJAX call. Troubleshoot missing event logs Some reasons for events in the event log not being present: Agent version. To capture event log data your site must have SPA monitoring enabled (browser agent version 1071 or higher). JS error not part of a browser interaction. If the JS error occurs outside of an interaction, the related browser interaction details cannot be captured (for example: if an async JS file experiences an error). A click triggered the JS error. In some cases if the error is a direct result of a click, no associated interactions are captured. Without event logs or stack traces, you can use the error detail charts to analyze the impact the error has by browser type, device type, and URI. View stack traces Stack traces can show you if an error is breaking important functionality, or if it's a less important error. To view an error's stack trace (if available): go to one.newrelic.com > Browser > (select an app) > JS errors > (select an error) > Error instances. Troubleshoot missing stack traces Some reasons why you may not see a stack trace for an error: If errors are not thrown, they will not produce a stack trace. The JS script is hosted on a CDN or another external location, and New Relic can't see the errors originating from those scripts. This can be solved in some cases by using cross-origin resource sharing (CORS). It is an AngularJS error. For more on this, see Missing Angular errors. The error is a SyntaxError or Script error: These occur while the script is loading, so they do not produce a stack trace. Some older browsers may generate errors without a stack trace, or may provide a stack trace that is not usable. You've captured the error before the New Relic agent sees it. If the error occurs during multiple harvest cycles in the same user visit, only error events reported during the first harvest cycle will have a stack trace recorded. Some solutions for reporting stack traces: Use the noticeError API call. Enable development mode. Use the JS errors UI page to get more information, including the event log. The JS errors page is designed to give you actionable information even without a stack trace. Global and generic errors New Relic wraps JavaScript functions to get information about thrown errors via the stack trace. If errors aren't thrown, they won't be available. For example, if you have an AngularJS application, follow the troubleshooting procedures when AngularJS errors do not appear in the UI. For some older browsers, the following errors may be unavailable: SyntaxError or Script error: These occur while the script is loading, so they do not produce a stack trace. In-line JavaScript or event handler errors: These are unwrapped. Errors thrown from third-party scripts that reside on another domain are not available. Errors occurring on older browsers: These may not be able to provide a usable stack trace. In some cases, they may not provide a stack trace at all. Error collection is done by wrapping JavaScript functions, so errors thrown by the browser at a lower level (such as cross-origin resource sharing errors) also are not available.",

      "body": "Browser uses a JavaScript snippet, also referred to as an \"agent,\" to instrument your app's webpages. The JavaScript collects data for browser monitoring. To install the browser agent, you can choose from a number of deployment options. If you don't have one already, create a New Relic account. It's free, forever. Enable browser monitoring Browser Pro+SPA is the default agent when you enable browser monitoring. This automatically gives you access to all of our browser monitoring features. For more information about the browser monitoring options, see Browser agent types in this document. To enable browser monitoring: Go to one.newrelic.com, select Browser, and then select Add more data. Follow the instructions in the UI to add browser monitoring to your app. Generate some traffic for your app, then wait a few minutes for data to appear in New Relic. Optional: After installation is complete and you are seeing data, go to the App settings page for additional agent configuration, or to change the browser agent type. It may take several minutes after enabling the browser monitoring agent before your webpage data appear in New Relic. If have problems, follow our troubleshooting tips. Deployment options No matter which option you use to deploy browser monitoring, the end result is the same: the browser monitoring JavaScript snippet (also referred to as the \"agent\") is inserted into your app pages. The method you select depends on your preferences and business needs. Enable an APM-monitored app When enabling browser monitoring, you can use an APM agent to automatically inject the browser monitoring JavaScript snippet for you. This is the easiest way to install the agent for an app that's already being monitored by APM. APM-monitored apps are listed on your APM Applications index. Enable with copy/paste When enabling browser monitoring, you can manually insert the JavaScript snippet into your app's webpages. The copy/paste option gives you control over the exact placement of our JavaScript snippet, which is required to monitor the webpage's performance. This is useful for: Standalone apps, static sites, and cached pages delivered by CDN APM apps that are not as closely coupled to the browser app as with a standard server-side app (for example, when your client-side app talks to a REST API back end) Some tips for using the JavaScript snippet: Placement in your webpage: Copy the code snippet, then paste it inline into your pages as close to the top of the <head> element as possible, but after any position-sensitive <meta> tags (for example, X-UA-Compatible or charset information). For more information on the inline head placement, see JavaScript placement requirements. License key and app ID: Near the bottom of the generated JavaScript is your browser license key and application ID. This is useful with the REST API and API Explorer. Instrument webpages using the APM agent This information applies to apps that are also monitored by APM. Our APM agents can instrument webpages with the required JavaScript for page load timing. If you are using an APM agent's API to manually add the JavaScript snippet to your webpages, insert the instrumentation snippet as close to the top as possible. This allows you to take advantage of detailed information about browser's AJAX calls and JavaScript errors. For more information, see the instructions for your APM agent: C SDK Go Java .NET Node.js PHP Python Ruby Use REST API This information applies to apps that are also monitored by APM. The REST API lets you manage deployment outside the browser monitoring UI. This is useful for large organizations deploying multiple apps. Browser agent types: Lite, Pro, Pro+SPA We have three types of browser agents: Lite, Pro, and Pro+SPA. The agent type has no impact on your billing. Browser agent type Comparison Pro+SPA This is the default installed agent when you enable browser monitoring. What it includes: Gives you access to all of the Browser Pro features and to Single Page App (SPA) monitoring. Provides detailed page timing data and the most up-to-date New Relic features, including distributed tracing, for all types of applications. Pro+SPA is not limited only to single page applications. After install, you can downgrade anytime to the less advanced agents if you don't want or need SPA monitoring. Pro What it includes: Gives you access to the Browser Pro features. What it doesn't include: Lacks the functionality designed for single page app monitoring. Lite What it includes: Gives you information about some basic page load timing and browser user information. What it doesn't include: Lacks the Browser Pro features and SPA features. Details about how agent types relate to pricing: New Relic One pricing: This pricing plan has data ingest as a billing factor. If you want to reduce data ingest, you may want to consider downgrading to lesser agent types after install. Original pricing: Your access to browser monitoring features is gated by your subscription plan, not by the agent type. This means there is no reason not to use the default Pro+SPA agent. After initial agent installation is finished, you can go to the App settings page to edit your configuration or to change your subscription.",

      "body": "Browser monitoring includes strict security measures to provide a robust, standalone product with browser monitoring features. Before you install the browser agent, make sure your system meets these requirements. Want to try out our browser monitoring? Create a New Relic account for free! No credit card required. Basic requirements To report data to browser, your application must at a minimum meet two basic requirements: The traffic to the application must be from clients able to load and execute browser JavaScript code and set cookies. Clients accessing the application must be able to send data to New Relic through HTTP requests. HTTPS is required for browser Pro features. Important Browsers that subscribe to a disconnect list or that use content filtering extensions such as AdBlock may not be able to send data to New Relic. For example, if you are using the Enhanced Tracking Prevention disconnect list for Mozilla Firefox 69.0 or higher, you will need to change the default configuration. Most typical browser applications meet these requirements. However, browser applications in restricted environments may have difficulty reporting data to New Relic; for example: Hybrid mobile applications Applications installed on unusual hardware, such as point-of-sale terminals or consumer appliances For more information, review the instrumentation for browser monitoring documentation, and verify end-user network access. Browser types Instrumentation is compatible with every browser type, including Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox, Microsoft Internet Explorer and Edge, and Apple Safari. The user interface is compatible with New Relic's supported browser versions. Exceptions Comments Paint timings The firstPaint and firstContentfulPaint attributes in BrowserInteraction, PageView, and PageViewTiming events are only compatible with: Chrome 60 or higher for desktop and mobile (Android webview and Chrome for Android) Opera 47 or higher for desktop Opera 44 or higher for Android mobile Samsung Internet for mobile AJAX AJAX timing features are not available with: Chrome for iPhone and iPad IE 7 and 8 PageAction events PageAction events require a browser that fully supports cross-domain XMLHttpRequests. Internet Explorer versions 9 and lower cannot record PageAction events. Learn more on querying your data. Session traces Session traces are reported only from browsers that support the Resource Timing Specification. SHA-256 New Relic can only monitor browsers that are compatible with SHA-256. APM agents You can deploy the browser agent for apps monitored by APM, or you can deploy the browser agent for your standalone apps. For more information, see the installation procedures. If you are deploying browser for an app using APM, make sure your agent supports browser monitoring: C SDK: Version 1.0.0 or higher Go: Version 2.5.0 or higher Java: Version 3.4.0 or higher .NET: Version 2.20.25.0 or higher Node.js: Version 1.4.0 or higher PHP: Version 4.4.5.35 or higher Python: Version 2.10.1.9 or higher Ruby: Version 3.7.0.177 or higher Supported frameworks The browser agent collects data on all front-end frameworks. However, the monitoring occurs on lower-level \"primitives\" that JavaScript frameworks use, so the level of detail collected by the instrumentation may vary depending on your specific framework. Exceptions Comments Zone.js If you're using AngularJS and you want to use our SPA monitoring features, note that Zone.js versions 0.6.18 to 0.6.24 are not compatible with browser. In all cases, the browser agent must be loaded before Zone.js to avoid errors. Cypress.io Browser is unable to properly instrument the open and send methods of requests when tests are run in Cypress. This will cause the following error to be thrown: Cannot set property 'status' of undefined Copy This will only affect customers running tests with the Browser agent present in their code. Production applications should not be affected. html2pdf.js This library is not compatible with our Pro+SPA agent due to the way this library wraps promises. If you're using this library, we recommend selecting the Pro agent type. Content Security Policy (CSP) considerations In order to obtain accurate browser performance metrics, browser requires the use of a small, inline JavaScript snippet. New Relic carefully reviews the inline JavaScript to prevent Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) and other potential vulnerabilities. Content Security Policy Level 2 adds restrictions to the types of JavaScript allowed, such as inline scripts. It also limits which domains can load scripts during page load. Important If your website does not allow any third-party hosted JavaScript to run, you must request a CSP exception via your organization’s standard procedures in order to install the browser monitoring agent. When requesting a CSP exception, follow your organization's standard procedures to contact your web or security team. The browser JavaScript agent requires the following CSP exceptions in order to run properly. Alternatively, you can add all of these exceptions to the fallback default-src directive (instead of script-src and connect-src). CSP exception Comments unsafe-inline Add to the script-src directive or to the fallback default-src directive. This is required because the agent is installed by including an inline script. https://js-agent.newrelic.com Add to the script-src directive or to the fallback default-src directive. This is where additional script files that the agent requires are hosted. https://bam.nr-data.net https://bam-cell.nr-data.net Important Add https://gov-bam.nr-data.net if you're using FedRAMP-compliant endpoints. Add to the script-src directive or to the fallback default-src directive. This is where the agent sends its collected data. One of the calls to this URL is a JSONP call, which means that the URL must be allowed as a script source. Add to the connect-src directive or to the fallback default-src directive. The connect-src directive affects the URLs that scripts can call (for example, using the XMLHttpRequest interface).

      "body": "Browser monitoring's PageViewTiming event sends each data point as a separate event as soon as it is available. Because we do not restrict the timing, you can receive first paint or first interaction data regardless of when it fires. This document describes why and how to use PageViewTiming and its attributes to query data about your site, component loading, and user performance metrics, both from visual and responsiveness standpoints. Why use PageViewTiming? If your application uses asynchronous or dynamic pages, you may need additional details about site or component loading. But pages can load content in many different ways, and users control when they interact with that content. This is why some user-centric performance metrics happen outside the standard window onload (page load time) in the browser agent. For example, users may become impatient and begin clicking as soon as content is on the webpage. Or, they may wait to use the page until long after content is loaded. The PageViewTiming event provides a more real-time delivery mechanism that does not have a dependency on any other event. The additional metrics can help you understand how users experience your site, both from visual and responsiveness standpoints. Support for Google's Core Web Vitals As of agent version 1177 for browser monitoring, we have full support for Google's Core Web Vitals for 2020. The metrics that make up Core Web Vitals will evolve over time. The current set for 2020 focuses on three aspects of the user experience: loading, interactivity, and visual stability. This includes the following metrics and their respective thresholds: Core Web Vitals metrics include loading, interactivity, and visual stability. Largest Contentful Paint (LCP): measures loading performance. To provide a good user experience, LCP should occur within 2.5 seconds of when the page first starts loading. First Input Delay (FID): measures interactivity. To provide a good user experience, pages should have a FID of less than 100 milliseconds. Cumulative Layout Shift (CLS): measures visual stability. To provide a good user experience, pages should maintain a CLS of less than 0.1. For each of these metrics, to ensure you're hitting the recommended target for most of your users, a good threshold to measure is the 75th percentile of page loads, segmented across mobile and desktop devices. To learn more, watch our Nerd Days talk on perceived performance. Detailed visual, interactivity, and responsiveness metrics The BrowserInteraction and PageView events end their reporting when they receive the page window load (or window load and AJAX) timing. However, paint and interactivity metrics can happen at any time. PageViewTiming delivers these metrics as a separate event to: Account for the variability in this timing. Avoid setting an arbitrary timeout. Prevent holding BrowserInteraction and PageView events indefinitely. Additional data Comments firstPaint and firstContentfulPaint The firstPaint and firstContentfulPaint attributes already are available with BrowserInteraction and PageView events. However, they are not always reliably captured before the window onload event fires. Using PageViewTiming gives you a way to capture these metrics even if they happen after the original page load time. This gives you a better understanding of the correlation between responsiveness of that load event and the visual rendering of your content. largestContentfulPaint The largestContentfulPaint,metric is available with agent version 1163 or higher. It reports the render time of the largest content element visible in the viewport. Google's research found that looking at when the largest element was rendered was a more accurate way to measure when the main content of a page is loaded and useful. For more information about this metric, including limitations and considerations, see the w3c draft. We also report the cumulative layout shift (CLS) score attribute with LCP. This attribute is reported as cumulativeLayoutShift. Largest Contentful Paint is one of three metrics identified by Google as the Core Web Vitals. LCP values up to 2.5 secs are considered \"Good,\" between 2.5-4.0 secs are considered \"Needs Improvement,\" and above 4.0 secs are considered \"Poor.\" firstInteraction and firstInputDelay With the addition of firstInteraction and firstInputDelay, you can quickly determine the ways that your users are interacting with that visual content. These metrics tell you not only when they interacted, but what type of interaction (mousedown, pointerdown, etc.) and how long it took for them to receive a response from your site. The firstInputDelay metric lies in the middle of FirstContentfulPaint and Time to Interactive (TTI) metrics. It measures the time between when a first input can be made and when the browser's main thread is able to respond to any interactions. We also report the cumulative layout shift (CLS) score attribute at the moment of the user's first interaction. This attribute is reported as cumulativeLayoutShift. First Input Delay is one of three metrics identified by Google as the Core Web Vitals. FID values up to 100 ms are considered \"Good,\" between 100-300 ms are considered \"Needs Improvement,\" and above 300 ms are considered \"Poor.\" For a more detailed explanation, see our browser monitoring release notes. cumulativeLayoutShift Cumulative Layout Shift (CLS) is available with agent v1177 or higher. CLS is an important, user-centric metric for measuring visual stability because it helps quantify how often users experience unexpected layout shifts. A low CLS helps ensure that the page is delightful. This is one of three metrics identified by Google as the Core Web Vitals. Cumulative Layout Shift is one of three metrics identified by Google as the Core Web Vitals. CLS scores up to 0.1 are considered \"Good,\" between 0.1-0.25 are considered \"Needs Improvement,\" and above 0.25 are considered \"Poor.\" timingName You can review different types of activities with the timingName attribute, such as firstPaint, firstContentfulPaint, firstInteraction, largestContentfulPaint, pageHide and windowUnload. For example, a PageViewTiming event may have a timingName of firstPaint and a firstPaint value of .03. The event will also include all default attributes included with the standard BrowserInteraction and PageView events. elementId This is the Id, if specified, of the largestContentfulPaint element. This value will only be reported with the LCP metric. This value can be null. elementSize This is the reported size of the largestContentfulPaint element. This value will only be reported with the LCP metric. pageHide The pageHide event, available with agent v1177 or higher, is sent when the browser hides the current page in the process of presenting a different page from the session's history. For example, when the user clicks the browser's Back button, the current page receives a pageHide event before the previous page is shown. For supporting documentation and browser compatibility for the pageHide event, see the MDN Web Docs site. We also report the cumulative layout shift (CLS) score attribute with pageHide. This attribute is reported as cumulativeLayoutShift. windowLoad The windowLoad event is available with agent v1177 or higher. This is fired when the whole page has loaded, including all dependent resources such as stylesheets and images. For supporting documentation and browser compatibility for the windowLoad event, see the MDN Web Docs site. We also report the cumulative layout shift (CLS) score attribute with windowLoad. This attribute is reported as cumulativeLayoutShift. windowUnload The windowUnload event is available with agent v1163 or higher. This is fired when a document or child resource is being unloaded. For supporting documentation and browser compatibility for the windowUnload event, see the MDN Web Docs site. We also report the cumulative layout shift (CLS) score attribute with windowUnload. This attribute is reported as cumulativeLayoutShift. Compatibility and requirements Requirements: Meets install requirements. Reporting of this event requires browser agent version 1153 or higher and a Pro or Pro+SPA agent. Follow our Browser agent release notes to find out when new metrics are released. These metrics are supported by the following browser versions. For unsupported browsers, no PageViewTiming events will be recorded. Metrics Supported browser versions cumulativeLayoutShift Chrome 79 Metric is elevated to stable; changes in metric definition will be reported in this log. Chrome 77 Metric exposed via API: Cumulative Layout Shift available via Layout Instability API firstPaint firstContentfulPaint Chrome 60 or higher for desktop and mobile (Android webview and Chrome for Android) Opera 47 or higher for desktop Opera 44 or higher for Android mobile Samsung Internet for mobile largestContentfulPaint Chrome 77 or higher for desktop and mobile firstInteraction firstInputDelay These metrics require the addEventListener browser API. This API is available in all modern browsers, including: Apple Safari Google Chrome Microsoft Internet Explorer (IE) versions 9 or higher Mozilla Firefox pageHide This metric is currently supported by all browsers on desktop and mobile.

Compatibility matrix via MDN documentation. windowUnload This metric is currently supported by all browsers on desktop and mobile. Compatibility matrix via MDN documentation. CumulativeLayoutShift Cumulative Layout Shift (CLS) is a metric measuring the stability of the content on a webpage. For a complete description, see web.dev/cls. How is CLS captured in New Relic Shifts in page layout as reported by the Layout Instability API are aggregated throughout the life of the page and reported as an attribute on all PageViewTiming events, representing the CLS value when that event occurred. Using this model, users can look at their CLS value at different points in the page's life; for example, CLS values up until the first-time users interact with the page or hide the page. Approximating other CLS sources Lighthouse captures CLS value only up to the time when a page is loaded, which is useful in a development or lab environment. You can approximate Lighthouse values by looking at the windowLoad PageViewTiming event. CrUX report uses values captured over the lifespan of the page, which is useful to analyze worst-case shifts in a RUM environment. You can approximate CrUX values by looking at the CLS attribute on the windowUnload PageViewTiming event. These values will not be exactly the same because of different sample sets and a difference in how values from long-lived web pages are included. The New Relic browser monitoring agent captures CLS when the page unloads, while CrUX collects and updates the metric throughout the lifespan of the page. How CLS is aggregated As of July 2021, Google has updated the way CLS values are aggregated. Browser monitoring agent versions v12xx use the method described in Evolving the CLS metric. Browser monitoring agent v12xx or higher: Layout shift values are captured in windows. Layout shifts that occurred within 1 second of each other, but no more than 5 seconds between the first and last shift, are part of the same window. A CLS score represents the sum of layout shift values from the window with the highest sum of layout shift values. Prior to Browser agent v12xx: A CLS score represents the sum of all layout shifts that occurred up until that point in the page's life. Query your event data Here are some sample queries for the event data to help you get started.

      "body": "Browser monitoring supports the uploading of source maps. Source maps support is primarily useful for \"decoding\" minified JavaScript. Minified JavaScript results in mostly useless error stack traces on browser's JS errors page. Uploading source maps converts these errors to understandable stack traces, with useful references to code lines. This feature might also be useful for bundled or transpiled JavaScript code. Browser gives you two options for using source maps: Upload source maps via the browser UI Publish source maps to browser via the API This document will explain the first method: how to upload source maps via the UI, along with general troubleshooting help. For instructions on using the API method, see Push source maps via the API. Import source maps via the New Relic UI You can drag and drop, or upload, a source map file into the browser UI to associate it with a specific JavaScript file. New Relic will then convert minified stack traces into un-minified traces and source code visible on the JS errors page. To drag in or upload a source map to browser, the source map must be on your local machine. To associate a source map with an error stack trace on the JS errors page: Go to one.newrelic.com > Browser > (select an app) > JS Errors, then select a JS error group. (Don't select an Errors without a stack trace group.) From the selected JS error group, select the error instance details tab (next to the Summary tab). Error groupings will have one or more frames listed that reference JavaScript files. Select the + icon on the right side of a frame to expand it. Then drag the matching source map file into the frame. Alternative option: when the frame is expanded, select find file to upload the file manually. Tip An error frame with a gray strip on the left side indicate minified JS; a blue strip indicates it has had a source map applied. Other JS error frame features include: If you want to... Do this... See more of the surrounding code Select Show 10 more lines above/below to view the code before or after the code in the stack trace. See original, minified file information For individual frame info: Next to the frame's source line and column, mouse over the ellipsis. For raw data of the entire stack trace: At the top of the error tab, select < /> Raw. Remove a source map From an expanded stack trace frame, select Remove file. Troubleshooting Stack traces are still minified If you have uploaded source maps to New Relic and still see minified stack traces, there are a few things to check. Using the API is the best way to investigate potential issues, by listing or deleting published source maps. Typical problems Troubleshooting tips URL mismatch Each frame in the stack trace is associated with a specific JavaScript URL. That URL must match the JavaScript URL that was used when publishing the source map. Ensure that these URLs match exactly. Release name/ID mismatch If the JavaScript URL is not versioned when you deploy your front end assets, a release name and release ID must be specified using the newrelic.addRelease API method, and also when publishing your source maps. Ensure that these strings match exactly. 409 error: Combination of javascriptUrl, releaseName, and releaseId must be unique If a source map file for a particular JavaScript URL is uploaded without a release name or ID specified, New Relic treats the URL as a unique identifier. To resolve this, delete the source map that has NULL release name and ID values and re-upload all versions for that URL including those parameters. This will allow multiple versions of source maps for a particular JS URL. Missing SourcesContent component Your mapping file must contain the SourcesContent component for New Relic to un-minify your stack traces. If you have uploaded your map successfully and are still not seeing un-minified code, check the original source map for this component. If you can't find it, regenerate the source map so the component is included, and upload your map to New Relic. If the SourcesContent component is not added, an error similar to Whoops, that was the wrong file. Please try again. will appear. Can't generate source maps Having trouble even generating source maps? Every build system has its own instructions for generating source maps. For more specific details, please see the documentation for your particular tool. Below are source map generation instructions for two popular build systems: Generate source maps with UglifyJS Generate source maps using UglifyJS: When \"uglifying\" source files, specify a source map file name and include the original source content: Starting on version v3.12.5: uglifyjs [source files] \\ -o bundle.min.js \\ -c -m --source-map \"includeSources=true\" Copy For older versions: uglifyjs [source files] \\ -o bundle.min.js \\ --source-map bundle.min.js.map \\ --source-map-include-sources \\ -c -m Copy Generate source maps with webpack Generate source maps using Webpack: In your production webpack config, simply specify source-map for the config.devtool property. The sourceMapFilename property of config.output is optional and defaults to [name].js.map. devtool: 'source-map', output: { path: path.join(__dirname, 'dist'), filename: '[name].js', sourceMapFilename: '[name].js.map', }, Copy",

      "body": "By default, mobile monitoring enables crash reporting for your mobile applications to help track and diagnose crashes. When an Android application crashes, the agent uploads a crash report to the New Relic collector. The crash details will then be processed and de-obfuscated automatically if you are using ProGuard or DexGuard. You can view detailed information about crashes in the Crash analysis UI, or receive crash notifications by email. You can also explore the crash data deeper with New Relic Insights, or integrate with ticketing systems for further investigation. Upload the ProGuard or DexGuard file The Android agent supports ProGuard and DexGuard. DexGuard is an extension to ProGuard, and it behaves the same as ProGuard when dealing with crash symbolication and obfuscated code maps. ProGuard obfuscates your code by renaming classes, fields, and methods with semantically obscure labels. DexGuard adds another additional layer of obfuscation and security, but otherwise behaves identically to ProGuard. If ProGuard or DexGuard is enabled, the stack trace produced by a crash consists only of these obfuscated labels, which are not human-readable. Follow the SDK installation or upgrade instructions to configure ProGuard or DexGuard and enable crash reporting. Be sure to create the newrelic.properties file containing your application token. Use mapping.txt file The agent uses the mapping.txt file produced during a ProGuard/DexGuard-enabled build. This file consists of the obfuscated label names, and provides reverse mapping between obfuscated and plain text labels. You must use the copy of mapping.txt generated during the build that produced your final application. The application's build ID changes each time an APK is generated, and the build ID in the mapping file must match the ID contained in each uploaded crash report. After you create a newrelic.properties file containing your New Relic app token in your project, the ProGuard or DexGuard mapping.txt file will be uploaded automatically after each build. Exception If either of the following situations occur, you must manually upload the mapping.txt replacement file: If the mapping.txt file is renamed using the DexGuard -printmapping option, the Android agent will be unable to locate or upload the stripped names. If you see obfuscated crash reports in the Crashes page, you may not have a mapping.txt file uploaded. Map Processing Important Agent version 5.27.0 introduces changes to the way the agent plugin process maps during builds. Maps are reported for select variant builds The agent will tag and report only those mapping.txt files generated by Release build-type variants. This behavior can be configured or disabled through the New Relic Gradle Plugin extension. Variants are assigned unique build IDs During an execution of a Gradle build, a single unique ID (build ID) was generated to represent all variants of the app built during that invocation. This often led to mismatched crash reports for customers using variants to customize a common app code base. Each variant is now identified by its own unique ID, which is used when reporting the variant's ProGuard map to New Relic. You can disable this behavior through the New Relic Gradle Plugin extension. Compress maps prior to upload As apps get larger, so do their associated maps, which then results in longer upload times when reporting the map. If map reporting time is unreasonably long, the agent can compress the map prior to transfer. To enable compressed map uploads, add the following to your app's newrelic.properties file: com.newrelic.compressed_uploads=true Copy Deferred crash reporting Important Agent version 6.0.0 introduces changes to the way the agent plugin processes crashes at runtime. In an attempt to address crash report duplication, deferred crash reporting is now the default crash reporting behavior. In this case, crash reports are recorded when they occur, but they're not uploaded until the next application launch. The previous crash reporting behavior is still available: uploading the crash as soon as it occurs before the application process terminates. You can use the NewRelic.withCrashReportingEnabled(boolean) API method. For example: NewRelic .withApplicationToken(\"<appToken>\") .withCrashReportingEnabled(true) .start(this.getApplication()); Copy Disable crash reporting If you want to use another crash reporting tool, you can disable crash reporting by calling NewRelic.disableFeature(FeatureFlag.CrashReporting) prior to agent initialization. For example: NewRelic.disableFeature(FeatureFlag.CrashReporting); NewRelic .withApplicationToken(\"<appToken>\") .start(this.getApplication()); Copy Debug the crash reporter Crash reporting for Android is designed to work with other crash reporting frameworks by chaining the uncaught exception handler if it is already registered. If no other framework has been found (or if New Relic is the first framework registered), the debug logs will include: Installing New Relic crash handler. Copy If another handler is already registered, debug logs will include: Installing New Relic crash handler and chaining previous exception handler. Copy Every time New Relic catches an exception, it is logged to DEBUG level. For example: A crash has been detected in <className>. Copy If New Relic catches an exception but crash reporting has been disabled for any reason, this message is logged: A crash has been detected but crash reporting is disabled. Copy If you don't see crash reports, check the debug logs for messages like this. Manually upload a ProGuard or DexGuard map file In some unusual circumstances, it may not be possible to automatically upload the ProGuard or DexGuard mapping file. This is often due to incorrectly creating a newrelic.properties file containing your application token. This will result in build errors or warnings with detailed log messages. To manually upload a ProGuard or DexGuard map file: Find the mapping.txt file(s) in the project's build directory For example, the file is located in the <PROJECT_ROOT>/app/build/outputs/mapping/<BUILD_VARIANT> directory for projects that use Android Studio. Generally, a release variant is used when building the final version of the application. The following command is useful for finding map files: find <project_root> -name mapping.txt Copy Using a command terminal, upload the ProGuard or DexGuard mapping file: For a US account: curl -v -F upload=@\"<mapping.txt>\" -H \"X-APP-LICENSE-KEY:<APPLICATION_TOKEN>\" https://mobile-symbol-upload.newrelic.com/symbol Copy For a EU account: curl -v -F upload=@\"<mapping.txt>\" -H \"X-APP-LICENSE-KEY:<APPLICATION_TOKEN>\" https://mobile-symbol-upload.eu.newrelic.com/symbol Copy Replace the following in your command: <mapping.txt> is the full path to the ProGuard or DexGuard mapping.txt file. <APPLICATION_TOKEN> is your mobile monitoring application token.",

      "body": "A condition describes a monitored data source and the behavior of that data source that will be considered a violation. This document will explain the types of conditions available, how to create a condition, and how to view existing conditions. Related documentation: Basic concepts and workflow Min/max limits (like maximum number of conditions per policy) REST API to list or edit alert settings NRQL Condition NerdGraph API to manage your NRQL conditions via NerdGraph. Create a condition To create a condition: Create a policy and you will automatically be prompted to add a condition. OR From an existing policy page, select Create/add a condition. Follow the prompts in the UI, which include: Selecting a product/data-source Selecting a condition type Defining thresholds Optional: After you finish creating a condition, copy it and add it to other policies. Important Conditions that provide fields for you to input numerical values accept decimal points up to the second decimal place (hundredths). For example, 0.01 is the smallest possible value. Types of conditions Here are descriptions of the different types of conditions: NRQL query conditions Use the UI or NerdGraph API to create NRQL conditions for basic NRQL queries that return a number. APM metric alert conditions See APM metric alert conditions for tips about creating APM conditions using NRQL. Baseline conditions Baseline alerting allows you to create conditions that dynamically adjust to changing data and trends, such as weekly or seasonal patterns. This feature is available for APM and browser monitoring apps, as well as NRQL queries. Outlier detection conditions Outlier detection attempts to find groupings in your data and then looks for values that are outliers from those groupings. Outlier detection is available only for NRQL alerts. Synthetic monitoring multi-location conditions With multi-location Synthetic monitoring conditions, you can set up a monitor to notify you when a specific number of locations are failing at the same time. Key transaction metrics conditions For APM, you can set up conditions for key transactions. Java instance conditions You can set thresholds that open a violation when they are breached by any of your Java app's instance metrics. By scoping thresholds to specific instances, you can more quickly identify where potential problems are originating. This is useful, for example, to detect anomalies that are occurring only in a subset of your app's instances. These sorts of anomalies are easy to miss for apps that aggregate metrics across a large number of instances. JVM health metric conditions (Java apps) For Java apps monitored by APM, you can set thresholds that open a violation when the heap size or number of threads for a single JVM is out of the expected operating range. We calculate alerting threshold violations individually for each of the app's selected instances. When creating your condition, select JVM health metric as the type of condition for your Java app's alert policy, then select any of the available thresholds: Deadlocked threads Heap memory usage CPU utilization time Garbage collection CPU time Violations will automatically close when the inverse of the threshold is met, but by using the UI you can also change the time when a violation force-closes for a JVM health metric. Default is 24 hours. Web transaction percentile conditions We include the option to define a percentile as the threshold for your condition when your web app's response time is above, below, or equal to this value. This is useful, for example, when Operations personnel want to alert on a percentile for an app server's overall web transaction response time rather than the average web response time. Tip If you want to set an arbitrary threshold in a condition for a non-web app transaction, use the NRQL queries feature. To define the percentile threshold: Select Web transactions percentiles as the type of condition for your APM app's condition, then select a single app. (To alert on more than one app, create an individual Web transactions percentiles condition for each.) To define the thresholds that open the violation, type the Percentile nth response time value, then select its frequency (above, below, or equal to this value). We store the transaction time in milliseconds, although the user interface shows the Critical and Warning values as seconds. If you want to define milliseconds, be sure to include the decimal point in your value. Dynamic targeting with labels for apps By applying labels to applications, you can automatically link these entities to your condition. This makes it easy to manage all the applications within a dynamic environment. We recommend using the agent configuration file to best maintain entity labels. A single label identifies all entities associated with that label (maximum 10,000 entities). Multiple labels only identify entities which share all the selected labels. Using dynamic targeting with your condition also requires that you set a violation close timer. To add, edit, or remove up to ten labels for a condition: Select APM > Application metric as the product type. When identifying entities, select the Labels tab. Search for a label by name, or select a label from the list of categories. You can also create conditions directly within the context of what you are monitoring with Infrastructure. Infrastructure conditions You can create conditions for your resources directly in Infrastructure. For example, if you want to be notified when we have stopped receiving data from an Infrastructure agent, use the host not reporting condition type. This allows you to dynamically alert on filtered groups of hosts and configure the time window from 5 to 60 minutes. Apdex and response time conditions You can open violations and send notifications for response times. However, Apdex scores are almost always more meaningful and provide a better reflection of application performance. For example, average response times can be skewed by outliers, while the Apdex score gives a more accurate assessment of acceptable response time rates that your users experience. Change a condition name If you want to change the default condition name, make it short and descriptive. Provide useful information for notification messages that have limited characters, such as email subject lines, online chat, etc. Use camel case or dotted decimal notation. Describe the essence of what is being violated. To change an existing condition's name: In the one.newrelic.com top nav, click Alerts & AI, click Alert policies, then (select a policy). Click a condition name to edit it, and then type a meaningful name for the condition. You can't edit the product and condition type associated with a condition. Instead, you must delete the condition and create a new one with a different product and condition type. Maintain policies and conditions After you save the condition, the currently selected policy lists all alert conditions that apply to it. From here you can: Repeat the steps to add more conditions to the policy. Continue the policy setup process by adding one or more notification channels to it. Change the condition's name, the entities it's scoped to, or the critical (red) and warning (yellow) thresholds. Copy the condition and add it other policies in the selected account. Rename the policy. Disable any conditions in the policy, or delete the policy or any of its conditions. You may also manage your policies via the policies NerdGraph API. View existing conditions The policies index lists them in alphabetical order. To view or search for existing conditions: In the one.newrelic.com top nav, click Alerts & AI, then click Alert policies. Use the search box, sort any column, or scroll the list, then select a policy's name to see its conditions. To view policy and condition information for a specific entity: From that entity's product UI, select Settings, then click Alert conditions.",

      "body": "Our Python agent lets you change the default agent behavior agent using configuration options. The only required Python agent configuration setting is the license key. The license key identifies the account where the agent reports application data. Depending on how you are hosting your application, the license key can be provided via a configuration file or an environment variable. Configuration methods and precedence The primary way to configure the Python agent is via the configuration file, which is generated as part of the standard install process. It is also possible to set a limited number of configuration options using server-side configuration in the UI or by using environment variables. You can also specify some settings on a per-request basis by passing settings with the WSGI request environ dictionary. The Python agent follows this order of precedence for configuration: With the Python agent, per-request options override server-side config. If enabled, server-side config overrides all corresponding values in the agent config file, even if the server-side values are left blank. The agent config file overrides environment variables. Environment variables override the agent defaults. Here are detailed descriptions of each configuration method: Agent configuration file Typically you configure your Python agent from a local configuration file on the agent's host system. Supply the path to the config file at startup using one of these methods: When you call newrelic.agent.initialize(), provide the path to the config file as the first argument. OR Set the NEW_RELIC_CONFIG_FILE environment variable. If you use the newrelic-admin wrapper script, you must use the environment variable because the wrapper script calls the agent automatically. The configuration file uses a structure similar to Microsoft Windows .ini files. For more information, see the Python ConfigParser module's file format documentation. Tip A sample configuration file is included with the Python agent as newrelic/newrelic.ini. You can also generate one from the newrelic-admin script using the generate-config command, or download a copy from our download repo. Server-side configuration Server-side configuration allows you to configure certain settings in the New Relic One UI. This applies your changes automatically to all agents even if they run across multiple hosts. Where available, this document includes the UI labels for server-side config under individual config options as the Server-side label. Important If server-side config is enabled, the agent ignores any value in the config file that could be set in the UI. Even if the UI value is empty, the agent treats this as an empty string and does not use the agent config file. Environment variables Environment variables allow you to override the defaults for certain core settings. If the equivalent setting is explicitly listed in the agent config file, the config file settings take precedence over the environment variable. Where available, environment variables are documented below under individual config options as the Environ variable. For simple configurations, you can use the environment variables in conjunction with server-side configuration and avoid the agent config file altogether. This is the default setup with Heroku, where installing the New Relic add-on automatically populates the necessary environment variables. Environment variable Configuration setting NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY license_key NEW_RELIC_APP_NAME app_name NEW_RELIC_MONITOR_MODE monitor_mode NEW_RELIC_DEVELOPER_MODE developer_mode NEW_RELIC_LOG log_file NEW_RELIC_LOG_LEVEL log_level NEW_RELIC_HIGH_SECURITY high_security NEW_RELIC_PROXY_SCHEME proxy_scheme NEW_RELIC_PROXY_HOST proxy_host NEW_RELIC_PROXY_PORT proxy_port NEW_RELIC_PROXY_USER proxy_user NEW_RELIC_PROXY_PASS proxy_pass NEW_RELIC_AUDIT_LOG audit_log_file NEW_RELIC_STARTUP_TIMEOUT startup_timeout NEW_RELIC_SHUTDOWN_TIMEOUT shutdown_timeout NEW_RELIC_LABELS labels NEW_RELIC_PROCESS_HOST_DISPLAY_NAME process_host.display_name NEW_RELIC_API_KEY api_key NEW_RELIC_CA_BUNDLE_PATH ca_bundle_path NEW_RELIC_DISTRIBUTED_TRACING_ENABLED distributed_tracing.enabled NEW_RELIC_ANALYTICS_EVENTS_MAX_SAMPLES_STORED event_harvest_config.harvest_limits.analytic_event_data NEW_RELIC_CUSTOM_INSIGHTS_EVENTS_MAX_SAMPLES_STORED event_harvest_config.harvest_limits.custom_event_data NEW_RELIC_SPAN_EVENTS_MAX_SAMPLES_STORED event_harvest_config.harvest_limits.span_event_data NEW_RELIC_ERROR_COLLECTOR_MAX_EVENT_SAMPLES_STORED event_harvest_config.harvest_limits.error_event_data NEW_RELIC_FEATURE_FLAG feature_flag Per-request configuration For certain WSGI servers, you can override the app name and capture attributes settings on a per-request basis. This is possible with WSGI servers where you can define additional key/value pairs that are passed into the per-request WSGI environ dictionary. Set these values with the strings on, off, true, false, 1 and 0. If set from a configuration mechanism implemented using Python code, Python objects evaluating to True or False will also be accepted. Example: Apache/mod_wsgi app name In the Apache/mod_wsgi server, you can use the SetEnv directive to override config settings (optionally inside a Location or Directory block). For example, you could override the app name for a complete virtual host, or for a subset of URLs handled by the WSGI application for that virtual host. In addition to being able to override certain agent configuration settings, you can set other per-request configuration settings with their WSGI environment key: newrelic.set_background_task If set to true, this web transaction will instead be reported as a non-web transaction. newrelic.ignore_transaction If set to true, this web transaction will not be reported. newrelic.suppress_apdex_metric If set to true, no Apdex metric will be generated for this web transaction. newrelic.suppress_transaction_trace If set to true, this web transaction cannot be recorded in a transaction trace. newrelic.disable_browser_autorum If set to true, this disables automatic insertion of the JavaScript header/footer for page load timing (sometimes referred to as real user monitoring or RUM). Only applicable if auto-insertion is available for your web framework. Important Using a WSGI middleware to set these values will not work where the Python agent's own WSGI application wrapper was applied at an outer scope. In these cases you must make calls to the agent API to achieve the same outcome. Multiple environment configuration The agent reads its primary configuration from an agent config section called newrelic. You can provide overrides for specific deployment environments (for example, Development, Staging, Production) in additional sections. Preface these sections with [newrelic:environment], where environment is replaced with the name of your environment. To specify that the agent should use an environment-based configuration, use one of these methods: When you call newrelic.agent.initialize(), provide the environment name as the second argument. OR Set the NEW_RELIC_ENVIRONMENT environment variable to the environment name. If no environment is specified, the agent will use the default settings as specified in the newrelic agent config section. The basic structure of the configuration file is: [newrelic] ... default settings [newrelic:development] ... override settings [newrelic:staging] ... override settings [newrelic:production] ... override settings Copy General configuration settings These settings are available in the agent configuration file. license_key (REQUIRED) Type String Default (none) Set in Config file, environment variable Environ variable NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY Specifies the license key of your New Relic account. This key associates your app's metrics with your New Relic account. app_name (HIGHLY RECOMMENDED) Type String Default Python Application Set in Per-request option, config file, environment variable Per-request option newrelic.app_name Environ variable NEW_RELIC_APP_NAME The application name used to aggregate data in the New Relic One UI. To report data to multiple apps at the same time, specify a list of names separated with a semicolon ;. Do not put a space before the semicolon, which causes the Python config parser to interpret the name as an embedded comment. monitor_mode Type Boolean Default true Set in Config file, environment variable Environ variable NEW_RELIC_MONITOR_MODE When true, the agent collects performance data about your app and reports this data to our data collector. developer_mode Type Boolean Default false Set in Config file, environment variable Environ variable NEW_RELIC_DEVELOPER_MODE When true, the agent will instrument your web app, but will not send any actual data. In this offline mode, you will not be billed for an active agent. Use developer mode to test new versions of the agent, or test the agent against third-party packages in a developer environment. Offline mode is not a way of running the APM locally, because the metrics the agent collects are not reported anywhere. log_file Type String Default (none) Set in Config file, environment variable Environ variable NEW_RELIC_LOG Sets the name of a log file, which is useful for debugging issues with the agent. This is not set by default, since the agent does not know your web app process's parent user or what directories that process has permission to write to. For detailed information, see Python agent logging. Whatever you set this to, ensure the permissions for the containing directory and the file itself are correct, and that the user that your web application runs as can write to the file. Tip Use an absolute path unless you are sure what the working directory of your application will be at startup. If you can't write out a log file, you can also use stderr and output to standard error output. This would normally result in output appearing in your web server log. log_level Type String Default info Set in Config file, environment variable Environ variable NEW_RELIC_LOG_LEVEL Sets the level of detail of log messages, if you've set the log file location. This log_level will not affect the Python logging module log level. Possible values, in increasing order of detail, are critical, error, warning, info, and debug. To report agent issues, the most useful setting is debug. However, debug generates a lot of information very quickly, so do not keep the agent at this level for longer than it takes to reproduce your problem. high_security Type Boolean Default false Set in Config file, environment variable Environ variable NEW_RELIC_HIGH_SECURITY High security mode enforces certain security settings and prevents them from being overridden, so that no sensitive data is sent to us. Enabling high security mode means that request parameters are not collected, and you cannot send raw SQL. To activate high security mode, set it to true in the local .ini configuration file and activate it in the Account Settings in the UI. For more information, see High security. proxy_scheme, proxy_host, proxy_port, proxy_user, proxy_pass Type Strings Default (none) Set in Config file, environment variable Environ variables NEW_RELIC_PROXY_SCHEME NEW_RELIC_PROXY_HOST NEW_RELIC_PROXY_PORT NEW_RELIC_PROXY_USER NEW_RELIC_PROXY_PASS By default, the Python agent attempts to directly connect to our servers. If there is a firewall between your host and the our collector that requires you to use an HTTP proxy, set proxy_host and proxy_port to the required values for your HTTP proxy. If proxy authentication is implemented by the HTTP proxy, also set proxy_user and proxy_pass. The proxy_scheme setting dictates what protocol scheme is used to talk to the HTTP proxy. When set to http, the agent uses a SSL tunnel through the HTTP proxy for end-to-end encryption. Instead of setting the proxy_scheme, proxy_host and proxy_port settings, you can also set the proxy_host setting to a valid URI for the proxy. Include the scheme, host, and port; for example, http://proxy-host:8000. This also works if you set the details of the HTTP proxy with the NEW_RELIC_PROXY_HOST environment variable. Tip Python agent versions 2.0.0 or earlier do not provide the proxy_scheme setting, and the protocol scheme defaults to http or https depending whether ssl is disabled or enabled. If you are upgrading from an older agent version and your config file doesn't include proxy_scheme, ensure you add the setting and set it appropriately. If you don't, the agent will continue to base the protocol scheme on the ssl setting for backwards compatibility. As proxies are usually only configured to accept proxy requests via the http protocol scheme, not setting proxy_scheme may result in a failure. audit_log_file Type String Default (none) Set in Config file, environment variable Environ variable NEW_RELIC_AUDIT_LOG Sets the name of the audit log file. If set, the agent logs details of messages passed back and forth between the monitored process and the collector. This allows you to evaluate the security of the Python agent. Use an absolute path unless you are sure what your app's working directory will be at startup. Whatever you set this to, ensure the permissions for the containing directory and the file itself are correct. Also ensure your web app's parent user can write to the file. Caution Do not use audit logging on an ongoing basis, especially in a production environment. Because the agent does not truncate or rotate the log file, the log file can grow very quickly. labels (tags) Type String Default (none) Set in Config file, environment variable Environ variable NEW_RELIC_LABELS Adds tags. Specify name:value separated by a colon :, and separate additional tags with semicolons ;. Two tags Server:One;Data Center:Primary Copy process_host.display_name Type String Default (none) Set in Config file, environment variable Environ variable NEW_RELIC_PROCESS_HOST_DISPLAY_NAME Sets the hostname to be displayed in the APM UI. If set, this overrides the default hostname that the agent captures automatically. api_key Type String Default (none) Set in Config file, environment variable Environ variable NEW_RELIC_API_KEY Sets the api_key to be used with newrelic-admin record-deploy. ca_bundle_path Type String Default (none) Set in Config file, environment variable Environ variable NEW_RELIC_CA_BUNDLE_PATH Manual override for the path to your local CA bundle. This CA bundle will be used to validate the SSL certificate presented by our data collection service. Tip This configuration option is only available in Python agent versions 4.2.0 and newer. apdex_t Type Float Default 0.5 Set in Config file, environment variable Environ variable NEW_RELIC_APDEX_T We'll record transaction traces when they exceed this threshold. The format is a number of seconds (decimal points allowed). See our glossary entry for apdex_t Attributes Attributes are key-value pairs that provide information for transaction traces, traced errors, browser monitoring, and transaction events. In addition to configuring attributes for all four destinations with the general attribute settings below, they can also be configured on a per-destination basis. For more information, see Python agent attributes, Enabling and disabling attributes, and Attribute examples. attributes.enabled Type Boolean Default true Set in Config file This setting can be used to turn on or off all attributes. attributes.include Type List of Strings Default (none) Set in Config file If attributes are enabled, attribute keys found in this list will be sent to us. Keys in the list should be space-separated as shown below: key1 key2 key3 Copy Rules for attributes can be found on the agent attributes page. attributes.exclude Type List of Strings Default (none) Set in Config file All attribute keys found in this list will not be sent to us. Keys in the list should be space-separated as shown below: key1 key2 key3 Copy Rules for attributes can be found on the agent attributes page. Transaction tracer configuration Important Do not use brackets [suffix] at the end of your transaction name. The agent automatically strips brackets from the name. Instead, use parentheses (suffix) or other symbols if needed. For more information about transaction traces, see Transaction traces. transaction_tracer.enabled Type Boolean Default true Set in Server-side config, config file Server-side label Enable transaction tracing? If enabled, the transaction tracer captures deep information about slow transactions. transaction_tracer.transaction_threshold Type Positive float or string (apdex_f) Default apdex_f Set in Server-side config, config file Server-side label Threshold Threshold in seconds for when to collect a transaction trace. When the response time of a controller action exceeds this threshold, the agent records a transaction trace. Valid values are any positive float, or apdex_f (four times apdex_t). transaction_tracer.record_sql Type String Default obfuscated Set in Server-side config, config file Server-side label Record SQL? When the transaction tracer is enabled, the agent can record SQL statements. The recorder has three modes: off (sends no SQL), raw (sends the SQL statement in its original form), and obfuscated (strips out numeric and string literals). Most web frameworks (including Django) parameterize SQL queries so they do not actually contain the values used to fill out the query. If you use raw mode with one of these frameworks, the Python agent will only see the SQL prior to insertion of values. The parametrized SQL will look much like obfuscated mode. transaction_tracer.stack_trace_threshold Type Float Default 0.5 Set in Server-side config, config file Server-side label Stack trace threshold Threshold in seconds for when to collect stack traces from SQL calls. When SQL statements exceed this threshold, the agent captures the current stack trace. This is helpful for pinpointing where long SQL calls originate in an application. transaction_tracer.explain_enabled Type Boolean Default true Set in Server-side config, config file Server-side label Enable SQL query plans? Determines whether the Python agent will capture query plans for slow SQL queries. Only supported in MySQL and PostgreSQL. transaction_tracer.explain_threshold Type Float Default 0.5 Set in Server-side config, config file Server-side label Query plan threshold Queries in transaction traces that exceed this threshold will report slow query data and any available explain plans. Explain plan collection will not happen if transaction_tracer.explain_enabled is false. transaction_tracer.attributes.enabled Type Boolean Default true Set in Config file This setting can be used to turn on or off all attributes for transaction traces. If attributes.enabled at the root level is false, no attributes will be sent to transaction traces regardless on how this configuration setting (transaction_tracer.attributes.enabled) is set. transaction_tracer.attributes.include Type List of strings Default (none) Set in Config file If attributes are enabled for transaction traces, all attribute keys found in this list will be sent to us in transaction traces. For more information, see the agent attribute rules. transaction_tracer.attributes.exclude Type List of Strings Default (none) Set in Config file All attribute keys found in this list will not be sent in transaction traces. For more information, see the agent attribute rules. transaction_tracer.function_trace Type String Default (none) Set in Config file For the specified functions or methods, the agent will capture additional function timing instrumentation. Specify these names in the form module:function or module:class.function. Important Wildcarding (globbing) for function and class names is possible using patterns supported by the fnmatch module. Module paths are not supported by wildcards. Specify the patterns in the form module:func* or module:class.*. Requires Python agent version 6.4.4.161 or higher. Transaction segment configuration Here are Transaction segment settings available via the agent configuration file. transaction_segments.attributes.enabled Type Boolean Default true Set in Config file This setting can be used to turn on or off all attributes for segments of transaction traces. If attributes.enabled at the root level is false, no attributes will be sent to segments of transaction traces regardless on how this configuration setting (transaction_segments.attributes.enabled) is set. transaction_segments.attributes.include Type List of strings Default (none) Set in Config file If attributes are enabled for segments of transaction traces, all attribute keys found in this list will be sent in segments of transaction traces. For more information, see the agent attribute rules. transaction_segments.attributes.exclude Type List of Strings Default (none) Set in Config file All attribute keys found in this list will not be sent in segments of transaction traces. For more information, see the agent attribute rules. Error collector configuration Here are error collector settings available via the agent configuration file. Tip For an overview of error configuration in APM, see Manage errors in APM. error_collector.enabled Type Boolean Default true Set in Server-side config, config file Server-side label Enable error collection? If enabled, the error collector captures information about uncaught exceptions. error_collector.ignore_classes Type String Default (none) Set in Server-side config, config file Server-side label Ignore these errors To stop collecting specific errors, set this to a space-separated list of the Python exception type names to ignore. Use the form module:class for the exception name. Tip Before version 6.4.0 of the agent, this setting was named error_collector.ignore_errors. If your configuration file still uses ignore_errors, update your agent to use ignore_classes. error_collector.ignore_status_codes Type String Default 100-102 200-208 226 300-308 404 Set in Server-side config, config file Server-side label Ignore these status codes Lists HTTP status codes which the agent should ignore rather than record as errors. List additional status codes as integers separated by spaces, and specify ranges with a hyphen - separator between the start and end values. To add one of the default codes to your allow list, preface the code with an exclamation point !. This setting is only compatible with some web frameworks, as some frameworks do not use exceptions to return HTTP responses. Tip This configuration option can only be set in server-side configuration in Python agent versions 6.4.0 and newer. error_collector.expected_classes Type String Default (none) Set in Server-side config, config file Server-side label Expect these error class names Prevents specified exception classes from affecting error rate or Apdex score while still reporting the errors to APM. Set this to a space-separated list of the Python exception type names to be expected. Use the form module:class for the exception name. Tip This configuration option is only available in Python agent versions 6.4.0 and newer. error_collector.expected_status_codes Type String Default (none) Set in Server-side config, config file Server-side label Expect these status codes Prevents specified HTTP status codes from affecting error rate or Apdex score while still reporting the errors to APM. List status codes as integers separated by spaces and specify ranges with a hyphen - separator between the start and end values. To negate one of the codes in your list, preface the code with an exclamation point !. This setting is only compatible with some web frameworks, as some frameworks do not use exceptions to return HTTP responses. Tip This configuration option is only available in Python Agent versions 6.4.0 and newer. error_collector.attributes.enabled Type Boolean Default true Set in Config file This setting can be used to turn on or off all attributes for traced errors. If attributes.enabled is false at the root level, then no attributes will be sent to traced errors regardless on how this configuration setting (error_collector.attributes.enabled) is set. error_collector.attributes.include Type List of strings Default (none) Set in Config file If attributes are enabled for traced errors, all attribute keys found in this list will be sent to in traced errors. For more information, see the agent attribute rules. error_collector.attributes.exclude Type List of strings Default (none) Set in Config file Attribute keys found in this list will not be sent to in traced errors. For more information, see the agent attribute rules. error_collector.capture_events Type Boolean Default true Set in Config file If enabled, the error collector captures event data for advanced analytics. For more information, see APM Errors. Browser monitoring settings Here are browser monitoring settings available via the agent configuration file. browser_monitoring.enabled Type Boolean Default true Set in Config file Enables browser monitoring. For more information, see Page load timing in Python. Important Before enabling browser monitoring in the config file, enable it in the application settings in the browser monitoring UI. browser_monitoring.auto_instrument Type Boolean Default true Set in Config file For supported Python web frameworks, this setting enables auto-insertion of the browser monitoring JavaScript fragments. browser_monitoring.content_type Type String Default text/html Set in Config file Specify the HTML Content-Type(s) that our browser monitoring agent should auto-instrument. Add additional entries in a space-separated list. Instrument xhtml+xml page responses If you are generating HTML page responses and using the Content-Type of application/xhtml+xml, you can override the allowed content types to list both this content type and the default text/html by using: browser_monitoring.content_type = text/html application/xhtml+xml Copy Important The browser monitoring JavaScript snippet prevents the page from validating as application/xhtml+xml, although the page should load and render in end-user browsers. browser_monitoring.attributes.enabled Type Boolean Default false Set in Config file This setting can be used to turn on or off all attributes for browser monitoring. This is the data which gets sent to page view events. If attributes.enabled is false at the root level, no attributes will be sent up in browser monitoring regardless on how the configuration setting (browser_monitoring.attributes.enabled) is set. browser_monitoring.attributes.include Type List of Strings Default (none) Set in Config file If attributes are enabled for browser_monitoring, all attribute keys found in this list will be sent in page views. For more information, see the agent attribute rules. browser_monitoring.attributes.exclude Type List of Strings Default (none) Set in Config file All attribute keys found in this list will not be sent in page views. For more information, see the agent attribute rules. Transaction events settings Here are Transaction events settings available via the agent configuration file. Tip These configuration settings used to be called analytic_events. If your configuration file still uses analytic_events, update your agent to use transaction_events. transaction_events.enabled Type Boolean Default true Set in Config file Transaction event data allows the use of additional information such as histograms and percentiles. transaction_events.attributes.enabled Type Boolean Default true Set in Config file This setting can be used to turn on or off all attributes for transaction events. If attributes.enabled is false at the root level, then no attributes will be sent to transaction events regardless on how this configuration setting (transaction_events.attributes.enabled) is set. transaction_events.attributes.include Type List of Strings Default (none) Set in Config file If attributes are enabled for transaction events, all attribute keys found in this list will be sent in transaction events. For more information, see the agent attribute rules. transaction_events.attributes.exclude Type List of Strings Default (none) All attribute keys found in this list will not be sent to in transaction events. Note that excluding attributes from transaction events does not exclude from span events. For more information, see the agent attribute rules. Custom events settings Here are custom events settings available via the agent configuration file. custom_insights_events.enabled Type Boolean Default true Set in Config file Allow recording of events to the Insights custom events API via record_custom_event(). Datastore tracer settings These datastore tracer settings are available via the agent configuration file: datastore_tracer.instance_reporting.enabled Type Boolean Default true Set in Config file When enabled, the agent collects datastore instance metrics (such as host and port) for some database drivers. These are also reported on slow query traces and transaction traces. datastore_tracer.database_name_reporting.enabled Type Boolean Default true Set in Config file When enabled, the agent collects database name for some database drivers. The database name is reported on slow query traces and transaction traces. Distributed tracing settings Important Starting in Python agent version 7.0.0.166 or higher, distributed tracing is enabled by default. Enabling distributed tracing disables cross application tracing and has other effects on APM features. If migrating from cross application tracing, read the transition guide. Distributed tracing lets you see the path that a request takes as it travels through a distributed system. Settings include: distributed_tracing.enabled Type Boolean Default true Set in Config file, environment variable Environ variable NEW_RELIC_DISTRIBUTED_TRACING_ENABLED Enables Distributed Tracing Span event configuration Span events are collected for distributed tracing. Distributed tracing must be enabled to report span events. Configuration options include: span_events.enabled Type Boolean Default true Set in Config file This setting can be used to turn on or off whether the Python agent sends spans. span_events.attributes.enabled Type Boolean Default true Set in Config file This setting can be used to turn on or off for all attributes for span events. If attributes.enabled at the root level is false, no attributes will be sent to span events regardless on how this configuration setting (span_events.attributes.enabled) is set. For more information, see the agent attribute rules. span_events.attributes.include Type List of strings Default (none) Set in Config file If attributes are enabled for span events, all attribute keys found in this list will be sent in span events. For more information, see the agent attribute rules. span_events.attributes.exclude Type List of Strings Default (none) Set in Config file All attribute keys found in this list will not be sent in span events. For more information, see the agent attribute rules. Event harvest configuration Event harvest settings limit the amount of event type data sent to New Relic. When you use these settings, consider these important points: Event harvest settings affect the limits for a single instance of the agent, and not across the entire application. See the usage example below for how to set limits across an entire application. Real time streaming sends data every five seconds (12 times per minute), but the event harvest settings still affect the rate in events per minute. Enabling or disabling real time streaming does not require changing these settings. With real time streaming (enabled by default), New Relic will display the event harvest limits for entities in five second intervals. This means, for example, when you set a limit value of 1200 in the config file, you'll see it as 100 in New Relic. Usage example Let's say an application is deployed across 10 hosts, each running four processes per host. To limit the number of span events to 10,000 events per minute for the entire application, divide that number by 10 hosts. Then divide again by four processes per host. 10000 / (10 * 4) = 250 Based on that calculation, the final setting is: event_harvest_config.harvest_limits.span_event_data = 250 Event harvest configuration settings include: event_harvest_config.harvest_limits.analytic_event_data Type Integer Default 1200 Set in Config file Environ variable NEW_RELIC_ANALYTICS_EVENTS_MAX_SAMPLES_STORED Limit for analytic events per minute sent by an instance of the Python agent to New Relic. event_harvest_config.harvest_limits.custom_event_data Type Integer Default 1200 Set in Config file Environ variable NEW_RELIC_CUSTOM_INSIGHTS_EVENTS_MAX_SAMPLES_STORED Limit for custom events per minute sent by an instance of the Python agent to New Relic. Custom events are created through the Python Telemetry SDK. event_harvest_config.harvest_limits.span_event_data Type Integer Default 1000 Set in Config file Environ variable NEW_RELIC_SPAN_EVENTS_MAX_SAMPLES_STORED Limit for span events per minute sent by an instance of the Python agent to New Relic. event_harvest_config.harvest_limits.error_event_data Type Integer Default 100 Set in Config file Environ variable NEW_RELIC_ERROR_COLLECTOR_MAX_EVENT_SAMPLES_STORED Limit for error events per minute sent by an instance of the Python agent to New Relic. Event loop visibility settings Important Requires Python agent version 5.0.0.124 or higher. Event loop visibility surfaces information about transactions that block the event loop. The agent will generate information about transactions that have waited a significant amount of time to acquire control of the event loop. Settings include: event_loop_visibility.enabled Type Boolean Default true Set in Config file Set this to false to disable event loop information. event_loop_visibility.blocking_threshold Type Float Default 0.1 Set in Config file Threshold in seconds for how long a transaction must block the event loop before generating event loop information. Garbage collection runtime metrics settings Important Requires Python agent version 6.2.0.156 or higher. These garbage collection runtime metrics settings are available via the agent configuration file: gc_runtime_metrics.enabled Type Boolean Default false Set in Config file When enabled, the agent will generate and send garbage collection metrics. gc_runtime_metrics.top_object_count_limit Type Integer Default 5 Set in Config file The agent reports object count metrics for the most common object types being collected by the garbage collector. For each object type, this setting allows you to set the maximum number of individual metrics that will be sampled. Other configuration settings Here are assorted other settings available via the agent configuration file. utilization.detect_aws Type Boolean Default true If true, the agent automatically detects that it is running in an AWS environment. utilization.detect_azure Type Boolean Default true If true, the agent automatically detects that it is running in an Azure environment. utilization.detect_gcp Type Boolean Default true If true, the agent automatically detects that it is running in a Google Cloud Platform environment. utilization.detect_pcf Type Boolean Default true If true, the agent automatically detects that it is running in a Pivotal Cloud Foundry environment. utilization.detect_docker Type Boolean Default true If true, the agent automatically detects that it is running in Docker. slow_sql.enabled Type Boolean Default true Set in Server-side config, config file Server-side label Enable Slow SQL? If enabled, the agent captures details from long-running SQL database queries. thread_profiler.enabled Type Boolean Default true Set in Server-side config, config file Server-side label Enable thread profiler? Enables you to schedule thread profiling sessions. The thread profiler will periodically capture a snapshot of the call stack for each active thread in the application to construct a statistically representative call tree. cross_application_tracer.enabled Type Boolean Default false Set in Config file Enables cross application tracing, which connect your apps and services within your service-oriented architecture. strip_exception_messages.enabled Type Boolean Default false Set in Config file If enabled, exception messages will be stripped from error traces before they are sent to the collector, in order to prevent the inadvertent capture of sensitive information. This option is automatically enabled in high security mode. strip_exception_messages.whitelist Type String Default (none) Set in Config file Exceptions listed in your allow list will not have their messages stripped, even if strip_exception_messages.enabled is true. The allow list is a space-separated string of exception types, each in the form of module:exception_name. List built-in exceptions as exception_name; you do not need to prepend module: to them. Example: Built-in exception and user-defined exception KeyError my_module:MyException Copy startup_timeout Type Float Default 0.0 Set in Config file, environment variable Environ variable NEW_RELIC_STARTUP_TIMEOUT By default, the agent starts when it receives the first transaction (either web or non-web). The agent then starts in parallel, ensuring that this initial request is not delayed. However, the agent does not record the details of this initial request because the agent cannot collect data until registration is complete. To override this, you can set a startup timeout in seconds. The agent will then pause the initial transaction and wait for registration to complete. Important Since startup_timeout delays your app start, we recommend only setting a startup timeout for background task queuing systems, not web applications. shutdown_timeout Type Float Default 2.5 Set in Config file, environment variable Environ variable NEW_RELIC_SHUTDOWN_TIMEOUT On process shutdown, the agent attempts one final upload to the collector. To prevent the agent running indefinitely in case of an issue, the process shuts down normally if the shutdown_timeout threshold is reached. This shutdown can result in data loss, but the agent prioritizes key metric data during the upload process. For background task queuing systems, especially those which run a small number of tasks per process, you may want to increase the shutdown timeout to ensure the agent can upload all data on process shutdown. Tip The agent defaults to a 2.5 second timeout because Apache and many other web servers have a 3.0 second process termination timeout. The agent exits at 2.5 seconds to allow atexit cleanup code registered for the process to run. compressed_content_encoding Type String Default gzip Set in Config file If the data compression threshold is reached in the payload, the agent compresses data, using gzip compression by default. The config option compression_content_encoding can be set to deflate to use deflate compression. Heroku heroku.use_dyno_names Type Boolean Default true Environ variable NEW_RELIC_HEROKU_USE_DYNO_NAMES If true, the agent uses Heroku dyno names as the hostname. heroku.dyno_name_prefixes_to_shorten Type Array Default [\"scheduler\", \"run\"] Environ variable NEW_RELIC_HEROKU_DYNO_NAME_PREFIXES_TO_SHORTEN Ordinarily the agent reports dyno names with a trailing dot and process ID (for example, worker.3). You can remove this trailing data by specifying the prefixes you want to report without trailing data (for example, worker). Built-in instrumentation The Python agent instruments a range of Python packages/modules. This instrumentation only occurs when the target Python package/module is imported by an application. To disable default instrumentation, provide a special import-hook section corresponding to the name of the module that triggered instrumentation. Then set the enabled setting to false to disable instrumentation of that module. Example: Disabling MySQLdb database query instrumentation Add the following to the configuration file: [import-hook:MySQLdb] enabled = false Copy",

      "body": "Follow the appropriate procedure to rename your browser app depending on the deployment option you used to add it to browser. Rename app monitored by APM If you added an app to browser already being monitored by APM, the app name that appears in browser is the same as the app name in the APM UI. To rename the app, use any of these options: Option Comments Rename and continue collecting data This option is useful when you simply want to give an app a different display name (alias). To change the alias that appears in the New Relic UI, use the app's Settings page: Go to one.newrelic.com > APM > (select an app) > Settings > Application. Stop reporting under the old name To stop reporting data under the old name and begin collecting data with a new name (app identifer), use the APM agent's configuration file. This changes the identifier that New Relic's data collector uses to distinguish one app from another. Based on the data retention schedule, New Relic will retain historical data collected under the old name, and will collect and aggregate data under the new name. If one or more apps share the same name, then their data will be aggregated in the UI. Caution If you change the app identifier, a new application will appear in our user interface with the new name, and data will stop reporting to the app(s) with the old name. Rename app via JavaScript snippet This information applies if you inserted the browser agent's JavaScript snippet into your: App monitored by APM that was deployed via the copy/paste method Single page app (SPA) Any standalone browser app that is not also monitored by APM You cannot directly edit the JavaScript snippet in the existing app. Instead, to use your app with a different name: Follow standard procedures to create a new app using the copy/paste method. Provide the new name, and generate the JavaScript snippet. Copy the new JavaScript snippet. In your webpage, replace the JavaScript from your original app with the JavaScript generated for the new app name. If your standalone app has multiple names, copy the custom app IDs in your configuration script to your new app. Based on the data retention schedule, New Relic will retain historical data collected under the old name, and will collect and aggregate data under the new name. Rename app via New Relic REST API (v2) This information applies only to browser apps that are also monitored by APM. You cannot change the app name via the REST API if you used the copy/paste method to insert browser's JavaScript snippet into your app. Follow standard procedures to change the APM app alias via REST API or API Explorer. New Relic automatically changes the display name for the app everywhere in the New Relic UI, including browser.",

DistributedTraceSummary MobileRequest MobileRequestError Span Transaction TransactionError InfrastructureEvent Data sources : InfrastructureCloudTrail InfrastructureEvent describes changes (deltas) that occur in a system's live state. When an inventory or system state is added, removed, or changed, Infrastructure will produce an InfrastructureEvent that logs that activity. Attribute name Definition Data types category A New Relic category used to organize events in the UI. For example: automation, notification, and service. InfrastructureEvent changeType A simple classification of the type of change made to the entity: added, modified, or removed. InfrastructureEvent changedPath The fully specified name of the item that changed. This is constructed by taking the source and adding one or more additional path elements that uniquely identify the item that changed. InfrastructureEvent deltaId Delta refers to a recorded change in the system. The deltaId is a number used by New Relic to organize incoming inventory change data. InfrastructureEvent eventId The unique ID of the event, generated by New Relic. InfrastructureEvent format The type of infrastructure event. Each format type includes attributes that may be used to render the event in the UI. InfrastructureEvent newStatus The new agent status: disconnected or connected. InfrastructureEvent newValue If a change is made to the entity, this attribute contains the new value of the inventory that was changed. This will have no value if no change has been made. The value will display approximately 4K bytes of data. InfrastructureEvent oldValue If a change is made to the entity, this attribute contains the old value of the inventory that was changed. This will be blank if no change has been made. InfrastructureEvent provider For integrations that use generic event types (like the DatastoreSample event), the provider value specifies the source of the data (the service, or a sub-category of data from that service). Some Insights events are generic and are used by several integrations. For example, the DatastoreSample event is used by several integrations, including the AWS DynamoDB integration and the AWS RDS integration. In these cases, the provider attribute value represents the source of that attribute. This will usually be the service that data comes from or, for integrations that use several provider values, a certain sub-category of data from that service. When a provider value is present for a generic event, that event will have additional integration-specific attributes attached to it. Here’s an example of an Insights NRQL query that returns the attributes present for a DatastoreSample event reported by the AWS RDS integration: SELECT * from DatastoreSample where provider = 'RdsDbCluster' InfrastructureEvent source The fully specified origin of this inventory item. This is typically in the form category/plugin, where plugin is the generic word used for the tool that gathered this data. InfrastructureEvent summary A summary of the change that happened. Uses a human-friendly string, such as Agent disconnected. InfrastructureEvent violationUpdateType The type of change to the violation: For example: open or closed.

PageViewTiming PageViewTiming sends each data point as a separate event as soon as it is available. This is useful for asynchronous, dynamic pages. To use this event, you must have browser agent version 1149 or higher. For more information, see the PageViewTiming query examples. PageAction PageAction event tracks data on each action performed on a page. Its attributes provide app and geographic data, as well as data about the user’s browser dimensions, session IDs, and referring and page URLs. BrowserInteraction (SPA) BrowserInteraction contains several PageView attributes as well as attributes that are specific to single-page apps (SPA) AjaxRequest An AjaxRequest event is created any time an Ajax call is made. When an Ajax call happens during a BrowserInteraction event, it is decorated with additional attributes related to the browser interaction. The event attributes track geographic and browser information. BrowserTiming (SPA) BrowserTiming is a custom event that captures SPA timing data for browser interactions started using the custom createTracer SPA API method. BrowserTiming contains many of the same attributes used by other events, especially AjaxRequest. JavaScriptError When a JavaScript error occurs, a JavaScriptError event is created.

      "body": "Follow the appropriate procedure to rename your browser app depending on the deployment option you used to add it to browser. Rename app monitored by APM If you added an app to browser already being monitored by APM, the app name that appears in browser is the same as the app name in the APM UI. To rename the app, use any of these options: Option Comments Rename and continue collecting data This option is useful when you simply want to give an app a different display name (alias). To change the alias that appears in the New Relic UI, use the app's Settings page: Go to one.newrelic.com > APM > (select an app) > Settings > Application. Stop reporting under the old name To stop reporting data under the old name and begin collecting data with a new name (app identifer), use the APM agent's configuration file. This changes the identifier that New Relic's data collector uses to distinguish one app from another. Based on the data retention schedule, New Relic will retain historical data collected under the old name, and will collect and aggregate data under the new name. If one or more apps share the same name, then their data will be aggregated in the UI. Caution If you change the app identifier, a new application will appear in our user interface with the new name, and data will stop reporting to the app(s) with the old name. Rename app via JavaScript snippet This information applies if you inserted the browser agent's JavaScript snippet into your: App monitored by APM that was deployed via the copy/paste method Single page app (SPA) Any standalone browser app that is not also monitored by APM You cannot directly edit the JavaScript snippet in the existing app. Instead, to use your app with a different name: Follow standard procedures to create a new app using the copy/paste method. Provide the new name, and generate the JavaScript snippet. Copy the new JavaScript snippet. In your webpage, replace the JavaScript from your original app with the JavaScript generated for the new app name. If your standalone app has multiple names, copy the custom app IDs in your configuration script to your new app. Based on the data retention schedule, New Relic will retain historical data collected under the old name, and will collect and aggregate data under the new name. Rename app via New Relic REST API (v2) This information applies only to browser apps that are also monitored by APM. You cannot change the app name via the REST API if you used the copy/paste method to insert browser's JavaScript snippet into your app. Follow standard procedures to change the APM app alias via REST API or API Explorer.

      "body": "Browser monitoring includes strict security measures to provide a robust, standalone product with browser monitoring features. Before you install the browser agent, make sure your system meets these requirements. Want to try out our browser monitoring? Create a New Relic account for free! No credit card required. Basic requirements To report data to browser, your application must at a minimum meet two basic requirements: The traffic to the application must be from clients able to load and execute browser JavaScript code and set cookies. Clients accessing the application must be able to send data to New Relic through HTTP requests. HTTPS is required for browser Pro features. Important Browsers that subscribe to a disconnect list or that use content filtering extensions such as AdBlock may not be able to send data to New Relic. For example, if you are using the Enhanced Tracking Prevention disconnect list for Mozilla Firefox 69.0 or higher, you will need to change the default configuration. Most typical browser applications meet these requirements. However, browser applications in restricted environments may have difficulty reporting data to New Relic; for example: Hybrid mobile applications Applications installed on unusual hardware, such as point-of-sale terminals or consumer appliances For more information, review the instrumentation for browser monitoring documentation, and verify end-user network access. Browser types Instrumentation is compatible with every browser type, including Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox, Microsoft Internet Explorer and Edge, and Apple Safari. The user interface is compatible with New Relic's supported browser versions. Exceptions Comments Paint timings The firstPaint and firstContentfulPaint attributes in BrowserInteraction, PageView, and PageViewTiming events are only compatible with: Chrome 60 or higher for desktop and mobile (Android webview and Chrome for Android) Opera 47 or higher for desktop Opera 44 or higher for Android mobile Samsung Internet for mobile AJAX AJAX timing features are not available with: Chrome for iPhone and iPad IE 7 and 8 PageAction events PageAction events require a browser that fully supports cross-domain XMLHttpRequests. Internet Explorer versions 9 and lower cannot record PageAction events. Learn more on querying your data. Session traces Session traces are reported only from browsers that support the Resource Timing Specification. SHA-256 New Relic can only monitor browsers that are compatible with SHA-256. APM agents You can deploy the browser agent for apps monitored by APM, or you can deploy the browser agent for your standalone apps. For more information, see the installation procedures. If you are deploying browser for an app using APM, make sure your agent supports browser monitoring: C SDK: Version 1.0.0 or higher Go: Version 2.5.0 or higher Java: Version 3.4.0 or higher .NET: Version 2.20.25.0 or higher Node.js: Version 1.4.0 or higher PHP: Version 4.4.5.35 or higher Python: Version 2.10.1.9 or higher Ruby: Version 3.7.0.177 or higher Supported frameworks The browser agent collects data on all front-end frameworks. However, the monitoring occurs on lower-level \"primitives\" that JavaScript frameworks use, so the level of detail collected by the instrumentation may vary depending on your specific framework. Exceptions Comments Zone.js If you're using AngularJS and you want to use our SPA monitoring features, note that Zone.js versions 0.6.18 to 0.6.24 are not compatible with browser. In all cases, the browser agent must be loaded before Zone.js to avoid errors. Cypress.io Browser is unable to properly instrument the open and send methods of requests when tests are run in Cypress. This will cause the following error to be thrown: Cannot set property 'status' of undefined Copy This will only affect customers running tests with the Browser agent present in their code. Production applications should not be affected. html2pdf.js This library is not compatible with our Pro+SPA agent due to the way this library wraps promises. If you're using this library, we recommend selecting the Pro agent type. Content Security Policy (CSP) considerations In order to obtain accurate browser performance metrics, browser requires the use of a small, inline JavaScript snippet. New Relic carefully reviews the inline JavaScript to prevent Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) and other potential vulnerabilities. Content Security Policy Level 2 adds restrictions to the types of JavaScript allowed, such as inline scripts. It also limits which domains can load scripts during page load. Important If your website does not allow any third-party hosted JavaScript to run, you must request a CSP exception via your organization’s standard procedures in order to install the browser monitoring agent. When requesting a CSP exception, follow your organization's standard procedures to contact your web or security team. The browser JavaScript agent requires the following CSP exceptions in order to run properly. Alternatively, you can add all of these exceptions to the fallback default-src directive (instead of script-src and connect-src). CSP exception Comments unsafe-inline Add to the script-src directive or to the fallback default-src directive. This is required because the agent is installed by including an inline script. https://js-agent.newrelic.com Add to the script-src directive or to the fallback default-src directive. This is where additional script files that the agent requires are hosted. https://bam.nr-data.net https://bam-cell.nr-data.net Important Add https://gov-bam.nr-data.net if you're using FedRAMP-compliant endpoints. Add to the script-src directive or to the fallback default-src directive. This is where the agent sends its collected data. One of the calls to this URL is a JSONP call, which means that the URL must be allowed as a script source. Add to the connect-src directive or to the fallback default-src directive. The connect-src directive affects the URLs that scripts can call (for example, using the XMLHttpRequest interface). If you have CSP restrictions specifically around this directive, then add this URL as an exception.",

      "body": "Your end-user experience depends on your entire technology stack. You need to quickly understand what's causing a customer complaint or issue. Did the problem come from your infrastructure, your application, or the browsers that ultimately render it? Is it the result of a problematic internet provider, a problem in your own data center with failing CPU or memory, or something else? More than Real User Monitoring (RUM) Many websites contain dynamic content that is loaded after the initial page has finished loading, and complex JavaScript code increases the need for error reporting. Browser monitoring in New Relic One provides a Real User Monitoring (RUM) solution that measures the speed and performance of your end users as they navigate to your site from different web browsers, devices, operating systems, and networks. With browser monitoring in New Relic One, you see actionable data about your end users' experience with your app. But browser monitoring in New Relic goes far beyond the initial page load to measure full page life cycle data. For example, our browser UI shows you: Actual performance data, such as by page view popularity and user satisfaction (Apdex) scores Perceived performance data that measures how quickly your async or dynamic visuals and interactive page contents display JavaScript error analytics, stack traces, and line-of-code visibility, to show you the end-user steps leading up to an error itself Session performance with a detailed timeline and heat map of the load and interaction events during a webpage's full life cycle AJAX requests indicating problems with timing, end points, and specific locations in the webpage Hash-based route changes in apps with single-page application (SPA) architectures These tools (and more!) help your teams optimize your end users' page load experience, eliminate bugs, and troubleshoot faster across your full stack. Examine user perceptions Real user data gives insights into actual page performance, but you also need to look into your users' perception of your site's performance. Pages can load content in many different ways, and users control when they interact with that content. This is why some user-centric performance metrics happen outside the standard window onload (page load time) in the browser monitoring agent. The PageViewTiming event provides a more real-time delivery mechanism that does not have a dependency on any other event. Additional metrics include: First paint, first contentful paint, and largest contentful paint First input delay First interaction This helps you understand how users experience your site, both from visual and responsiveness standpoints. Improve interactive app performance Our single-page app (SPA) monitoring automatically tracks route changes, initial page loads, and synchronous and asynchronous activity during browser interactions. You can also use our browser agent and SPA API to monitor virtually anything that executes inside the browser. If you are a developer, SPA monitoring can help you: Create faster, more responsive, highly interactive apps. Monitor the throughput and performance that real users are experiencing. Troubleshoot and resolve problems within the context of the page load. Query and visualize the data to assist with business decisions. Bring better apps to the marketplace more quickly. Correlate front-end and back-end problems With New Relic One, you can instrument any type of data you need, such as metrics, events, logs, and traces. This helps you find actionable data about your end users' experience across the stack. For example: Full-Stack Observability Comments Locations or domains Limit browser monitoring to focus on specific geographical locations or specific types of end-user activity. You can also monitor or block specific domains. Trends in interactions Use our comparative charting feature for a direct page load time comparison between real user (browser) interactions and trends appearing in Synthetic monitors. Distributed tracing Isolate latency from the web browser through back-end services with distributed tracing. The UI helps you see the connection across across a full transaction, from browser activity, to time spent in network, to back-end activity. Browser types Explore your end users' experience with your app segmented by any types of browsers they use, including: Top browsers by throughput Average page load time by platform type (mobile, desktop, and other) Selected browser type by version (for example, Chrome 31, 32, 33, etc.) This helps you quickly determine whether problems with page load timing may be related to a specific browser type or platform, or whether the problem is more widespread. Get started with browser monitoring Follow these basic steps, and you'll quickly be up and running in New Relic with browser monitoring! Review the compatibility details and basic requirements for browser monitoring. Install the browser agent. Go to [one.newrelic.com > Explorer > Browser applications. Use the Explorer to access all your entities, that is, anything we can identify that reports data, from applications and hosts to custom groupings of any elements. View summary data from your Browser summary page, then drill down into page load timing details and other UI data.

Use the Explorer to access all your entities, that is, anything we can identify that reports data, from applications and hosts to custom groupings of any elements. Alternatively, go to one.newrelic.com, click Browser, and select an app from the Browser index. From the app's Summary page, use standard New Relic page functions to drill down into detailed information. one.newrelic.com > Browser > (select an app) > Summary: After you select an application from the browser apps index, the Summary page shows a summary of browser performance for that app. The Summary page includes: Core Web Vitals widgets User time on the site Initial page load and route change chart User-centric page load times chart Throughput chart Front end vs. back end chart First interaction by device type, First interaction by user agent, JavaScript errors, and Longest first input delay by URL Related Entities widget View Synthetics monitors Core Web Vitals widgets The Core Web Vitals widgets show how your browser performs according to Google's Core Web Vitals. The Core Web Vitals widgets include: LCP - Largest Contentful Paint FID - First Input Delay CLS - Cumulative Layout Shift User time on the site The User time on the site widget shows the time a user remains on the site. Initial page load and route change chart The Initial page load and route change chart shows the load time of a traditional URL change stemming from a load or reload of a URL. This chart appears with more detail about the page load timing process on the page load time page. User-centric page load times chart The User-centric page load times chart shows the load time of a page for a user. This chart appears with more detail about the page load timing process on the page load time page. Throughput chart The Throughput chart displays browser throughput as pages per minute (ppm). The value in the upper right of the chart is the average value for the selected time range. If you have enabled SPA monitoring enabled and the Summary page shows the SPA load time chart, the Throughput chart will also use SPA data. Tip App server requests per minute (rpm) may show a different measurement than the browser page load timing's pages per minute (ppm). Front end vs. back end chart The Front end vs. back end chart links to the connect APM service application. For details on APM and tracing, see Language agents and distributed tracing. First interaction by device type, First interaction by user agent, JavaScript errors, and Longest first input delay by URL You'll also see summary versions of these metrics from the page load time page and JavaScript errors page: First interaction by device type First interaction by user agent JavaScript errors Longest first input delay by URL Related Entities widget The Related Entities widget shows all the entities that are related to the browser. To understand more about connections between entities, read about Entity relationships. View Synthetics monitors The button directs you to the Synthetics page.

If you have already added apps, the browser applications index automatically appears. The browser index page provides a list of your existing apps being monitored by browser. It is also the starting point to install the browser agent for additional apps. Browser apps index features The browser applications index shows your app names, their health status, and summary information, with direct links to additional pages. The index shows a list of your application names, their color-coded health status, and user experience summaries based on the current time frame selected in the time picker. This includes: Page load time, SPA response time, and throughput (pages per minute) AJAX response time and throughput (requests per minute) JavaScript errors Browser app name Apps that are also monitored by APM take their name from the app's settings in APM. For apps monitored by browser and not APM, their name is the one provided when you installed browser. To view a browser app's Summary page: From the browser app index, select its name. To change a browser app's name: Follow the procedures to rename your app based on your original deployment method. App status The color-coded health indicator shows each app's current status: Green: Browser monitoring has been enabled and the app is fine. Yellow: A Warning alert indicates the app is experiencing some non-critical issues; for example, the end user Apdex score or error rate crossed a defined threshold for the associated alert policy. Red: A Critical warning indicates an issue has escalated with the app. Gray: No data is being reported for the app at this time. For a quick summary of current conditions, mouse over the app's colored status bar. List functions Here are some tips for using the browserbrowser applications index. If you want to... Do this... Change the sort order Select any column heading to sort the list in ascending or descending order. View a summary of an app's browser monitoring Select the application's name to go to the browser Summary page for that app. Search for specific apps To narrow the search, type one or more characters in the Search filter. To broaden the search, clear the filter. View browser performance details for an app Select any of the corresponding links. For example, select the app's Page load time or Page load throughput link to go directly to the Page views page. If page load timing has been enabled (the app's health status is green) but the browser apps index does not show any summary data (0 ppm), this means there has been no traffic recently (up to six minutes). Return to the browser apps index From any page in browser, select Browser applications, located above the name of your application.",
