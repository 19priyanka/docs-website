      "body": "The APM Summary page provides general information about the selected app, including web transactions and non-web transactions, Apdex score, CPU usage, throughput (requests per minute or rpm), transaction times, error rate, application activity, and hosts. Tip To get a high-level overview of all your applications and services, use the New Relic explorer. View your app's summary page To reach the Summary page, go to one.newrelic.com > Explorer > Services - APM > (select an app). Use the Explorer to access all your entities, that is, anything we can identify that reports data, from applications and hosts to custom groupings of any elements. Alternatively, you can go to one.newrelic.com > APM > (select an app). For more information, see the documentation about navigating core UI components in New Relic One. View app performance Use the Summary page for a quick summary of your website's performance. Overview charts Some charts include links to APM pages where you can drill down into additional details. APM Summary chart Comments Transactions response time This stacked chart represents the response time of web transactions or non-web transactions in your app. Segments in the chart vary depending on which agent you are using. Some charts may have an independent line for response time that represents the relationship between response time and total time. Also, for your external or background services, you may see data labeled as Web external. For more information about these out-of-process services, use the Externals page. Apdex score This chart measures the performance of your app based on its Apdex T value during the selected time window. To view additional details, hover over the question icon or the chart's End user and App server lines. The End user line charts the Apdex for your browser apps, and the App server line charts the Apdex for your APM apps. Throughput This chart illustrates the requests per minute for either web transactions or non-web transactions. To change the type of transaction, select the Transaction response time chart's dropdown arrow, then select Web or Non-web. Error rate This chart shows the number of errors that have occurred in the current time window. The tooltip that appears when you hover over the Error rate chart shows the combined throughput for both web and non-web transactions. To understand how error rate is calculated, see Application error rate example. Event markers Markers on the main Summary chart indicate events and changes to the app: Black vertical bar: Apdex settings have changed. Blue vertical bar: A deployment marker has been created or another event has occurred, such as a settings change for the app. Yellow or red area: This indicates alert thresholds have been violated. To view additional information, mouse over the marker. Drill-down details Use any of New Relic's standard page functions to drill down into detailed information. Here is a summary of additional options with the APM Summary page. If you want to... Do this... Change how data appears on the main chart Select the chart title's drop-down arrow, and then select your choice of view options, including histograms or percentiles if available. View threshold levels for your app's Apdex score Mouse over the Apdex score ? icon. For non-web transactions, the Apdex chart is blank because Apdex is not applicable to this class of apps. View trends in transaction time, Apdex, and throughput Select the Compare with yesterday and last week checkbox. The checkbox is only available when viewing the Web transaction response time chart with the time picker window Ending now. The checkbox is unavailable if you are viewing histograms, percentiles, or custom dates. View app performance since the last deployment From the time picker, select Performance since the last deployment. For detailed information about all deployments, select the Deployments page. View the Transactions page Select the Transactions table's heading on the APM Summary page. Or, to view details about a specific transaction (including operations, transaction traces, and key transactions), select its name. View the Databases or External services pages Click on a related time band in the Web transactions response time chart. View the Errors page Select the Error rate chart's title on the APM Summary page. You can also view the Errors page from one.newrelic.com > (select an app) > Events > Errors. Browser monitoring data If you install the browser agent via an APM agent, you can automatically link the browser-monitored app to the APM-monitored app. Once the browser agent is set up, the APM Summary page provides summary information and direct links to detailed information on the app's corresponding browser summary page. To view chart details with browser page load time, select the main chart's Browser link. To view the Apdex score for browsers, select the Apdex chart's Browser link. Link app performance to resources The APM Summary page shows a table with averages about your app's instances on their hosts, including: Apdex Response time Throughput Error rate CPU usage Memory Tip CPU usage percentage is calculated as though the application is running on one CPU core. For more information about this calculation, see CPU usage is over 100%. Examine app performance within system context Use any of these options to examine your app's performance within the context of your system's architecture and resources, such as individual hosts: Select your choice from the table at the bottom of the APM Summary page for infrastructure. Toggle between a table view or breakout metric details. If applicable, select your choice from the drop-down at the top of the APM Summary page for servers or JVMs. Examine details within infrastructure To help you understand the full context of your app's performance within your environment, New Relic APM includes options to view performance from inside the application, as well as from outside the application with the infrastructure agent. To view detailed information from your resources' point of view, click any host link. The link takes you directly to the infrastructure Compute page. When you click, the Compute data may not immediately appear. If that happens, follow the prompt to validate your account and complete the conversion process for the infrastructure agent. If you need additional help, get support at support.newrelic.com. Troubleshoot host link To troubleshoot the host link from the APM Summary page, use these tips: Host link from APM Summary Troubleshooting tips Your infrastructure agent is not installed on the host. Follow standard procedures to install our infrastructure agent. The application is operating within a container, and your infrastructure agent is installed on the container’s host. Set the hostname for the container to be the hostname of the underlying server. Docker containers: Run your Docker container with the argument: --uts=\"host\" Copy This will cause the container to share the UTS Linux Namespace with the underlying host. However, by using this set, a privileged container could change the host's hostname. The application is running on a Windows container, and your infrastructure agent is installed on the Windows host. To get a direct link to infrastructure metric data for your application, enable process metrics in the infrastructure agent's configuration. Your infrastructure agent is installed, but it only reports the short hostname, not the long hostname. Configure your server's hostname settings so that the infrastructure agent and the APM agent return the exact same name string. If possible, do so by editing your server's fully qualified domain name (FQDN) settings. The APM and infrastructure agents both read their hostname from the operating system's FQDN settings, so setting the hostname there ensures both agents share a single hostname. For more information, see the Java agent troubleshooting example.",

      "body": "In order to report request queuing, New Relic agents depend on an HTTP header set by the front-end web server (such as Apache or Nginx) or load balancer (such as HAProxy or F5). These examples use the X-Request-Start header, since it is has broader support across platforms. If this does not work with your server configuration for request queuing, try using the X-Queue-Start header. The syntax should otherwise be the same. Apache Apache's mod_headers module includes a %t variable that is formatted correctly. To enable request queue reporting, add this code to your Apache config: RequestHeader set X-Request-Start \"%t\" Copy Nginx If you are using Nginx version 1.2.6 or higher and the latest version of the Ruby, Python, or PHP agent, Nginx can easily be configured to report queue time. (For Nginx versions 1.2.6 or lower, you must recompile Nginx with a module or patch.) Configuring with Nginx 1.2.6 or higher uses the ${msec} variable, which is a number in seconds with milliseconds resolution. For more information, see http://nginx.org/en/docs/http/ngx_http_core_module.html#variables. Add the appropriate information to your Nginx config: Nginx configuration Values General Nginx use proxy_set_header X-Request-Start \"t=${msec}\"; Copy Passenger Version 5 or higher: >passenger_set_header X-REQUEST-START \"t=${msec}\"; Copy Older versions: passenger_set_cgi_param X_REQUEST_START \"t=${msec}\"; Copy fastcgi fastcgi_param HTTP_X_REQUEST_START \"t=${msec}\"; Copy uWSGI uwsgi_param HTTP_X_REQUEST_START \"t=${msec}\"; Copy F5 load balancers For F5 load balancers, use this configuration snippet: when HTTP_REQUEST_SEND { # TCL 8.4 so we have to calculate the time in millisecond resolution # Calculation from: https://groups.google.com/forum/? fromgroups=#!topic/comp.lang.tcl/tV9H6TDv0t8 set secs [clock seconds] set ms [clock clicks -milliseconds] set base [expr { $secs * 1000 }] set fract [expr { $ms - $base }] if { $fract >= 1000 } { set diff [expr { $fract / 1000 }] incr secs $diff incr fract [expr { -1000 * $diff }] } set micros [format \"%d%03d000\" $secs $fract] # Want this header inserted as if coming from the client clientside { HTTP::header insert X-Request-Start \"t=${micros}\" } } Copy Network timing Even with request queuing configured, the front-end server's setup can still affect network time in your browser data. This is because the front-end server does not add the queuing time header until after it actually accepts and processes the request. The queuing time headers can never account for backlog in the listener socket used to accept requests. For example, if the front-end server's configuration results in a backlog of requests that queue in the listener socket, page load timing will show an increase in network time.",

The APM and infrastructure agents both read their hostname from the operating system's FQDN settings, so setting the hostname there ensures both agents share a single hostname.

      "body": "Request queuing occurs before the request reaches your application (where the agent resides). This is why you need to do some straightforward configuration of the agent and your production hosts to take advantage of this feature. HTTP header In order to report request queuing, most New Relic agents depend on an HTTP header set by the front-end web server (such as Apache or Nginx) or load balancer (such as HAProxy or F5). You can configure these front-end servers to set the timestamp in the HTTP header that represents when the request first entered your production infrastructure. Tip Set this header as soon after the request enters your infrastructure as possible so that you are less likely to miss performance problems in your infrastructure that occur before the header is set. Most New Relic agents will interpret an X-Queue-Start or X-Request-Start header and use it to calculate Request Queuing. The agents treat these headers identically. Include a value in the format t=MICROSECONDS_SINCE_EPOCH where MICROSECONDS_SINCE_EPOCH is an integer value of the number of microseconds that have elapsed since the beginning of the Unix epoch (for example, January 1, 1970). Nearly any front-end HTTP server or load balancer can be configured to add this header. Additional details depend on your specific agent and server configuration. For more information, see the request queue configuration examples. C SDK The C SDK does not support request queuing. Go agent With the Go agent, set either header to record a metric for it. Java, Node.js, Python, Ruby agents The most recent versions of the Java, Node.js, Python, and Ruby agents provide more flexibility in the format of the X-Request-Start or X-Queue-Start header. These agents allow the timestamp to be submitted in seconds, milliseconds, or microseconds as an integer or floating point value. These agents also allow the leading t= in the header value to be omitted. Based on the order of magnitude, these agents automatically interpret the time unit as seconds, milliseconds, or microseconds. New Relic can do this reliably since a millisecond timestamp, interpreted as microseconds, would result in a queue time over 40 years. Python agent only: When using Apache/mod_wsgi 3.4 or higher, mod_wsgi will automatically insert an equivalent to the X-Queue-Start header into the WSGI environ dictionary for each request. This will mark the specific point in time where Apache first accepted the request. The value set by mod_wsgi will be picked up and used by the Python agent if no separate X-Request-Start or X-Queue-Start header has been manually configured into a web server's front end or in Apache itself. .NET agent The .NET agent does not require (and will ignore) any configuration of HTTP headers to calculate queue time. It works by instrumenting the IIS-queuing mechanism directly and reports queue time as the difference between when the HttpContext constructor executes and when the HttpApplication.BeginRequest event fires. Request queue time is only reported for .NET Framework applications hosted on IIS (for example: ASP.NET applications). It is not reported for ASP .NET Core applications (targeting .NET Core or Framework), nor for self-hosted OWIN applications. PHP agent The PHP agent only supports the X-Request-Start header. This identifies the timestamp in microseconds as an integer, with an optional t= in the header value. To ensure that the header is read properly, check your phpinfo() under the PHP Variables section, and verify that _SERVER[\"HTTP_X_REQUEST_START\"] exists and is in the expected format. If you are using Nginx, see Request queue server configuration examples for additional information on setting the header.",

For rules regarding specific data formats, see: New Relic-format trace data Zipkin-format trace data Endpoints All trace data is sent via HTTPS POST to a Trace API endpoint. We have a few endpoints, depending on your setup: Default Trace API endpoint: https://trace-api.newrelic.com/trace/v1 EU data centers: https://trace-api.eu.newrelic.com/trace/v1 (see other EU endpoints). Infinite Tracing: when you complete the Trace observer setup, you get a custom YOUR_TRACE_OBSERVER_URL value to use as an endpoint. If you're using an integration that uses the Trace API (for example, these integrations), you must configure that integration with that endpoint. You will also want to adjust the sampling of your tracing service to send us 100% of spans. For FedRAMP, see FedRAMP endpoints. Data formats Currently, the Trace API accepts two types of data formats: zipkin: For reporting Zipkin trace data. Zipkin data must be Zipkin JSON v2. newrelic: For reporting all other trace data. Restricted attributes The attributes in the table below are restricted in the newrelic-format JSON (in the attributes block) and in the zipkin-format JSON (in the tags block). Any values with these keys will be omitted: Restricted attribute Description entityGuid string Unique identifier for the entity that created this span. Generated from service.name, if available. guid string Used for backwards compatibility with data from APM agents. The attributes in the table below are used internally to identify entities. Any values submitted with these keys in the attributes section of a metric data point may cause undefined behavior such as missing entities in the UI or telemetry not associating with the expected entities. For more information please refer to Entity synthesis: Restricted attribute description entity.guid string Unique identifier for the entity associated with this span. entity.name string Human-readable name of an entity, often used to identify an entity in the UI. entity.type string Used to differentiate between different types of entities, like hosts, applications, etc. Request metadata (headers and query parameters) The following table shows the required request metadata for all trace data formats. This metadata can be sent as HTTP headers on an ingest request or, in some cases, provided as query parameters, which may be required for tracing frameworks that don't allow header modification. Important Security note: We suggest using headers because query parameters are present in the URL and may be logged before being encrypted and received by New Relic. All data sent as query parameters must be URL-safe. Header Query param? Details Content-Type No Required. Must be application/json. Content-Length No Required. The length of the request body in octets (8-bit bytes) unless sent with chunked encoding. This header is generally set by default by the underlying HTTP client sending the data and in most cases should not require any additional effort by the end user. Api-Key Yes (case-sensitive) Required. The Trace API requires a license key. If this is provided as both a header and a query parameter, the values must match. Content-Encoding No Required if compressed payload. The value must be gzip. Data-Format Yes Required for zipkin. Optional for newrelic. If present, Data-Format-Version must also be present. Data-Format-Version Yes Required for zipkin. If present, Data-Format must also be present. There are only two possible pairings for these values: If Data-Format is zipkin, Data-Format-Version must be 2. If Data-Format is newrelic, Data-Format-Version must be 1. x-request-id No Optional - Reserved for future use. The value must be a valid UUID4. The value is expected to be unique for each request. Response validation A response for successfully sending trace data will include a requestId. For example: {\"requestId\":\"c1bb62fc-001a-b000-0000-016bb152e1bb\"} Copy There are two ways success/errors are signaled: HTTP status code (synchronous). Authentication and request errors will be signaled via HTTP status code. See HTTP status codes Code Meaning 202 Data accepted. This means that you've passed preliminary checks, but is not a guarantee that the data has been successfully parsed and indexed as part of a distributed trace. 400 The structure of the request was invalid. Errors with query parameters, etc. 403 Authentication error. May occur with an invalid license key or if you lack necessary entitlement to use the Trace API. 404 The request path is incorrect. 405 For any request method other than POST. 408 The request took too long to reach the endpoint. 411 The Content-Length header wasn’t included. 413 The payload was too big. 414 The request URI was too long. 415 The Content-Type or Content-Encoding was invalid. 429 The request rate quota has been exceeded. 431 The request headers are too long. 5xx There was a server error (please retry). NrIntegrationError events (asynchronous). Errors with the JSON payload or other semantic errors are asynchronously signaled via NrIntegrationError events that are stored in the account whose license key is associated with the request. For all errors of this type, the attribute newRelicFeature will be Distributed Tracing and requestId will be the requestId from the endpoint response. If you receive a 202 response and don't see an NrIntegrationError event, your data should be visible in New Relic One's global distributed tracing UI in about a minute. You should be able to find the trace using a standard trace search like: traceId = TRACE_ID_SENT Copy Data limits Distributed tracing rate limits are set per account and data type. For details about data limits, see New Relic data usage limits and policies. When you exceed your span rate limit, an NrIntegrationError event is generated. You can query rate limit messages with this NRQL: SELECT * FROM NrIntegrationError WHERE newRelicFeature = 'Distributed Tracing' AND category = 'RateLimit' AND rateLimitType = 'SpansPerMinute' Copy To get a notification when you exceed the limit, you can set up a NRQL alert. We calculate a rolling 10-minute average based on your span rate limit. This allows for temporary rate bursts, and lets us prioritize keeping and dropping complete traces instead of indiscriminately dropping spans on a per minute limit basis. In the example below of exceeding the rate, the rate limit is the default 100,000 spans per minute. New Relic allows a burst above 100K for a couple of minutes without downsampling, because the remaining minutes in the 10-minute window averaged under 100K spans/minute. For the previous 10 minutes (8:50 - 9:00) the service received 60,000 spans/minute. Minute Spans sent to API Total for past 10 minutes 8:59 60,000 600,000 9:00 40,000 580,000 9:01 50,000 570,000 9:02 250,000 760,000 9:03 220,000 920,000 9:04 125,000 985,000 9:05 70,000 995,000 9:06 50,000 985,000 9:07 40,000 965,000 9:08 40,000 945,000 9:09 40,000 925,000",

This API is also how trace data from some of our integrations and exporters is reported to New Relic. Want to try out the Trace API? Make sure you've created a free New Relic account. No credit card required. To skip some introductory content and get started quickly, go to Start reporting data. What is the Trace API? The Trace API is one way that New Relic collects distributed tracing data. We have some tracing tools that report data via this API (Infinite Tracing, our open source integrations, and our Telemetry SDKs), or you can use the API directly to create your own tracing implementation. Reasons to use the Trace API: You have your own custom distributed tracing tool and want to see that data in New Relic without changing your instrumentation. You have a tool that emits tracing data but that requires a backend for trace storage. You want to report distributed tracing data to New Relic without the use of our installed solutions. You use Zipkin and want to see that trace data in New Relic without changing your instrumentation. Want to understand how trace data relates to other New Relic data? Read about our data types. Requirements For details about what data you can send and how it is handled, see Rules and limits. Sampling considerations When using the Trace API, you have the option to enable Infinite Tracing. Whether you use Infinite Tracing has implications for how you configure sampling: Use your own sampling (no Infinite Tracing): If you don't use Infinite Tracing, it's assumed you want to use your own sampling implementation to sample traces before they're sent to us. (If your trace data exceeds our data limits, we do enact sampling.) Use Infinite Tracing: If you want to use Infinite Tracing, a typical approach is to send us 100% of your trace data and rely on Infinite Tracing sampling. (When you go through the Start reporting data instructions, below, you'll have an option for enabling Infinite Tracing.) Start reporting data The Trace API accepts trace data in these two JSON formats: zipkin: the Zipkin JSON v2 trace data format (learn what Zipkin is).

      "body": "If you want to create your own tracing implementation, you can use our Trace API. This doc explains how to send traces in our general format, aka new-relic format. (To send Zipkin-format data, see Zipkin.) Get started Using our Trace API is as simple as: Sending trace data in the expected format (in this case, our new-relic format). Sending that data to the appropriate endpoint. Before using the Trace API, you should decide whether you want to use Infinite Tracing. To learn more about this, see Intro to Infinite Tracing and Sampling considerations. To get started using the Trace API, follow one of these paths: Want to use Infinite Tracing? Follow the Set up a trace observer instructions. That walks you through creating a trace observer and sending a sample payload to the trace observer endpoint. Don't want Infinite Tracing? See how to send a sample payload (below). Send sample trace payload (non-Infinite Tracing) The following explains how to send a standard (non-Infinite Tracing) payload to the Trace API using our newrelic format. Get a license key for the account you want to report data to. Insert that key into the following JSON and then send the JSON to our endpoint. Note: if you have a EU New Relic account, use the EU endpoint instead. curl -i -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \\ -H 'Api-Key: $YOUR_LICENSE_KEY' \\ -H 'Data-Format: newrelic' \\ -H 'Data-Format-Version: 1' \\ -X POST \\ -d '[ { \"common\": { \"attributes\": { \"service.name\": \"Test Service A\", \"host\": \"host123.example.com\" } }, \"spans\": [ { \"trace.id\": \"123456\", \"id\": \"ABC\", \"attributes\": { \"duration.ms\": 12.53, \"name\": \"/home\" } }, { \"trace.id\": \"123456\", \"id\": \"DEF\", \"attributes\": { \"error.message\": \"Invalid credentials\", \"service.name\": \"Test Service A\", \"host\": \"host456.example.com\", \"duration.ms\": 2.97, \"name\": \"/auth\", \"parent.id\": \"ABC\" } } ] } ]' 'https://trace-api.newrelic.com/trace/v1' Copy Tip If you're sending more than one POST, change the trace.id to a unique value. Sending the same payload or span id multiple times for the same trace.id may result in fragmented traces in the UI. If your test returned HTTP/1.1 202 Accepted, go to our UI to see a query of your test data using the span attribute service.name = Test Service A. Tip Traces may take up to one minute to be processed by both the trace observer and the Trace API. Trace API payload (New Relic format) The Trace API JSON payload is an array of objects, with each object representing a single trace. Each of these objects requires a spans key and may also include a common key. spans (required) contains an array of objects, with each object representing a span. common (optional) shares information across multiple spans. The Span object in the spans array field type description required default id string Unique identifier for this span. yes N/A trace.id string Unique identifier shared by all spans within a single trace. yes N/A timestamp long Span start time in milliseconds since the Unix epoch. no Current time in UTC timezone attributes object Any set of key: value pairs that add more details about a span. duration.ms, name, and parent.id are strongly recommended to add. no N/A Requests without the required keys above will be rejected, and an NrIntegrationError will be generated. The common object (optional) field type description required default attributes object Any set of key: value pairs that add common details about spans in the payload. If a span contains an attribute that has been set in common, the key in the span attributes object will take precedence. duration.ms, name, and parent.id are strongly recommended to add. no N/A Highly recommended attributes While not required, these attributes should be included for the best experience with your data in the attributes object for each span. attribute default description duration.ms float none Duration of this span in milliseconds. name string none The name of this span. parent.id string none The id of the caller of this span. Value is null if this is the root span. Traces without a root span will not be displayed. service.name string none The name of the entity that created this span. Reserved attributes These attributes are currently reserved for internal New Relic usage. While they are not explicitly blocked, we recommend not using them. attribute default description entity.name string service.name This is derived from the service.name attribute. entity.type string service The entity type is assumed to be a service. entity.guid string None The entity.guid is a derived value that uniquely identifies the entity in New Relic's backend. Other attributes You can add any arbitrary attributes you want in the attributes object in either common or each span object, with the exception of the restricted attributes. For example, you might want to add attributes like customer.id or user.id to help you analyze your trace data. Requirements and guidelines for trace JSON using the newrelic format: Each JSON payload is an array of objects. Each object should contain a required spans key. Each object can contain an optional common key. Use this if you want to share information across multiple spans in a object. Any keys on a span have precedence over the same key in the common block. The value for a spans key is a list of span objects. Certain attributes are required, and must be included either in the optional common block, or in each span. Recommended and custom attributes can be optionally included in a list of key-value pairs under a key named attributes, in the optional common block and/or in each span. In the following example POST, there are two spans, both of which have the trace.id 12345 and the custom attribute host: host123.example.com. The first span has no parent.id, so that is the root of the trace; the second span's parent.id points to the ID of the first.

      "body": "The APM Summary page provides general information about the selected app, including web transactions and non-web transactions, Apdex score, CPU usage, throughput (requests per minute or rpm), transaction times, error rate, application activity, and hosts. Tip To get a high-level overview of all your applications and services, use the New Relic explorer. View your app's summary page To reach the Summary page, go to one.newrelic.com > Explorer > Services - APM > (select an app). Use the Explorer to access all your entities, that is, anything we can identify that reports data, from applications and hosts to custom groupings of any elements. Alternatively, you can go to one.newrelic.com > APM > (select an app). For more information, see the documentation about navigating core UI components in New Relic One. View app performance Use the Summary page for a quick summary of your website's performance. Overview charts Some charts include links to APM pages where you can drill down into additional details. APM Summary chart Comments Transactions response time This stacked chart represents the response time of web transactions or non-web transactions in your app. Segments in the chart vary depending on which agent you are using. Some charts may have an independent line for response time that represents the relationship between response time and total time. Also, for your external or background services, you may see data labeled as Web external. For more information about these out-of-process services, use the Externals page. Apdex score This chart measures the performance of your app based on its Apdex T value during the selected time window. To view additional details, hover over the question icon or the chart's End user and App server lines. The End user line charts the Apdex for your browser apps, and the App server line charts the Apdex for your APM apps. Throughput This chart illustrates the requests per minute for either web transactions or non-web transactions. To change the type of transaction, select the Transaction response time chart's dropdown arrow, then select Web or Non-web. Error rate This chart shows the number of errors that have occurred in the current time window. The tooltip that appears when you hover over the Error rate chart shows the combined throughput for both web and non-web transactions. To understand how error rate is calculated, see Application error rate example. Event markers Markers on the main Summary chart indicate events and changes to the app: Black vertical bar: Apdex settings have changed. Blue vertical bar: A deployment marker has been created or another event has occurred, such as a settings change for the app. Yellow or red area: This indicates alert thresholds have been violated. To view additional information, mouse over the marker. Drill-down details Use any of New Relic's standard page functions to drill down into detailed information. Here is a summary of additional options with the APM Summary page. If you want to... Do this... Change how data appears on the main chart Select the chart title's drop-down arrow, and then select your choice of view options, including histograms or percentiles if available. View threshold levels for your app's Apdex score Mouse over the Apdex score ? icon. For non-web transactions, the Apdex chart is blank because Apdex is not applicable to this class of apps. View trends in transaction time, Apdex, and throughput Select the Compare with yesterday and last week checkbox. The checkbox is only available when viewing the Web transaction response time chart with the time picker window Ending now. The checkbox is unavailable if you are viewing histograms, percentiles, or custom dates. View app performance since the last deployment From the time picker, select Performance since the last deployment. For detailed information about all deployments, select the Deployments page. View the Transactions page Select the Transactions table's heading on the APM Summary page. Or, to view details about a specific transaction (including operations, transaction traces, and key transactions), select its name. View the Databases or External services pages Click on a related time band in the Web transactions response time chart. View the Errors page Select the Error rate chart's title on the APM Summary page. You can also view the Errors page from one.newrelic.com > (select an app) > Events > Errors. Browser monitoring data If you install the browser agent via an APM agent, you can automatically link the browser-monitored app to the APM-monitored app. Once the browser agent is set up, the APM Summary page provides summary information and direct links to detailed information on the app's corresponding browser summary page. To view chart details with browser page load time, select the main chart's Browser link. To view the Apdex score for browsers, select the Apdex chart's Browser link. Link app performance to resources The APM Summary page shows a table with averages about your app's instances on their hosts, including: Apdex Response time Throughput Error rate CPU usage Memory Tip CPU usage percentage is calculated as though the application is running on one CPU core. For more information about this calculation, see CPU usage is over 100%. Examine app performance within system context Use any of these options to examine your app's performance within the context of your system's architecture and resources, such as individual hosts: Select your choice from the table at the bottom of the APM Summary page for infrastructure. Toggle between a table view or breakout metric details. If applicable, select your choice from the drop-down at the top of the APM Summary page for servers or JVMs. Examine details within infrastructure To help you understand the full context of your app's performance within your environment, New Relic APM includes options to view performance from inside the application, as well as from outside the application with the infrastructure agent. To view detailed information from your resources' point of view, click any host link. The link takes you directly to the infrastructure Compute page. When you click, the Compute data may not immediately appear. If that happens, follow the prompt to validate your account and complete the conversion process for the infrastructure agent. If you need additional help, get support at support.newrelic.com. Troubleshoot host link To troubleshoot the host link from the APM Summary page, use these tips: Host link from APM Summary Troubleshooting tips Your infrastructure agent is not installed on the host. Follow standard procedures to install our infrastructure agent. The application is operating within a container, and your infrastructure agent is installed on the container’s host. Set the hostname for the container to be the hostname of the underlying server. Docker containers: Run your Docker container with the argument: --uts=\"host\" Copy This will cause the container to share the UTS Linux Namespace with the underlying host. However, by using this set, a privileged container could change the host's hostname. The application is running on a Windows container, and your infrastructure agent is installed on the Windows host. To get a direct link to infrastructure metric data for your application, enable process metrics in the infrastructure agent's configuration. Your infrastructure agent is installed, but it only reports the short hostname, not the long hostname. Configure your server's hostname settings so that the infrastructure agent and the APM agent return the exact same name string. If possible, do so by editing your server's fully qualified domain name (FQDN) settings. The APM and infrastructure agents both read their hostname from the operating system's FQDN settings, so setting the hostname there ensures both agents share a single hostname. For more information, see the Java agent troubleshooting example.",

Our APM agents give you real-time observability matched with trending data about your application's performance and the user experience. Agents reveal what is happening deep in your code with end to end transaction tracing and a variety of color-coded charts and reports. Identify problems before your users do Our APM agents report and store the state of your application so you can quickly identify potential problems before they affect your end users. With APM, your DevOps teams don't need to guess whether a performance blocker comes from the app itself, CPU availability, database loads, or something entirely unexpected. Use our APM solutions to gather both current and historical information about memory usage, CPU utilization, database query performance, web browser rendering performance, app availability, error analysis, external services, and other useful metrics. We have agents for Go, Java, .NET, Node.js, PHP, Python, and Ruby, as well as a C SDK. Monitor all aspects of your business Take advantage of these APM features, and more: Features Description App performance at a glance When you sign in to APM and select an app for your account, use the Summary page to quickly examine relationships across different aspects of your environment; for example: Web transactions response time: Where is the most time being spent? In the request queue, during different stages of page rendering and execution, from external services, or something else? Transaction traces: Which transactions are the slowest, and why? Error rate and throughput: What relationship is there between a spike in errors or slower throughput for a particular time period? Was there a deployment or outage at that time? Hosts: What kind of impact does this have on CPU usage, memory, etc.? Apdex: How are these events affecting customers' satisfaction with the site? Web and non-web transactions Start by comparing the top twenty web transactions or non-web transactions in terms of most time consuming, slowest average response time, highest throughput, or worst Apdex. From there, drill down into deeper trace levels for individual transactions, which in turn break down into smaller segments and components, from HTTPS requests on down to SQL queries. Want to explore even deeper? Set up distributed tracing to see how requests move across a distributed system. Select the transactions that are most important to your business (key transactions). APM and Infrastructure When your APM and Infrastructure accounts are linked, you will have access to APM data charts on these Infrastructure UI pages: Hosts, Network, Storage, and Processes. Distributed tracing Distributed tracing gives you visibility across distributed systems, showing you the path of a request as it travels between services. This feature is especially valuable for large, distributed systems that rely on many small services and microservices. Logs Bring your logs and APM agent data together to see logs associated with various objects in the New Relic UI such as applications, APM errors, APM traces, and Kubernetes containers. Service maps APM's service maps show your app's connections and dependencies, including databases and external services. Health indicators and performance metrics show you the current operational status for every part of your architecture. You can create and customize service maps to visualize and monitor your complex architectures. Query your data You can query and visualize your data: Sample and search APM transaction and error data to gain full understanding of the data being collected. Browse your data visually with the data explorer. Create custom SQL-like queries of your data using the New Relic Query Language (NRQL), or using our PromQL-style queries. Use dashboards to build advanced data visualizations, contextualize data, and understand what's going on in your system, real-time. These are just a few of APM's features. To find out more, see the table of contents for APM. Ready to get started? Start benefiting from APM in 5 simple steps (and just a few minutes!). Sign up for a New Relic account (it's free, forever!). Install and customize the language agent for your app. Generate some traffic for your app. Wait a few minutes for New Relic to start receiving your data. Log in to your account, and start exploring New Relic! Use the Explorer in New Relic One to access and observe the full stack of your software, including your apps, see performance data and alerting status at a glance, and check relationships. We provide you with a simple, yet powerful visual tool to monitor all your entities, that is, anything we can identify that reports data. In the New Relic ecosystem, entities include basic components like applications, hosts, containers, or database services, but it can also refer to custom groupings of such elements. You can also create your own entities. If data does not appear after waiting a few minutes, follow the troubleshooting tips for your APM agent.",

Monitor all aspects of your business Take advantage of these APM features, and more: Features Description App performance at a glance When you sign in to APM and select an app for your account, use the Summary page to quickly examine relationships across different aspects of your environment; for example: Web transactions response time: Where is the most time being spent? In the request queue, during different stages of page rendering and execution, from external services, or something else? Transaction traces: Which transactions are the slowest, and why? Error rate and throughput: What relationship is there between a spike in errors or slower throughput for a particular time period? Was there a deployment or outage at that time? Hosts: What kind of impact does this have on CPU usage, memory, etc.? Apdex: How are these events affecting customers' satisfaction with the site? Web and non-web transactions Start by comparing the top twenty web transactions or non-web transactions in terms of most time consuming, slowest average response time, highest throughput, or worst Apdex. From there, drill down into deeper trace levels for individual transactions, which in turn break down into smaller segments and components, from HTTPS requests on down to SQL queries. Want to explore even deeper? Set up distributed tracing to see how requests move across a distributed system. Select the transactions that are most important to your business (key transactions). APM and Infrastructure When your APM and Infrastructure accounts are linked, you will have access to APM data charts on these Infrastructure UI pages: Hosts, Network, Storage, and Processes. Distributed tracing Distributed tracing gives you visibility across distributed systems, showing you the path of a request as it travels between services. This feature is especially valuable for large, distributed systems that rely on many small services and microservices. Logs Bring your logs and APM agent data together to see logs associated with various objects in the New Relic UI such as applications, APM errors, APM traces, and Kubernetes containers. Service maps APM's service maps show your app's connections and dependencies, including databases and external services. Health indicators and performance metrics show you the current operational status for every part of your architecture. You can create and customize service maps to visualize and monitor your complex architectures. Query your data You can query and visualize your data: Sample and search APM transaction and error data to gain full understanding of the data being collected. Browse your data visually with the data explorer. Create custom SQL-like queries of your data using the New Relic Query Language (NRQL), or using our PromQL-style queries. Use dashboards to build advanced data visualizations, contextualize data, and understand what's going on in your system, real-time. These are just a few of APM's features. To find out more, see the table of contents for APM. Ready to get started? Start benefiting from APM in 5 simple steps (and just a few minutes!). Sign up for a New Relic account (it's free, forever!). Install and customize the language agent for your app. Generate some traffic for your app. Wait a few minutes for New Relic to start receiving your data. Log in to your account, and start exploring New Relic! Use the Explorer in New Relic One to access and observe the full stack of your software, including your apps, see performance data and alerting status at a glance, and check relationships. We provide you with a simple, yet powerful visual tool to monitor all your entities, that is, anything we can identify that reports data. In the New Relic ecosystem, entities include basic components like applications, hosts, containers, or database services, but it can also refer to custom groupings of such elements. You can also create your own entities. If data does not appear after waiting a few minutes, follow the troubleshooting tips for your APM agent.",

      "body": "Apdex is an industry standard to measure users' satisfaction with the response time of web applications and services. It's a simplified Service Level Agreement (SLA) solution that helps you see how satisfied users are with your app through metrics such as Apdex score and dissatisfaction percentage instead of easily skewed traditional metrics such as average response time. Apdex measurements Apdex is a measure of response time based against a set threshold. It measures the ratio of satisfactory response times to unsatisfactory response times. The response time is measured from an asset request to completed delivery back to the requestor. After you define a response time threshold T, all responses handled in T or less time satisfy the user. For example, if T is 1.2 seconds and a response completes in 0.5 seconds, then the user is satisfied. All responses greater than 1.2 seconds dissatisfy the user. Responses greater than 4.8 seconds frustrate the user. You can define multiple Apdex T values for each of these: Apdex measurements Comments APM apps APM monitors the performance of these apps. To define their Apdex settings, use the APM UI. You can find Apdex on the APM Summary page and the browser Summary page. Browser apps Browser monitors the end-user experience for these apps. To define end-user Apdex settings for these apps, use the browser UI. New Relic labels them as End user on the APM Overview page and the browser Overview page. Key transactions These are transactions important to your business that you choose to monitor. You can define Apdex settings for key transactions on the Key transactions page. Important The key transaction Apdex setting overrides the T value of that app. For details, see Key transaction Apdex. Apdex levels Apdex tracks three response counts: Satisfied: The response time is less than or equal to T. Tolerating: The response time is greater than T and less than or equal to 4T. In this example, 4 x 1.2 = 4.8 seconds is the maximum tolerable response time. Frustrated: The response time is greater than 4T or the request returns a server-side error. A high error rate can cause you to have a satisfying average response time, yet a poor Apdex score. Your configuration file's apdex_f value is four times your app server's Apdex T value. This threshold is useful, for example, with transaction traces. For more information, see the configuration file documentation for your New Relic agent. The time calculation will change based on your own app's T setting. In the following example, T = 1.2 seconds. Level Multiplier Time (T Example = 1.2) Satisfied T or less < = 1.2 seconds Tolerated > T, < = 4T Between 1.2 and 4.8 seconds Frustrated > 4T Greater than 4.8 seconds After you define your Apdex levels, use any of New Relic's resources to help identify and troubleshoot changes that indicate poor customer experiences with your app. Apdex score The Apdex score is a ratio value of the number of satisfied and tolerating requests to the total requests made. Each satisfied request counts as one request, while each tolerating request counts as half a satisfied request. An Apdex score varies from 0 to 1, with 0 as the worst possible score (100% of response times were Frustrated), and 1 as the best possible score (100% of response times were Satisfied). Example Apdex score: During a 2 minute period a host handles 200 requests. The Apdex threshold T = 0.5 seconds (500ms). This value is arbitrary and is selected by the user. 170 of the requests were handled within 500ms, so they are classified as Satisfied. 20 of the requests were handled between 500ms and 2 seconds (2000 ms), so they are classified as Tolerating. The remaining 10 were not handled properly or took longer than 2 seconds, so they are classified as Frustrated. The resulting Apdex score is 0.9: (170 + (20/2))/200 = 0.9. Important The formula used for calculating the Apdex score is designed for high-throughput apps. If your app's throughput is less than 100 RPM, not enough data is collected to determine a stable score. The instability may result in Apdex alert conditions behaving unexpectedly. Errors pages Any request that returns a server-side error such as 500: Application Error is a frustrating response, regardless of its return speed. You can use Apdex to visualize the impact of these errors, and then identify and resolve these errors with New Relic's built-in error analytics and error profile tools. Dissatisfaction percentage The dissatisfaction percentage is the percentage of the total dissatisfaction experienced by the app's users that is contributed by this transaction. Example Apdex dissatisfaction calculation: Frustrations(Transaction) + Tolerations(Transaction)/2 Frustrations(App) + Tolerations(App)/2 To visualize dissatisfaction percentage, you can sort your transactions by most dissatisfying. If a transaction is always frustratingly slow but rarely visited, it will not contribute much to the app's total dissatisfaction. Conversely, if a transaction is normally fast, but has high throughput, this may contribute a large proportion of the app's dissatisfaction simply because it contributes a large proportion of your app's traffic.",

Apdex T is the response time above which a transaction is considered \"tolerable.\" You can define Apdex T values for each application, with separate values for app server and end-user browser performance. You can also define individual Apdex T thresholds for key transactions. Important You can only change Apdex thresholds for apps that are actively reporting data. For example, if one of your apps is not reporting, you won't see its Apdex setting options. App server Apdex settings The default Apdex T threshold for an application server is 0.5 seconds. To change the default application server threshold for web transactions: Go to one.newrelic.com > (select an app) > Settings > Application > Application settings. From the Application server section, set the Apdex T value (in seconds) for this application. Select Save application settings. After you change Apdex settings, a black vertical bar appears in the main chart on the APM Summary page. End-user (Browser) Apdex settings The default Apdex T threshold for browser monitoring is 7.0 seconds. To change the default end user threshold for Apdex T: Go to one.newrelic.com > Browser > (select an app) > Settings > Application settings. From the Settings page, set the end user Apdex T value (in seconds). Select Save application settings. Key transaction Apdex settings You can set custom Apdex values for your key transactions. These values are independent of the APM and browser Apdex values for the key transaction's parent application. Key transactions will contribute to the overall Apdex score based on their own Apdex T values. The default values are inherited from the parent application. Apdex alerting You can also configure alert conditions for Apdex. When the Apdex score passes the threshold you define, New Relic sends an alert to the notification mechanism (channel).

Identify problems before your users do Our APM agents report and store the state of your application so you can quickly identify potential problems before they affect your end users. With APM, your DevOps teams don't need to guess whether a performance blocker comes from the app itself, CPU availability, database loads, or something entirely unexpected. Use our APM solutions to gather both current and historical information about memory usage, CPU utilization, database query performance, web browser rendering performance, app availability, error analysis, external services, and other useful metrics. We have agents for Go, Java, .NET, Node.js, PHP, Python, and Ruby, as well as a C SDK. Monitor all aspects of your business Take advantage of these APM features, and more: Features Description App performance at a glance When you sign in to APM and select an app for your account, use the Summary page to quickly examine relationships across different aspects of your environment; for example: Web transactions response time: Where is the most time being spent? In the request queue, during different stages of page rendering and execution, from external services, or something else? Transaction traces: Which transactions are the slowest, and why? Error rate and throughput: What relationship is there between a spike in errors or slower throughput for a particular time period? Was there a deployment or outage at that time? Hosts: What kind of impact does this have on CPU usage, memory, etc.? Apdex: How are these events affecting customers' satisfaction with the site? Web and non-web transactions Start by comparing the top twenty web transactions or non-web transactions in terms of most time consuming, slowest average response time, highest throughput, or worst Apdex. From there, drill down into deeper trace levels for individual transactions, which in turn break down into smaller segments and components, from HTTPS requests on down to SQL queries. Want to explore even deeper? Set up distributed tracing to see how requests move across a distributed system. Select the transactions that are most important to your business (key transactions). APM and Infrastructure When your APM and Infrastructure accounts are linked, you will have access to APM data charts on these Infrastructure UI pages: Hosts, Network, Storage, and Processes. Distributed tracing Distributed tracing gives you visibility across distributed systems, showing you the path of a request as it travels between services. This feature is especially valuable for large, distributed systems that rely on many small services and microservices.

      "body": "Apdex is an industry standard to measure users' satisfaction with the response time of web applications and services. It's a simplified Service Level Agreement (SLA) solution that helps you see how satisfied users are with your app through metrics such as Apdex score and dissatisfaction percentage instead of easily skewed traditional metrics such as average response time. Apdex measurements Apdex is a measure of response time based against a set threshold. It measures the ratio of satisfactory response times to unsatisfactory response times. The response time is measured from an asset request to completed delivery back to the requestor. After you define a response time threshold T, all responses handled in T or less time satisfy the user. For example, if T is 1.2 seconds and a response completes in 0.5 seconds, then the user is satisfied. All responses greater than 1.2 seconds dissatisfy the user. Responses greater than 4.8 seconds frustrate the user. You can define multiple Apdex T values for each of these: Apdex measurements Comments APM apps APM monitors the performance of these apps. To define their Apdex settings, use the APM UI. You can find Apdex on the APM Summary page and the browser Summary page. Browser apps Browser monitors the end-user experience for these apps. To define end-user Apdex settings for these apps, use the browser UI. New Relic labels them as End user on the APM Overview page and the browser Overview page. Key transactions These are transactions important to your business that you choose to monitor. You can define Apdex settings for key transactions on the Key transactions page. Important The key transaction Apdex setting overrides the T value of that app. For details, see Key transaction Apdex. Apdex levels Apdex tracks three response counts: Satisfied: The response time is less than or equal to T. Tolerating: The response time is greater than T and less than or equal to 4T. In this example, 4 x 1.2 = 4.8 seconds is the maximum tolerable response time. Frustrated: The response time is greater than 4T or the request returns a server-side error. A high error rate can cause you to have a satisfying average response time, yet a poor Apdex score. Your configuration file's apdex_f value is four times your app server's Apdex T value. This threshold is useful, for example, with transaction traces. For more information, see the configuration file documentation for your New Relic agent. The time calculation will change based on your own app's T setting. In the following example, T = 1.2 seconds. Level Multiplier Time (T Example = 1.2) Satisfied T or less < = 1.2 seconds Tolerated > T, < = 4T Between 1.2 and 4.8 seconds Frustrated > 4T Greater than 4.8 seconds After you define your Apdex levels, use any of New Relic's resources to help identify and troubleshoot changes that indicate poor customer experiences with your app. Apdex score The Apdex score is a ratio value of the number of satisfied and tolerating requests to the total requests made. Each satisfied request counts as one request, while each tolerating request counts as half a satisfied request. An Apdex score varies from 0 to 1, with 0 as the worst possible score (100% of response times were Frustrated), and 1 as the best possible score (100% of response times were Satisfied). Example Apdex score: During a 2 minute period a host handles 200 requests. The Apdex threshold T = 0.5 seconds (500ms). This value is arbitrary and is selected by the user. 170 of the requests were handled within 500ms, so they are classified as Satisfied. 20 of the requests were handled between 500ms and 2 seconds (2000 ms), so they are classified as Tolerating. The remaining 10 were not handled properly or took longer than 2 seconds, so they are classified as Frustrated. The resulting Apdex score is 0.9: (170 + (20/2))/200 = 0.9. Important The formula used for calculating the Apdex score is designed for high-throughput apps. If your app's throughput is less than 100 RPM, not enough data is collected to determine a stable score. The instability may result in Apdex alert conditions behaving unexpectedly. Errors pages Any request that returns a server-side error such as 500: Application Error is a frustrating response, regardless of its return speed. You can use Apdex to visualize the impact of these errors, and then identify and resolve these errors with New Relic's built-in error analytics and error profile tools. Dissatisfaction percentage The dissatisfaction percentage is the percentage of the total dissatisfaction experienced by the app's users that is contributed by this transaction. Example Apdex dissatisfaction calculation: Frustrations(Transaction) + Tolerations(Transaction)/2 Frustrations(App) + Tolerations(App)/2 To visualize dissatisfaction percentage, you can sort your transactions by most dissatisfying. If a transaction is always frustratingly slow but rarely visited, it will not contribute much to the app's total dissatisfaction. Conversely, if a transaction is normally fast, but has high throughput, this may contribute a large proportion of the app's dissatisfaction simply because it contributes a large proportion of your app's traffic.",

Apdex T is the response time above which a transaction is considered \"tolerable.\" You can define Apdex T values for each application, with separate values for app server and end-user browser performance. You can also define individual Apdex T thresholds for key transactions. Important You can only change Apdex thresholds for apps that are actively reporting data. For example, if one of your apps is not reporting, you won't see its Apdex setting options. App server Apdex settings The default Apdex T threshold for an application server is 0.5 seconds. To change the default application server threshold for web transactions: Go to one.newrelic.com > (select an app) > Settings > Application > Application settings. From the Application server section, set the Apdex T value (in seconds) for this application. Select Save application settings. After you change Apdex settings, a black vertical bar appears in the main chart on the APM Summary page. End-user (Browser) Apdex settings The default Apdex T threshold for browser monitoring is 7.0 seconds.

      "body": "The APM agent that you installed receives data from your applications. The default data retention is based on your pricing edition. New Relic's default security settings automatically work to ensure data privacy and to limit the kind of information New Relic receives. You can also change these settings. Disclosure and audit Our APM agent is a publicly accessible plugin for web applications. The agent does not do any dynamic code generation while communicating with your app, so using the agent will not introduce any code into your application without your knowledge. Most of our agents are open source, so you can see what our code does: C SDK Go .NET Node.js Python Ruby Data collection Using a JSON message format, data the agent receives from your app is posted once a minute to the New Relic user interface. The website returns a JSON response to the agent, indicating if the data was correctly received or if there was an error. New Relic collects the following aggregate metric data: Database activity External web service calls Controller and dispatch activity View activity Uncaught exceptions and counts Process memory and CPU usage This aggregate metric data summarizes calls to specific methods in your application: how many times each one was called and various response time statistics (average, minimum, maximum, and standard deviation). In New Relic, you will see the class and method names along with their aggregate numbers. New Relic optionally collects: Data collection Comments Uncaught errors New Relic captures the error as well as a runtime stack trace of the offending code. Transaction traces These are snapshots of a single transaction. As an option, the agent can also collect the query statements called within the transaction. The default collection uses obfuscation to hide any strings or numbers from the query. For transactions slower than a threshold you set, New Relic also collects data from SQL EXPLAIN. For database calls slower than a configured threshold, New Relic optionally collects runtime stack traces, which are helpful to pinpoint where in the code a database call is made. Custom parameters You can add custom parameters to your application code and record them with transaction traces to provide additional context while you are examining profiling information. Optional: For both errors and transaction traces, the HTTP request parameters can also be recorded. Security settings If you want to restrict the information that New Relic receives, you can enable high security mode. If high security mode or the default settings do not work for your business needs, you can apply custom settings. Default security settings Depending on the agent, the default settings provide security for request parameters, HTTPS usage, and SQL: C SDK default security settings Go default security settings Java default security settings .NET default security settings Node.js default security settings PHP default security settings Python default security settings Ruby default security settings High security mode When the agent is in high security mode, default settings are locked so that users cannot change them. In addition, high security mode applies restrictions to custom events, custom instrumentation, user attributes, exception messages, or message queue parameters, depending on the agent: C SDK: n/a Go high security mode settings Java high security mode settings .NET high security mode settings Node.js high security mode settings PHP high security mode settings Python high security mode settings Ruby high security mode settings Custom security settings If you want custom security settings, you can customize the configuration file, change custom attribute settings, or use the API, depending on your agent: C SDK custom security settings Go custom security settings Java custom security settings .NET custom security mode settings Node.js custom security settings PHP custom security settings Python custom security settings Ruby custom security settings Data received by New Relic This information applies to all APM agents no matter what security settings you have applied. Important Other data that New Relic receives is specific to the security settings for each agent. Data Captured? APM agent language version OS type and version System properties Average response time of transactions in your app URL hits Client IP address Not captured TLS and SSL Our preferred protocol for all domains is TLS 1.2. APM agents enable SSL by default. To verify which release includes SSL by default and to ensure that you have the most up-to-date version, refer to your agent's release notes: C SDK Go Java .NET Node.js PHP Python Ruby The configuration file also includes an optional flag (ssl) to enable or disable SSL using HTTPS. New Relic does not do host authentication with HTTPS, just communication encryption. Exception: You cannot disable SSL for the C SDK. The C SDK daemon can only connect with SSL. New Relic requires HTTPS for all traffic to APM and the REST API. This includes both inbound and outbound traffic. If your REST API call uses HTTP, or if you have disabled SSL in your configuration file, change your script or program to HTTPS. Data transmission Under Java, .NET and PHP, New Relic uses JSON to serialize data. The Ruby agent uses either Ruby marshaling or JSON serialization to send data to New Relic, depending on whether a native JSON encoder is available in under the Ruby version the agent is running on. For required changes when you want to create firewall rules to allow the agent to communicate, see Networks. For more information about security measures for your data in transit to New Relic or at rest in our storage, see Data encryption. Proxies Optional settings are available so that you can configure the agent to communicate through a proxy. To define proxy settings for host, port, domain, user, or password, refer to your agent's configuration file documentation: Agent Proxy settings C SDK -proxy at daemon startup Go transport Java Use proxy settings, including: proxy_host proxy_password proxy_port proxy_user .NET proxy element Node.js proxy PHP newrelic.daemon.proxy or the daemon's proxy setting Python proxy settings Ruby Use proxy settings, including: proxy_host proxy_port proxy_user proxy_pass",

      "body": "Application performance monitoring (APM) provides monitoring of your web or non-web application's performance. APM supports apps using several programming languages. Our APM agents give you real-time observability matched with trending data about your application's performance and the user experience. Agents reveal what is happening deep in your code with end to end transaction tracing and a variety of color-coded charts and reports. Identify problems before your users do Our APM agents report and store the state of your application so you can quickly identify potential problems before they affect your end users. With APM, your DevOps teams don't need to guess whether a performance blocker comes from the app itself, CPU availability, database loads, or something entirely unexpected. Use our APM solutions to gather both current and historical information about memory usage, CPU utilization, database query performance, web browser rendering performance, app availability, error analysis, external services, and other useful metrics. We have agents for Go, Java, .NET, Node.js, PHP, Python, and Ruby, as well as a C SDK. Monitor all aspects of your business Take advantage of these APM features, and more: Features Description App performance at a glance When you sign in to APM and select an app for your account, use the Summary page to quickly examine relationships across different aspects of your environment; for example: Web transactions response time: Where is the most time being spent? In the request queue, during different stages of page rendering and execution, from external services, or something else? Transaction traces: Which transactions are the slowest, and why? Error rate and throughput: What relationship is there between a spike in errors or slower throughput for a particular time period? Was there a deployment or outage at that time? Hosts: What kind of impact does this have on CPU usage, memory, etc.? Apdex: How are these events affecting customers' satisfaction with the site? Web and non-web transactions Start by comparing the top twenty web transactions or non-web transactions in terms of most time consuming, slowest average response time, highest throughput, or worst Apdex. From there, drill down into deeper trace levels for individual transactions, which in turn break down into smaller segments and components, from HTTPS requests on down to SQL queries. Want to explore even deeper? Set up distributed tracing to see how requests move across a distributed system. Select the transactions that are most important to your business (key transactions). APM and Infrastructure When your APM and Infrastructure accounts are linked, you will have access to APM data charts on these Infrastructure UI pages: Hosts, Network, Storage, and Processes. Distributed tracing Distributed tracing gives you visibility across distributed systems, showing you the path of a request as it travels between services. This feature is especially valuable for large, distributed systems that rely on many small services and microservices. Logs Bring your logs and APM agent data together to see logs associated with various objects in the New Relic UI such as applications, APM errors, APM traces, and Kubernetes containers. Service maps APM's service maps show your app's connections and dependencies, including databases and external services. Health indicators and performance metrics show you the current operational status for every part of your architecture. You can create and customize service maps to visualize and monitor your complex architectures. Query your data You can query and visualize your data: Sample and search APM transaction and error data to gain full understanding of the data being collected. Browse your data visually with the data explorer. Create custom SQL-like queries of your data using the New Relic Query Language (NRQL), or using our PromQL-style queries. Use dashboards to build advanced data visualizations, contextualize data, and understand what's going on in your system, real-time. These are just a few of APM's features. To find out more, see the table of contents for APM. Ready to get started? Start benefiting from APM in 5 simple steps (and just a few minutes!). Sign up for a New Relic account (it's free, forever!). Install and customize the language agent for your app. Generate some traffic for your app. Wait a few minutes for New Relic to start receiving your data. Log in to your account, and start exploring New Relic! Use the Explorer in New Relic One to access and observe the full stack of your software, including your apps, see performance data and alerting status at a glance, and check relationships. We provide you with a simple, yet powerful visual tool to monitor all your entities, that is, anything we can identify that reports data. In the New Relic ecosystem, entities include basic components like applications, hosts, containers, or database services, but it can also refer to custom groupings of such elements. You can also create your own entities. If data does not appear after waiting a few minutes, follow the troubleshooting tips for your APM agent.",

      "body": "Apdex T is the central value for Apdex. Apdex T is the response time above which a transaction is considered \"tolerable.\" You can define Apdex T values for each application, with separate values for app server and end-user browser performance. You can also define individual Apdex T thresholds for key transactions. Important You can only change Apdex thresholds for apps that are actively reporting data. For example, if one of your apps is not reporting, you won't see its Apdex setting options. App server Apdex settings The default Apdex T threshold for an application server is 0.5 seconds. To change the default application server threshold for web transactions: Go to one.newrelic.com > (select an app) > Settings > Application > Application settings. From the Application server section, set the Apdex T value (in seconds) for this application. Select Save application settings. After you change Apdex settings, a black vertical bar appears in the main chart on the APM Summary page. End-user (Browser) Apdex settings The default Apdex T threshold for browser monitoring is 7.0 seconds. To change the default end user threshold for Apdex T: Go to one.newrelic.com > Browser > (select an app) > Settings > Application settings. From the Settings page, set the end user Apdex T value (in seconds). Select Save application settings. Key transaction Apdex settings You can set custom Apdex values for your key transactions. These values are independent of the APM and browser Apdex values for the key transaction's parent application. Key transactions will contribute to the overall Apdex score based on their own Apdex T values. The default values are inherited from the parent application. Apdex alerting You can also configure alert conditions for Apdex. When the Apdex score passes the threshold you define, New Relic sends an alert to the notification mechanism (channel). Tip For Apdex scores, set Warning (yellow) conditions higher than Critical (red) conditions for Apdex scores. This will help you monitor your customers' experience before the Apdex level falls below an unsatisfactory level.",

      "body": "The APM agent that you installed receives data from your applications. The default data retention is based on your pricing edition. New Relic's default security settings automatically work to ensure data privacy and to limit the kind of information New Relic receives. You can also change these settings. Disclosure and audit Our APM agent is a publicly accessible plugin for web applications. The agent does not do any dynamic code generation while communicating with your app, so using the agent will not introduce any code into your application without your knowledge. Most of our agents are open source, so you can see what our code does: C SDK Go .NET Node.js Python Ruby Data collection Using a JSON message format, data the agent receives from your app is posted once a minute to the New Relic user interface. The website returns a JSON response to the agent, indicating if the data was correctly received or if there was an error. New Relic collects the following aggregate metric data: Database activity External web service calls Controller and dispatch activity View activity Uncaught exceptions and counts Process memory and CPU usage This aggregate metric data summarizes calls to specific methods in your application: how many times each one was called and various response time statistics (average, minimum, maximum, and standard deviation). In New Relic, you will see the class and method names along with their aggregate numbers. New Relic optionally collects: Data collection Comments Uncaught errors New Relic captures the error as well as a runtime stack trace of the offending code. Transaction traces These are snapshots of a single transaction. As an option, the agent can also collect the query statements called within the transaction. The default collection uses obfuscation to hide any strings or numbers from the query. For transactions slower than a threshold you set, New Relic also collects data from SQL EXPLAIN. For database calls slower than a configured threshold, New Relic optionally collects runtime stack traces, which are helpful to pinpoint where in the code a database call is made. Custom parameters You can add custom parameters to your application code and record them with transaction traces to provide additional context while you are examining profiling information. Optional: For both errors and transaction traces, the HTTP request parameters can also be recorded. Security settings If you want to restrict the information that New Relic receives, you can enable high security mode. If high security mode or the default settings do not work for your business needs, you can apply custom settings. Default security settings Depending on the agent, the default settings provide security for request parameters, HTTPS usage, and SQL: C SDK default security settings Go default security settings Java default security settings .NET default security settings Node.js default security settings PHP default security settings Python default security settings Ruby default security settings High security mode When the agent is in high security mode, default settings are locked so that users cannot change them. In addition, high security mode applies restrictions to custom events, custom instrumentation, user attributes, exception messages, or message queue parameters, depending on the agent: C SDK: n/a Go high security mode settings Java high security mode settings .NET high security mode settings Node.js high security mode settings PHP high security mode settings Python high security mode settings Ruby high security mode settings Custom security settings If you want custom security settings, you can customize the configuration file, change custom attribute settings, or use the API, depending on your agent: C SDK custom security settings Go custom security settings Java custom security settings .NET custom security mode settings Node.js custom security settings PHP custom security settings Python custom security settings Ruby custom security settings Data received by New Relic This information applies to all APM agents no matter what security settings you have applied. Important Other data that New Relic receives is specific to the security settings for each agent. Data Captured? APM agent language version OS type and version System properties Average response time of transactions in your app URL hits Client IP address Not captured TLS and SSL Our preferred protocol for all domains is TLS 1.2. APM agents enable SSL by default. To verify which release includes SSL by default and to ensure that you have the most up-to-date version, refer to your agent's release notes: C SDK Go Java .NET Node.js PHP Python Ruby The configuration file also includes an optional flag (ssl) to enable or disable SSL using HTTPS. New Relic does not do host authentication with HTTPS, just communication encryption. Exception: You cannot disable SSL for the C SDK. The C SDK daemon can only connect with SSL. New Relic requires HTTPS for all traffic to APM and the REST API. This includes both inbound and outbound traffic. If your REST API call uses HTTP, or if you have disabled SSL in your configuration file, change your script or program to HTTPS. Data transmission Under Java, .NET and PHP, New Relic uses JSON to serialize data. The Ruby agent uses either Ruby marshaling or JSON serialization to send data to New Relic, depending on whether a native JSON encoder is available in under the Ruby version the agent is running on. For required changes when you want to create firewall rules to allow the agent to communicate, see Networks. For more information about security measures for your data in transit to New Relic or at rest in our storage, see Data encryption. Proxies Optional settings are available so that you can configure the agent to communicate through a proxy. To define proxy settings for host, port, domain, user, or password, refer to your agent's configuration file documentation: Agent Proxy settings C SDK -proxy at daemon startup Go transport Java Use proxy settings, including: proxy_host proxy_password proxy_port proxy_user .NET proxy element Node.js proxy PHP newrelic.daemon.proxy or the daemon's proxy setting Python proxy settings Ruby Use proxy settings, including: proxy_host proxy_port proxy_user proxy_pass",

      "body": "Deploying an app can be a risky event—when your app breaks, a bad deployment is often the cause. New Relic allows you to track deployments so you can correlate deploy to your app's performance. Tracking deployments creates deployment markers that appear in APM charts. Options for tracking deployments You can use the New Relic REST API v2 to record new deployments, retrieve a list of past deployments, and delete past deployments on your APM application. In addition, some APM agents have agent-specific methods to record deployments automatically. You can use your Slack integration with New Relic, or a simple webhook, to notify your team in real time of deployments for applications monitored by APM. Slack provides a webhook URL that allows you to post generic JSON that will appear formatted in a chosen Slack channel. There are a few places where you can view deployments in the New Relic UI after they have been recorded. You can view deployments in the UI: In the activity feed of the APM Summary, New Relic One Service summary, and entity summary pages. On APM performance charts as a chart marker. On the Deployments page for summary performance. Tip Deployment markers are not available for browser applications, but see browser releases for a way to tag errors with release versions. Record deployments with the REST API You can use the New Relic REST API v2 to record deployments, get a list of past deployments, and delete deployments. The examples in this document use curl as a command line tool. However, you can use any method to make your REST requests. You can also create, view, and delete deployments with the API Explorer. JSON uses double quotes \" for element names and content. Using single quotes ' will cause errors. Record a deployment with POST To record a new deployment, send a POST request that includes your API key to the deployments endpoint. Attach the payload in JSON format (see Character limits and JSON parameters). All payload parameters are optional except revision. For example: curl -X POST \"https://api.newrelic.com/v2/applications/$APP_ID/deployments.json\" \\ -H \"Api-Key:$API_KEY\" \\ -i \\ -H \"Content-Type: application/json\" \\ -d \\ '{ \"deployment\": { \"revision\": \"REVISION\", \"changelog\": \"Added: /v2/deployments.rb, Removed: None\", \"description\": \"Added a deployments resource to the v2 API\", \"user\": \"datanerd@example.com\", \"timestamp\": \"2019-10-08T00:15:36Z\" } }' Copy Record a deployment with PowerShell To record a deployment with PowerShell, send a POST request that includes your API key to the deployments endpoint. Attach the payload in JSON format (see Character limits and JSON parameters). All payload parameters are optional except revision. This example uses PowerShell version 3 or higher: Invoke-WebRequest -Uri https://api.newrelic.com/v2/applications/YOUR_APP_ID/deployments.json -Method POST -Headers @{'Api-Key'='$API_KEY'} -ContentType 'application/json' -Body '{ \"deployment\": { \"revision\": \"REVISION\", \"changelog\": \"Added: /v2/deployments.rb, Removed: None\", \"description\": \"Added a deployments resource to the v2 API\", \"user\": \"datanerd@example.com\", \"timestamp\": \"2019-10-08T00:15:36Z\" } }' Copy This example uses PowerShell version 2 (requires .NET framework 3.5 or higher): $encoding = [System.Text.Encoding]::GetEncoding(\"ASCII\") $data ='{ \"deployment\": { \"revision\": \"REVISION\", \"changelog\": \"Added: /v2/deployments.rb, Removed: None\", \"description\": \"Added a deployments resource to the v2 API\", \"user\": \"datanerd@example.com\", \"timestamp\": \"2019-10-08T00:15:36Z\" } }' $postData = $encoding.GetBytes($data) $request = [System.Net.WebRequest]::Create('https://api.newrelic.com/v2/applications/$APP_ID/deployments.json') $request.Method = 'POST' $request.Headers.add('Api-Key','$API_KEY') $request.ContentType='application/json' $stream = $request.GetRequestStream() $stream.Write($postData,0,$postData.Length) $request.GetResponse() Copy View a list of deployments with GET To retrieve a list of all past deployments for your app, send a GET request that includes your API key to the deployments endpoint. GET requests do not use a JSON payload. For example: curl -X GET \"https://api.newrelic.com/v2/applications/$APP_ID/deployments.json\" \\ -H \"Api-Key:$API_KEY\" \\ -i Copy Sample output from GET This example requests a list of deployments for app ID 9999999: curl -X GET \"https://api.newrelic.com/v2/applications/9999999/deployments.json\" \\ -H \"Api-Key:ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXabcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwx\" \\ -i Copy The API returns this list of deployments: HTTP/1.1 200 OK ETag: \"ABCDEFGHIJKabcdefghijk0123456789\" Cache-Control: max-age=0, private, must-revalidate Content-Type: application/json { \"deployments\": [ { \"id\": 1234567, \"revision\": \"1234123412341234123412341234123412341234\", \"changelog\": \"Fixed the bugs for real this time\", \"description\": \"Example description two\", \"user\": \"Data Nerd\", \"timestamp\": \"2016-02-24T10:09:27-08:00\", \"links\": { \"application\": 9999999 } }, { \"id\": 2345678, \"revision\": \"7890789078907890789078907890789078907890\", \"changelog\": \"Think I fixed all the bugs\", \"description\": null, \"user\": \"Dren Atad\", \"timestamp\": \"2014-10-22T12:23:47-07:00\", \"links\": { \"application\": 9999999 } } ], \"links\": { \"deployment.agent\": \"/v2/applications/{application_id}\" } } Copy Delete a deployment with DELETE To delete a deployment, send a DELETE request that includes your API key to the deployments endpoint. DELETE requests do not use a JSON payload, but you must specify the ID for the deployment you want to delete. To retrieve the ID for a deployment, use the GET request. For example: curl -X DELETE \"https://api.newrelic.com/v2/applications/$APP_ID/deployments/$DEPLOYMENT_ID.json\" \\ -H \"Api-Key:$API_KEY\" \\ -i Copy Character limits and JSON parameters The JSON payload can include the following parameters. Important UTF-8 4 byte characters, such as Emojis and some non-Latin language glyphs, cannot be used in the deployment text. Parameter Data type Description revision String, 127 character maximum Required. A unique ID for this deployment, visible in the Summary page and on the Deployments page. Can be any string, but is usually a version number or a Git checksum. changelog String, 65535 character maximum Optional. A summary of what changed in this deployment, visible in the Deployments page when you select (selected deployment) > Change log. description String, 65535 character maximum Optional. A high-level description of this deployment, visible in the Summary page and on the Deployments page when you select an individual deployment. user String, 31 character maximum Optional. A username to associate with the deployment, visible in the Summary page and on the Deployments page. timestamp ISO 8601 Optional. When the deployment occurred, down to the second. If not specified, the deployment will be recorded at the time when the API call was received. Timestamp requirements: Must be in UTC time. Must be after the most recent deployment timestamp. Cannot be in the future. Must be in ISO8601 format; for example, \"2019-10-08T00:15:36Z\". Record deployments using the New Relic agent Some agents have additional methods to record deployments: All agents: Use the New Relic REST API v2. C: No SDK-specific methods. Use the REST API. Go: No agent-specific methods. Use the REST API. Java: Call the Java agent jar. .NET: Use PowerShell and the REST API. Node.js: No agent-specific methods. Use the REST API. PHP: Use a PHP script. Python: Use the record-deploy subcommand of the newrelic-admin script. Ruby: Use a Capistrano recipe. Notify your team of deployments After a deployment is recorded using the REST API, you can optionally notify a webhook endpoint of the deployment. The destination of the webhook can be your Slack instance. To use webhooks to set up a deployment notification for a Slack channel: Log in to your Slack account as an admin, then go to App directory > Manage > Apps. Search for your New Relic app, then select Add configuration. From Post to channel, select an existing Slack channel or add a new channel, then Add configuration. From the list of options, copy the webhook URL. Go to one.newrelic.com > (account dropdown) > Account settings > Integrations > Deploy notifications > Webhook. Paste the Slack webhook URL, then save. Optional: Send a test message. Tip You can also use webhooks, Slack channels, and other options for alert notifications with New Relic Alerts. End of life notification: Hipchat, Campfire As of September 9, 2019, integrations with Hipchat and Campfire for APM deployment notifications will no longer be available. Recommendation: If you are still using Hipchat or Campfire, use webhooks with Slack channels instead. For more information, see the New Relic Explorers Hub post.",

      "body": "Applications are automatically removed from New Relic after 93 days without sending data to our platform. You can also remove an application using the UI, once it has stopped sending data. Key metrics will continue to be available via the New Relic REST API, with the application name remaining reserved. For more information, see Inactive apps in New Relic One and our data retention guidelines. Before attempting to remove an app Before attempting to remove an APM, browser, or mobile app from the New Relic UI, keep in mind: You can downgrade your account to pay less or make it entirely free. To remove an app, you must have a user role with that capability. If an agent is still sending data from an app, you cannot remove an app. Remove an application from New Relic Before removing an APM, browser, or mobile application from New Relic, stop the application from sending data either by disabling the agent or by uninstalling it completely. APM applications Disable the APM agent: C SDK: Do a quick recompile and deploy. For example, surround your instrumentation in #ifdef, and set the value of YOURNAMESPACE_NEWRELIC_ENABLED with your build system. Go: Set Enabled to false. Java: Set agent_enabled to false. .NET: Set Newrelic.AgentEnabled to false. Node.js: Set agent_enabled to false. PHP: Remove or disable both the newrelic.so and newrelic-daemon components. Set newrelic.enabled to false. Python: Set monitor_mode to false. Ruby: Set agent_enabled to false. Restart the application server and wait up to ten minutes. Verify the color-coded health status for the app has turned to gray and is no longer reporting data. To remove the APM application and any browser applications linked to it, you have two options: Click the Delete application button on the APM application/service's Settings page. Go to one.newrelic.com > APM > (select an app/service) > Settings > Application. Or, call the /applications/delete endpoint of the New Relic REST API. For example: curl -X DELETE 'https://api.newrelic.com/v2/applications/YOUR_APP_ID.json' \\ -H 'X-Api-Key:YOUR_API_KEY' -i Copy Browser If you've used the copy/paste method to install the browser agent, remove the JavaScript snippet from your application's pages. After 93 days, the application will be removed from New Relic. Tip If browser data continues to be reported, see our suggestions below. Once your browser application has stopped reporting, you have two ways to remove it: If your browser application is linked to an APM application, deleting the APM application also removes the browser application. See the instructions for deleting an APM application/service above for details. Or, click the Delete application button on the browser application's Application settings page. Go to one.newrelic.com > Browser > (select an app) > Settings > Application settings . Mobile Remove all references/dependencies to the New Relic's mobile SDK/frameworks, then rebuild the application. For more information, see the iOS and Android install docs. After 93 days, the application will be removed from New Relic. Or, once your mobile application has stopped reporting, you can also remove it manually: Click the Delete application button on the mobile application's Settings page. Go to one.newrelic.com > Mobile > (select an app) > Settings > Application . Troubleshooting If you have problems removing an app, here are some possible causes and suggested solutions: You are not an admin on your full user account If you don't have proper permissions, you won't be able to remove an application. You have not waited long enough All app data must stop reporting to New Relic before you can remove that entity from New Relic. In most cases, this takes between 10-15 minutes. In rare cases, it can take a few minutes longer. Not all agents are disabled If you have multiple agents reporting data under the same UI name, then you must make sure you disable or uninstall all of the agents associated with that entity. You have problems removing your PHP app If you have a PHP app and aren't able to remove it from the UI, possible causes include: You have not disabled both components of the PHP agent. You must stop or uninstall both newrelic.so and newrelic-daemon in order to be able to remove a PHP app. For more information, see New Relic daemon processes. You have set up per-directory monitoring of your PHP app, and unexpected PHP data is reporting as the default PHP application in the New Relic UI. To fix this, change the default app name in the PHP agent config. You don't know where the app's data is coming from If you don't know where an app's data is coming from, it may be because the app's name has been changed. When an app name is changed in the UI, it does not change the underlying app name being reported; it only changes how the app name appears in the UI. To see if there is a difference between the reported name and the displayed name: From one.newrelic.com, select APM, then select an application. Scroll down to Settings and select Application. Compare the name in the Application alias field to the name in the Your application still reports as message directly beneath it. To get host information about an app you are not familiar with: From one.newrelic.com, select APM, then select an application. From the summary view, review the Servers list. Once you have identified where app data is coming from, you can remove the app from New Relic. Browser data is still reporting To remove an app from New Relic, all data must have stopped reporting, including browser monitoring data. To verify that you have disabled or uninstalled the APM agent associated with the app: Ensure that browser monitoring is disabled. If your browser monitoring script is inserted by the APM agent, turn it off from inside the UI, in the agent's config file, or in both. If you copied and pasted the monitoring JavaScript snippet in certain pages, remove that JavaScript snippet manually. Ensure all caches have been cleared that the application uses, such as host caches, CDNs, or anything else that caches built pages. Optional: To see a count of how many page views report from each domain, use this NRQL query: SELECT count(*) FROM PageView WHERE appName = 'YOUR_BROWSER_APP_NAME' FACET domain Copy If these steps don't resolve the issue, it is likely due to an end-user's browser cache that hasn't yet cleared. Wait until those caches clear. If your app has internal users, you may be able to identify the users and clear those caches. For more help",

      "body": "Applications are automatically removed from New Relic after 93 days without sending data to our platform. You can also remove an application using the UI, once it has stopped sending data. Key metrics will continue to be available via the New Relic REST API, with the application name remaining reserved. For more information, see Inactive apps in New Relic One and our data retention guidelines. Before attempting to remove an app Before attempting to remove an APM, browser, or mobile app from the New Relic UI, keep in mind: You can downgrade your account to pay less or make it entirely free. To remove an app, you must have a user role with that capability. If an agent is still sending data from an app, you cannot remove an app. Remove an application from New Relic Before removing an APM, browser, or mobile application from New Relic, stop the application from sending data either by disabling the agent or by uninstalling it completely. APM applications Disable the APM agent: C SDK: Do a quick recompile and deploy. For example, surround your instrumentation in #ifdef, and set the value of YOURNAMESPACE_NEWRELIC_ENABLED with your build system. Go: Set Enabled to false. Java: Set agent_enabled to false. .NET: Set Newrelic.AgentEnabled to false. Node.js: Set agent_enabled to false. PHP: Remove or disable both the newrelic.so and newrelic-daemon components. Set newrelic.enabled to false. Python: Set monitor_mode to false. Ruby: Set agent_enabled to false. Restart the application server and wait up to ten minutes. Verify the color-coded health status for the app has turned to gray and is no longer reporting data. To remove the APM application and any browser applications linked to it, you have two options: Click the Delete application button on the APM application/service's Settings page. Go to one.newrelic.com > APM > (select an app/service) > Settings > Application. Or, call the /applications/delete endpoint of the New Relic REST API. For example: curl -X DELETE 'https://api.newrelic.com/v2/applications/YOUR_APP_ID.json' \\ -H 'X-Api-Key:YOUR_API_KEY' -i Copy Browser If you've used the copy/paste method to install the browser agent, remove the JavaScript snippet from your application's pages. After 93 days, the application will be removed from New Relic. Tip If browser data continues to be reported, see our suggestions below. Once your browser application has stopped reporting, you have two ways to remove it: If your browser application is linked to an APM application, deleting the APM application also removes the browser application. See the instructions for deleting an APM application/service above for details. Or, click the Delete application button on the browser application's Application settings page. Go to one.newrelic.com > Browser > (select an app) > Settings > Application settings . Mobile Remove all references/dependencies to the New Relic's mobile SDK/frameworks, then rebuild the application. For more information, see the iOS and Android install docs. After 93 days, the application will be removed from New Relic. Or, once your mobile application has stopped reporting, you can also remove it manually: Click the Delete application button on the mobile application's Settings page. Go to one.newrelic.com > Mobile > (select an app) > Settings > Application . Troubleshooting If you have problems removing an app, here are some possible causes and suggested solutions: You are not an admin on your full user account If you don't have proper permissions, you won't be able to remove an application. You have not waited long enough All app data must stop reporting to New Relic before you can remove that entity from New Relic. In most cases, this takes between 10-15 minutes. In rare cases, it can take a few minutes longer. Not all agents are disabled If you have multiple agents reporting data under the same UI name, then you must make sure you disable or uninstall all of the agents associated with that entity. You have problems removing your PHP app If you have a PHP app and aren't able to remove it from the UI, possible causes include: You have not disabled both components of the PHP agent. You must stop or uninstall both newrelic.so and newrelic-daemon in order to be able to remove a PHP app. For more information, see New Relic daemon processes. You have set up per-directory monitoring of your PHP app, and unexpected PHP data is reporting as the default PHP application in the New Relic UI. To fix this, change the default app name in the PHP agent config. You don't know where the app's data is coming from If you don't know where an app's data is coming from, it may be because the app's name has been changed. When an app name is changed in the UI, it does not change the underlying app name being reported; it only changes how the app name appears in the UI. To see if there is a difference between the reported name and the displayed name: From one.newrelic.com, select APM, then select an application. Scroll down to Settings and select Application.

      "body": "You may want to temporarily disable an APM agent for the purposes of testing or troubleshooting. This document explains procedures for temporarily turning off the APM agent. Related procedures: To permanently disable APM, uninstall the agent. To configure an agent to monitor some things but not others, use custom instrumentation. Disable the APM agent Select your agent type for instructions: C SDK The C SDK cannot be turned on or off directly. However, you can write your code for the SDK so that a quick recompile and deploy can enable or disable your instrumentation. Follow standard procedures to disable or uninstall the C SDK. Go There are two main ways to disable the Go agent: Remove the import of the github.com/newrelic/go-agent package from your application, and remove or comment out any calls to the newrelic namespace. Then, recompile and restart your app. Use the enabled configuration setting. Then, recompile and restart your app. (This will not reduce overhead because the instrumentation is still running; it will only prevent the sending of data to the New Relic collector.) Tip After you disable the agent, it may take several minutes for data to stop showing up. Java There are three main ways to disable the Java agent: Set agent_enabled to false, then restart the JVM. Use the JVM command line flag: -Dnewrelic.config.agent_enabled=false Copy Then restart the JVM. Remove the newrelic.jar or newrelic.yml file, then restart the JVM. Tip After you disable the agent, it may take several minutes for data to stop showing up. .NET The method to disable the agent depends on if you are using Framework or Core: .NET Framework: Set agentEnabled to false in the global newrelic.config file, found in C:\\ProgramData\\New Relic\\.NET Agent\\. If the application is IIS-hosted, restart IIS. If it's self-hosted (non-IIS), restart the application. .NET Core: Set agentEnabled to false in the newrelic.config file found in the Core agent’s installation directory (for Windows alongside NewRelic.Profiler.dll and for Linux alongside NewRelic.Profiler.so). If you use the ASP.NET Core Module, reset IIS. Otherwise, restart your Core application. Tip After you disable the agent, it may take several minutes for data to stop showing up. Node.js There are two main ways to disable the Node.js agent: Set agent_enabled to false in your agent config file, then restart the app server. Set the NEW_RELIC_ENABLED environment variable to false. Tip After you disable the agent, it may take several minutes for data to stop showing up. PHP To disable the PHP agent, set the enabled config setting to false, then restart the web server or PHP. Tip After you disable the agent, it may take several minutes for data to stop showing up. Python There are three main ways to disable the Python agent, depending on your preference and setup: Standard install: Use the monitor_mode configuration setting. This can be done by editing the config file or by using an environment variable. Standard install with newrelic-admin script: Remove reference to that script in your application. Manual instrumentation: Remove the initialization script from your application. Tip After you disable the agent, it may take several minutes for data to stop showing up. Ruby There are several ways to disable the Ruby agent, depending on your preference and setup. These methods will remove most instrumentation but there will still be a small amount of activity and overhead: Use the agent_enabled configuration setting. This can be done in the configuration file or in the per-environment stanzas. Restart your app server afterward. Do the same via an environment variable, then restart the app server. The following methods will remove all instrumentation and overhead: Remove newrelic_rpm from the Gemfile and bundle install. Set the following in the Gemfile and bundle install: gem 'newrelic_rpm', :require => false Copy This option ensures the gem is installed if it's required somewhere in the app, but doesn't install it when bundling.

New Relic allows you to track deployments so you can correlate deploy to your app's performance. Tracking deployments creates deployment markers that appear in APM charts. Options for tracking deployments You can use the New Relic REST API v2 to record new deployments, retrieve a list of past deployments, and delete past deployments on your APM application. In addition, some APM agents have agent-specific methods to record deployments automatically. You can use your Slack integration with New Relic, or a simple webhook, to notify your team in real time of deployments for applications monitored by APM. Slack provides a webhook URL that allows you to post generic JSON that will appear formatted in a chosen Slack channel. There are a few places where you can view deployments in the New Relic UI after they have been recorded. You can view deployments in the UI: In the activity feed of the APM Summary, New Relic One Service summary, and entity summary pages. On APM performance charts as a chart marker. On the Deployments page for summary performance. Tip Deployment markers are not available for browser applications, but see browser releases for a way to tag errors with release versions. Record deployments with the REST API You can use the New Relic REST API v2 to record deployments, get a list of past deployments, and delete deployments. The examples in this document use curl as a command line tool. However, you can use any method to make your REST requests. You can also create, view, and delete deployments with the API Explorer. JSON uses double quotes \" for element names and content. Using single quotes ' will cause errors. Record a deployment with POST To record a new deployment, send a POST request that includes your API key to the deployments endpoint. Attach the payload in JSON format (see Character limits and JSON parameters). All payload parameters are optional except revision. For example: curl -X POST \"https://api.newrelic.com/v2/applications/$APP_ID/deployments.json\" \\ -H \"Api-Key:$API_KEY\" \\ -i \\ -H \"Content-Type: application/json\" \\ -d \\ '{ \"deployment\": { \"revision\": \"REVISION\", \"changelog\": \"Added: /v2/deployments.rb, Removed: None\", \"description\": \"Added a deployments resource to the v2 API\", \"user\": \"datanerd@example.com\", \"timestamp\": \"2019-10-08T00:15:36Z\" } }' Copy Record a deployment with PowerShell To record a deployment with PowerShell, send a POST request that includes your API key to the deployments endpoint. Attach the payload in JSON format (see Character limits and JSON parameters). All payload parameters are optional except revision. This example uses PowerShell version 3 or higher: Invoke-WebRequest -Uri https://api.newrelic.com/v2/applications/YOUR_APP_ID/deployments.json -Method POST -Headers @{'Api-Key'='$API_KEY'} -ContentType 'application/json' -Body '{ \"deployment\": { \"revision\": \"REVISION\", \"changelog\": \"Added: /v2/deployments.rb, Removed: None\", \"description\": \"Added a deployments resource to the v2 API\", \"user\": \"datanerd@example.com\", \"timestamp\": \"2019-10-08T00:15:36Z\" } }' Copy This example uses PowerShell version 2 (requires .NET framework 3.5 or higher): $encoding = [System.Text.Encoding]::GetEncoding(\"ASCII\") $data ='{ \"deployment\": { \"revision\": \"REVISION\", \"changelog\": \"Added: /v2/deployments.rb, Removed: None\", \"description\": \"Added a deployments resource to the v2 API\", \"user\": \"datanerd@example.com\", \"timestamp\": \"2019-10-08T00:15:36Z\" } }' $postData = $encoding.GetBytes($data) $request = [System.Net.WebRequest]::Create('https://api.newrelic.com/v2/applications/$APP_ID/deployments.json') $request.Method = 'POST' $request.Headers.add('Api-Key','$API_KEY') $request.ContentType='application/json' $stream = $request.GetRequestStream() $stream.Write($postData,0,$postData.Length) $request.GetResponse() Copy View a list of deployments with GET To retrieve a list of all past deployments for your app, send a GET request that includes your API key to the deployments endpoint. GET requests do not use a JSON payload. For example: curl -X GET \"https://api.newrelic.com/v2/applications/$APP_ID/deployments.json\" \\ -H \"Api-Key:$API_KEY\" \\ -i Copy Sample output from GET This example requests a list of deployments for app ID 9999999: curl -X GET \"https://api.newrelic.com/v2/applications/9999999/deployments.json\" \\ -H \"Api-Key:ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXabcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwx\" \\ -i Copy The API returns this list of deployments: HTTP/1.1 200 OK ETag: \"ABCDEFGHIJKabcdefghijk0123456789\" Cache-Control: max-age=0, private, must-revalidate Content-Type: application/json { \"deployments\": [ { \"id\": 1234567, \"revision\": \"1234123412341234123412341234123412341234\", \"changelog\": \"Fixed the bugs for real this time\", \"description\": \"Example description two\", \"user\": \"Data Nerd\", \"timestamp\": \"2016-02-24T10:09:27-08:00\", \"links\": { \"application\": 9999999 } }, { \"id\": 2345678, \"revision\": \"7890789078907890789078907890789078907890\", \"changelog\": \"Think I fixed all the bugs\", \"description\": null, \"user\": \"Dren Atad\", \"timestamp\": \"2014-10-22T12:23:47-07:00\", \"links\": { \"application\": 9999999 } } ], \"links\": { \"deployment.agent\": \"/v2/applications/{application_id}\" } } Copy Delete a deployment with DELETE To delete a deployment, send a DELETE request that includes your API key to the deployments endpoint. DELETE requests do not use a JSON payload, but you must specify the ID for the deployment you want to delete. To retrieve the ID for a deployment, use the GET request. For example: curl -X DELETE \"https://api.newrelic.com/v2/applications/$APP_ID/deployments/$DEPLOYMENT_ID.json\" \\ -H \"Api-Key:$API_KEY\" \\ -i Copy Character limits and JSON parameters The JSON payload can include the following parameters. Important UTF-8 4 byte characters, such as Emojis and some non-Latin language glyphs, cannot be used in the deployment text. Parameter Data type Description revision String, 127 character maximum Required. A unique ID for this deployment, visible in the Summary page and on the Deployments page. Can be any string, but is usually a version number or a Git checksum. changelog String, 65535 character maximum Optional. A summary of what changed in this deployment, visible in the Deployments page when you select (selected deployment) > Change log. description String, 65535 character maximum Optional. A high-level description of this deployment, visible in the Summary page and on the Deployments page when you select an individual deployment. user String, 31 character maximum Optional. A username to associate with the deployment, visible in the Summary page and on the Deployments page. timestamp ISO 8601 Optional. When the deployment occurred, down to the second. If not specified, the deployment will be recorded at the time when the API call was received. Timestamp requirements: Must be in UTC time. Must be after the most recent deployment timestamp. Cannot be in the future. Must be in ISO8601 format; for example, \"2019-10-08T00:15:36Z\". Record deployments using the New Relic agent Some agents have additional methods to record deployments: All agents: Use the New Relic REST API v2. C: No SDK-specific methods. Use the REST API. Go: No agent-specific methods. Use the REST API. Java: Call the Java agent jar. .NET: Use PowerShell and the REST API. Node.js: No agent-specific methods. Use the REST API. PHP: Use a PHP script. Python: Use the record-deploy subcommand of the newrelic-admin script. Ruby: Use a Capistrano recipe. Notify your team of deployments After a deployment is recorded using the REST API, you can optionally notify a webhook endpoint of the deployment. The destination of the webhook can be your Slack instance. To use webhooks to set up a deployment notification for a Slack channel: Log in to your Slack account as an admin, then go to App directory > Manage > Apps. Search for your New Relic app, then select Add configuration. From Post to channel, select an existing Slack channel or add a new channel, then Add configuration. From the list of options, copy the webhook URL. Go to one.newrelic.com > (account dropdown) > Account settings > Integrations > Deploy notifications > Webhook. Paste the Slack webhook URL, then save. Optional: Send a test message. Tip You can also use webhooks, Slack channels, and other options for alert notifications with New Relic Alerts. End of life notification: Hipchat, Campfire As of September 9, 2019, integrations with Hipchat and Campfire for APM deployment notifications will no longer be available. Recommendation: If you are still using Hipchat or Campfire, use webhooks with Slack channels instead. For more information, see the New Relic Explorers Hub post.",

      "body": "You may want to temporarily disable an APM agent for the purposes of testing or troubleshooting. This document explains procedures for temporarily turning off the APM agent. Related procedures: To permanently disable APM, uninstall the agent. To configure an agent to monitor some things but not others, use custom instrumentation. Disable the APM agent Select your agent type for instructions: C SDK The C SDK cannot be turned on or off directly. However, you can write your code for the SDK so that a quick recompile and deploy can enable or disable your instrumentation. Follow standard procedures to disable or uninstall the C SDK. Go There are two main ways to disable the Go agent: Remove the import of the github.com/newrelic/go-agent package from your application, and remove or comment out any calls to the newrelic namespace. Then, recompile and restart your app. Use the enabled configuration setting. Then, recompile and restart your app. (This will not reduce overhead because the instrumentation is still running; it will only prevent the sending of data to the New Relic collector.) Tip After you disable the agent, it may take several minutes for data to stop showing up. Java There are three main ways to disable the Java agent: Set agent_enabled to false, then restart the JVM. Use the JVM command line flag: -Dnewrelic.config.agent_enabled=false Copy Then restart the JVM. Remove the newrelic.jar or newrelic.yml file, then restart the JVM. Tip After you disable the agent, it may take several minutes for data to stop showing up. .NET The method to disable the agent depends on if you are using Framework or Core: .NET Framework: Set agentEnabled to false in the global newrelic.config file, found in C:\\ProgramData\\New Relic\\.NET Agent\\. If the application is IIS-hosted, restart IIS. If it's self-hosted (non-IIS), restart the application. .NET Core: Set agentEnabled to false in the newrelic.config file found in the Core agent’s installation directory (for Windows alongside NewRelic.Profiler.dll and for Linux alongside NewRelic.Profiler.so). If you use the ASP.NET Core Module, reset IIS. Otherwise, restart your Core application. Tip After you disable the agent, it may take several minutes for data to stop showing up. Node.js There are two main ways to disable the Node.js agent: Set agent_enabled to false in your agent config file, then restart the app server. Set the NEW_RELIC_ENABLED environment variable to false. Tip After you disable the agent, it may take several minutes for data to stop showing up. PHP To disable the PHP agent, set the enabled config setting to false, then restart the web server or PHP. Tip After you disable the agent, it may take several minutes for data to stop showing up. Python There are three main ways to disable the Python agent, depending on your preference and setup: Standard install: Use the monitor_mode configuration setting. This can be done by editing the config file or by using an environment variable. Standard install with newrelic-admin script: Remove reference to that script in your application. Manual instrumentation: Remove the initialization script from your application. Tip After you disable the agent, it may take several minutes for data to stop showing up. Ruby There are several ways to disable the Ruby agent, depending on your preference and setup. These methods will remove most instrumentation but there will still be a small amount of activity and overhead: Use the agent_enabled configuration setting. This can be done in the configuration file or in the per-environment stanzas. Restart your app server afterward. Do the same via an environment variable, then restart the app server. The following methods will remove all instrumentation and overhead: Remove newrelic_rpm from the Gemfile and bundle install. Set the following in the Gemfile and bundle install: gem 'newrelic_rpm', :require => false Copy This option ensures the gem is installed if it's required somewhere in the app, but doesn't install it when bundling.

      "body": "Application performance monitoring (APM) provides monitoring of your web or non-web application's performance. APM supports apps using several programming languages. Our APM agents give you real-time observability matched with trending data about your application's performance and the user experience. Agents reveal what is happening deep in your code with end to end transaction tracing and a variety of color-coded charts and reports. Identify problems before your users do Our APM agents report and store the state of your application so you can quickly identify potential problems before they affect your end users. With APM, your DevOps teams don't need to guess whether a performance blocker comes from the app itself, CPU availability, database loads, or something entirely unexpected. Use our APM solutions to gather both current and historical information about memory usage, CPU utilization, database query performance, web browser rendering performance, app availability, error analysis, external services, and other useful metrics. We have agents for Go, Java, .NET, Node.js, PHP, Python, and Ruby, as well as a C SDK. Monitor all aspects of your business Take advantage of these APM features, and more: Features Description App performance at a glance When you sign in to APM and select an app for your account, use the Summary page to quickly examine relationships across different aspects of your environment; for example: Web transactions response time: Where is the most time being spent? In the request queue, during different stages of page rendering and execution, from external services, or something else? Transaction traces: Which transactions are the slowest, and why? Error rate and throughput: What relationship is there between a spike in errors or slower throughput for a particular time period? Was there a deployment or outage at that time? Hosts: What kind of impact does this have on CPU usage, memory, etc.? Apdex: How are these events affecting customers' satisfaction with the site? Web and non-web transactions Start by comparing the top twenty web transactions or non-web transactions in terms of most time consuming, slowest average response time, highest throughput, or worst Apdex. From there, drill down into deeper trace levels for individual transactions, which in turn break down into smaller segments and components, from HTTPS requests on down to SQL queries. Want to explore even deeper? Set up distributed tracing to see how requests move across a distributed system. Select the transactions that are most important to your business (key transactions). APM and Infrastructure When your APM and Infrastructure accounts are linked, you will have access to APM data charts on these Infrastructure UI pages: Hosts, Network, Storage, and Processes. Distributed tracing Distributed tracing gives you visibility across distributed systems, showing you the path of a request as it travels between services. This feature is especially valuable for large, distributed systems that rely on many small services and microservices. Logs Bring your logs and APM agent data together to see logs associated with various objects in the New Relic UI such as applications, APM errors, APM traces, and Kubernetes containers. Service maps APM's service maps show your app's connections and dependencies, including databases and external services. Health indicators and performance metrics show you the current operational status for every part of your architecture. You can create and customize service maps to visualize and monitor your complex architectures. Query your data You can query and visualize your data: Sample and search APM transaction and error data to gain full understanding of the data being collected. Browse your data visually with the data explorer. Create custom SQL-like queries of your data using the New Relic Query Language (NRQL), or using our PromQL-style queries. Use dashboards to build advanced data visualizations, contextualize data, and understand what's going on in your system, real-time. These are just a few of APM's features. To find out more, see the table of contents for APM. Ready to get started? Start benefiting from APM in 5 simple steps (and just a few minutes!). Sign up for a New Relic account (it's free, forever!). Install and customize the language agent for your app. Generate some traffic for your app. Wait a few minutes for New Relic to start receiving your data. Log in to your account, and start exploring New Relic! Use the Explorer in New Relic One to access and observe the full stack of your software, including your apps, see performance data and alerting status at a glance, and check relationships. We provide you with a simple, yet powerful visual tool to monitor all your entities, that is, anything we can identify that reports data. In the New Relic ecosystem, entities include basic components like applications, hosts, containers, or database services, but it can also refer to custom groupings of such elements. You can also create your own entities. If data does not appear after waiting a few minutes, follow the troubleshooting tips for your APM agent.",

      "body": "Our APM agents and mobile agents have limits on the number of events that can be reported. This document explains: Why event-reporting limits are necessary How sampling works How to work with and understand sampled data Difference between events and metrics This document is about limits on event data and how those limits lead to sampling. First, it may help you to understand the differences between these two types of data: Metrics: aggregated measurements over time. Examples: average response time over a one-minute time range, throughput over time, CPU utilization over time. Events: discrete events that happen at a specific moment in time. Examples: a log or error being reported, or a configuration change. Some events are aggregated over time to form metrics (for example: a count of errors over time). These two types of data have different uses: metrics are useful for recognizing patterns over time in your system, and events are useful for drilling down and getting detail about the causes of those patterns. Because metrics are aggregated over time, they’re useful for spotting trends and changes in system behavior. For metrics that represent an aggregated count of events (like an HTTP response time metric), the individual events give you granular detail about what happened, and let you facet by attributes that have high cardinality (like account or user ID). Why sampling of events is necessary Our APM agents and mobile agents have limits on how many events can be reported per harvest cycle. This is necessary because if there were no limit, a very large number of events being sent could have performance impacts on your application or on New Relic. When the limit is reached, the agents begin sampling events. Different agents have different limits, but the goal is to give a representative sample from across the harvest cycle. Also, agents may sample if they can't connect to New Relic. When an agent can’t connect to New Relic, it continues to store data locally. But it must restrict the size of the payload that is eventually sent. For this reason, it samples events during the disconnected period. The longer it is disconnected, the more it will sample. The impact of sampling One result of sampling is that there can be a discrepancy between unsampled metric data and sampled event data. Examples of this: An APM chart showing unsampled metric data may show you higher throughput than an equivalent NRQL query of sampled event data. For more about the difference between our metric timeslice data and event data, see Data types. A non-New Relic monitoring service may show different results from New Relic. Events that are capped and subject to sampling include: Transaction TransactionError Span (see Distributed tracing sampling) Custom events reported via agent API (example: the .NET agent's RecordCustomEvent) Mobile MobileRequest MobileCrash MobileHandledException Important For APM, you can compensate for sampling when querying data. Change how sampling occurs Before attempting to change how sampling occurs, please read these caveats and recommendations: Reporting more events will result in the agent using more memory. There will usually be a way for you to get the data you need without raising an agent's event-reporting limit. The payload size limit is 1MB (10^6 bytes) (compressed), so the number of events may still be affected by that limit. To determine if events are being dropped, see the agent log for a 413 HTTP status message. Here are some ways to impact sampling: Most agents have configuration options for changing the limit on sampled transactions (examples: Java agent’s max_samples_stored or the Android mobile agent’s setMaxEventPoolSize). If it’s important to you that a specific app activity not be sampled, you can use the Event API. You could deploy your application across a greater number of instances. Because the limits are per-agent, more agents will mean a larger event reservoir. APM: Compensate for sampling When querying APM-reported events, you can compensate for sampling by using EXTRAPOLATE. This will give you an approximation of what unsampled data looks like.",

Agents reveal what is happening deep in your code with end to end transaction tracing and a variety of color-coded charts and reports. Identify problems before your users do Our APM agents report and store the state of your application so you can quickly identify potential problems before they affect your end users. With APM, your DevOps teams don't need to guess whether a performance blocker comes from the app itself, CPU availability, database loads, or something entirely unexpected. Use our APM solutions to gather both current and historical information about memory usage, CPU utilization, database query performance, web browser rendering performance, app availability, error analysis, external services, and other useful metrics. We have agents for Go, Java, .NET, Node.js, PHP, Python, and Ruby, as well as a C SDK. Monitor all aspects of your business Take advantage of these APM features, and more: Features Description App performance at a glance When you sign in to APM and select an app for your account, use the Summary page to quickly examine relationships across different aspects of your environment; for example: Web transactions response time: Where is the most time being spent? In the request queue, during different stages of page rendering and execution, from external services, or something else? Transaction traces: Which transactions are the slowest, and why? Error rate and throughput: What relationship is there between a spike in errors or slower throughput for a particular time period? Was there a deployment or outage at that time? Hosts: What kind of impact does this have on CPU usage, memory, etc.? Apdex: How are these events affecting customers' satisfaction with the site? Web and non-web transactions Start by comparing the top twenty web transactions or non-web transactions in terms of most time consuming, slowest average response time, highest throughput, or worst Apdex. From there, drill down into deeper trace levels for individual transactions, which in turn break down into smaller segments and components, from HTTPS requests on down to SQL queries. Want to explore even deeper? Set up distributed tracing to see how requests move across a distributed system. Select the transactions that are most important to your business (key transactions). APM and Infrastructure When your APM and Infrastructure accounts are linked, you will have access to APM data charts on these Infrastructure UI pages: Hosts, Network, Storage, and Processes. Distributed tracing Distributed tracing gives you visibility across distributed systems, showing you the path of a request as it travels between services. This feature is especially valuable for large, distributed systems that rely on many small services and microservices. Logs Bring your logs and APM agent data together to see logs associated with various objects in the New Relic UI such as applications, APM errors, APM traces, and Kubernetes containers. Service maps APM's service maps show your app's connections and dependencies, including databases and external services. Health indicators and performance metrics show you the current operational status for every part of your architecture. You can create and customize service maps to visualize and monitor your complex architectures. Query your data You can query and visualize your data: Sample and search APM transaction and error data to gain full understanding of the data being collected. Browse your data visually with the data explorer. Create custom SQL-like queries of your data using the New Relic Query Language (NRQL), or using our PromQL-style queries.

Apdex T is the response time above which a transaction is considered \"tolerable.\" You can define Apdex T values for each application, with separate values for app server and end-user browser performance. You can also define individual Apdex T thresholds for key transactions. Important You can only change Apdex thresholds for apps that are actively reporting data. For example, if one of your apps is not reporting, you won't see its Apdex setting options. App server Apdex settings The default Apdex T threshold for an application server is 0.5 seconds. To change the default application server threshold for web transactions: Go to one.newrelic.com > (select an app) > Settings > Application > Application settings. From the Application server section, set the Apdex T value (in seconds) for this application. Select Save application settings. After you change Apdex settings, a black vertical bar appears in the main chart on the APM Summary page. End-user (Browser) Apdex settings The default Apdex T threshold for browser monitoring is 7.0 seconds. To change the default end user threshold for Apdex T: Go to one.newrelic.com > Browser > (select an app) > Settings > Application settings. From the Settings page, set the end user Apdex T value (in seconds). Select Save application settings. Key transaction Apdex settings You can set custom Apdex values for your key transactions. These values are independent of the APM and browser Apdex values for the key transaction's parent application. Key transactions will contribute to the overall Apdex score based on their own Apdex T values. The default values are inherited from the parent application. Apdex alerting You can also configure alert conditions for Apdex. When the Apdex score passes the threshold you define, New Relic sends an alert to the notification mechanism (channel).

Apdex T is the response time above which a transaction is considered \"tolerable.\" You can define Apdex T values for each application, with separate values for app server and end-user browser performance. You can also define individual Apdex T thresholds for key transactions. Important You can only change Apdex thresholds for apps that are actively reporting data. For example, if one of your apps is not reporting, you won't see its Apdex setting options. App server Apdex settings The default Apdex T threshold for an application server is 0.5 seconds. To change the default application server threshold for web transactions: Go to one.newrelic.com > (select an app) > Settings > Application > Application settings. From the Application server section, set the Apdex T value (in seconds) for this application. Select Save application settings. After you change Apdex settings, a black vertical bar appears in the main chart on the APM Summary page. End-user (Browser) Apdex settings The default Apdex T threshold for browser monitoring is 7.0 seconds. To change the default end user threshold for Apdex T: Go to one.newrelic.com > Browser > (select an app) > Settings > Application settings. From the Settings page, set the end user Apdex T value (in seconds). Select Save application settings. Key transaction Apdex settings You can set custom Apdex values for your key transactions. These values are independent of the APM and browser Apdex values for the key transaction's parent application. Key transactions will contribute to the overall Apdex score based on their own Apdex T values. The default values are inherited from the parent application. Apdex alerting You can also configure alert conditions for Apdex. When the Apdex score passes the threshold you define, New Relic sends an alert to the notification mechanism (channel). Tip For Apdex scores, set Warning (yellow) conditions higher than Critical (red) conditions for Apdex scores. This will help you monitor your customers' experience before the Apdex level falls below an unsatisfactory level.",

      "body": "Our APM agents and mobile agents have limits on the number of events that can be reported. This document explains: Why event-reporting limits are necessary How sampling works How to work with and understand sampled data Difference between events and metrics This document is about limits on event data and how those limits lead to sampling. First, it may help you to understand the differences between these two types of data: Metrics: aggregated measurements over time. Examples: average response time over a one-minute time range, throughput over time, CPU utilization over time. Events: discrete events that happen at a specific moment in time. Examples: a log or error being reported, or a configuration change. Some events are aggregated over time to form metrics (for example: a count of errors over time). These two types of data have different uses: metrics are useful for recognizing patterns over time in your system, and events are useful for drilling down and getting detail about the causes of those patterns. Because metrics are aggregated over time, they’re useful for spotting trends and changes in system behavior. For metrics that represent an aggregated count of events (like an HTTP response time metric), the individual events give you granular detail about what happened, and let you facet by attributes that have high cardinality (like account or user ID). Why sampling of events is necessary Our APM agents and mobile agents have limits on how many events can be reported per harvest cycle. This is necessary because if there were no limit, a very large number of events being sent could have performance impacts on your application or on New Relic. When the limit is reached, the agents begin sampling events. Different agents have different limits, but the goal is to give a representative sample from across the harvest cycle. Also, agents may sample if they can't connect to New Relic. When an agent can’t connect to New Relic, it continues to store data locally. But it must restrict the size of the payload that is eventually sent. For this reason, it samples events during the disconnected period. The longer it is disconnected, the more it will sample. The impact of sampling One result of sampling is that there can be a discrepancy between unsampled metric data and sampled event data. Examples of this: An APM chart showing unsampled metric data may show you higher throughput than an equivalent NRQL query of sampled event data. For more about the difference between our metric timeslice data and event data, see Data types. A non-New Relic monitoring service may show different results from New Relic. Events that are capped and subject to sampling include: Transaction TransactionError Span (see Distributed tracing sampling) Custom events reported via agent API (example: the .NET agent's RecordCustomEvent) Mobile MobileRequest MobileCrash MobileHandledException Important For APM, you can compensate for sampling when querying data. Change how sampling occurs Before attempting to change how sampling occurs, please read these caveats and recommendations: Reporting more events will result in the agent using more memory. There will usually be a way for you to get the data you need without raising an agent's event-reporting limit. The payload size limit is 1MB (10^6 bytes) (compressed), so the number of events may still be affected by that limit. To determine if events are being dropped, see the agent log for a 413 HTTP status message. Here are some ways to impact sampling: Most agents have configuration options for changing the limit on sampled transactions (examples: Java agent’s max_samples_stored or the Android mobile agent’s setMaxEventPoolSize). If it’s important to you that a specific app activity not be sampled, you can use the Event API. You could deploy your application across a greater number of instances. Because the limits are per-agent, more agents will mean a larger event reservoir. APM: Compensate for sampling When querying APM-reported events, you can compensate for sampling by using EXTRAPOLATE. This will give you an approximation of what unsampled data looks like.",

Depending on your account level's data retention policy, you can view daily, weekly, or monthly reports. View SLA reports To view the SLA reports for your app: Go to one.newrelic.com > Applications > (select an app) > Reports > SLA. The report defaults to the Weekly SLA report tab. SLA report data shows the account owner's time zone, with periods beginning and ending at midnight in that time zone. If you have not enabled browser for your app, the SLA report shows links to requests, response time, and Apdex only for your application server. If you want to...

      "body": "Application performance monitoring (APM) provides monitoring of your web or non-web application's performance. APM supports apps using several programming languages. Our APM agents give you real-time observability matched with trending data about your application's performance and the user experience. Agents reveal what is happening deep in your code with end to end transaction tracing and a variety of color-coded charts and reports. Identify problems before your users do Our APM agents report and store the state of your application so you can quickly identify potential problems before they affect your end users. With APM, your DevOps teams don't need to guess whether a performance blocker comes from the app itself, CPU availability, database loads, or something entirely unexpected. Use our APM solutions to gather both current and historical information about memory usage, CPU utilization, database query performance, web browser rendering performance, app availability, error analysis, external services, and other useful metrics. We have agents for Go, Java, .NET, Node.js, PHP, Python, and Ruby, as well as a C SDK. Monitor all aspects of your business Take advantage of these APM features, and more: Features Description App performance at a glance When you sign in to APM and select an app for your account, use the Summary page to quickly examine relationships across different aspects of your environment; for example: Web transactions response time: Where is the most time being spent? In the request queue, during different stages of page rendering and execution, from external services, or something else? Transaction traces: Which transactions are the slowest, and why? Error rate and throughput: What relationship is there between a spike in errors or slower throughput for a particular time period? Was there a deployment or outage at that time? Hosts: What kind of impact does this have on CPU usage, memory, etc.? Apdex: How are these events affecting customers' satisfaction with the site? Web and non-web transactions Start by comparing the top twenty web transactions or non-web transactions in terms of most time consuming, slowest average response time, highest throughput, or worst Apdex. From there, drill down into deeper trace levels for individual transactions, which in turn break down into smaller segments and components, from HTTPS requests on down to SQL queries. Want to explore even deeper? Set up distributed tracing to see how requests move across a distributed system. Select the transactions that are most important to your business (key transactions). APM and Infrastructure When your APM and Infrastructure accounts are linked, you will have access to APM data charts on these Infrastructure UI pages: Hosts, Network, Storage, and Processes. Distributed tracing Distributed tracing gives you visibility across distributed systems, showing you the path of a request as it travels between services. This feature is especially valuable for large, distributed systems that rely on many small services and microservices. Logs Bring your logs and APM agent data together to see logs associated with various objects in the New Relic UI such as applications, APM errors, APM traces, and Kubernetes containers. Service maps APM's service maps show your app's connections and dependencies, including databases and external services. Health indicators and performance metrics show you the current operational status for every part of your architecture. You can create and customize service maps to visualize and monitor your complex architectures. Query your data You can query and visualize your data: Sample and search APM transaction and error data to gain full understanding of the data being collected. Browse your data visually with the data explorer. Create custom SQL-like queries of your data using the New Relic Query Language (NRQL), or using our PromQL-style queries. Use dashboards to build advanced data visualizations, contextualize data, and understand what's going on in your system, real-time. These are just a few of APM's features. To find out more, see the table of contents for APM. Ready to get started? Start benefiting from APM in 5 simple steps (and just a few minutes!). Sign up for a New Relic account (it's free, forever!). Install and customize the language agent for your app. Generate some traffic for your app. Wait a few minutes for New Relic to start receiving your data. Log in to your account, and start exploring New Relic! Use the Explorer in New Relic One to access and observe the full stack of your software, including your apps, see performance data and alerting status at a glance, and check relationships. We provide you with a simple, yet powerful visual tool to monitor all your entities, that is, anything we can identify that reports data. In the New Relic ecosystem, entities include basic components like applications, hosts, containers, or database services, but it can also refer to custom groupings of such elements. You can also create your own entities. If data does not appear after waiting a few minutes, follow the troubleshooting tips for your APM agent.",

      "body": "The APM Summary page provides general information about the selected app, including web transactions and non-web transactions, Apdex score, CPU usage, throughput (requests per minute or rpm), transaction times, error rate, application activity, and hosts. Tip To get a high-level overview of all your applications and services, use the New Relic explorer. View your app's summary page To reach the Summary page, go to one.newrelic.com > Explorer > Services - APM > (select an app). Use the Explorer to access all your entities, that is, anything we can identify that reports data, from applications and hosts to custom groupings of any elements. Alternatively, you can go to one.newrelic.com > APM > (select an app). For more information, see the documentation about navigating core UI components in New Relic One. View app performance Use the Summary page for a quick summary of your website's performance. Overview charts Some charts include links to APM pages where you can drill down into additional details. APM Summary chart Comments Transactions response time This stacked chart represents the response time of web transactions or non-web transactions in your app. Segments in the chart vary depending on which agent you are using. Some charts may have an independent line for response time that represents the relationship between response time and total time. Also, for your external or background services, you may see data labeled as Web external. For more information about these out-of-process services, use the Externals page. Apdex score This chart measures the performance of your app based on its Apdex T value during the selected time window. To view additional details, hover over the question icon or the chart's End user and App server lines. The End user line charts the Apdex for your browser apps, and the App server line charts the Apdex for your APM apps. Throughput This chart illustrates the requests per minute for either web transactions or non-web transactions. To change the type of transaction, select the Transaction response time chart's dropdown arrow, then select Web or Non-web. Error rate This chart shows the number of errors that have occurred in the current time window. The tooltip that appears when you hover over the Error rate chart shows the combined throughput for both web and non-web transactions. To understand how error rate is calculated, see Application error rate example. Event markers Markers on the main Summary chart indicate events and changes to the app: Black vertical bar: Apdex settings have changed. Blue vertical bar: A deployment marker has been created or another event has occurred, such as a settings change for the app. Yellow or red area: This indicates alert thresholds have been violated. To view additional information, mouse over the marker. Drill-down details Use any of New Relic's standard page functions to drill down into detailed information. Here is a summary of additional options with the APM Summary page. If you want to... Do this... Change how data appears on the main chart Select the chart title's drop-down arrow, and then select your choice of view options, including histograms or percentiles if available. View threshold levels for your app's Apdex score Mouse over the Apdex score ? icon. For non-web transactions, the Apdex chart is blank because Apdex is not applicable to this class of apps. View trends in transaction time, Apdex, and throughput Select the Compare with yesterday and last week checkbox. The checkbox is only available when viewing the Web transaction response time chart with the time picker window Ending now. The checkbox is unavailable if you are viewing histograms, percentiles, or custom dates. View app performance since the last deployment From the time picker, select Performance since the last deployment. For detailed information about all deployments, select the Deployments page. View the Transactions page Select the Transactions table's heading on the APM Summary page. Or, to view details about a specific transaction (including operations, transaction traces, and key transactions), select its name. View the Databases or External services pages Click on a related time band in the Web transactions response time chart. View the Errors page Select the Error rate chart's title on the APM Summary page. You can also view the Errors page from one.newrelic.com > (select an app) > Events > Errors. Browser monitoring data If you install the browser agent via an APM agent, you can automatically link the browser-monitored app to the APM-monitored app. Once the browser agent is set up, the APM Summary page provides summary information and direct links to detailed information on the app's corresponding browser summary page. To view chart details with browser page load time, select the main chart's Browser link. To view the Apdex score for browsers, select the Apdex chart's Browser link. Link app performance to resources The APM Summary page shows a table with averages about your app's instances on their hosts, including: Apdex Response time Throughput Error rate CPU usage Memory Tip CPU usage percentage is calculated as though the application is running on one CPU core. For more information about this calculation, see CPU usage is over 100%. Examine app performance within system context Use any of these options to examine your app's performance within the context of your system's architecture and resources, such as individual hosts: Select your choice from the table at the bottom of the APM Summary page for infrastructure. Toggle between a table view or breakout metric details. If applicable, select your choice from the drop-down at the top of the APM Summary page for servers or JVMs. Examine details within infrastructure To help you understand the full context of your app's performance within your environment, New Relic APM includes options to view performance from inside the application, as well as from outside the application with the infrastructure agent. To view detailed information from your resources' point of view, click any host link. The link takes you directly to the infrastructure Compute page. When you click, the Compute data may not immediately appear. If that happens, follow the prompt to validate your account and complete the conversion process for the infrastructure agent. If you need additional help, get support at support.newrelic.com. Troubleshoot host link To troubleshoot the host link from the APM Summary page, use these tips: Host link from APM Summary Troubleshooting tips Your infrastructure agent is not installed on the host. Follow standard procedures to install our infrastructure agent. The application is operating within a container, and your infrastructure agent is installed on the container’s host. Set the hostname for the container to be the hostname of the underlying server. Docker containers: Run your Docker container with the argument: --uts=\"host\" Copy This will cause the container to share the UTS Linux Namespace with the underlying host. However, by using this set, a privileged container could change the host's hostname. The application is running on a Windows container, and your infrastructure agent is installed on the Windows host. To get a direct link to infrastructure metric data for your application, enable process metrics in the infrastructure agent's configuration. Your infrastructure agent is installed, but it only reports the short hostname, not the long hostname. Configure your server's hostname settings so that the infrastructure agent and the APM agent return the exact same name string. If possible, do so by editing your server's fully qualified domain name (FQDN) settings. The APM and infrastructure agents both read their hostname from the operating system's FQDN settings, so setting the hostname there ensures both agents share a single hostname. For more information, see the Java agent troubleshooting example.",

SLA tips Comments Requirements When using the cURL command examples, be sure to replace the placeholder text with your account ID, an API key, and the application ID. Time ranges You are not limited to standard day, week, or month time ranges. For example, you can extract metric data for a \"holiday weekend\" from 12/23 to 12/26 or \"the 20 minutes after our site had problems\" or whatever other period interests you. UTC XML time format You must specify the time in UTC XML format, so be sure to adjust for your time zone compared to UTC. For example, New Relic starts at 16:00:00 on the day before the selected data, since New Relic headquarters are in UTC-8. Summary reports When requesting metrics to use with summary reports, include the query string parameter summarize=true (v2) or summary=1 (v1) as shown in the examples. Scaled statistics Your report has some statistics that are scaled in the SLA reports in New Relic's user interface. New Relic changes the scale of page views in your report to show small numbers. Depending on your traffic, typically it might be displayed in thousands, millions, or billions. Recommendation: To avoid a string of zeroes, divide this number appropriately for your own purposes. End user statistics End user statistics will reflect only the calls in which the agent gathered browser data. For example, end user stats may not appear in situations such as: Browser types Clients (they might have disabled the JavaScript agent, or blocked traffic to New Relic sites for JavaScript code's location Transactions not in one of those categories, in case the page load did not complete for any reason This is why there are fewer (sometimes many fewer) page views in the End User (browser) data section than in the App server data section. Examples The following sections contain code examples to acquire the data for values described above for the Daily (24hr) SLA statistics in the default GMT/UTC time zone.

      "body": "Application performance monitoring (APM) provides monitoring of your web or non-web application's performance. APM supports apps using several programming languages. Our APM agents give you real-time observability matched with trending data about your application's performance and the user experience. Agents reveal what is happening deep in your code with end to end transaction tracing and a variety of color-coded charts and reports. Identify problems before your users do Our APM agents report and store the state of your application so you can quickly identify potential problems before they affect your end users. With APM, your DevOps teams don't need to guess whether a performance blocker comes from the app itself, CPU availability, database loads, or something entirely unexpected. Use our APM solutions to gather both current and historical information about memory usage, CPU utilization, database query performance, web browser rendering performance, app availability, error analysis, external services, and other useful metrics. We have agents for Go, Java, .NET, Node.js, PHP, Python, and Ruby, as well as a C SDK. Monitor all aspects of your business Take advantage of these APM features, and more: Features Description App performance at a glance When you sign in to APM and select an app for your account, use the Summary page to quickly examine relationships across different aspects of your environment; for example: Web transactions response time: Where is the most time being spent? In the request queue, during different stages of page rendering and execution, from external services, or something else? Transaction traces: Which transactions are the slowest, and why? Error rate and throughput: What relationship is there between a spike in errors or slower throughput for a particular time period? Was there a deployment or outage at that time? Hosts: What kind of impact does this have on CPU usage, memory, etc.? Apdex: How are these events affecting customers' satisfaction with the site? Web and non-web transactions Start by comparing the top twenty web transactions or non-web transactions in terms of most time consuming, slowest average response time, highest throughput, or worst Apdex. From there, drill down into deeper trace levels for individual transactions, which in turn break down into smaller segments and components, from HTTPS requests on down to SQL queries. Want to explore even deeper? Set up distributed tracing to see how requests move across a distributed system. Select the transactions that are most important to your business (key transactions). APM and Infrastructure When your APM and Infrastructure accounts are linked, you will have access to APM data charts on these Infrastructure UI pages: Hosts, Network, Storage, and Processes. Distributed tracing Distributed tracing gives you visibility across distributed systems, showing you the path of a request as it travels between services. This feature is especially valuable for large, distributed systems that rely on many small services and microservices. Logs Bring your logs and APM agent data together to see logs associated with various objects in the New Relic UI such as applications, APM errors, APM traces, and Kubernetes containers. Service maps APM's service maps show your app's connections and dependencies, including databases and external services. Health indicators and performance metrics show you the current operational status for every part of your architecture. You can create and customize service maps to visualize and monitor your complex architectures. Query your data You can query and visualize your data: Sample and search APM transaction and error data to gain full understanding of the data being collected. Browse your data visually with the data explorer. Create custom SQL-like queries of your data using the New Relic Query Language (NRQL), or using our PromQL-style queries. Use dashboards to build advanced data visualizations, contextualize data, and understand what's going on in your system, real-time. These are just a few of APM's features. To find out more, see the table of contents for APM. Ready to get started? Start benefiting from APM in 5 simple steps (and just a few minutes!). Sign up for a New Relic account (it's free, forever!). Install and customize the language agent for your app. Generate some traffic for your app. Wait a few minutes for New Relic to start receiving your data. Log in to your account, and start exploring New Relic! Use the Explorer in New Relic One to access and observe the full stack of your software, including your apps, see performance data and alerting status at a glance, and check relationships. We provide you with a simple, yet powerful visual tool to monitor all your entities, that is, anything we can identify that reports data. In the New Relic ecosystem, entities include basic components like applications, hosts, containers, or database services, but it can also refer to custom groupings of such elements. You can also create your own entities. If data does not appear after waiting a few minutes, follow the troubleshooting tips for your APM agent.",

Tip To get a high-level overview of all your applications and services, use the New Relic explorer. View your app's summary page To reach the Summary page, go to one.newrelic.com > Explorer > Services - APM > (select an app). Use the Explorer to access all your entities, that is, anything we can identify that reports data, from applications and hosts to custom groupings of any elements. Alternatively, you can go to one.newrelic.com > APM > (select an app). For more information, see the documentation about navigating core UI components in New Relic One. View app performance Use the Summary page for a quick summary of your website's performance. Overview charts Some charts include links to APM pages where you can drill down into additional details. APM Summary chart Comments Transactions response time This stacked chart represents the response time of web transactions or non-web transactions in your app. Segments in the chart vary depending on which agent you are using. Some charts may have an independent line for response time that represents the relationship between response time and total time. Also, for your external or background services, you may see data labeled as Web external. For more information about these out-of-process services, use the Externals page. Apdex score This chart measures the performance of your app based on its Apdex T value during the selected time window. To view additional details, hover over the question icon or the chart's End user and App server lines. The End user line charts the Apdex for your browser apps, and the App server line charts the Apdex for your APM apps. Throughput This chart illustrates the requests per minute for either web transactions or non-web transactions. To change the type of transaction, select the Transaction response time chart's dropdown arrow, then select Web or Non-web. Error rate This chart shows the number of errors that have occurred in the current time window. The tooltip that appears when you hover over the Error rate chart shows the combined throughput for both web and non-web transactions. To understand how error rate is calculated, see Application error rate example. Event markers Markers on the main Summary chart indicate events and changes to the app: Black vertical bar: Apdex settings have changed. Blue vertical bar: A deployment marker has been created or another event has occurred, such as a settings change for the app. Yellow or red area: This indicates alert thresholds have been violated. To view additional information, mouse over the marker. Drill-down details Use any of New Relic's standard page functions to drill down into detailed information. Here is a summary of additional options with the APM Summary page. If you want to... Do this... Change how data appears on the main chart Select the chart title's drop-down arrow, and then select your choice of view options, including histograms or percentiles if available. View threshold levels for your app's Apdex score Mouse over the Apdex score ? icon. For non-web transactions, the Apdex chart is blank because Apdex is not applicable to this class of apps. View trends in transaction time, Apdex, and throughput Select the Compare with yesterday and last week checkbox. The checkbox is only available when viewing the Web transaction response time chart with the time picker window Ending now. The checkbox is unavailable if you are viewing histograms, percentiles, or custom dates. View app performance since the last deployment From the time picker, select Performance since the last deployment. For detailed information about all deployments, select the Deployments page. View the Transactions page Select the Transactions table's heading on the APM Summary page. Or, to view details about a specific transaction (including operations, transaction traces, and key transactions), select its name. View the Databases or External services pages Click on a related time band in the Web transactions response time chart. View the Errors page Select the Error rate chart's title on the APM Summary page. You can also view the Errors page from one.newrelic.com > (select an app) > Events > Errors. Browser monitoring data If you install the browser agent via an APM agent, you can automatically link the browser-monitored app to the APM-monitored app. Once the browser agent is set up, the APM Summary page provides summary information and direct links to detailed information on the app's corresponding browser summary page. To view chart details with browser page load time, select the main chart's Browser link. To view the Apdex score for browsers, select the Apdex chart's Browser link. Link app performance to resources The APM Summary page shows a table with averages about your app's instances on their hosts, including: Apdex Response time Throughput Error rate CPU usage Memory Tip CPU usage percentage is calculated as though the application is running on one CPU core. For more information about this calculation, see CPU usage is over 100%. Examine app performance within system context Use any of these options to examine your app's performance within the context of your system's architecture and resources, such as individual hosts: Select your choice from the table at the bottom of the APM Summary page for infrastructure. Toggle between a table view or breakout metric details. If applicable, select your choice from the drop-down at the top of the APM Summary page for servers or JVMs. Examine details within infrastructure To help you understand the full context of your app's performance within your environment, New Relic APM includes options to view performance from inside the application, as well as from outside the application with the infrastructure agent. To view detailed information from your resources' point of view, click any host link. The link takes you directly to the infrastructure Compute page. When you click, the Compute data may not immediately appear. If that happens, follow the prompt to validate your account and complete the conversion process for the infrastructure agent. If you need additional help, get support at support.newrelic.com. Troubleshoot host link To troubleshoot the host link from the APM Summary page, use these tips: Host link from APM Summary Troubleshooting tips Your infrastructure agent is not installed on the host. Follow standard procedures to install our infrastructure agent. The application is operating within a container, and your infrastructure agent is installed on the container’s host. Set the hostname for the container to be the hostname of the underlying server. Docker containers: Run your Docker container with the argument: --uts=\"host\" Copy This will cause the container to share the UTS Linux Namespace with the underlying host. However, by using this set, a privileged container could change the host's hostname. The application is running on a Windows container, and your infrastructure agent is installed on the Windows host. To get a direct link to infrastructure metric data for your application, enable process metrics in the infrastructure agent's configuration. Your infrastructure agent is installed, but it only reports the short hostname, not the long hostname. Configure your server's hostname settings so that the infrastructure agent and the APM agent return the exact same name string. If possible, do so by editing your server's fully qualified domain name (FQDN) settings. The APM and infrastructure agents both read their hostname from the operating system's FQDN settings, so setting the hostname there ensures both agents share a single hostname. For more information, see the Java agent troubleshooting example.",

      "body": "Here are troubleshooting tips when using cross application traces. Note that this feature is not the same as distributed tracing, which is preferred over cross application tracing. Agent versions and protocols Make sure you meet these requirements for your agent's version, protocols, interfaces, or message queue libraries. If you are using a protocol that is not listed here, you will not see a connection between your applications. Agent version Notes C SDK Use distributed tracing. Go 1.11 or higher HTTP, HTTPS Java 3.9.0 or higher HTTP, HTTPs, JMS 1.1, RabbitMQ The Java agent also supports several message queue libraries, including those that use the JMS 1.1 interface. .NET 4.2 or higher HTTP, and supported .NET messaging systems Node.js 2.0.0 or higher HTTP, HTTPS, RabbitMQ PHP 4.19.0 or higher HTTP, HTTPS, and supported PHP message queuing systems Python 2.38.0.31 or higher HTTP, HTTPS, and supported Python message queuing systems Ruby 4.3.0 or higher HTTP, HTTPS, RabbitMQ Config file requirements In general, New Relic's cross application tracing feature is enabled by default. Requirements to change your configuration file vary, depending on your New Relic agent: C SDK (not supported) Go (not supported) Java .NET Node.js (no specific config file settings needed for Node.js) PHP Python Ruby High throughput apps Cross application traces rely on transaction events to associate related transactions. If you have a high throughput application, your agent may reach the maximum number of events that it can record in a minute and will fall back to sampling events. If a transaction’s events are sampled, you may see an incomplete cross application trace, including sometimes only the transactions that you are focused on. If your application has high throughput, some cross application traces will appear incomplete, sometimes with no links. Try viewing a different transaction trace. To reduce or eliminate sampling, you can also adjust the number of transaction events stored in your agent configuration. High throughput apps Troubleshooting tips Java From the transaction_events stanza, adjust the setting for max_samples_stored. Ruby Adjust the setting for analytics_events.max_samples_stored. Proxies If you expect to see a cross application trace link but it consistently does not appear, there may be a proxy or broker between your application’s communication. Cross application tracing relies on HTTP headers and JMS properties being passed from one application to other. HTTP proxies and message brokers sometimes strip those headers. Multi-threaded processing (Java) If one or more of your Java applications uses an async or \"reactive\" programming model, a transaction's activity may span across multiple threads. New Relic supports the Play framework and Servlet Async but not all async frameworks. For unsupported frameworks, activity on other threads is not reported as part of the transaction. Calls to other applications will not be traced. Multiple accounts Currently cross application traces do not cross New Relic accounts. If you have multiple New Relic accounts (including child accounts), you will only see traces for applications within one account. Our distributed tracing feature does cross account boundaries.",

      "body": "The word transaction can have several different meanings in the software industry. This document explains how the term is used by New Relic and how transactions are reported. What is a transaction? At New Relic, a transaction is defined as one logical unit of work in a software application. Specifically, it refers to the function calls and method calls that make up that unit of work. For APM, it will often refer to a web transaction, which represents activity that happens from when the application receives a web request to when the response is sent. When you install APM in a supported system, it begins automatically reporting web requests and other important functions and methods. To supplement the default level of monitoring, you can set up custom instrumentation to report additional transactions. Some frameworks do not have a natural concept of a transaction. In other words, there are no predefined pathways that can easily be recognized or monitored as transactions. To define transactions in such frameworks, you can use custom instrumentation. Types of transactions Cumulative transaction data appears in APM on the Transactions page. The two main categories of transactions are web and non-web: Web: Transactions are initiated with an HTTP request. For most organizations, these represent customer-centric interactions and thus are the most important transactions to monitor. Non-web: Non-web transactions are not initiated with a web request. They can include non-web worker processes, background processes, scripts, message queue activity, and other tasks. Transaction sub-types Our agents have these transaction sub-types: C SDK Sub-type Description Custom The execution of the named custom transaction. Usually recorded via manual instrumentation APIs. Function The invocation of the named function. Go Doesn't apply. Java Sub-type Description Custom The execution of the named custom transaction. Usually recorded via manual instrumentation APIs. framework The invocation of a framework that is recognized by the agent. .NET Sub-type Description Action The invocation of the named framework action. Used when the agent is able to identify a framework-specific action name. ASP The invocation of an ASP.NET request. Custom The execution of the named custom transaction. Usually recorded via manual instrumentation APIs. MonoRail The invocation of a MonoRail request. MVC The invocation of a MVC request. OpenRasta The invocation of an OpenRasta request. StatusCode The HTTP status code returned for the transaction. Often used when a more specific transaction sub-type is unavailable. WCF The invocation of a WCF request. WebAPI The invocation of a WebAPI request. WebService The invocation of a WebService request. Node.JS Sub-type Description Custom The execution of the named custom transaction. Usually recorded via manual instrumentation APIs. Message Message broker or queue communication. PHP Sub-type Description Action The invocation of the named framework action. Used when the agent is able to identify a framework-specific action name. Custom The execution of the named custom transaction. Usually recorded via manual instrumentation APIs. Function The invocation of the named function. PHP The invocation of a background PHP job. StatusCode The HTTP status code returned for the transaction. Often used when a more specific transaction sub-type is unavailable. unknown The invocation of an unknown web transaction or background job. URI The invocation of the named URI. Usually used when a framework or language level transaction name cannot be determined. Python Sub-type Description ASGIWeb WebTransaction from an ASGI application. Message Message broker or queue communication. WSGIWeb WebTransaction from a WSGI application. Ruby Sub-type Description Custom The execution of the named custom transaction. Usually recorded via manual instrumentation APIs. Transaction segments The individual functions and calls that make up a transaction are called segments. For example external service calls and database calls are segments, and both have their own UI pages in APM. The APM Transactions page displays aggregate transaction segment data. To add segments to a transaction, use custom instrumentation. To see the segments of a specific transaction, use transaction traces. Transaction naming For supported frameworks, transaction names can come from various sources, such as the name given to the transaction by the framework, function names detected during the transaction, or a web request's URL. For transactions that produce many names with a similar format, we consolidate those into general transaction categories. For example, a transaction might be displayed as /user/*/control_panel, where the * represents different user names. To rename transactions or adjust how names are consolidated, use custom instrumentation. Monitoring transactions Here are some other ways you can use APM to monitor transactions: If you want to monitor... Use this... Transactions important to your business Create key transactions, which emphasizes them in the UI and lets you set a custom level of monitoring for them. Async activity Follow the procedures to set up asynchronous activity for your specific APM language agent. Activity across applications Linking transactions across applications gives you more detail about business-relevant application activity. For more information, see the documentation about distributed tracing and cross application traces. Tip To get a high-level overview of all your applications and services, use the New Relic Explorer. Query transactions Transactions are available for querying with an in-depth set of default attributes attached. Using these attributes, you can run queries and create custom charts that APM does not provide by default. For information on how to query your data using our UI or NRQL, see Query New Relic data.",

      "body": "In APM, transaction traces record in-depth details about your application's transactions and database calls. You can edit the default settings for transaction traces. Configure transaction trace settings via agent You can customize your transaction trace settings via New Relic agent configuration files and other \"local\" configuration methods such as environment variables. For more information about transaction trace configuration options, see the specific New Relic language agent's documentation: C SDK Go Java .NET Node PHP Python Ruby Configure transaction traces using server-side configuration The ability to configure transaction traces using server-side configuration depends on the New Relic agent. If server-side configuration is not supported, the transaction trace settings will be visible in the UI but not editable. If server-side configuration settings are available for your New Relic agent, you can see them at the following: one.newrelic.com > APM > (select an app) > Settings > Application > Server-side agent configuration. Transaction trace settings available using server-side configuration will differ depending on the New Relic agent you use. The UI includes descriptions of each. Settings in the UI may include: Transaction tracing and threshold Record SQL, including recording level and input fields Log SQL and stack trace threshold SQL query plans and threshold Error collection, including HTTP code and error class Slow query tracing Thread profiler Cross application tracing Configure traces for specific (key) transactions If you want to monitor or alert on a transaction differently than other transactions, make it a key transaction. This is useful, for example, when you want to set a transaction-specific Apdex that is different from your general Apdex T threshold. Changing a key transaction's Apdex changes the likelihood that it creates a transaction trace. For example: If you want to make it more likely a key transaction would generate transaction traces, lower its Apdex T value. If you want to make a key transaction less likely to be traced, raise its Apdex T value. Important If you have the transaction trace threshold set to a number of seconds, and not to the default Apdex setting, the number-of-seconds threshold will act as the threshold for all transactions, even for key transactions that have custom Apdex settings. Create custom transactions You can create custom transactions for app activity that isn't being automatically captured as a transaction by the New Relic agent. For more information, see Custom instrumentation. Collect HTTP request attributes, parameters For data security reasons, transaction traces do not collect potentially sensitive HTTP request attributes, sometimes called parameters. Traces do collect some basic HTTP request attributes, which New Relic calls agent attributes. To edit attribute collection settings, see the specific New Relic agent: C SDK Go Java .NET Node.js (does not allow HTTP attribute configuration) PHP Python Ruby For more information, see Collect custom attributes. Delete a transaction trace When you delete a transaction trace, it is deleted permanently. Delete a single transaction trace To delete a transaction trace record permanently: Go to one.newrelic.com > APM > (select an app) > Monitor > Transactions. Under Transaction traces click on the trace you want to delete. On the details page, select Delete this trace. Delete all transaction traces To delete all traces for the selected app permanently: Go to one.newrelic.com > APM > (select an app) > Monitor > Transactions. Click Delete all traces. It may take fifteen minutes or more for all transaction trace records to disappear from the UI. To delete all traces for your account, contact us at support.newrelic.com. Tip If you are doing general record cleanup, you may also want to delete databases and slow query traces or error traces. This will remove potentially sensitive data while retaining your other application data (such as Apdex, deployment information, etc.).",

      "body": "New Relic APM's cross application tracing lets you link transactions between your APM-monitored applications. What is cross application tracing? Important Instead of using cross application tracing, we recommend our distributed tracing features. Distributed tracing is an improvement on the cross application tracing feature and is recommended for large, distributed systems. New Relic APM's cross application traces link transactions between APM apps in your service-oriented architecture (SOA). This is useful, for example, to identify performance problems between your own application (the \"calling\" app) and any internal or external services (the \"called\" app), such as traffic to internal services. This helps you to: Spot bottlenecks in your cross application call flows. Understand from end to end how specific transactions are used by other applications and services. Diagnose problems faster and enhance collaboration across teams. Security considerations Cross application tracing relies on three HTTP headers in order to exchange information between the calling and called applications. The first two (X-NewRelic-ID and X-NewRelic-Transaction) appear as HTTP request headers in outgoing requests sent by an instrumented application. The remaining header (X-NewRelic-App-Data) is inserted into the HTTP response if the called application belongs to the same New Relic account as the calling application. New Relic obfuscates all of these headers using an obfuscation scheme identical to what we use for browser monitoring, but with a different key. HTTP header Description X-NewRelic-ID (in request header) Contains the account ID and application ID of the application making the call X-NewRelic-Transaction (in request header) Contains information about an individual transaction created by the call (a GUID unique to the calling transaction, along with information about upstream calls that spawned the transaction) X-NewRelic-App-Data (in the response if applicable) Contains information about the called application, including: Account ID Application ID Name of the called transaction Timing information for the called transaction GUID of the called transaction",

      "body": "The word transaction can have several different meanings in the software industry. This document explains how the term is used by New Relic and how transactions are reported. What is a transaction? At New Relic, a transaction is defined as one logical unit of work in a software application. Specifically, it refers to the function calls and method calls that make up that unit of work. For APM, it will often refer to a web transaction, which represents activity that happens from when the application receives a web request to when the response is sent. When you install APM in a supported system, it begins automatically reporting web requests and other important functions and methods. To supplement the default level of monitoring, you can set up custom instrumentation to report additional transactions. Some frameworks do not have a natural concept of a transaction. In other words, there are no predefined pathways that can easily be recognized or monitored as transactions. To define transactions in such frameworks, you can use custom instrumentation. Types of transactions Cumulative transaction data appears in APM on the Transactions page. The two main categories of transactions are web and non-web: Web: Transactions are initiated with an HTTP request. For most organizations, these represent customer-centric interactions and thus are the most important transactions to monitor. Non-web: Non-web transactions are not initiated with a web request. They can include non-web worker processes, background processes, scripts, message queue activity, and other tasks. Transaction sub-types Our agents have these transaction sub-types: C SDK Sub-type Description Custom The execution of the named custom transaction. Usually recorded via manual instrumentation APIs. Function The invocation of the named function. Go Doesn't apply. Java Sub-type Description Custom The execution of the named custom transaction. Usually recorded via manual instrumentation APIs. framework The invocation of a framework that is recognized by the agent. .NET Sub-type Description Action The invocation of the named framework action. Used when the agent is able to identify a framework-specific action name. ASP The invocation of an ASP.NET request. Custom The execution of the named custom transaction. Usually recorded via manual instrumentation APIs. MonoRail The invocation of a MonoRail request. MVC The invocation of a MVC request. OpenRasta The invocation of an OpenRasta request. StatusCode The HTTP status code returned for the transaction. Often used when a more specific transaction sub-type is unavailable. WCF The invocation of a WCF request. WebAPI The invocation of a WebAPI request. WebService The invocation of a WebService request. Node.JS Sub-type Description Custom The execution of the named custom transaction. Usually recorded via manual instrumentation APIs. Message Message broker or queue communication. PHP Sub-type Description Action The invocation of the named framework action. Used when the agent is able to identify a framework-specific action name. Custom The execution of the named custom transaction. Usually recorded via manual instrumentation APIs. Function The invocation of the named function. PHP The invocation of a background PHP job. StatusCode The HTTP status code returned for the transaction. Often used when a more specific transaction sub-type is unavailable. unknown The invocation of an unknown web transaction or background job. URI The invocation of the named URI. Usually used when a framework or language level transaction name cannot be determined. Python Sub-type Description ASGIWeb WebTransaction from an ASGI application. Message Message broker or queue communication. WSGIWeb WebTransaction from a WSGI application. Ruby Sub-type Description Custom The execution of the named custom transaction. Usually recorded via manual instrumentation APIs. Transaction segments The individual functions and calls that make up a transaction are called segments. For example external service calls and database calls are segments, and both have their own UI pages in APM. The APM Transactions page displays aggregate transaction segment data. To add segments to a transaction, use custom instrumentation. To see the segments of a specific transaction, use transaction traces. Transaction naming For supported frameworks, transaction names can come from various sources, such as the name given to the transaction by the framework, function names detected during the transaction, or a web request's URL. For transactions that produce many names with a similar format, we consolidate those into general transaction categories. For example, a transaction might be displayed as /user/*/control_panel, where the * represents different user names. To rename transactions or adjust how names are consolidated, use custom instrumentation. Monitoring transactions Here are some other ways you can use APM to monitor transactions: If you want to monitor... Use this... Transactions important to your business Create key transactions, which emphasizes them in the UI and lets you set a custom level of monitoring for them. Async activity Follow the procedures to set up asynchronous activity for your specific APM language agent. Activity across applications Linking transactions across applications gives you more detail about business-relevant application activity. For more information, see the documentation about distributed tracing and cross application traces. Tip To get a high-level overview of all your applications and services, use the New Relic Explorer. Query transactions Transactions are available for querying with an in-depth set of default attributes attached. Using these attributes, you can run queries and create custom charts that APM does not provide by default. For information on how to query your data using our UI or NRQL, see Query New Relic data.",

      "body": "The APM Summary page provides general information about the selected app, including web transactions and non-web transactions, Apdex score, CPU usage, throughput (requests per minute or rpm), transaction times, error rate, application activity, and hosts. Tip To get a high-level overview of all your applications and services, use the New Relic explorer. View your app's summary page To reach the Summary page, go to one.newrelic.com > Explorer > Services - APM > (select an app). Use the Explorer to access all your entities, that is, anything we can identify that reports data, from applications and hosts to custom groupings of any elements. Alternatively, you can go to one.newrelic.com > APM > (select an app). For more information, see the documentation about navigating core UI components in New Relic One. View app performance Use the Summary page for a quick summary of your website's performance. Overview charts Some charts include links to APM pages where you can drill down into additional details. APM Summary chart Comments Transactions response time This stacked chart represents the response time of web transactions or non-web transactions in your app. Segments in the chart vary depending on which agent you are using. Some charts may have an independent line for response time that represents the relationship between response time and total time. Also, for your external or background services, you may see data labeled as Web external. For more information about these out-of-process services, use the Externals page. Apdex score This chart measures the performance of your app based on its Apdex T value during the selected time window. To view additional details, hover over the question icon or the chart's End user and App server lines. The End user line charts the Apdex for your browser apps, and the App server line charts the Apdex for your APM apps. Throughput This chart illustrates the requests per minute for either web transactions or non-web transactions. To change the type of transaction, select the Transaction response time chart's dropdown arrow, then select Web or Non-web. Error rate This chart shows the number of errors that have occurred in the current time window. The tooltip that appears when you hover over the Error rate chart shows the combined throughput for both web and non-web transactions. To understand how error rate is calculated, see Application error rate example. Event markers Markers on the main Summary chart indicate events and changes to the app: Black vertical bar: Apdex settings have changed. Blue vertical bar: A deployment marker has been created or another event has occurred, such as a settings change for the app. Yellow or red area: This indicates alert thresholds have been violated. To view additional information, mouse over the marker. Drill-down details Use any of New Relic's standard page functions to drill down into detailed information. Here is a summary of additional options with the APM Summary page. If you want to... Do this... Change how data appears on the main chart Select the chart title's drop-down arrow, and then select your choice of view options, including histograms or percentiles if available. View threshold levels for your app's Apdex score Mouse over the Apdex score ? icon. For non-web transactions, the Apdex chart is blank because Apdex is not applicable to this class of apps. View trends in transaction time, Apdex, and throughput Select the Compare with yesterday and last week checkbox. The checkbox is only available when viewing the Web transaction response time chart with the time picker window Ending now. The checkbox is unavailable if you are viewing histograms, percentiles, or custom dates. View app performance since the last deployment From the time picker, select Performance since the last deployment. For detailed information about all deployments, select the Deployments page. View the Transactions page Select the Transactions table's heading on the APM Summary page. Or, to view details about a specific transaction (including operations, transaction traces, and key transactions), select its name. View the Databases or External services pages Click on a related time band in the Web transactions response time chart. View the Errors page Select the Error rate chart's title on the APM Summary page. You can also view the Errors page from one.newrelic.com > (select an app) > Events > Errors. Browser monitoring data If you install the browser agent via an APM agent, you can automatically link the browser-monitored app to the APM-monitored app. Once the browser agent is set up, the APM Summary page provides summary information and direct links to detailed information on the app's corresponding browser summary page. To view chart details with browser page load time, select the main chart's Browser link. To view the Apdex score for browsers, select the Apdex chart's Browser link. Link app performance to resources The APM Summary page shows a table with averages about your app's instances on their hosts, including: Apdex Response time Throughput Error rate CPU usage Memory Tip CPU usage percentage is calculated as though the application is running on one CPU core. For more information about this calculation, see CPU usage is over 100%. Examine app performance within system context Use any of these options to examine your app's performance within the context of your system's architecture and resources, such as individual hosts: Select your choice from the table at the bottom of the APM Summary page for infrastructure. Toggle between a table view or breakout metric details. If applicable, select your choice from the drop-down at the top of the APM Summary page for servers or JVMs. Examine details within infrastructure To help you understand the full context of your app's performance within your environment, New Relic APM includes options to view performance from inside the application, as well as from outside the application with the infrastructure agent. To view detailed information from your resources' point of view, click any host link. The link takes you directly to the infrastructure Compute page. When you click, the Compute data may not immediately appear. If that happens, follow the prompt to validate your account and complete the conversion process for the infrastructure agent. If you need additional help, get support at support.newrelic.com. Troubleshoot host link To troubleshoot the host link from the APM Summary page, use these tips: Host link from APM Summary Troubleshooting tips Your infrastructure agent is not installed on the host. Follow standard procedures to install our infrastructure agent. The application is operating within a container, and your infrastructure agent is installed on the container’s host. Set the hostname for the container to be the hostname of the underlying server. Docker containers: Run your Docker container with the argument: --uts=\"host\" Copy This will cause the container to share the UTS Linux Namespace with the underlying host. However, by using this set, a privileged container could change the host's hostname. The application is running on a Windows container, and your infrastructure agent is installed on the Windows host. To get a direct link to infrastructure metric data for your application, enable process metrics in the infrastructure agent's configuration. Your infrastructure agent is installed, but it only reports the short hostname, not the long hostname. Configure your server's hostname settings so that the infrastructure agent and the APM agent return the exact same name string. If possible, do so by editing your server's fully qualified domain name (FQDN) settings. The APM and infrastructure agents both read their hostname from the operating system's FQDN settings, so setting the hostname there ensures both agents share a single hostname. For more information, see the Java agent troubleshooting example.",

      "body": "This document explains what non-web transactions are in APM, and how you can instrument background tasks and other arbitrary activity to be reported as non-web transactions. What are non-web transactions? The two main New Relic APM transaction categories are web and non-web. Web transactions are transactions we detect as being initiated by a web request; they are the most common type of transaction reported by APM. Non-web transactions are transactions that are not web transactions; we do not detect they were initiated by a web request. This includes processes and jobs that do not handle web requests, such as message processing and background tasks. For example, you might schedule something to run periodically on your server to do database work, send emails, etc. The source is not a web request but something on your server. Some non-web transactions from supported frameworks or services are detected automatically by New Relic; others may be created using custom instrumentation. We intentionally separate your web and non-web transactions in the UI. Non-web vs. web transactions Comments Less directly important Non-web transactions are often background processes and tasks, and they are less directly important to your application's users when compared to web transactions. Long running Non-web transactions are often long-running processes. Separating them from web transactions prevents those results from skewing your customer-facing response times. Omitted from Apdex score Combining your non-web transactions with your web transactions would hurt your Apdex score (a measure of satisfaction with load times). This is why Apdex data for non-web transactions does not appear in the UI. Create non-web transactions To create new non-web transactions, follow the procedures for your APM language agent. C SDK Follow the procedures for instrumenting a non-web transaction. Go Follow the procedures for instrumenting a non-web transaction. Java Follow the procedures for instrumenting a transaction (instrumenting a transaction without web request parameters creates a non-web transaction). .NET By default, the APM .NET agent instruments IIS ASP workers. To instrument other (non-IIS) .NET applications, such as standalone (WCF) services, console apps, and other Windows services, see Instrumenting custom applications and Instrumenting WCF applications. Important For IIS applications, you cannot change web transactions to non-web transactions. Node.js Use startBackgroundTransaction(). PHP To mark a transaction as non-web: use newrelic_background_job and set the flag to true. The PHP agent reports all command-line run scripts as non-web transactions. Python See Python agent non-web transactions. The Python agent also supports non-web transaction reporting from Celery and Gearman. Ruby See Ruby agent non-web transactions. View non-web transactions To view non-web transaction data in the New Relic UI, go to the main chart on the following pages, and then select the Non-web option in the dropdown: New Relic Explorer: Go to one.newrelic.com > Explorer > (select an app) > Summary.

      "body": "The APM Summary page provides general information about the selected app, including web transactions and non-web transactions, Apdex score, CPU usage, throughput (requests per minute or rpm), transaction times, error rate, application activity, and hosts. Tip To get a high-level overview of all your applications and services, use the New Relic explorer. View your app's summary page To reach the Summary page, go to one.newrelic.com > Explorer > Services - APM > (select an app). Use the Explorer to access all your entities, that is, anything we can identify that reports data, from applications and hosts to custom groupings of any elements. Alternatively, you can go to one.newrelic.com > APM > (select an app). For more information, see the documentation about navigating core UI components in New Relic One. View app performance Use the Summary page for a quick summary of your website's performance. Overview charts Some charts include links to APM pages where you can drill down into additional details. APM Summary chart Comments Transactions response time This stacked chart represents the response time of web transactions or non-web transactions in your app. Segments in the chart vary depending on which agent you are using. Some charts may have an independent line for response time that represents the relationship between response time and total time. Also, for your external or background services, you may see data labeled as Web external. For more information about these out-of-process services, use the Externals page. Apdex score This chart measures the performance of your app based on its Apdex T value during the selected time window. To view additional details, hover over the question icon or the chart's End user and App server lines. The End user line charts the Apdex for your browser apps, and the App server line charts the Apdex for your APM apps. Throughput This chart illustrates the requests per minute for either web transactions or non-web transactions. To change the type of transaction, select the Transaction response time chart's dropdown arrow, then select Web or Non-web. Error rate This chart shows the number of errors that have occurred in the current time window. The tooltip that appears when you hover over the Error rate chart shows the combined throughput for both web and non-web transactions. To understand how error rate is calculated, see Application error rate example. Event markers Markers on the main Summary chart indicate events and changes to the app: Black vertical bar: Apdex settings have changed. Blue vertical bar: A deployment marker has been created or another event has occurred, such as a settings change for the app. Yellow or red area: This indicates alert thresholds have been violated. To view additional information, mouse over the marker. Drill-down details Use any of New Relic's standard page functions to drill down into detailed information. Here is a summary of additional options with the APM Summary page. If you want to... Do this... Change how data appears on the main chart Select the chart title's drop-down arrow, and then select your choice of view options, including histograms or percentiles if available. View threshold levels for your app's Apdex score Mouse over the Apdex score ? icon. For non-web transactions, the Apdex chart is blank because Apdex is not applicable to this class of apps. View trends in transaction time, Apdex, and throughput Select the Compare with yesterday and last week checkbox. The checkbox is only available when viewing the Web transaction response time chart with the time picker window Ending now. The checkbox is unavailable if you are viewing histograms, percentiles, or custom dates. View app performance since the last deployment From the time picker, select Performance since the last deployment. For detailed information about all deployments, select the Deployments page. View the Transactions page Select the Transactions table's heading on the APM Summary page. Or, to view details about a specific transaction (including operations, transaction traces, and key transactions), select its name. View the Databases or External services pages Click on a related time band in the Web transactions response time chart. View the Errors page Select the Error rate chart's title on the APM Summary page. You can also view the Errors page from one.newrelic.com > (select an app) > Events > Errors. Browser monitoring data If you install the browser agent via an APM agent, you can automatically link the browser-monitored app to the APM-monitored app. Once the browser agent is set up, the APM Summary page provides summary information and direct links to detailed information on the app's corresponding browser summary page. To view chart details with browser page load time, select the main chart's Browser link. To view the Apdex score for browsers, select the Apdex chart's Browser link. Link app performance to resources The APM Summary page shows a table with averages about your app's instances on their hosts, including: Apdex Response time Throughput Error rate CPU usage Memory Tip CPU usage percentage is calculated as though the application is running on one CPU core. For more information about this calculation, see CPU usage is over 100%. Examine app performance within system context Use any of these options to examine your app's performance within the context of your system's architecture and resources, such as individual hosts: Select your choice from the table at the bottom of the APM Summary page for infrastructure. Toggle between a table view or breakout metric details. If applicable, select your choice from the drop-down at the top of the APM Summary page for servers or JVMs. Examine details within infrastructure To help you understand the full context of your app's performance within your environment, New Relic APM includes options to view performance from inside the application, as well as from outside the application with the infrastructure agent. To view detailed information from your resources' point of view, click any host link. The link takes you directly to the infrastructure Compute page. When you click, the Compute data may not immediately appear. If that happens, follow the prompt to validate your account and complete the conversion process for the infrastructure agent. If you need additional help, get support at support.newrelic.com. Troubleshoot host link To troubleshoot the host link from the APM Summary page, use these tips: Host link from APM Summary Troubleshooting tips Your infrastructure agent is not installed on the host. Follow standard procedures to install our infrastructure agent. The application is operating within a container, and your infrastructure agent is installed on the container’s host. Set the hostname for the container to be the hostname of the underlying server. Docker containers: Run your Docker container with the argument: --uts=\"host\" Copy This will cause the container to share the UTS Linux Namespace with the underlying host. However, by using this set, a privileged container could change the host's hostname. The application is running on a Windows container, and your infrastructure agent is installed on the Windows host. To get a direct link to infrastructure metric data for your application, enable process metrics in the infrastructure agent's configuration. Your infrastructure agent is installed, but it only reports the short hostname, not the long hostname. Configure your server's hostname settings so that the infrastructure agent and the APM agent return the exact same name string. If possible, do so by editing your server's fully qualified domain name (FQDN) settings. The APM and infrastructure agents both read their hostname from the operating system's FQDN settings, so setting the hostname there ensures both agents share a single hostname. For more information, see the Java agent troubleshooting example.",

      "body": "Apdex T is the central value for Apdex. Apdex T is the response time above which a transaction is considered \"tolerable.\" You can define Apdex T values for each application, with separate values for app server and end-user browser performance. You can also define individual Apdex T thresholds for key transactions. Important You can only change Apdex thresholds for apps that are actively reporting data. For example, if one of your apps is not reporting, you won't see its Apdex setting options. App server Apdex settings The default Apdex T threshold for an application server is 0.5 seconds. To change the default application server threshold for web transactions: Go to one.newrelic.com > (select an app) > Settings > Application > Application settings. From the Application server section, set the Apdex T value (in seconds) for this application. Select Save application settings. After you change Apdex settings, a black vertical bar appears in the main chart on the APM Summary page. End-user (Browser) Apdex settings The default Apdex T threshold for browser monitoring is 7.0 seconds. To change the default end user threshold for Apdex T: Go to one.newrelic.com > Browser > (select an app) > Settings > Application settings. From the Settings page, set the end user Apdex T value (in seconds). Select Save application settings. Key transaction Apdex settings You can set custom Apdex values for your key transactions. These values are independent of the APM and browser Apdex values for the key transaction's parent application. Key transactions will contribute to the overall Apdex score based on their own Apdex T values. The default values are inherited from the parent application. Apdex alerting You can also configure alert conditions for Apdex. When the Apdex score passes the threshold you define, New Relic sends an alert to the notification mechanism (channel). Tip For Apdex scores, set Warning (yellow) conditions higher than Critical (red) conditions for Apdex scores. This will help you monitor your customers' experience before the Apdex level falls below an unsatisfactory level.",

      "body": "In APM, you can make a transaction a key transaction when you want it to have a custom level of monitoring, or when you want it to have its own alert policy. These may be web transactions or non-web transactions that are important to your business. For most New Relic agents, a key transaction can be any type of transaction. For the PHP, Node.js, and Go agents, only web transactions can be turned into key transactions. What are key transactions? In New Relic APM, making a transaction a key transaction gives you the following benefits: Key transactions are grouped together in the New Relic UI, so they are easy to find and examine. You can set a custom Apdex threshold for a key transaction. You can set an alert policy for a key transaction. Key transactions are useful for: Important transactions. For your app's most important transactions, making them key transactions means you can quickly find and examine them. You can set stricter Apdex requirements for them, and you can create alert policies for them. Slow transactions. If a transaction is regularly slower than other transactions, it can bring down the Apdex score of the entire application. When you make a transaction a key transaction, you can set a longer-duration Apdex threshold for it so it won't bring down your app's Apdex score. Create key transactions To create key transactions, see Create and update key transactions. View key transactions in UI The key transaction's page includes response time and throughput charts, service-level agreement information, a cross application tracing map (if available), and links to alert policy options.

For the PHP, Node.js, and Go agents, only web transactions can be turned into key transactions. What are key transactions? In New Relic APM, making a transaction a key transaction gives you the following benefits: Key transactions are grouped together in the New Relic UI, so they are easy to find and examine. You can set a custom Apdex threshold for a key transaction. You can set an alert policy for a key transaction. Key transactions are useful for: Important transactions. For your app's most important transactions, making them key transactions means you can quickly find and examine them. You can set stricter Apdex requirements for them, and you can create alert policies for them. Slow transactions. If a transaction is regularly slower than other transactions, it can bring down the Apdex score of the entire application. When you make a transaction a key transaction, you can set a longer-duration Apdex threshold for it so it won't bring down your app's Apdex score. Create key transactions To create key transactions, see Create and update key transactions. View key transactions in UI The key transaction's page includes response time and throughput charts, service-level agreement information, a cross application tracing map (if available), and links to alert policy options.

      "body": "In APM, a transaction trace gives a detailed snapshot of a single transaction in your application. A transaction trace records the available function calls, database calls, and external calls. You can use transaction traces to troubleshoot performance issues and to get detailed low-level insight into how your app is working. What transactions record traces In APM, a transaction trace records the segments that make up a transaction. Because they give you more detail, you can use transaction traces to analyze and troubleshoot performance issues. Here are the default rules that govern which transactions a New Relic agent traces: Over the minute-long harvest cycle, all transactions that violate the threshold (either four times your Apdex T value or a specific number of seconds) are added to a pool of transactions. At the end of that minute, the New Relic agent selects the slowest transaction in that pool and performs a transaction trace on it. These are the general rules, but there are some agent-specific differences. For example: The Java agent collects occasional non-slow transactions. If one transaction is frequently traced, some agents will select other transactions to give a more diverse sampling. If you don't see traces in your account, it's possible that no transactions meet the necessary criteria. In this situation, you can adjust transaction trace settings to ensure some transactions will be traced. If you use Synthetic, you will likely have Synthetic monitor traces. Synthetic traces can happen more frequently than APM traces, potentially several per minute. Configure transaction traces To configure or edit trace settings, see the procedures for: Transaction traces Key transaction traces View transaction traces in UI To view transaction traces: Do one of the following: New Relic Explorer: Go to one.newrelic.com > Explorer > (select an app) > Monitor > Transactions. APM: Go to one.newrelic.com > APM > (select an app) > Monitor > Transactions. In the Transaction traces section, click transaction traces to view additional details.

Trace details page functions Go to one.newrelic.com > APM > (select an app) > Monitor > Transactions > (select a transaction trace) > Trace details. The Trace details page displays a table with the timing data for the segments in a transaction, plus additional features and functions: Trace details page Description Primary trace data, functions The top of each transaction trace UI page shows several primary pieces of data, including the trace time, response time, and, if available, CPU info. Also, sometimes the UI may indicate a partial trace. Available functions include: Delete this trace: When you delete a trace, it cannot be retrieved. Track as key transaction. Duration column The duration of each segment and subsegment is shown as both the number of milliseconds and a percentage of the total transaction time. Especially slow segments are color-coded. Segment column The Segment column displays segment names and counts. Fast and repeat calls may be automatically grouped together. Sometimes you may see Application code as the name of a segment or subsegment. To expand segments, use either of the following: The Expand performance problems button at the top of the page The expand and collapse dropdown arrows next to the segments Drilldown column The Drilldown column may contain icons that link to additional transaction data, if available. Timestamp column The Timestamp column displays the start time of a segment or subsegment, relative to the start of the transaction. For example, a value of 3.150 s indicates that that segment started 3.15 seconds into the transaction. Drilldown options In the Drilldown column, icons indicate that additional data is available: Icon Description Database queries The database icon links to the raw database query for that query segment. Depending on your transaction trace settings, this query can either show as raw data or obfuscated data. If the total time for the segment exceeds the query plan threshold in your settings, the query analysis also will appear, along with a stack trace showing the exact location of the call in your code. Stack traces The magnifying glass links to stack trace details. Aggregate transaction details This icon indicates that cross application tracing details are not available. However, you can select this icon to view aggregated transaction information across multiple invocations of the transaction. Color coding of segment duration data The Duration column of the Trace details table is color-coded: Red: More than 25% of the total transaction time was spent in this segment. Yellow: More than 5% of the total transaction time was spent in this segment. Color-coded durations do not necessarily indicate a problem. Whether the timing is actually a problem depends on what you consider normal and acceptable for your application. Application code in traces If a segment is listed as Application code in the table, it indicates that that section of code was not instrumented. You can use custom instrumentation to get more detail on that part of the code. Segments will often be listed as Application code for partial traces. Partial traces For performance reasons, New Relic APM only captures the first 2,000 segments of a transaction trace (900 for Node.js). If a transaction trace exceeds that number of segments, the agent truncates the transaction trace and displays a message at the top of the Details page: This is a partial trace. The New Relic APM agents have differing rules for when to truncate segments. APM agent Truncate segment rules C SDK Truncates based on segment priority: The root segment has the highest priority. Segments that have seen distributed tracing activity have second-highest priority. Slow segments have third-highest priority. For more information, see the C SDK's documentation about newrelic_transaction_tracer_config_t on GitHub. Go The segment duration must be greater than the TransactionTracer.SegmentThreshold value set in your Go segment configuration. Java, .NET, Ruby These agents truncate traces chronologically. For more information, see the transaction tracer documentation for Java, .NET, or Ruby as applicable. Node.js The Node.js agent only captures the first 900 segments of a transaction trace. For more information, see Node.js transaction tracer configuration. PHP Truncates based on segment duration; the slowest 2,000 segments are captured for the trace. For more information, see PHP transaction tracer configuration. Python Truncates based on segment duration; the slowest 2,000 segments are captured for the trace. For more information, see Python transaction tracer configuration. Segment grouping rules Transaction traces that have a lot of segments can be hard to interpret. New Relic helps you by automatically grouping fast and/or repeated method calls into a single segment grouping. For example, you might see a segment titled 7 fast method calls. This means that, because of their fast completion, New Relic assumed these calls were unlikely to be a problem and grouped them together. You can expand that grouping to see the individual segments. Rules underlying segment grouping include: Fast calls: When New Relic detects four or more consecutive segments with a duration of 7.5 ms or less, these are grouped into a single collapsed header. Identical calls: When New Relic detects four or more consecutive identical calls, this usually indicates an N+1 problem. These segments are collapsed. Expanding the collapsed node displays only the first three calls, not all calls.",

This indicates a good place to try to enhance your database query with an index or some other optimization. Duplicate queries Look for queries that repeatedly query the same kind of information; for example, multiple queries to look up individual account IDs. Try rewriting the query to INCLUDE the specific values (account IDs 1, 2, 10, 14, 17, etc.) so that a single query can get all the relevant items. Database overhead Look at the structure of your queries to see if there are opportunities to combine different types of information into a single call; for example, querying for the account ID, name, etc. This is useful, for example, if your database center is in a different geographical location, because this will reduce overhead. The amount of time for your database request and response may be very fast. However, by combining requests into fewer calls, you can reduce that time even more. MySQL From your app's main APM Summary page, compare the database time on the main chart to other processing time. Sudden spikes or larger amounts of database time compared to other processing times may indicate problems. Find other slow queries The Trace details page is useful for examining a specific transaction's details. To see all of your application's slowest queries in one place, use the Slow queries feature.",

You can use custom instrumentation to get more detail on that part of the code. Segments will often be listed as Application code for partial traces. Partial traces For performance reasons, New Relic APM only captures the first 2,000 segments of a transaction trace (900 for Node.js). If a transaction trace exceeds that number of segments, the agent truncates the transaction trace and displays a message at the top of the Details page: This is a partial trace. The New Relic APM agents have differing rules for when to truncate segments. APM agent Truncate segment rules C SDK Truncates based on segment priority: The root segment has the highest priority. Segments that have seen distributed tracing activity have second-highest priority. Slow segments have third-highest priority. For more information, see the C SDK's documentation about newrelic_transaction_tracer_config_t on GitHub. Go The segment duration must be greater than the TransactionTracer.SegmentThreshold value set in your Go segment configuration. Java, .NET, Ruby These agents truncate traces chronologically. For more information, see the transaction tracer documentation for Java, .NET, or Ruby as applicable. Node.js The Node.js agent only captures the first 900 segments of a transaction trace. For more information, see Node.js transaction tracer configuration. PHP Truncates based on segment duration; the slowest 2,000 segments are captured for the trace. For more information, see PHP transaction tracer configuration. Python Truncates based on segment duration; the slowest 2,000 segments are captured for the trace. For more information, see Python transaction tracer configuration. Segment grouping rules Transaction traces that have a lot of segments can be hard to interpret. New Relic helps you by automatically grouping fast and/or repeated method calls into a single segment grouping. For example, you might see a segment titled 7 fast method calls. This means that, because of their fast completion, New Relic assumed these calls were unlikely to be a problem and grouped them together. You can expand that grouping to see the individual segments. Rules underlying segment grouping include: Fast calls: When New Relic detects four or more consecutive segments with a duration of 7.5 ms or less, these are grouped into a single collapsed header. Identical calls: When New Relic detects four or more consecutive identical calls, this usually indicates an N+1 problem. These segments are collapsed. Expanding the collapsed node displays only the first three calls, not all calls.",

Because they collect detailed data from your app, transaction traces can be a potential security concern. This document explains how to configure transaction traces for your data security needs. Database queries The database query types collected by transaction traces vary by New Relic language agent. Query collection is a potential security and/or privacy concern because queries can contain sensitive values. You can customize database query collection with three different security settings: Obfuscated: This is the default value. This setting strips string literals and numeric sequences from your queries and replaces them with the ? character. For example: the query select * from table where ssn='123-45-6789' would become select * from table where ssn=?. Off: Query collection is turned off entirely. Raw: If you are confident that full query data collection will not impact your data security or your users' privacy, you can change the setting to Raw, which will record all query values. You can edit database query collection with the Record SQL setting, explained in Configure transaction traces. HTTP request attributes and parameters The collection of HTTP request data can expose potentially sensitive data. New Relic calls the key/value data collected during an HTTP request attributes. By default, the collection of attributes is limited to only basic HTTP information that is not a source of sensitive data (for example, response code and host); these are part of the group of basic attributes that New Relic refers to as agent attributes. For data security reasons, the collection of other attributes, including user-specific parameters, is disabled by default. For information on how to enable/disable the collection of specific HTTP attributes and custom attributes, see Configure transaction traces. High security mode New Relic's default settings provide a high level of security. To force the most secure settings for all the applications in your account, you can use the high security mode. This mode ensures that, no matter how your admins and users configure your account, the most secure settings are forced and cannot be overridden. For more information, see High security mode.",

      "body": "In APM, a transaction trace gives a detailed snapshot of a single transaction in your application. A transaction trace records the available function calls, database calls, and external calls. You can use transaction traces to troubleshoot performance issues and to get detailed low-level insight into how your app is working. What transactions record traces In APM, a transaction trace records the segments that make up a transaction. Because they give you more detail, you can use transaction traces to analyze and troubleshoot performance issues. Here are the default rules that govern which transactions a New Relic agent traces: Over the minute-long harvest cycle, all transactions that violate the threshold (either four times your Apdex T value or a specific number of seconds) are added to a pool of transactions. At the end of that minute, the New Relic agent selects the slowest transaction in that pool and performs a transaction trace on it. These are the general rules, but there are some agent-specific differences. For example: The Java agent collects occasional non-slow transactions. If one transaction is frequently traced, some agents will select other transactions to give a more diverse sampling. If you don't see traces in your account, it's possible that no transactions meet the necessary criteria. In this situation, you can adjust transaction trace settings to ensure some transactions will be traced. If you use Synthetic, you will likely have Synthetic monitor traces. Synthetic traces can happen more frequently than APM traces, potentially several per minute. Configure transaction traces To configure or edit trace settings, see the procedures for: Transaction traces Key transaction traces View transaction traces in UI To view transaction traces: Do one of the following: New Relic Explorer: Go to one.newrelic.com > Explorer > (select an app) > Monitor > Transactions. APM: Go to one.newrelic.com > APM > (select an app) > Monitor > Transactions. In the Transaction traces section, click transaction traces to view additional details.

For more information, see PHP transaction tracer configuration. Python Truncates based on segment duration; the slowest 2,000 segments are captured for the trace. For more information, see Python transaction tracer configuration. Segment grouping rules Transaction traces that have a lot of segments can be hard to interpret. New Relic helps you by automatically grouping fast and/or repeated method calls into a single segment grouping. For example, you might see a segment titled 7 fast method calls. This means that, because of their fast completion, New Relic assumed these calls were unlikely to be a problem and grouped them together. You can expand that grouping to see the individual segments. Rules underlying segment grouping include: Fast calls: When New Relic detects four or more consecutive segments with a duration of 7.5 ms or less, these are grouped into a single collapsed header. Identical calls: When New Relic detects four or more consecutive identical calls, this usually indicates an N+1 problem. These segments are collapsed. Expanding the collapsed node displays only the first three calls, not all calls.",

Configure database query settings You can change database query settings in the same way you change other transaction trace settings; for example, via configuring the New Relic agent or, for some agents, via the UI. Common database query setting changes include: Collecting raw query data instead of obfuscated or turning off query collection Changing the stack trace threshold Turning on query explain plan collection Use database queries to improve performance Here are some tips to improve your app's database performance: Use database queries Comments Time Look for queries where the TOTAL DURATION contributes large amounts of time to the overall transaction time. This indicates a good place to try to enhance your database query with an index or some other optimization. Duplicate queries Look for queries that repeatedly query the same kind of information; for example, multiple queries to look up individual account IDs. Try rewriting the query to INCLUDE the specific values (account IDs 1, 2, 10, 14, 17, etc.) so that a single query can get all the relevant items. Database overhead Look at the structure of your queries to see if there are opportunities to combine different types of information into a single call; for example, querying for the account ID, name, etc. This is useful, for example, if your database center is in a different geographical location, because this will reduce overhead. The amount of time for your database request and response may be very fast. However, by combining requests into fewer calls, you can reduce that time even more. MySQL From your app's main APM Summary page, compare the database time on the main chart to other processing time. Sudden spikes or larger amounts of database time compared to other processing times may indicate problems. Find other slow queries The Trace details page is useful for examining a specific transaction's details. To see all of your application's slowest queries in one place, use the Slow queries feature.",

Trace details page functions Go to one.newrelic.com > APM > (select an app) > Monitor > Transactions > (select a transaction trace) > Trace details. The Trace details page displays a table with the timing data for the segments in a transaction, plus additional features and functions: Trace details page Description Primary trace data, functions The top of each transaction trace UI page shows several primary pieces of data, including the trace time, response time, and, if available, CPU info. Also, sometimes the UI may indicate a partial trace. Available functions include: Delete this trace: When you delete a trace, it cannot be retrieved. Track as key transaction. Duration column The duration of each segment and subsegment is shown as both the number of milliseconds and a percentage of the total transaction time. Especially slow segments are color-coded. Segment column The Segment column displays segment names and counts. Fast and repeat calls may be automatically grouped together. Sometimes you may see Application code as the name of a segment or subsegment. To expand segments, use either of the following: The Expand performance problems button at the top of the page The expand and collapse dropdown arrows next to the segments Drilldown column The Drilldown column may contain icons that link to additional transaction data, if available. Timestamp column The Timestamp column displays the start time of a segment or subsegment, relative to the start of the transaction. For example, a value of 3.150 s indicates that that segment started 3.15 seconds into the transaction. Drilldown options In the Drilldown column, icons indicate that additional data is available: Icon Description Database queries The database icon links to the raw database query for that query segment. Depending on your transaction trace settings, this query can either show as raw data or obfuscated data. If the total time for the segment exceeds the query plan threshold in your settings, the query analysis also will appear, along with a stack trace showing the exact location of the call in your code. Stack traces The magnifying glass links to stack trace details. Aggregate transaction details This icon indicates that cross application tracing details are not available. However, you can select this icon to view aggregated transaction information across multiple invocations of the transaction. Color coding of segment duration data The Duration column of the Trace details table is color-coded: Red: More than 25% of the total transaction time was spent in this segment. Yellow: More than 5% of the total transaction time was spent in this segment. Color-coded durations do not necessarily indicate a problem. Whether the timing is actually a problem depends on what you consider normal and acceptable for your application. Application code in traces If a segment is listed as Application code in the table, it indicates that that section of code was not instrumented. You can use custom instrumentation to get more detail on that part of the code. Segments will often be listed as Application code for partial traces. Partial traces For performance reasons, New Relic APM only captures the first 2,000 segments of a transaction trace (900 for Node.js). If a transaction trace exceeds that number of segments, the agent truncates the transaction trace and displays a message at the top of the Details page: This is a partial trace. The New Relic APM agents have differing rules for when to truncate segments. APM agent Truncate segment rules C SDK Truncates based on segment priority: The root segment has the highest priority. Segments that have seen distributed tracing activity have second-highest priority. Slow segments have third-highest priority. For more information, see the C SDK's documentation about newrelic_transaction_tracer_config_t on GitHub. Go The segment duration must be greater than the TransactionTracer.SegmentThreshold value set in your Go segment configuration. Java, .NET, Ruby These agents truncate traces chronologically. For more information, see the transaction tracer documentation for Java, .NET, or Ruby as applicable. Node.js The Node.js agent only captures the first 900 segments of a transaction trace. For more information, see Node.js transaction tracer configuration. PHP Truncates based on segment duration; the slowest 2,000 segments are captured for the trace. For more information, see PHP transaction tracer configuration. Python Truncates based on segment duration; the slowest 2,000 segments are captured for the trace. For more information, see Python transaction tracer configuration. Segment grouping rules Transaction traces that have a lot of segments can be hard to interpret.

This means that, because of their fast completion, New Relic assumed these calls were unlikely to be a problem and grouped them together. You can expand that grouping to see the individual segments.

Identical calls: When New Relic detects four or more consecutive identical calls, this usually indicates an N+1 problem. These segments are collapsed. Expanding the collapsed node displays only the first three calls, not all calls.",

Because they collect detailed data from your app, transaction traces can be a potential security concern. This document explains how to configure transaction traces for your data security needs. Database queries The database query types collected by transaction traces vary by New Relic language agent. Query collection is a potential security and/or privacy concern because queries can contain sensitive values. You can customize database query collection with three different security settings: Obfuscated: This is the default value. This setting strips string literals and numeric sequences from your queries and replaces them with the ? character. For example: the query select * from table where ssn='123-45-6789' would become select * from table where ssn=?. Off: Query collection is turned off entirely. Raw: If you are confident that full query data collection will not impact your data security or your users' privacy, you can change the setting to Raw, which will record all query values. You can edit database query collection with the Record SQL setting, explained in Configure transaction traces. HTTP request attributes and parameters The collection of HTTP request data can expose potentially sensitive data. New Relic calls the key/value data collected during an HTTP request attributes. By default, the collection of attributes is limited to only basic HTTP information that is not a source of sensitive data (for example, response code and host); these are part of the group of basic attributes that New Relic refers to as agent attributes. For data security reasons, the collection of other attributes, including user-specific parameters, is disabled by default. For information on how to enable/disable the collection of specific HTTP attributes and custom attributes, see Configure transaction traces. High security mode New Relic's default settings provide a high level of security. To force the most secure settings for all the applications in your account, you can use the high security mode. This mode ensures that, no matter how your admins and users configure your account, the most secure settings are forced and cannot be overridden. For more information, see High security mode.",

Trace details page functions Go to one.newrelic.com > APM > (select an app) > Monitor > Transactions > (select a transaction trace) > Trace details. The Trace details page displays a table with the timing data for the segments in a transaction, plus additional features and functions: Trace details page Description Primary trace data, functions The top of each transaction trace UI page shows several primary pieces of data, including the trace time, response time, and, if available, CPU info. Also, sometimes the UI may indicate a partial trace. Available functions include: Delete this trace: When you delete a trace, it cannot be retrieved. Track as key transaction. Duration column The duration of each segment and subsegment is shown as both the number of milliseconds and a percentage of the total transaction time. Especially slow segments are color-coded. Segment column The Segment column displays segment names and counts. Fast and repeat calls may be automatically grouped together. Sometimes you may see Application code as the name of a segment or subsegment. To expand segments, use either of the following: The Expand performance problems button at the top of the page The expand and collapse dropdown arrows next to the segments Drilldown column The Drilldown column may contain icons that link to additional transaction data, if available. Timestamp column The Timestamp column displays the start time of a segment or subsegment, relative to the start of the transaction. For example, a value of 3.150 s indicates that that segment started 3.15 seconds into the transaction. Drilldown options In the Drilldown column, icons indicate that additional data is available: Icon Description Database queries The database icon links to the raw database query for that query segment. Depending on your transaction trace settings, this query can either show as raw data or obfuscated data. If the total time for the segment exceeds the query plan threshold in your settings, the query analysis also will appear, along with a stack trace showing the exact location of the call in your code. Stack traces The magnifying glass links to stack trace details. Aggregate transaction details This icon indicates that cross application tracing details are not available. However, you can select this icon to view aggregated transaction information across multiple invocations of the transaction. Color coding of segment duration data The Duration column of the Trace details table is color-coded: Red: More than 25% of the total transaction time was spent in this segment. Yellow: More than 5% of the total transaction time was spent in this segment. Color-coded durations do not necessarily indicate a problem. Whether the timing is actually a problem depends on what you consider normal and acceptable for your application. Application code in traces If a segment is listed as Application code in the table, it indicates that that section of code was not instrumented. You can use custom instrumentation to get more detail on that part of the code. Segments will often be listed as Application code for partial traces. Partial traces For performance reasons, New Relic APM only captures the first 2,000 segments of a transaction trace (900 for Node.js). If a transaction trace exceeds that number of segments, the agent truncates the transaction trace and displays a message at the top of the Details page: This is a partial trace. The New Relic APM agents have differing rules for when to truncate segments. APM agent Truncate segment rules C SDK Truncates based on segment priority: The root segment has the highest priority. Segments that have seen distributed tracing activity have second-highest priority. Slow segments have third-highest priority. For more information, see the C SDK's documentation about newrelic_transaction_tracer_config_t on GitHub. Go The segment duration must be greater than the TransactionTracer.SegmentThreshold value set in your Go segment configuration. Java, .NET, Ruby These agents truncate traces chronologically. For more information, see the transaction tracer documentation for Java, .NET, or Ruby as applicable. Node.js The Node.js agent only captures the first 900 segments of a transaction trace. For more information, see Node.js transaction tracer configuration. PHP Truncates based on segment duration; the slowest 2,000 segments are captured for the trace. For more information, see PHP transaction tracer configuration. Python Truncates based on segment duration; the slowest 2,000 segments are captured for the trace. For more information, see Python transaction tracer configuration. Segment grouping rules Transaction traces that have a lot of segments can be hard to interpret. New Relic helps you by automatically grouping fast and/or repeated method calls into a single segment grouping. For example, you might see a segment titled 7 fast method calls. This means that, because of their fast completion, New Relic assumed these calls were unlikely to be a problem and grouped them together. You can expand that grouping to see the individual segments. Rules underlying segment grouping include: Fast calls: When New Relic detects four or more consecutive segments with a duration of 7.5 ms or less, these are grouped into a single collapsed header. Identical calls: When New Relic detects four or more consecutive identical calls, this usually indicates an N+1 problem. These segments are collapsed. Expanding the collapsed node displays only the first three calls, not all calls.",

A transaction trace records the available function calls, database calls, and external calls. You can use transaction traces to troubleshoot performance issues and to get detailed low-level insight into how your app is working. What transactions record traces In APM, a transaction trace records the segments that make up a transaction. Because they give you more detail, you can use transaction traces to analyze and troubleshoot performance issues. Here are the default rules that govern which transactions a New Relic agent traces: Over the minute-long harvest cycle, all transactions that violate the threshold (either four times your Apdex T value or a specific number of seconds) are added to a pool of transactions.

These are the general rules, but there are some agent-specific differences. For example: The Java agent collects occasional non-slow transactions. If one transaction is frequently traced, some agents will select other transactions to give a more diverse sampling. If you don't see traces in your account, it's possible that no transactions meet the necessary criteria. In this situation, you can adjust transaction trace settings to ensure some transactions will be traced. If you use Synthetic, you will likely have Synthetic monitor traces.

Because they collect detailed data from your app, transaction traces can be a potential security concern. This document explains how to configure transaction traces for your data security needs. Database queries The database query types collected by transaction traces vary by New Relic language agent. Query collection is a potential security and/or privacy concern because queries can contain sensitive values. You can customize database query collection with three different security settings: Obfuscated: This is the default value. This setting strips string literals and numeric sequences from your queries and replaces them with the ? character. For example: the query select * from table where ssn='123-45-6789' would become select * from table where ssn=?. Off: Query collection is turned off entirely. Raw: If you are confident that full query data collection will not impact your data security or your users' privacy, you can change the setting to Raw, which will record all query values. You can edit database query collection with the Record SQL setting, explained in Configure transaction traces. HTTP request attributes and parameters The collection of HTTP request data can expose potentially sensitive data. New Relic calls the key/value data collected during an HTTP request attributes. By default, the collection of attributes is limited to only basic HTTP information that is not a source of sensitive data (for example, response code and host); these are part of the group of basic attributes that New Relic refers to as agent attributes. For data security reasons, the collection of other attributes, including user-specific parameters, is disabled by default. For information on how to enable/disable the collection of specific HTTP attributes and custom attributes, see Configure transaction traces. High security mode New Relic's default settings provide a high level of security. To force the most secure settings for all the applications in your account, you can use the high security mode. This mode ensures that, no matter how your admins and users configure your account, the most secure settings are forced and cannot be overridden. For more information, see High security mode.",

Trace details page functions Go to one.newrelic.com > APM > (select an app) > Monitor > Transactions > (select a transaction trace) > Trace details. The Trace details page displays a table with the timing data for the segments in a transaction, plus additional features and functions: Trace details page Description Primary trace data, functions The top of each transaction trace UI page shows several primary pieces of data, including the trace time, response time, and, if available, CPU info. Also, sometimes the UI may indicate a partial trace. Available functions include: Delete this trace: When you delete a trace, it cannot be retrieved. Track as key transaction. Duration column The duration of each segment and subsegment is shown as both the number of milliseconds and a percentage of the total transaction time. Especially slow segments are color-coded. Segment column The Segment column displays segment names and counts. Fast and repeat calls may be automatically grouped together. Sometimes you may see Application code as the name of a segment or subsegment. To expand segments, use either of the following: The Expand performance problems button at the top of the page The expand and collapse dropdown arrows next to the segments Drilldown column The Drilldown column may contain icons that link to additional transaction data, if available. Timestamp column The Timestamp column displays the start time of a segment or subsegment, relative to the start of the transaction. For example, a value of 3.150 s indicates that that segment started 3.15 seconds into the transaction. Drilldown options In the Drilldown column, icons indicate that additional data is available: Icon Description Database queries The database icon links to the raw database query for that query segment. Depending on your transaction trace settings, this query can either show as raw data or obfuscated data. If the total time for the segment exceeds the query plan threshold in your settings, the query analysis also will appear, along with a stack trace showing the exact location of the call in your code. Stack traces The magnifying glass links to stack trace details. Aggregate transaction details This icon indicates that cross application tracing details are not available. However, you can select this icon to view aggregated transaction information across multiple invocations of the transaction. Color coding of segment duration data The Duration column of the Trace details table is color-coded: Red: More than 25% of the total transaction time was spent in this segment. Yellow: More than 5% of the total transaction time was spent in this segment. Color-coded durations do not necessarily indicate a problem. Whether the timing is actually a problem depends on what you consider normal and acceptable for your application. Application code in traces If a segment is listed as Application code in the table, it indicates that that section of code was not instrumented. You can use custom instrumentation to get more detail on that part of the code. Segments will often be listed as Application code for partial traces. Partial traces For performance reasons, New Relic APM only captures the first 2,000 segments of a transaction trace (900 for Node.js). If a transaction trace exceeds that number of segments, the agent truncates the transaction trace and displays a message at the top of the Details page: This is a partial trace. The New Relic APM agents have differing rules for when to truncate segments. APM agent Truncate segment rules C SDK Truncates based on segment priority: The root segment has the highest priority. Segments that have seen distributed tracing activity have second-highest priority. Slow segments have third-highest priority. For more information, see the C SDK's documentation about newrelic_transaction_tracer_config_t on GitHub. Go The segment duration must be greater than the TransactionTracer.SegmentThreshold value set in your Go segment configuration. Java, .NET, Ruby These agents truncate traces chronologically. For more information, see the transaction tracer documentation for Java, .NET, or Ruby as applicable. Node.js The Node.js agent only captures the first 900 segments of a transaction trace. For more information, see Node.js transaction tracer configuration. PHP Truncates based on segment duration; the slowest 2,000 segments are captured for the trace. For more information, see PHP transaction tracer configuration. Python Truncates based on segment duration; the slowest 2,000 segments are captured for the trace. For more information, see Python transaction tracer configuration. Segment grouping rules Transaction traces that have a lot of segments can be hard to interpret. New Relic helps you by automatically grouping fast and/or repeated method calls into a single segment grouping. For example, you might see a segment titled 7 fast method calls. This means that, because of their fast completion, New Relic assumed these calls were unlikely to be a problem and grouped them together. You can expand that grouping to see the individual segments. Rules underlying segment grouping include: Fast calls: When New Relic detects four or more consecutive segments with a duration of 7.5 ms or less, these are grouped into a single collapsed header. Identical calls: When New Relic detects four or more consecutive identical calls, this usually indicates an N+1 problem. These segments are collapsed. Expanding the collapsed node displays only the first three calls, not all calls.",

Configure database query settings You can change database query settings in the same way you change other transaction trace settings; for example, via configuring the New Relic agent or, for some agents, via the UI. Common database query setting changes include: Collecting raw query data instead of obfuscated or turning off query collection Changing the stack trace threshold Turning on query explain plan collection Use database queries to improve performance Here are some tips to improve your app's database performance: Use database queries Comments Time Look for queries where the TOTAL DURATION contributes large amounts of time to the overall transaction time. This indicates a good place to try to enhance your database query with an index or some other optimization. Duplicate queries Look for queries that repeatedly query the same kind of information; for example, multiple queries to look up individual account IDs. Try rewriting the query to INCLUDE the specific values (account IDs 1, 2, 10, 14, 17, etc.) so that a single query can get all the relevant items. Database overhead Look at the structure of your queries to see if there are opportunities to combine different types of information into a single call; for example, querying for the account ID, name, etc. This is useful, for example, if your database center is in a different geographical location, because this will reduce overhead. The amount of time for your database request and response may be very fast. However, by combining requests into fewer calls, you can reduce that time even more. MySQL From your app's main APM Summary page, compare the database time on the main chart to other processing time. Sudden spikes or larger amounts of database time compared to other processing times may indicate problems. Find other slow queries The Trace details page is useful for examining a specific transaction's details. To see all of your application's slowest queries in one place, use the Slow queries feature.",

      "body": "When we say auto-telemetry, we’re not talking about cars — we're talking about instant baseline visibility into your Kubernetes clusters. With the New Relic One integration with Pixie, you get similar data to traditional language agents, but without manually instrumenting your code or redeploying your application. Pixie auto-telemetry is powered by eBPF, a virtual machine-like construct that enables Pixie to seamlessly collect fine-grained telemetry data — service-level metrics, unsampled requests, and more. With one install command, you get deeper insight into your Kubernetes clusters and workloads. No language agents required. Live debugging with Pixie shows a service graph listing the namespaces and the node that are available on the current cluster. Simply put, Auto-telemetry with Pixie offers the quickest option for getting observability into your Kubernetes services. Quickly start observing and debugging Kubernetes clusters Our Pixie integration gives you the best of both worlds: Pixie’s fast and simple Kubernetes observability coupled with New Relic One’s incident correlation, intelligent alerting, and long-term retention. You’ll get visibility into HTTP services using golden signals, HTTP transactions, database transactions, distributed tracing, and JVM metrics. You can operate, debug, and scale your Kubernetes clusters based on the information you learn about how your clusters and services are running. Using the New Relic Explorer, you can see key metrics and events at every level, starting with the cluster, and diving down into namespaces, deployments, and pods. You can quickly spot anomalous behavior, and where it’s happening. And then dive deeper using embedded visualizations of your Pixie data. Quickly identify hot spots with Flamegraph. On the Live debugging with Pixie tab, answer questions like what SQL requests your app is making or which services are talking to each other. Important Auto-Telemetry with Pixie leverages Community Cloud with Pixie, a separate platform from New Relic One. Use of Community Cloud with Pixie is subject to separate terms of service. Install Auto-telemetry with Pixie Use our guided installation process to install Auto-telemetry with Pixie. This deploys Pixie with New Relic's Kubernetes integration on your cluster. You don't need to do any further configuration or installation to start using Pixie. If you want to install Auto-telemetry with Pixie on multiple clusters, re-run the guided install for each additional cluster. Before you begin Review this Pixie data security overview for actions to take to secure your data. Make sure you have sufficient memory: Pixie requires 2Gb of memory per node in your cluster. Review the other Pixie technical requirements. You must be a full user. Other user-related requirements: For users on original user model: cannot be a Restricted User. For users on New Relic One user model: must be assigned to a group that has a role with Pixie-related capabilities. Important If you are already a Pixie user, you must still install using the guided installation steps described below. This will provide the API keys that you need. Install from the beginning of the guided install process Open our New Relic One guided install. Select the account you want to use for the guided install, and click Continue. Note: if you have a single account, you won't see this option. Select Kubernetes and then continue with step one in the next section. Install from the Configure the HELM command/manifest (yaml) file If you arrived in the guided installation process by following a link from Pixie or from within New Relic, your steps begin here. Select the account and cluster for the install. If needed, select a namespace. Important Currently, Pixie performs best on clusters with up to 100 nodes (exceeding 100 nodes can lead to excessive memory usage and scripts failing to run). Friendly reminder: autoscaling can quickly drive up your node numbers. Click Continue. Select the data you want to gather, observe, and debug, and click Continue. On the Choose install method page, select either Helm or manifest. Helm method Copy the Helm command that's provided, and then run it on your command line. See this page about installing the Kubernetes integration using Helm to learn more about the process. Helm installs a bundle containing the New Relic infrastructure agent, an integration to gather Prometheus metrics and Kubernetes events, and the Pixie integration. The deployment takes a few minutes to complete. To see the status of the install to the cluster, run kubectl get pods -n newrelic. manifest method Run the provided command in your console, and insert the path to your downloaded manifest. If you're running your Kubernetes cluster in the cloud, see the additional steps in the Kubernetes docs. Click Continue to open the Listening for data page. When you get the message, See your data, click Kubernetes Cluster Explorer to see your cluster. Auto-telemetry with Pixie might restart after installation. This is caused by the auto update feature. Explore your cluster In the cluster explorer, you can get a quick overview of the nodes in your cluster, including CPU, memory, and storage, as well as the status of each pod (healthy, warning, or critical). You can also find out what services are running in each container, their latency, throughput, and error rate. For more information about using the cluster explorer, see Navigate the Kubernetes cluster explorer. Tip Containers might be listed for up to four hours after they get decommissioned. You can query the Pixie data in New Relic One and create dashboards for at-a-glance monitoring. Find the data model and sample queries here. Investigate usage spikes with Flamegraph Debugging is orders of magnitude easier when you can quickly see what your application is doing. Flamegraph, a Pixie always-on visualization, requires no instrumentation, redeploying, or recompiling. It works for compiled languages like Go, C+, Rust, to name a few. And at a glance, Flamegraph tells you what functions your application is spending time on and where you have hot spots. Flamegraph is especially useful for hierarchical resource use, like disk usage and CPU utilization. For more information on how to read Flamegraph, see the Pixie documentation. Debug live On the Live debugging with Pixie tab, run PxL scripts — scripts written in Pixie's PxL language — to view live data captured through eBPF. Select the script drop-down and then select a script to run in the tab. (For best results, select a time range that is recent in the time picker.) Scripts enable you to debug: Traffic in multiple formats: HTTP and HTTPs (including encrypted), DNS, Postgres, MySQL, Cassandra, Redis (currently supporting SQL and HTTP in beta).

Auto-telemetry with Pixie therefore benefits from Pixie's approach to keeping data secure. The data that Pixie collects is stored entirely within your Kubernetes cluster. This data does not persist outside of your environment, and will never be stored by Community Cloud for Pixie. This means that your sensitive data remains within your environment and control. Community Cloud for Pixie makes queries directly to your Kubernetes cluster to access the data. In order for the query results to be shown in the Community Cloud for Pixie UI, CLI, and API, the data is sent to the client from your cluster using a reverse proxy. Community Cloud for Pixie’s reverse proxy is designed to ensure: Data is ephemeral. It only passes through the Community Cloud for Pixie's cloud proxy in transit. This ensures data locality. Data is encrypted while in transit. Only you are able to read your data. New Relic One fetches and stores data that related to an application's performance. With Auto-telemetry with Pixie, a predefined subset of data persists outside of your cluster. This data is stored in Telemetry Data Platform, in the your selected region. This data persists in order to give you long-term storage, alerting, correlation with additional data, and the ability to use advanced New Relic platform capabilities, such as anomaly detection. The persisted performance metrics include, but are not limited to: Golden metrics (throughput, latency, error rate) for HTTP-based services HTTP transaction data Database transaction data (for MySQL & PostgreSQL) Distributed tracing JVM metrics The data you view on the Live debugging tab comes through Community Cloud for Pixie, and is therefore potentially sensitive. It is not stored by New Relic and is ephemeral and queryable for less than 24 hours. Control who has access to Pixie data If you want to manage which members of your organization can view Pixie data in New Relic One, as well as install and delete Pixie links, you can create a custom role. Note that this option is available only to Enterprise and Pro level customers. For more information, see New Relic's user model. Manage auto-update and two-way communication Pixie maintains an active two-way communication channel from your host system to Community Cloud with Pixie at withpixie.ai. Pixie uses this communication channel to query data, push updates, and retrieve metadata and health checks about Pixie and your Kubernetes cluster. By default, Pixie queries withpixie.ai to check if new updates have been pushed and then automatically installs them if they’re present.

      "body": "Auto-telemetry with Pixie is New Relic One's integration of Community Cloud for Pixie, a managed version of Pixie open source software. Auto-telemetry with Pixie therefore benefits from Pixie's approach to keeping data secure. The data that Pixie collects is stored entirely within your Kubernetes cluster. This data does not persist outside of your environment, and will never be stored by Community Cloud for Pixie. This means that your sensitive data remains within your environment and control. Community Cloud for Pixie makes queries directly to your Kubernetes cluster to access the data. In order for the query results to be shown in the Community Cloud for Pixie UI, CLI, and API, the data is sent to the client from your cluster using a reverse proxy. Community Cloud for Pixie’s reverse proxy is designed to ensure: Data is ephemeral. It only passes through the Community Cloud for Pixie's cloud proxy in transit. This ensures data locality. Data is encrypted while in transit. Only you are able to read your data. New Relic One fetches and stores data that related to an application's performance. With Auto-telemetry with Pixie, a predefined subset of data persists outside of your cluster. This data is stored in Telemetry Data Platform, in the your selected region. This data persists in order to give you long-term storage, alerting, correlation with additional data, and the ability to use advanced New Relic platform capabilities, such as anomaly detection. The persisted performance metrics include, but are not limited to: Golden metrics (throughput, latency, error rate) for HTTP-based services HTTP transaction data Database transaction data (for MySQL & PostgreSQL) Distributed tracing JVM metrics The data you view on the Live debugging tab comes through Community Cloud for Pixie, and is therefore potentially sensitive. It is not stored by New Relic and is ephemeral and queryable for less than 24 hours. Control who has access to Pixie data If you want to manage which members of your organization can view Pixie data in New Relic One, as well as install and delete Pixie links, you can create a custom role. Note that this option is available only to Enterprise and Pro level customers. For more information, see New Relic's user model. Manage auto-update and two-way communication Pixie maintains an active two-way communication channel from your host system to Community Cloud with Pixie at withpixie.ai. Pixie uses this communication channel to query data, push updates, and retrieve metadata and health checks about Pixie and your Kubernetes cluster. By default, Pixie queries withpixie.ai to check if new updates have been pushed and then automatically installs them if they’re present. To disable auto updates, you must set a flag prior to the install process using either Helm or in the newrelic-manifest.yaml file. To disable automatic updates, choose one: Helm option Add --set pixie-chart.disableAutoUpdate=true to your Helm command. newrelic-manifest.yaml option in your newrelic-manifest.yaml file under the pl-cluster-config section, add PL_DISABLE_AUTO_UPDATE: \"true\" to the data directive.

      "body": "When we say auto-telemetry, we’re not talking about cars — we're talking about instant baseline visibility into your Kubernetes clusters. With the New Relic One integration with Pixie, you get similar data to traditional language agents, but without manually instrumenting your code or redeploying your application. Pixie auto-telemetry is powered by eBPF, a virtual machine-like construct that enables Pixie to seamlessly collect fine-grained telemetry data — service-level metrics, unsampled requests, and more. With one install command, you get deeper insight into your Kubernetes clusters and workloads. No language agents required. Live debugging with Pixie shows a service graph listing the namespaces and the node that are available on the current cluster. Simply put, Auto-telemetry with Pixie offers the quickest option for getting observability into your Kubernetes services. Quickly start observing and debugging Kubernetes clusters Our Pixie integration gives you the best of both worlds: Pixie’s fast and simple Kubernetes observability coupled with New Relic One’s incident correlation, intelligent alerting, and long-term retention. You’ll get visibility into HTTP services using golden signals, HTTP transactions, database transactions, distributed tracing, and JVM metrics. You can operate, debug, and scale your Kubernetes clusters based on the information you learn about how your clusters and services are running. Using the New Relic Explorer, you can see key metrics and events at every level, starting with the cluster, and diving down into namespaces, deployments, and pods. You can quickly spot anomalous behavior, and where it’s happening. And then dive deeper using embedded visualizations of your Pixie data. Quickly identify hot spots with Flamegraph. On the Live debugging with Pixie tab, answer questions like what SQL requests your app is making or which services are talking to each other. Important Auto-Telemetry with Pixie leverages Community Cloud with Pixie, a separate platform from New Relic One. Use of Community Cloud with Pixie is subject to separate terms of service. Install Auto-telemetry with Pixie Use our guided installation process to install Auto-telemetry with Pixie. This deploys Pixie with New Relic's Kubernetes integration on your cluster. You don't need to do any further configuration or installation to start using Pixie. If you want to install Auto-telemetry with Pixie on multiple clusters, re-run the guided install for each additional cluster. Before you begin Review this Pixie data security overview for actions to take to secure your data. Make sure you have sufficient memory: Pixie requires 2Gb of memory per node in your cluster. Review the other Pixie technical requirements. You must be a full user. Other user-related requirements: For users on original user model: cannot be a Restricted User. For users on New Relic One user model: must be assigned to a group that has a role with Pixie-related capabilities. Important If you are already a Pixie user, you must still install using the guided installation steps described below. This will provide the API keys that you need. Install from the beginning of the guided install process Open our New Relic One guided install. Select the account you want to use for the guided install, and click Continue. Note: if you have a single account, you won't see this option. Select Kubernetes and then continue with step one in the next section. Install from the Configure the HELM command/manifest (yaml) file If you arrived in the guided installation process by following a link from Pixie or from within New Relic, your steps begin here. Select the account and cluster for the install. If needed, select a namespace. Important Currently, Pixie performs best on clusters with up to 100 nodes (exceeding 100 nodes can lead to excessive memory usage and scripts failing to run). Friendly reminder: autoscaling can quickly drive up your node numbers. Click Continue. Select the data you want to gather, observe, and debug, and click Continue. On the Choose install method page, select either Helm or manifest. Helm method Copy the Helm command that's provided, and then run it on your command line. See this page about installing the Kubernetes integration using Helm to learn more about the process. Helm installs a bundle containing the New Relic infrastructure agent, an integration to gather Prometheus metrics and Kubernetes events, and the Pixie integration. The deployment takes a few minutes to complete. To see the status of the install to the cluster, run kubectl get pods -n newrelic. manifest method Run the provided command in your console, and insert the path to your downloaded manifest. If you're running your Kubernetes cluster in the cloud, see the additional steps in the Kubernetes docs. Click Continue to open the Listening for data page. When you get the message, See your data, click Kubernetes Cluster Explorer to see your cluster. Auto-telemetry with Pixie might restart after installation. This is caused by the auto update feature. Explore your cluster In the cluster explorer, you can get a quick overview of the nodes in your cluster, including CPU, memory, and storage, as well as the status of each pod (healthy, warning, or critical). You can also find out what services are running in each container, their latency, throughput, and error rate. For more information about using the cluster explorer, see Navigate the Kubernetes cluster explorer. Tip Containers might be listed for up to four hours after they get decommissioned. You can query the Pixie data in New Relic One and create dashboards for at-a-glance monitoring. Find the data model and sample queries here. Investigate usage spikes with Flamegraph Debugging is orders of magnitude easier when you can quickly see what your application is doing. Flamegraph, a Pixie always-on visualization, requires no instrumentation, redeploying, or recompiling. It works for compiled languages like Go, C+, Rust, to name a few. And at a glance, Flamegraph tells you what functions your application is spending time on and where you have hot spots. Flamegraph is especially useful for hierarchical resource use, like disk usage and CPU utilization. For more information on how to read Flamegraph, see the Pixie documentation. Debug live On the Live debugging with Pixie tab, run PxL scripts — scripts written in Pixie's PxL language — to view live data captured through eBPF. Select the script drop-down and then select a script to run in the tab. (For best results, select a time range that is recent in the time picker.) Scripts enable you to debug: Traffic in multiple formats: HTTP and HTTPs (including encrypted), DNS, Postgres, MySQL, Cassandra, Redis (currently supporting SQL and HTTP in beta). Learn more: Request tracing tutorial. Database request performance. Learn more: Database Query Profiling tutorial. Service maps to learn which services are talking to each other. Learn more: Service Performance tutorial. Network traffic maps to learn which nodes are talking to each other. Learn more: Network Monitoring tutorial. Monitor resource usage by Node and Pod. Learn more: Infra health tutorial. If you don't find the script you need, you can write your own PxL scripts. Find more information about available scripts in Pixie's open source repo.",

Read on for more information about our page types. Docs meta content (frontmatter) Thr top of every doc begins with a set of metadata. Read on for more information about this metadata content: Meta content field Description Title Whenever possible, provide an action-oriented or task-oriented title; for example, \"AJAX page: Identify time-consuming calls.\" In general, use sentence case. Capitalize only the first word. Do not capitalize any other word in the title unless it's a proper noun, such as a specific product name, or it follows a colon (:). If you're looking for ideas on how to choose a title, browse the titles of similar docs. The title used in the sidebar (left navigation pane) is set in the nav file. type For the basicDoc template, use page or omit type. If omitted, the default type is page and the basicDoc template is used. template The template determines the basic layout and style of a page. Use basicDoc for more pages. tags Keywords related to your doc. Start each topic with a _* on a new line. A topic can include multiple words separated by spaces. japaneseVersion The URL to the Japanese language version of the doc. Leave this blank if there isn't a Japanese version. watermark Watermarks are customizible text backgrounds that indicate something special about a page. They look like large, faded text behind the doc's content. We used to insert watermarks in beta docs, but now we insert a custom callout. Here are some other examples of watermarks: Legacy, Deprecated, and NR ONLY). Document body The document body is where you edit the page content. Use the GitHub Markdown format when you write content. Page templates For most situations, use the basicDoc page template. Read on for information about our other page templates. Content type Description Basic page A standard HTML webpage without special fields. This content type is used for the majority of content on the site. API doc This format is for API reference documentation. For more information, see apiStyleGuidelines (for style guidelines) and Work with the API doc content type (for how to use and configure). Attribute definition This format is for defining attributes and event types. These definitions are shared with the UI via the data dictionary service. For more information, see Work with attribute definition content type. Landing pages This format is for a more user-friendly and readable landing page, which replaces the standard taxonomy list views. For more information, see Working with landing pages. Release notes This format includes specific fields for release notes. Users rely on release notes to keep up with smaller changes in the product, particularly for downloadble software like the agents. For more information, see Create release notes. What's New posts This format includes specific fields for product announcements. What's New posts are created by PMM for larger announcements. They're available in the docs site, but they're also visible in the New Relic One UI. For more information, see What's New style guidelines.

DistributedTraceSummary MobileRequest MobileRequestError Span Transaction TransactionError InfrastructureEvent Data sources : InfrastructureCloudTrail InfrastructureEvent describes changes (deltas) that occur in a system's live state. When an inventory or system state is added, removed, or changed, Infrastructure will produce an InfrastructureEvent that logs that activity. Attribute name Definition Data types category A New Relic category used to organize events in the UI. For example: automation, notification, and service. InfrastructureEvent changeType A simple classification of the type of change made to the entity: added, modified, or removed. InfrastructureEvent changedPath The fully specified name of the item that changed. This is constructed by taking the source and adding one or more additional path elements that uniquely identify the item that changed. InfrastructureEvent deltaId Delta refers to a recorded change in the system. The deltaId is a number used by New Relic to organize incoming inventory change data. InfrastructureEvent eventId The unique ID of the event, generated by New Relic. InfrastructureEvent format The type of infrastructure event. Each format type includes attributes that may be used to render the event in the UI. InfrastructureEvent newStatus The new agent status: disconnected or connected. InfrastructureEvent newValue If a change is made to the entity, this attribute contains the new value of the inventory that was changed. This will have no value if no change has been made. The value will display approximately 4K bytes of data. InfrastructureEvent oldValue If a change is made to the entity, this attribute contains the old value of the inventory that was changed. This will be blank if no change has been made. InfrastructureEvent provider For integrations that use generic event types (like the DatastoreSample event), the provider value specifies the source of the data (the service, or a sub-category of data from that service). Some Insights events are generic and are used by several integrations. For example, the DatastoreSample event is used by several integrations, including the AWS DynamoDB integration and the AWS RDS integration. In these cases, the provider attribute value represents the source of that attribute. This will usually be the service that data comes from or, for integrations that use several provider values, a certain sub-category of data from that service. When a provider value is present for a generic event, that event will have additional integration-specific attributes attached to it. Here’s an example of an Insights NRQL query that returns the attributes present for a DatastoreSample event reported by the AWS RDS integration: SELECT * from DatastoreSample where provider = 'RdsDbCluster' InfrastructureEvent source The fully specified origin of this inventory item. This is typically in the form category/plugin, where plugin is the generic word used for the tool that gathered this data. InfrastructureEvent summary A summary of the change that happened.

      "body": "Browser monitoring's session traces provide a detailed timeline of the load and interaction events during a webpage's full life cycle, for as long as ten minutes. Page load timing, individual asset loads, user interactions, AJAX requests, callbacks, errors, and other events appear in an interactive timeline which includes a detailed waterfall visualization, a heat map overview, and highlighted metrics and problems related to that session. Identify problems and solutions Session traces help you understand: How users experience your page load, including time to DOM load, time waiting for AJAX requests to complete, and the user's interactions with the page How the New Relic metrics reflect your end users' experiences What is the sequence of JavaScript and browser events, which take longer than others, and when each event occurs Where bottlenecks occur, and what may be causing them Why one page load may be slower than others, by providing the context for individual events during a session By connecting performance to user experience and interactions to performance, this detailed and intuitive visualization of all events in the user's session can help pinpoint problem areas and easily identify solutions. Requirements To use browser session traces feature, make sure you meet these requirements: Requires the Pro or Pro+SPA agent type Your agent version must support browser monitoring. If you're using multiple names for an app, session traces will only report to the most specific application. Browser randomly captures traces only from browsers that support the Resource Timing API. Select a session trace The Session traces index lists the most recent traces based on the time picker selection for the selected app. Session traces are randomly sampled and stored at a rate of 90/hour. You can page through up to 500 traces at a time. Additionally, you can sort and search the list by attributes, including: Full URL, with query string parameters removed Browser type Started at date/time Page load time one.newrelic.com > Browser > (select an app) > Session traces: You can select a session trace from the browser index. You can also select a session trace directly from the browser Summary, Page views, JS errors, and AJAX pages. To select a specific session trace: Go to one.newrelic.com and click Browser > (select an app) > Session traces. To locate a session trace from a different date or time period, use the time picker. To limit the index to a specific type of trace, use the search window. To view detailed information, select the session trace's link. Tip You can also select a session trace directly from the Browser Summary, Page views, JS errors and AJAX pages. View session trace details The Session trace details page provides summary information about the trace, a heat map with timing details, and a waterfall of events that you can explore. The color-coded legend identifies the page load events during the webpage's life cycle. For apps that have been deployed using the copy/paste method, browser monitoring includes web app and queue time in Network time as part of the page load timing process. This is because browser relies on the server-side agent to pass the application values to the browser agent through auto-injection. You can view detailed information about how this \"back end\" time breaks down from the browser's point of view. The session traces report on all the network related events available, so you can see on a case-by-case basis how the browser spends time on DNS lookups and other network events. one.newrelic.com > Browser > (select an app) > Session traces > (select a trace): Use Browser's session trace details to examine events and identify problems during the end user's webpage session. To navigate through a session trace, explore the waterfall chart by scrolling vertically through the event stack, or select individual events to view their details. If you want to... Do this... View the web page for this session trace Select the trace link. Jump to a specific time Select the time indicator or event on the heat map. View details about individual events Select any event in the waterfall chart. From there, select View full details if applicable. Change the location on the session trace Click on the heat map, or scroll vertically through the waterfall chart. Zoom in or out of the overall trace Select the plus or minus icons below the heat map. Share the session trace information Create a permalink to paste into a form, ticket, email, etc. Session segment definitions Important session trace measurements are displayed in the upper right corner of the Session traces page. The first four measurements represent how long into a session that the segment ended. For example, if Page Load is 0.202s, that means that the page load event completed 0.202 seconds after the request began. Session segment Description Backend The time from when the request began to when backend activity finished and DOM loading began. DOM processing The time from when the request began to when DOM processing finished. Page load The time from when the request began to when the page load event fired. Waiting on AJAX The time from when the request began to when AJAX activity ended. First interaction The time from when the request began to when the first user activity, like a mouse click or a scroll, was recorded. Duration The total duration of the session. Slow JavaScript execution and repainting Session traces help you identify callbacks in your JavaScript code that execute slowly and block the execution of subsequent calls on the browser's main thread. These calls should execute quickly in order to allow the browser to quickly repaint the page in response to user actions. Session traces highlight any callbacks longer than 33ms. If called in rapid succession (such as inside a requestAnimationFrame loop), callbacks longer than 33ms reduce the frame rate below 30 frames per second. This speed seems sluggish to users.",

      "body": "Your end-user experience depends on your entire technology stack. You need to quickly understand what's causing a customer complaint or issue. Did the problem come from your infrastructure, your application, or the browsers that ultimately render it? Is it the result of a problematic internet provider, a problem in your own data center with failing CPU or memory, or something else? More than Real User Monitoring (RUM) Many websites contain dynamic content that is loaded after the initial page has finished loading, and complex JavaScript code increases the need for error reporting. Browser monitoring in New Relic One provides a Real User Monitoring (RUM) solution that measures the speed and performance of your end users as they navigate to your site from different web browsers, devices, operating systems, and networks. With browser monitoring in New Relic One, you see actionable data about your end users' experience with your app. But browser monitoring in New Relic goes far beyond the initial page load to measure full page life cycle data. For example, our browser UI shows you: Actual performance data, such as by page view popularity and user satisfaction (Apdex) scores Perceived performance data that measures how quickly your async or dynamic visuals and interactive page contents display JavaScript error analytics, stack traces, and line-of-code visibility, to show you the end-user steps leading up to an error itself Session performance with a detailed timeline and heat map of the load and interaction events during a webpage's full life cycle AJAX requests indicating problems with timing, end points, and specific locations in the webpage Hash-based route changes in apps with single-page application (SPA) architectures These tools (and more!) help your teams optimize your end users' page load experience, eliminate bugs, and troubleshoot faster across your full stack. Examine user perceptions Real user data gives insights into actual page performance, but you also need to look into your users' perception of your site's performance. Pages can load content in many different ways, and users control when they interact with that content. This is why some user-centric performance metrics happen outside the standard window onload (page load time) in the browser monitoring agent. The PageViewTiming event provides a more real-time delivery mechanism that does not have a dependency on any other event. Additional metrics include: First paint, first contentful paint, and largest contentful paint First input delay First interaction This helps you understand how users experience your site, both from visual and responsiveness standpoints. Improve interactive app performance Our single-page app (SPA) monitoring automatically tracks route changes, initial page loads, and synchronous and asynchronous activity during browser interactions. You can also use our browser agent and SPA API to monitor virtually anything that executes inside the browser. If you are a developer, SPA monitoring can help you: Create faster, more responsive, highly interactive apps. Monitor the throughput and performance that real users are experiencing. Troubleshoot and resolve problems within the context of the page load. Query and visualize the data to assist with business decisions. Bring better apps to the marketplace more quickly. Correlate front-end and back-end problems With New Relic One, you can instrument any type of data you need, such as metrics, events, logs, and traces. This helps you find actionable data about your end users' experience across the stack. For example: Full-Stack Observability Comments Locations or domains Limit browser monitoring to focus on specific geographical locations or specific types of end-user activity. You can also monitor or block specific domains. Trends in interactions Use our comparative charting feature for a direct page load time comparison between real user (browser) interactions and trends appearing in Synthetic monitors. Distributed tracing Isolate latency from the web browser through back-end services with distributed tracing. The UI helps you see the connection across across a full transaction, from browser activity, to time spent in network, to back-end activity. Browser types Explore your end users' experience with your app segmented by any types of browsers they use, including: Top browsers by throughput Average page load time by platform type (mobile, desktop, and other) Selected browser type by version (for example, Chrome 31, 32, 33, etc.) This helps you quickly determine whether problems with page load timing may be related to a specific browser type or platform, or whether the problem is more widespread. Get started with browser monitoring Follow these basic steps, and you'll quickly be up and running in New Relic with browser monitoring! Review the compatibility details and basic requirements for browser monitoring. Install the browser agent. Go to [one.newrelic.com > Explorer > Browser applications. Use the Explorer to access all your entities, that is, anything we can identify that reports data, from applications and hosts to custom groupings of any elements. View summary data from your Browser summary page, then drill down into page load timing details and other UI data. Configure your alerts for key performance data, or use our Applied Intelligence solutions to reduce alert noise, correlate incidents, and automatically detect anomalies. Query and visualize your default data (or customize your own), then analyze what that data says about your business. Customize and share your own charts and dashboards.",

      "body": "Browser monitoring's JavaScript snippet introduces a nearly invisible impact on website performance and user perception of the time it takes a page to load. The JavaScript is included in a packet of webpage data that is sent anyway. In addition, it immediately begins monitoring for errors and events as the rest of the webpage executes. The negligible amount of overhead required to load the JavaScript results in a significant return of actionable data. Contents Overall impact The JavaScript's overhead takes into consideration both the impact on the user and the impact on your systems' performance: User perception: Typically users cannot detect performance degradations on a website of less than 200ms. Browser's JavaScript adds less than 15ms in aggregated time per page load. This is split up over time, so at no point would a user be able to perceive any performance impact due to the JavaScript. Webserver and systems: Browser app monitoring occurs on the user's browser, not on the server. Processing time does not have an impact on your CPU consumption. In addition, we take additional steps to minimize any potential impact on the apps and webpages being monitored. For example, the \"loader\" script is loaded synchronously in the <HEAD> in order to ensure monitoring is enabled for the entire life cycle of the page. This script is included inline, which eliminates the need for another roundtrip network request to a content delivery network (CDN). The \"loader\" comes with the initial page load. Later in the life cycle of the page, New Relic loads an additional monitoring script asynchronously. This script should not have any perceivable effect to the user and is included in the overall overhead of less than 15ms per page. Network impact Browser monitoring also minimizes network traffic for the end user by aggregating data locally (in the client) and sending it back to New Relic on load, at periodic intervals, on unload, or when data has been collected. (During the browser session's idle periods, transmissions may not be required.)

      "body": "Browser monitoring provides insights into how your application or site behaves when it is loaded in a web browser. Browser only records performance data, as explained in this document. It does not record any data used or stored by the monitored application unless you explicitly configure it to do so. For more information about New Relic's security measures, see our security and privacy documentation, or visit the New Relic security website. Reported data Browser reports many different types of data to help you analyze your website's performance. It only reports page view data, unless you have subscribed to Pro features. You can also enable functionality for AJAX requests, JavaScript errors, and session traces. For most data types, browser transmits the data securely using HTTPS encryption. The browser agent transmits data to New Relic's collectors by using either of the domains bam.nr-data.net or bam-cell.nr-data.net. Here is a summary of the types of data reported by browser monitoring. Page view data This data is reported once per page view and consists of: Page load timing data Name of the server-side app controller that served the page, if available (obfuscated in the page and during transmission) Additional custom parameters set by the server-side app controller, if available (obfuscated in the page and during transmission) Additional custom parameters set by the browser agent API, if set prior to page load This information appears on the Page views page. For data security reasons, browser does not record or collect URL query strings. Server-side data can only be collected when the host is also instrumented by New Relic and the browser monitoring instrumentation is injected by the agent. For more information about how we collect and present this data, see Instrumentation for page load timing. AJAX timing data When enabled, browser periodically reports AJAX timing data until the user navigates away from or closes the page. (New Relic automatically filters out all AJAX requests that take longer than two minutes.) Data includes: Hostnames, ports, and paths (but not search/query parameters) of AJAX request URLs HTTP status code of responses Byte size of request message bodies Name of the server-side app controller servicing the AJAX request and server-side timing data (obfuscated in the page and during transmission), when the browser instrumentation is injected by the New Relic agent Timing data for the AJAX transaction Timing data for the AJAX callbacks This information appears on the AJAX page. JavaScript error data When enabled, browser periodically reports data about every error that occurs on the page until the user navigates away from or closes the page. This information appears on the JavaScript errors page. For each error, the data includes: Exception class of the error Error message containing arbitrary text Stack trace of the error, which may contain function names and URLs of scripts causing the error Error messages typically do not contain any confidential or sensitive information. However, it is possible for messages to be purposefully constructed with sensitive information. Before enabling JavaScript error reporting, ensure that your website does not expose any sensitive information in error messages. Session trace data When enabled, browser periodically reports data on the details of the a single page's life cycle, including user interactions, AJAX loads, and JavaScript errors, until the user navigates away from or closes the page. New Relic automatically stops recording further data after ten minutes. Data includes: Asset load timing details User interactions such as scrolling, mousing, and clicking JavaScript error timing and other JavaScript error information Triggered Javascript events Session traces are captured randomly at a fixed rate from among the monitored page views. Session trace information appears on the Session traces page. SPA data If you use browser's single-page app (SPA) monitoring, New Relic reports the following data once per page load or route change. Browser data for page views, AJAX timing, JavaScript errors, and session traces Hash fragments associated with SPA route changes Additional custom parameters added from the SPA API When SPA monitoring has been enabled, this information appears on the Page views page. Server-side data can only be collected when the host is also instrumented by New Relic, and the browser monitoring instrumentation is injected by the agent. For more information about how we collect and present this data, see Instrumentation for page load timing. URL query strings The browser agent uses the HTTP referer attribute to track page URLs. URLs can sometimes contain potentially sensitive user-entered query data (for example, a user's name). For data security reasons, browser does not record or collect URL query strings. Visitor's IP address Browser uses the visitor's IP address to enrich data for additional visitor segmentation. Details such as the ASN and geoID are mapped to browser data from the IP address. For data security reasons, browser does not retain the visitor's IP address for reporting. The IP address is obtained in the HTTP header from the request to the New Relic collector. New Relic does not retain the visitor's IP address after the attributes have been mapped. The IP address value is overwritten within 24 hours of data being collected. Browser types Browser determines the browser type from the User-Agent header and the geographical location based on the browser's IP address. New Relic does not retain the IP address, only the country and region associated with the performance data. This information appears on the selected app's Geography page. Also, details about specific browser types appear on the selected app's Browsers page. CDN access Page load timing requires access to the content delivery network (CDN), where New Relic's utility JavaScript file (nr.js) is hosted. The domain name for the file (js-agent.newrelic.com) remains static, but the number in the path (version) may change periodically. A script tag is injected by the New Relic agent (or pasted into the webpage for standalone apps) that references the JavaScript on the CDN, which is then loaded by the browser. The loaded JavaScript collects and reports the metrics dynamically to either of the domains bam.nr-data.net or bam-cell.nr-data.net. Important If your end users are behind a firewall or proxy and do not have access to the CDN or to New Relic's networks (including bam.nr-data.net and bam-cell.nr-data.net), browser monitoring will not work. Cookies Browser monitoring creates cookies in the end user's browser. If the user has cookies disabled, page load timing (sometimes referred to as real user monitoring or RUM) will not be able to track sessions properly. Also, if the user has an older browser that does not support the Navigation Timing Specification API, page load timing will not be able to track response times as accurately. New Relic's cookies generated by browser agents older than version 995 may not contain the secure attribute. This is because page load timing data transmission in versions before version 995 use HTTP when the page is HTTP, but use HTTPS when the page is HTTPS. All browser agent versions above version 995 will always use the secure flag for cookies and transmit over HTTPS. JavaScript and AJAX data may contain more sensitive information, so they are always transmitted over HTTPS. Transmission of these cookies using HTTP or access to them from JavaScript is not a significant security risk, because the cookies are not used to make security decisions or allow access to an account. They are used only to collect performance data, with any identifiable data obfuscated. For customers subject to special guidelines for cookie collection, such as those under the EU GDPR/PECR ICO Guidelines, we now provide the option to disable cookie collection for your application. Please see our browser agent v1169 release notes for more information. Important If your site uses P3P, it must be configured to allow these cookies. JSONP requests Page load timing metrics are reported to New Relic using a Script GET, also known as a JSONP request. The Script GET returns a value that is subsequently stored in a cookie and used to trigger trace capturing.",

      "body": "Browser monitoring supports the uploading of source maps, which are used to un-minify error stack traces on the JS errors page. This document explains how to use the API to publish (upload) source maps to browser. Prepare for using the source map API In order to upload source maps to browser via the API, you'll need this information: A user API key (before November 20, 2020, the Admin API key was required; that will still work if already in place) The New Relic application ID for the deployed app The full JavaScript file URL Optionally, if the JavaScript URL doesn't automatically have release info appended to it, the release name and ID What is the JavaScript URL? Every time the agent captures an error in your code, it's associated with the URL of the JavaScript in which it occurred. This is the src attribute of the script tag in your HTML. This full JavaScript URL is required when sending source maps to browser. You can find the URL for an error's JavaScript file in browser, on the JS errors page. See Browser monitoring source maps for more on finding these errors in the UI. Is a release name and ID required? Many organizations include a version number or hash in the JavaScript URL. This is generally added to \"bust\" caches to ensure your users get the most recent version of your code. This type of URL might look something like: https://example.com/assets/application-59.min.js https://example.com/assets/bundle-d6d031.min.js https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/jquery/3.1.1/jquery.js If your app's URLs automatically have the version info appended to it, the browser agent has everything it needs in order to match errors with your code. You can move ahead to generating source maps. If this doesn't apply to you, and JS URLs do not have version info appended, you’ll have to assist the agent by specifying a release name and ID with the API. Are there limits to source map uploads? There is no limit to the overall number of source maps you can upload. However, the API is rate-limited: You can upload a maximum of 100 source maps per minute You can upload a maximum of 5,000 source maps per day Source map files can be a maximum of 50Mb in size. Push source maps to New Relic Now that you have one or more source maps, you are ready to publish it to browser. You can use any of these methods to send source maps to browser: Use the New Relic npm module with the API via the command line or via a client-side JavaScript build/deploy script like Gulp or Grunt. Use API curl commands. Use the browser UI. Use npm module via command line or client-side script The easiest and recommended way to upload source maps to browser is to use the our new @newrelic/publish-sourcemap npm module. It provides a command line tool and Javascript API to accomplish this task. More documentation is available in the npm repo. Here are some examples of using the npm module via the command line. Important The following examples are for US accounts. For EU accounts, the endpoint is https://sourcemaps.service.eu.newrelic.com. For more information, see Introduction to the EU region data center. npm command line: Publish Here's an example of uploading source maps using the npm module via the command line. Note that the source map can come from a local file or a remote URL. npm install -g @newrelic/publish-sourcemap publish-sourcemap PATH_TO_SOURCE_MAP_FILE (local or remote) PATH_TO_ORIGINAL_FILE --apiKey=YOUR_NEW_RELIC_USER_API_KEY --applicationId=YOUR_NEW_RELIC_APP_ID Copy npm command line: List published maps Here's an example of listing published source maps: list-sourcemaps --applicationId=YOUR_APP_ID --apiKey=YOUR_NEW_RELIC_USER_KEY Options: --applicationId Browser application id --apiKey New Relic user API key Copy npm command line: Delete Here's an example of deleting a source map: delete-sourcemap --applicationId=YOUR_APP_ID --apiKey=YOUR_NEW_RELIC_USER_API_KEY --sourcemapId=YOUR_SOURCE_MAP_ID Options: --applicationId Browser application id --apiKey New Relic user API key --sourcemapId Unique id generated for a source map Copy Here are some examples of using the npm module to publish from client-side JavaScript: npm via Node.js script: Publish Here's an example of publishing a source map via a Node.js script: var publishSourcemap = require(‘@newrelic/publish-sourcemap’).publishSourcemap publishSourcemap({ sourcemapPath: 'SOURCE_MAP_FULL_PATH', javascriptUrl: 'JS_URL', applicationId: YOUR_NEW_RELIC_APP_ID, apiKey: 'YOUR_NEW_RELIC_USER_API_KEY' }, function (err) { console.log(err || 'Sourcemap upload done')}) Copy npm via Node.js script: List published maps Here's an example of listing all published source maps: var listSourcemaps = require(‘@newrelic/publish-sourcemap’).listSourcemaps listSourcemaps({ sourcemapPath: 'SOURCE_MAP_FULL_PATH', javascriptUrl: 'JS_URL', applicationId: YOUR_NEW_RELIC_APP_ID, apiKey: 'YOUR_NEW_RELIC_USER_API_KEY', }, function (err, res) { console.log(err || res.body)}) Copy npm via Node.js script: Delete Here's an example of deleting a source map file via a Node.js script: var deleteSourcemap = require(‘@newrelic/publish-sourcemap’).deleteSourcemap deleteSourcemap({ sourcemapId: 'SOURCE_MAP_ID', applicationId: YOUR_NEW_RELIC_APP_ID, apiKey: 'YOUR_NEW_RELIC_USER_API_KEY', }, function (err) { console.log(err || 'Deleted source map')}) Copy When you're done, go to the JS errors page in browser, select an error grouping, and see if your error stack traces have been un-minified. Use API via curl Below are some examples of using curl to publish, list, and delete source maps: curl: Upload maps An example of using API via curl to publish maps to browser: curl -H \"Api-Key: YOUR_NEW_RELIC_USER_API_KEY\" \\ -F \"sourcemap=@SOURCE_MAP_PATH\" \\ -F \"javascriptUrl=JS_URL\" \\ -F \"releaseId=YOUR_RELEASE_ID\" \\ -F \"releaseName=YOUR_UI_PAGE\" \\ https://sourcemaps.service.newrelic.com/v2/applications/YOUR_NEW_RELIC_APP_ID/sourcemaps Copy curl: List existing maps Below is an example of how to get a list of source maps previously uploaded to New Relic via curl. New Relic returns the source map's unique SOURCEMAP_ID and its components: curl \\ -H \"Api-Key: YOUR_NEW_RELIC_USER_API_KEY\" \\ https://sourcemaps.service.newrelic.com/v2/applications/YOUR_NEW_RELIC_APP_ID/sourcemaps Copy curl: Delete map To delete a source map: Use the GET endpoint to list existing source maps and locate the SOURCEMAP_ID. Run the following command via curl: curl -X DELETE \\ -H \"Api-Key: YOUR_NEW_RELIC_USER_API_KEY\" \\ https://sourcemaps.service.newrelic.com/v2/applications/YOUR_NEW_RELIC_APP_ID/sourcemaps/SOURCEMAP_ID Copy When you're done, go to the JS errors page in browser, select an error grouping, and see if your error stack traces have been un-minified. Troubleshoot source maps If you are having trouble generating source maps from your build system, or if your errors in browser are remaining minified, see the source maps troubleshooting documentation.",

      "body": "By default, mobile monitoring enables crash reporting for your mobile applications to help track and diagnose crashes. When an Android application crashes, the agent uploads a crash report to the New Relic collector. The crash details will then be processed and de-obfuscated automatically if you are using ProGuard or DexGuard. You can view detailed information about crashes in the Crash analysis UI, or receive crash notifications by email. You can also explore the crash data deeper with New Relic Insights, or integrate with ticketing systems for further investigation. Upload the ProGuard or DexGuard file The Android agent supports ProGuard and DexGuard. DexGuard is an extension to ProGuard, and it behaves the same as ProGuard when dealing with crash symbolication and obfuscated code maps. ProGuard obfuscates your code by renaming classes, fields, and methods with semantically obscure labels. DexGuard adds another additional layer of obfuscation and security, but otherwise behaves identically to ProGuard. If ProGuard or DexGuard is enabled, the stack trace produced by a crash consists only of these obfuscated labels, which are not human-readable. Follow the SDK installation or upgrade instructions to configure ProGuard or DexGuard and enable crash reporting. Be sure to create the newrelic.properties file containing your application token. Use mapping.txt file The agent uses the mapping.txt file produced during a ProGuard/DexGuard-enabled build. This file consists of the obfuscated label names, and provides reverse mapping between obfuscated and plain text labels. You must use the copy of mapping.txt generated during the build that produced your final application. The application's build ID changes each time an APK is generated, and the build ID in the mapping file must match the ID contained in each uploaded crash report. After you create a newrelic.properties file containing your New Relic app token in your project, the ProGuard or DexGuard mapping.txt file will be uploaded automatically after each build. Exception If either of the following situations occur, you must manually upload the mapping.txt replacement file: If the mapping.txt file is renamed using the DexGuard -printmapping option, the Android agent will be unable to locate or upload the stripped names. If you see obfuscated crash reports in the Crashes page, you may not have a mapping.txt file uploaded. Map Processing Important Agent version 5.27.0 introduces changes to the way the agent plugin process maps during builds. Maps are reported for select variant builds The agent will tag and report only those mapping.txt files generated by Release build-type variants. This behavior can be configured or disabled through the New Relic Gradle Plugin extension. Variants are assigned unique build IDs During an execution of a Gradle build, a single unique ID (build ID) was generated to represent all variants of the app built during that invocation. This often led to mismatched crash reports for customers using variants to customize a common app code base. Each variant is now identified by its own unique ID, which is used when reporting the variant's ProGuard map to New Relic. You can disable this behavior through the New Relic Gradle Plugin extension. Compress maps prior to upload As apps get larger, so do their associated maps, which then results in longer upload times when reporting the map. If map reporting time is unreasonably long, the agent can compress the map prior to transfer. To enable compressed map uploads, add the following to your app's newrelic.properties file: com.newrelic.compressed_uploads=true Copy Deferred crash reporting Important Agent version 6.0.0 introduces changes to the way the agent plugin processes crashes at runtime. In an attempt to address crash report duplication, deferred crash reporting is now the default crash reporting behavior. In this case, crash reports are recorded when they occur, but they're not uploaded until the next application launch. The previous crash reporting behavior is still available: uploading the crash as soon as it occurs before the application process terminates. You can use the NewRelic.withCrashReportingEnabled(boolean) API method. For example: NewRelic .withApplicationToken(\"<appToken>\") .withCrashReportingEnabled(true) .start(this.getApplication()); Copy Disable crash reporting If you want to use another crash reporting tool, you can disable crash reporting by calling NewRelic.disableFeature(FeatureFlag.CrashReporting) prior to agent initialization. For example: NewRelic.disableFeature(FeatureFlag.CrashReporting); NewRelic .withApplicationToken(\"<appToken>\") .start(this.getApplication()); Copy Debug the crash reporter Crash reporting for Android is designed to work with other crash reporting frameworks by chaining the uncaught exception handler if it is already registered. If no other framework has been found (or if New Relic is the first framework registered), the debug logs will include: Installing New Relic crash handler. Copy If another handler is already registered, debug logs will include: Installing New Relic crash handler and chaining previous exception handler. Copy Every time New Relic catches an exception, it is logged to DEBUG level. For example: A crash has been detected in <className>. Copy If New Relic catches an exception but crash reporting has been disabled for any reason, this message is logged: A crash has been detected but crash reporting is disabled. Copy If you don't see crash reports, check the debug logs for messages like this. Manually upload a ProGuard or DexGuard map file In some unusual circumstances, it may not be possible to automatically upload the ProGuard or DexGuard mapping file. This is often due to incorrectly creating a newrelic.properties file containing your application token. This will result in build errors or warnings with detailed log messages. To manually upload a ProGuard or DexGuard map file: Find the mapping.txt file(s) in the project's build directory For example, the file is located in the <PROJECT_ROOT>/app/build/outputs/mapping/<BUILD_VARIANT> directory for projects that use Android Studio. Generally, a release variant is used when building the final version of the application. The following command is useful for finding map files: find <project_root> -name mapping.txt Copy Using a command terminal, upload the ProGuard or DexGuard mapping file: For a US account: curl -v -F upload=@\"<mapping.txt>\" -H \"X-APP-LICENSE-KEY:<APPLICATION_TOKEN>\" https://mobile-symbol-upload.newrelic.com/symbol Copy For a EU account: curl -v -F upload=@\"<mapping.txt>\" -H \"X-APP-LICENSE-KEY:<APPLICATION_TOKEN>\" https://mobile-symbol-upload.eu.newrelic.com/symbol Copy Replace the following in your command: <mapping.txt> is the full path to the ProGuard or DexGuard mapping.txt file. <APPLICATION_TOKEN> is your mobile monitoring application token.",

Before you install the browser agent, make sure your system meets these requirements. Want to try out our browser monitoring? Create a New Relic account for free! No credit card required. Basic requirements To report data to browser, your application must at a minimum meet two basic requirements: The traffic to the application must be from clients able to load and execute browser JavaScript code and set cookies. Clients accessing the application must be able to send data to New Relic through HTTP requests. HTTPS is required for browser Pro features. Important Browsers that subscribe to a disconnect list or that use content filtering extensions such as AdBlock may not be able to send data to New Relic. For example, if you are using the Enhanced Tracking Prevention disconnect list for Mozilla Firefox 69.0 or higher, you will need to change the default configuration. Most typical browser applications meet these requirements. However, browser applications in restricted environments may have difficulty reporting data to New Relic; for example: Hybrid mobile applications Applications installed on unusual hardware, such as point-of-sale terminals or consumer appliances For more information, review the instrumentation for browser monitoring documentation, and verify end-user network access. Browser types Instrumentation is compatible with every browser type, including Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox, Microsoft Internet Explorer and Edge, and Apple Safari. The user interface is compatible with New Relic's supported browser versions. Exceptions Comments Paint timings The firstPaint and firstContentfulPaint attributes in BrowserInteraction, PageView, and PageViewTiming events are only compatible with: Chrome 60 or higher for desktop and mobile (Android webview and Chrome for Android) Opera 47 or higher for desktop Opera 44 or higher for Android mobile Samsung Internet for mobile AJAX AJAX timing features are not available with: Chrome for iPhone and iPad IE 7 and 8 PageAction events PageAction events require a browser that fully supports cross-domain XMLHttpRequests. Internet Explorer versions 9 and lower cannot record PageAction events. Learn more on querying your data. Session traces Session traces are reported only from browsers that support the Resource Timing Specification. SHA-256 New Relic can only monitor browsers that are compatible with SHA-256. APM agents You can deploy the browser agent for apps monitored by APM, or you can deploy the browser agent for your standalone apps. For more information, see the installation procedures. If you are deploying browser for an app using APM, make sure your agent supports browser monitoring: C SDK: Version 1.0.0 or higher Go: Version 2.5.0 or higher Java: Version 3.4.0 or higher .NET: Version 2.20.25.0 or higher Node.js: Version 1.4.0 or higher PHP: Version 4.4.5.35 or higher Python: Version 2.10.1.9 or higher Ruby: Version 3.7.0.177 or higher Supported frameworks The browser agent collects data on all front-end frameworks. However, the monitoring occurs on lower-level \"primitives\" that JavaScript frameworks use, so the level of detail collected by the instrumentation may vary depending on your specific framework. Exceptions Comments Zone.js If you're using AngularJS and you want to use our SPA monitoring features, note that Zone.js versions 0.6.18 to 0.6.24 are not compatible with browser. In all cases, the browser agent must be loaded before Zone.js to avoid errors. Cypress.io Browser is unable to properly instrument the open and send methods of requests when tests are run in Cypress. This will cause the following error to be thrown: Cannot set property 'status' of undefined Copy This will only affect customers running tests with the Browser agent present in their code. Production applications should not be affected. html2pdf.js This library is not compatible with our Pro+SPA agent due to the way this library wraps promises. If you're using this library, we recommend selecting the Pro agent type. Content Security Policy (CSP) considerations In order to obtain accurate browser performance metrics, browser requires the use of a small, inline JavaScript snippet. New Relic carefully reviews the inline JavaScript to prevent Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) and other potential vulnerabilities. Content Security Policy Level 2 adds restrictions to the types of JavaScript allowed, such as inline scripts. It also limits which domains can load scripts during page load. Important If your website does not allow any third-party hosted JavaScript to run, you must request a CSP exception via your organization’s standard procedures in order to install the browser monitoring agent. When requesting a CSP exception, follow your organization's standard procedures to contact your web or security team. The browser JavaScript agent requires the following CSP exceptions in order to run properly. Alternatively, you can add all of these exceptions to the fallback default-src directive (instead of script-src and connect-src). CSP exception Comments unsafe-inline Add to the script-src directive or to the fallback default-src directive. This is required because the agent is installed by including an inline script. https://js-agent.newrelic.com Add to the script-src directive or to the fallback default-src directive. This is where additional script files that the agent requires are hosted. https://bam.nr-data.net https://bam-cell.nr-data.net Important Add https://gov-bam.nr-data.net if you're using FedRAMP-compliant endpoints. Add to the script-src directive or to the fallback default-src directive. This is where the agent sends its collected data. One of the calls to this URL is a JSONP call, which means that the URL must be allowed as a script source. Add to the connect-src directive or to the fallback default-src directive. The connect-src directive affects the URLs that scripts can call (for example, using the XMLHttpRequest interface). If you have CSP restrictions specifically around this directive, then add this URL as an exception.",

Based on the data retention schedule, New Relic will retain historical data collected under the old name, and will collect and aggregate data under the new name. If one or more apps share the same name, then their data will be aggregated in the UI. Caution If you change the app identifier, a new application will appear in our user interface with the new name, and data will stop reporting to the app(s) with the old name. Rename app via JavaScript snippet This information applies if you inserted the browser agent's JavaScript snippet into your: App monitored by APM that was deployed via the copy/paste method Single page app (SPA) Any standalone browser app that is not also monitored by APM You cannot directly edit the JavaScript snippet in the existing app. Instead, to use your app with a different name: Follow standard procedures to create a new app using the copy/paste method. Provide the new name, and generate the JavaScript snippet. Copy the new JavaScript snippet. In your webpage, replace the JavaScript from your original app with the JavaScript generated for the new app name. If your standalone app has multiple names, copy the custom app IDs in your configuration script to your new app. Based on the data retention schedule, New Relic will retain historical data collected under the old name, and will collect and aggregate data under the new name. Rename app via New Relic REST API (v2) This information applies only to browser apps that are also monitored by APM. You cannot change the app name via the REST API if you used the copy/paste method to insert browser's JavaScript snippet into your app. Follow standard procedures to change the APM app alias via REST API or API Explorer. New Relic automatically changes the display name for the app everywhere in the New Relic UI, including browser.",

Before you install the browser agent, make sure your system meets these requirements. Want to try out our browser monitoring? Create a New Relic account for free! No credit card required. Basic requirements To report data to browser, your application must at a minimum meet two basic requirements: The traffic to the application must be from clients able to load and execute browser JavaScript code and set cookies. Clients accessing the application must be able to send data to New Relic through HTTP requests. HTTPS is required for browser Pro features. Important Browsers that subscribe to a disconnect list or that use content filtering extensions such as AdBlock may not be able to send data to New Relic. For example, if you are using the Enhanced Tracking Prevention disconnect list for Mozilla Firefox 69.0 or higher, you will need to change the default configuration. Most typical browser applications meet these requirements. However, browser applications in restricted environments may have difficulty reporting data to New Relic; for example: Hybrid mobile applications Applications installed on unusual hardware, such as point-of-sale terminals or consumer appliances For more information, review the instrumentation for browser monitoring documentation, and verify end-user network access. Browser types Instrumentation is compatible with every browser type, including Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox, Microsoft Internet Explorer and Edge, and Apple Safari. The user interface is compatible with New Relic's supported browser versions. Exceptions Comments Paint timings The firstPaint and firstContentfulPaint attributes in BrowserInteraction, PageView, and PageViewTiming events are only compatible with: Chrome 60 or higher for desktop and mobile (Android webview and Chrome for Android) Opera 47 or higher for desktop Opera 44 or higher for Android mobile Samsung Internet for mobile AJAX AJAX timing features are not available with: Chrome for iPhone and iPad IE 7 and 8 PageAction events PageAction events require a browser that fully supports cross-domain XMLHttpRequests. Internet Explorer versions 9 and lower cannot record PageAction events. Learn more on querying your data. Session traces Session traces are reported only from browsers that support the Resource Timing Specification. SHA-256 New Relic can only monitor browsers that are compatible with SHA-256. APM agents You can deploy the browser agent for apps monitored by APM, or you can deploy the browser agent for your standalone apps. For more information, see the installation procedures. If you are deploying browser for an app using APM, make sure your agent supports browser monitoring: C SDK: Version 1.0.0 or higher Go: Version 2.5.0 or higher Java: Version 3.4.0 or higher .NET: Version 2.20.25.0 or higher Node.js: Version 1.4.0 or higher PHP: Version 4.4.5.35 or higher Python: Version 2.10.1.9 or higher Ruby: Version 3.7.0.177 or higher Supported frameworks The browser agent collects data on all front-end frameworks. However, the monitoring occurs on lower-level \"primitives\" that JavaScript frameworks use, so the level of detail collected by the instrumentation may vary depending on your specific framework. Exceptions Comments Zone.js If you're using AngularJS and you want to use our SPA monitoring features, note that Zone.js versions 0.6.18 to 0.6.24 are not compatible with browser. In all cases, the browser agent must be loaded before Zone.js to avoid errors. Cypress.io Browser is unable to properly instrument the open and send methods of requests when tests are run in Cypress. This will cause the following error to be thrown: Cannot set property 'status' of undefined Copy This will only affect customers running tests with the Browser agent present in their code. Production applications should not be affected. html2pdf.js This library is not compatible with our Pro+SPA agent due to the way this library wraps promises. If you're using this library, we recommend selecting the Pro agent type. Content Security Policy (CSP) considerations In order to obtain accurate browser performance metrics, browser requires the use of a small, inline JavaScript snippet. New Relic carefully reviews the inline JavaScript to prevent Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) and other potential vulnerabilities. Content Security Policy Level 2 adds restrictions to the types of JavaScript allowed, such as inline scripts. It also limits which domains can load scripts during page load. Important If your website does not allow any third-party hosted JavaScript to run, you must request a CSP exception via your organization’s standard procedures in order to install the browser monitoring agent. When requesting a CSP exception, follow your organization's standard procedures to contact your web or security team. The browser JavaScript agent requires the following CSP exceptions in order to run properly. Alternatively, you can add all of these exceptions to the fallback default-src directive (instead of script-src and connect-src). CSP exception Comments unsafe-inline Add to the script-src directive or to the fallback default-src directive. This is required because the agent is installed by including an inline script. https://js-agent.newrelic.com Add to the script-src directive or to the fallback default-src directive. This is where additional script files that the agent requires are hosted. https://bam.nr-data.net https://bam-cell.nr-data.net Important Add https://gov-bam.nr-data.net if you're using FedRAMP-compliant endpoints. Add to the script-src directive or to the fallback default-src directive. This is where the agent sends its collected data. One of the calls to this URL is a JSONP call, which means that the URL must be allowed as a script source. Add to the connect-src directive or to the fallback default-src directive. The connect-src directive affects the URLs that scripts can call (for example, using the XMLHttpRequest interface). If you have CSP restrictions specifically around this directive, then add this URL as an exception.",

      "body": "Your end-user experience depends on your entire technology stack. You need to quickly understand what's causing a customer complaint or issue. Did the problem come from your infrastructure, your application, or the browsers that ultimately render it? Is it the result of a problematic internet provider, a problem in your own data center with failing CPU or memory, or something else? More than Real User Monitoring (RUM) Many websites contain dynamic content that is loaded after the initial page has finished loading, and complex JavaScript code increases the need for error reporting. Browser monitoring in New Relic One provides a Real User Monitoring (RUM) solution that measures the speed and performance of your end users as they navigate to your site from different web browsers, devices, operating systems, and networks. With browser monitoring in New Relic One, you see actionable data about your end users' experience with your app. But browser monitoring in New Relic goes far beyond the initial page load to measure full page life cycle data. For example, our browser UI shows you: Actual performance data, such as by page view popularity and user satisfaction (Apdex) scores Perceived performance data that measures how quickly your async or dynamic visuals and interactive page contents display JavaScript error analytics, stack traces, and line-of-code visibility, to show you the end-user steps leading up to an error itself Session performance with a detailed timeline and heat map of the load and interaction events during a webpage's full life cycle AJAX requests indicating problems with timing, end points, and specific locations in the webpage Hash-based route changes in apps with single-page application (SPA) architectures These tools (and more!) help your teams optimize your end users' page load experience, eliminate bugs, and troubleshoot faster across your full stack. Examine user perceptions Real user data gives insights into actual page performance, but you also need to look into your users' perception of your site's performance. Pages can load content in many different ways, and users control when they interact with that content. This is why some user-centric performance metrics happen outside the standard window onload (page load time) in the browser monitoring agent. The PageViewTiming event provides a more real-time delivery mechanism that does not have a dependency on any other event. Additional metrics include: First paint, first contentful paint, and largest contentful paint First input delay First interaction This helps you understand how users experience your site, both from visual and responsiveness standpoints. Improve interactive app performance Our single-page app (SPA) monitoring automatically tracks route changes, initial page loads, and synchronous and asynchronous activity during browser interactions. You can also use our browser agent and SPA API to monitor virtually anything that executes inside the browser. If you are a developer, SPA monitoring can help you: Create faster, more responsive, highly interactive apps. Monitor the throughput and performance that real users are experiencing. Troubleshoot and resolve problems within the context of the page load. Query and visualize the data to assist with business decisions. Bring better apps to the marketplace more quickly. Correlate front-end and back-end problems With New Relic One, you can instrument any type of data you need, such as metrics, events, logs, and traces. This helps you find actionable data about your end users' experience across the stack. For example: Full-Stack Observability Comments Locations or domains Limit browser monitoring to focus on specific geographical locations or specific types of end-user activity. You can also monitor or block specific domains. Trends in interactions Use our comparative charting feature for a direct page load time comparison between real user (browser) interactions and trends appearing in Synthetic monitors. Distributed tracing Isolate latency from the web browser through back-end services with distributed tracing. The UI helps you see the connection across across a full transaction, from browser activity, to time spent in network, to back-end activity. Browser types Explore your end users' experience with your app segmented by any types of browsers they use, including: Top browsers by throughput Average page load time by platform type (mobile, desktop, and other) Selected browser type by version (for example, Chrome 31, 32, 33, etc.) This helps you quickly determine whether problems with page load timing may be related to a specific browser type or platform, or whether the problem is more widespread. Get started with browser monitoring Follow these basic steps, and you'll quickly be up and running in New Relic with browser monitoring! Review the compatibility details and basic requirements for browser monitoring. Install the browser agent. Go to [one.newrelic.com > Explorer > Browser applications. Use the Explorer to access all your entities, that is, anything we can identify that reports data, from applications and hosts to custom groupings of any elements. View summary data from your Browser summary page, then drill down into page load timing details and other UI data. Configure your alerts for key performance data, or use our Applied Intelligence solutions to reduce alert noise, correlate incidents, and automatically detect anomalies. Query and visualize your default data (or customize your own), then analyze what that data says about your business. Customize and share your own charts and dashboards.",

      "body": "Before you install New Relic's Python agent, make sure your system meets these requirements. Basic requirements The Python agent supports many of the most common Python web frameworks. Additional configuration may be required depending on your specific hosting mechanism, hosting service, web framework, or back-end services. If you don't have one already, create a New Relic account. It's free, forever. Resource Requirements Operating systems UNIX-like operating systems including Linux, Solaris, FreeBSD, and macOS. The Python agent does not support Windows environments. Python Python (CPython/PyPy) versions supported: 2.7, 3.5, 3.6, 3.7, 3.8, and 3.9. Recommendation: Use Python version 3.6 or higher with our agent. Python versions 2.6 and 3.3 are supported only by Python agent versions 3.4.0.95 or lower. Python version 3.4 is supported only by Python agent versions 4.20.0.120 or lower. Python versions 2.7 and 3.5 follow our end of life (EOL) support requirements. Supported web frameworks Supported web frameworks include: Aiohttp Bottle CherryPy Django Falcon FastAPI Flask gRPC Pylons Pyramid Sanic Starlette Tornado 6 Web2Py Unsupported frameworks Some WSGI servers, frameworks, and apps have special requirements. Although a specific Python WSGI web framework may not be supported, you can still use the agent. For unsupported frameworks, a breakout of time spent in key parts of the framework will not appear in web transaction performance breakdowns and transaction traces. In addition, the agent will not be able to meaningfully group any web transactions handled by specific handlers in your code that you use to make them more useful and targeted. In these situations you can use the Python agent API to name web transactions or add custom instrumentation. Hosting Web hosting mechanisms compliant with WSGI 1.0 (PEP 333). For example, you can install the Python agent in a Google App Engine flexible environment. Security requirements As a standard security measure for data collection, your app server must support SHA-2 (256-bit). SHA-1 is not supported. Other monitoring software If your application uses other monitoring software besides ours, we cannot guarantee that our agent will work correctly and we cannot offer technical support. For more information, see Errors while using other monitoring software. Python package instrumentation The agent also provides instrumentation for a range of other Python packages and modules. Instrumentation includes database queries, memcache requests, external service requests, instance-level details, and more. The results will appear automatically in APM's user interface within web transaction performance breakdowns and transaction traces for slow transactions. Python version support The agent in general will support all released and active Python branches. However, to keep up with upcoming changes, the agent will also follow this Python version support schedule. The version support policy does not replace the general New Relic agent and plugin end-of-life (EOL) policy. Support for new Python releases The following are proposed time ranges. The actual release date may vary. Python version Active long term support (LTS) start date Initial release date of Python agent with support 3.8 October 21, 2019 November-December 2019 End of support for Python releases reaching EOL The following are proposed time ranges. The actual release date may vary. Python version End of life (EOL) date Initial release date of Python agent dropping support 3.5 September 13, 2020 Deprecated as of Python agent version 5.22.0.151 Python agent versions released after December 22, 2020 do not support Python 3.5. For more information, see our Python agent release notes and our Explorers Hub post. 2.7 January 1, 2020 TBD Connect the agent to other Full-Stack Observability capabilities The Python agent integrates with other capabilities to give you end-to-end visibility: Product Integration Browser monitoring The Python agent automatically injects the browser JavaScript agent when you enable auto-instrumentation. After enabling browser injection, you can view browser data in the APM Summary page and quickly switch between the APM and browser data for a particular app. For configuration options and manual instrumentation, see Browser monitoring and the Python agent. Infrastructure monitoring When you install the Infrastructure monitoring and APM agents on the same host, they automatically detect one another. You can then view a list of hosts in the APM UI, and filter your Infrastructure hosts by APM app in the Infrastructure monitoring UI. For more information, see APM data in Infrastructure. Synthetic monitoring Synthetic transaction traces connect requests from synthetic monitors to the underlying APM transaction.",

Before you install the browser agent, make sure your system meets these requirements. Want to try out our browser monitoring? Create a New Relic account for free! No credit card required. Basic requirements To report data to browser, your application must at a minimum meet two basic requirements: The traffic to the application must be from clients able to load and execute browser JavaScript code and set cookies. Clients accessing the application must be able to send data to New Relic through HTTP requests. HTTPS is required for browser Pro features. Important Browsers that subscribe to a disconnect list or that use content filtering extensions such as AdBlock may not be able to send data to New Relic. For example, if you are using the Enhanced Tracking Prevention disconnect list for Mozilla Firefox 69.0 or higher, you will need to change the default configuration. Most typical browser applications meet these requirements. However, browser applications in restricted environments may have difficulty reporting data to New Relic; for example: Hybrid mobile applications Applications installed on unusual hardware, such as point-of-sale terminals or consumer appliances For more information, review the instrumentation for browser monitoring documentation, and verify end-user network access. Browser types Instrumentation is compatible with every browser type, including Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox, Microsoft Internet Explorer and Edge, and Apple Safari. The user interface is compatible with New Relic's supported browser versions. Exceptions Comments Paint timings The firstPaint and firstContentfulPaint attributes in BrowserInteraction, PageView, and PageViewTiming events are only compatible with: Chrome 60 or higher for desktop and mobile (Android webview and Chrome for Android) Opera 47 or higher for desktop Opera 44 or higher for Android mobile Samsung Internet for mobile AJAX AJAX timing features are not available with: Chrome for iPhone and iPad IE 7 and 8 PageAction events PageAction events require a browser that fully supports cross-domain XMLHttpRequests. Internet Explorer versions 9 and lower cannot record PageAction events. Learn more on querying your data. Session traces Session traces are reported only from browsers that support the Resource Timing Specification. SHA-256 New Relic can only monitor browsers that are compatible with SHA-256. APM agents You can deploy the browser agent for apps monitored by APM, or you can deploy the browser agent for your standalone apps. For more information, see the installation procedures. If you are deploying browser for an app using APM, make sure your agent supports browser monitoring: C SDK: Version 1.0.0 or higher Go: Version 2.5.0 or higher Java: Version 3.4.0 or higher .NET: Version 2.20.25.0 or higher Node.js: Version 1.4.0 or higher PHP: Version 4.4.5.35 or higher Python: Version 2.10.1.9 or higher Ruby: Version 3.7.0.177 or higher Supported frameworks The browser agent collects data on all front-end frameworks. However, the monitoring occurs on lower-level \"primitives\" that JavaScript frameworks use, so the level of detail collected by the instrumentation may vary depending on your specific framework. Exceptions Comments Zone.js If you're using AngularJS and you want to use our SPA monitoring features, note that Zone.js versions 0.6.18 to 0.6.24 are not compatible with browser. In all cases, the browser agent must be loaded before Zone.js to avoid errors. Cypress.io Browser is unable to properly instrument the open and send methods of requests when tests are run in Cypress. This will cause the following error to be thrown: Cannot set property 'status' of undefined Copy This will only affect customers running tests with the Browser agent present in their code. Production applications should not be affected. html2pdf.js This library is not compatible with our Pro+SPA agent due to the way this library wraps promises. If you're using this library, we recommend selecting the Pro agent type. Content Security Policy (CSP) considerations In order to obtain accurate browser performance metrics, browser requires the use of a small, inline JavaScript snippet. New Relic carefully reviews the inline JavaScript to prevent Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) and other potential vulnerabilities. Content Security Policy Level 2 adds restrictions to the types of JavaScript allowed, such as inline scripts. It also limits which domains can load scripts during page load. Important If your website does not allow any third-party hosted JavaScript to run, you must request a CSP exception via your organization’s standard procedures in order to install the browser monitoring agent. When requesting a CSP exception, follow your organization's standard procedures to contact your web or security team. The browser JavaScript agent requires the following CSP exceptions in order to run properly. Alternatively, you can add all of these exceptions to the fallback default-src directive (instead of script-src and connect-src). CSP exception Comments unsafe-inline Add to the script-src directive or to the fallback default-src directive. This is required because the agent is installed by including an inline script. https://js-agent.newrelic.com Add to the script-src directive or to the fallback default-src directive. This is where additional script files that the agent requires are hosted. https://bam.nr-data.net https://bam-cell.nr-data.net Important Add https://gov-bam.nr-data.net if you're using FedRAMP-compliant endpoints. Add to the script-src directive or to the fallback default-src directive. This is where the agent sends its collected data. One of the calls to this URL is a JSONP call, which means that the URL must be allowed as a script source. Add to the connect-src directive or to the fallback default-src directive. The connect-src directive affects the URLs that scripts can call (for example, using the XMLHttpRequest interface). If you have CSP restrictions specifically around this directive, then add this URL as an exception.",

      "body": "Before you install New Relic's Python agent, make sure your system meets these requirements. Basic requirements The Python agent supports many of the most common Python web frameworks. Additional configuration may be required depending on your specific hosting mechanism, hosting service, web framework, or back-end services. If you don't have one already, create a New Relic account. It's free, forever. Resource Requirements Operating systems UNIX-like operating systems including Linux, Solaris, FreeBSD, and macOS. The Python agent does not support Windows environments. Python Python (CPython/PyPy) versions supported: 2.7, 3.5, 3.6, 3.7, 3.8, and 3.9. Recommendation: Use Python version 3.6 or higher with our agent. Python versions 2.6 and 3.3 are supported only by Python agent versions 3.4.0.95 or lower. Python version 3.4 is supported only by Python agent versions 4.20.0.120 or lower. Python versions 2.7 and 3.5 follow our end of life (EOL) support requirements. Supported web frameworks Supported web frameworks include: Aiohttp Bottle CherryPy Django Falcon FastAPI Flask gRPC Pylons Pyramid Sanic Starlette Tornado 6 Web2Py Unsupported frameworks Some WSGI servers, frameworks, and apps have special requirements. Although a specific Python WSGI web framework may not be supported, you can still use the agent. For unsupported frameworks, a breakout of time spent in key parts of the framework will not appear in web transaction performance breakdowns and transaction traces. In addition, the agent will not be able to meaningfully group any web transactions handled by specific handlers in your code that you use to make them more useful and targeted. In these situations you can use the Python agent API to name web transactions or add custom instrumentation. Hosting Web hosting mechanisms compliant with WSGI 1.0 (PEP 333). For example, you can install the Python agent in a Google App Engine flexible environment. Security requirements As a standard security measure for data collection, your app server must support SHA-2 (256-bit). SHA-1 is not supported. Other monitoring software If your application uses other monitoring software besides ours, we cannot guarantee that our agent will work correctly and we cannot offer technical support. For more information, see Errors while using other monitoring software. Python package instrumentation The agent also provides instrumentation for a range of other Python packages and modules. Instrumentation includes database queries, memcache requests, external service requests, instance-level details, and more. The results will appear automatically in APM's user interface within web transaction performance breakdowns and transaction traces for slow transactions. Python version support The agent in general will support all released and active Python branches. However, to keep up with upcoming changes, the agent will also follow this Python version support schedule. The version support policy does not replace the general New Relic agent and plugin end-of-life (EOL) policy. Support for new Python releases The following are proposed time ranges. The actual release date may vary. Python version Active long term support (LTS) start date Initial release date of Python agent with support 3.8 October 21, 2019 November-December 2019 End of support for Python releases reaching EOL The following are proposed time ranges. The actual release date may vary. Python version End of life (EOL) date Initial release date of Python agent dropping support 3.5 September 13, 2020 Deprecated as of Python agent version 5.22.0.151 Python agent versions released after December 22, 2020 do not support Python 3.5. For more information, see our Python agent release notes and our Explorers Hub post. 2.7 January 1, 2020 TBD Connect the agent to other Full-Stack Observability capabilities The Python agent integrates with other capabilities to give you end-to-end visibility: Product Integration Browser monitoring The Python agent automatically injects the browser JavaScript agent when you enable auto-instrumentation. After enabling browser injection, you can view browser data in the APM Summary page and quickly switch between the APM and browser data for a particular app. For configuration options and manual instrumentation, see Browser monitoring and the Python agent. Infrastructure monitoring When you install the Infrastructure monitoring and APM agents on the same host, they automatically detect one another. You can then view a list of hosts in the APM UI, and filter your Infrastructure hosts by APM app in the Infrastructure monitoring UI. For more information, see APM data in Infrastructure. Synthetic monitoring Synthetic transaction traces connect requests from synthetic monitors to the underlying APM transaction.",

To update to the latest version, check your version number, then follow the steps for either updating an APM-managed installation or upgrading a copy/paste installation. Check your version number To verify your browser version number: View the source code of a page which includes the JavaScript snippet. Search the page source for js-agent.newrelic.com/nr-. The numbers that follow nr- are your current version. For example, js-agent.newrelic.com/nr-593.min.js indicates you are running version 593 of the browser script. There are different agent types.

Search for js-agent.newrelic.com/nr-, then note the numbers that follow nr-. If the latest version number is higher than the number of the version you are currently running, update your browser agent. Check deployment method Your browser agent may have been deployed in two ways: either using a manual implementation (copying and pasting the snippet) or automatically instrumented using an APM agent. To check which deployment method was used, run this command in the JavaScript console: > newrelic.info.sa Copy If the command returns 1, then your browser agent used the copy/paste method. Update your APM-managed installation To update your APM-managed browser installation, restart your APM agent. Your app will automatically update to the latest JavaScript snippet. To ensure the new script registers, you may need to clear your cache. For more information, follow the troubleshooting procedures to manually check and clear the cache. Update your copy/paste installation Use any of the following options to access the browser JavaScript snippet needed to update a copy/paste installation. After accessing the snippet, be sure to replace all of your existing snippet with the new version. If you have a standalone installation with a few applications, you can retrieve the snippet from the UI, and then replace it with the new version. If you have many applications, you can use the REST API or the loader endpoint to automate the update process. Caution Do not simply change the version number in the existing snippet. This can result in incomplete data collection. For best results after you use any of the following options, always update the agent. Retrieve the snippet from the UI Download the latest version of the snippet: Go to one.newrelic.com > Browser > (select an app) > Application settings. This option is only available for standalone installations. Extract the snippet with the REST API To update the snippet using the New Relic REST API, follow the process for viewing a specific browser app. The loader_script attribute in your response will include the latest JavaScript snippet. This may be a good solution if you have many applications to manage, or if your browser app is linked to an APM app. Update using the loader endpoint To update the snippet from the New Relic loader endpoint, you can choose which type of browser agent you want: Pro+SPA endpoint Pro endpoint Lite endpoint These endpoints always point to the latest version of the agent. We recommend using the Pro+SPA agent. Read more about these agent types. These loader endpoints are generic and do not include your specific configuration data. To add your configuration data to the loaders: Find your browser application ID and license key: Follow standard procedures to use the New Relic UI or the REST API. Set your browser application ID and license key immediately after the snippet. NREUM.info = { applicationID: \"YOUR-APPLICATION-ID\", licenseKey: \"YOUR-BROWSER-LICENSE-KEY\" }; Copy",

      "body": "Browser monitoring's PageViewTiming event sends each data point as a separate event as soon as it is available. Because we do not restrict the timing, you can receive first paint or first interaction data regardless of when it fires. This document describes why and how to use PageViewTiming and its attributes to query data about your site, component loading, and user performance metrics, both from visual and responsiveness standpoints. Why use PageViewTiming? If your application uses asynchronous or dynamic pages, you may need additional details about site or component loading. But pages can load content in many different ways, and users control when they interact with that content. This is why some user-centric performance metrics happen outside the standard window onload (page load time) in the browser agent. For example, users may become impatient and begin clicking as soon as content is on the webpage. Or, they may wait to use the page until long after content is loaded. The PageViewTiming event provides a more real-time delivery mechanism that does not have a dependency on any other event. The additional metrics can help you understand how users experience your site, both from visual and responsiveness standpoints. Support for Google's Core Web Vitals We now, with the release of agent version 1177, have full support for Google's Core Web Vitals for 2020. The metrics that make up Core Web Vitals will evolve over time. The current set for 2020 focuses on three aspects of the user experience—loading, interactivity, and visual stability—and includes the following metrics (and their respective thresholds): Core Web Vitals metrics include loading, interactivity, and visual stability. Largest Contentful Paint (LCP): measures loading performance. To provide a good user experience, LCP should occur within 2.5 seconds of when the page first starts loading. First Input Delay (FID): measures interactivity. To provide a good user experience, pages should have a FID of less than 100 milliseconds. Cumulative Layout Shift (CLS): measures visual stability. To provide a good user experience, pages should maintain a CLS of less than 0.1. For each of the above metrics, to ensure you're hitting the recommended target for most of your users, a good threshold to measure is the 75th percentile of page loads, segmented across mobile and desktop devices. To learn more, watch our Nerd Days talk on perceived performance. Detailed visual, interactivity, and responsiveness metrics The BrowserInteraction and PageView events end their reporting when they receive the page window load (or window load and AJAX) timing. However, paint and interactivity metrics can happen at any time. PageViewTiming delivers these metrics as a separate event to: Account for the variability in this timing. Avoid setting an arbitrary timeout. Prevent holding BrowserInteraction and PageView events indefinitely. Additional data Comments firstPaint and firstContentfulPaint The firstPaint and firstContentfulPaint attributes already are available with BrowserInteraction and PageView events. However, they are not always reliably captured before the window onload event fires. Using PageViewTiming gives you a way to capture these metrics even if they happen after the original page load time. This gives you a better understanding of the correlation between responsiveness of that load event and the visual rendering of your content. largestContentfulPaint This new metric, available with agent version 1163, largestContentfulPaint, reports the render time of the largest content element visible in the viewport. Google's research found looking at when the largest element was rendered was a more accurate way to measure when the main content of a page is loaded and useful. Details on this metric, including limitations and considerations can be found in the w3c draft. In addition, we now report the cumulative layout shift (CLS) score attribute with LCP. This attribute is reported as cumulativeLayoutShift. Largest Contentful Paint is one of three metrics identified by Google as the Core Web Vitals. LCP values up to 2.5 secs are considered \"Good\", between 2.5-4.0 secs considered \"Needs Improvement\", and above 4.0 secs considered \"Poor.\" firstInteraction and firstInputDelay With the addition of firstInteraction and firstInputDelay, you can quickly determine the ways that your users are interacting with that visual content. These metrics tell you not only when they interacted, but what type of interaction (mousedown, pointerdown, etc.) and how long it took for them to receive a response from your site. The firstInputDelay metric lies in the middle of FirstContentfulPaint and Time to Interactive (TTI) metrics, measuring the time between when a first input can be made and when the browser's main thread is able to respond to any interactions. In addition, we now report the cumulative layout shift (CLS) score attribute at the moment of the user's first interaction. This attribute is reported as cumulativeLayoutShift. First Input Delay is one of three metrics identified by Google as the Core Web Vitals. FID values up to 100 ms are considered \"Good\", between 100-300 ms considered \"Needs Improvement\", and above 300 ms considered \"Poor.\" For a more detailed explanation, see the Browser release notes. cumulativeLayoutShift Cumulative Layout Shift (CLS), available with agent v1177, is an important, user-centric metric for measuring visual stability because it helps quantify how often users experience unexpected layout shifts—a low CLS helps ensure that the page is delightful. This is one of three metrics identified by Google as the Core Web Vitals. Cumulative Layout Shift is one of three metrics identified by Google as the Core Web Vitals. CLS scores up to 0.1 are considered \"Good\", between 0.1-0.25 considered \"Needs Improvement\", and above 0.25 considered \"Poor.\" timingName You can review different types of activities with the timingName attribute, such as firstPaint, firstContentfulPaint, firstInteraction, largestContentfulPaint, pageHide and windowUnload. For example, a PageViewTiming event may have a timingName of firstPaint and a firstPaint value of .03. The event will also include all default attributes included with the standard BrowserInteraction and PageView events. elementId This is the Id, if specified, of the largestContentfulPaint element. This value will only be reported with the LCP metric. This value can be null. elementSize This is the reported size of the largestContentfulPaint element. This value will only be reported with the LCP metric. pageHide The pageHide event, available with agent v1177, is sent when the browser hides the current page in the process of presenting a different page from the session's history. For example, when the user clicks the browser's Back button, the current page receives a pageHide event before the previous page is shown. Supporting documentation and browser compatibility for the pageHide event can be found in MDN docs. In addition, we now report the cumulative layout shift (CLS) score attribute with pageHide. This attribute is reported as cumulativeLayoutShift. windowLoad The windowLoad event, available with agent v1177, is fired when the whole page has loaded, including all dependent resources such as stylesheets and images. Supporting documentation and browser compatibility for the Window Load event can be found in MDN docs. In addition, we now report the cumulative layout shift (CLS) score attribute with windowLoad. This attribute is reported as cumulativeLayoutShift. windowUnload The windowUnload event, available with agent v1163, is fired when a document or child resource is being unloaded. Supporting documentation and browser compatibility for the Window Unload event can be found in MDN docs. In addition, we now report the cumulative layout shift (CLS) score attribute with windowUnload. This attribute is reported as cumulativeLayoutShift. Compatibility and requirements Requirements: Meets install requirements Reporting of this event requires browser agent version 1153 or higher and a Pro or Pro+SPA agent. Follow our Browser agent release notes to find out when new metrics are released. These metrics are supported by the following browser versions. For unsupported browsers, no PageViewTiming events will be recorded. Metrics Supported browser versions cumulativeLayoutShift Chrome 79 Metric is elevated to stable; changes in metric definition will be reported in this log.

If a user navigates from a site without page load timing to a site with page load timing (for example, to the first page on your page load timing-enabled site), special considerations for navigation start time arise. Contents Network estimate The page load timing JavaScript utility file creates a cookie with the navigation start time when a user leaves a page (by hooking an event, beforeunload, or pagehide, depending on the browser). However, when navigating away from a site without page load timing enabled, the JavaScript code will not be present, and the cookie will not be created. Then, when the user hits the first page of a site, the navigation start time cannot be determined, because there is no cookie. In this case the browser agent has all the data (queue time, app time, DOM content and rendering time) except network time. Navigation start time is required to compute network time. Rather than toss the data, the page load timing feature estimates the network time based on recently accumulated averages for your application, regionally. This way the page load timing feature provides a more accurate throughput measurement, and the rest of the data is retained. This is especially important for sites with a high bounce rate (when users visit only one page). The more visitors you have from different regions, the more accurate the network estimate will be. Network estimate unavailable If a network estimate is not available for your application and for the region where the hit originated, the page load timing process reverts to a network estimate across all reporting apps for the region. Failing that, the data is tossed. Note: For browsers that have the Navigation Timing API, this is not an issue, as the navigation start time can be determined without using a cookie.

      "body": "This document explains: How a web page loads How browser monitoring measures page load timing, also known as real user monitoring (RUM) Tip This is a description of traditional, synchronous page load timing. Browser can also monitor asynchronous page load timing. Page load process Here are the major steps in the loading of most web pages. The numbers 1-6 in the diagram correspond to the numbered steps below. Page load timeline: The steps involved in a web page load. Browser monitoring charts display the following segments of that process: Network, Web application, DOM processing, and Page rendering. A page load begins when a user selects a hyperlink, submits a form, or types a URL in a browser. This is also referred to as the initial request or the navigation start. The user's action sends a request across the network to the web application server. The request reaches the application for processing. (The request may take some time to start being processed. This could be the result of request queuing or it could be other factors.) The app finishes processing and sends an HTML response back across the network to the user's browser. This is sometimes referred to as response start or first byte. The user's browser receives the HTML response and starts to process the Document Object Model, or DOM. The DOM finishes loading; this point is known as DOM ready. Using the DOM, the user's browser starts to render the page. The page finishes rendering in the user's browser and the window load event fires. (For pages that use asynchronous loading, some elements may continue to load after the window load event occurs.) Page load time charts in browser monitoring Browser monitoring captures the major page load timing segments in the browser Summary page and the Page views page. If you have SPA monitoring enabled, you will have access to both this chart and SPA-specific charts. The charts show: Network Web application time DOM processing Page rendering Other segments as applicable, such as request queuing The chart colors match the colors in the page load timing diagram. one.newrelic.com > Browser > (select an app) > Summary: The load time chart appears on the Summary and Page views page. The way browser collects these times depends on the browser's capability to use the Navigation Timing Specification API. You can add custom page load timing events with the browser agent API. Here are descriptions of the activity included in the browser load time chart segments: Web application The web application time includes the time spent on the application server. This can only be determined if the browser instrumentation for page load timing was provided by an APM agent. Network The Network layer includes time spent in redirects as well as in requesting and receiving HTML. It does not include time on the server or for static assets. Network time measurement starts from the initial click on a link. Network time includes DNS and may include more than one lookup if you have redirects on your site, TCP (including the firewall, unless you have configured request queue time monitoring), and SSL connect time. If you have configured request queue time monitoring, then the network time does not include any of the request queue time that occurs after the X-Request header. If you have not configured request queue time monitoring, then the network time does include all of the request queue time. The Navigation Timing Specification API provides a detailed breakdown of network time. (For old browsers, the timer starts on the \"before unload event.\") For apps that have been deployed using the copy/paste method, Browser includes web app and queue time in Network time. This is because browser relies on the server-side agent to pass the application values to the browser agent through auto-injection. For more information about how this back-end time breaks down from the browser's point of view, use the Session traces page. The session traces report on all the network related events available, so you can see on a case-by-case basis how the browser is spending time on DNS lookups and other network events. Important Even with request queuing configured, the front-end server's setup can still affect network time. This is because the front-end server does not add the queueing time header until after it actually accepts and processes the request. If the front-end server is configured in some way that causes requests to start backlogging and to queue up in the listener socket that the front-end server uses to accept connections, then you will see network time increase for browser monitoring. The queueing time headers can never account for backlog in this listener socket. DOM processing DOM processing is the time it takes to parse the HTML into a DOM and retrieve or execute synchronous scripts. If the browser starts to download images in this phase, page load timing will capture the image load time. The DOM processing and page rendering layers include network time for static assets (assets that are not explicitly retrieved after page load). However, if a script on the page dynamically inserts image tags and loads images after the server or content delivery system (CDN) finishes, page load timing cannot capture the image load time. Page rendering The Page rendering phase is the time between the DOM being complete and the window load event. This phase measures browser-side processing of the page content, and often includes time for scripts and static assets to load. Request queuing Request queuing will be displayed in the load time chart if your account has both browser and APM linked. In New Relic, request queuing refers to the time between a request entering your production systems and it reaching your application. Depending on the specifics of your production infrastructure, this time may include an actual queue that requests enter, or it may represent other functions that take time (such as load balancing or internal network latency). App server requests vs. browser transactions Often the number of app server transactions (requests per minute or rpm) is larger than the number of browser transactions (pages per minute or ppm) for the same application. For more information, see the troubleshooting procedures. Outliers No matter how well your application performs, there will be some slow browsers, platforms, and networks that make your overall aggregate response times appear slower. To minimize the skew caused by outliers, page load timing clamps and scales the end user response times that are greater than 4.5 times your application's browser Apdex T setting to 4.5 times the Apdex T, or to 13.5 seconds, whichever is greater. (Histogram outliers are cut off at 95%.) For example, if your application's end user Apdex T threshold is 8 seconds, those response times will be clamped at 36 seconds. This minimizes the impact of these response times on your overall application but still provides accounting for \"frustrated\" Apdex scores. For SPA monitoring, outliers are handled differently. When the duration of an initial page load or route change reaches 30 minutes, that event is treated as invalid data and is discarded.",

      "body": "Browser monitoring's PageViewTiming event sends each data point as a separate event as soon as it is available. Because we do not restrict the timing, you can receive first paint or first interaction data regardless of when it fires. This document describes why and how to use PageViewTiming and its attributes to query data about your site, component loading, and user performance metrics, both from visual and responsiveness standpoints. Why use PageViewTiming? If your application uses asynchronous or dynamic pages, you may need additional details about site or component loading. But pages can load content in many different ways, and users control when they interact with that content. This is why some user-centric performance metrics happen outside the standard window onload (page load time) in the browser agent. For example, users may become impatient and begin clicking as soon as content is on the webpage. Or, they may wait to use the page until long after content is loaded. The PageViewTiming event provides a more real-time delivery mechanism that does not have a dependency on any other event. The additional metrics can help you understand how users experience your site, both from visual and responsiveness standpoints. Support for Google's Core Web Vitals We now, with the release of agent version 1177, have full support for Google's Core Web Vitals for 2020. The metrics that make up Core Web Vitals will evolve over time. The current set for 2020 focuses on three aspects of the user experience—loading, interactivity, and visual stability—and includes the following metrics (and their respective thresholds): Core Web Vitals metrics include loading, interactivity, and visual stability. Largest Contentful Paint (LCP): measures loading performance. To provide a good user experience, LCP should occur within 2.5 seconds of when the page first starts loading. First Input Delay (FID): measures interactivity. To provide a good user experience, pages should have a FID of less than 100 milliseconds. Cumulative Layout Shift (CLS): measures visual stability. To provide a good user experience, pages should maintain a CLS of less than 0.1. For each of the above metrics, to ensure you're hitting the recommended target for most of your users, a good threshold to measure is the 75th percentile of page loads, segmented across mobile and desktop devices. To learn more, watch our Nerd Days talk on perceived performance. Detailed visual, interactivity, and responsiveness metrics The BrowserInteraction and PageView events end their reporting when they receive the page window load (or window load and AJAX) timing. However, paint and interactivity metrics can happen at any time. PageViewTiming delivers these metrics as a separate event to: Account for the variability in this timing. Avoid setting an arbitrary timeout. Prevent holding BrowserInteraction and PageView events indefinitely. Additional data Comments firstPaint and firstContentfulPaint The firstPaint and firstContentfulPaint attributes already are available with BrowserInteraction and PageView events. However, they are not always reliably captured before the window onload event fires. Using PageViewTiming gives you a way to capture these metrics even if they happen after the original page load time. This gives you a better understanding of the correlation between responsiveness of that load event and the visual rendering of your content. largestContentfulPaint This new metric, available with agent version 1163, largestContentfulPaint, reports the render time of the largest content element visible in the viewport. Google's research found looking at when the largest element was rendered was a more accurate way to measure when the main content of a page is loaded and useful. Details on this metric, including limitations and considerations can be found in the w3c draft. In addition, we now report the cumulative layout shift (CLS) score attribute with LCP. This attribute is reported as cumulativeLayoutShift. Largest Contentful Paint is one of three metrics identified by Google as the Core Web Vitals. LCP values up to 2.5 secs are considered \"Good\", between 2.5-4.0 secs considered \"Needs Improvement\", and above 4.0 secs considered \"Poor.\" firstInteraction and firstInputDelay With the addition of firstInteraction and firstInputDelay, you can quickly determine the ways that your users are interacting with that visual content. These metrics tell you not only when they interacted, but what type of interaction (mousedown, pointerdown, etc.) and how long it took for them to receive a response from your site. The firstInputDelay metric lies in the middle of FirstContentfulPaint and Time to Interactive (TTI) metrics, measuring the time between when a first input can be made and when the browser's main thread is able to respond to any interactions. In addition, we now report the cumulative layout shift (CLS) score attribute at the moment of the user's first interaction. This attribute is reported as cumulativeLayoutShift. First Input Delay is one of three metrics identified by Google as the Core Web Vitals. FID values up to 100 ms are considered \"Good\", between 100-300 ms considered \"Needs Improvement\", and above 300 ms considered \"Poor.\" For a more detailed explanation, see the Browser release notes. cumulativeLayoutShift Cumulative Layout Shift (CLS), available with agent v1177, is an important, user-centric metric for measuring visual stability because it helps quantify how often users experience unexpected layout shifts—a low CLS helps ensure that the page is delightful. This is one of three metrics identified by Google as the Core Web Vitals. Cumulative Layout Shift is one of three metrics identified by Google as the Core Web Vitals. CLS scores up to 0.1 are considered \"Good\", between 0.1-0.25 considered \"Needs Improvement\", and above 0.25 considered \"Poor.\" timingName You can review different types of activities with the timingName attribute, such as firstPaint, firstContentfulPaint, firstInteraction, largestContentfulPaint, pageHide and windowUnload. For example, a PageViewTiming event may have a timingName of firstPaint and a firstPaint value of .03. The event will also include all default attributes included with the standard BrowserInteraction and PageView events. elementId This is the Id, if specified, of the largestContentfulPaint element. This value will only be reported with the LCP metric. This value can be null. elementSize This is the reported size of the largestContentfulPaint element. This value will only be reported with the LCP metric. pageHide The pageHide event, available with agent v1177, is sent when the browser hides the current page in the process of presenting a different page from the session's history. For example, when the user clicks the browser's Back button, the current page receives a pageHide event before the previous page is shown. Supporting documentation and browser compatibility for the pageHide event can be found in MDN docs. In addition, we now report the cumulative layout shift (CLS) score attribute with pageHide. This attribute is reported as cumulativeLayoutShift. windowLoad The windowLoad event, available with agent v1177, is fired when the whole page has loaded, including all dependent resources such as stylesheets and images. Supporting documentation and browser compatibility for the Window Load event can be found in MDN docs. In addition, we now report the cumulative layout shift (CLS) score attribute with windowLoad. This attribute is reported as cumulativeLayoutShift. windowUnload The windowUnload event, available with agent v1163, is fired when a document or child resource is being unloaded. Supporting documentation and browser compatibility for the Window Unload event can be found in MDN docs. In addition, we now report the cumulative layout shift (CLS) score attribute with windowUnload. This attribute is reported as cumulativeLayoutShift. Compatibility and requirements Requirements: Meets install requirements Reporting of this event requires browser agent version 1153 or higher and a Pro or Pro+SPA agent. Follow our Browser agent release notes to find out when new metrics are released. These metrics are supported by the following browser versions. For unsupported browsers, no PageViewTiming events will be recorded. Metrics Supported browser versions cumulativeLayoutShift Chrome 79 Metric is elevated to stable; changes in metric definition will be reported in this log. Chrome 77 Metric exposed via API: Cumulative Layout Shift available via Layout Instability API firstPaint firstContentfulPaint Chrome 60 or higher for desktop and mobile (Android webview and Chrome for Android) Opera 47 or higher for desktop Opera 44 or higher for Android mobile Samsung Internet for mobile largestContentfulPaint Chrome 77 or higher for desktop and mobile firstInteraction firstInputDelay These metrics require the addEventListener browser API. This API is available in all modern browsers, including: Apple Safari Google Chrome Microsoft Internet Explorer (IE) versions 9 or higher Mozilla Firefox pageHide This metric is currently supported by all browsers on desktop and mobile.

If a user navigates from a site without page load timing to a site with page load timing (for example, to the first page on your page load timing-enabled site), special considerations for navigation start time arise. Contents Network estimate The page load timing JavaScript utility file creates a cookie with the navigation start time when a user leaves a page (by hooking an event, beforeunload, or pagehide, depending on the browser). However, when navigating away from a site without page load timing enabled, the JavaScript code will not be present, and the cookie will not be created. Then, when the user hits the first page of a site, the navigation start time cannot be determined, because there is no cookie. In this case the browser agent has all the data (queue time, app time, DOM content and rendering time) except network time. Navigation start time is required to compute network time. Rather than toss the data, the page load timing feature estimates the network time based on recently accumulated averages for your application, regionally. This way the page load timing feature provides a more accurate throughput measurement, and the rest of the data is retained. This is especially important for sites with a high bounce rate (when users visit only one page). The more visitors you have from different regions, the more accurate the network estimate will be. Network estimate unavailable If a network estimate is not available for your application and for the region where the hit originated, the page load timing process reverts to a network estimate across all reporting apps for the region. Failing that, the data is tossed. Note: For browsers that have the Navigation Timing API, this is not an issue, as the navigation start time can be determined without using a cookie.

      "body": "This document explains: How a web page loads How browser monitoring measures page load timing, also known as real user monitoring (RUM) Tip This is a description of traditional, synchronous page load timing. Browser can also monitor asynchronous page load timing. Page load process Here are the major steps in the loading of most web pages. The numbers 1-6 in the diagram correspond to the numbered steps below. Page load timeline: The steps involved in a web page load. Browser monitoring charts display the following segments of that process: Network, Web application, DOM processing, and Page rendering. A page load begins when a user selects a hyperlink, submits a form, or types a URL in a browser. This is also referred to as the initial request or the navigation start. The user's action sends a request across the network to the web application server. The request reaches the application for processing. (The request may take some time to start being processed. This could be the result of request queuing or it could be other factors.) The app finishes processing and sends an HTML response back across the network to the user's browser. This is sometimes referred to as response start or first byte. The user's browser receives the HTML response and starts to process the Document Object Model, or DOM. The DOM finishes loading; this point is known as DOM ready. Using the DOM, the user's browser starts to render the page. The page finishes rendering in the user's browser and the window load event fires. (For pages that use asynchronous loading, some elements may continue to load after the window load event occurs.) Page load time charts in browser monitoring Browser monitoring captures the major page load timing segments in the browser Summary page and the Page views page. If you have SPA monitoring enabled, you will have access to both this chart and SPA-specific charts. The charts show: Network Web application time DOM processing Page rendering Other segments as applicable, such as request queuing The chart colors match the colors in the page load timing diagram. one.newrelic.com > Browser > (select an app) > Summary: The load time chart appears on the Summary and Page views page. The way browser collects these times depends on the browser's capability to use the Navigation Timing Specification API. You can add custom page load timing events with the browser agent API. Here are descriptions of the activity included in the browser load time chart segments: Web application The web application time includes the time spent on the application server. This can only be determined if the browser instrumentation for page load timing was provided by an APM agent. Network The Network layer includes time spent in redirects as well as in requesting and receiving HTML. It does not include time on the server or for static assets. Network time measurement starts from the initial click on a link. Network time includes DNS and may include more than one lookup if you have redirects on your site, TCP (including the firewall, unless you have configured request queue time monitoring), and SSL connect time. If you have configured request queue time monitoring, then the network time does not include any of the request queue time that occurs after the X-Request header. If you have not configured request queue time monitoring, then the network time does include all of the request queue time. The Navigation Timing Specification API provides a detailed breakdown of network time. (For old browsers, the timer starts on the \"before unload event.\") For apps that have been deployed using the copy/paste method, Browser includes web app and queue time in Network time. This is because browser relies on the server-side agent to pass the application values to the browser agent through auto-injection. For more information about how this back-end time breaks down from the browser's point of view, use the Session traces page. The session traces report on all the network related events available, so you can see on a case-by-case basis how the browser is spending time on DNS lookups and other network events. Important Even with request queuing configured, the front-end server's setup can still affect network time. This is because the front-end server does not add the queueing time header until after it actually accepts and processes the request. If the front-end server is configured in some way that causes requests to start backlogging and to queue up in the listener socket that the front-end server uses to accept connections, then you will see network time increase for browser monitoring. The queueing time headers can never account for backlog in this listener socket. DOM processing DOM processing is the time it takes to parse the HTML into a DOM and retrieve or execute synchronous scripts. If the browser starts to download images in this phase, page load timing will capture the image load time. The DOM processing and page rendering layers include network time for static assets (assets that are not explicitly retrieved after page load). However, if a script on the page dynamically inserts image tags and loads images after the server or content delivery system (CDN) finishes, page load timing cannot capture the image load time. Page rendering The Page rendering phase is the time between the DOM being complete and the window load event. This phase measures browser-side processing of the page content, and often includes time for scripts and static assets to load. Request queuing Request queuing will be displayed in the load time chart if your account has both browser and APM linked. In New Relic, request queuing refers to the time between a request entering your production systems and it reaching your application. Depending on the specifics of your production infrastructure, this time may include an actual queue that requests enter, or it may represent other functions that take time (such as load balancing or internal network latency). App server requests vs. browser transactions Often the number of app server transactions (requests per minute or rpm) is larger than the number of browser transactions (pages per minute or ppm) for the same application. For more information, see the troubleshooting procedures. Outliers No matter how well your application performs, there will be some slow browsers, platforms, and networks that make your overall aggregate response times appear slower. To minimize the skew caused by outliers, page load timing clamps and scales the end user response times that are greater than 4.5 times your application's browser Apdex T setting to 4.5 times the Apdex T, or to 13.5 seconds, whichever is greater. (Histogram outliers are cut off at 95%.) For example, if your application's end user Apdex T threshold is 8 seconds, those response times will be clamped at 36 seconds. This minimizes the impact of these response times on your overall application but still provides accounting for \"frustrated\" Apdex scores. For SPA monitoring, outliers are handled differently. When the duration of an initial page load or route change reaches 30 minutes, that event is treated as invalid data and is discarded.",

Before you install the browser agent, make sure your system meets these requirements. Want to try out our browser monitoring? Create a New Relic account for free! No credit card required. Basic requirements To report data to browser, your application must at a minimum meet two basic requirements: The traffic to the application must be from clients able to load and execute browser JavaScript code and set cookies. Clients accessing the application must be able to send data to New Relic through HTTP requests. HTTPS is required for browser Pro features. Important Browsers that subscribe to a disconnect list or that use content filtering extensions such as AdBlock may not be able to send data to New Relic. For example, if you are using the Enhanced Tracking Prevention disconnect list for Mozilla Firefox 69.0 or higher, you will need to change the default configuration. Most typical browser applications meet these requirements. However, browser applications in restricted environments may have difficulty reporting data to New Relic; for example: Hybrid mobile applications Applications installed on unusual hardware, such as point-of-sale terminals or consumer appliances For more information, review the instrumentation for browser monitoring documentation, and verify end-user network access. Browser types Instrumentation is compatible with every browser type, including Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox, Microsoft Internet Explorer and Edge, and Apple Safari. The user interface is compatible with New Relic's supported browser versions. Exceptions Comments Paint timings The firstPaint and firstContentfulPaint attributes in BrowserInteraction, PageView, and PageViewTiming events are only compatible with: Chrome 60 or higher for desktop and mobile (Android webview and Chrome for Android) Opera 47 or higher for desktop Opera 44 or higher for Android mobile Samsung Internet for mobile AJAX AJAX timing features are not available with: Chrome for iPhone and iPad IE 7 and 8 PageAction events PageAction events require a browser that fully supports cross-domain XMLHttpRequests. Internet Explorer versions 9 and lower cannot record PageAction events. Learn more on querying your data. Session traces Session traces are reported only from browsers that support the Resource Timing Specification. SHA-256 New Relic can only monitor browsers that are compatible with SHA-256. APM agents You can deploy the browser agent for apps monitored by APM, or you can deploy the browser agent for your standalone apps. For more information, see the installation procedures. If you are deploying browser for an app using APM, make sure your agent supports browser monitoring: C SDK: Version 1.0.0 or higher Go: Version 2.5.0 or higher Java: Version 3.4.0 or higher .NET: Version 2.20.25.0 or higher Node.js: Version 1.4.0 or higher PHP: Version 4.4.5.35 or higher Python: Version 2.10.1.9 or higher Ruby: Version 3.7.0.177 or higher Supported frameworks The browser agent collects data on all front-end frameworks. However, the monitoring occurs on lower-level \"primitives\" that JavaScript frameworks use, so the level of detail collected by the instrumentation may vary depending on your specific framework. Exceptions Comments Zone.js If you're using AngularJS and you want to use our SPA monitoring features, note that Zone.js versions 0.6.18 to 0.6.24 are not compatible with browser. In all cases, the browser agent must be loaded before Zone.js to avoid errors. Cypress.io Browser is unable to properly instrument the open and send methods of requests when tests are run in Cypress. This will cause the following error to be thrown: Cannot set property 'status' of undefined Copy This will only affect customers running tests with the Browser agent present in their code. Production applications should not be affected. html2pdf.js This library is not compatible with our Pro+SPA agent due to the way this library wraps promises. If you're using this library, we recommend selecting the Pro agent type. Content Security Policy (CSP) considerations In order to obtain accurate browser performance metrics, browser requires the use of a small, inline JavaScript snippet. New Relic carefully reviews the inline JavaScript to prevent Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) and other potential vulnerabilities. Content Security Policy Level 2 adds restrictions to the types of JavaScript allowed, such as inline scripts. It also limits which domains can load scripts during page load. Important If your website does not allow any third-party hosted JavaScript to run, you must request a CSP exception via your organization’s standard procedures in order to install the browser monitoring agent. When requesting a CSP exception, follow your organization's standard procedures to contact your web or security team. The browser JavaScript agent requires the following CSP exceptions in order to run properly. Alternatively, you can add all of these exceptions to the fallback default-src directive (instead of script-src and connect-src). CSP exception Comments unsafe-inline Add to the script-src directive or to the fallback default-src directive. This is required because the agent is installed by including an inline script. https://js-agent.newrelic.com Add to the script-src directive or to the fallback default-src directive. This is where additional script files that the agent requires are hosted. https://bam.nr-data.net https://bam-cell.nr-data.net Important Add https://gov-bam.nr-data.net if you're using FedRAMP-compliant endpoints. Add to the script-src directive or to the fallback default-src directive. This is where the agent sends its collected data. One of the calls to this URL is a JSONP call, which means that the URL must be allowed as a script source. Add to the connect-src directive or to the fallback default-src directive. The connect-src directive affects the URLs that scripts can call (for example, using the XMLHttpRequest interface). If you have CSP restrictions specifically around this directive, then add this URL as an exception.",

      "body": "Your end-user experience depends on your entire technology stack. You need to quickly understand what's causing a customer complaint or issue. Did the problem come from your infrastructure, your application, or the browsers that ultimately render it? Is it the result of a problematic internet provider, a problem in your own data center with failing CPU or memory, or something else? More than Real User Monitoring (RUM) Many websites contain dynamic content that is loaded after the initial page has finished loading, and complex JavaScript code increases the need for error reporting. Browser monitoring in New Relic One provides a Real User Monitoring (RUM) solution that measures the speed and performance of your end users as they navigate to your site from different web browsers, devices, operating systems, and networks. With browser monitoring in New Relic One, you see actionable data about your end users' experience with your app. But browser monitoring in New Relic goes far beyond the initial page load to measure full page life cycle data. For example, our browser UI shows you: Actual performance data, such as by page view popularity and user satisfaction (Apdex) scores Perceived performance data that measures how quickly your async or dynamic visuals and interactive page contents display JavaScript error analytics, stack traces, and line-of-code visibility, to show you the end-user steps leading up to an error itself Session performance with a detailed timeline and heat map of the load and interaction events during a webpage's full life cycle AJAX requests indicating problems with timing, end points, and specific locations in the webpage Hash-based route changes in apps with single-page application (SPA) architectures These tools (and more!) help your teams optimize your end users' page load experience, eliminate bugs, and troubleshoot faster across your full stack. Examine user perceptions Real user data gives insights into actual page performance, but you also need to look into your users' perception of your site's performance. Pages can load content in many different ways, and users control when they interact with that content. This is why some user-centric performance metrics happen outside the standard window onload (page load time) in the browser monitoring agent. The PageViewTiming event provides a more real-time delivery mechanism that does not have a dependency on any other event. Additional metrics include: First paint, first contentful paint, and largest contentful paint First input delay First interaction This helps you understand how users experience your site, both from visual and responsiveness standpoints. Improve interactive app performance Our single-page app (SPA) monitoring automatically tracks route changes, initial page loads, and synchronous and asynchronous activity during browser interactions. You can also use our browser agent and SPA API to monitor virtually anything that executes inside the browser. If you are a developer, SPA monitoring can help you: Create faster, more responsive, highly interactive apps. Monitor the throughput and performance that real users are experiencing. Troubleshoot and resolve problems within the context of the page load. Query and visualize the data to assist with business decisions. Bring better apps to the marketplace more quickly. Correlate front-end and back-end problems With New Relic One, you can instrument any type of data you need, such as metrics, events, logs, and traces. This helps you find actionable data about your end users' experience across the stack. For example: Full-Stack Observability Comments Locations or domains Limit browser monitoring to focus on specific geographical locations or specific types of end-user activity. You can also monitor or block specific domains. Trends in interactions Use our comparative charting feature for a direct page load time comparison between real user (browser) interactions and trends appearing in Synthetic monitors. Distributed tracing Isolate latency from the web browser through back-end services with distributed tracing. The UI helps you see the connection across across a full transaction, from browser activity, to time spent in network, to back-end activity. Browser types Explore your end users' experience with your app segmented by any types of browsers they use, including: Top browsers by throughput Average page load time by platform type (mobile, desktop, and other) Selected browser type by version (for example, Chrome 31, 32, 33, etc.) This helps you quickly determine whether problems with page load timing may be related to a specific browser type or platform, or whether the problem is more widespread. Get started with browser monitoring Follow these basic steps, and you'll quickly be up and running in New Relic with browser monitoring! Review the compatibility details and basic requirements for browser monitoring. Install the browser agent. Go to [one.newrelic.com > Explorer > Browser applications. Use the Explorer to access all your entities, that is, anything we can identify that reports data, from applications and hosts to custom groupings of any elements. View summary data from your Browser summary page, then drill down into page load timing details and other UI data. Configure your alerts for key performance data, or use our Applied Intelligence solutions to reduce alert noise, correlate incidents, and automatically detect anomalies. Query and visualize your default data (or customize your own), then analyze what that data says about your business. Customize and share your own charts and dashboards.",

      "body": "Browser monitoring includes strict security measures to provide a robust, standalone product with browser monitoring features. Before you install the browser agent, make sure your system meets these requirements. Want to try out our browser monitoring? Create a New Relic account for free! No credit card required. Basic requirements To report data to browser, your application must at a minimum meet two basic requirements: The traffic to the application must be from clients able to load and execute browser JavaScript code and set cookies. Clients accessing the application must be able to send data to New Relic through HTTP requests. HTTPS is required for browser Pro features. Important Browsers that subscribe to a disconnect list or that use content filtering extensions such as AdBlock may not be able to send data to New Relic. For example, if you are using the Enhanced Tracking Prevention disconnect list for Mozilla Firefox 69.0 or higher, you will need to change the default configuration. Most typical browser applications meet these requirements. However, browser applications in restricted environments may have difficulty reporting data to New Relic; for example: Hybrid mobile applications Applications installed on unusual hardware, such as point-of-sale terminals or consumer appliances For more information, review the instrumentation for browser monitoring documentation, and verify end-user network access. Browser types Instrumentation is compatible with every browser type, including Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox, Microsoft Internet Explorer and Edge, and Apple Safari. The user interface is compatible with New Relic's supported browser versions. Exceptions Comments Paint timings The firstPaint and firstContentfulPaint attributes in BrowserInteraction, PageView, and PageViewTiming events are only compatible with: Chrome 60 or higher for desktop and mobile (Android webview and Chrome for Android) Opera 47 or higher for desktop Opera 44 or higher for Android mobile Samsung Internet for mobile AJAX AJAX timing features are not available with: Chrome for iPhone and iPad IE 7 and 8 PageAction events PageAction events require a browser that fully supports cross-domain XMLHttpRequests. Internet Explorer versions 9 and lower cannot record PageAction events. Learn more on querying your data. Session traces Session traces are reported only from browsers that support the Resource Timing Specification. SHA-256 New Relic can only monitor browsers that are compatible with SHA-256. APM agents You can deploy the browser agent for apps monitored by APM, or you can deploy the browser agent for your standalone apps. For more information, see the installation procedures. If you are deploying browser for an app using APM, make sure your agent supports browser monitoring: C SDK: Version 1.0.0 or higher Go: Version 2.5.0 or higher Java: Version 3.4.0 or higher .NET: Version 2.20.25.0 or higher Node.js: Version 1.4.0 or higher PHP: Version 4.4.5.35 or higher Python: Version 2.10.1.9 or higher Ruby: Version 3.7.0.177 or higher Supported frameworks The browser agent collects data on all front-end frameworks. However, the monitoring occurs on lower-level \"primitives\" that JavaScript frameworks use, so the level of detail collected by the instrumentation may vary depending on your specific framework. Exceptions Comments Zone.js If you're using AngularJS and you want to use our SPA monitoring features, note that Zone.js versions 0.6.18 to 0.6.24 are not compatible with browser. In all cases, the browser agent must be loaded before Zone.js to avoid errors. Cypress.io Browser is unable to properly instrument the open and send methods of requests when tests are run in Cypress. This will cause the following error to be thrown: Cannot set property 'status' of undefined Copy This will only affect customers running tests with the Browser agent present in their code. Production applications should not be affected. html2pdf.js This library is not compatible with our Pro+SPA agent due to the way this library wraps promises. If you're using this library, we recommend selecting the Pro agent type. Content Security Policy (CSP) considerations In order to obtain accurate browser performance metrics, browser requires the use of a small, inline JavaScript snippet. New Relic carefully reviews the inline JavaScript to prevent Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) and other potential vulnerabilities. Content Security Policy Level 2 adds restrictions to the types of JavaScript allowed, such as inline scripts. It also limits which domains can load scripts during page load. Important If your website does not allow any third-party hosted JavaScript to run, you must request a CSP exception via your organization’s standard procedures in order to install the browser monitoring agent. When requesting a CSP exception, follow your organization's standard procedures to contact your web or security team. The browser JavaScript agent requires the following CSP exceptions in order to run properly. Alternatively, you can add all of these exceptions to the fallback default-src directive (instead of script-src and connect-src). CSP exception Comments unsafe-inline Add to the script-src directive or to the fallback default-src directive. This is required because the agent is installed by including an inline script. https://js-agent.newrelic.com Add to the script-src directive or to the fallback default-src directive. This is where additional script files that the agent requires are hosted. https://bam.nr-data.net https://bam-cell.nr-data.net Important Add https://gov-bam.nr-data.net if you're using FedRAMP-compliant endpoints. Add to the script-src directive or to the fallback default-src directive. This is where the agent sends its collected data. One of the calls to this URL is a JSONP call, which means that the URL must be allowed as a script source. Add to the connect-src directive or to the fallback default-src directive. The connect-src directive affects the URLs that scripts can call (for example, using the XMLHttpRequest interface). If you have CSP restrictions specifically around this directive, then add this URL as an exception.",

Before you install the browser agent, make sure your system meets these requirements. Want to try out our browser monitoring? Create a New Relic account for free! No credit card required. Basic requirements To report data to browser, your application must at a minimum meet two basic requirements: The traffic to the application must be from clients able to load and execute browser JavaScript code and set cookies. Clients accessing the application must be able to send data to New Relic through HTTP requests. HTTPS is required for browser Pro features. Important Browsers that subscribe to a disconnect list or that use content filtering extensions such as AdBlock may not be able to send data to New Relic. For example, if you are using the Enhanced Tracking Prevention disconnect list for Mozilla Firefox 69.0 or higher, you will need to change the default configuration. Most typical browser applications meet these requirements. However, browser applications in restricted environments may have difficulty reporting data to New Relic; for example: Hybrid mobile applications Applications installed on unusual hardware, such as point-of-sale terminals or consumer appliances For more information, review the instrumentation for browser monitoring documentation, and verify end-user network access. Browser types Instrumentation is compatible with every browser type, including Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox, Microsoft Internet Explorer and Edge, and Apple Safari. The user interface is compatible with New Relic's supported browser versions. Exceptions Comments Paint timings The firstPaint and firstContentfulPaint attributes in BrowserInteraction, PageView, and PageViewTiming events are only compatible with: Chrome 60 or higher for desktop and mobile (Android webview and Chrome for Android) Opera 47 or higher for desktop Opera 44 or higher for Android mobile Samsung Internet for mobile AJAX AJAX timing features are not available with: Chrome for iPhone and iPad IE 7 and 8 PageAction events PageAction events require a browser that fully supports cross-domain XMLHttpRequests. Internet Explorer versions 9 and lower cannot record PageAction events. Learn more on querying your data. Session traces Session traces are reported only from browsers that support the Resource Timing Specification. SHA-256 New Relic can only monitor browsers that are compatible with SHA-256. APM agents You can deploy the browser agent for apps monitored by APM, or you can deploy the browser agent for your standalone apps. For more information, see the installation procedures. If you are deploying browser for an app using APM, make sure your agent supports browser monitoring: C SDK: Version 1.0.0 or higher Go: Version 2.5.0 or higher Java: Version 3.4.0 or higher .NET: Version 2.20.25.0 or higher Node.js: Version 1.4.0 or higher PHP: Version 4.4.5.35 or higher Python: Version 2.10.1.9 or higher Ruby: Version 3.7.0.177 or higher Supported frameworks The browser agent collects data on all front-end frameworks. However, the monitoring occurs on lower-level \"primitives\" that JavaScript frameworks use, so the level of detail collected by the instrumentation may vary depending on your specific framework. Exceptions Comments Zone.js If you're using AngularJS and you want to use our SPA monitoring features, note that Zone.js versions 0.6.18 to 0.6.24 are not compatible with browser. In all cases, the browser agent must be loaded before Zone.js to avoid errors. Cypress.io Browser is unable to properly instrument the open and send methods of requests when tests are run in Cypress. This will cause the following error to be thrown: Cannot set property 'status' of undefined Copy This will only affect customers running tests with the Browser agent present in their code. Production applications should not be affected. html2pdf.js This library is not compatible with our Pro+SPA agent due to the way this library wraps promises. If you're using this library, we recommend selecting the Pro agent type. Content Security Policy (CSP) considerations In order to obtain accurate browser performance metrics, browser requires the use of a small, inline JavaScript snippet. New Relic carefully reviews the inline JavaScript to prevent Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) and other potential vulnerabilities. Content Security Policy Level 2 adds restrictions to the types of JavaScript allowed, such as inline scripts. It also limits which domains can load scripts during page load. Important If your website does not allow any third-party hosted JavaScript to run, you must request a CSP exception via your organization’s standard procedures in order to install the browser monitoring agent. When requesting a CSP exception, follow your organization's standard procedures to contact your web or security team. The browser JavaScript agent requires the following CSP exceptions in order to run properly. Alternatively, you can add all of these exceptions to the fallback default-src directive (instead of script-src and connect-src). CSP exception Comments unsafe-inline Add to the script-src directive or to the fallback default-src directive. This is required because the agent is installed by including an inline script. https://js-agent.newrelic.com Add to the script-src directive or to the fallback default-src directive. This is where additional script files that the agent requires are hosted. https://bam.nr-data.net https://bam-cell.nr-data.net Important Add https://gov-bam.nr-data.net if you're using FedRAMP-compliant endpoints. Add to the script-src directive or to the fallback default-src directive. This is where the agent sends its collected data. One of the calls to this URL is a JSONP call, which means that the URL must be allowed as a script source. Add to the connect-src directive or to the fallback default-src directive. The connect-src directive affects the URLs that scripts can call (for example, using the XMLHttpRequest interface). If you have CSP restrictions specifically around this directive, then add this URL as an exception.",

Content Security Policy Level 2 adds restrictions to the types of JavaScript allowed, such as inline scripts. It also limits which domains can load scripts during page load. Important If your website does not allow any third-party hosted JavaScript to run, you must request a CSP exception via your organization’s standard procedures in order to install the browser monitoring agent. When requesting a CSP exception, follow your organization's standard procedures to contact your web or security team. The browser JavaScript agent requires the following CSP exceptions in order to run properly. Alternatively, you can add all of these exceptions to the fallback default-src directive (instead of script-src and connect-src). CSP exception Comments unsafe-inline Add to the script-src directive or to the fallback default-src directive. This is required because the agent is installed by including an inline script. https://js-agent.newrelic.com Add to the script-src directive or to the fallback default-src directive. This is where additional script files that the agent requires are hosted. https://bam.nr-data.net https://bam-cell.nr-data.net Important Add https://gov-bam.nr-data.net if you're using FedRAMP-compliant endpoints. Add to the script-src directive or to the fallback default-src directive. This is where the agent sends its collected data. One of the calls to this URL is a JSONP call, which means that the URL must be allowed as a script source. Add to the connect-src directive or to the fallback default-src directive. The connect-src directive affects the URLs that scripts can call (for example, using the XMLHttpRequest interface). If you have CSP restrictions specifically around this directive, then add this URL as an exception.",

The name will be exposed as the browserInteractionName attribute in the BrowserInteraction event. It will also be used for grouping in the UI. By default, browserInteractionName is named after an associated URL or route. Use setName() when you want to record an interaction that is not a route change or URL change. The setCurrentRouteName() method also names the current route. When you use both: setName() takes precedence for naming the interaction. The previousRouteName and targetRouteName attributes are still set with values passed to setCurrentRouteName(). Using these methods together allows many options for filtering and grouping in the UI. For example, you can: Filter down to interactions of a certain type, such as LikeButtonClick. Then, group by targetRouteName to see what routes have the most LikeButtonClick interactions. Tip This API call applies to data in SPA page views in browser and the BrowserInteraction event type within New Relic One. To set a custom name for standard page views and the PageView event type, see setPageViewName. Using both calls together is recommended. Parameters Parameter Description $name string Required.

When querying the PageView event, the custom name will be exposed as the browserTransactionName attribute. The custom name will also be visible in the browser monitoring UI. To use a customized page view name instead of the page URL, format the name as a slash-delimited string. Make this call before the window load event fires in order for it to appear correctly.

Using both calls together is recommended. Parameters Parameter Description $name string Required. The page name you want to use. Use alphanumeric characters. $host string Optional. Default is http://custom.transaction. Typically set host to your site's domain URI. To further group these custom transactions, provide a custom host. Otherwise, the page views will be assigned the default domain custom.transaction. Segments within the name must be explicitly added to your URL allow list settings if they do not already appear.

Requirements Agent version nr-963 or higher. Description This SPA monitoring method sets the name and trigger of a browser interaction. The name will be exposed as the browserInteractionName attribute in the BrowserInteraction event. It will also be used for grouping in the UI. By default, browserInteractionName is named after an associated URL or route. Use setName() when you want to record an interaction that is not a route change or URL change. The setCurrentRouteName() method also names the current route. When you use both: setName() takes precedence for naming the interaction. The previousRouteName and targetRouteName attributes are still set with values passed to setCurrentRouteName(). Using these methods together allows many options for filtering and grouping in the UI. For example, you can: Filter down to interactions of a certain type, such as LikeButtonClick. Then, group by targetRouteName to see what routes have the most LikeButtonClick interactions. Tip This API call applies to data in SPA page views in browser and the BrowserInteraction event type within New Relic One. To set a custom name for standard page views and the PageView event type, see setPageViewName. Using both calls together is recommended. Parameters Parameter Description $name string Required. If null, the name will be set using the targetGroupedUrl attribute. If not null, this will set the browserInteractionName attribute in the BrowserInteraction event. $trigger string Optional. If not null, this will set the TRIGGER attribute on the BrowserInteraction event. Return values This method returns the same API object created by interaction().

The name will be exposed as the browserInteractionName attribute in the BrowserInteraction event. It will also be used for grouping in the UI. By default, browserInteractionName is named after an associated URL or route. Use setName() when you want to record an interaction that is not a route change or URL change. The setCurrentRouteName() method also names the current route. When you use both: setName() takes precedence for naming the interaction. The previousRouteName and targetRouteName attributes are still set with values passed to setCurrentRouteName(). Using these methods together allows many options for filtering and grouping in the UI. For example, you can: Filter down to interactions of a certain type, such as LikeButtonClick. Then, group by targetRouteName to see what routes have the most LikeButtonClick interactions. Tip This API call applies to data in SPA page views in browser and the BrowserInteraction event type within New Relic One. To set a custom name for standard page views and the PageView event type, see setPageViewName. Using both calls together is recommended. Parameters Parameter Description $name string Required.

      "body": "Problem You have enabled distributed tracing but data you expected to see does not appear in New Relic's distributed tracing UI. Solution Important Before performing troubleshooting, we recommend reading How distributed tracing works. Here are some causes and solutions when you have problems finding expected data in the distributed tracing UI: Problems with enabling or instrumenting Missing spans due to service not having distributed tracing enabled In order for distributed tracing to report details for all nodes in a trace, each application must be monitored by a New Relic agent that has had distributed tracing enabled. If an application's New Relic account has not had distributed tracing enabled, it will have these issues: Its distributed tracing UI page won't have data. It won't report data to other accounts' distributed traces. Missing apps/services may require manual instrumentation When you enable distributed tracing for applications and services that New Relic automatically instruments, you'll usually see complete and detailed data for those nodes in the distributed tracing UI. However, you may notice that some services or applications are missing from traces, or that there are some internal spans you expect to see that are missing. If that's the case, you may want to implement custom instrumentation of applications or specific transactions to see more detail in traces. Some examples of when you may need to do this: Transactions not automatically instrumented. To ensure your application is automatically instrumented, read the compatibility and requirements documentation for the New Relic agent you're using. If an application isn't automatically instrumented, or if you'd like to add instrumentation of specific activity, see Custom instrumentation. All Go applications. The Go agent, unlike other agents, requires manual instrumentation of your code. For instructions, see Instrument a Go application. A service doesn't use HTTP. If a service doesn't communicate via HTTP, the New Relic agent won't send distributed tracing headers. This may be the case for some non-web applications or message queues. To remedy this, use the distributed tracing APIs to instrument either the calling or called application. Problems with spans Infinite Tracing: missing spans If your APM agent can’t write data fast enough to the trace observer, queue_size is an additional APM agent configuration to limit the number of spans the agent will hold. See the following examples for your agent: .NET configuration method Example Configuration file <configuration . . . > <infiniteTracing> <trace_observer> <span_events queue_size=\"100000\" /> </trace_observer> </infiniteTracing> </configuration> Copy Environment variable NEW_RELIC_INFINITE_TRACING_SPAN_EVENTS_QUEUE_SIZE=100000 Copy Python configuration method Example Configuration file infinite_tracing.span_queue_size = 100000 Environment Variable NEW_RELIC_INFINITE_TRACING_SPAN_QUEUE_SIZE = 100000 Missing span not getting exported Sometimes header propagation is successful, but the span information isn't getting sent to New Relic. For example, if OpenTelemetry is not instrumented with a New Relic exporter, the span details never make it to New Relic. In this diagram, notice that the header propagation is successful, but no exporter is set up in Service 2 to send the span to New Relic: The following diagram also shows successful header propagation, but it includes an exporter in Service 2 that sends the span details to New Relic (see Trace API): Missing spans due to sampling process Standard distributed tracing for APM uses adaptive sampling. This means that a percentage of calls to a service will be reported as part of a distributed trace. Specific calls to your service might not have been selected to be sampled. Missing spans due to span limits maxed out There are limits on the number of spans that can be collected and displayed. If an application generates a very large number of spans for a single call, it might exceed the APM agent's span-collection limit for that harvest cycle. This could result in missing spans and significantly limit the number of traces the agent can completely sample and report. We currently only show 10,000 spans at a time. Missing spans due to spans being sent late Spans must be sent within the last twenty minutes to be captured in a trace index. If you send any spans older than twenty minutes but newer than a day, the span data will still be written. However, it won't be rolled into the trace index, which controls the trace list in the distributed tracing UI. If a span has a timestamp older than a day, it will be dropped. This often occurs when there is clock skew (timing differences) between systems or long running background jobs. Problems with trace details Middleware doesn't recognize proprietary New Relic header If your transactions are only sending the proprietary New Relic header, some middleware might not recognize the format and then drop the information as shown in this diagram: One solution is to upgrade your New Relic agent to a version that supports W3C trace context. In the diagram below, the W3C-compliant New Relic agent passes the prior header along with two standardized headers: An intermediary is missing or isn't passing trace context Some potential problems with proxies and other intermediaries: Incomplete trace. Some intermediaries won't automatically propagate the distributed tracing header. In that case, you must configure that component to allow the header to be passed from source to destination. For instructions, consult the documentation for that intermediary component. Missing intermediary in trace. If the intermediary is New Relic-monitored, ensure that it propagates the newrelic header that is generated or updated by the New Relic agent running on that intermediary. This may manifest when an intermediary was previously visible in traces, but disappeared after distributed tracing was enabled for an upstream entity (for example, a browser-monitored application). Tip If some entities report trace data to another tracing system, you can use the trace ID from the New Relic UI to search other tracing systems for missing spans. Stitching together spans from mixed sources If each agent in a chain supports W3C Trace Context, then we can stitch the spans together into a complete trace. If part of the chain is from an agent, such as Zipkin, which doesn't support W3C Trace Context, then spans coming from that agent may not be included in the trace. Trace details are obfuscated If a trace contains data from applications monitored by multiple New Relic accounts, and your user permissions don't allow you to access those accounts, some of the span and service details will be obfuscated in the UI. For example, you may see a series of asterisks ( * * * * * ) instead of the service name in your distributed tracing list if you don't have access to the account linked with the service. Trace list information and trace details don't match The trace list is generated by trace indexes, which are captured in a twenty minute window from when the first spans are received. Usually, this is due to late spans. Long traces with short backend times If you're seeing unusually short backend times for long traces, this is likely an issue with the timestamps being sent. For example, the root span might be reposting microseconds as milliseconds. This can also happen if the root span is a browser application. When using an external client like a web browser, you may experience clock skew (timing differences) more often. Problems with browser applications Missing spans and transactions after enabling for a browser application Older versions of some APM agents are incompatible with distributed tracing for browser applications. If the browser application makes an AJAX request to an APM application running an incompatible agent, then the APM agent may not record transaction and span data for that request. If distributed tracing is enabled for a browser application and you are not seeing transaction or span data for downstream APM requests, review the browser data in distributed tracing requirements, and confirm that all applications are running supported versions of the APM agent. Not seeing browser app end-user spans If traces seem to be missing end-user spans, be sure you've read and understand the browser distributed tracing requirements and enable procedures. On the AJAX UI page, there are links to the distributed tracing UI regardless of whether there are end-user spans present in that trace. For details about what data generates spans, see Requirements. Browser spans are not connected to other spans Older versions of some APM agents are incompatible with distributed tracing for browser applications. If APM spans are missing consistently from traces that include browser applications, please refer to the browser data in distributed tracing requirements and confirm that all applications are running supported versions of the APM agent. For other causes of orphaned browser spans, see Browser span reporting. Other problems Search by entity.name not finding associated app names Potential cause: For applications that have multiple app names, the entity.name attribute will be associated only with the primary app name. To search by other app names, search using the appName attribute. Supporting OpenTelemetry Questions about integrating with OpenTelemetry should be taken to the Explorers Hub.",

For our Browser & APM Pro customers, you can now enable the Browser spans for any app that uses our Browser Pro + SPA agent. This MVP includes support for same-origin AJAX requests that originate during a BrowserInteraction event. This AJAX request will be listed as the root entry span for a trace. Learn More For more details about APM & Browser agent version requirements and enablement, see our Browser Data in Distributed Tracing Page. Please note that not all APM agents are supported at this time. For more details about all supported Span attributes, visit our Event Data Dictionary Known Issues Enabling Browser in Distributed Tracing for use with current versions of these language agents, Java, PHP, and C, will result in disconnected traces (single span traces for all Browser requests) and potentially the loss of APM transaction traces and spans. Please see the APM compatibility requirements for supported versions and estimated release dates. New PageViewTiming Event to capture User Centric Perceived Performance metrics in real time With this release, we are tying together the visual and responsiveness performance for our customer's site. With every page view, the agent is now capturing the time of the first interaction along with FID (First Input Delay). The existing paint timing metrics (First Paint and First Contentful Paint) are now collected even when they occur after the load event. All of these new metrics are captured on the new PageViewTiming events, available in Insights. This new event type is available for all agents, but requires a Browser Pro subscription. Visit our New Relic Event Data Dictionary for a list of attributes and more details about the PageViewTiming event. First Interaction First Interaction timing captures the moment in time that a user first engages with a site. Within this timing, we also capture the type of interaction (click, key, mousedown, etc). This timing represents the first step in calculating the First Input Delay, which is the time from First Interaction to the moment that the site responds (is interactive). First Input Delay FID is a metric that tracks the delay between the time a user can attempt to interact with a part of the site (for example, when they click a link, tap on a button, or use a custom, JavaScript-powered control), and the time that the interface is able to respond to that interaction. We have all experienced situations where a webpage has visibly loaded, but when we try to click around on buttons or any JavaScript-powered interactive elements, nothing responds. This delay is what the FID metric tracks. The FID metric is in some ways an intersection of the First Contentful Paint and Time to Interactive metrics. It lies in the middle of those two points, measuring the time between the FCP (and therefore when a first input can be made) and when the browser’s main thread is able to respond to any interactions. One major point of FID that differentiates it from Time to Interactive is that it requires a user to interact! TTI can be calculated without user input, so it is somewhat less powerful in the sense that it isn't providing any new information about my user's active experience or frustration, we can only assume that slow = bad. Why only consider the first input Learn more For more information and query examples, see our PageViewTiming event documentation. For more information about the Paint Timing browser compatibility, see the Browser compatibility and requirements documentation. For more information about User-Centric Perceived Performance metrics, visit the Google Developers Web Fundamentals Guides on Performance. For more information about the difference between FID and TTI, see When Users Click: Tracking First Input Delay Improvements Browser interactions now wait on external scripts to finish loading: Browser interactions measure the time of all Javascript code that runs as a result of an interaction. The agent now includes the time it takes to load and execute external scripts. This is useful, for example, when the code started by an interaction must be loaded first (lazy loading).

      "body": "With the Errors UI in New Relic One, you can see the line of code that's causing a bad experience for your users, and get enough data to reproduce the issue so you can fix it. When you do, you’ll be able to confirm your fix is working in production. Use Errors in New Relic One to: Group and filter events to triage important errors. Get alert notifications about errors. Review stack traces, logs, and other details. Share the error information with charts and dashboards. Report new errors using instrumentation, prevent certain errors from being reported, and filter out noisy errors using expected errors. View the APM Errors page Important As of October 1, 2021, the APM Errors (classic) UI will be discontinued in favor of the New Relic One APM Errors UI. For more details, see our Explorers Hub post. To view the Errors page: Go to one.newrelic.com > APM > (select an app), then click the Error rate table's title on your selected app's Summary page. OR Go to one.newrelic.com > APM > (select an app) > Events > Errors. APM Errors UI: The Error rate chart always shows the rate for all errors, even if a filter is applied. To drill down further, use grouping and filter options for the Top 5 by count chart and Error traces table. Use the Instance dropdown to focus on a specific instance. Use the Errors workflow to identify problems Use this basic workflow to get the most out of the information you see from the Errors page. Start with the Error rate chart to see at a glance whether there are any unexpected spikes, dips, or patterns with errors in general. Correlate any general patterns on the Top 5 errors chart to alerts occurring during the same time period. Use the groups and filters to examine the error events and attributes in more detail, and look for patterns with error messages, transaction names, or other groupings. Explore and share Error trace table information, including specific stack trace details, logs, and attributes (host, URL, user, custom attributes, etc.) Also review the Error profiles page to guide your investigation into which attribute values might be correlated to the cause of errors, by comparing the frequency of those values between transactions where the error did and didn't occur (only in the old UI). Error rate chart: See patterns immediately Start with the Error rate chart to see at a glance whether there are any unexpected spikes, dips, or patterns with errors in general. For example, are there any spikes near a recent deployment? You may want to change the selected time period to look for other historical patterns. This chart always shows the overall error rate and count for the selected time period, even when you filter the rest of the page. If you want to focus your investigation on a particular type of error, use the Top 5 errors chart or the Error traces table. Top five errors: Correlate to alerts or find significant groupings Use the Top 5 errors chart to identify what error types and how many of those errors occurred during the same time period as the Error rate chart. For example: Is the error spike related to a specific exception class or transaction? Do the top errors point to a new host/container that recently got moved into production? Are the top error messages repeatedly about failed connections by hosts that you know are in a specific region of your organization? Have the chart backgrounds changed color to indicate an alert condition? (Light pink indicates the alert condition's Warning threshold, and dark pink indicates the Critical threshold.) If you want to... Do this... Change the \"top 5\" selection By default, Top 5 errors chart shows the top five errors by error class and transaction name. To group by other attributes, such as error message, host, or custom attribute, use the search bar. Explore or share error trend data The Top 5 errors chart uses error events, which include rich attribute data b default, along with any custom attributes you have added to the error event type. To examine this data in more detail, or to share it with others, select the View query or Add to dashboard links that appear when you click the chart's ... menu. Error traces: Find the line of code and data needed to reproduce the issue The Error traces table groups errors by the attributes you've selected, and links them to relevant detailed error traces. Each row helps you find answers to questions such as: How many of this transaction/class (or custom grouping) occurred within the selected time period? What is the most recent error message? When did this error first and last occur? Sometimes it may be useful to sort error trace data other than from the most to fewest occurrences. You can change the sort order or filter options to focus on just the types of errors that matter the most to you and your teams. For example: Which error has the fewest occurrences (sort on Errors column)? When did a particular error stop (sort on Last occurred)? Once you find the group of errors you want to fix, click a row in the Error traces table to drill down into the stack traces and attribute data that help pinpoint the cause. Expected errors Reduce noisy errors by marking them as “expected errors”. Such errors won't affect reported error rate or Apdex metrics. See Manage errors for more details. Expected errors aren't shown by default on the Errors page. You can show them by turning on the Show N expected errors switch below the Group by bar. Errors outside transactions Using the New Relic agent API, you can record custom errors at any point in the execution of your code. Sometimes, such custom errors will occur when a transaction is not executing, such as in high-volume aynchronous code that doesn't handle an HTTP transaction. Errors outside transactions are shown by default on the Errors page, but you can hide them by turning off the Show N errors outside transactions switch below the Group by bar. Select the time period for error data Use the time picker to examine details of error events over the past week. The error events view is available for up to a seven-day window of data collected over the last eight days. You may notice slight differences in count if your time window is set to ending now. This occurs because the counts for the list and table may be requested at slightly different times as the page auto-refreshes.",

View HTTP error profiles To view mobile monitoring error profiles: Go to one.newrelic.com > Mobile > (select an app) > Network > HTTP errors. To see HTTP error profile details: At the bottom of the HTTP errors UI page, select the HTTP error profiles tab above the table, then select an HTTP error profile to expand it. What are HTTP error profiles? An HTTP error profile is a potentially meaningful correlation found between your HTTP error values (MobileRequestError events) when compared to successful HTTP requests (MobileRequest events). These correlations help you investigate the causes and contributing factors behind your HTTP errors. The screenshot below shows an example of an HTTP error profile. This HTTP error profile shows that a significant number of the HTTP errors occurring, 25%, are being caused by just 5 device types. To investigate further, you could use the filter to display a specific device type and see if there are other correlations, such as a specific OS version or carrier. You can also filter the data used to generate HTTP error profiles to help you narrow down potential causes. For an analysis of a specific HTTP error profile, see the example HTTP error profile explanation. Filter HTTP error profile data To further filter the data used to generate HTTP error profiles and their comparison page views, use these HTTP errors page features: Time picker: select a time range used to generate the data. Filter: use the filter to display only HTTP error profiles and page views that have the attribute values you choose. You can select multiple attribute values. Example HTTP error profile explanation To help you better understand your own HTTP error profile data, this is an explanation of an example HTTP error profile's data. This HTTP error profile example has had a filter of deviceType = Galaxy Device applied, so it is only showing HTTP error data from Galaxy devices. This example profile has had a filter applied so that it is only showing HTTP error data from Galaxy devices. Column explanations: The first column is the Errors column. It shows the attribute values with the most deviation when compared to successful HTTP requests. Less significant attribute values are aggregated in the Other category. In this example, the OS versions 6.0, 5.1, 7.0, and 7.1.1 make up 100% of the HTTP errors for Chrome users. The Errors column shows what percentage of MobileRequestError events have the attribute values from the first column. This column adds up to 100%, representing all HTTP errors from the chosen time range and filter set. In this example, a large percentage of HTTP errors are coming from Galaxy OS version 7.1.1. If we wanted to investigate this further, we could filter to only show OS version 7.1.1 data. The Requests column shows what percentage of MobileRequest events (successful HTTP requests) have the attribute values from the first column. In this example, less than 14% of the requests are made by users on OS version 6, but 24% of HTTP errors are generated by users with that version. The Difference column shows you the difference in percentage between the Errors column and the Requests column. In this example, the 11% indicates that attribute is 11 percentage points higher for HTTP error events than for requests.",

These metrics are analyzed to show how the data has behaved during the last five minutes compared to the prior hour. one.newrelic.com > Apps > New Relic Lookout: Anything that significantly deviates from the trend is automatically discovered by New Relic Lookout, which doesn't require any configuration. Circle visualization and table view Each application (or other facet) is represented by a circle. The size of the circles indicate the magnitude of the signal for that application and the color indicates whether the value has significantly decreased or increased in the last five minutes, based on the standard deviation of the prior hour (default evaluation and comparison time windows.) Please note that the type of signal is important when interpreting your results. When you first look at the legend below, you might be tempted to interpret yellow as good and dark purple as bad, but that is not always the case. Here are some examples: In the APM/services golden signals, a dark yellow circle in Throughput might signify that something bad has occurred and led to a drop in traffic. At the same time, a dark purple circle might also be concerning due to unexpected load. Both are significant findings worth exploring. In browser golden signals, a dark purple circle in Page Views might be great, as you are seeing more traffic to your site! With errors golden signals (in all entity types), a large circle, even if gray (not deviating from normal volume), is worth exploring because a high count of errors in your system is important to investigate. The legend allows you to change the colors used to highlight deviating services To change the color palette, click the gear icon by the low-high color legend. This allows you to change the colors used to highlight deviating services. To get a table view of the same data, click the toggle on the right. You can also hover over each color to filter the view by degree lower or higher deviance. Abnormal golden signals On the right, New Relic Lookout displays the most significantly deviating applications (or other facet) in a side panel, weighted by both the magnitude of the performance indicators and the scale of their deviations. Details include the name of the key performance indicator, their magnitude during the recent time window, and the difference between the averages from one time compared to the other. Instant search Click the magnifying glass icon in the side panel to open a search box. Typing into the search box filters the circles, table, and abnormal signals to applications (or other facets) that contain the text. This is a good way to quickly zoom to various subsystems. New Relic Lookout doesn't rerun the analysis when using the instant search. Change view Click the Change View button on the right side panel. The panel that appears shows you all the entity-specific golden signals you can toggle between out of the box. By choosing the Browser Golden Signal or other views, you can change from the default view. Each new view will have the golden signals appropriate for that entity type. Drill down into the details To analyze an application or facet, click a circle, table row, or abnormal golden signal. The details panel shows the degree of deviation of the performance indicator, a link to the affected entity, and recent alert and deployment activity for that entity, when available. There’s also an indication of whether the selected evaluation time period would be abnormal or not in reference to other comparison time windows, such as the same time yesterday or the same time last week. This allows you to quickly see if the abnormal behavior is odd in general, or just based on the comparison time window. Performance tab The default tab shows charts for other key performance indicators for the selected application or facet. The charts compare the two time windows being analyzed. You can click their titles to rerun the analysis, focusing on the selected key performance indicator. When the target is a New Relic One application, we show the top transactions, error classes, external services, and database operations, alongside links to the relevant New Relic One features. Abnormal History tab This section analyzes past performance of the selected signal and calls out any time periods with notable abnormalities. Each card represents an abnormal time window and can be clicked for more details. The charts will display any relevant violations and deployments in New Relic. Correlations tab New Relic Lookout can find other signals that began behaving differently around the same time as the selected signal for that entity type. Clicking the name of the signal reruns the analysis, focusing on that key performance indicator. The chart titles link to New Relic One when there’s an associated entity in your account. Note that correlations currently do not analyze across accounts. The correlated signals displayed are for others in the account of the original application you are viewing. This helps focus the data on correlations that are more likely related to your issue. Profile tab Based on the same technology as New Relic’s error profiles, this tab compares the last five minutes to the prior hour by default (or whatever time windows you’ve selected with query editing) and surfaces any attributes that have significantly different distributions in the events being targeted by the selected signal. For example, if a custom attribute indicated that a recent throughput spike came from one user, that would surface highly in Profiles if most of the traffic usually comes from many users. Traces tab If the entity has distributed traces configured and available in the selected evaluated time window, the Traces section is enabled. Each card shows a summary of a trace and can be clicked for details. The Explore all traces links to the distributed traces application, filtered to the selected entity. Create a custom view To target signals and time windows beyond the default values, click the Change view button and select Custom view. To create your own view: Select the account or subaccount. Select the data type (metrics or events). Different functionality is available depending on the type. In View a chart with, select the metric or event you are interested in. Default is golden signals (throughput, response time, and errors). You can also build custom queries (filters) to target a signal that isn't on the list. In Facet by, select what the circles represent. Default is appName, but you can also choose host or any other facetable attribute available for the signal you’ve selected. If you plan to save/favorite this new view, provide a name in the Name your view box. Keep in mind that you can edit this view at any time using the pencil icon. The default time windows analyzed by New Relic Lookout are the last five minutes compared to the hour before. Use the time controls (View data from and Compare data to) to target other time windows. one.newrelic.com > Apps > New Relic Lookout: All event and metric data in the New Relic database can be queried using the Edit query feature. Click Analyze to begin analyzing the signal you’ve selected. You can also create your own query: Create your query. This query is comparing data from the past thirty minutes to data from the same range a day ago. Change from Basic to Advanced after clicking the Custom view button. Select the data type (metrics or events). Different functionality is available depending on the type. Enter your query using NRQL. Please note that not all NRQL features are available in the Lookout Advanced query feature. By default, the system will run this query using the last five minutes of data compared to the previous hour. Some examples of the syntax for changing the comparison and evaluation time windows are below. Click Analyze to begin analyzing the signal you’ve selected. Query: Compare the last 15 minutes to the same time 1 day ago Please note that the UNTIL NOW portion is required here unlike in standard NRQL. Without the UNTIL NOW added, the system will query a 5 minute slice of data starting 15 minutes ago SINCE 15 minutes AGO UNTIL NOW COMPARE WITH 1 day ago Copy Query: Compare a specific time range to the same range a month ago SINCE '2021-03-07 07:00:00-0500' UNTIL '2021-03-08 07:00:00-0500' COMPARE WITH 1 month ago Copy Or: SINCE 'today at midnight' UNTIL 'now' COMPARE WITH 1 MONTH AGO Copy Example: Unusual increases in error count The default view of New Relic Lookout shows application status across your estate, comparing the last five minutes to the hour before. Under regular operation, most large systems may have a handful of abnormalities, but usually most things will indicate normal behavior. Suddenly, several circles begin to change to red under the Errors section. This indicates that several applications are experiencing unusual increases in error count. It may be that one or two circles for important systems are red, and perhaps much larger than they usually appear. Clicking one of these can provide more information on what is happening. You might see that the error rate is substantially elevated, even thousands of percent higher than normal. To troubleshoot this issue, here's what you might discover in the New Relic Lookout tabs: Performance would show you data about other signals, illuminating the characteristics of the change in system dynamics. Correlations would surface other applications that are affected and how, as well as opportunities to pivot to other applications that may be closer to the underlying causes. Traces, in turn, would show distributed traces, which can provide specific examples of traffic running through those systems. Abnormal history would show other times in the past week with elevated errors, showing whether or not this problem happens regularly, such as every day at the same time or whenever there is a deployment. Profiles might show that all or most of the new errors share common properties, such as all being isolated to just one region/account/user. Combining the information from these sections, not only can you get a sense of what is going on, but also where to focus actions to resolve the problem.",

Examine error details Select an error from the main page to view detailed information about that error, such as the top five browsers that error occurred on, the top five devices it occurred on, and associated URIs. Select Error instances to see event logs and stack traces, if available. Examine events leading up to error The Event log shows the browser interactions, AJAX calls, and traces that led up to an error. Decode your minified JavaScript If your JavaScript is minified, the errors on the JS errors page may not be very useful. To decode minified JavaScript and make these error stack traces more useful, you can upload JavaScript source maps to New Relic. one.newrelic.com > Browser > (select an app) > JS errors: Use this page to group and filter errors, explore stack trace details, and examine trends. (If your UI page looks different, you may be using an older, deprecated UI.) Query and visualize JS data New Relic saves JS errors as event data. This allows you to query your error data in the query builder. To run NRQL queries and create dashboards to view or share, query the JavaScriptError event type in the query builder. Use API to monitor handled errors To notice or log your app's handled errors or other miscellaneous errors, use the browser API's noticeError call. Review event logs Important SPA monitoring must be enabled. The event log shows the browser interactions, AJAX calls, and traces that led up to a JS error. This can help you troubleshoot the root cause of errors. one.newrelic.com > Browser > (select an app) > JS errors > (select an error) > Error instances: With SPA monitoring enabled, the event log shows you the activity leading up to an error. To view the Event log (if available): Go to one.newrelic.com > Browser > (select an app) > JS errors > (select an error) > Error instances. The event log will not be visible if there are no events in the event log. For example, if a JS error is occurring after an AJAX request that provides an error message, it could be that your AJAX request doesn't contain the right information. This results in a JS error due to a failed AJAX call. Troubleshoot missing event logs Some reasons for events in the event log not being present: Agent version. To capture event log data your site must have SPA monitoring enabled (browser agent version 1071 or higher). JS error not part of a browser interaction. If the JS error occurs outside of an interaction, the related browser interaction details cannot be captured (for example: if an async JS file experiences an error). A click triggered the JS error. In some cases if the error is a direct result of a click, no associated interactions are captured. Without event logs or stack traces, you can use the error detail charts to analyze the impact the error has by browser type, device type, and URI. View stack traces Stack traces can show you if an error is breaking important functionality, or if it's a less important error. To view an error's stack trace (if available): go to one.newrelic.com > Browser > (select an app) > JS errors > (select an error) > Error instances. Troubleshoot missing stack traces Some reasons why you may not see a stack trace for an error: If errors are not thrown, they will not produce a stack trace. The JS script is hosted on a CDN or another external location, and New Relic can't see the errors originating from those scripts. This can be solved in some cases by using cross-origin resource sharing (CORS). It is an AngularJS error. For more on this, see Missing Angular errors. The error is a SyntaxError or Script error: These occur while the script is loading, so they do not produce a stack trace. Some older browsers may generate errors without a stack trace, or may provide a stack trace that is not usable. You've captured the error before the New Relic agent sees it. If the error occurs during multiple harvest cycles in the same user visit, only error events reported during the first harvest cycle will have a stack trace recorded. Some solutions for reporting stack traces: Use the noticeError API call. Enable development mode. Use the JS errors UI page to get more information, including the event log. The JS errors page is designed to give you actionable information even without a stack trace. Global and generic errors New Relic wraps JavaScript functions to get information about thrown errors via the stack trace. If errors aren't thrown, they won't be available. For example, if you have an AngularJS application, follow the troubleshooting procedures when AngularJS errors do not appear in the UI. For some older browsers, the following errors may be unavailable: SyntaxError or Script error: These occur while the script is loading, so they do not produce a stack trace. In-line JavaScript or event handler errors: These are unwrapped. Errors thrown from third-party scripts that reside on another domain are not available. Errors occurring on older browsers: These may not be able to provide a usable stack trace. In some cases, they may not provide a stack trace at all. Error collection is done by wrapping JavaScript functions, so errors thrown by the browser at a lower level (such as cross-origin resource sharing errors) also are not available.",

Before you install the browser agent, make sure your system meets these requirements. Want to try out our browser monitoring? Create a New Relic account for free! No credit card required. Basic requirements To report data to browser, your application must at a minimum meet two basic requirements: The traffic to the application must be from clients able to load and execute browser JavaScript code and set cookies. Clients accessing the application must be able to send data to New Relic through HTTP requests. HTTPS is required for browser Pro features. Important Browsers that subscribe to a disconnect list or that use content filtering extensions such as AdBlock may not be able to send data to New Relic. For example, if you are using the Enhanced Tracking Prevention disconnect list for Mozilla Firefox 69.0 or higher, you will need to change the default configuration. Most typical browser applications meet these requirements. However, browser applications in restricted environments may have difficulty reporting data to New Relic; for example: Hybrid mobile applications Applications installed on unusual hardware, such as point-of-sale terminals or consumer appliances For more information, review the instrumentation for browser monitoring documentation, and verify end-user network access. Browser types Instrumentation is compatible with every browser type, including Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox, Microsoft Internet Explorer and Edge, and Apple Safari. The user interface is compatible with New Relic's supported browser versions. Exceptions Comments Paint timings The firstPaint and firstContentfulPaint attributes in BrowserInteraction, PageView, and PageViewTiming events are only compatible with: Chrome 60 or higher for desktop and mobile (Android webview and Chrome for Android) Opera 47 or higher for desktop Opera 44 or higher for Android mobile Samsung Internet for mobile AJAX AJAX timing features are not available with: Chrome for iPhone and iPad IE 7 and 8 PageAction events PageAction events require a browser that fully supports cross-domain XMLHttpRequests. Internet Explorer versions 9 and lower cannot record PageAction events. Learn more on querying your data. Session traces Session traces are reported only from browsers that support the Resource Timing Specification. SHA-256 New Relic can only monitor browsers that are compatible with SHA-256. APM agents You can deploy the browser agent for apps monitored by APM, or you can deploy the browser agent for your standalone apps. For more information, see the installation procedures. If you are deploying browser for an app using APM, make sure your agent supports browser monitoring: C SDK: Version 1.0.0 or higher Go: Version 2.5.0 or higher Java: Version 3.4.0 or higher .NET: Version 2.20.25.0 or higher Node.js: Version 1.4.0 or higher PHP: Version 4.4.5.35 or higher Python: Version 2.10.1.9 or higher Ruby: Version 3.7.0.177 or higher Supported frameworks The browser agent collects data on all front-end frameworks. However, the monitoring occurs on lower-level \"primitives\" that JavaScript frameworks use, so the level of detail collected by the instrumentation may vary depending on your specific framework. Exceptions Comments Zone.js If you're using AngularJS and you want to use our SPA monitoring features, note that Zone.js versions 0.6.18 to 0.6.24 are not compatible with browser. In all cases, the browser agent must be loaded before Zone.js to avoid errors. Cypress.io Browser is unable to properly instrument the open and send methods of requests when tests are run in Cypress. This will cause the following error to be thrown: Cannot set property 'status' of undefined Copy This will only affect customers running tests with the Browser agent present in their code. Production applications should not be affected. html2pdf.js This library is not compatible with our Pro+SPA agent due to the way this library wraps promises. If you're using this library, we recommend selecting the Pro agent type. Content Security Policy (CSP) considerations In order to obtain accurate browser performance metrics, browser requires the use of a small, inline JavaScript snippet. New Relic carefully reviews the inline JavaScript to prevent Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) and other potential vulnerabilities. Content Security Policy Level 2 adds restrictions to the types of JavaScript allowed, such as inline scripts. It also limits which domains can load scripts during page load. Important If your website does not allow any third-party hosted JavaScript to run, you must request a CSP exception via your organization’s standard procedures in order to install the browser monitoring agent. When requesting a CSP exception, follow your organization's standard procedures to contact your web or security team. The browser JavaScript agent requires the following CSP exceptions in order to run properly. Alternatively, you can add all of these exceptions to the fallback default-src directive (instead of script-src and connect-src). CSP exception Comments unsafe-inline Add to the script-src directive or to the fallback default-src directive. This is required because the agent is installed by including an inline script. https://js-agent.newrelic.com Add to the script-src directive or to the fallback default-src directive. This is where additional script files that the agent requires are hosted. https://bam.nr-data.net https://bam-cell.nr-data.net Important Add https://gov-bam.nr-data.net if you're using FedRAMP-compliant endpoints. Add to the script-src directive or to the fallback default-src directive. This is where the agent sends its collected data. One of the calls to this URL is a JSONP call, which means that the URL must be allowed as a script source. Add to the connect-src directive or to the fallback default-src directive. The connect-src directive affects the URLs that scripts can call (for example, using the XMLHttpRequest interface). If you have CSP restrictions specifically around this directive, then add this URL as an exception.",

To install the browser agent, you can choose from a number of deployment options. If you don't have one already, create a New Relic account. It's free, forever. Enable browser monitoring Browser Pro+SPA is the default agent when you enable browser monitoring. This automatically gives you access to all of our browser monitoring features. For more information about the browser monitoring options, see Browser agent types in this document. To enable browser monitoring: Go to one.newrelic.com, select Browser, and then select Add more data. Follow the instructions in the UI to add browser monitoring to your app. Generate some traffic for your app, then wait a few minutes for data to appear in New Relic. Optional: After installation is complete and you are seeing data, go to the App settings page for additional agent configuration, or to change the browser agent type. It may take several minutes after enabling the browser monitoring agent before your webpage data appear in New Relic. If have problems, follow our troubleshooting tips. Deployment options No matter which option you use to deploy browser monitoring, the end result is the same: the browser monitoring JavaScript snippet (also referred to as the \"agent\") is inserted into your app pages. The method you select depends on your preferences and business needs. Enable an APM-monitored app When enabling browser monitoring, you can use an APM agent to automatically inject the browser monitoring JavaScript snippet for you. This is the easiest way to install the agent for an app that's already being monitored by APM. APM-monitored apps are listed on your APM Applications index. Enable with copy/paste When enabling browser monitoring, you can manually insert the JavaScript snippet into your app's webpages. The copy/paste option gives you control over the exact placement of our JavaScript snippet, which is required to monitor the webpage's performance. This is useful for: Standalone apps, static sites, and cached pages delivered by CDN APM apps that are not as closely coupled to the browser app as with a standard server-side app (for example, when your client-side app talks to a REST API back end) Some tips for using the JavaScript snippet: Placement in your webpage: Copy the code snippet, then paste it inline into your pages as close to the top of the <head> element as possible, but after any position-sensitive <meta> tags (for example, X-UA-Compatible or charset information). For more information on the inline head placement, see JavaScript placement requirements. License key and app ID: Near the bottom of the generated JavaScript is your browser license key and application ID. This is useful with the REST API and API Explorer. Instrument webpages using the APM agent This information applies to apps that are also monitored by APM. Our APM agents can instrument webpages with the required JavaScript for page load timing. If you are using an APM agent's API to manually add the JavaScript snippet to your webpages, insert the instrumentation snippet as close to the top as possible. This allows you to take advantage of detailed information about browser's AJAX calls and JavaScript errors. For more information, see the instructions for your APM agent: C SDK Go Java .NET Node.js PHP Python Ruby Use REST API This information applies to apps that are also monitored by APM. The REST API lets you manage deployment outside the browser monitoring UI. This is useful for large organizations deploying multiple apps. Browser agent types: Lite, Pro, Pro+SPA We have three types of browser agents: Lite, Pro, and Pro+SPA. The agent type has no impact on your billing. Browser agent type Comparison Pro+SPA This is the default installed agent when you enable browser monitoring. What it includes: Gives you access to all of the Browser Pro features and to Single Page App (SPA) monitoring. Provides detailed page timing data and the most up-to-date New Relic features, including distributed tracing, for all types of applications. Pro+SPA is not limited only to single page applications. After install, you can downgrade anytime to the less advanced agents if you don't want or need SPA monitoring. Pro What it includes: Gives you access to the Browser Pro features. What it doesn't include: Lacks the functionality designed for single page app monitoring. Lite What it includes: Gives you information about some basic page load timing and browser user information. What it doesn't include: Lacks the Browser Pro features and SPA features. Details about how agent types relate to pricing: New Relic One pricing: This pricing plan has data ingest as a billing factor. If you want to reduce data ingest, you may want to consider downgrading to lesser agent types after install. Original pricing: Your access to browser monitoring features is gated by your subscription plan, not by the agent type. This means there is no reason not to use the default Pro+SPA agent. After initial agent installation is finished, you can go to the App settings page to edit your configuration or to change your subscription.",

      "body": "Your end-user experience depends on your entire technology stack. You need to quickly understand what's causing a customer complaint or issue. Did the problem come from your infrastructure, your application, or the browsers that ultimately render it? Is it the result of a problematic internet provider, a problem in your own data center with failing CPU or memory, or something else? More than Real User Monitoring (RUM) Many websites contain dynamic content that is loaded after the initial page has finished loading, and complex JavaScript code increases the need for error reporting. Browser monitoring in New Relic One provides a Real User Monitoring (RUM) solution that measures the speed and performance of your end users as they navigate to your site from different web browsers, devices, operating systems, and networks. With browser monitoring in New Relic One, you see actionable data about your end users' experience with your app. But browser monitoring in New Relic goes far beyond the initial page load to measure full page life cycle data. For example, our browser UI shows you: Actual performance data, such as by page view popularity and user satisfaction (Apdex) scores Perceived performance data that measures how quickly your async or dynamic visuals and interactive page contents display JavaScript error analytics, stack traces, and line-of-code visibility, to show you the end-user steps leading up to an error itself Session performance with a detailed timeline and heat map of the load and interaction events during a webpage's full life cycle AJAX requests indicating problems with timing, end points, and specific locations in the webpage Hash-based route changes in apps with single-page application (SPA) architectures These tools (and more!) help your teams optimize your end users' page load experience, eliminate bugs, and troubleshoot faster across your full stack. Examine user perceptions Real user data gives insights into actual page performance, but you also need to look into your users' perception of your site's performance. Pages can load content in many different ways, and users control when they interact with that content. This is why some user-centric performance metrics happen outside the standard window onload (page load time) in the browser monitoring agent. The PageViewTiming event provides a more real-time delivery mechanism that does not have a dependency on any other event. Additional metrics include: First paint, first contentful paint, and largest contentful paint First input delay First interaction This helps you understand how users experience your site, both from visual and responsiveness standpoints. Improve interactive app performance Our single-page app (SPA) monitoring automatically tracks route changes, initial page loads, and synchronous and asynchronous activity during browser interactions. You can also use our browser agent and SPA API to monitor virtually anything that executes inside the browser. If you are a developer, SPA monitoring can help you: Create faster, more responsive, highly interactive apps. Monitor the throughput and performance that real users are experiencing. Troubleshoot and resolve problems within the context of the page load. Query and visualize the data to assist with business decisions. Bring better apps to the marketplace more quickly. Correlate front-end and back-end problems With New Relic One, you can instrument any type of data you need, such as metrics, events, logs, and traces. This helps you find actionable data about your end users' experience across the stack. For example: Full-Stack Observability Comments Locations or domains Limit browser monitoring to focus on specific geographical locations or specific types of end-user activity. You can also monitor or block specific domains. Trends in interactions Use our comparative charting feature for a direct page load time comparison between real user (browser) interactions and trends appearing in Synthetic monitors. Distributed tracing Isolate latency from the web browser through back-end services with distributed tracing. The UI helps you see the connection across across a full transaction, from browser activity, to time spent in network, to back-end activity. Browser types Explore your end users' experience with your app segmented by any types of browsers they use, including: Top browsers by throughput Average page load time by platform type (mobile, desktop, and other) Selected browser type by version (for example, Chrome 31, 32, 33, etc.) This helps you quickly determine whether problems with page load timing may be related to a specific browser type or platform, or whether the problem is more widespread. Get started with browser monitoring Follow these basic steps, and you'll quickly be up and running in New Relic with browser monitoring! Review the compatibility details and basic requirements for browser monitoring. Install the browser agent. Go to [one.newrelic.com > Explorer > Browser applications. Use the Explorer to access all your entities, that is, anything we can identify that reports data, from applications and hosts to custom groupings of any elements. View summary data from your Browser summary page, then drill down into page load timing details and other UI data. Configure your alerts for key performance data, or use our Applied Intelligence solutions to reduce alert noise, correlate incidents, and automatically detect anomalies. Query and visualize your default data (or customize your own), then analyze what that data says about your business. Customize and share your own charts and dashboards.",

      "body": "Browser monitoring supports the uploading of source maps. Source maps support is primarily useful for \"decoding\" minified JavaScript. Minified JavaScript results in mostly useless error stack traces on browser's JS errors page. Uploading source maps converts these errors to understandable stack traces, with useful references to code lines. This feature might also be useful for bundled or transpiled JavaScript code. Browser gives you two options for using source maps: Upload source maps via the browser UI Publish source maps to browser via the API This document will explain the first method: how to upload source maps via the UI, along with general troubleshooting help. For instructions on using the API method, see Push source maps via the API. Import source maps via the New Relic UI You can drag and drop, or upload, a source map file into the browser UI to associate it with a specific JavaScript file. New Relic will then convert minified stack traces into un-minified traces and source code visible on the JS errors page. To drag in or upload a source map to browser, the source map must be on your local machine. To associate a source map with an error stack trace on the JS errors page: Go to one.newrelic.com > Browser > (select an app) > JS Errors, then select a JS error group. (Don't select an Errors without a stack trace group.) From the selected JS error group, select the error instance details tab (next to the Summary tab). Error groupings will have one or more frames listed that reference JavaScript files. Select the + icon on the right side of a frame to expand it. Then drag the matching source map file into the frame. Alternative option: when the frame is expanded, select find file to upload the file manually. Tip An error frame with a gray strip on the left side indicate minified JS; a blue strip indicates it has had a source map applied. Other JS error frame features include: If you want to... Do this... See more of the surrounding code Select Show 10 more lines above/below to view the code before or after the code in the stack trace. See original, minified file information For individual frame info: Next to the frame's source line and column, mouse over the ellipsis. For raw data of the entire stack trace: At the top of the error tab, select < /> Raw. Remove a source map From an expanded stack trace frame, select Remove file. Troubleshooting Stack traces are still minified If you have uploaded source maps to New Relic and still see minified stack traces, there are a few things to check. Using the API is the best way to investigate potential issues, by listing or deleting published source maps. Typical problems Troubleshooting tips URL mismatch Each frame in the stack trace is associated with a specific JavaScript URL. That URL must match the JavaScript URL that was used when publishing the source map. Ensure that these URLs match exactly. Release name/ID mismatch If the JavaScript URL is not versioned when you deploy your front end assets, a release name and release ID must be specified using the newrelic.addRelease API method, and also when publishing your source maps. Ensure that these strings match exactly. 409 error: Combination of javascriptUrl, releaseName, and releaseId must be unique If a source map file for a particular JavaScript URL is uploaded without a release name or ID specified, New Relic treats the URL as a unique identifier. To resolve this, delete the source map that has NULL release name and ID values and re-upload all versions for that URL including those parameters. This will allow multiple versions of source maps for a particular JS URL. Missing SourcesContent component Your mapping file must contain the SourcesContent component for New Relic to un-minify your stack traces. If you have uploaded your map successfully and are still not seeing un-minified code, check the original source map for this component. If you can't find it, regenerate the source map so the component is included, and upload your map to New Relic. If the SourcesContent component is not added, an error similar to Whoops, that was the wrong file. Please try again. will appear. Can't generate source maps Having trouble even generating source maps? Every build system has its own instructions for generating source maps. For more specific details, please see the documentation for your particular tool. Below are source map generation instructions for two popular build systems: Generate source maps with UglifyJS Generate source maps using UglifyJS: When \"uglifying\" source files, specify a source map file name and include the original source content: Starting on version v3.12.5: uglifyjs [source files] \\ -o bundle.min.js \\ -c -m --source-map \"includeSources=true\" Copy For older versions: uglifyjs [source files] \\ -o bundle.min.js \\ --source-map bundle.min.js.map \\ --source-map-include-sources \\ -c -m Copy Generate source maps with webpack Generate source maps using Webpack: In your production webpack config, simply specify source-map for the config.devtool property. The sourceMapFilename property of config.output is optional and defaults to [name].js.map. devtool: 'source-map', output: { path: path.join(__dirname, 'dist'), filename: '[name].js', sourceMapFilename: '[name].js.map', }, Copy",

      "body": "By default, mobile monitoring enables crash reporting for your mobile applications to help track and diagnose crashes. When an Android application crashes, the agent uploads a crash report to the New Relic collector. The crash details will then be processed and de-obfuscated automatically if you are using ProGuard or DexGuard. You can view detailed information about crashes in the Crash analysis UI, or receive crash notifications by email. You can also explore the crash data deeper with New Relic Insights, or integrate with ticketing systems for further investigation. Upload the ProGuard or DexGuard file The Android agent supports ProGuard and DexGuard. DexGuard is an extension to ProGuard, and it behaves the same as ProGuard when dealing with crash symbolication and obfuscated code maps. ProGuard obfuscates your code by renaming classes, fields, and methods with semantically obscure labels. DexGuard adds another additional layer of obfuscation and security, but otherwise behaves identically to ProGuard. If ProGuard or DexGuard is enabled, the stack trace produced by a crash consists only of these obfuscated labels, which are not human-readable. Follow the SDK installation or upgrade instructions to configure ProGuard or DexGuard and enable crash reporting. Be sure to create the newrelic.properties file containing your application token. Use mapping.txt file The agent uses the mapping.txt file produced during a ProGuard/DexGuard-enabled build. This file consists of the obfuscated label names, and provides reverse mapping between obfuscated and plain text labels. You must use the copy of mapping.txt generated during the build that produced your final application. The application's build ID changes each time an APK is generated, and the build ID in the mapping file must match the ID contained in each uploaded crash report. After you create a newrelic.properties file containing your New Relic app token in your project, the ProGuard or DexGuard mapping.txt file will be uploaded automatically after each build. Exception If either of the following situations occur, you must manually upload the mapping.txt replacement file: If the mapping.txt file is renamed using the DexGuard -printmapping option, the Android agent will be unable to locate or upload the stripped names. If you see obfuscated crash reports in the Crashes page, you may not have a mapping.txt file uploaded. Map Processing Important Agent version 5.27.0 introduces changes to the way the agent plugin process maps during builds. Maps are reported for select variant builds The agent will tag and report only those mapping.txt files generated by Release build-type variants. This behavior can be configured or disabled through the New Relic Gradle Plugin extension. Variants are assigned unique build IDs During an execution of a Gradle build, a single unique ID (build ID) was generated to represent all variants of the app built during that invocation. This often led to mismatched crash reports for customers using variants to customize a common app code base. Each variant is now identified by its own unique ID, which is used when reporting the variant's ProGuard map to New Relic. You can disable this behavior through the New Relic Gradle Plugin extension. Compress maps prior to upload As apps get larger, so do their associated maps, which then results in longer upload times when reporting the map. If map reporting time is unreasonably long, the agent can compress the map prior to transfer. To enable compressed map uploads, add the following to your app's newrelic.properties file: com.newrelic.compressed_uploads=true Copy Deferred crash reporting Important Agent version 6.0.0 introduces changes to the way the agent plugin processes crashes at runtime. In an attempt to address crash report duplication, deferred crash reporting is now the default crash reporting behavior. In this case, crash reports are recorded when they occur, but they're not uploaded until the next application launch. The previous crash reporting behavior is still available: uploading the crash as soon as it occurs before the application process terminates. You can use the NewRelic.withCrashReportingEnabled(boolean) API method. For example: NewRelic .withApplicationToken(\"<appToken>\") .withCrashReportingEnabled(true) .start(this.getApplication()); Copy Disable crash reporting If you want to use another crash reporting tool, you can disable crash reporting by calling NewRelic.disableFeature(FeatureFlag.CrashReporting) prior to agent initialization. For example: NewRelic.disableFeature(FeatureFlag.CrashReporting); NewRelic .withApplicationToken(\"<appToken>\") .start(this.getApplication()); Copy Debug the crash reporter Crash reporting for Android is designed to work with other crash reporting frameworks by chaining the uncaught exception handler if it is already registered. If no other framework has been found (or if New Relic is the first framework registered), the debug logs will include: Installing New Relic crash handler. Copy If another handler is already registered, debug logs will include: Installing New Relic crash handler and chaining previous exception handler. Copy Every time New Relic catches an exception, it is logged to DEBUG level. For example: A crash has been detected in <className>. Copy If New Relic catches an exception but crash reporting has been disabled for any reason, this message is logged: A crash has been detected but crash reporting is disabled. Copy If you don't see crash reports, check the debug logs for messages like this. Manually upload a ProGuard or DexGuard map file In some unusual circumstances, it may not be possible to automatically upload the ProGuard or DexGuard mapping file. This is often due to incorrectly creating a newrelic.properties file containing your application token. This will result in build errors or warnings with detailed log messages. To manually upload a ProGuard or DexGuard map file: Find the mapping.txt file(s) in the project's build directory For example, the file is located in the <PROJECT_ROOT>/app/build/outputs/mapping/<BUILD_VARIANT> directory for projects that use Android Studio. Generally, a release variant is used when building the final version of the application. The following command is useful for finding map files: find <project_root> -name mapping.txt Copy Using a command terminal, upload the ProGuard or DexGuard mapping file: For a US account: curl -v -F upload=@\"<mapping.txt>\" -H \"X-APP-LICENSE-KEY:<APPLICATION_TOKEN>\" https://mobile-symbol-upload.newrelic.com/symbol Copy For a EU account: curl -v -F upload=@\"<mapping.txt>\" -H \"X-APP-LICENSE-KEY:<APPLICATION_TOKEN>\" https://mobile-symbol-upload.eu.newrelic.com/symbol Copy Replace the following in your command: <mapping.txt> is the full path to the ProGuard or DexGuard mapping.txt file. <APPLICATION_TOKEN> is your mobile monitoring application token.",

      "body": "Here is information about using the legacy APM service maps feature to create, customize, and use service maps. For help using the current service maps feature, see How to use service maps. Requirements The legacy service map features in APM depend on your New Relic agent version: Feature Requirements App visibility For your app to appear in service maps, one of the following must be true: Your app must have the minimum agent version required for distributed tracing and have distributed tracing enabled. Note: Mobile monitoring doesn't support distributed tracing yet and will not show relationships to apps that have distributed tracing enabled. Your app must have the minimum APM agent version required for cross app tracing and have cross app tracing enabled. Host and instance visibility To view specific hosts, instances, and types of database information, your agent must meet the same minimum agent versions as the APM database and instance feature and use any of the compatible database drivers. Database-only visibility APM's service maps feature includes the ability to opt out of the deeper, host and instance level view. However, to view databases in service maps without the instance-level details, you must still meet the same minimum agent versions as the Database and slow queries features. Create maps The APM service maps feature helps you create your first map by providing default map or architecture suggestions that automatically build a default map (if you have more than ten reporting apps). To view these suggested maps, go to one.newrelic.com > More > Service Maps > Suggested maps. To create a new map: Do one of the following: Start from scratch: Go to one.newrelic.com > More > Service maps > Map list > Create new map . Copy an existing map: Go to one.newrelic.com > More > Service maps > (select a map) > Save as new. Name your map. Rearrange, group, or add nodes on the map as needed. Important Previously, you could have private service maps. Now, all users can view, edit, and delete all existing or new service maps in the account. Save and rename maps Here are some tips about saving and renaming maps: Save To save changes to a map, select Save. To create a copy of the current map, select Save as new. Rename To rename a map: Go to one.newrelic.com > More > Service maps > (select a map). Select the pencil icon next to the map name. Change the name, then select Save. Add or remove nodes on maps After you create or save a map, build out your map by adding nodes to it. Nodes are added to the map differently based on the node type. To remove any node from the map, mouse over the node, then select the remove X icon. Applications and mobile apps Nodes for applications or mobile apps need to be added to the map in order to add any other nodes. Nodes are added and connected into the map as you select them. The check mark icon means that node is already on the map. To add New Relic monitored apps or plugins to maps: Go to one.newrelic.com > More > Service maps > (select a map) > App/Service. Select any applications from the App/Service list. Rearrange or group together as needed. Browser, databases, external services, connected apps In the New Relic UI, your out-of-process services are referred to as web external or background external data. To add browser apps, databases, external services, or other connected apps to the map: Select an incoming or outgoing connection widget.

Add maps and charts to dashboards one.newrelic.com > Dashboards: adding a service map to a dashboard provides context for the data being reported and where it's coming from. You can add legacy service maps to a dashboard. For example, if you have a dashboard showcasing performance metrics for several entities, adding a service map to the dashboard shows how all the entities are related and provides additional context about your system. To add a service map to a dashboard: Go to one.newrelic.com and select the Explorer. Select an entity from the index. Click on Service map. Click Add to dashboard. Search for the dashboard you want to add the map to. Delete maps To delete a map: Go to one.newrelic.com > More > Service maps > (select a map). Select the map name's pencil icon. Select Delete map. Identify issues with external services If your app connects to an external service that New Relic does not monitor (for example, a third-party API), New Relic watches the service for a week in order to baseline its response time. If New Relic can collect a statistically significant number of data points (more than 100), New Relic compares the current response time to this baseline and uses this to set the health status indicator: Green: Response time from the service is less than 1.75 times the baseline. Yellow: Response time from the service is longer than 1.75 times the baseline. Red: Response time from the service is longer than 2.5 times the baseline. Gray: Alerts concluded it does not have enough data to determine the health status. Purple: Alerts cannot yet conclude if it has enough data to determine the health status. Visualize and monitor complex architectures Use service maps to visualize and monitor complex architectures. For a tutorial introducing the latest features, select the service map's question icon. Nodes Nodes are the basic building blocks for your map. You can add a variety of node types including: Node type Description New Relic APM-monitored app Add your app to the map to view their connections to databases, browser apps, out-of-process services, and other instrumented apps. (In the New Relic UI, your out-of-process services are also referred to as web external or background external data.) Browser apps Automatically detected for each app and added via the incoming connections widget. Only displays browser apps linked to an APM app (standalone browser apps are not supported). New Relic mobile monitoring apps Automatically detected and added via the app/service list panel. Plugins, including Databases Automatically detected for each app and added via the connections widget. Databases in service maps require the same agent versions as the new Database page features. External services Service maps automatically detects external services (visible in the connections widget), to track your app's external dependencies and monitor the health of those connections. Custom nodes Add custom nodes via the app/service list panel to include apps and services not automatically instrumented by New Relic (for example, load balancers, implementation planning, and so on). Group nodes A group node contains multiple other nodes. For apps, group nodes include a summarized health status indicator for all nodes in the group. Node arrangement and grouping Click and drag a node to move it around the map, for a customizable view of your architecture. App nodes can also be grouped together into a single node to better organize related apps and services. Grouped nodes include summarized health status indicator for all nodes in the group. To remove items from a group, mouse over the group and select the pencil pencil icon, then select the minus minus-circle icon to remove the item from the group. Incoming and outgoing connections Service maps automatically detects incoming and outgoing connections based on HTTP calls between entities. Mouse over a node to highlight the node's connections. Widgets at the end of each node display a count of that node's connections, and you can click on those widgets to add related entities to the map: View performance summary Click on an app to view its performance over the last 30 minutes. The chart defaults to Response time, but you can view other metrics by selecting any of the available Apdex, Throughput, or Error rate links. While charts use the last 30 minutes of performance data, the service map as a whole is based on the last five minutes. View the app in APM or browser and view its labels by selecting the overflow ellipsis-v icon. Click the app name again to hide the summary charts, and select the overflow ellipsis-h icon again to hide other details. Map list and app/service list panels Select the Map list panel to: Search for and view your maps, and access other users' shared maps. Create a new map. Select the App/Service List panel to: Add new apps, mobile apps, and plugins to your map. Create custom nodes and add them to the map. Health status and performance metrics You can see health status indicators for most nodes. Except for out-of-process services (external services or background services), entities use the health status indicators used by New Relic Alerts. For out-of-process (external) services, the health status indicator measures the health of the connection to the external service. View all connected apps and services The Discover your environment feature allows you to view all of your apps, services, and dependencies together with a single click. This feature detects all connected applications and services (including externals and databases) to give you a comprehensive view of your overall software architecture environment. To view all connected apps and services: In APM, select Service maps. From your Map list, select Discover your environment to display all of your nodes. Hover over any node to view its dependencies and how it connects to other parts of your service map. Click on individual nodes to zoom in and view their details. The Discover your environment feature may not be available if you are using an older New Relic agent version. See Troubleshooting cross application tracing for version information. This feature may also not be available for highly complex service maps with many elements. Go to one.newrelic.com > More > Service maps > Map list > Discover your environment: Use this option to view all of your nodes and their dependencies in one place. Traffic light mode Traffic light mode lets you view the health status of your entire architecture at a glance. This feature helps you quickly find service and app problems, even within a complex environment with many nodes. To toggle this mode, select the Views tab, then select Traffic light mode. When traffic lights mode is On, zooming out far enough on a service map eventually causes the nodes to switch from displaying textual information, to only health status colors. Click on individual nodes to zoom in and view more details. Traffic light mode is on by default. When traffic lights mode is Off, service map nodes retain their textual information and do not switch to health status colors, No matter how far you zoom out. one.newrelic.com > More > Service maps > Views > Traffic light mode: When traffic light mode is enabled, zooming out of your service map displays nodes in health status colors. Midnight mode Midnight mode inverts the screen's colors, going from a white background to a dark background. Midnight mode reduces eye strain, especially in low light environments. To toggle this mode, select the Views tab, then select Midnight mode.",

      "body": "You can edit configuration settings for the Go agent to control some aspects of how New Relic monitors your app; for example: Turn high-security mode on. Add custom tags for filtering and sorting in the UI. Turn off the collection of errors, transaction events, transaction traces, and custom events. Configuration methods and precedence The primary way to configure the Go agent is by modifying the newrelic.Config struct as part of calling newrelic.NewApplication(), which is part of the standard installation process. With Go agent versions 2.7.0 or higher, you can also set a limited number of configuration options using server-side configuration in the UI. The Go agent follows this order of precedence for configuration. If enabled, server-side configuration overrides all corresponding values in the newrelic.Config struct, even if the server-side values are left blank. If server-side configuration is enabled with the Go agent, it overrides all corresponding values in the newrelic.Config struct, even if the server-side values are left blank. Here are detailed descriptions of each configuration method: Server-side configuration (2.7.0 or higher) Server-side configuration is available with Go agent versions 2.7.0 or higher. This allows you to configure certain settings in the UI. This applies your changes automatically to all agents even if they run across multiple hosts. Where available, this document includes the UI labels for server-side config under individual config options as the Server-side label. You must still call newrelic.NewApplication() in your application process following the steps described in the in-process configuration. Configuration options set server-side will overwrite those set locally. Since not all configuration options are available server side, you may want to still update your newrelic.Config struct. Caution If server-side config is enabled, the agent ignores any value in the newrelic.Config struct that could be set in the UI. Even if the UI value is empty, the agent treats this as an empty value and does not use the newrelic.Config value. In process newrelic.Config struct You configure your Go agent from the local in process newrelic.Config struct. This struct can be accessed when calling newrelic.NewApplication(). Add the following in the main function or in an init block: app, err := newrelic.NewApplication( newrelic.ConfigAppName(\"Your Application Name\"), newrelic.ConfigLicense(\"__YOUR_NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY__\"), ) Copy Update values on the newrelic.Config struct to configure your application using newrelic.ConfigOptions. These are functions that accept a pointer to the newrelic.Config struct. Add additional newrelic.ConfigOptions to further configure your application. For example, you can use one of the predefined options to do common configurations: app, err := newrelic.NewApplication( newrelic.ConfigAppName(\"Your Application Name\"), newrelic.ConfigLicense(\"__YOUR_NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY__\"), // add debug level logging to stdout newrelic.ConfigDebugLogger(os.Stdout), ) Copy Or, you can create your own newrelic.ConfigOption to do more complex configurations: app, err := newrelic.NewApplication( newrelic.ConfigAppName(\"Your Application Name\"), newrelic.ConfigLicense(\"__YOUR_NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY__\"), newrelic.ConfigDebugLogger(os.Stdout), func(config *newrelic.Config) { // add more specific configuration of the agent within a custom ConfigOption config.HighSecurity = true config.CrossApplicationTracer.Enabled = false }, ) Copy Change configuration settings To make Go agent configuration changes, set the values in the newrelic.Config struct from within a custom newrelic.ConfigOption. For example, to turn New Relic monitoring off temporarily for testing purposes, change the Enabled value to false: app, err := newrelic.NewApplication( newrelic.ConfigAppName(\"Your Application Name\"), newrelic.ConfigLicense(\"__YOUR_NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY__\"), func(config *newrelic.Config) { config.Enabled = false }, ) Copy In this and the following examples, config represents your New Relic config struct, although you may have given it a different variable name when you installed the Go agent and initiated the configuration in your app. General configuration settings License (REQUIRED) Type String Default (none) Set in newrelic.Config struct Specifies your New Relic license key, used to associate your app's metrics with a New Relic account. The license and the app name are both set as part of the New Relic installation process. AppName (REQUIRED) Type String Default (none) Set in newrelic.Config struct This is the application name used to aggregate data in the New Relic UI. You set both the license and the app name as part of the New Relic installation process. To report data to multiple apps at the same time, specify a list of names separated with a semicolon. Do not put a space before the semicolon itself. For example: app, err := newrelic.NewApplication( newrelic.ConfigAppName(\"YOUR_APP_NAME;APP_GROUP_1;ALL_APPS\"), newrelic.ConfigLicense(\"__YOUR_NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY__\"), ) Copy Enabled Type Boolean Default true Set in newrelic.Config struct When true, the agent sends data from your app to the New Relic collector. To turn off New Relic monitoring, set this to false. For example: app, err := newrelic.NewApplication( newrelic.ConfigAppName(\"Your Application Name\"), newrelic.ConfigLicense(\"__YOUR_NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY__\"), func(config *newrelic.Config) { config.Enabled = false }, ) Copy This can be useful for installing New Relic in a development environment or for troubleshooting purposes. When Enabled is set to false: The New Relic Go agent will not communicate with the New Relic collector. The agent will not spawn goroutines. The license key is not required during installation. Labels Type map [ string]string Default (none) Set in newrelic.Config struct Add tags. Creating four tag pairs Here's an example of setting four tags: app, err := newrelic.NewApplication( newrelic.ConfigAppName(\"Your Application Name\"), newrelic.ConfigLicense(\"__YOUR_NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY__\"), func(config *newrelic.Config) { config.Labels = map[string]string{ \"Env\": \"Dev\", \"Label2\": \"label2\", \"Label3\": \"label3\", \"Label4\": \"label4\", } }, ) Copy Logger Type Interface Default (none) Set in newrelic.Config struct You can use the Logger interface to write Go log files to a specific location or logging system. HighSecurity Type Boolean Default false Set in newrelic.Config struct Important This feature requires Enterprise tier. High security mode enforces certain security settings and prevents them from being overridden, so that the agent sends no sensitive data. High security mode does the following: Turns SSL on Turns off reporting of error message strings Turns off reporting of custom events This setting must match the corresponding account setting in the UI. For example: app, err := newrelic.NewApplication( newrelic.ConfigAppName(\"Your Application Name\"), newrelic.ConfigLicense(\"__YOUR_NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY__\"), func(config *newrelic.Config) { config.HighSecurity = true }, ) Copy The agent communicates with New Relic via HTTPS by default, and New Relic requires HTTPS for all traffic to APM and our REST API. UseTLS (DEPRECATED) Type Boolean Default true Set in newrelic.Config struct Important This option was removed in agent version 2.0. Controls whether HTTPS or HTTP is used to send data to New Relic. The agent communicates with New Relic via HTTPS by default (which uses TLS protocol), and New Relic requires HTTPS for all traffic to APM and the New Relic REST API. HostDisplayName Type String Default (none) Set in newrelic.Config struct This sets the hostname displayed in the APM UI. This is an optional configuration. Transport Type http.RoundTripper Default (none) Set in newrelic.Config struct This customizes http.Client communication with New Relic collectors. This can be used to configure a proxy. RuntimeSampler.Enabled Type Boolean Default true Set in newrelic.Config struct When true, the agent captures runtime statistics. Custom events configuration You can create custom events and make them available for querying and analysis. CustomInsightsEvents.Enabled Type Boolean Default true Set in newrelic.Config struct When true, the agent sends custom events to New Relic. This setting is overridden by HighSecurity, which disables custom events. To disable custom events, place the following in your Go app after the New Relic config is initiated: app, err := newrelic.NewApplication( newrelic.ConfigAppName(\"Your Application Name\"), newrelic.ConfigLicense(\"__YOUR_NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY__\"), func(config *newrelic.Config) { config.CustomInsightsEvents.Enabled = false }, ) Copy Transaction events configuration Transaction events are used in collecting events corresponding to web requests and background tasks. Event data allows the New Relic UI to show additional information such as histograms and percentiles. TransactionEvents.Enabled Type Boolean Default true Set in newrelic.Config struct When true, the agent collects transaction events. TransactionEvents.Attributes Type Struct Default Enabled, no exclusions Set in newrelic.Config struct TransactionEvents.Attributes is a struct with three fields: Enabled bool Include []string Exclude []string Copy Use TransactionEvents.Attributes.Enabled to turn attribute collection on or off for transaction events. Use Include and Exclude to include or exclude specific attributes. An example of excluding an attribute slice named allAgentAttributeNames from transaction events: app, err := newrelic.NewApplication( newrelic.ConfigAppName(\"Your Application Name\"), newrelic.ConfigLicense(\"__YOUR_NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY__\"), func(config *newrelic.Config) { config.TransactionEvents.Attributes.Exclude = allAgentAttributeNames }, ) Copy TransactionEvents.MaxSamplesStored Type Integer Default 10000 Set in newrelic.Config struct Defines the maximum number of transaction events per minute to be sent to New Relic, up to the default maximum of 10,000 transaction events. Error collector configuration The following settings are used to configure the error collector: Tip For an overview of error configuration in New Relic, see Manage errors in APM. ErrorCollector.Enabled Type Boolean Default true Set in newrelic.Config struct, Server-side config Server-side label Error Collection on/off When false, the agent collects no errors or error traces. ErrorCollector.CaptureEvents Type Boolean Default true Set in newrelic.Config struct When true, the agent collects error analytic events. ErrorCollector.IgnoreStatusCodes Type Integer Default Error codes 399 and below, and 404, are ignored. Set in newrelic.Config struct, Server-side config Server-side label Error Collection: Ignore from error collection This controls which HTTP response codes are ignored as errors. Response codes that are greater than or equal to 100 and strictly less than 400 are ignored by default and never have to be specified when calling this function. Response codes 0, 5, and 404 are included on the list by default, but must be specified when adding to the ignore list. This function's default form is: config.ErrorCollector.IgnoreStatusCodes = []int{ 0, // gRPC OK 5, // gRPC NOT_FOUND http.StatusNotFound, // 404 } Copy You can also add response codes as HTTPs, as http.StatusNotFound above. Important If used, server-side configuration will override any values set on the newrelic.Config struct. Therefore to ignore 404 when server-side configuration is enabled, you must include 404 in the configuration set in the UI. Example of ignoring error code To add HTTP response code 418 to the default ignore list, which includes 0, 5, and 404: app, err := newrelic.NewApplication( newrelic.ConfigAppName(\"Your Application Name\"), newrelic.ConfigLicense(\"__YOUR_NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY__\"), func(config *newrelic.Config) { config.ErrorCollector.IgnoreStatusCodes = []int{0, 5, 404, 418} }, ) Copy ErrorCollector.Attributes Type Struct Default Enabled, no exclusions Set in newrelic.Config struct ErrorCollector.Attributes is a struct with three fields: Enabled bool Include []string Exclude []string Copy Use ErrorCollector.Attributes.Enabled to turn attribute collection on or off for errors. Use Include and Exclude to include or exclude specific attributes. An example of excluding an attribute slice named allAgentAttributeNames from errors: app, err := newrelic.NewApplication( newrelic.ConfigAppName(\"Your Application Name\"), newrelic.ConfigLicense(\"__YOUR_NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY__\"), func(config *newrelic.Config) { config.ErrorCollector.Attributes.Exclude = allAgentAttributeNames }, ) Copy Transaction tracer configuration Here are settings for changing transaction tracer configuration. For more information about transaction traces, see Transaction traces. TransactionTracer.Enabled Type Boolean Default true Set in newrelic.Config struct, Server-side config Server-side label Transaction Tracing on/off When true, the agent collects transaction traces (detailed information about slow transactions). TransactionTracer.Threshold.IsApdexFailing Type Boolean Default true Set in newrelic.Config struct, Server-side config Server-side label Transaction Tracing: Threshold Controls whether the transaction trace threshold is based on Apdex. If true, then the trace threshold is four times the Apdex threshold. If false, the agent uses Threshold.Duration as the transaction trace threshold. TransactionTracer.Threshold.Duration Type time.Millisecond Default 500 Set in newrelic.Config struct, Server-side config Server-side label Transaction Tracing: Threshold If Threshold.IsApdexFailing is set to false, the agent uses this duration as the transaction trace threshold. TransactionTracer.Segments.Threshold Type time.Millisecond Default 2 Set in newrelic.Config struct This is the threshold at which segments will be added to the trace. TransactionTracer.Segments.Attributes Important Available for Go agent version 2.6.0 or higher. Type Struct Default Enabled, no exclusions Set in newrelic.Config struct TransactionTracer.Segments.Attributes is a struct with three fields: Enabled bool Include []string Exclude []string Copy Use TransactionTracer.Segments.Attributes.Enabled to turn attribute collection on or off for transaction trace segments. Use Include and Exclude to include or exclude specific attributes. An example of excluding an attribute slice named allSegmentAttributeNames from traces: app, err := newrelic.NewApplication( newrelic.ConfigAppName(\"Your Application Name\"), newrelic.ConfigLicense(\"__YOUR_NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY__\"), func(config *newrelic.Config) { config.TransactionTracer.Segments.Attributes.Exclude = allSegmentAttributeNames }, ) Copy TransactionTracer.Segments.StackTraceThreshold Type time.Millisecond Default 500 Set in newrelic.Config struct, Server-side config Server-side label Transaction Tracing: Stack trace threshold This is the threshold at which segments will be given a stack trace in the transaction trace. Caution Lowering this setting may drastically increase agent overhead. TransactionTracer.Attributes Type Struct Default Enabled, no exclusions Set in newrelic.Config struct TransactionTracer.Attributes is a struct with three fields: Enabled bool Include []string Exclude []string Copy Use TransactionTracer.Attributes.Enabled to turn attribute collection on or off for transaction traces. Use Include and Exclude to include or exclude specific attributes. An example of excluding an attribute slice named allAgentAttributeNames from traces: app, err := newrelic.NewApplication( newrelic.ConfigAppName(\"Your Application Name\"), newrelic.ConfigLicense(\"__YOUR_NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY__\"), func(config *newrelic.Config) { config.TransactionTracer.Attributes.Exclude = allAgentAttributeNames }, ) Copy Datastore tracer configuration Here are datastore settings, including slow query enabling and settings. DatastoreTracer.InstanceReporting.Enabled Type Boolean Default true Set in newrelic.Config struct This enables collection of datastore instance metrics (such as the host and port) for some database drivers. These are reported on transaction traces and as part of slow query data. DatastoreTracer.NameReporting.Enabled Type Boolean Default true Set in newrelic.Config struct Use this to enable collection of the database name on slow query traces and transaction traces. The default value of attribute enabled is true. DatastoreTracer.QueryParameters.Enabled Type Boolean Default true Set in newrelic.Config struct When true, the agent collects datastore call query parameters. DatastoreTracer.SlowQuery.Enabled Type Boolean Default true Set in newrelic.Config struct Controls whether slow queries are captured. DatastoreTracer.SlowQuery.Threshold Type time.Millisecond Default 10 Set in newrelic.Config struct The agent captures slow query data for queries slower than this. Cross application tracing configuration Here are settings for changing the cross application tracing feature. CrossApplicationTracer.Enabled Type Boolean Default true Set in newrelic.Config struct, Server-side config Server-side label Cross-application tracing on/off When true, the agent will add cross application tracing headers in outbound requests, and scan incoming requests for cross application tracing headers. Distributed tracing and cross application tracing cannot be used simultaneously. The default configuration for the Go agent disables distributed tracing and enables cross application tracing. Distributed tracing configuration Important Enabling distributed tracing requires Go agent version 2.1.0 or higher, and it disables cross application tracing. It also has effects on other features. Before enabling, read the transition guide. Distributed tracing lets you see the path that a request takes as it travels through a distributed system. When distributed tracing is enabled, you can collect span events. DistributedTracer.Enabled Type Boolean Default false Set in newrelic.Config struct When true, the agent will add distributed tracing headers in outbound requests, and scan incoming requests for distributed tracing headers. Enabling distributed tracing disables cross application tracing. DistributedTracer.ExcludeNewRelicHeader Type Boolean Default false Set in newrelic.Config struct Set this to true to exclude the New Relic header that is attached to outbound requests, and instead only rely on W3C Trace Context Headers for distributed tracing. If this is false then both types of headers are used. Span events configuration Span events are reported for distributed tracing. Distributed tracing must be enabled to report span events. These settings control the collection of span events: SpanEvents.Enabled Type Boolean Default true Set in newrelic.Config struct When true, the agent will collect span events. SpanEvents.Attributes Important Available for Go agent version 2.6.0 or higher. Type Struct Default Enabled, no exclusions Set in newrelic.Config struct SpanEvents.Attributes is a struct with three fields: Enabled bool Include []string Exclude []string Copy Use SpanEvents.Attributes.Enabled to enable or disable attribute collection for span events. Use Include and Exclude to include or exclude specific attributes. An example of excluding an attribute slice named allSpanAttributeNames from traces: app, err := newrelic.NewApplication( newrelic.ConfigAppName(\"Your Application Name\"), newrelic.ConfigLicense(\"__YOUR_NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY__\"), func(config *newrelic.Config) { config.TransactionTracer.Segments.Attributes.Exclude = allSpanAttributeNames }, ) Copy Infinite Tracing configuration To enable Infinite Tracing, enable distributed tracing (set config.DistributedTracer.Enabled = true on the newrelic.Config struct) and add the additional settings below. For an example, see Language agents: Configure distributed tracing.

      "body": "This document contains the configuration options for the APM .NET agent. Important As of September 2021, a small subset of APIs, configuration options, and installation options for .NET will be replaced by new methods. For more details, including how you can easily prepare for this transition, see our Explorers Hub post. Configuration overview APM agent configuration options allow you to control some aspects of how the agent behaves. Some of these config options are part of the basic install process (like setting your license key and app name), but most are more advanced settings, such as: setting a log level, setting up proxy host access, excluding certain attributes, and enabling distributed tracing. The .NET agent gets its configuration from the newrelic.config file, which is generated as part of the install process. By default, only a global newrelic.config file is created, but you can also create app-local newrelic.config files for finer control over a multi-app system. Other ways to set config options include: using environment variables, or setting server-side configuration from the UI. For more on the various config options and what overrides what, see Config settings precedence. Support for both .NET Framework and .NET Core use the same configuration options and have the same APM features, unless otherwise stated. If you make changes to the config file and want to validate that it's in the right format, you can check it against the XSD file (for example, at C:\\ProgramData\\New Relic\\.NET Agent\\newrelic.xsd for Windows) with any XSD validator. Important For IIS: after you change your newrelic.config or app.config file, perform an IISRESET from an administrative command prompt. Log level adjustments do not require a reset. Configuration methods and precedence levels Upon installation, the .NET agent's configuration file (newrelic.config) applies to all monitored applications, but you can configure the agent in other ways. Here's a diagram showing how different configuration options take precedence over one another: This diagram explains the order of precedence for different ways you might configure the .NET agent. Here are details about the configuration methods shown in the diagram, and their precedence levels: .NET configuration Details and precedence web.config or app.config or appsettings.json Configuration settings set in these files take highest precedence. However, if the agent is disabled in the local or global newrelic.config, the NewRelic.AgentEnabled settings in these files will be ignored. Environment variables Second-highest precedence. For more about these, see .NET environment variables. Server-side configuration Third-highest precedence. A limited number of server-side configuration settings are available; the other settings will come from other configuration sources. App-local newrelic.config Fourth-highest precedence. You can create app-local newrelic.config files to configure individual apps on a multi-app system. These local configuration files override settings in the global newrelic.config file. The agent looks for app-local config files in the following directories, in this order: A directory specified in your web.config or app.config file with the NewRelic.ConfigFile property The web app's root directory (with the app.config or web.config) The directory containing your app's executable file Note that the app-local config file must be complete and validate against the XSD file (for example, at C:\\ProgramData\\New Relic\\.NET Agent\\newrelic.xsd for Windows). Default (global) newrelic.config Default source and the lowest precedence. Will configure all applications on a host in the absence of other config files. The global config file is located in the New Relic agent home directory: %PROGRAMDATA%\\New Relic\\.NET Agent Required environment variables New Relic's .NET agent relies on environment variables to tell the .NET Common Language Runtime (CLR) to attach New Relic to your processes. Some .NET agent install procedures (like the MSI installer) will automatically set these variables for you; some procedures will require you to manually set them. Caution Security recommendation: You should consider what users can set system environment variables. You should also secure the accounts under which your applications execute to prevent user environment variables overriding system environment variables .NET Framework environment variables For .NET Framework, the following variables are required: COR_ENABLE_PROFILING=1 COR_PROFILER={71DA0A04-7777-4EC6-9643-7D28B46A8A41} NEWRELIC_INSTALL_PATH=path\\to\\agent\\directory Copy The .NET agent installer will add these to IIS or as system-wide environment variables. .NET Core environment variables For .NET Core, the following variables are required: Linux: CORECLR_ENABLE_PROFILING=1 CORECLR_PROFILER={36032161-FFC0-4B61-B559-F6C5D41BAE5A} CORECLR_NEWRELIC_HOME=path/to/agent/directory CORECLR_PROFILER_PATH=\"${CORECLR_NEWRELIC_HOME}/libNewRelicProfiler.so\" Copy Windows: CORECLR_ENABLE_PROFILING=1 CORECLR_PROFILER={36032161-FFC0-4B61-B559-F6C5D41BAE5A} NEWRELIC_INSTALL_PATH=path\\to\\agent\\directory CORECLR_NEWRELIC_HOME=path\\to\\agent\\directory Copy The .NET agent installer will add these to IIS or as system-wide environment variables. If your system has previously used monitoring services (non-New Relic), you may have a \"profiler conflict\" when trying to install and use the New Relic agent. More details: Profiler conflict explanation New Relic’s .NET agents rely on environment variables to tell the .NET Common Language Runtime (CLR) to load New Relic into your processes. The install-related environment variables are Microsoft variables, not New Relic variables. They can be used by other .NET profilers, and only one profiler can be attached to a process at a time. For this reason, if you have used previous application monitoring products, you may have profiler conflicts. For specific install instructions, see the .NET agent install documentation. Optional environment variables Some configuration options in New Relic's .NET agent can be set via environment variables as an alternative to setting them in a config file. Below is a list of environment variables recognized by the .NET agent with example values. NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY=XXXXXXXX NEW_RELIC_LOG=MyApp.log NEW_RELIC_APP_NAME=Descriptive Name MAX_TRANSACTION_SAMPLES_STORED=500 MAX_EVENT_SAMPLES_STORED=500 NEW_RELIC_DISTRIBUTED_TRACING_ENABLED=true NEW_RELIC_SPAN_EVENTS_ENABLED=false NEW_RELIC_LABELS=foo:bar;zip:zap NEW_RELIC_CONFIG_OBSCURING_KEY=XXXXXXXX NEW_RELIC_DISABLE_SAMPLERS=true NEWRELIC_PROFILER_LOG_DIRECTORY=path\\to\\agent\\directory (not configurable via config file) Copy Setup options, newrelic.config Use these options to setup and configure your agent via the newrelic.config file. The New Relic .NET agent supports the following categories of setup options: Configuration element Service element Obscuring key element Proxy element Log element Application element (configuration) Data transmission element Host name Configuration element The root element of the configuration document is a configuration element. <configuration xmlns=\"urn:newrelic-config\" agentEnabled=\"true\" maxStackTraceLines=\"50\" timingPrecision=\"low\"> Copy The configuration element supports the following attributes: agentEnabled Type Boolean Default true Enable or disable the New Relic agent. maxStackTraceLines Type Integer Default 80 The maximum number of stack frames to trace in any stack dump. timingPrecision Type String Default low Controls the precision of the timers. High precision will provide better data, but at a lower execution speed. Possible values are high and low. Service element The first child of the configuration element is a service element. The service element configures the agent's connection to the New Relic service. <service licenseKey=\"YOUR_LICENSE_KEY\" sendEnvironmentInfo=\"true\" syncStartup=\"false\" sendDataOnExit=\"false\" sendDataOnExitThreshold=\"60000\" autoStart=\"true\"/> Copy The service element supports the following attributes: licenseKey (required) Type String Default (none) Your New Relic license key. New Relic uses the license key to match your app's data to the correct account in the UI. Set the license key via environment variable. Alternatively, set the NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY environment variable in the application's environment. NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY=XXXXXXXX Copy sendEnvironmentInfo Type Boolean Default true Instructs the agent to record execution environment information. Environment information includes operating system, agent version, and which assemblies are available. syncStartup Type Boolean Default false Block application startup until the agent connects to New Relic. If set to true, the first transaction may take substantially longer to complete, because it is blocked until the connection to New Relic is finished. sendDataOnExit Type Boolean Default false Block application shutdown until the agent sends all data from the latest harvest cycle. sendDataOnExitThreshold Type Integer Default 60000 Unit Milliseconds The minimum amount of time the process must run before the agent blocks it from shutting down. This setting only applies when sendDataOnExit is true. completeTransactionsOnThread Type Boolean Default false If false, the agent uses a pool thread to complete the transaction processing. If true, the agent will complete transaction processing on the request thread. requestTimeout Type Integer Default 2000 (sendDataOnExit enabled) 120000 (sendDataOnExit disabled) Unit Milliseconds The agent's request timeout when communicating with New Relic. autoStart Type Boolean Default True Automatically start the .NET agent when the first instrumented method is hit. ssl (DEPRECATED) Type Boolean Default true The option to disable SSL is valid only for .NET agent versions 7.x and earlier. .NET agent version 8.x and higher communicate only via SSL. The agent communicates with New Relic via HTTPS by default, and New Relic requires HTTPS for all traffic to APM and the New Relic REST API. Obscuring key element The obscuringKey element is an optional child of the service element. The .NET Agent uses this value to deobfuscate supported configuration values. For example, when an obfuscated proxy password is supplied, it will be deobfuscated using this key. <service licenseKey=\"YOUR_LICENSE_KEY\"> <obscuringKey>OBSCURING_KEY</obscuringKey> </service> Copy The obscuring key may also be configured by setting the NEW_RELIC_CONFIG_OBSCURING_KEY environment variable. Caution Security recommendation: The placement of the obscuring Key in the same configuration file as an obfuscated value may pose a security risk. Consider placing the obscuring key in an environment variable and limiting access to environment variables within your environment. Proxy element The proxy element is an optional child of the service element. The proxy element is used when the agent communicates to the New Relic back-end service via a proxy. <service licenseKey=\"YOUR_LICENSE_KEY\"> <proxy host=\"hostname\" port=\"PROXY_PORT\" uriPath=\"path/to/something.aspx\" domain=\"mydomain.com\" user=\"PROXY_USERNAME\" password=\"PROXY_PASSWORD\" passwordObfuscated=\"OBFUSCATED_PROXY_PASSWORD\"/> </service> Copy The proxy element supports the following attributes: host Type String Default (none) Defines the proxy host. port Type Integer Default 8080 Defines the proxy port. uriPath Type String Default (none) Optionally define a proxy URI path. domain Type String Default (none) Optionally define a domain to use when authenticating with the proxy server. user Type String Default (none) Optionally define a user name for authentication. password Type String Default (none) Optionally define a password for authentication. passwordObfuscated Type String Default (none) For additional security, the .NET Agent supports the use of an obfuscated proxy password with the passwordObfuscated attribute. The obfuscated proxy password is generated using the following New Relic CLI command: newrelic agent config obfuscate --key OBSCURING_KEY --value \"CLEAR_TEXT_PROXY_PASSWORD\" Copy Important When using an obfuscated proxy password, the obscuring key must also be configured. Log element The log element is a child of the configuration element. The log element configures New Relic's logging . The agent generates its own log file to keep its logging information separate from your application's logs. <log level=\"info\" auditLog=\"false\" console=\"false\" directory=\"PATH\\TO\\LOG\\DIRECTORY\" fileName=\"FILENAME.log\" /> Copy The log element supports the following attributes: level Type String Default info Defines the level of detail recorded in the log file. Possible values, in increasing order of detail, are: off error warn info debug finest all Important Increasing the log level will increase New Relic's performance impact. auditLog Type Boolean Default false Records all data sent to and received from New Relic in both an auditlog log file and the standard log file. console Type Boolean Default false Send log messages to the console, in addition to the log file. directory Type String Default C:\\ProgramData\\New Relic\\.NET Agent\\Logs The directory to hold log files generated by the agent. If this is omitted, then a directory named logs in the New Relic agent install area will be used by default. fileName Type String Default (none) Defines a name for the log file. If you do not define a fileName, the name is derived from the name of the monitored process. Alternatively, set the NEW_RELIC_LOG environment variable in the application's environment. NEW_RELIC_LOG=MyApp.log Copy Application element (required) The application element is a child of the configuration element. This required element defines your application name, and disables or enables sampling. name Type String Default My Application The name of your .NET application is a child of the application element. New Relic will aggregate your data according to this name. For example, if you have two running applications named AppA and AppB, you will see two applications in the New Relic interface: AppA and AppB. You can also assign up to three names to your app. The first name is the primary name. For example: <application> <name>MY APPLICATION PRIMARY</name> <name>SECOND APP NAME</name> <name>THIRD APP NAME</name> </application> Copy Alternatively, set the NEW_RELIC_APP_NAME environment variable in the application's environment. NEW_RELIC_APP_NAME=Descriptive Name Copy disableSamplers Type Boolean Default false Samplers collect information about memory and CPU consumption. Set this to true to disable sampling. Alternatively, set the NEW_RELIC_DISABLE_SAMPLERS environment variable in the application's environment. NEW_RELIC_DISABLE_SAMPLERS=true Copy Data transmission element The dataTransmission element is a child of the configuration element. This element affects how data is sent to New Relic and can be used if you have specific data transmission requirements. <dataTransmission putForDataSend=\"false\" compressedContentEncoding=\"deflate\"/> Copy The dataTransmission element supports the following attributes: putForDataSend Type Boolean Default false Defines the HTTP method used when sending data to New Relic. Set this to true to enable using the PUT method when sending data. The POST method is used by default. Host name If the default host name label in the APM UI is not useful, you can decorate that name in the New Relic UI with a display name. After the application process is restarted and the .NET agent is reporting again, the display name will appear in the Servers drop-down list. This host name setting does not affect the list of hosts on your application's Summary page. To set a display name, choose one of the following options. The environment variable takes precedence over the config file value. Then restart your application to see your changes in the New Relic UI. Set using config file Set the displayName attribute in the processHost element in newrelic.config. The processHost element is a child of the configuration element. <configuration . . . > <processHost displayName=\"CUSTOM_NAME\" /> </configuration> Copy Set using environment variable Set the NEW_RELIC_PROCESS_HOST_DISPLAY_NAME environment variable: NEW_RELIC_PROCESS_HOST_DISPLAY_NAME = \"CUSTOM_NAME\" Copy Cloud platform utilization Configures the utilization configuration element to control how the agent collects utilization information and sends it to the New Relic service to determine pricing. The agent can collect information from Amazon Web Services (AWS) EC2 instances, Docker containers, Azure, Google Cloud Platform, Pivotal Cloud Foundry, and Kubernetes. detectAws Type Boolean Default true Determines whether the agent polls AWS metadata API. detectAzure Type Boolean Default true Determines whether the agent polls Azure metadata API. detectGcp Type Boolean Default true Determines whether the agent polls GCP metadata API. detectPcf Type Boolean Default true Determines whether the agent polls PCF information from environment variables. detectDocker Type Boolean Default true Determines whether the agent reads Docker information from the file system. detectKubernetes Type Boolean Default true Determines whether the agent polls Kubernetes information from environment variables. Instrumentation options Use these options to configure which elements of your application and environment to instrument. New Relic for .NET supports the following categories of instrumentation options: Instrumentation element Applications element (instrumentation) Attributes element Instrumentation element The instrumentation element is a child of the configuration element. By default, the .NET agent instruments IIS asp worker processes and Azure web and worker roles. To instrument other processes, see Instrumenting custom applications. Applications element (instrumentation) The applications element is a child of the instrumentation element. The applications element specifies which non-web apps to instrument. It contains a name attribute. Important This is not the same as the application (configuration) element, which is a child of the configuration element. <instrumentation> <applications> <application name=\"MyService1.exe\" /> <application name=\"MyService2.exe\" /> <application name=\"MyService3.exe\" /> </applications> </instrumentation> Copy Attributes element An attribute is a key/value pair that determines the properties of an event or transaction. Each attribute is sent to APM transaction traces, APM error traces, Transaction events, TransactionError events, or PageView events. The primary attributes element enables or disables attribute collection for the .NET agent, and defines specific attributes to collect or exclude. You can also configure attribute settings based on their destination: Error collection, transaction traces, browser instrumentation, and transaction events. In this example, the agent excludes all attributes whose key begins with myApiKey (myApiKey.bar, myApiKey.value), but collects the custom attribute myApiKey.foo. <attributes enabled=\"true\"> <exclude>myApiKey.*</exclude> <include>myApiKey.foo</include> </attributes> Copy You can view the .NET APM attributes on the .NET agent attributes page. You can also define custom attributes with the agent API call AddCustomParameter. enabled Type Boolean Default true Enable or disable attribute collection. When set to false in the primary attribute element, this setting overrides all attribute settings for individual destinations. include Type String Default (none) If attributes are enabled, the agent will collect all attribute keys specified in this list. To specify multiple attribute keys, specify each individually. You can also use a * wildcard character at the end of a key to match multiple attributes (for example, myApiKey.*). For more information, see Attribute rules. exclude Type String Default (none) If attributes are enabled, the agent will not collect attribute keys specified in this list. To specify multiple attribute keys, specify each individually. You can also use a * wildcard character at the end of a key to match multiple attributes (for example, myApiKey.*). For more information, see Attribute rules. Feature options Use these options to enable, disable, and configure New Relic features. New Relic for .NET allows you to configure the following features: App pools Cross application traces Error collection High security mode Strip exception messages Transaction events Custom events Custom parameters Tags/labels Browser instrumentation Slow Queries Transaction traces Datastore tracer Distributed tracing Span events Capture HTTP Request Headers App pools Important This is only applicable to a system's global config file. The applicationPools element is a child of the configuration element. The applicationPools element specifies for the profiler exactly which application pools to instrument and uses the same name as the IIS application pool name. This configuration element is useful when you may need to instrument only a small subset of your app pools. For example, a given server might have several hundred application pools, but only a few of those pools need to be instrumented by the .NET agent. Here is an example of disabling instrumentation for specific application pools: <applicationPools> <applicationPool name=\"Foo\" instrument=\"false\"/> <applicationPool name=\"Bar\" instrument=\"false\"/> </applicationPools> Copy Here is an example of disabling instrumentation for all application pools currently executing on the server and enabling instrumentation for specific application pools: <applicationPools> <defaultBehavior instrument=\"false\"/> <applicationPool name=\"Foo\" instrument=\"true\"/> <applicationPool name=\"Bar\" instrument=\"true\"/> </applicationPools> Copy The applicationPools element supports the following elements: defaultBehavior Type Boolean Default false Defines how the .NET agent will behave on a \"global\" level for application pools served via IIS. The .NET agent instruments all application pools by default. When true, application pools listed under applicationPool with an instrument attribute set to false will not be instrumented. Essentially, when set to false, the application pool list acts as an allow list. When set to true, the application pool list acts as a deny list. applicationPool Defines instrumentation behavior for a specific application pool. The name attribute is the name of an application pool. Enable or disable profiling in the instrument attribute. Define this application in the name attribute. Cross application traces The crossApplicationTracer element is a child of the configuration element. crossApplicationTracer links transaction traces across applications. When linked in a service-oriented architecture, all instrumented applications that communicate with each other via HTTP will now \"link\" transaction traces with the applications that they call and the applications they are called by. Cross application tracing makes it easier to understand the performance relationship between services and applications. <crossApplicationTracer enabled=\"true\"/> Copy The crossApplicationTracer element supports the following attribute: enabled Type Boolean Default true Enable or disable cross application tracing Error collection The errorCollector element is a child of the configuration element. errorCollector configures error collection, which captures information about uncaught exceptions and sends them to New Relic. <errorCollector enabled=\"true\" captureEvents=\"true\" maxEventSamplesStored=\"100\"> <ignoreClasses> <errorClass>System.IO.FileNotFoundException</errorClass> <errorClass>System.Threading.ThreadAbortException</errorClass> </ignoreClasses> <ignoreMessages> <errorClass name=\"System.Exception\"> <message>Ignore message</message> <message>Ignore too</message> </errorClass> </ignoreMessages> <ignoreStatusCodes> <code>401</code> <code>404</code> </ignoreStatusCodes> <expectedClasses> <errorClass>System.ArgumentNullException</errorClass> <errorClass>System.ArgumentOutOfRangeException</errorClass> </expectedClasses> <expectedMessages> <errorClass name=\"System.Exception\"> <message>Expected message</message> <message>Expected too</message> </errorClass> </expectedMessages> <expectedStatusCodes>403,500-505</expectedStatusCodes> <attributes enabled=\"true\"> <exclude>myApiKey.*</exclude> <include>myApiKey.foo</include> </attributes> </errorCollector> Copy Tip For an overview of error configuration in APM, see Manage errors in APM. Important expectedClasses, expectedMessages, and expectedStatusCodes configuration settings require .NET agent version 8.31.0.0 or higher. The errorCollector element supports the following elements and attributes: enabled Type Boolean Default true Enable or disable the error collector. captureEvents Type Boolean Default true Enable or disable the capturing of error events. maxEventSamplesStored Type Integer Default 100 Reservoir limit for error events. ignoreClasses A list of fully qualified class names to be ignored. The maximum number of error class and message combinations that SHOULD be reported is 50. If more than 50 are listed, then only the first 50 SHOULD be used ignoreMessages An optional map of fully qualified class names to list of strings matching a substring of the message of an error. The maximum number of error class and message combinations that SHOULD be reported is 50. If more than 50 are listed, then only the first 50 SHOULD be used ignoreErrors (DEPRECATED) Type String Default (none) Lists specific exceptions to not report to New Relic. The full name of the exception should be used, such as System.IO.FileNotFoundException. ignoreStatusCodes Type String Default (none) Lists specific HTTP error codes to not report to New Relic. You can use standard integral HTTP error codes, such as just 401, or you may use Microsoft full status codes with decimal points, such as 401.4 or 403.18. The status codes should be equal to or greater than 400. expectedClasses A list of fully qualified class names to be marked as expected. The maximum number of error class and message combinations that SHOULD be reported is 50. If more than 50 are listed, then only the first 50 SHOULD be used expectedMessages An optional map of fully qualified class names to list of strings matching a substring of the message of an error. The maximum number of error class and message combinations that SHOULD be reported is 50. If more than 50 are listed, then only the first 50 SHOULD be used expectedStatusCodes A comma separated list of status codes. The list may include integer ranges, using a single dash (-) and will be inclusive of both the starting and ending integer in the range. attributes Use this sub-element to customize your agent attribute settings for error traces. This sub-element uses the same settings as the primary attributes element: enabled, include, and exclude. High security mode The highSecurity element is a child of the configuration element. To enable high security mode, set this property to true and enable the high security property in the New Relic user interface. Enabling high security turns SSL on; request parameters, custom parameters and HTTP request headers are not collected; strip exception messages is enabled; and queries can't be sent to New Relic in their raw form. enabled Type Boolean Default false Enable or disable high security mode. Example: <highSecurity enabled=\"true\"/> Copy Strip exception messages The stripExceptionMessages element is a child of the configuration element. To enable strip exception messages, set this property to true. By default, this is set to false, which means that the agent sends messages from all exceptions to the New Relic collector. If you enable high security mode, this is automatically changed to true, and the agent strips the messages from exceptions. enabled Type Boolean Default false Enable or disable strip exception messages. Example: <stripExceptionMessages enabled=\"true\"/> Copy Transaction events The transactionEvents element is a child of the configuration element. Use transactionEvents to configure transaction events. <transactionEvents enabled=\"true\" maximumSamplesStored=\"10000\"> <attributes enabled=\"true\"> <exclude>myApiKey.*</exclude> <include>myApiKey.foo</include> </attributes> </transactionEvents> Copy The transactionEvents element supports the following attributes: enabled Type Boolean Default true Enable or disable the event recorder. maximumSamplesStored Type Integer Default 10000 The maximum number of samples to store in memory at once. Alternatively, set the MAX_TRANSACTION_SAMPLES_STORED environment variable in the application's environment. MAX_TRANSACTION_SAMPLES_STORED=500 Copy attributes Use this sub-element to customize your agent attribute settings for transaction events. This sub-element uses the same settings as the primary attributes element: enabled, include, and exclude. Tip These attribute settings are specific to transaction events. Attribute settings can be applied globally to all event types to with this configuration setting. Caution When distributed tracing and/or Infinite Tracing are enabled, information from transaction events is applied to the root Span Event of the transaction. Consider applying any attribute settings for transaction events to span events and/or apply them as Global Attribute settings. Custom events The customEvents element is a child of the configuration element. Use customEvents to configure custom events. <customEvents enabled=\"true\" maximumSamplesStored=\"10000\"/> Copy The CustomEvents element supports the following attributes: enabled Type Boolean Default true Enable or disable the event recorder. maximumSamplesStored Type Integer Default 10000 The maximum number of samples to store in memory at once. Alternatively, set the MAX_EVENT_SAMPLES_STORED environment variable in the application's environment. MAX_EVENT_SAMPLES_STORED=500 Copy Custom parameters The customParameters element is a child of the configuration element. Use customParameters to configure custom parameters. <customParameters enabled=\"true\" /> Copy The CustomParameters element supports the following attributes: enabled Type Boolean Default true Enable or disable the capture of custom parameters. Labels (tags) The labels element is a child of the configuration element. This sets tag names and values. The list is a semicolon delimited list of colon-separated name and value pairs. You can also use with the NEW_RELIC_LABELS environment variable. Example: <labels>foo:bar;zip:zap</labels> Copy Browser instrumentation The browserMonitoring element is a child of the configuration element. browserMonitoring configures browser monitoring in your .NET application. Browser gives you insight your end users' performance experience. This is accomplished by measuring the time it takes for your users' browsers to download and render your webpages by injecting a small amount of JavaScript code into the header and footer of each page. // If you use both the Exclude and Attribute elements // the Exclude element must be listed first. <browserMonitoring autoInstrument=\"true\"> <requestPathsExcluded> <path regex=\"url-regex-1\"/> <path regex=\"url-regex-2\"/> ... <path regex=\"url-regex-n\"/> </requestPathsExcluded> <attributes enabled=\"true\"> <exclude>myApiKey.*</exclude> <include>myApiKey.foo</include> </attributes> </browserMonitoring> Copy The browserMonitoring element supports the following attributes: autoInstrument Type Boolean Default true By default the agent automatically injects the browser agent JavaScript. To turn off automatic injection, set this attribute to false. attributes Use this sub-element to customize your agent attribute settings for browser monitoring. This sub-element uses the same settings as the primary attributes element: enabled, include, and exclude. requestPathsExcluded Use this sub-element to prevent the browser agent from being injected in specific pages. The element is used as follows: <requestPathsExcluded> <path regex=\"url-regex-1\"/> <path regex=\"url-regex-2\"/> ... <path regex=\"url-regex-n\"/> </requestPathsExcluded> Copy The agent will not inject the browser agent into pages whose URL matches one of the specified regular expressions. The regular expression should follow Microsoft guidelines for the Regex class. It is a reference to the virtual directory of the path in your application and not the full URL of the path you wish to exclude. For example, to exclude the pages in https://www.mywebsite.com/mywebpages/ you would simply insert /mywebpages/ as the path regex value. The requestPathsExcluded element should be used in cases where it is impossible or undesirable to use the DisableBrowserMonitoring() call. To minimize a possible performance impact try to use as few regular expressions as possible and keep them as simple as possible. Slow queries The slowSql element is a child of the configuration element. slowSql configures capturing information about slow query executions, and captures and obfuscates explain plans for these queries. <slowSql enabled=\"true\"/> Copy The slowSql element supports the following attribute: enabled Type Boolean Default true Enable or disable slow query tracing. Transaction traces The transactionTracer element is a child of the configuration element. transactionTracer configures transaction traces. Included in the trace is the exact call sequence of the transactions, including any query statements issued. <transactionTracer enabled=\"true\" transactionThreshold=\"apdex_f\" recordSql=\"obfuscated\" explainEnabled=\"true\" explainThreshold=\"500\" maxSegments=\"3000\" maxExplainPlans=\"20\"> <attributes enabled=\"true\"> <exclude>myApiKey.*</exclude> <include>myApiKey.foo</include> </attributes> </transactionTracer> Copy The transactionTracer element supports the following attributes: enabled Type Boolean Default true Enable or disable transaction traces. transactionThreshold Type String Default apdex_f Defines the threshold for transaction traces. If a transaction takes longer than the threshold, it is eligible for being traced. See transaction trace basics for more about the rules governing traces. The default value is apdex_f, which sets the threshold to four times the application's apdex_t value. For more information about apdex_t, see Apdex. You can also set the threshold to be a specific time value in milliseconds. recordSql Type String Default obfuscated Select a query tracing policy. Options are off, which records nothing; obfuscated, which records an obfuscated version of the query; or raw, which records the query exactly as it is issued to the database. Caution Recording raw queries may capture sensitive information. explainEnabled Type Boolean Default false When true, the agent captures EXPLAIN statements for slow queries. explainThreshold Type Integer Default 500 Unit Milliseconds The agent collects slow query data for queries that exceed this threshold, along with any available explain plans, as part of transaction traces. maxSegments Type Integer Default 3000 The maximum number of segments to collect in a transaction trace. maxExplainPlans Type Integer Default 20 The maximum number of explain plans to collect during a harvest cycle. maxStackTrace Type Integer Default 0 By default maxStackTrace is set to 0, which disables stack traces as part of a transaction trace. If this value is set greater than 0, then stack traces will be captured for transaction traces. attributes Use this sub-element to customize your agent attribute settings for transaction traces. This sub-element uses the same settings as the primary attributes element: enabled, include, and exclude. Datastore tracer The datastoreTracer element is a child of the configuration element. <datastoreTracer> <instanceReporting enabled=\"true\" /> <databaseNameReporting enabled=\"true\" /> <queryParameters enabled=\"false\" /> </datastoreTracer> Copy The datastoreTracer element supports the following sub-elements: instanceReporting Use this sub-element to enable collection of datastore instance metrics (such as the host and port) for some database drivers. These are reported on slow query traces and transaction traces. The default value of attribute enabled is true. databaseNameReporting Use this sub-element to enable collection of the database name on slow query traces and transaction traces for some database drivers. The default value of attribute enabled is true. queryParameters Use this sub-element to enable collection of the SQL query parameters on slow query traces. The default value of attribute enabled is false. Caution Recording query parameters may capture sensitive information. The transactionTracer.recordSql configuration option must be set to raw or this option is ignored. Distributed tracing The distributedTracing element is a child of the configuration element. <distributedTracing enabled=\"false\" excludeNewrelicHeader=\"false\"/> Copy Distributed tracing lets you see the path that a request takes as it travels through a distributed system. Enabling distributed tracing disables cross application tracing, and has other effects on APM features. Before enabling, read the planning guide. Important Requires .NET agent version 8.6.45.0 or higher. The distributedTracing element supports the following attributes: To enable or disable, see Enable distributed tracing. enabled Type Boolean Default false Alternatively, enable distributed tracing via the NEW_RELIC_DISTRIBUTED_TRACING_ENABLED environment variable in the application's environment. NEW_RELIC_DISTRIBUTED_TRACING_ENABLED=true Copy excludeNewrelicHeader Type Boolean Default false By default, supported versions of the agent utilize both the newrelic header and W3C Trace Context headers for distributed tracing. The newrelic distributed tracing header allows interoperability with older agents that don't support W3C Trace Context headers. Agent versions that support W3C Trace Context headers will prioritize them over newrelic headers for distributed tracing. If you do not want to utilize the newrelic header, setting this to true will result in the agent excluding the newrelic header and only using W3C Trace Context headers for distributed tracing. Distributed tracing reports span events. Span event reporting is enabled by default, but distributed tracing must be enabled for spans to be reported. To disable span events, choose one of the following options: Disable span events via config file Set the <spanEvents> element to false to disable via the newrelic.config file. This element is a child of the <configuration> element. <configuration . . . > <spanEvents enabled=\"false\" /> </configuration> Copy Disable span events via environment variable Set the NEW_RELIC_SPAN_EVENTS_ENABLED environment variable in the application's environment. NEW_RELIC_SPAN_EVENTS_ENABLED=false Copy Infinite Tracing Infinite Tracing extends the distributed tracing service by employing a trace observer that is external to the agent. It observes 100% of your application traces across various services and provides actionable data so you can solve issues faster. Important Infinite Tracing requires .NET Agent version 8.30 or higher. To turn on Infinite Tracing, enable distributed tracing and add the additional settings below <configuration . . . > <distributedTracing enabled=\"true\" /> <infiniteTracing> <trace_observer host=\"YOUR_TRACE_OBSERVER_HOST\" /> </infiniteTracing> </configuration> Copy The infiniteTracing element supports the following elements: trace_observer The trace_observer element identifies an observer host that is independent from the agent. For help getting a valid Infinite Tracing trace observer host entry, see Find or create a trace observer endpoint. The trace observer may be configured using the NEW_RELIC_INFINITE_TRACING_TRACE_OBSERVER_HOST environment variable as well. Important When configuring the trace observer, you should not supply the protocol as part of the host. For example, use myhost.infinitetracing.com instead of https://myhost.infinitetracing.com. Span events The spanEvents element is a child of the configuration element. Use spanEvents to configure span events. <spanEvents enabled=\"true\"> <attributes enabled=\"true\"> <exclude>myApiKey.*</exclude> <include>myApiKey.foo</include> </attributes> </spanEvents> Copy The spanEvents element supports the following attributes: enabled Type Boolean Default true Enable or disable the event recorder. attributes Use this sub-element to customize your agent attribute settings for span events. This sub-element uses the same settings as the primary attributes element: enabled, include, and exclude. Tip These attribute settings are specific to span events. Attribute settings may be applied globally to all event types to with this configuration setting. Capture HTTP Request Headers The allowAllHeaders element is a child of the configuration element. Set this to true to allow the .NET Agent to capture all HTTP request headers as request.headers.{http-header-name} attributes. Set this to false to only allow the .NET agent to collect the following HTTP request headers: request.headers.referer request.headers.accept request.headers.content-length request.headers.host request.headers.user-agent Copy enabled Type Boolean Default false Enable or disable HTTP request headers capture. Example: <allowAllHeaders enabled=\"true\" /> <attributes enabled=\"true\"> <include>request.headers.*</include> </attributes> Copy Important The allowAllHeaders setting is only available in the .NET Agent version 8.40.0+. When using allowAllHeaders to capture attributes, the captured request header attributes are still being controlled by the root level and destination level attributes settings. Without setting the request.header.* in the include list under the attributes element (see the following), the .NET Agent still filters out all header attributes. The default newrelic.config is set to include the request.header.*. <allowAllHeaders enabled=\"true\" /> <attributes enabled=\"true\"> <include>request.headers.*</include> ... </attributes> Copy The default newrelic.config is also set to explicitly exclude the following HTTP request headers to prevent the .NET Agent collecting unwanted data. <attributes enabled=\"true\"> <exclude>request.headers.cookie</exclude> <exclude>request.headers.authorization</exclude> <exclude>request.headers.proxy-authorization</exclude> <exclude>request.headers.x-*</exclude> </attributes> Copy Settings in app.config or web.config For ASP.NET and .NET Framework console apps you can also configure the following settings in your app's app.config or web.config, within the outermost element, <configuration>: Enable and disable the agent <appSettings> <add key = \"NewRelic.AgentEnabled\" value=\"false\" /> </appSettings> Copy Important If the agent is disabled in the local or global newrelic.config, the NewRelic.AgentEnabled settings in these files will be ignored. Application name For more information, see Name your .NET application. <appSettings> <add key = \"NewRelic.AppName\" value =\"Descriptive Name\" /> </appSettings> Copy License key <appSettings> <add key = \"NewRelic.LicenseKey\" value =\"XXXXXXXX\" /> </appSettings> Copy Change newrelic.config location Designates an alternative location for the config file outside of the local root of the app or global config location. The location entered must be an absolute path. <appSettings> <add key = \"NewRelic.ConfigFile\" value=\"C:\\Path-to-alternate-config-dir\\newrelic.config\" /> </appSettings> Copy Settings in appsettings.json For .NET Core apps, you can configure the following settings in appsettings.json if the following is true: The appsettings.json file must be located in the current working directory of the application. The application must have the following dependencies: Microsoft.Extensions.Configuration Microsoft.Extensions.Configuration.Json Microsoft.Extensions.Configuration.EnvironmentVariables Enable and disable the agent { \"NewRelic.AgentEnabled\":\"false\" } Copy Important If the agent is disabled in the local or global newrelic.config, the NewRelic.AgentEnabled setting in this file will be ignored. Application name For more information, see Name your .NET application. { \"NewRelic.AppName\": \"Descriptive Name\" } Copy License key { \"NewRelic.LicenseKey\": \"XXXXXXXX\" } Copy Change newrelic.config location Designates an alternative location for the config file outside of the local root of the app or global config location. The location entered must be an absolute path. { \"NewRelic.ConfigFile\": \"C:\\\\Path-to-alternate-config-dir\\\\newrelic.config\" } Copy",

      "body": "Problem You are using the Pro + SPA agent, but you are not seeing all of the route change browser interactions you expect. We are aware that this can be frustrating. Our goal throughout 2021 is to reevaluate the SPA feature functionality, making it simpler and more reliable, starting with the methods we use to detect and capture route changes. Additionally, we plan to add new frameworks and use cases to our testing suite based on your feedback and examples. Likely this work will include new APIs as well as framework-specific plug-ins. Check our release notes for the latest updates. Solution Short term solutions To make sure all route changes are captured, you can use our SPA interaction() API. Using the interaction API will categorize the BrowserInteraction event (in the category attribute) as custom rather than a route change if no route change is in fact detected. If your framework is exposing events that represent router activity, you can use custom instrumentation in these events. Here is an example using our API with the Angular router: router.events.subscribe( (event: Event) => { if (event instanceof NavigationStart) { let i = newrelic.interaction() i.setName(event.url) i.save() } }); Copy In this example, the router object is an instance of the Angular router (from the @angular/router module). The setName call sets the name attribute of the BrowserInteraction event to the new URL, and the save call ensures that the interaction is captured. You will need to adapt this for the needs of your own application’s framework. If your framework does not provide routing events, then you can add this code in the event handler of the original interaction event such as click): myButton.addEventListener('click', function () { let i = newrelic.interaction() i.setName(‘new URL') i.save() }); Copy Recommendation: If you do not have access to router events nor the interaction event handler, implement this as soon as possible in code that you know is the result of a user interaction. An alternative to using the SPA API is to capture routes as PageAction events. PageAction events can be used to capture any custom data. We recommend this option as a fallback in case using the SPA interaction API does not work as expected, or to completely separate the custom instrumentation from built-in BrowserInteraction events. Both of these solutions can ensure these events are captured, either as a BrowserInteraction event or as a PageAction event. However, they will not address recording the correct duration and related AJAX calls. Support If this solution does not resolve your issue, please file a support ticket, and have the following information available: For situations where you are seeing most route changes, but none for a particular route change you expect, attempt to evaluate the difference in the implementation of the code for that particular route. Is there something non-standard or unique about that route that you could provide to our support team? Document the frameworks and any libraries that might be of interest. If this is a new problem, has anything changed in your environment that has led to these interactions suddenly not being tracked? Note the browser agent version you are using. If you are more than a few releases behind, we will recommend that you update to the latest release, as we may have already resolved a similar issue. Be aware that due to the complexity of diagnosing these issues, the team will likely need access to an environment and code that demonstrates the problem for testing and research. Cause The browser agent attempts to be framework agnostic, as well as support coding best practices. However, there are often edge cases that will be missed that lead to you not collecting the route changes you expect. The implementation is based on instrumenting most common asynchronous browser APIs. There are cases when a web application uses some asynchronous API or uses custom or third-party code that we do not instrument, and this can result in inaccurate or missed route changes.",

Before you install the browser agent, make sure your system meets these requirements. Want to try out our browser monitoring? Create a New Relic account for free! No credit card required. Basic requirements To report data to browser, your application must at a minimum meet two basic requirements: The traffic to the application must be from clients able to load and execute browser JavaScript code and set cookies. Clients accessing the application must be able to send data to New Relic through HTTP requests. HTTPS is required for browser Pro features. Important Browsers that subscribe to a disconnect list or that use content filtering extensions such as AdBlock may not be able to send data to New Relic. For example, if you are using the Enhanced Tracking Prevention disconnect list for Mozilla Firefox 69.0 or higher, you will need to change the default configuration. Most typical browser applications meet these requirements. However, browser applications in restricted environments may have difficulty reporting data to New Relic; for example: Hybrid mobile applications Applications installed on unusual hardware, such as point-of-sale terminals or consumer appliances For more information, review the instrumentation for browser monitoring documentation, and verify end-user network access. Browser types Instrumentation is compatible with every browser type, including Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox, Microsoft Internet Explorer and Edge, and Apple Safari. The user interface is compatible with New Relic's supported browser versions. Exceptions Comments Paint timings The firstPaint and firstContentfulPaint attributes in BrowserInteraction, PageView, and PageViewTiming events are only compatible with: Chrome 60 or higher for desktop and mobile (Android webview and Chrome for Android) Opera 47 or higher for desktop Opera 44 or higher for Android mobile Samsung Internet for mobile AJAX AJAX timing features are not available with: Chrome for iPhone and iPad IE 7 and 8 PageAction events PageAction events require a browser that fully supports cross-domain XMLHttpRequests. Internet Explorer versions 9 and lower cannot record PageAction events. Learn more on querying your data. Session traces Session traces are reported only from browsers that support the Resource Timing Specification. SHA-256 New Relic can only monitor browsers that are compatible with SHA-256. APM agents You can deploy the browser agent for apps monitored by APM, or you can deploy the browser agent for your standalone apps. For more information, see the installation procedures. If you are deploying browser for an app using APM, make sure your agent supports browser monitoring: C SDK: Version 1.0.0 or higher Go: Version 2.5.0 or higher Java: Version 3.4.0 or higher .NET: Version 2.20.25.0 or higher Node.js: Version 1.4.0 or higher PHP: Version 4.4.5.35 or higher Python: Version 2.10.1.9 or higher Ruby: Version 3.7.0.177 or higher Supported frameworks The browser agent collects data on all front-end frameworks. However, the monitoring occurs on lower-level \"primitives\" that JavaScript frameworks use, so the level of detail collected by the instrumentation may vary depending on your specific framework. Exceptions Comments Zone.js If you're using AngularJS and you want to use our SPA monitoring features, note that Zone.js versions 0.6.18 to 0.6.24 are not compatible with browser. In all cases, the browser agent must be loaded before Zone.js to avoid errors. Cypress.io Browser is unable to properly instrument the open and send methods of requests when tests are run in Cypress. This will cause the following error to be thrown: Cannot set property 'status' of undefined Copy This will only affect customers running tests with the Browser agent present in their code. Production applications should not be affected. html2pdf.js This library is not compatible with our Pro+SPA agent due to the way this library wraps promises. If you're using this library, we recommend selecting the Pro agent type. Content Security Policy (CSP) considerations In order to obtain accurate browser performance metrics, browser requires the use of a small, inline JavaScript snippet. New Relic carefully reviews the inline JavaScript to prevent Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) and other potential vulnerabilities. Content Security Policy Level 2 adds restrictions to the types of JavaScript allowed, such as inline scripts. It also limits which domains can load scripts during page load. Important If your website does not allow any third-party hosted JavaScript to run, you must request a CSP exception via your organization’s standard procedures in order to install the browser monitoring agent. When requesting a CSP exception, follow your organization's standard procedures to contact your web or security team. The browser JavaScript agent requires the following CSP exceptions in order to run properly. Alternatively, you can add all of these exceptions to the fallback default-src directive (instead of script-src and connect-src). CSP exception Comments unsafe-inline Add to the script-src directive or to the fallback default-src directive. This is required because the agent is installed by including an inline script. https://js-agent.newrelic.com Add to the script-src directive or to the fallback default-src directive. This is where additional script files that the agent requires are hosted. https://bam.nr-data.net https://bam-cell.nr-data.net Important Add https://gov-bam.nr-data.net if you're using FedRAMP-compliant endpoints. Add to the script-src directive or to the fallback default-src directive. This is where the agent sends its collected data. One of the calls to this URL is a JSONP call, which means that the URL must be allowed as a script source. Add to the connect-src directive or to the fallback default-src directive. The connect-src directive affects the URLs that scripts can call (for example, using the XMLHttpRequest interface). If you have CSP restrictions specifically around this directive, then add this URL as an exception.",

      "body": "Follow the appropriate procedure to rename your browser app depending on the deployment option you used to add it to browser. Rename app monitored by APM If you added an app to browser already being monitored by APM, the app name that appears in browser is the same as the app name in the APM UI. To rename the app, use any of these options: Option Comments Rename and continue collecting data This option is useful when you simply want to give an app a different display name (alias). To change the alias that appears in the New Relic UI, use the app's Settings page: Go to one.newrelic.com > APM > (select an app) > Settings > Application. Stop reporting under the old name To stop reporting data under the old name and begin collecting data with a new name (app identifer), use the APM agent's configuration file. This changes the identifier that New Relic's data collector uses to distinguish one app from another. Based on the data retention schedule, New Relic will retain historical data collected under the old name, and will collect and aggregate data under the new name. If one or more apps share the same name, then their data will be aggregated in the UI. Caution If you change the app identifier, a new application will appear in our user interface with the new name, and data will stop reporting to the app(s) with the old name. Rename app via JavaScript snippet This information applies if you inserted the browser agent's JavaScript snippet into your: App monitored by APM that was deployed via the copy/paste method Single page app (SPA) Any standalone browser app that is not also monitored by APM You cannot directly edit the JavaScript snippet in the existing app. Instead, to use your app with a different name: Follow standard procedures to create a new app using the copy/paste method. Provide the new name, and generate the JavaScript snippet. Copy the new JavaScript snippet. In your webpage, replace the JavaScript from your original app with the JavaScript generated for the new app name. If your standalone app has multiple names, copy the custom app IDs in your configuration script to your new app. Based on the data retention schedule, New Relic will retain historical data collected under the old name, and will collect and aggregate data under the new name. Rename app via New Relic REST API (v2) This information applies only to browser apps that are also monitored by APM. You cannot change the app name via the REST API if you used the copy/paste method to insert browser's JavaScript snippet into your app. Follow standard procedures to change the APM app alias via REST API or API Explorer. New Relic automatically changes the display name for the app everywhere in the New Relic UI, including browser.",

      "body": "Browser monitoring includes strict security measures to provide a robust, standalone product with browser monitoring features. Before you install the browser agent, make sure your system meets these requirements. Want to try out our browser monitoring? Create a New Relic account for free! No credit card required. Basic requirements To report data to browser, your application must at a minimum meet two basic requirements: The traffic to the application must be from clients able to load and execute browser JavaScript code and set cookies. Clients accessing the application must be able to send data to New Relic through HTTP requests. HTTPS is required for browser Pro features. Important Browsers that subscribe to a disconnect list or that use content filtering extensions such as AdBlock may not be able to send data to New Relic. For example, if you are using the Enhanced Tracking Prevention disconnect list for Mozilla Firefox 69.0 or higher, you will need to change the default configuration. Most typical browser applications meet these requirements. However, browser applications in restricted environments may have difficulty reporting data to New Relic; for example: Hybrid mobile applications Applications installed on unusual hardware, such as point-of-sale terminals or consumer appliances For more information, review the instrumentation for browser monitoring documentation, and verify end-user network access. Browser types Instrumentation is compatible with every browser type, including Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox, Microsoft Internet Explorer and Edge, and Apple Safari. The user interface is compatible with New Relic's supported browser versions. Exceptions Comments Paint timings The firstPaint and firstContentfulPaint attributes in BrowserInteraction, PageView, and PageViewTiming events are only compatible with: Chrome 60 or higher for desktop and mobile (Android webview and Chrome for Android) Opera 47 or higher for desktop Opera 44 or higher for Android mobile Samsung Internet for mobile AJAX AJAX timing features are not available with: Chrome for iPhone and iPad IE 7 and 8 PageAction events PageAction events require a browser that fully supports cross-domain XMLHttpRequests. Internet Explorer versions 9 and lower cannot record PageAction events. Learn more on querying your data. Session traces Session traces are reported only from browsers that support the Resource Timing Specification. SHA-256 New Relic can only monitor browsers that are compatible with SHA-256. APM agents You can deploy the browser agent for apps monitored by APM, or you can deploy the browser agent for your standalone apps. For more information, see the installation procedures. If you are deploying browser for an app using APM, make sure your agent supports browser monitoring: C SDK: Version 1.0.0 or higher Go: Version 2.5.0 or higher Java: Version 3.4.0 or higher .NET: Version 2.20.25.0 or higher Node.js: Version 1.4.0 or higher PHP: Version 4.4.5.35 or higher Python: Version 2.10.1.9 or higher Ruby: Version 3.7.0.177 or higher Supported frameworks The browser agent collects data on all front-end frameworks. However, the monitoring occurs on lower-level \"primitives\" that JavaScript frameworks use, so the level of detail collected by the instrumentation may vary depending on your specific framework. Exceptions Comments Zone.js If you're using AngularJS and you want to use our SPA monitoring features, note that Zone.js versions 0.6.18 to 0.6.24 are not compatible with browser. In all cases, the browser agent must be loaded before Zone.js to avoid errors. Cypress.io Browser is unable to properly instrument the open and send methods of requests when tests are run in Cypress. This will cause the following error to be thrown: Cannot set property 'status' of undefined Copy This will only affect customers running tests with the Browser agent present in their code. Production applications should not be affected. html2pdf.js This library is not compatible with our Pro+SPA agent due to the way this library wraps promises. If you're using this library, we recommend selecting the Pro agent type. Content Security Policy (CSP) considerations In order to obtain accurate browser performance metrics, browser requires the use of a small, inline JavaScript snippet. New Relic carefully reviews the inline JavaScript to prevent Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) and other potential vulnerabilities. Content Security Policy Level 2 adds restrictions to the types of JavaScript allowed, such as inline scripts. It also limits which domains can load scripts during page load. Important If your website does not allow any third-party hosted JavaScript to run, you must request a CSP exception via your organization’s standard procedures in order to install the browser monitoring agent. When requesting a CSP exception, follow your organization's standard procedures to contact your web or security team. The browser JavaScript agent requires the following CSP exceptions in order to run properly. Alternatively, you can add all of these exceptions to the fallback default-src directive (instead of script-src and connect-src). CSP exception Comments unsafe-inline Add to the script-src directive or to the fallback default-src directive. This is required because the agent is installed by including an inline script. https://js-agent.newrelic.com Add to the script-src directive or to the fallback default-src directive. This is where additional script files that the agent requires are hosted. https://bam.nr-data.net https://bam-cell.nr-data.net Important Add https://gov-bam.nr-data.net if you're using FedRAMP-compliant endpoints. Add to the script-src directive or to the fallback default-src directive. This is where the agent sends its collected data. One of the calls to this URL is a JSONP call, which means that the URL must be allowed as a script source. Add to the connect-src directive or to the fallback default-src directive. The connect-src directive affects the URLs that scripts can call (for example, using the XMLHttpRequest interface). If you have CSP restrictions specifically around this directive, then add this URL as an exception.",

However, the monitoring occurs on lower-level \"primitives\" that JavaScript frameworks use, so the level of detail collected by the instrumentation may vary depending on your specific framework. Exceptions Comments Zone.js If you're using AngularJS and you want to use our SPA monitoring features, note that Zone.js versions 0.6.18 to 0.6.24 are not compatible with browser. In all cases, the browser agent must be loaded before Zone.js to avoid errors. Cypress.io Browser is unable to properly instrument the open and send methods of requests when tests are run in Cypress. This will cause the following error to be thrown: Cannot set property 'status' of undefined Copy This will only affect customers running tests with the Browser agent present in their code. Production applications should not be affected. html2pdf.js This library is not compatible with our Pro+SPA agent due to the way this library wraps promises. If you're using this library, we recommend selecting the Pro agent type. Content Security Policy (CSP) considerations In order to obtain accurate browser performance metrics, browser requires the use of a small, inline JavaScript snippet. New Relic carefully reviews the inline JavaScript to prevent Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) and other potential vulnerabilities. Content Security Policy Level 2 adds restrictions to the types of JavaScript allowed, such as inline scripts. It also limits which domains can load scripts during page load. Important If your website does not allow any third-party hosted JavaScript to run, you must request a CSP exception via your organization’s standard procedures in order to install the browser monitoring agent. When requesting a CSP exception, follow your organization's standard procedures to contact your web or security team. The browser JavaScript agent requires the following CSP exceptions in order to run properly. Alternatively, you can add all of these exceptions to the fallback default-src directive (instead of script-src and connect-src). CSP exception Comments unsafe-inline Add to the script-src directive or to the fallback default-src directive. This is required because the agent is installed by including an inline script. https://js-agent.newrelic.com Add to the script-src directive or to the fallback default-src directive. This is where additional script files that the agent requires are hosted. https://bam.nr-data.net https://bam-cell.nr-data.net Important Add https://gov-bam.nr-data.net if you're using FedRAMP-compliant endpoints. Add to the script-src directive or to the fallback default-src directive. This is where the agent sends its collected data. One of the calls to this URL is a JSONP call, which means that the URL must be allowed as a script source. Add to the connect-src directive or to the fallback default-src directive. The connect-src directive affects the URLs that scripts can call (for example, using the XMLHttpRequest interface). If you have CSP restrictions specifically around this directive, then add this URL as an exception.",

      "body": "Follow the appropriate procedure to rename your browser app depending on the deployment option you used to add it to browser. Rename app monitored by APM If you added an app to browser already being monitored by APM, the app name that appears in browser is the same as the app name in the APM UI. To rename the app, use any of these options: Option Comments Rename and continue collecting data This option is useful when you simply want to give an app a different display name (alias). To change the alias that appears in the New Relic UI, use the app's Settings page: Go to one.newrelic.com > APM > (select an app) > Settings > Application. Stop reporting under the old name To stop reporting data under the old name and begin collecting data with a new name (app identifer), use the APM agent's configuration file. This changes the identifier that New Relic's data collector uses to distinguish one app from another. Based on the data retention schedule, New Relic will retain historical data collected under the old name, and will collect and aggregate data under the new name. If one or more apps share the same name, then their data will be aggregated in the UI. Caution If you change the app identifier, a new application will appear in our user interface with the new name, and data will stop reporting to the app(s) with the old name. Rename app via JavaScript snippet This information applies if you inserted the browser agent's JavaScript snippet into your: App monitored by APM that was deployed via the copy/paste method Single page app (SPA) Any standalone browser app that is not also monitored by APM You cannot directly edit the JavaScript snippet in the existing app. Instead, to use your app with a different name: Follow standard procedures to create a new app using the copy/paste method. Provide the new name, and generate the JavaScript snippet. Copy the new JavaScript snippet. In your webpage, replace the JavaScript from your original app with the JavaScript generated for the new app name. If your standalone app has multiple names, copy the custom app IDs in your configuration script to your new app. Based on the data retention schedule, New Relic will retain historical data collected under the old name, and will collect and aggregate data under the new name. Rename app via New Relic REST API (v2) This information applies only to browser apps that are also monitored by APM. You cannot change the app name via the REST API if you used the copy/paste method to insert browser's JavaScript snippet into your app. Follow standard procedures to change the APM app alias via REST API or API Explorer. New Relic automatically changes the display name for the app everywhere in the New Relic UI, including browser.",

Before you install the browser agent, make sure your system meets these requirements. Want to try out our browser monitoring? Create a New Relic account for free! No credit card required. Basic requirements To report data to browser, your application must at a minimum meet two basic requirements: The traffic to the application must be from clients able to load and execute browser JavaScript code and set cookies. Clients accessing the application must be able to send data to New Relic through HTTP requests. HTTPS is required for browser Pro features. Important Browsers that subscribe to a disconnect list or that use content filtering extensions such as AdBlock may not be able to send data to New Relic. For example, if you are using the Enhanced Tracking Prevention disconnect list for Mozilla Firefox 69.0 or higher, you will need to change the default configuration. Most typical browser applications meet these requirements. However, browser applications in restricted environments may have difficulty reporting data to New Relic; for example: Hybrid mobile applications Applications installed on unusual hardware, such as point-of-sale terminals or consumer appliances For more information, review the instrumentation for browser monitoring documentation, and verify end-user network access. Browser types Instrumentation is compatible with every browser type, including Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox, Microsoft Internet Explorer and Edge, and Apple Safari. The user interface is compatible with New Relic's supported browser versions. Exceptions Comments Paint timings The firstPaint and firstContentfulPaint attributes in BrowserInteraction, PageView, and PageViewTiming events are only compatible with: Chrome 60 or higher for desktop and mobile (Android webview and Chrome for Android) Opera 47 or higher for desktop Opera 44 or higher for Android mobile Samsung Internet for mobile AJAX AJAX timing features are not available with: Chrome for iPhone and iPad IE 7 and 8 PageAction events PageAction events require a browser that fully supports cross-domain XMLHttpRequests. Internet Explorer versions 9 and lower cannot record PageAction events. Learn more on querying your data. Session traces Session traces are reported only from browsers that support the Resource Timing Specification. SHA-256 New Relic can only monitor browsers that are compatible with SHA-256. APM agents You can deploy the browser agent for apps monitored by APM, or you can deploy the browser agent for your standalone apps. For more information, see the installation procedures. If you are deploying browser for an app using APM, make sure your agent supports browser monitoring: C SDK: Version 1.0.0 or higher Go: Version 2.5.0 or higher Java: Version 3.4.0 or higher .NET: Version 2.20.25.0 or higher Node.js: Version 1.4.0 or higher PHP: Version 4.4.5.35 or higher Python: Version 2.10.1.9 or higher Ruby: Version 3.7.0.177 or higher Supported frameworks The browser agent collects data on all front-end frameworks.

Before you install the browser agent, make sure your system meets these requirements. Want to try out our browser monitoring? Create a New Relic account for free! No credit card required. Basic requirements To report data to browser, your application must at a minimum meet two basic requirements: The traffic to the application must be from clients able to load and execute browser JavaScript code and set cookies. Clients accessing the application must be able to send data to New Relic through HTTP requests. HTTPS is required for browser Pro features. Important Browsers that subscribe to a disconnect list or that use content filtering extensions such as AdBlock may not be able to send data to New Relic. For example, if you are using the Enhanced Tracking Prevention disconnect list for Mozilla Firefox 69.0 or higher, you will need to change the default configuration. Most typical browser applications meet these requirements. However, browser applications in restricted environments may have difficulty reporting data to New Relic; for example: Hybrid mobile applications Applications installed on unusual hardware, such as point-of-sale terminals or consumer appliances For more information, review the instrumentation for browser monitoring documentation, and verify end-user network access. Browser types Instrumentation is compatible with every browser type, including Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox, Microsoft Internet Explorer and Edge, and Apple Safari. The user interface is compatible with New Relic's supported browser versions. Exceptions Comments Paint timings The firstPaint and firstContentfulPaint attributes in BrowserInteraction, PageView, and PageViewTiming events are only compatible with: Chrome 60 or higher for desktop and mobile (Android webview and Chrome for Android) Opera 47 or higher for desktop Opera 44 or higher for Android mobile Samsung Internet for mobile AJAX AJAX timing features are not available with: Chrome for iPhone and iPad IE 7 and 8 PageAction events PageAction events require a browser that fully supports cross-domain XMLHttpRequests. Internet Explorer versions 9 and lower cannot record PageAction events. Learn more on querying your data. Session traces Session traces are reported only from browsers that support the Resource Timing Specification. SHA-256 New Relic can only monitor browsers that are compatible with SHA-256. APM agents You can deploy the browser agent for apps monitored by APM, or you can deploy the browser agent for your standalone apps. For more information, see the installation procedures. If you are deploying browser for an app using APM, make sure your agent supports browser monitoring: C SDK: Version 1.0.0 or higher Go: Version 2.5.0 or higher Java: Version 3.4.0 or higher .NET: Version 2.20.25.0 or higher Node.js: Version 1.4.0 or higher PHP: Version 4.4.5.35 or higher Python: Version 2.10.1.9 or higher Ruby: Version 3.7.0.177 or higher Supported frameworks The browser agent collects data on all front-end frameworks. However, the monitoring occurs on lower-level \"primitives\" that JavaScript frameworks use, so the level of detail collected by the instrumentation may vary depending on your specific framework. Exceptions Comments Zone.js If you're using AngularJS and you want to use our SPA monitoring features, note that Zone.js versions 0.6.18 to 0.6.24 are not compatible with browser. In all cases, the browser agent must be loaded before Zone.js to avoid errors. Cypress.io Browser is unable to properly instrument the open and send methods of requests when tests are run in Cypress. This will cause the following error to be thrown: Cannot set property 'status' of undefined Copy This will only affect customers running tests with the Browser agent present in their code. Production applications should not be affected. html2pdf.js This library is not compatible with our Pro+SPA agent due to the way this library wraps promises. If you're using this library, we recommend selecting the Pro agent type. Content Security Policy (CSP) considerations In order to obtain accurate browser performance metrics, browser requires the use of a small, inline JavaScript snippet. New Relic carefully reviews the inline JavaScript to prevent Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) and other potential vulnerabilities. Content Security Policy Level 2 adds restrictions to the types of JavaScript allowed, such as inline scripts. It also limits which domains can load scripts during page load. Important If your website does not allow any third-party hosted JavaScript to run, you must request a CSP exception via your organization’s standard procedures in order to install the browser monitoring agent. When requesting a CSP exception, follow your organization's standard procedures to contact your web or security team. The browser JavaScript agent requires the following CSP exceptions in order to run properly. Alternatively, you can add all of these exceptions to the fallback default-src directive (instead of script-src and connect-src). CSP exception Comments unsafe-inline Add to the script-src directive or to the fallback default-src directive. This is required because the agent is installed by including an inline script. https://js-agent.newrelic.com Add to the script-src directive or to the fallback default-src directive. This is where additional script files that the agent requires are hosted. https://bam.nr-data.net https://bam-cell.nr-data.net Important Add https://gov-bam.nr-data.net if you're using FedRAMP-compliant endpoints. Add to the script-src directive or to the fallback default-src directive. This is where the agent sends its collected data. One of the calls to this URL is a JSONP call, which means that the URL must be allowed as a script source. Add to the connect-src directive or to the fallback default-src directive. The connect-src directive affects the URLs that scripts can call (for example, using the XMLHttpRequest interface). If you have CSP restrictions specifically around this directive, then add this URL as an exception.",

Rename app monitored by APM If you added an app to browser already being monitored by APM, the app name that appears in browser is the same as the app name in the APM UI. To rename the app, use any of these options: Option Comments Rename and continue collecting data This option is useful when you simply want to give an app a different display name (alias). To change the alias that appears in the New Relic UI, use the app's Settings page: Go to one.newrelic.com > APM > (select an app) > Settings > Application. Stop reporting under the old name To stop reporting data under the old name and begin collecting data with a new name (app identifer), use the APM agent's configuration file. This changes the identifier that New Relic's data collector uses to distinguish one app from another. Based on the data retention schedule, New Relic will retain historical data collected under the old name, and will collect and aggregate data under the new name. If one or more apps share the same name, then their data will be aggregated in the UI. Caution If you change the app identifier, a new application will appear in our user interface with the new name, and data will stop reporting to the app(s) with the old name. Rename app via JavaScript snippet This information applies if you inserted the browser agent's JavaScript snippet into your: App monitored by APM that was deployed via the copy/paste method Single page app (SPA) Any standalone browser app that is not also monitored by APM You cannot directly edit the JavaScript snippet in the existing app. Instead, to use your app with a different name: Follow standard procedures to create a new app using the copy/paste method. Provide the new name, and generate the JavaScript snippet. Copy the new JavaScript snippet. In your webpage, replace the JavaScript from your original app with the JavaScript generated for the new app name. If your standalone app has multiple names, copy the custom app IDs in your configuration script to your new app. Based on the data retention schedule, New Relic will retain historical data collected under the old name, and will collect and aggregate data under the new name. Rename app via New Relic REST API (v2) This information applies only to browser apps that are also monitored by APM. You cannot change the app name via the REST API if you used the copy/paste method to insert browser's JavaScript snippet into your app. Follow standard procedures to change the APM app alias via REST API or API Explorer.

      "body": "Your end-user experience depends on your entire technology stack. You need to quickly understand what's causing a customer complaint or issue. Did the problem come from your infrastructure, your application, or the browsers that ultimately render it? Is it the result of a problematic internet provider, a problem in your own data center with failing CPU or memory, or something else? More than Real User Monitoring (RUM) Many websites contain dynamic content that is loaded after the initial page has finished loading, and complex JavaScript code increases the need for error reporting. Browser monitoring in New Relic One provides a Real User Monitoring (RUM) solution that measures the speed and performance of your end users as they navigate to your site from different web browsers, devices, operating systems, and networks. With browser monitoring in New Relic One, you see actionable data about your end users' experience with your app. But browser monitoring in New Relic goes far beyond the initial page load to measure full page life cycle data. For example, our browser UI shows you: Actual performance data, such as by page view popularity and user satisfaction (Apdex) scores Perceived performance data that measures how quickly your async or dynamic visuals and interactive page contents display JavaScript error analytics, stack traces, and line-of-code visibility, to show you the end-user steps leading up to an error itself Session performance with a detailed timeline and heat map of the load and interaction events during a webpage's full life cycle AJAX requests indicating problems with timing, end points, and specific locations in the webpage Hash-based route changes in apps with single-page application (SPA) architectures These tools (and more!) help your teams optimize your end users' page load experience, eliminate bugs, and troubleshoot faster across your full stack. Examine user perceptions Real user data gives insights into actual page performance, but you also need to look into your users' perception of your site's performance. Pages can load content in many different ways, and users control when they interact with that content. This is why some user-centric performance metrics happen outside the standard window onload (page load time) in the browser monitoring agent. The PageViewTiming event provides a more real-time delivery mechanism that does not have a dependency on any other event. Additional metrics include: First paint, first contentful paint, and largest contentful paint First input delay First interaction This helps you understand how users experience your site, both from visual and responsiveness standpoints. Improve interactive app performance Our single-page app (SPA) monitoring automatically tracks route changes, initial page loads, and synchronous and asynchronous activity during browser interactions. You can also use our browser agent and SPA API to monitor virtually anything that executes inside the browser. If you are a developer, SPA monitoring can help you: Create faster, more responsive, highly interactive apps. Monitor the throughput and performance that real users are experiencing. Troubleshoot and resolve problems within the context of the page load. Query and visualize the data to assist with business decisions. Bring better apps to the marketplace more quickly. Correlate front-end and back-end problems With New Relic One, you can instrument any type of data you need, such as metrics, events, logs, and traces. This helps you find actionable data about your end users' experience across the stack. For example: Full-Stack Observability Comments Locations or domains Limit browser monitoring to focus on specific geographical locations or specific types of end-user activity. You can also monitor or block specific domains. Trends in interactions Use our comparative charting feature for a direct page load time comparison between real user (browser) interactions and trends appearing in Synthetic monitors. Distributed tracing Isolate latency from the web browser through back-end services with distributed tracing. The UI helps you see the connection across across a full transaction, from browser activity, to time spent in network, to back-end activity. Browser types Explore your end users' experience with your app segmented by any types of browsers they use, including: Top browsers by throughput Average page load time by platform type (mobile, desktop, and other) Selected browser type by version (for example, Chrome 31, 32, 33, etc.) This helps you quickly determine whether problems with page load timing may be related to a specific browser type or platform, or whether the problem is more widespread. Get started with browser monitoring Follow these basic steps, and you'll quickly be up and running in New Relic with browser monitoring! Review the compatibility details and basic requirements for browser monitoring. Install the browser agent. Go to [one.newrelic.com > Explorer > Browser applications. Use the Explorer to access all your entities, that is, anything we can identify that reports data, from applications and hosts to custom groupings of any elements. View summary data from your Browser summary page, then drill down into page load timing details and other UI data. Configure your alerts for key performance data, or use our Applied Intelligence solutions to reduce alert noise, correlate incidents, and automatically detect anomalies. Query and visualize your default data (or customize your own), then analyze what that data says about your business. Customize and share your own charts and dashboards.",

      "body": "Your end-user experience depends on your entire technology stack. You need to quickly understand what's causing a customer complaint or issue. Did the problem come from your infrastructure, your application, or the browsers that ultimately render it? Is it the result of a problematic internet provider, a problem in your own data center with failing CPU or memory, or something else? More than Real User Monitoring (RUM) Many websites contain dynamic content that is loaded after the initial page has finished loading, and complex JavaScript code increases the need for error reporting. Browser monitoring in New Relic One provides a Real User Monitoring (RUM) solution that measures the speed and performance of your end users as they navigate to your site from different web browsers, devices, operating systems, and networks. With browser monitoring in New Relic One, you see actionable data about your end users' experience with your app. But browser monitoring in New Relic goes far beyond the initial page load to measure full page life cycle data. For example, our browser UI shows you: Actual performance data, such as by page view popularity and user satisfaction (Apdex) scores Perceived performance data that measures how quickly your async or dynamic visuals and interactive page contents display JavaScript error analytics, stack traces, and line-of-code visibility, to show you the end-user steps leading up to an error itself Session performance with a detailed timeline and heat map of the load and interaction events during a webpage's full life cycle AJAX requests indicating problems with timing, end points, and specific locations in the webpage Hash-based route changes in apps with single-page application (SPA) architectures These tools (and more!) help your teams optimize your end users' page load experience, eliminate bugs, and troubleshoot faster across your full stack. Examine user perceptions Real user data gives insights into actual page performance, but you also need to look into your users' perception of your site's performance. Pages can load content in many different ways, and users control when they interact with that content. This is why some user-centric performance metrics happen outside the standard window onload (page load time) in the browser monitoring agent. The PageViewTiming event provides a more real-time delivery mechanism that does not have a dependency on any other event. Additional metrics include: First paint, first contentful paint, and largest contentful paint First input delay First interaction This helps you understand how users experience your site, both from visual and responsiveness standpoints. Improve interactive app performance Our single-page app (SPA) monitoring automatically tracks route changes, initial page loads, and synchronous and asynchronous activity during browser interactions. You can also use our browser agent and SPA API to monitor virtually anything that executes inside the browser. If you are a developer, SPA monitoring can help you: Create faster, more responsive, highly interactive apps. Monitor the throughput and performance that real users are experiencing. Troubleshoot and resolve problems within the context of the page load. Query and visualize the data to assist with business decisions. Bring better apps to the marketplace more quickly. Correlate front-end and back-end problems With New Relic One, you can instrument any type of data you need, such as metrics, events, logs, and traces. This helps you find actionable data about your end users' experience across the stack. For example: Full-Stack Observability Comments Locations or domains Limit browser monitoring to focus on specific geographical locations or specific types of end-user activity. You can also monitor or block specific domains. Trends in interactions Use our comparative charting feature for a direct page load time comparison between real user (browser) interactions and trends appearing in Synthetic monitors. Distributed tracing Isolate latency from the web browser through back-end services with distributed tracing. The UI helps you see the connection across across a full transaction, from browser activity, to time spent in network, to back-end activity. Browser types Explore your end users' experience with your app segmented by any types of browsers they use, including: Top browsers by throughput Average page load time by platform type (mobile, desktop, and other) Selected browser type by version (for example, Chrome 31, 32, 33, etc.) This helps you quickly determine whether problems with page load timing may be related to a specific browser type or platform, or whether the problem is more widespread. Get started with browser monitoring Follow these basic steps, and you'll quickly be up and running in New Relic with browser monitoring! Review the compatibility details and basic requirements for browser monitoring. Install the browser agent. Go to [one.newrelic.com > Explorer > Browser applications. Use the Explorer to access all your entities, that is, anything we can identify that reports data, from applications and hosts to custom groupings of any elements. View summary data from your Browser summary page, then drill down into page load timing details and other UI data. Configure your alerts for key performance data, or use our Applied Intelligence solutions to reduce alert noise, correlate incidents, and automatically detect anomalies. Query and visualize your default data (or customize your own), then analyze what that data says about your business. Customize and share your own charts and dashboards.",

      "body": "Before you install New Relic's Python agent, make sure your system meets these requirements. Basic requirements The Python agent supports many of the most common Python web frameworks. Additional configuration may be required depending on your specific hosting mechanism, hosting service, web framework, or back-end services. If you don't have one already, create a New Relic account. It's free, forever. Resource Requirements Operating systems UNIX-like operating systems including Linux, Solaris, FreeBSD, and macOS. The Python agent does not support Windows environments. Python Python (CPython/PyPy) versions supported: 2.7, 3.5, 3.6, 3.7, 3.8, and 3.9. Recommendation: Use Python version 3.6 or higher with our agent. Python versions 2.6 and 3.3 are supported only by Python agent versions 3.4.0.95 or lower. Python version 3.4 is supported only by Python agent versions 4.20.0.120 or lower. Python versions 2.7 and 3.5 follow our end of life (EOL) support requirements. Supported web frameworks Supported web frameworks include: Aiohttp Bottle CherryPy Django Falcon FastAPI Flask gRPC Pylons Pyramid Sanic Starlette Tornado 6 Web2Py Unsupported frameworks Some WSGI servers, frameworks, and apps have special requirements. Although a specific Python WSGI web framework may not be supported, you can still use the agent. For unsupported frameworks, a breakout of time spent in key parts of the framework will not appear in web transaction performance breakdowns and transaction traces. In addition, the agent will not be able to meaningfully group any web transactions handled by specific handlers in your code that you use to make them more useful and targeted. In these situations you can use the Python agent API to name web transactions or add custom instrumentation. Hosting Web hosting mechanisms compliant with WSGI 1.0 (PEP 333). For example, you can install the Python agent in a Google App Engine flexible environment. Security requirements As a standard security measure for data collection, your app server must support SHA-2 (256-bit). SHA-1 is not supported. Other monitoring software If your application uses other monitoring software besides ours, we cannot guarantee that our agent will work correctly and we cannot offer technical support. For more information, see Errors while using other monitoring software. Python package instrumentation The agent also provides instrumentation for a range of other Python packages and modules. Instrumentation includes database queries, memcache requests, external service requests, instance-level details, and more. The results will appear automatically in APM's user interface within web transaction performance breakdowns and transaction traces for slow transactions. Python version support The agent in general will support all released and active Python branches. However, to keep up with upcoming changes, the agent will also follow this Python version support schedule. The version support policy does not replace the general New Relic agent and plugin end-of-life (EOL) policy. Support for new Python releases The following are proposed time ranges. The actual release date may vary. Python version Active long term support (LTS) start date Initial release date of Python agent with support 3.8 October 21, 2019 November-December 2019 End of support for Python releases reaching EOL The following are proposed time ranges. The actual release date may vary. Python version End of life (EOL) date Initial release date of Python agent dropping support 3.5 September 13, 2020 Deprecated as of Python agent version 5.22.0.151 Python agent versions released after December 22, 2020 do not support Python 3.5. For more information, see our Python agent release notes and our Explorers Hub post. 2.7 January 1, 2020 TBD Connect the agent to other Full-Stack Observability capabilities The Python agent integrates with other capabilities to give you end-to-end visibility: Product Integration Browser monitoring The Python agent automatically injects the browser JavaScript agent when you enable auto-instrumentation. After enabling browser injection, you can view browser data in the APM Summary page and quickly switch between the APM and browser data for a particular app. For configuration options and manual instrumentation, see Browser monitoring and the Python agent. Infrastructure monitoring When you install the Infrastructure monitoring and APM agents on the same host, they automatically detect one another. You can then view a list of hosts in the APM UI, and filter your Infrastructure hosts by APM app in the Infrastructure monitoring UI. For more information, see APM data in Infrastructure. Synthetic monitoring Synthetic transaction traces connect requests from synthetic monitors to the underlying APM transaction.",

Before you install the browser agent, make sure your system meets these requirements. Want to try out our browser monitoring? Create a New Relic account for free! No credit card required. Basic requirements To report data to browser, your application must at a minimum meet two basic requirements: The traffic to the application must be from clients able to load and execute browser JavaScript code and set cookies. Clients accessing the application must be able to send data to New Relic through HTTP requests. HTTPS is required for browser Pro features. Important Browsers that subscribe to a disconnect list or that use content filtering extensions such as AdBlock may not be able to send data to New Relic. For example, if you are using the Enhanced Tracking Prevention disconnect list for Mozilla Firefox 69.0 or higher, you will need to change the default configuration. Most typical browser applications meet these requirements. However, browser applications in restricted environments may have difficulty reporting data to New Relic; for example: Hybrid mobile applications Applications installed on unusual hardware, such as point-of-sale terminals or consumer appliances For more information, review the instrumentation for browser monitoring documentation, and verify end-user network access. Browser types Instrumentation is compatible with every browser type, including Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox, Microsoft Internet Explorer and Edge, and Apple Safari. The user interface is compatible with New Relic's supported browser versions. Exceptions Comments Paint timings The firstPaint and firstContentfulPaint attributes in BrowserInteraction, PageView, and PageViewTiming events are only compatible with: Chrome 60 or higher for desktop and mobile (Android webview and Chrome for Android) Opera 47 or higher for desktop Opera 44 or higher for Android mobile Samsung Internet for mobile AJAX AJAX timing features are not available with: Chrome for iPhone and iPad IE 7 and 8 PageAction events PageAction events require a browser that fully supports cross-domain XMLHttpRequests. Internet Explorer versions 9 and lower cannot record PageAction events. Learn more on querying your data. Session traces Session traces are reported only from browsers that support the Resource Timing Specification. SHA-256 New Relic can only monitor browsers that are compatible with SHA-256. APM agents You can deploy the browser agent for apps monitored by APM, or you can deploy the browser agent for your standalone apps. For more information, see the installation procedures. If you are deploying browser for an app using APM, make sure your agent supports browser monitoring: C SDK: Version 1.0.0 or higher Go: Version 2.5.0 or higher Java: Version 3.4.0 or higher .NET: Version 2.20.25.0 or higher Node.js: Version 1.4.0 or higher PHP: Version 4.4.5.35 or higher Python: Version 2.10.1.9 or higher Ruby: Version 3.7.0.177 or higher Supported frameworks The browser agent collects data on all front-end frameworks. However, the monitoring occurs on lower-level \"primitives\" that JavaScript frameworks use, so the level of detail collected by the instrumentation may vary depending on your specific framework. Exceptions Comments Zone.js If you're using AngularJS and you want to use our SPA monitoring features, note that Zone.js versions 0.6.18 to 0.6.24 are not compatible with browser. In all cases, the browser agent must be loaded before Zone.js to avoid errors. Cypress.io Browser is unable to properly instrument the open and send methods of requests when tests are run in Cypress. This will cause the following error to be thrown: Cannot set property 'status' of undefined Copy This will only affect customers running tests with the Browser agent present in their code. Production applications should not be affected. html2pdf.js This library is not compatible with our Pro+SPA agent due to the way this library wraps promises. If you're using this library, we recommend selecting the Pro agent type. Content Security Policy (CSP) considerations In order to obtain accurate browser performance metrics, browser requires the use of a small, inline JavaScript snippet. New Relic carefully reviews the inline JavaScript to prevent Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) and other potential vulnerabilities. Content Security Policy Level 2 adds restrictions to the types of JavaScript allowed, such as inline scripts. It also limits which domains can load scripts during page load. Important If your website does not allow any third-party hosted JavaScript to run, you must request a CSP exception via your organization’s standard procedures in order to install the browser monitoring agent. When requesting a CSP exception, follow your organization's standard procedures to contact your web or security team. The browser JavaScript agent requires the following CSP exceptions in order to run properly. Alternatively, you can add all of these exceptions to the fallback default-src directive (instead of script-src and connect-src). CSP exception Comments unsafe-inline Add to the script-src directive or to the fallback default-src directive. This is required because the agent is installed by including an inline script. https://js-agent.newrelic.com Add to the script-src directive or to the fallback default-src directive. This is where additional script files that the agent requires are hosted. https://bam.nr-data.net https://bam-cell.nr-data.net Important Add https://gov-bam.nr-data.net if you're using FedRAMP-compliant endpoints. Add to the script-src directive or to the fallback default-src directive. This is where the agent sends its collected data. One of the calls to this URL is a JSONP call, which means that the URL must be allowed as a script source. Add to the connect-src directive or to the fallback default-src directive. The connect-src directive affects the URLs that scripts can call (for example, using the XMLHttpRequest interface). If you have CSP restrictions specifically around this directive, then add this URL as an exception.",

      "body": "Your end-user experience depends on your entire technology stack. You need to quickly understand what's causing a customer complaint or issue. Did the problem come from your infrastructure, your application, or the browsers that ultimately render it? Is it the result of a problematic internet provider, a problem in your own data center with failing CPU or memory, or something else? More than Real User Monitoring (RUM) Many websites contain dynamic content that is loaded after the initial page has finished loading, and complex JavaScript code increases the need for error reporting. Browser monitoring in New Relic One provides a Real User Monitoring (RUM) solution that measures the speed and performance of your end users as they navigate to your site from different web browsers, devices, operating systems, and networks. With browser monitoring in New Relic One, you see actionable data about your end users' experience with your app. But browser monitoring in New Relic goes far beyond the initial page load to measure full page life cycle data. For example, our browser UI shows you: Actual performance data, such as by page view popularity and user satisfaction (Apdex) scores Perceived performance data that measures how quickly your async or dynamic visuals and interactive page contents display JavaScript error analytics, stack traces, and line-of-code visibility, to show you the end-user steps leading up to an error itself Session performance with a detailed timeline and heat map of the load and interaction events during a webpage's full life cycle AJAX requests indicating problems with timing, end points, and specific locations in the webpage Hash-based route changes in apps with single-page application (SPA) architectures These tools (and more!) help your teams optimize your end users' page load experience, eliminate bugs, and troubleshoot faster across your full stack. Examine user perceptions Real user data gives insights into actual page performance, but you also need to look into your users' perception of your site's performance. Pages can load content in many different ways, and users control when they interact with that content. This is why some user-centric performance metrics happen outside the standard window onload (page load time) in the browser monitoring agent. The PageViewTiming event provides a more real-time delivery mechanism that does not have a dependency on any other event. Additional metrics include: First paint, first contentful paint, and largest contentful paint First input delay First interaction This helps you understand how users experience your site, both from visual and responsiveness standpoints. Improve interactive app performance Our single-page app (SPA) monitoring automatically tracks route changes, initial page loads, and synchronous and asynchronous activity during browser interactions. You can also use our browser agent and SPA API to monitor virtually anything that executes inside the browser. If you are a developer, SPA monitoring can help you: Create faster, more responsive, highly interactive apps. Monitor the throughput and performance that real users are experiencing. Troubleshoot and resolve problems within the context of the page load. Query and visualize the data to assist with business decisions. Bring better apps to the marketplace more quickly. Correlate front-end and back-end problems With New Relic One, you can instrument any type of data you need, such as metrics, events, logs, and traces. This helps you find actionable data about your end users' experience across the stack. For example: Full-Stack Observability Comments Locations or domains Limit browser monitoring to focus on specific geographical locations or specific types of end-user activity. You can also monitor or block specific domains. Trends in interactions Use our comparative charting feature for a direct page load time comparison between real user (browser) interactions and trends appearing in Synthetic monitors. Distributed tracing Isolate latency from the web browser through back-end services with distributed tracing. The UI helps you see the connection across across a full transaction, from browser activity, to time spent in network, to back-end activity. Browser types Explore your end users' experience with your app segmented by any types of browsers they use, including: Top browsers by throughput Average page load time by platform type (mobile, desktop, and other) Selected browser type by version (for example, Chrome 31, 32, 33, etc.) This helps you quickly determine whether problems with page load timing may be related to a specific browser type or platform, or whether the problem is more widespread. Get started with browser monitoring Follow these basic steps, and you'll quickly be up and running in New Relic with browser monitoring! Review the compatibility details and basic requirements for browser monitoring. Install the browser agent. Go to [one.newrelic.com > Explorer > Browser applications. Use the Explorer to access all your entities, that is, anything we can identify that reports data, from applications and hosts to custom groupings of any elements. View summary data from your Browser summary page, then drill down into page load timing details and other UI data. Configure your alerts for key performance data, or use our Applied Intelligence solutions to reduce alert noise, correlate incidents, and automatically detect anomalies. Query and visualize your default data (or customize your own), then analyze what that data says about your business. Customize and share your own charts and dashboards.",

To install the browser agent, you can choose from a number of deployment options. If you don't have one already, create a New Relic account. It's free, forever. Enable browser monitoring Browser Pro+SPA is the default agent when you enable browser monitoring. This automatically gives you access to all of our browser monitoring features. For more information about the browser monitoring options, see Browser agent types in this document. To enable browser monitoring: Go to one.newrelic.com, select Browser, and then select Add more data. Follow the instructions in the UI to add browser monitoring to your app. Generate some traffic for your app, then wait a few minutes for data to appear in New Relic. Optional: After installation is complete and you are seeing data, go to the App settings page for additional agent configuration, or to change the browser agent type. It may take several minutes after enabling the browser monitoring agent before your webpage data appear in New Relic. If have problems, follow our troubleshooting tips. Deployment options No matter which option you use to deploy browser monitoring, the end result is the same: the browser monitoring JavaScript snippet (also referred to as the \"agent\") is inserted into your app pages. The method you select depends on your preferences and business needs. Enable an APM-monitored app When enabling browser monitoring, you can use an APM agent to automatically inject the browser monitoring JavaScript snippet for you. This is the easiest way to install the agent for an app that's already being monitored by APM. APM-monitored apps are listed on your APM Applications index. Enable with copy/paste When enabling browser monitoring, you can manually insert the JavaScript snippet into your app's webpages. The copy/paste option gives you control over the exact placement of our JavaScript snippet, which is required to monitor the webpage's performance. This is useful for: Standalone apps, static sites, and cached pages delivered by CDN APM apps that are not as closely coupled to the browser app as with a standard server-side app (for example, when your client-side app talks to a REST API back end) Some tips for using the JavaScript snippet: Placement in your webpage: Copy the code snippet, then paste it inline into your pages as close to the top of the <head> element as possible, but after any position-sensitive <meta> tags (for example, X-UA-Compatible or charset information). For more information on the inline head placement, see JavaScript placement requirements. License key and app ID: Near the bottom of the generated JavaScript is your browser license key and application ID. This is useful with the REST API and API Explorer. Instrument webpages using the APM agent This information applies to apps that are also monitored by APM. Our APM agents can instrument webpages with the required JavaScript for page load timing. If you are using an APM agent's API to manually add the JavaScript snippet to your webpages, insert the instrumentation snippet as close to the top as possible. This allows you to take advantage of detailed information about browser's AJAX calls and JavaScript errors. For more information, see the instructions for your APM agent: C SDK Go Java .NET Node.js PHP Python Ruby Use REST API This information applies to apps that are also monitored by APM. The REST API lets you manage deployment outside the browser monitoring UI. This is useful for large organizations deploying multiple apps. Browser agent types: Lite, Pro, Pro+SPA We have three types of browser agents: Lite, Pro, and Pro+SPA. The agent type has no impact on your billing. Browser agent type Comparison Pro+SPA This is the default installed agent when you enable browser monitoring. What it includes: Gives you access to all of the Browser Pro features and to Single Page App (SPA) monitoring. Provides detailed page timing data and the most up-to-date New Relic features, including distributed tracing, for all types of applications. Pro+SPA is not limited only to single page applications. After install, you can downgrade anytime to the less advanced agents if you don't want or need SPA monitoring. Pro What it includes: Gives you access to the Browser Pro features. What it doesn't include: Lacks the functionality designed for single page app monitoring. Lite What it includes: Gives you information about some basic page load timing and browser user information. What it doesn't include: Lacks the Browser Pro features and SPA features. Details about how agent types relate to pricing: New Relic One pricing: This pricing plan has data ingest as a billing factor. If you want to reduce data ingest, you may want to consider downgrading to lesser agent types after install. Original pricing: Your access to browser monitoring features is gated by your subscription plan, not by the agent type. This means there is no reason not to use the default Pro+SPA agent. After initial agent installation is finished, you can go to the App settings page to edit your configuration or to change your subscription.",

      "body": "Running the latest version of our browser agent ensures you can access all browser features and enhancements. To update to the latest version, check your version number, then follow the steps for either updating an APM-managed installation or upgrading a copy/paste installation. Check your version number To verify your browser version number: View the source code of a page which includes the JavaScript snippet. Search the page source for js-agent.newrelic.com/nr-. The numbers that follow nr- are your current version. For example, js-agent.newrelic.com/nr-593.min.js indicates you are running version 593 of the browser script. There are different agent types. The Pro+SPA agent has the format js-agent.newrelic.com/nr-spa-1184.min.js To verify the latest version of the browser script loader: Go to js-agent.newrelic.com/nr-loader-full-current.min.js . Search for js-agent.newrelic.com/nr-, then note the numbers that follow nr-. If the latest version number is higher than the number of the version you are currently running, update your browser agent. Check deployment method Your browser agent may have been deployed in two ways: either using a manual implementation (copying and pasting the snippet) or automatically instrumented using an APM agent. To check which deployment method was used, run this command in the JavaScript console: > newrelic.info.sa Copy If the command returns 1, then your browser agent used the copy/paste method. Update your APM-managed installation To update your APM-managed browser installation, restart your APM agent. Your app will automatically update to the latest JavaScript snippet. To ensure the new script registers, you may need to clear your cache. For more information, follow the troubleshooting procedures to manually check and clear the cache. Update your copy/paste installation Use any of the following options to access the browser JavaScript snippet needed to update a copy/paste installation. After accessing the snippet, be sure to replace all of your existing snippet with the new version. If you have a standalone installation with a few applications, you can retrieve the snippet from the UI, and then replace it with the new version. If you have many applications, you can use the REST API or the loader endpoint to automate the update process. Caution Do not simply change the version number in the existing snippet. This can result in incomplete data collection. For best results after you use any of the following options, always update the agent. Retrieve the snippet from the UI Download the latest version of the snippet: Go to one.newrelic.com > Browser > (select an app) > Application settings. This option is only available for standalone installations. Extract the snippet with the REST API To update the snippet using the New Relic REST API, follow the process for viewing a specific browser app. The loader_script attribute in your response will include the latest JavaScript snippet. This may be a good solution if you have many applications to manage, or if your browser app is linked to an APM app. Update using the loader endpoint To update the snippet from the New Relic loader endpoint, you can choose which type of browser agent you want: Pro+SPA endpoint Pro endpoint Lite endpoint These endpoints always point to the latest version of the agent. We recommend using the Pro+SPA agent. Read more about these agent types. These loader endpoints are generic and do not include your specific configuration data. To add your configuration data to the loaders: Find your browser application ID and license key: Follow standard procedures to use the New Relic UI or the REST API. Set your browser application ID and license key immediately after the snippet. NREUM.info = { applicationID: \"YOUR-APPLICATION-ID\", licenseKey: \"YOUR-BROWSER-LICENSE-KEY\" }; Copy",

      "body": "Browser monitoring includes strict security measures to provide a robust, standalone product with browser monitoring features. Before you install the browser agent, make sure your system meets these requirements. Want to try out our browser monitoring? Create a New Relic account for free! No credit card required. Basic requirements To report data to browser, your application must at a minimum meet two basic requirements: The traffic to the application must be from clients able to load and execute browser JavaScript code and set cookies. Clients accessing the application must be able to send data to New Relic through HTTP requests. HTTPS is required for browser Pro features. Important Browsers that subscribe to a disconnect list or that use content filtering extensions such as AdBlock may not be able to send data to New Relic. For example, if you are using the Enhanced Tracking Prevention disconnect list for Mozilla Firefox 69.0 or higher, you will need to change the default configuration. Most typical browser applications meet these requirements. However, browser applications in restricted environments may have difficulty reporting data to New Relic; for example: Hybrid mobile applications Applications installed on unusual hardware, such as point-of-sale terminals or consumer appliances For more information, review the instrumentation for browser monitoring documentation, and verify end-user network access. Browser types Instrumentation is compatible with every browser type, including Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox, Microsoft Internet Explorer and Edge, and Apple Safari. The user interface is compatible with New Relic's supported browser versions. Exceptions Comments Paint timings The firstPaint and firstContentfulPaint attributes in BrowserInteraction, PageView, and PageViewTiming events are only compatible with: Chrome 60 or higher for desktop and mobile (Android webview and Chrome for Android) Opera 47 or higher for desktop Opera 44 or higher for Android mobile Samsung Internet for mobile AJAX AJAX timing features are not available with: Chrome for iPhone and iPad IE 7 and 8 PageAction events PageAction events require a browser that fully supports cross-domain XMLHttpRequests. Internet Explorer versions 9 and lower cannot record PageAction events. Learn more on querying your data. Session traces Session traces are reported only from browsers that support the Resource Timing Specification. SHA-256 New Relic can only monitor browsers that are compatible with SHA-256. APM agents You can deploy the browser agent for apps monitored by APM, or you can deploy the browser agent for your standalone apps. For more information, see the installation procedures. If you are deploying browser for an app using APM, make sure your agent supports browser monitoring: C SDK: Version 1.0.0 or higher Go: Version 2.5.0 or higher Java: Version 3.4.0 or higher .NET: Version 2.20.25.0 or higher Node.js: Version 1.4.0 or higher PHP: Version 4.4.5.35 or higher Python: Version 2.10.1.9 or higher Ruby: Version 3.7.0.177 or higher Supported frameworks The browser agent collects data on all front-end frameworks. However, the monitoring occurs on lower-level \"primitives\" that JavaScript frameworks use, so the level of detail collected by the instrumentation may vary depending on your specific framework. Exceptions Comments Zone.js If you're using AngularJS and you want to use our SPA monitoring features, note that Zone.js versions 0.6.18 to 0.6.24 are not compatible with browser. In all cases, the browser agent must be loaded before Zone.js to avoid errors. Cypress.io Browser is unable to properly instrument the open and send methods of requests when tests are run in Cypress. This will cause the following error to be thrown: Cannot set property 'status' of undefined Copy This will only affect customers running tests with the Browser agent present in their code. Production applications should not be affected. html2pdf.js This library is not compatible with our Pro+SPA agent due to the way this library wraps promises. If you're using this library, we recommend selecting the Pro agent type. Content Security Policy (CSP) considerations In order to obtain accurate browser performance metrics, browser requires the use of a small, inline JavaScript snippet. New Relic carefully reviews the inline JavaScript to prevent Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) and other potential vulnerabilities. Content Security Policy Level 2 adds restrictions to the types of JavaScript allowed, such as inline scripts. It also limits which domains can load scripts during page load. Important If your website does not allow any third-party hosted JavaScript to run, you must request a CSP exception via your organization’s standard procedures in order to install the browser monitoring agent. When requesting a CSP exception, follow your organization's standard procedures to contact your web or security team. The browser JavaScript agent requires the following CSP exceptions in order to run properly. Alternatively, you can add all of these exceptions to the fallback default-src directive (instead of script-src and connect-src). CSP exception Comments unsafe-inline Add to the script-src directive or to the fallback default-src directive. This is required because the agent is installed by including an inline script. https://js-agent.newrelic.com Add to the script-src directive or to the fallback default-src directive. This is where additional script files that the agent requires are hosted. https://bam.nr-data.net https://bam-cell.nr-data.net Important Add https://gov-bam.nr-data.net if you're using FedRAMP-compliant endpoints. Add to the script-src directive or to the fallback default-src directive. This is where the agent sends its collected data. One of the calls to this URL is a JSONP call, which means that the URL must be allowed as a script source. Add to the connect-src directive or to the fallback default-src directive. The connect-src directive affects the URLs that scripts can call (for example, using the XMLHttpRequest interface). If you have CSP restrictions specifically around this directive, then add this URL as an exception.",

To install the browser agent, you can choose from a number of deployment options. If you don't have one already, create a New Relic account. It's free, forever. Enable browser monitoring Browser Pro+SPA is the default agent when you enable browser monitoring. This automatically gives you access to all of our browser monitoring features. For more information about the browser monitoring options, see Browser agent types in this document. To enable browser monitoring: Go to one.newrelic.com, select Browser, and then select Add more data. Follow the instructions in the UI to add browser monitoring to your app. Generate some traffic for your app, then wait a few minutes for data to appear in New Relic. Optional: After installation is complete and you are seeing data, go to the App settings page for additional agent configuration, or to change the browser agent type. It may take several minutes after enabling the browser monitoring agent before your webpage data appear in New Relic. If have problems, follow our troubleshooting tips. Deployment options No matter which option you use to deploy browser monitoring, the end result is the same: the browser monitoring JavaScript snippet (also referred to as the \"agent\") is inserted into your app pages. The method you select depends on your preferences and business needs. Enable an APM-monitored app When enabling browser monitoring, you can use an APM agent to automatically inject the browser monitoring JavaScript snippet for you. This is the easiest way to install the agent for an app that's already being monitored by APM. APM-monitored apps are listed on your APM Applications index. Enable with copy/paste When enabling browser monitoring, you can manually insert the JavaScript snippet into your app's webpages. The copy/paste option gives you control over the exact placement of our JavaScript snippet, which is required to monitor the webpage's performance. This is useful for: Standalone apps, static sites, and cached pages delivered by CDN APM apps that are not as closely coupled to the browser app as with a standard server-side app (for example, when your client-side app talks to a REST API back end) Some tips for using the JavaScript snippet: Placement in your webpage: Copy the code snippet, then paste it inline into your pages as close to the top of the <head> element as possible, but after any position-sensitive <meta> tags (for example, X-UA-Compatible or charset information). For more information on the inline head placement, see JavaScript placement requirements.

Because we do not restrict the timing, you can receive first paint or first interaction data regardless of when it fires. This document describes why and how to use PageViewTiming and its attributes to query data about your site, component loading, and user performance metrics, both from visual and responsiveness standpoints. Why use PageViewTiming? If your application uses asynchronous or dynamic pages, you may need additional details about site or component loading. But pages can load content in many different ways, and users control when they interact with that content. This is why some user-centric performance metrics happen outside the standard window onload (page load time) in the browser agent. For example, users may become impatient and begin clicking as soon as content is on the webpage. Or, they may wait to use the page until long after content is loaded. The PageViewTiming event provides a more real-time delivery mechanism that does not have a dependency on any other event. The additional metrics can help you understand how users experience your site, both from visual and responsiveness standpoints. Support for Google's Core Web Vitals We now, with the release of agent version 1177, have full support for Google's Core Web Vitals for 2020. The metrics that make up Core Web Vitals will evolve over time. The current set for 2020 focuses on three aspects of the user experience—loading, interactivity, and visual stability—and includes the following metrics (and their respective thresholds): Core Web Vitals metrics include loading, interactivity, and visual stability. Largest Contentful Paint (LCP): measures loading performance. To provide a good user experience, LCP should occur within 2.5 seconds of when the page first starts loading. First Input Delay (FID): measures interactivity. To provide a good user experience, pages should have a FID of less than 100 milliseconds. Cumulative Layout Shift (CLS): measures visual stability. To provide a good user experience, pages should maintain a CLS of less than 0.1. For each of the above metrics, to ensure you're hitting the recommended target for most of your users, a good threshold to measure is the 75th percentile of page loads, segmented across mobile and desktop devices. To learn more, watch our Nerd Days talk on perceived performance. Detailed visual, interactivity, and responsiveness metrics The BrowserInteraction and PageView events end their reporting when they receive the page window load (or window load and AJAX) timing. However, paint and interactivity metrics can happen at any time. PageViewTiming delivers these metrics as a separate event to: Account for the variability in this timing. Avoid setting an arbitrary timeout. Prevent holding BrowserInteraction and PageView events indefinitely. Additional data Comments firstPaint and firstContentfulPaint The firstPaint and firstContentfulPaint attributes already are available with BrowserInteraction and PageView events. However, they are not always reliably captured before the window onload event fires. Using PageViewTiming gives you a way to capture these metrics even if they happen after the original page load time. This gives you a better understanding of the correlation between responsiveness of that load event and the visual rendering of your content. largestContentfulPaint This new metric, available with agent version 1163, largestContentfulPaint, reports the render time of the largest content element visible in the viewport. Google's research found looking at when the largest element was rendered was a more accurate way to measure when the main content of a page is loaded and useful. Details on this metric, including limitations and considerations can be found in the w3c draft. In addition, we now report the cumulative layout shift (CLS) score attribute with LCP. This attribute is reported as cumulativeLayoutShift. Largest Contentful Paint is one of three metrics identified by Google as the Core Web Vitals. LCP values up to 2.5 secs are considered \"Good\", between 2.5-4.0 secs considered \"Needs Improvement\", and above 4.0 secs considered \"Poor.\" firstInteraction and firstInputDelay With the addition of firstInteraction and firstInputDelay, you can quickly determine the ways that your users are interacting with that visual content. These metrics tell you not only when they interacted, but what type of interaction (mousedown, pointerdown, etc.) and how long it took for them to receive a response from your site. The firstInputDelay metric lies in the middle of FirstContentfulPaint and Time to Interactive (TTI) metrics, measuring the time between when a first input can be made and when the browser's main thread is able to respond to any interactions. In addition, we now report the cumulative layout shift (CLS) score attribute at the moment of the user's first interaction. This attribute is reported as cumulativeLayoutShift. First Input Delay is one of three metrics identified by Google as the Core Web Vitals. FID values up to 100 ms are considered \"Good\", between 100-300 ms considered \"Needs Improvement\", and above 300 ms considered \"Poor.\" For a more detailed explanation, see the Browser release notes. cumulativeLayoutShift Cumulative Layout Shift (CLS), available with agent v1177, is an important, user-centric metric for measuring visual stability because it helps quantify how often users experience unexpected layout shifts—a low CLS helps ensure that the page is delightful. This is one of three metrics identified by Google as the Core Web Vitals. Cumulative Layout Shift is one of three metrics identified by Google as the Core Web Vitals. CLS scores up to 0.1 are considered \"Good\", between 0.1-0.25 considered \"Needs Improvement\", and above 0.25 considered \"Poor.\" timingName You can review different types of activities with the timingName attribute, such as firstPaint, firstContentfulPaint, firstInteraction, largestContentfulPaint, pageHide and windowUnload. For example, a PageViewTiming event may have a timingName of firstPaint and a firstPaint value of .03. The event will also include all default attributes included with the standard BrowserInteraction and PageView events. elementId This is the Id, if specified, of the largestContentfulPaint element. This value will only be reported with the LCP metric. This value can be null. elementSize This is the reported size of the largestContentfulPaint element. This value will only be reported with the LCP metric. pageHide The pageHide event, available with agent v1177, is sent when the browser hides the current page in the process of presenting a different page from the session's history. For example, when the user clicks the browser's Back button, the current page receives a pageHide event before the previous page is shown. Supporting documentation and browser compatibility for the pageHide event can be found in MDN docs. In addition, we now report the cumulative layout shift (CLS) score attribute with pageHide. This attribute is reported as cumulativeLayoutShift. windowLoad The windowLoad event, available with agent v1177, is fired when the whole page has loaded, including all dependent resources such as stylesheets and images. Supporting documentation and browser compatibility for the Window Load event can be found in MDN docs. In addition, we now report the cumulative layout shift (CLS) score attribute with windowLoad. This attribute is reported as cumulativeLayoutShift. windowUnload The windowUnload event, available with agent v1163, is fired when a document or child resource is being unloaded. Supporting documentation and browser compatibility for the Window Unload event can be found in MDN docs. In addition, we now report the cumulative layout shift (CLS) score attribute with windowUnload. This attribute is reported as cumulativeLayoutShift. Compatibility and requirements Requirements: Meets install requirements Reporting of this event requires browser agent version 1153 or higher and a Pro or Pro+SPA agent. Follow our Browser agent release notes to find out when new metrics are released. These metrics are supported by the following browser versions. For unsupported browsers, no PageViewTiming events will be recorded.

If a user navigates from a site without page load timing to a site with page load timing (for example, to the first page on your page load timing-enabled site), special considerations for navigation start time arise. Contents Network estimate The page load timing JavaScript utility file creates a cookie with the navigation start time when a user leaves a page (by hooking an event, beforeunload, or pagehide, depending on the browser). However, when navigating away from a site without page load timing enabled, the JavaScript code will not be present, and the cookie will not be created. Then, when the user hits the first page of a site, the navigation start time cannot be determined, because there is no cookie. In this case the browser agent has all the data (queue time, app time, DOM content and rendering time) except network time. Navigation start time is required to compute network time. Rather than toss the data, the page load timing feature estimates the network time based on recently accumulated averages for your application, regionally. This way the page load timing feature provides a more accurate throughput measurement, and the rest of the data is retained. This is especially important for sites with a high bounce rate (when users visit only one page). The more visitors you have from different regions, the more accurate the network estimate will be. Network estimate unavailable If a network estimate is not available for your application and for the region where the hit originated, the page load timing process reverts to a network estimate across all reporting apps for the region. Failing that, the data is tossed. Note: For browsers that have the Navigation Timing API, this is not an issue, as the navigation start time can be determined without using a cookie.

      "body": "This document explains: How a web page loads How browser monitoring measures page load timing, also known as real user monitoring (RUM) Tip This is a description of traditional, synchronous page load timing. Browser can also monitor asynchronous page load timing. Page load process Here are the major steps in the loading of most web pages. The numbers 1-6 in the diagram correspond to the numbered steps below. Page load timeline: The steps involved in a web page load. Browser monitoring charts display the following segments of that process: Network, Web application, DOM processing, and Page rendering. A page load begins when a user selects a hyperlink, submits a form, or types a URL in a browser. This is also referred to as the initial request or the navigation start. The user's action sends a request across the network to the web application server. The request reaches the application for processing. (The request may take some time to start being processed. This could be the result of request queuing or it could be other factors.) The app finishes processing and sends an HTML response back across the network to the user's browser. This is sometimes referred to as response start or first byte. The user's browser receives the HTML response and starts to process the Document Object Model, or DOM. The DOM finishes loading; this point is known as DOM ready. Using the DOM, the user's browser starts to render the page. The page finishes rendering in the user's browser and the window load event fires. (For pages that use asynchronous loading, some elements may continue to load after the window load event occurs.) Page load time charts in browser monitoring Browser monitoring captures the major page load timing segments in the browser Summary page and the Page views page. If you have SPA monitoring enabled, you will have access to both this chart and SPA-specific charts. The charts show: Network Web application time DOM processing Page rendering Other segments as applicable, such as request queuing The chart colors match the colors in the page load timing diagram. one.newrelic.com > Browser > (select an app) > Summary: The load time chart appears on the Summary and Page views page. The way browser collects these times depends on the browser's capability to use the Navigation Timing Specification API. You can add custom page load timing events with the browser agent API. Here are descriptions of the activity included in the browser load time chart segments: Web application The web application time includes the time spent on the application server. This can only be determined if the browser instrumentation for page load timing was provided by an APM agent. Network The Network layer includes time spent in redirects as well as in requesting and receiving HTML. It does not include time on the server or for static assets. Network time measurement starts from the initial click on a link. Network time includes DNS and may include more than one lookup if you have redirects on your site, TCP (including the firewall, unless you have configured request queue time monitoring), and SSL connect time. If you have configured request queue time monitoring, then the network time does not include any of the request queue time that occurs after the X-Request header. If you have not configured request queue time monitoring, then the network time does include all of the request queue time. The Navigation Timing Specification API provides a detailed breakdown of network time. (For old browsers, the timer starts on the \"before unload event.\") For apps that have been deployed using the copy/paste method, Browser includes web app and queue time in Network time. This is because browser relies on the server-side agent to pass the application values to the browser agent through auto-injection. For more information about how this back-end time breaks down from the browser's point of view, use the Session traces page. The session traces report on all the network related events available, so you can see on a case-by-case basis how the browser is spending time on DNS lookups and other network events. Important Even with request queuing configured, the front-end server's setup can still affect network time. This is because the front-end server does not add the queueing time header until after it actually accepts and processes the request. If the front-end server is configured in some way that causes requests to start backlogging and to queue up in the listener socket that the front-end server uses to accept connections, then you will see network time increase for browser monitoring. The queueing time headers can never account for backlog in this listener socket. DOM processing DOM processing is the time it takes to parse the HTML into a DOM and retrieve or execute synchronous scripts. If the browser starts to download images in this phase, page load timing will capture the image load time. The DOM processing and page rendering layers include network time for static assets (assets that are not explicitly retrieved after page load). However, if a script on the page dynamically inserts image tags and loads images after the server or content delivery system (CDN) finishes, page load timing cannot capture the image load time. Page rendering The Page rendering phase is the time between the DOM being complete and the window load event. This phase measures browser-side processing of the page content, and often includes time for scripts and static assets to load. Request queuing Request queuing will be displayed in the load time chart if your account has both browser and APM linked. In New Relic, request queuing refers to the time between a request entering your production systems and it reaching your application. Depending on the specifics of your production infrastructure, this time may include an actual queue that requests enter, or it may represent other functions that take time (such as load balancing or internal network latency). App server requests vs. browser transactions Often the number of app server transactions (requests per minute or rpm) is larger than the number of browser transactions (pages per minute or ppm) for the same application. For more information, see the troubleshooting procedures. Outliers No matter how well your application performs, there will be some slow browsers, platforms, and networks that make your overall aggregate response times appear slower. To minimize the skew caused by outliers, page load timing clamps and scales the end user response times that are greater than 4.5 times your application's browser Apdex T setting to 4.5 times the Apdex T, or to 13.5 seconds, whichever is greater. (Histogram outliers are cut off at 95%.) For example, if your application's end user Apdex T threshold is 8 seconds, those response times will be clamped at 36 seconds. This minimizes the impact of these response times on your overall application but still provides accounting for \"frustrated\" Apdex scores. For SPA monitoring, outliers are handled differently. When the duration of an initial page load or route change reaches 30 minutes, that event is treated as invalid data and is discarded.",

Why use PageViewTiming? If your application uses asynchronous or dynamic pages, you may need additional details about site or component loading. But pages can load content in many different ways, and users control when they interact with that content. This is why some user-centric performance metrics happen outside the standard window onload (page load time) in the browser agent.

The current set for 2020 focuses on three aspects of the user experience—loading, interactivity, and visual stability—and includes the following metrics (and their respective thresholds): Core Web Vitals metrics include loading, interactivity, and visual stability. Largest Contentful Paint (LCP): measures loading performance. To provide a good user experience, LCP should occur within 2.5 seconds of when the page first starts loading. First Input Delay (FID): measures interactivity. To provide a good user experience, pages should have a FID of less than 100 milliseconds. Cumulative Layout Shift (CLS): measures visual stability. To provide a good user experience, pages should maintain a CLS of less than 0.1. For each of the above metrics, to ensure you're hitting the recommended target for most of your users, a good threshold to measure is the 75th percentile of page loads, segmented across mobile and desktop devices. To learn more, watch our Nerd Days talk on perceived performance. Detailed visual, interactivity, and responsiveness metrics The BrowserInteraction and PageView events end their reporting when they receive the page window load (or window load and AJAX) timing. However, paint and interactivity metrics can happen at any time. PageViewTiming delivers these metrics as a separate event to: Account for the variability in this timing. Avoid setting an arbitrary timeout. Prevent holding BrowserInteraction and PageView events indefinitely. Additional data Comments firstPaint and firstContentfulPaint The firstPaint and firstContentfulPaint attributes already are available with BrowserInteraction and PageView events. However, they are not always reliably captured before the window onload event fires. Using PageViewTiming gives you a way to capture these metrics even if they happen after the original page load time. This gives you a better understanding of the correlation between responsiveness of that load event and the visual rendering of your content. largestContentfulPaint This new metric, available with agent version 1163, largestContentfulPaint, reports the render time of the largest content element visible in the viewport. Google's research found looking at when the largest element was rendered was a more accurate way to measure when the main content of a page is loaded and useful. Details on this metric, including limitations and considerations can be found in the w3c draft. In addition, we now report the cumulative layout shift (CLS) score attribute with LCP. This attribute is reported as cumulativeLayoutShift. Largest Contentful Paint is one of three metrics identified by Google as the Core Web Vitals. LCP values up to 2.5 secs are considered \"Good\", between 2.5-4.0 secs considered \"Needs Improvement\", and above 4.0 secs considered \"Poor.\" firstInteraction and firstInputDelay With the addition of firstInteraction and firstInputDelay, you can quickly determine the ways that your users are interacting with that visual content. These metrics tell you not only when they interacted, but what type of interaction (mousedown, pointerdown, etc.) and how long it took for them to receive a response from your site. The firstInputDelay metric lies in the middle of FirstContentfulPaint and Time to Interactive (TTI) metrics, measuring the time between when a first input can be made and when the browser's main thread is able to respond to any interactions. In addition, we now report the cumulative layout shift (CLS) score attribute at the moment of the user's first interaction. This attribute is reported as cumulativeLayoutShift. First Input Delay is one of three metrics identified by Google as the Core Web Vitals. FID values up to 100 ms are considered \"Good\", between 100-300 ms considered \"Needs Improvement\", and above 300 ms considered \"Poor.\" For a more detailed explanation, see the Browser release notes. cumulativeLayoutShift Cumulative Layout Shift (CLS), available with agent v1177, is an important, user-centric metric for measuring visual stability because it helps quantify how often users experience unexpected layout shifts—a low CLS helps ensure that the page is delightful. This is one of three metrics identified by Google as the Core Web Vitals. Cumulative Layout Shift is one of three metrics identified by Google as the Core Web Vitals. CLS scores up to 0.1 are considered \"Good\", between 0.1-0.25 considered \"Needs Improvement\", and above 0.25 considered \"Poor.\" timingName You can review different types of activities with the timingName attribute, such as firstPaint, firstContentfulPaint, firstInteraction, largestContentfulPaint, pageHide and windowUnload. For example, a PageViewTiming event may have a timingName of firstPaint and a firstPaint value of .03. The event will also include all default attributes included with the standard BrowserInteraction and PageView events. elementId This is the Id, if specified, of the largestContentfulPaint element. This value will only be reported with the LCP metric. This value can be null. elementSize This is the reported size of the largestContentfulPaint element. This value will only be reported with the LCP metric. pageHide The pageHide event, available with agent v1177, is sent when the browser hides the current page in the process of presenting a different page from the session's history. For example, when the user clicks the browser's Back button, the current page receives a pageHide event before the previous page is shown. Supporting documentation and browser compatibility for the pageHide event can be found in MDN docs. In addition, we now report the cumulative layout shift (CLS) score attribute with pageHide. This attribute is reported as cumulativeLayoutShift. windowLoad The windowLoad event, available with agent v1177, is fired when the whole page has loaded, including all dependent resources such as stylesheets and images. Supporting documentation and browser compatibility for the Window Load event can be found in MDN docs. In addition, we now report the cumulative layout shift (CLS) score attribute with windowLoad. This attribute is reported as cumulativeLayoutShift. windowUnload The windowUnload event, available with agent v1163, is fired when a document or child resource is being unloaded. Supporting documentation and browser compatibility for the Window Unload event can be found in MDN docs. In addition, we now report the cumulative layout shift (CLS) score attribute with windowUnload. This attribute is reported as cumulativeLayoutShift. Compatibility and requirements Requirements: Meets install requirements Reporting of this event requires browser agent version 1153 or higher and a Pro or Pro+SPA agent. Follow our Browser agent release notes to find out when new metrics are released. These metrics are supported by the following browser versions.

If a user navigates from a site without page load timing to a site with page load timing (for example, to the first page on your page load timing-enabled site), special considerations for navigation start time arise. Contents Network estimate The page load timing JavaScript utility file creates a cookie with the navigation start time when a user leaves a page (by hooking an event, beforeunload, or pagehide, depending on the browser). However, when navigating away from a site without page load timing enabled, the JavaScript code will not be present, and the cookie will not be created. Then, when the user hits the first page of a site, the navigation start time cannot be determined, because there is no cookie. In this case the browser agent has all the data (queue time, app time, DOM content and rendering time) except network time. Navigation start time is required to compute network time. Rather than toss the data, the page load timing feature estimates the network time based on recently accumulated averages for your application, regionally. This way the page load timing feature provides a more accurate throughput measurement, and the rest of the data is retained. This is especially important for sites with a high bounce rate (when users visit only one page). The more visitors you have from different regions, the more accurate the network estimate will be. Network estimate unavailable If a network estimate is not available for your application and for the region where the hit originated, the page load timing process reverts to a network estimate across all reporting apps for the region. Failing that, the data is tossed. Note: For browsers that have the Navigation Timing API, this is not an issue, as the navigation start time can be determined without using a cookie.

      "body": "This document explains: How a web page loads How browser monitoring measures page load timing, also known as real user monitoring (RUM) Tip This is a description of traditional, synchronous page load timing. Browser can also monitor asynchronous page load timing. Page load process Here are the major steps in the loading of most web pages. The numbers 1-6 in the diagram correspond to the numbered steps below. Page load timeline: The steps involved in a web page load. Browser monitoring charts display the following segments of that process: Network, Web application, DOM processing, and Page rendering. A page load begins when a user selects a hyperlink, submits a form, or types a URL in a browser. This is also referred to as the initial request or the navigation start. The user's action sends a request across the network to the web application server. The request reaches the application for processing. (The request may take some time to start being processed. This could be the result of request queuing or it could be other factors.) The app finishes processing and sends an HTML response back across the network to the user's browser. This is sometimes referred to as response start or first byte. The user's browser receives the HTML response and starts to process the Document Object Model, or DOM. The DOM finishes loading; this point is known as DOM ready. Using the DOM, the user's browser starts to render the page. The page finishes rendering in the user's browser and the window load event fires. (For pages that use asynchronous loading, some elements may continue to load after the window load event occurs.) Page load time charts in browser monitoring Browser monitoring captures the major page load timing segments in the browser Summary page and the Page views page. If you have SPA monitoring enabled, you will have access to both this chart and SPA-specific charts. The charts show: Network Web application time DOM processing Page rendering Other segments as applicable, such as request queuing The chart colors match the colors in the page load timing diagram. one.newrelic.com > Browser > (select an app) > Summary: The load time chart appears on the Summary and Page views page. The way browser collects these times depends on the browser's capability to use the Navigation Timing Specification API. You can add custom page load timing events with the browser agent API. Here are descriptions of the activity included in the browser load time chart segments: Web application The web application time includes the time spent on the application server. This can only be determined if the browser instrumentation for page load timing was provided by an APM agent. Network The Network layer includes time spent in redirects as well as in requesting and receiving HTML. It does not include time on the server or for static assets. Network time measurement starts from the initial click on a link. Network time includes DNS and may include more than one lookup if you have redirects on your site, TCP (including the firewall, unless you have configured request queue time monitoring), and SSL connect time. If you have configured request queue time monitoring, then the network time does not include any of the request queue time that occurs after the X-Request header. If you have not configured request queue time monitoring, then the network time does include all of the request queue time. The Navigation Timing Specification API provides a detailed breakdown of network time. (For old browsers, the timer starts on the \"before unload event.\") For apps that have been deployed using the copy/paste method, Browser includes web app and queue time in Network time. This is because browser relies on the server-side agent to pass the application values to the browser agent through auto-injection. For more information about how this back-end time breaks down from the browser's point of view, use the Session traces page. The session traces report on all the network related events available, so you can see on a case-by-case basis how the browser is spending time on DNS lookups and other network events. Important Even with request queuing configured, the front-end server's setup can still affect network time. This is because the front-end server does not add the queueing time header until after it actually accepts and processes the request. If the front-end server is configured in some way that causes requests to start backlogging and to queue up in the listener socket that the front-end server uses to accept connections, then you will see network time increase for browser monitoring. The queueing time headers can never account for backlog in this listener socket. DOM processing DOM processing is the time it takes to parse the HTML into a DOM and retrieve or execute synchronous scripts. If the browser starts to download images in this phase, page load timing will capture the image load time. The DOM processing and page rendering layers include network time for static assets (assets that are not explicitly retrieved after page load). However, if a script on the page dynamically inserts image tags and loads images after the server or content delivery system (CDN) finishes, page load timing cannot capture the image load time. Page rendering The Page rendering phase is the time between the DOM being complete and the window load event. This phase measures browser-side processing of the page content, and often includes time for scripts and static assets to load. Request queuing Request queuing will be displayed in the load time chart if your account has both browser and APM linked. In New Relic, request queuing refers to the time between a request entering your production systems and it reaching your application. Depending on the specifics of your production infrastructure, this time may include an actual queue that requests enter, or it may represent other functions that take time (such as load balancing or internal network latency). App server requests vs. browser transactions Often the number of app server transactions (requests per minute or rpm) is larger than the number of browser transactions (pages per minute or ppm) for the same application. For more information, see the troubleshooting procedures. Outliers No matter how well your application performs, there will be some slow browsers, platforms, and networks that make your overall aggregate response times appear slower. To minimize the skew caused by outliers, page load timing clamps and scales the end user response times that are greater than 4.5 times your application's browser Apdex T setting to 4.5 times the Apdex T, or to 13.5 seconds, whichever is greater. (Histogram outliers are cut off at 95%.) For example, if your application's end user Apdex T threshold is 8 seconds, those response times will be clamped at 36 seconds. This minimizes the impact of these response times on your overall application but still provides accounting for \"frustrated\" Apdex scores. For SPA monitoring, outliers are handled differently. When the duration of an initial page load or route change reaches 30 minutes, that event is treated as invalid data and is discarded.",

      "body": "Browser monitoring's PageViewTiming event sends each data point as a separate event as soon as it is available. Because we do not restrict the timing, you can receive first paint or first interaction data regardless of when it fires. This document describes why and how to use PageViewTiming and its attributes to query data about your site, component loading, and user performance metrics, both from visual and responsiveness standpoints. Why use PageViewTiming? If your application uses asynchronous or dynamic pages, you may need additional details about site or component loading. But pages can load content in many different ways, and users control when they interact with that content. This is why some user-centric performance metrics happen outside the standard window onload (page load time) in the browser agent. For example, users may become impatient and begin clicking as soon as content is on the webpage. Or, they may wait to use the page until long after content is loaded. The PageViewTiming event provides a more real-time delivery mechanism that does not have a dependency on any other event. The additional metrics can help you understand how users experience your site, both from visual and responsiveness standpoints. Support for Google's Core Web Vitals We now, with the release of agent version 1177, have full support for Google's Core Web Vitals for 2020. The metrics that make up Core Web Vitals will evolve over time. The current set for 2020 focuses on three aspects of the user experience—loading, interactivity, and visual stability—and includes the following metrics (and their respective thresholds): Core Web Vitals metrics include loading, interactivity, and visual stability. Largest Contentful Paint (LCP): measures loading performance. To provide a good user experience, LCP should occur within 2.5 seconds of when the page first starts loading. First Input Delay (FID): measures interactivity. To provide a good user experience, pages should have a FID of less than 100 milliseconds. Cumulative Layout Shift (CLS): measures visual stability. To provide a good user experience, pages should maintain a CLS of less than 0.1. For each of the above metrics, to ensure you're hitting the recommended target for most of your users, a good threshold to measure is the 75th percentile of page loads, segmented across mobile and desktop devices. To learn more, watch our Nerd Days talk on perceived performance. Detailed visual, interactivity, and responsiveness metrics The BrowserInteraction and PageView events end their reporting when they receive the page window load (or window load and AJAX) timing. However, paint and interactivity metrics can happen at any time. PageViewTiming delivers these metrics as a separate event to: Account for the variability in this timing. Avoid setting an arbitrary timeout. Prevent holding BrowserInteraction and PageView events indefinitely. Additional data Comments firstPaint and firstContentfulPaint The firstPaint and firstContentfulPaint attributes already are available with BrowserInteraction and PageView events. However, they are not always reliably captured before the window onload event fires. Using PageViewTiming gives you a way to capture these metrics even if they happen after the original page load time. This gives you a better understanding of the correlation between responsiveness of that load event and the visual rendering of your content. largestContentfulPaint This new metric, available with agent version 1163, largestContentfulPaint, reports the render time of the largest content element visible in the viewport. Google's research found looking at when the largest element was rendered was a more accurate way to measure when the main content of a page is loaded and useful. Details on this metric, including limitations and considerations can be found in the w3c draft. In addition, we now report the cumulative layout shift (CLS) score attribute with LCP. This attribute is reported as cumulativeLayoutShift. Largest Contentful Paint is one of three metrics identified by Google as the Core Web Vitals. LCP values up to 2.5 secs are considered \"Good\", between 2.5-4.0 secs considered \"Needs Improvement\", and above 4.0 secs considered \"Poor.\" firstInteraction and firstInputDelay With the addition of firstInteraction and firstInputDelay, you can quickly determine the ways that your users are interacting with that visual content. These metrics tell you not only when they interacted, but what type of interaction (mousedown, pointerdown, etc.) and how long it took for them to receive a response from your site. The firstInputDelay metric lies in the middle of FirstContentfulPaint and Time to Interactive (TTI) metrics, measuring the time between when a first input can be made and when the browser's main thread is able to respond to any interactions. In addition, we now report the cumulative layout shift (CLS) score attribute at the moment of the user's first interaction. This attribute is reported as cumulativeLayoutShift. First Input Delay is one of three metrics identified by Google as the Core Web Vitals. FID values up to 100 ms are considered \"Good\", between 100-300 ms considered \"Needs Improvement\", and above 300 ms considered \"Poor.\" For a more detailed explanation, see the Browser release notes. cumulativeLayoutShift Cumulative Layout Shift (CLS), available with agent v1177, is an important, user-centric metric for measuring visual stability because it helps quantify how often users experience unexpected layout shifts—a low CLS helps ensure that the page is delightful. This is one of three metrics identified by Google as the Core Web Vitals. Cumulative Layout Shift is one of three metrics identified by Google as the Core Web Vitals. CLS scores up to 0.1 are considered \"Good\", between 0.1-0.25 considered \"Needs Improvement\", and above 0.25 considered \"Poor.\" timingName You can review different types of activities with the timingName attribute, such as firstPaint, firstContentfulPaint, firstInteraction, largestContentfulPaint, pageHide and windowUnload. For example, a PageViewTiming event may have a timingName of firstPaint and a firstPaint value of .03. The event will also include all default attributes included with the standard BrowserInteraction and PageView events. elementId This is the Id, if specified, of the largestContentfulPaint element. This value will only be reported with the LCP metric. This value can be null. elementSize This is the reported size of the largestContentfulPaint element. This value will only be reported with the LCP metric. pageHide The pageHide event, available with agent v1177, is sent when the browser hides the current page in the process of presenting a different page from the session's history. For example, when the user clicks the browser's Back button, the current page receives a pageHide event before the previous page is shown. Supporting documentation and browser compatibility for the pageHide event can be found in MDN docs. In addition, we now report the cumulative layout shift (CLS) score attribute with pageHide. This attribute is reported as cumulativeLayoutShift. windowLoad The windowLoad event, available with agent v1177, is fired when the whole page has loaded, including all dependent resources such as stylesheets and images. Supporting documentation and browser compatibility for the Window Load event can be found in MDN docs. In addition, we now report the cumulative layout shift (CLS) score attribute with windowLoad. This attribute is reported as cumulativeLayoutShift. windowUnload The windowUnload event, available with agent v1163, is fired when a document or child resource is being unloaded. Supporting documentation and browser compatibility for the Window Unload event can be found in MDN docs. In addition, we now report the cumulative layout shift (CLS) score attribute with windowUnload. This attribute is reported as cumulativeLayoutShift. Compatibility and requirements Requirements: Meets install requirements Reporting of this event requires browser agent version 1153 or higher and a Pro or Pro+SPA agent. Follow our Browser agent release notes to find out when new metrics are released. These metrics are supported by the following browser versions. For unsupported browsers, no PageViewTiming events will be recorded.

      "body": "This document explains: How a web page loads How browser monitoring measures page load timing, also known as real user monitoring (RUM) Tip This is a description of traditional, synchronous page load timing. Browser can also monitor asynchronous page load timing. Page load process Here are the major steps in the loading of most web pages. The numbers 1-6 in the diagram correspond to the numbered steps below. Page load timeline: The steps involved in a web page load. Browser monitoring charts display the following segments of that process: Network, Web application, DOM processing, and Page rendering. A page load begins when a user selects a hyperlink, submits a form, or types a URL in a browser. This is also referred to as the initial request or the navigation start. The user's action sends a request across the network to the web application server. The request reaches the application for processing. (The request may take some time to start being processed. This could be the result of request queuing or it could be other factors.) The app finishes processing and sends an HTML response back across the network to the user's browser. This is sometimes referred to as response start or first byte. The user's browser receives the HTML response and starts to process the Document Object Model, or DOM. The DOM finishes loading; this point is known as DOM ready. Using the DOM, the user's browser starts to render the page. The page finishes rendering in the user's browser and the window load event fires. (For pages that use asynchronous loading, some elements may continue to load after the window load event occurs.) Page load time charts in browser monitoring Browser monitoring captures the major page load timing segments in the browser Summary page and the Page views page. If you have SPA monitoring enabled, you will have access to both this chart and SPA-specific charts. The charts show: Network Web application time DOM processing Page rendering Other segments as applicable, such as request queuing The chart colors match the colors in the page load timing diagram. one.newrelic.com > Browser > (select an app) > Summary: The load time chart appears on the Summary and Page views page. The way browser collects these times depends on the browser's capability to use the Navigation Timing Specification API. You can add custom page load timing events with the browser agent API. Here are descriptions of the activity included in the browser load time chart segments: Web application The web application time includes the time spent on the application server. This can only be determined if the browser instrumentation for page load timing was provided by an APM agent. Network The Network layer includes time spent in redirects as well as in requesting and receiving HTML. It does not include time on the server or for static assets. Network time measurement starts from the initial click on a link. Network time includes DNS and may include more than one lookup if you have redirects on your site, TCP (including the firewall, unless you have configured request queue time monitoring), and SSL connect time. If you have configured request queue time monitoring, then the network time does not include any of the request queue time that occurs after the X-Request header. If you have not configured request queue time monitoring, then the network time does include all of the request queue time. The Navigation Timing Specification API provides a detailed breakdown of network time. (For old browsers, the timer starts on the \"before unload event.\") For apps that have been deployed using the copy/paste method, Browser includes web app and queue time in Network time. This is because browser relies on the server-side agent to pass the application values to the browser agent through auto-injection. For more information about how this back-end time breaks down from the browser's point of view, use the Session traces page. The session traces report on all the network related events available, so you can see on a case-by-case basis how the browser is spending time on DNS lookups and other network events. Important Even with request queuing configured, the front-end server's setup can still affect network time. This is because the front-end server does not add the queueing time header until after it actually accepts and processes the request. If the front-end server is configured in some way that causes requests to start backlogging and to queue up in the listener socket that the front-end server uses to accept connections, then you will see network time increase for browser monitoring. The queueing time headers can never account for backlog in this listener socket. DOM processing DOM processing is the time it takes to parse the HTML into a DOM and retrieve or execute synchronous scripts. If the browser starts to download images in this phase, page load timing will capture the image load time. The DOM processing and page rendering layers include network time for static assets (assets that are not explicitly retrieved after page load). However, if a script on the page dynamically inserts image tags and loads images after the server or content delivery system (CDN) finishes, page load timing cannot capture the image load time. Page rendering The Page rendering phase is the time between the DOM being complete and the window load event. This phase measures browser-side processing of the page content, and often includes time for scripts and static assets to load. Request queuing Request queuing will be displayed in the load time chart if your account has both browser and APM linked. In New Relic, request queuing refers to the time between a request entering your production systems and it reaching your application. Depending on the specifics of your production infrastructure, this time may include an actual queue that requests enter, or it may represent other functions that take time (such as load balancing or internal network latency). App server requests vs. browser transactions Often the number of app server transactions (requests per minute or rpm) is larger than the number of browser transactions (pages per minute or ppm) for the same application. For more information, see the troubleshooting procedures. Outliers No matter how well your application performs, there will be some slow browsers, platforms, and networks that make your overall aggregate response times appear slower. To minimize the skew caused by outliers, page load timing clamps and scales the end user response times that are greater than 4.5 times your application's browser Apdex T setting to 4.5 times the Apdex T, or to 13.5 seconds, whichever is greater. (Histogram outliers are cut off at 95%.) For example, if your application's end user Apdex T threshold is 8 seconds, those response times will be clamped at 36 seconds. This minimizes the impact of these response times on your overall application but still provides accounting for \"frustrated\" Apdex scores. For SPA monitoring, outliers are handled differently. When the duration of an initial page load or route change reaches 30 minutes, that event is treated as invalid data and is discarded.",

Contents Detecting cached pages Browser monitoring detects cached pages by comparing the total back-end time against app and queue time. When the sum of app and queue time is greater than the total back-end time, browser monitoring assumes the page was cached and aggregates the request with app and queue times as 0. Here are some additional tips for cached pages: Java: Flush the app server’s \"work\" cache. This forces the app server to recompile. .NET: Make sure your asp.net cache directory is clean by using the command flush_dotnet_temp.cmd. This forces the app server to recompile ASPs with page load timing instrumentation. Node.js: By default, Node.js does not cache pages. PHP: If you have a CDN cache your dynamic pages, make sure the cache contains the page load timing instrumentation. Python: Restart your app. Ruby: Look at the header information for automatic vs. manual instrumentation. For example, if you want to ignore specific webpages, you must disable automatic browser monitoring from the user interface, and then manually instrument the webpages that you do want to be tagged.

      "body": "Browser monitoring's PageViewTiming event sends each data point as a separate event as soon as it is available. Because we do not restrict the timing, you can receive first paint or first interaction data regardless of when it fires. This document describes why and how to use PageViewTiming and its attributes to query data about your site, component loading, and user performance metrics, both from visual and responsiveness standpoints. Why use PageViewTiming? If your application uses asynchronous or dynamic pages, you may need additional details about site or component loading. But pages can load content in many different ways, and users control when they interact with that content. This is why some user-centric performance metrics happen outside the standard window onload (page load time) in the browser agent. For example, users may become impatient and begin clicking as soon as content is on the webpage. Or, they may wait to use the page until long after content is loaded. The PageViewTiming event provides a more real-time delivery mechanism that does not have a dependency on any other event. The additional metrics can help you understand how users experience your site, both from visual and responsiveness standpoints. Support for Google's Core Web Vitals We now, with the release of agent version 1177, have full support for Google's Core Web Vitals for 2020. The metrics that make up Core Web Vitals will evolve over time. The current set for 2020 focuses on three aspects of the user experience—loading, interactivity, and visual stability—and includes the following metrics (and their respective thresholds): Core Web Vitals metrics include loading, interactivity, and visual stability. Largest Contentful Paint (LCP): measures loading performance. To provide a good user experience, LCP should occur within 2.5 seconds of when the page first starts loading. First Input Delay (FID): measures interactivity. To provide a good user experience, pages should have a FID of less than 100 milliseconds. Cumulative Layout Shift (CLS): measures visual stability. To provide a good user experience, pages should maintain a CLS of less than 0.1. For each of the above metrics, to ensure you're hitting the recommended target for most of your users, a good threshold to measure is the 75th percentile of page loads, segmented across mobile and desktop devices. To learn more, watch our Nerd Days talk on perceived performance. Detailed visual, interactivity, and responsiveness metrics The BrowserInteraction and PageView events end their reporting when they receive the page window load (or window load and AJAX) timing. However, paint and interactivity metrics can happen at any time. PageViewTiming delivers these metrics as a separate event to: Account for the variability in this timing. Avoid setting an arbitrary timeout. Prevent holding BrowserInteraction and PageView events indefinitely. Additional data Comments firstPaint and firstContentfulPaint The firstPaint and firstContentfulPaint attributes already are available with BrowserInteraction and PageView events. However, they are not always reliably captured before the window onload event fires. Using PageViewTiming gives you a way to capture these metrics even if they happen after the original page load time. This gives you a better understanding of the correlation between responsiveness of that load event and the visual rendering of your content. largestContentfulPaint This new metric, available with agent version 1163, largestContentfulPaint, reports the render time of the largest content element visible in the viewport. Google's research found looking at when the largest element was rendered was a more accurate way to measure when the main content of a page is loaded and useful. Details on this metric, including limitations and considerations can be found in the w3c draft. In addition, we now report the cumulative layout shift (CLS) score attribute with LCP. This attribute is reported as cumulativeLayoutShift. Largest Contentful Paint is one of three metrics identified by Google as the Core Web Vitals. LCP values up to 2.5 secs are considered \"Good\", between 2.5-4.0 secs considered \"Needs Improvement\", and above 4.0 secs considered \"Poor.\" firstInteraction and firstInputDelay With the addition of firstInteraction and firstInputDelay, you can quickly determine the ways that your users are interacting with that visual content. These metrics tell you not only when they interacted, but what type of interaction (mousedown, pointerdown, etc.) and how long it took for them to receive a response from your site. The firstInputDelay metric lies in the middle of FirstContentfulPaint and Time to Interactive (TTI) metrics, measuring the time between when a first input can be made and when the browser's main thread is able to respond to any interactions. In addition, we now report the cumulative layout shift (CLS) score attribute at the moment of the user's first interaction. This attribute is reported as cumulativeLayoutShift. First Input Delay is one of three metrics identified by Google as the Core Web Vitals. FID values up to 100 ms are considered \"Good\", between 100-300 ms considered \"Needs Improvement\", and above 300 ms considered \"Poor.\" For a more detailed explanation, see the Browser release notes. cumulativeLayoutShift Cumulative Layout Shift (CLS), available with agent v1177, is an important, user-centric metric for measuring visual stability because it helps quantify how often users experience unexpected layout shifts—a low CLS helps ensure that the page is delightful. This is one of three metrics identified by Google as the Core Web Vitals. Cumulative Layout Shift is one of three metrics identified by Google as the Core Web Vitals. CLS scores up to 0.1 are considered \"Good\", between 0.1-0.25 considered \"Needs Improvement\", and above 0.25 considered \"Poor.\" timingName You can review different types of activities with the timingName attribute, such as firstPaint, firstContentfulPaint, firstInteraction, largestContentfulPaint, pageHide and windowUnload. For example, a PageViewTiming event may have a timingName of firstPaint and a firstPaint value of .03. The event will also include all default attributes included with the standard BrowserInteraction and PageView events. elementId This is the Id, if specified, of the largestContentfulPaint element. This value will only be reported with the LCP metric. This value can be null. elementSize This is the reported size of the largestContentfulPaint element. This value will only be reported with the LCP metric. pageHide The pageHide event, available with agent v1177, is sent when the browser hides the current page in the process of presenting a different page from the session's history. For example, when the user clicks the browser's Back button, the current page receives a pageHide event before the previous page is shown. Supporting documentation and browser compatibility for the pageHide event can be found in MDN docs. In addition, we now report the cumulative layout shift (CLS) score attribute with pageHide. This attribute is reported as cumulativeLayoutShift. windowLoad The windowLoad event, available with agent v1177, is fired when the whole page has loaded, including all dependent resources such as stylesheets and images. Supporting documentation and browser compatibility for the Window Load event can be found in MDN docs. In addition, we now report the cumulative layout shift (CLS) score attribute with windowLoad. This attribute is reported as cumulativeLayoutShift. windowUnload The windowUnload event, available with agent v1163, is fired when a document or child resource is being unloaded. Supporting documentation and browser compatibility for the Window Unload event can be found in MDN docs. In addition, we now report the cumulative layout shift (CLS) score attribute with windowUnload. This attribute is reported as cumulativeLayoutShift. Compatibility and requirements Requirements: Meets install requirements Reporting of this event requires browser agent version 1153 or higher and a Pro or Pro+SPA agent. Follow our Browser agent release notes to find out when new metrics are released. These metrics are supported by the following browser versions. For unsupported browsers, no PageViewTiming events will be recorded.

      "body": "If a browser does not use the Navigation timing API for page load timing, the browser uses a cookie to determine the navigation start time. If a user navigates from a site without page load timing to a site with page load timing (for example, to the first page on your page load timing-enabled site), special considerations for navigation start time arise. Contents Network estimate The page load timing JavaScript utility file creates a cookie with the navigation start time when a user leaves a page (by hooking an event, beforeunload, or pagehide, depending on the browser). However, when navigating away from a site without page load timing enabled, the JavaScript code will not be present, and the cookie will not be created. Then, when the user hits the first page of a site, the navigation start time cannot be determined, because there is no cookie. In this case the browser agent has all the data (queue time, app time, DOM content and rendering time) except network time. Navigation start time is required to compute network time. Rather than toss the data, the page load timing feature estimates the network time based on recently accumulated averages for your application, regionally. This way the page load timing feature provides a more accurate throughput measurement, and the rest of the data is retained.

Contents Detecting cached pages Browser monitoring detects cached pages by comparing the total back-end time against app and queue time. When the sum of app and queue time is greater than the total back-end time, browser monitoring assumes the page was cached and aggregates the request with app and queue times as 0. Here are some additional tips for cached pages: Java: Flush the app server’s \"work\" cache. This forces the app server to recompile. .NET: Make sure your asp.net cache directory is clean by using the command flush_dotnet_temp.cmd. This forces the app server to recompile ASPs with page load timing instrumentation. Node.js: By default, Node.js does not cache pages. PHP: If you have a CDN cache your dynamic pages, make sure the cache contains the page load timing instrumentation. Python: Restart your app. Ruby: Look at the header information for automatic vs. manual instrumentation. For example, if you want to ignore specific webpages, you must disable automatic browser monitoring from the user interface, and then manually instrument the webpages that you do want to be tagged.

If a user navigates from a site without page load timing to a site with page load timing (for example, to the first page on your page load timing-enabled site), special considerations for navigation start time arise. Contents Network estimate The page load timing JavaScript utility file creates a cookie with the navigation start time when a user leaves a page (by hooking an event, beforeunload, or pagehide, depending on the browser). However, when navigating away from a site without page load timing enabled, the JavaScript code will not be present, and the cookie will not be created.

In this case the browser agent has all the data (queue time, app time, DOM content and rendering time) except network time. Navigation start time is required to compute network time. Rather than toss the data, the page load timing feature estimates the network time based on recently accumulated averages for your application, regionally.

      "body": "This document explains: How a web page loads How browser monitoring measures page load timing, also known as real user monitoring (RUM) Tip This is a description of traditional, synchronous page load timing. Browser can also monitor asynchronous page load timing. Page load process Here are the major steps in the loading of most web pages. The numbers 1-6 in the diagram correspond to the numbered steps below. Page load timeline: The steps involved in a web page load. Browser monitoring charts display the following segments of that process: Network, Web application, DOM processing, and Page rendering. A page load begins when a user selects a hyperlink, submits a form, or types a URL in a browser. This is also referred to as the initial request or the navigation start. The user's action sends a request across the network to the web application server. The request reaches the application for processing. (The request may take some time to start being processed. This could be the result of request queuing or it could be other factors.) The app finishes processing and sends an HTML response back across the network to the user's browser. This is sometimes referred to as response start or first byte. The user's browser receives the HTML response and starts to process the Document Object Model, or DOM. The DOM finishes loading; this point is known as DOM ready. Using the DOM, the user's browser starts to render the page. The page finishes rendering in the user's browser and the window load event fires. (For pages that use asynchronous loading, some elements may continue to load after the window load event occurs.) Page load time charts in browser monitoring Browser monitoring captures the major page load timing segments in the browser Summary page and the Page views page. If you have SPA monitoring enabled, you will have access to both this chart and SPA-specific charts. The charts show: Network Web application time DOM processing Page rendering Other segments as applicable, such as request queuing The chart colors match the colors in the page load timing diagram. one.newrelic.com > Browser > (select an app) > Summary: The load time chart appears on the Summary and Page views page. The way browser collects these times depends on the browser's capability to use the Navigation Timing Specification API. You can add custom page load timing events with the browser agent API. Here are descriptions of the activity included in the browser load time chart segments: Web application The web application time includes the time spent on the application server. This can only be determined if the browser instrumentation for page load timing was provided by an APM agent. Network The Network layer includes time spent in redirects as well as in requesting and receiving HTML. It does not include time on the server or for static assets. Network time measurement starts from the initial click on a link. Network time includes DNS and may include more than one lookup if you have redirects on your site, TCP (including the firewall, unless you have configured request queue time monitoring), and SSL connect time. If you have configured request queue time monitoring, then the network time does not include any of the request queue time that occurs after the X-Request header. If you have not configured request queue time monitoring, then the network time does include all of the request queue time. The Navigation Timing Specification API provides a detailed breakdown of network time. (For old browsers, the timer starts on the \"before unload event.\") For apps that have been deployed using the copy/paste method, Browser includes web app and queue time in Network time. This is because browser relies on the server-side agent to pass the application values to the browser agent through auto-injection. For more information about how this back-end time breaks down from the browser's point of view, use the Session traces page. The session traces report on all the network related events available, so you can see on a case-by-case basis how the browser is spending time on DNS lookups and other network events. Important Even with request queuing configured, the front-end server's setup can still affect network time. This is because the front-end server does not add the queueing time header until after it actually accepts and processes the request. If the front-end server is configured in some way that causes requests to start backlogging and to queue up in the listener socket that the front-end server uses to accept connections, then you will see network time increase for browser monitoring. The queueing time headers can never account for backlog in this listener socket. DOM processing DOM processing is the time it takes to parse the HTML into a DOM and retrieve or execute synchronous scripts. If the browser starts to download images in this phase, page load timing will capture the image load time. The DOM processing and page rendering layers include network time for static assets (assets that are not explicitly retrieved after page load). However, if a script on the page dynamically inserts image tags and loads images after the server or content delivery system (CDN) finishes, page load timing cannot capture the image load time. Page rendering The Page rendering phase is the time between the DOM being complete and the window load event. This phase measures browser-side processing of the page content, and often includes time for scripts and static assets to load. Request queuing Request queuing will be displayed in the load time chart if your account has both browser and APM linked. In New Relic, request queuing refers to the time between a request entering your production systems and it reaching your application. Depending on the specifics of your production infrastructure, this time may include an actual queue that requests enter, or it may represent other functions that take time (such as load balancing or internal network latency). App server requests vs. browser transactions Often the number of app server transactions (requests per minute or rpm) is larger than the number of browser transactions (pages per minute or ppm) for the same application. For more information, see the troubleshooting procedures. Outliers No matter how well your application performs, there will be some slow browsers, platforms, and networks that make your overall aggregate response times appear slower. To minimize the skew caused by outliers, page load timing clamps and scales the end user response times that are greater than 4.5 times your application's browser Apdex T setting to 4.5 times the Apdex T, or to 13.5 seconds, whichever is greater. (Histogram outliers are cut off at 95%.) For example, if your application's end user Apdex T threshold is 8 seconds, those response times will be clamped at 36 seconds. This minimizes the impact of these response times on your overall application but still provides accounting for \"frustrated\" Apdex scores. For SPA monitoring, outliers are handled differently. When the duration of an initial page load or route change reaches 30 minutes, that event is treated as invalid data and is discarded.",

      "body": "Browser monitoring provides insights into how your application or site behaves when it is loaded in a web browser. Browser only records performance data, as explained in this document. It does not record any data used or stored by the monitored application unless you explicitly configure it to do so. For more information about New Relic's security measures, see our security and privacy documentation, or visit the New Relic security website. Reported data Browser reports many different types of data to help you analyze your website's performance. It only reports page view data, unless you have subscribed to Pro features. You can also enable functionality for AJAX requests, JavaScript errors, and session traces. For most data types, browser transmits the data securely using HTTPS encryption. The browser agent transmits data to New Relic's collectors by using either of the domains bam.nr-data.net or bam-cell.nr-data.net. Here is a summary of the types of data reported by browser monitoring. Page view data This data is reported once per page view and consists of: Page load timing data Name of the server-side app controller that served the page, if available (obfuscated in the page and during transmission) Additional custom parameters set by the server-side app controller, if available (obfuscated in the page and during transmission) Additional custom parameters set by the browser agent API, if set prior to page load This information appears on the Page views page. For data security reasons, browser does not record or collect URL query strings. Server-side data can only be collected when the host is also instrumented by New Relic and the browser monitoring instrumentation is injected by the agent. For more information about how we collect and present this data, see Instrumentation for page load timing. AJAX timing data When enabled, browser periodically reports AJAX timing data until the user navigates away from or closes the page. (New Relic automatically filters out all AJAX requests that take longer than two minutes.) Data includes: Hostnames, ports, and paths (but not search/query parameters) of AJAX request URLs HTTP status code of responses Byte size of request message bodies Name of the server-side app controller servicing the AJAX request and server-side timing data (obfuscated in the page and during transmission), when the browser instrumentation is injected by the New Relic agent Timing data for the AJAX transaction Timing data for the AJAX callbacks This information appears on the AJAX page. JavaScript error data When enabled, browser periodically reports data about every error that occurs on the page until the user navigates away from or closes the page. This information appears on the JavaScript errors page. For each error, the data includes: Exception class of the error Error message containing arbitrary text Stack trace of the error, which may contain function names and URLs of scripts causing the error Error messages typically do not contain any confidential or sensitive information. However, it is possible for messages to be purposefully constructed with sensitive information. Before enabling JavaScript error reporting, ensure that your website does not expose any sensitive information in error messages. Session trace data When enabled, browser periodically reports data on the details of the a single page's life cycle, including user interactions, AJAX loads, and JavaScript errors, until the user navigates away from or closes the page. New Relic automatically stops recording further data after ten minutes. Data includes: Asset load timing details User interactions such as scrolling, mousing, and clicking JavaScript error timing and other JavaScript error information Triggered Javascript events Session traces are captured randomly at a fixed rate from among the monitored page views. Session trace information appears on the Session traces page. SPA data If you use browser's single-page app (SPA) monitoring, New Relic reports the following data once per page load or route change. Browser data for page views, AJAX timing, JavaScript errors, and session traces Hash fragments associated with SPA route changes Additional custom parameters added from the SPA API When SPA monitoring has been enabled, this information appears on the Page views page. Server-side data can only be collected when the host is also instrumented by New Relic, and the browser monitoring instrumentation is injected by the agent. For more information about how we collect and present this data, see Instrumentation for page load timing. URL query strings The browser agent uses the HTTP referer attribute to track page URLs. URLs can sometimes contain potentially sensitive user-entered query data (for example, a user's name). For data security reasons, browser does not record or collect URL query strings. Visitor's IP address Browser uses the visitor's IP address to enrich data for additional visitor segmentation. Details such as the ASN and geoID are mapped to browser data from the IP address. For data security reasons, browser does not retain the visitor's IP address for reporting. The IP address is obtained in the HTTP header from the request to the New Relic collector. New Relic does not retain the visitor's IP address after the attributes have been mapped. The IP address value is overwritten within 24 hours of data being collected. Browser types Browser determines the browser type from the User-Agent header and the geographical location based on the browser's IP address. New Relic does not retain the IP address, only the country and region associated with the performance data. This information appears on the selected app's Geography page. Also, details about specific browser types appear on the selected app's Browsers page. CDN access Page load timing requires access to the content delivery network (CDN), where New Relic's utility JavaScript file (nr.js) is hosted. The domain name for the file (js-agent.newrelic.com) remains static, but the number in the path (version) may change periodically. A script tag is injected by the New Relic agent (or pasted into the webpage for standalone apps) that references the JavaScript on the CDN, which is then loaded by the browser. The loaded JavaScript collects and reports the metrics dynamically to either of the domains bam.nr-data.net or bam-cell.nr-data.net. Important If your end users are behind a firewall or proxy and do not have access to the CDN or to New Relic's networks (including bam.nr-data.net and bam-cell.nr-data.net), browser monitoring will not work. Cookies Browser monitoring creates cookies in the end user's browser. If the user has cookies disabled, page load timing (sometimes referred to as real user monitoring or RUM) will not be able to track sessions properly. Also, if the user has an older browser that does not support the Navigation Timing Specification API, page load timing will not be able to track response times as accurately. New Relic's cookies generated by browser agents older than version 995 may not contain the secure attribute. This is because page load timing data transmission in versions before version 995 use HTTP when the page is HTTP, but use HTTPS when the page is HTTPS. All browser agent versions above version 995 will always use the secure flag for cookies and transmit over HTTPS. JavaScript and AJAX data may contain more sensitive information, so they are always transmitted over HTTPS. Transmission of these cookies using HTTP or access to them from JavaScript is not a significant security risk, because the cookies are not used to make security decisions or allow access to an account. They are used only to collect performance data, with any identifiable data obfuscated. For customers subject to special guidelines for cookie collection, such as those under the EU GDPR/PECR ICO Guidelines, we now provide the option to disable cookie collection for your application. Please see our browser agent v1169 release notes for more information. Important If your site uses P3P, it must be configured to allow these cookies. JSONP requests Page load timing metrics are reported to New Relic using a Script GET, also known as a JSONP request. The Script GET returns a value that is subsequently stored in a cookie and used to trigger trace capturing.",

Have minimal impact on overall page load time and search engine optimization (SEO), including search engine ranking, indexing, crawl efficiency, or other SEO-related concerns. Contents Efficiency of inline JavaScript The most effective method for browser monitoring is to include a minimal amount of JavaScript instrumentation code inline in the head of the monitored page. This code then retrieves the remainder of the necessary code after the page finishes loading. Other browser monitoring methods include JavaScript code at the end of the page body or exclusively using an external script. However, these methods can limit visibility into the end users' experience. Impact on SEO Performance testing results indicate that using browser monitoring's JavaScript has a negligible effect on page load time. In addition, it has no negative impact on how users or search engines interact with your site. Google's consistent recommendation to website owners is to build a site that is valuable to users and accessible to search engine crawlers. Google rankings favor sites that provide the most relevant information and the best user experience. Browser monitoring can help you improve user experience by identifying performance bottlenecks, including: Slow page loads Problematic JavaScript errors Long AJAX calls Identifying Javascript errors is especially helpful because Google's bots are increasingly running the JavaScript code on websites they crawl in order to access content provided by AJAX-heavy web applications. A JavaScript error that previously was only visible to human users (for example, a broken button) could affect whether the Google bots can successfully interact with your site. We understand that SEO and traffic referred by search engines are critically important to many businesses. When used effectively, browser monitoring can even increase a site's ranking in Google and other search engines by improving performance and user experience.",

      "body": "Browser monitoring includes strict security measures to provide a robust, standalone product with browser monitoring features. Before you install the browser agent, make sure your system meets these requirements. Want to try out our browser monitoring? Create a New Relic account for free! No credit card required. Basic requirements To report data to browser, your application must at a minimum meet two basic requirements: The traffic to the application must be from clients able to load and execute browser JavaScript code and set cookies. Clients accessing the application must be able to send data to New Relic through HTTP requests. HTTPS is required for browser Pro features. Important Browsers that subscribe to a disconnect list or that use content filtering extensions such as AdBlock may not be able to send data to New Relic. For example, if you are using the Enhanced Tracking Prevention disconnect list for Mozilla Firefox 69.0 or higher, you will need to change the default configuration. Most typical browser applications meet these requirements. However, browser applications in restricted environments may have difficulty reporting data to New Relic; for example: Hybrid mobile applications Applications installed on unusual hardware, such as point-of-sale terminals or consumer appliances For more information, review the instrumentation for browser monitoring documentation, and verify end-user network access. Browser types Instrumentation is compatible with every browser type, including Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox, Microsoft Internet Explorer and Edge, and Apple Safari. The user interface is compatible with New Relic's supported browser versions. Exceptions Comments Paint timings The firstPaint and firstContentfulPaint attributes in BrowserInteraction, PageView, and PageViewTiming events are only compatible with: Chrome 60 or higher for desktop and mobile (Android webview and Chrome for Android) Opera 47 or higher for desktop Opera 44 or higher for Android mobile Samsung Internet for mobile AJAX AJAX timing features are not available with: Chrome for iPhone and iPad IE 7 and 8 PageAction events PageAction events require a browser that fully supports cross-domain XMLHttpRequests. Internet Explorer versions 9 and lower cannot record PageAction events. Learn more on querying your data. Session traces Session traces are reported only from browsers that support the Resource Timing Specification. SHA-256 New Relic can only monitor browsers that are compatible with SHA-256. APM agents You can deploy the browser agent for apps monitored by APM, or you can deploy the browser agent for your standalone apps. For more information, see the installation procedures. If you are deploying browser for an app using APM, make sure your agent supports browser monitoring: C SDK: Version 1.0.0 or higher Go: Version 2.5.0 or higher Java: Version 3.4.0 or higher .NET: Version 2.20.25.0 or higher Node.js: Version 1.4.0 or higher PHP: Version 4.4.5.35 or higher Python: Version 2.10.1.9 or higher Ruby: Version 3.7.0.177 or higher Supported frameworks The browser agent collects data on all front-end frameworks. However, the monitoring occurs on lower-level \"primitives\" that JavaScript frameworks use, so the level of detail collected by the instrumentation may vary depending on your specific framework. Exceptions Comments Zone.js If you're using AngularJS and you want to use our SPA monitoring features, note that Zone.js versions 0.6.18 to 0.6.24 are not compatible with browser. In all cases, the browser agent must be loaded before Zone.js to avoid errors. Cypress.io Browser is unable to properly instrument the open and send methods of requests when tests are run in Cypress. This will cause the following error to be thrown: Cannot set property 'status' of undefined Copy This will only affect customers running tests with the Browser agent present in their code. Production applications should not be affected. html2pdf.js This library is not compatible with our Pro+SPA agent due to the way this library wraps promises. If you're using this library, we recommend selecting the Pro agent type. Content Security Policy (CSP) considerations In order to obtain accurate browser performance metrics, browser requires the use of a small, inline JavaScript snippet. New Relic carefully reviews the inline JavaScript to prevent Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) and other potential vulnerabilities. Content Security Policy Level 2 adds restrictions to the types of JavaScript allowed, such as inline scripts. It also limits which domains can load scripts during page load. Important If your website does not allow any third-party hosted JavaScript to run, you must request a CSP exception via your organization’s standard procedures in order to install the browser monitoring agent. When requesting a CSP exception, follow your organization's standard procedures to contact your web or security team. The browser JavaScript agent requires the following CSP exceptions in order to run properly. Alternatively, you can add all of these exceptions to the fallback default-src directive (instead of script-src and connect-src). CSP exception Comments unsafe-inline Add to the script-src directive or to the fallback default-src directive. This is required because the agent is installed by including an inline script. https://js-agent.newrelic.com Add to the script-src directive or to the fallback default-src directive. This is where additional script files that the agent requires are hosted. https://bam.nr-data.net https://bam-cell.nr-data.net Important Add https://gov-bam.nr-data.net if you're using FedRAMP-compliant endpoints. Add to the script-src directive or to the fallback default-src directive. This is where the agent sends its collected data. One of the calls to this URL is a JSONP call, which means that the URL must be allowed as a script source. Add to the connect-src directive or to the fallback default-src directive. The connect-src directive affects the URLs that scripts can call (for example, using the XMLHttpRequest interface). If you have CSP restrictions specifically around this directive, then add this URL as an exception.",
