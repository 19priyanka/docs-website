      "body": "The APM Summary page provides general information about the selected app, including web transactions and non-web transactions, Apdex score, CPU usage, throughput (requests per minute or rpm), transaction times, error rate, application activity, and hosts. Tip To get a high-level overview of all your applications and services, use the New Relic explorer. View your app's summary page To reach the Summary page, go to one.newrelic.com > Explorer > Services - APM > (select an app). Use the Explorer to access all your entities, that is, anything we can identify that reports data, from applications and hosts to custom groupings of any elements. Alternatively, you can go to one.newrelic.com > APM > (select an app). For more information, see the documentation about navigating core UI components in New Relic One. View app performance Use the Summary page for a quick summary of your website's performance. Overview charts Some charts include links to APM pages where you can drill down into additional details. APM Summary chart Comments Transactions response time This stacked chart represents the response time of web transactions or non-web transactions in your app. Segments in the chart vary depending on which agent you are using. Some charts may have an independent line for response time that represents the relationship between response time and total time. Also, for your external or background services, you may see data labeled as Web external. For more information about these out-of-process services, use the Externals page. Apdex score This chart measures the performance of your app based on its Apdex T value during the selected time window. To view additional details, hover over the question icon or the chart's End user and App server lines. The End user line charts the Apdex for your browser apps, and the App server line charts the Apdex for your APM apps. Throughput This chart illustrates the requests per minute for either web transactions or non-web transactions. To change the type of transaction, select the Transaction response time chart's dropdown arrow, then select Web or Non-web. Error rate This chart shows the number of errors that have occurred in the current time window. The tooltip that appears when you hover over the Error rate chart shows the combined throughput for both web and non-web transactions. To understand how error rate is calculated, see Application error rate example. Event markers Markers on the main Summary chart indicate events and changes to the app: Black vertical bar: Apdex settings have changed. Blue vertical bar: A deployment marker has been created or another event has occurred, such as a settings change for the app. Yellow or red area: This indicates alert thresholds have been violated. To view additional information, mouse over the marker. Drill-down details Use any of New Relic's standard page functions to drill down into detailed information. Here is a summary of additional options with the APM Summary page. If you want to... Do this... Change how data appears on the main chart Select the chart title's drop-down arrow, and then select your choice of view options, including histograms or percentiles if available. View threshold levels for your app's Apdex score Mouse over the Apdex score ? icon. For non-web transactions, the Apdex chart is blank because Apdex is not applicable to this class of apps. View trends in transaction time, Apdex, and throughput Select the Compare with yesterday and last week checkbox. The checkbox is only available when viewing the Web transaction response time chart with the time picker window Ending now. The checkbox is unavailable if you are viewing histograms, percentiles, or custom dates. View app performance since the last deployment From the time picker, select Performance since the last deployment. For detailed information about all deployments, select the Deployments page. View the Transactions page Select the Transactions table's heading on the APM Summary page. Or, to view details about a specific transaction (including operations, transaction traces, and key transactions), select its name. View the Databases or External services pages Click on a related time band in the Web transactions response time chart. View the Errors page Select the Error rate chart's title on the APM Summary page. You can also view the Errors page from one.newrelic.com > (select an app) > Events > Errors. From here you can also view available error logs in context for your app. Browser monitoring data If you install the browser agent via an APM agent, you can automatically link the browser-monitored app to the APM-monitored app. Once the browser agent is set up, the APM Summary page provides summary information and direct links to detailed information on the app's corresponding browser summary page. To view chart details with browser page load time, select the main chart's Browser link. To view the Apdex score for browsers, select the Apdex chart's Browser link. Link app performance to resources The APM Summary page shows a table with averages about your app's instances on their hosts, including: Apdex Response time Throughput Error rate CPU usage Memory Tip CPU usage percentage is calculated as though the application is running on one CPU core. For more information about this calculation, see CPU usage is over 100%. Examine app performance within system context Use any of these options to examine your app's performance within the context of your system's architecture and resources, such as individual hosts: Select your choice from the table at the bottom of the APM Summary page for infrastructure. Toggle between a table view or breakout metric details. If applicable, select your choice from the drop-down at the top of the APM Summary page for servers or JVMs. Examine details within infrastructure To help you understand the full context of your app's performance within your environment, APM includes options to view performance from inside the application, as well as from outside the application with the infrastructure agent. To view detailed information from your resources' point of view, click any host link. The link takes you directly to the infrastructure Compute page. When you click, the Compute data may not immediately appear. If that happens, follow the prompt to validate your account and complete the conversion process for the infrastructure agent. If you need additional help, get support at support.newrelic.com. Troubleshoot host link To troubleshoot the host link from the APM Summary page, use these tips: Host link from APM Summary Troubleshooting tips Your infrastructure agent is not installed on the host. Follow standard procedures to install our infrastructure agent. The application is operating within a container, and your infrastructure agent is installed on the container’s host. Set the hostname for the container to be the hostname of the underlying server. Docker containers: Run your Docker container with the argument: --uts=\"host\" Copy This will cause the container to share the UTS Linux Namespace with the underlying host. However, by using this set, a privileged container could change the host's hostname. The application is running on a Windows container, and your infrastructure agent is installed on the Windows host. To get a direct link to infrastructure metric data for your application, enable process metrics in the infrastructure agent's configuration. Your infrastructure agent is installed, but it only reports the short hostname, not the long hostname. Configure your server's hostname settings so that the infrastructure agent and the APM agent return the exact same name string. If possible, do so by editing your server's fully qualified domain name (FQDN) settings. The APM and infrastructure agents both read their hostname from the operating system's FQDN settings, so setting the hostname there ensures both agents share a single hostname. For more information, see the Java agent troubleshooting example.",

      "body": "In APM, when transaction traces are collected, there may be additional Slow query data available on the Databases page. Let's look at what slow query data is, where to find it, and how to configure it. Slow query data samples When transaction traces are reported, the slow queries feature samples the slowest database queries in those traces and reports data about them on the Databases page. Slow query data can include: Duration of query segments Query/explain plans (if recognized) Host and instance level details (if supported by agent) View slow query data Tip To get a high-level overview of all your applications and services, use the New Relic Explorer. To see your slow query data: Do one of the following: New Relic Explorer: Go to one.newrelic.com > Explorer > (select an app) > Monitor > Databases. APM: Go to one.newrelic.com > APM > (select an app) > Monitor > Databases. Select a database transaction. If available, select any available slow queries listed on the page. If you do not see expected slow query data, follow the troubleshooting tips. Configuration In general, you can configure your slow query settings either of these ways: Agent configuration Server-side configuration (if available for your agent) Agent configuration gives you more options than server-side configuration does. How you choose to configure slow queries will depend on your own setup and preferences. For more information, see the documentation for the specific agent: C SDK You can report slow query traces for SQL databases only. For more information, see Instrument your application with the C SDK. Go Agent configuration options: Enable/disable: SlowQuery.Enabled Slow query threshold: SlowQuery.Threshold For other datastore config options, see Datastore tracer configuration. Java Agent configuration: Slow query threshold: explain_threshold. For other settings related to slow transactions and queries, see the Transaction tracer config options. You can also edit basic slow query settings via server-side configuration. .NET Agent configuration: Enable/disable: slowSql enabled Slow query threshold: explainThreshold For other settings related to slow transactions and queries, see the Transaction tracer config options and the Datastore tracer options. You can also edit basic slow query settings via server-side configuration. Node.js Agent configuration: Enable/disable: enabled Threshold: explain_threshold Maximum slow query samples: max_samples For other settings related to slow transactions and queries, see the Transaction tracer config options. Server-side configuration of slow query data is not possible for the Node.js agent. PHP Agent configuration: Enable/disable: slow_sql Threshold: explain_threshold For other settings related to slow transactions and queries, see the Transaction tracer config options. Server-side configuration is not possible for the PHP agent. Python Agent configuration: Slow query threshold: explain_threshold For other settings related to slow transactions and queries, see the Transaction tracer config options and the Datastore tracer options. You can also edit basic slow query settings via server-side configuration. Ruby Agent configuration: Enable/disable: slow_sql.enabled Slow query threshold: slow_sql.explain_threshold For other settings related to slow transactions and queries, see the Transaction tracer config options and the Slow SQL config options. If applicable for your application's agent language, you can also edit basic slow query settings by using server-side configuration. Slow queries metrics The slow queries list contains the following metrics: Metric Description Response time The average response time for the statements sampled. Sample count The number of slow queries identified in the sample. To view additional details, select an individual slow query: Metric Description Start time When the stack trace began collecting the data shown. Max time The maximum time for all similar query statements in the sample. Action The action or process invoking the query. Query The query that is being reported as slow. Depending on your configuration, some parts of the query may be obfuscated. Stack trace Where in the code the statement was called. For MySQL, we provide a query analysis, which explains what happened in your query and what you might do to speed it up. Other databases display an explain plan whenever possible. Troubleshooting: No slow query data If you do not see slow query data, it may be for any of these reasons: The slow query feature has been disabled. The threshold is set to too high a duration and no slow queries are being reported. The query obfuscation setting (usually record_sql or similar) may be set to Off. To solve the problem, try adjusting the configuration options.",

      "body": "APM's Transactions page helps you identify transactions that may be good candidates for fine-tuning performance problems or resolving errors. This page lists the selected app's transaction Requests, the top five transactions by percent of wall-clock time, and relevant throughputs (requests per minute or rpm). For non-web transactions (such as message processing, background tasks, and other processes and jobs that do not handle web requests), this page shows charts of CPU and memory usage. Types of transactions Tip To get a high-level overview of all your applications and services, use the New Relic Explorer. Depending on your selected application, the Transactions page may include a dropdown you can use to select from the types of transactions available. New Relic measures processing time by type of request (web transaction or non-web transaction). This may include: Web: App server requests Non-web: Other requests (operations, background tasks, etc.) The Transactions page also may include links to transaction traces and key transactions. The types of information available will depend on your selected app and the type of request (web or non-web). Wall-clock time Wall-clock time is the amount of time recorded by the clock. New Relic uses wall-clock time for all the transactions and then sums that value across all of the transactions. The host can execute requests in parallel, so you may see percentages over 100. For example, 100% would indicate that the execution time across all selected transactions is equal to the time expended when recording wall-clock time. View transactions To view information about your app's transaction requests: Do one of the following: Go to one.newrelic.com > APM > (select an app) > Monitor > Transactions. Go to one.newrelic.com > Explorer > (select an app) > Monitor > Transactions. If applicable: To change which available types of transactions appear, select the Type. Select the sort order, or keep the default. Select the type of view as a chart (default), histogram, or percentile, if available. To view additional details, use any of the transaction drill-down functions. To add a chart to a dashboard, mouse over the chart, then select the Add to a dashboard link that appears below it. If a chart's background is light red, this indicates a time period when an alert condition's Critical threshold has been violated. To view the incident details in New Relic Alerts, click the chart. For more information, see the documentation about navigating core UI components in New Relic One. Use drill-down functions Use any of New Relic's standard user interface functions to drill down into detailed information. The Transactions page has additional drill-down functions. Change the displayed transaction Type If the Type dropdown appears above list of transactions, you can select your choice of transaction type. The available types depend on what transactions your application uses. Select the type of performance measurement (Sort) The Sort dropdown above the transaction list allows you to review transactions according to different measurements. This helps you identify good candidates for performance tuning or fixing errors. You can sort by: Sort option Comments Most time consuming (default) Highest percentage of the app's total time used. This measures which transactions consumed the most time in total. This is calculated by multiplying the number of times the transaction is called by the time the transaction took to complete. A transaction could be short, but if it is frequently called, it would appear at the top of this ranking. Slowest average response time Slowest individual transactions for the time period as averaged. This measures the slowest types of transaction. A transaction could be called only a few times, but if it is one of the longest transactions to finish, it would appear at the top of this ranking. Apdex most dissatisfying Transactions with the highest percentages of user dissatisfaction levels for the response time of your web apps and services (Apdex). The dissatisfaction level is the difference between a perfect Apdex score (1.0) and your app's apdex_t (\"tolerating\") score, based on your Apdex settings. Transactions that have the highest (worst) percentages appear at the top of this ranking. Highest throughput This measures the amount of throughput, in operation requests per minute or rpm. (For web throughput, requests per minute is sometimes called pages per minute or ppm.) Transactions that have the highest number of requests per minute appear at the top of this ranking. Tip Depending on the transaction type you choose, different sort options may be available. Mouse over summary information about a transaction To quickly view key pieces of information about the transaction, mouse over its name on the list. Select detailed information about a transaction To view detailed information, select a transaction from the list, then select App performance or Historical performance. You can also view transaction traces. View transaction data in different visual formats The Transaction page's Top 5 transactions chart and a selected transaction's App performance window include options to view data as a: Chart Histogram Percentile In addition, from the Breakdown table for a selected transaction, you can select the link to show or hide all segments of the breakdown data. Show corresponding browser request data In order to view browser information, you must install the browser agent. Then, to view corresponding browser request data, use either of these options: Select the Browser drill-down link if available. Go to one.newrelic.com > Browser > (select an app) > Page views. Identify transaction segments with high call counts or time In a transaction's Breakdown table, the Avg calls (per txn) column may include colorized segment values. These indicate instrumented segments that have exceeded thresholds. Yellow: Segment time is more than 10% of total transaction time and call count is higher than 10. Red: Segment time is more than 10% of total transaction time and call count is higher than 20. Show all transactions To view all available transactions as a table, select the Show all transactions table link. From here, use any of the available options: To change the sort order, select any column header. To export the data to a file with comma-separated values, select Export as CSV. To return to the previous chart view, select Back to top transactions. CSV tables for ending now time periods are calculated at run time. They may show slightly higher values than what appears in the APM table. For each transaction, the Show all transactions table includes these measurements: Measurement Definition Apdex The average Apdex score for all transactions that occurred in the selected time range. Apdex scores marked with an * asterisk indicate the agent collected fewer than 100 samples for that transaction name. Data for these transactions may be less accurate than data for transactions with higher throughput. Count The total number of all transactions that occurred in the selected time range. Avg (ms) The average time taken by all transactions in the selected time range. SD (ms) The standard deviation of all timing measurements for all transactions in the selected time range. Min (ms) The time taken by the fastest transaction in the selected time range. Max (ms) The time taken by the slowest transaction in the selected time range. Total (ms) The total amount of time taken by all transactions that occurred in the selected time range. Total (% time) The total amount of time for all transactions of that type, expressed as a percentage of the total amount of time taken by all transactions. Dissat (%) The percentage of the transactions that did not have satisfied Apdex scores. If you view transactions as a table, the All transactions row always contributes 100% of the app's total dissatisfaction, even if no responses are dissatisfying (100% of zero is zero). In this situation, 100% does not mean that all of your transactions are dissatisfying. The sum of all the other values in the Dissat (%) column is 100%. Additional functions Here are some additional functions for the Transactions page's selected transaction. If you want to... Do this... View transactions for operations and other background tasks Change the Type to Other transactions (or a specific type listed), then select a specific transaction. The Transactions page shows the top five transactions for this selection by wall-clock time, CPU usage, and memory usage. Track a transaction that is important to your business Select the transaction's name, then select Track as key transaction. View transaction trace details A transaction trace is a complete picture of a single transaction. From the Transactions page, select the transaction trace. Select the view for Summary, Trace details, or Database queries, if available. To expand the transaction trace to full screen view, select the full screen icon. To return to the Transactions page: Next to the transaction trace's name, select the back arrow. Examine logs for trace details If you are using our logs in context feature, you can see any logs that are linked to your traces. From the Transactions page, click on a trace to go to the trace details page. From the trace details page, click See logs. To view details related to an individual log message, click directly on the message. Add or view transaction segments To add segments to a transaction, use custom instrumentation.

      "body": "The APM Summary page provides general information about the selected app, including web transactions and non-web transactions, Apdex score, CPU usage, throughput (requests per minute or rpm), transaction times, error rate, application activity, and hosts. Tip To get a high-level overview of all your applications and services, use the New Relic explorer. View your app's summary page To reach the Summary page, go to one.newrelic.com > Explorer > Services - APM > (select an app). Use the Explorer to access all your entities, that is, anything we can identify that reports data, from applications and hosts to custom groupings of any elements. Alternatively, you can go to one.newrelic.com > APM > (select an app). For more information, see the documentation about navigating core UI components in New Relic One. View app performance Use the Summary page for a quick summary of your website's performance. Overview charts Some charts include links to APM pages where you can drill down into additional details. APM Summary chart Comments Transactions response time This stacked chart represents the response time of web transactions or non-web transactions in your app. Segments in the chart vary depending on which agent you are using. Some charts may have an independent line for response time that represents the relationship between response time and total time. Also, for your external or background services, you may see data labeled as Web external. For more information about these out-of-process services, use the Externals page. Apdex score This chart measures the performance of your app based on its Apdex T value during the selected time window. To view additional details, hover over the question icon or the chart's End user and App server lines. The End user line charts the Apdex for your browser apps, and the App server line charts the Apdex for your APM apps. Throughput This chart illustrates the requests per minute for either web transactions or non-web transactions. To change the type of transaction, select the Transaction response time chart's dropdown arrow, then select Web or Non-web. Error rate This chart shows the number of errors that have occurred in the current time window. The tooltip that appears when you hover over the Error rate chart shows the combined throughput for both web and non-web transactions. To understand how error rate is calculated, see Application error rate example. Event markers Markers on the main Summary chart indicate events and changes to the app: Black vertical bar: Apdex settings have changed. Blue vertical bar: A deployment marker has been created or another event has occurred, such as a settings change for the app. Yellow or red area: This indicates alert thresholds have been violated. To view additional information, mouse over the marker. Drill-down details Use any of New Relic's standard page functions to drill down into detailed information. Here is a summary of additional options with the APM Summary page. If you want to... Do this... Change how data appears on the main chart Select the chart title's drop-down arrow, and then select your choice of view options, including histograms or percentiles if available. View threshold levels for your app's Apdex score Mouse over the Apdex score ? icon. For non-web transactions, the Apdex chart is blank because Apdex is not applicable to this class of apps. View trends in transaction time, Apdex, and throughput Select the Compare with yesterday and last week checkbox. The checkbox is only available when viewing the Web transaction response time chart with the time picker window Ending now. The checkbox is unavailable if you are viewing histograms, percentiles, or custom dates. View app performance since the last deployment From the time picker, select Performance since the last deployment. For detailed information about all deployments, select the Deployments page. View the Transactions page Select the Transactions table's heading on the APM Summary page. Or, to view details about a specific transaction (including operations, transaction traces, and key transactions), select its name. View the Databases or External services pages Click on a related time band in the Web transactions response time chart. View the Errors page Select the Error rate chart's title on the APM Summary page. You can also view the Errors page from one.newrelic.com > (select an app) > Events > Errors. From here you can also view available error logs in context for your app. Browser monitoring data If you install the browser agent via an APM agent, you can automatically link the browser-monitored app to the APM-monitored app. Once the browser agent is set up, the APM Summary page provides summary information and direct links to detailed information on the app's corresponding browser summary page. To view chart details with browser page load time, select the main chart's Browser link. To view the Apdex score for browsers, select the Apdex chart's Browser link. Link app performance to resources The APM Summary page shows a table with averages about your app's instances on their hosts, including: Apdex Response time Throughput Error rate CPU usage Memory Tip CPU usage percentage is calculated as though the application is running on one CPU core. For more information about this calculation, see CPU usage is over 100%. Examine app performance within system context Use any of these options to examine your app's performance within the context of your system's architecture and resources, such as individual hosts: Select your choice from the table at the bottom of the APM Summary page for infrastructure. Toggle between a table view or breakout metric details. If applicable, select your choice from the drop-down at the top of the APM Summary page for servers or JVMs. Examine details within infrastructure To help you understand the full context of your app's performance within your environment, APM includes options to view performance from inside the application, as well as from outside the application with the infrastructure agent. To view detailed information from your resources' point of view, click any host link. The link takes you directly to the infrastructure Compute page. When you click, the Compute data may not immediately appear. If that happens, follow the prompt to validate your account and complete the conversion process for the infrastructure agent. If you need additional help, get support at support.newrelic.com. Troubleshoot host link To troubleshoot the host link from the APM Summary page, use these tips: Host link from APM Summary Troubleshooting tips Your infrastructure agent is not installed on the host. Follow standard procedures to install our infrastructure agent. The application is operating within a container, and your infrastructure agent is installed on the container’s host. Set the hostname for the container to be the hostname of the underlying server. Docker containers: Run your Docker container with the argument: --uts=\"host\" Copy This will cause the container to share the UTS Linux Namespace with the underlying host. However, by using this set, a privileged container could change the host's hostname. The application is running on a Windows container, and your infrastructure agent is installed on the Windows host. To get a direct link to infrastructure metric data for your application, enable process metrics in the infrastructure agent's configuration. Your infrastructure agent is installed, but it only reports the short hostname, not the long hostname. Configure your server's hostname settings so that the infrastructure agent and the APM agent return the exact same name string. If possible, do so by editing your server's fully qualified domain name (FQDN) settings. The APM and infrastructure agents both read their hostname from the operating system's FQDN settings, so setting the hostname there ensures both agents share a single hostname. For more information, see the Java agent troubleshooting example.",

      "body": "APM's Transactions page helps you identify transactions that may be good candidates for fine-tuning performance problems or resolving errors. This page lists the selected app's transaction Requests, the top five transactions by percent of wall-clock time, and relevant throughputs (requests per minute or rpm). For non-web transactions (such as message processing, background tasks, and other processes and jobs that do not handle web requests), this page shows charts of CPU and memory usage. Types of transactions Tip To get a high-level overview of all your applications and services, use the New Relic Explorer. Depending on your selected application, the Transactions page may include a dropdown you can use to select from the types of transactions available. New Relic measures processing time by type of request (web transaction or non-web transaction). This may include: Web: App server requests Non-web: Other requests (operations, background tasks, etc.) The Transactions page also may include links to transaction traces and key transactions. The types of information available will depend on your selected app and the type of request (web or non-web). Wall-clock time Wall-clock time is the amount of time recorded by the clock. New Relic uses wall-clock time for all the transactions and then sums that value across all of the transactions. The host can execute requests in parallel, so you may see percentages over 100. For example, 100% would indicate that the execution time across all selected transactions is equal to the time expended when recording wall-clock time. View transactions To view information about your app's transaction requests: Do one of the following: Go to one.newrelic.com > APM > (select an app) > Monitor > Transactions. Go to one.newrelic.com > Explorer > (select an app) > Monitor > Transactions. If applicable: To change which available types of transactions appear, select the Type. Select the sort order, or keep the default. Select the type of view as a chart (default), histogram, or percentile, if available. To view additional details, use any of the transaction drill-down functions. To add a chart to a dashboard, mouse over the chart, then select the Add to a dashboard link that appears below it. If a chart's background is light red, this indicates a time period when an alert condition's Critical threshold has been violated. To view the incident details in New Relic Alerts, click the chart. For more information, see the documentation about navigating core UI components in New Relic One. Use drill-down functions Use any of New Relic's standard user interface functions to drill down into detailed information. The Transactions page has additional drill-down functions. Change the displayed transaction Type If the Type dropdown appears above list of transactions, you can select your choice of transaction type. The available types depend on what transactions your application uses. Select the type of performance measurement (Sort) The Sort dropdown above the transaction list allows you to review transactions according to different measurements. This helps you identify good candidates for performance tuning or fixing errors. You can sort by: Sort option Comments Most time consuming (default) Highest percentage of the app's total time used. This measures which transactions consumed the most time in total. This is calculated by multiplying the number of times the transaction is called by the time the transaction took to complete. A transaction could be short, but if it is frequently called, it would appear at the top of this ranking. Slowest average response time Slowest individual transactions for the time period as averaged. This measures the slowest types of transaction. A transaction could be called only a few times, but if it is one of the longest transactions to finish, it would appear at the top of this ranking. Apdex most dissatisfying Transactions with the highest percentages of user dissatisfaction levels for the response time of your web apps and services (Apdex). The dissatisfaction level is the difference between a perfect Apdex score (1.0) and your app's apdex_t (\"tolerating\") score, based on your Apdex settings. Transactions that have the highest (worst) percentages appear at the top of this ranking. Highest throughput This measures the amount of throughput, in operation requests per minute or rpm. (For web throughput, requests per minute is sometimes called pages per minute or ppm.) Transactions that have the highest number of requests per minute appear at the top of this ranking. Tip Depending on the transaction type you choose, different sort options may be available. Mouse over summary information about a transaction To quickly view key pieces of information about the transaction, mouse over its name on the list. Select detailed information about a transaction To view detailed information, select a transaction from the list, then select App performance or Historical performance. You can also view transaction traces. View transaction data in different visual formats The Transaction page's Top 5 transactions chart and a selected transaction's App performance window include options to view data as a: Chart Histogram Percentile In addition, from the Breakdown table for a selected transaction, you can select the link to show or hide all segments of the breakdown data. Show corresponding browser request data In order to view browser information, you must install the browser agent. Then, to view corresponding browser request data, use either of these options: Select the Browser drill-down link if available. Go to one.newrelic.com > Browser > (select an app) > Page views. Identify transaction segments with high call counts or time In a transaction's Breakdown table, the Avg calls (per txn) column may include colorized segment values. These indicate instrumented segments that have exceeded thresholds. Yellow: Segment time is more than 10% of total transaction time and call count is higher than 10. Red: Segment time is more than 10% of total transaction time and call count is higher than 20. Show all transactions To view all available transactions as a table, select the Show all transactions table link. From here, use any of the available options: To change the sort order, select any column header. To export the data to a file with comma-separated values, select Export as CSV. To return to the previous chart view, select Back to top transactions. CSV tables for ending now time periods are calculated at run time. They may show slightly higher values than what appears in the APM table. For each transaction, the Show all transactions table includes these measurements: Measurement Definition Apdex The average Apdex score for all transactions that occurred in the selected time range. Apdex scores marked with an * asterisk indicate the agent collected fewer than 100 samples for that transaction name. Data for these transactions may be less accurate than data for transactions with higher throughput. Count The total number of all transactions that occurred in the selected time range. Avg (ms) The average time taken by all transactions in the selected time range. SD (ms) The standard deviation of all timing measurements for all transactions in the selected time range. Min (ms) The time taken by the fastest transaction in the selected time range. Max (ms) The time taken by the slowest transaction in the selected time range. Total (ms) The total amount of time taken by all transactions that occurred in the selected time range. Total (% time) The total amount of time for all transactions of that type, expressed as a percentage of the total amount of time taken by all transactions. Dissat (%) The percentage of the transactions that did not have satisfied Apdex scores. If you view transactions as a table, the All transactions row always contributes 100% of the app's total dissatisfaction, even if no responses are dissatisfying (100% of zero is zero). In this situation, 100% does not mean that all of your transactions are dissatisfying. The sum of all the other values in the Dissat (%) column is 100%. Additional functions Here are some additional functions for the Transactions page's selected transaction. If you want to... Do this... View transactions for operations and other background tasks Change the Type to Other transactions (or a specific type listed), then select a specific transaction. The Transactions page shows the top five transactions for this selection by wall-clock time, CPU usage, and memory usage. Track a transaction that is important to your business Select the transaction's name, then select Track as key transaction. View transaction trace details A transaction trace is a complete picture of a single transaction. From the Transactions page, select the transaction trace. Select the view for Summary, Trace details, or Database queries, if available. To expand the transaction trace to full screen view, select the full screen icon. To return to the Transactions page: Next to the transaction trace's name, select the back arrow. Examine logs for trace details If you are using our logs in context feature, you can see any logs that are linked to your traces. From the Transactions page, click on a trace to go to the trace details page. From the trace details page, click See logs. To view details related to an individual log message, click directly on the message. Add or view transaction segments To add segments to a transaction, use custom instrumentation. To view the segments of a specific transaction, use transaction traces. View reports You can also use the Web transactions analysis report for web transactions and the Background jobs analysis report for non-web transactions to compare the amount of time spent in throughput, total time in the transaction, average time to execute it, and Apdex score as applicable.

Error rate This chart shows the number of errors that have occurred in the current time window. The tooltip that appears when you hover over the Error rate chart shows the combined throughput for both web and non-web transactions. To understand how error rate is calculated, see Application error rate example. Event markers Markers on the main Summary chart indicate events and changes to the app: Black vertical bar: Apdex settings have changed. Blue vertical bar: A deployment marker has been created or another event has occurred, such as a settings change for the app. Yellow or red area: This indicates alert thresholds have been violated. To view additional information, mouse over the marker. Drill-down details Use any of New Relic's standard page functions to drill down into detailed information. Here is a summary of additional options with the APM Summary page. If you want to... Do this... Change how data appears on the main chart Select the chart title's drop-down arrow, and then select your choice of view options, including histograms or percentiles if available. View threshold levels for your app's Apdex score Mouse over the Apdex score ? icon. For non-web transactions, the Apdex chart is blank because Apdex is not applicable to this class of apps. View trends in transaction time, Apdex, and throughput Select the Compare with yesterday and last week checkbox. The checkbox is only available when viewing the Web transaction response time chart with the time picker window Ending now. The checkbox is unavailable if you are viewing histograms, percentiles, or custom dates. View app performance since the last deployment From the time picker, select Performance since the last deployment. For detailed information about all deployments, select the Deployments page. View the Transactions page Select the Transactions table's heading on the APM Summary page. Or, to view details about a specific transaction (including operations, transaction traces, and key transactions), select its name. View the Databases or External services pages Click on a related time band in the Web transactions response time chart. View the Errors page Select the Error rate chart's title on the APM Summary page. You can also view the Errors page from one.newrelic.com > (select an app) > Events > Errors. From here you can also view available error logs in context for your app. Browser monitoring data If you install the browser agent via an APM agent, you can automatically link the browser-monitored app to the APM-monitored app. Once the browser agent is set up, the APM Summary page provides summary information and direct links to detailed information on the app's corresponding browser summary page. To view chart details with browser page load time, select the main chart's Browser link. To view the Apdex score for browsers, select the Apdex chart's Browser link. Link app performance to resources The APM Summary page shows a table with averages about your app's instances on their hosts, including: Apdex Response time Throughput Error rate CPU usage Memory Tip CPU usage percentage is calculated as though the application is running on one CPU core. For more information about this calculation, see CPU usage is over 100%. Examine app performance within system context Use any of these options to examine your app's performance within the context of your system's architecture and resources, such as individual hosts: Select your choice from the table at the bottom of the APM Summary page for infrastructure. Toggle between a table view or breakout metric details. If applicable, select your choice from the drop-down at the top of the APM Summary page for servers or JVMs. Examine details within infrastructure To help you understand the full context of your app's performance within your environment, APM includes options to view performance from inside the application, as well as from outside the application with the infrastructure agent. To view detailed information from your resources' point of view, click any host link. The link takes you directly to the infrastructure Compute page. When you click, the Compute data may not immediately appear. If that happens, follow the prompt to validate your account and complete the conversion process for the infrastructure agent. If you need additional help, get support at support.newrelic.com. Troubleshoot host link To troubleshoot the host link from the APM Summary page, use these tips: Host link from APM Summary Troubleshooting tips Your infrastructure agent is not installed on the host. Follow standard procedures to install our infrastructure agent. The application is operating within a container, and your infrastructure agent is installed on the container’s host. Set the hostname for the container to be the hostname of the underlying server. Docker containers: Run your Docker container with the argument: --uts=\"host\" Copy This will cause the container to share the UTS Linux Namespace with the underlying host. However, by using this set, a privileged container could change the host's hostname. The application is running on a Windows container, and your infrastructure agent is installed on the Windows host. To get a direct link to infrastructure metric data for your application, enable process metrics in the infrastructure agent's configuration. Your infrastructure agent is installed, but it only reports the short hostname, not the long hostname. Configure your server's hostname settings so that the infrastructure agent and the APM agent return the exact same name string. If possible, do so by editing your server's fully qualified domain name (FQDN) settings. The APM and infrastructure agents both read their hostname from the operating system's FQDN settings, so setting the hostname there ensures both agents share a single hostname. For more information, see the Java agent troubleshooting example.",

      "body": "The thread profiler is a low-impact profiling tool that can be used in production to identify bottlenecks in an application. It works by periodically (100ms) capturing the stack trace of each thread for a specified duration. At the end of the specified duration, the stack traces are aggregated to build a tree. The call count in the tree corresponds to the number of times that function was present in the stack traces under the same context. Although the call tree cannot capture the entire execution, a large enough sample can be a good representation of the application behavior. This provides insights into the \"hot\" functions of the app where most of the time is spent. With this scope, entries sampled less than 0.05% are omitted. Supported agents This feature is available only for specific agents and versions: Java: Agent versions 1.2.004.6 or higher .NET: Framework: Agent versions 2.12.146.0 or higher .NET Core 2.0: Agent versions 8.3.360.0 or higher (Windows only) Linux: .NET Core 3.0 or higher and agent versions 8.23 or higher Python: Agent versions 1.7.0 or higher Ruby: Agent versions 3.5.5 or higher Start the profiler The thread profiler feature is enabled by default. You also may be able to turn it on or off in your agent configuration file: Java: thread_profiler.enabled NET: You cannot disable the thread profiler with .NET apps. Python: thread_profiler.enabled Ruby: thread_profiler.enabled When enabled, you can view the thread profiler from our user interface: Go to one.newrelic.com > APM > (select an app) > Events > Thread profiler. Select the host you want to run the profiler on. Set the duration for the profiling session. Select Start profiler. This triggers the agent to start the thread profiler during the next harvest cycle (every one minute) and capture data for the specified duration. We record thread backtraces whether or not they are in a runnable state at the time the sample is taken. Threads that are sleeping or blocked on IO may appear in the call tree. one.newrelic.com > APM > (select an app) > Events > Thread profiler: Use this page to define the settings for the thread profiler duration and to view the results. View profile data After the profiler finishes running, the agent will report the profile data. The call tree automatically appears on the Thread profiler page. The percentages in the call tree represent the percentage of thread backtrace samples in which each call path appeared during the profiling session. The data collection started at the PROFILE COLLECTED time. The page color-codes the tree results: Red: Percentages greater than 30% Yellow: Percentages greater than 10% Black: Percentages less than 10% If you want to... Do this... Change how the thread profile information appears Select your choices of available options in the Tree settings, and select Refresh tree. Change how much information appears Select the Expand or Collapse options above the call tree, or select the name or arrow on any line in the call tree. View summary information about any line in the call tree Mouse over the line. Email the thread profile results to others Select Share this profile. Start another session or view a different thread profile Select Back to all profiles. Agent considerations Depending on which agent you use, the thread profiling feature has additional considerations. .NET-specific notes When using thread profiling with the .NET Framework agent, be aware of the following. .NET agent Thread profiler notes Supported on Linux Thread profiling on Linux is supported on .NET Core 3.0 or later applications when running .NET agent version 8.23 or later. Managed threads only For .NET agents, the thread profiler only captures stack traces on managed threads. It does not capture stack traces on unmanaged threads. If a call to an unmanaged function occurs on a managed thread, the thread profiler will show Native:Function Call in the call tree. No line numbers A .NET thread profile does not include line numbers in the call tree. The Show line numbers checkbox in the Tree Settings does not have any effect. Bug with 64-bit v4.0 .NET CLR There is a bug in the 64-bit version 4.0 .NET Common Language Runtime (CLR) that interferes with the agent's ability to retrieve managed stack traces. If your app experiences this bug, APM will show empty thread profiles. This bug does not affect 32-bit applications. The bug is fixed in the CLR releases for .NET 4.5. To verify whether your 64-bit application has the fixed version, look at the full version of the mscorlib.dll in the C: \\ Windows \\ Microsoft.NET \\ Framework64 \\ v4.0.30319 directory. The fix is in versions 4.0.30319.17379 or higher. Other category only All threads are put in the Other category. The Web Request and Background categories are not supported. Python-specific notes When using thread profiling with the Python agent, be aware of the following. Python agent Thread profiler notes Co-routine based systems There are limits to capturing details when a co-routine based system is being used, such as gevent or eventlet modes of gunicorn. If creating a new thread, the Python agent will actually create a greenlet instead of a thread profiler background thread. Therefore, the thread profiler will not capture any web request and background transactions on the thread profiler page. Greenlets A greenlet can run only when other greenlets explicitly yield control, such as when they block. For example, if the thread sampler does get to run, it will only sample the stack for other greenlets at a point where they are blocked. It will not sample them when they are executing arbitrary code. It can completely miss execution within a greenlet if it never blocked or otherwise yielded to another greenlet. Time in Python code Time spent in pure Python code that isn't blocking requests will not be picked up, and no information will be recorded or reported. This is because results are misleading when co-routines are used. Ruby-specific notes When using thread profiling with the Ruby agent, be aware of the following. Ruby agent Thread profiler notes Backtraces The thread profiler depends on the ability to capture thread backtraces from within your Ruby application. For this reason, it requires MRI 1.9.2 or higher (for the Thread#backtrace method). Resque The Ruby agent does not currently support thread profiles with Resque background jobs. A thread profiling session initiated against Resque will only capture traces from the parent process, not the job processes. JRuby JRuby support is considered experimental at this time. There are known issues with JRuby's Thread#backtrace implementation that will affect the accuracy of and reliability of backtraces collected under JRuby.",

      "body": "In order to report request queuing, New Relic agents depend on an HTTP header set by the front-end web server (such as Apache or Nginx) or load balancer (such as HAProxy or F5). These examples use the X-Request-Start header, since it is has broader support across platforms. If this does not work with your server configuration for request queuing, try using the X-Queue-Start header. The syntax should otherwise be the same. Apache Apache's mod_headers module includes a %t variable that is formatted correctly. To enable request queue reporting, add this code to your Apache config: RequestHeader set X-Request-Start \"%t\" Copy Nginx If you are using Nginx version 1.2.6 or higher and the latest version of the Ruby, Python, or PHP agent, Nginx can easily be configured to report queue time. (For Nginx versions 1.2.6 or lower, you must recompile Nginx with a module or patch.) Configuring with Nginx 1.2.6 or higher uses the ${msec} variable, which is a number in seconds with milliseconds resolution. For more information, see http://nginx.org/en/docs/http/ngx_http_core_module.html#variables. Add the appropriate information to your Nginx config: Nginx configuration Values General Nginx use proxy_set_header X-Request-Start \"t=${msec}\"; Copy Passenger Version 5 or higher: >passenger_set_header X-REQUEST-START \"t=${msec}\"; Copy Older versions: passenger_set_cgi_param X_REQUEST_START \"t=${msec}\"; Copy fastcgi fastcgi_param HTTP_X_REQUEST_START \"t=${msec}\"; Copy uWSGI uwsgi_param HTTP_X_REQUEST_START \"t=${msec}\"; Copy F5 load balancers For F5 load balancers, use this configuration snippet: when HTTP_REQUEST_SEND { # TCL 8.4 so we have to calculate the time in millisecond resolution # Calculation from: https://groups.google.com/forum/? fromgroups=#!topic/comp.lang.tcl/tV9H6TDv0t8 set secs [clock seconds] set ms [clock clicks -milliseconds] set base [expr { $secs * 1000 }] set fract [expr { $ms - $base }] if { $fract >= 1000 } { set diff [expr { $fract / 1000 }] incr secs $diff incr fract [expr { -1000 * $diff }] } set micros [format \"%d%03d000\" $secs $fract] # Want this header inserted as if coming from the client clientside { HTTP::header insert X-Request-Start \"t=${micros}\" } } Copy Network timing Even with request queuing configured, the front-end server's setup can still affect network time in your browser data. This is because the front-end server does not add the queuing time header until after it actually accepts and processes the request. The queuing time headers can never account for backlog in the listener socket used to accept requests. For example, if the front-end server's configuration results in a backlog of requests that queue in the listener socket, page load timing will show an increase in network time.",

Use request queuing to identify scaling problems Tracking time spent in request queuing is useful for identifying certain types of performance and scaling problems; for example: When your front-end web server is spending time waiting for application workers to become available When extra time is spent warming up application workers after a deploy or restart You must configure your New Relic agent and server to report request queuing.

      "body": "Request queuing occurs before the request reaches your application (where the agent resides). This is why you need to do some straightforward configuration of the agent and your production hosts to take advantage of this feature. HTTP header In order to report request queuing, most New Relic agents depend on an HTTP header set by the front-end web server (such as Apache or Nginx) or load balancer (such as HAProxy or F5). You can configure these front-end servers to set the timestamp in the HTTP header that represents when the request first entered your production infrastructure. Tip Set this header as soon after the request enters your infrastructure as possible so that you are less likely to miss performance problems in your infrastructure that occur before the header is set. Most New Relic agents will interpret an X-Queue-Start or X-Request-Start header and use it to calculate Request Queuing. The agents treat these headers identically. Include a value in the format t=MICROSECONDS_SINCE_EPOCH where MICROSECONDS_SINCE_EPOCH is an integer value of the number of microseconds that have elapsed since the beginning of the Unix epoch (for example, January 1, 1970). Nearly any front-end HTTP server or load balancer can be configured to add this header. Additional details depend on your specific agent and server configuration. For more information, see the request queue configuration examples. C SDK The C SDK does not support request queuing. Go agent With the Go agent, set either header to record a metric for it. Java, Node.js, Python, Ruby agents The most recent versions of the Java, Node.js, Python, and Ruby agents provide more flexibility in the format of the X-Request-Start or X-Queue-Start header. These agents allow the timestamp to be submitted in seconds, milliseconds, or microseconds as an integer or floating point value. These agents also allow the leading t= in the header value to be omitted. Based on the order of magnitude, these agents automatically interpret the time unit as seconds, milliseconds, or microseconds. New Relic can do this reliably since a millisecond timestamp, interpreted as microseconds, would result in a queue time over 40 years. Python agent only: When using Apache/mod_wsgi 3.4 or higher, mod_wsgi will automatically insert an equivalent to the X-Queue-Start header into the WSGI environ dictionary for each request. This will mark the specific point in time where Apache first accepted the request. The value set by mod_wsgi will be picked up and used by the Python agent if no separate X-Request-Start or X-Queue-Start header has been manually configured into a web server's front end or in Apache itself. .NET agent The .NET agent does not require (and will ignore) any configuration of HTTP headers to calculate queue time. It works by instrumenting the IIS-queuing mechanism directly and reports queue time as the difference between when the HttpContext constructor executes and when the HttpApplication.BeginRequest event fires. Request queue time is only reported for .NET Framework applications hosted on IIS (for example: ASP.NET applications). It is not reported for ASP .NET Core applications (targeting .NET Core or Framework), nor for self-hosted OWIN applications. PHP agent The PHP agent only supports the X-Request-Start header. This identifies the timestamp in microseconds as an integer, with an optional t= in the header value. To ensure that the header is read properly, check your phpinfo() under the PHP Variables section, and verify that _SERVER[\"HTTP_X_REQUEST_START\"] exists and is in the expected format. If you are using Nginx, see Request queue server configuration examples for additional information on setting the header.",

      "body": "If you're following the Enable distributed tracing procedures and want to set up Infinite Tracing, you'll need to set up a trace observer. A trace observer is a cloud-based New Relic tool that decides what trace data to keep and send to New Relic. The trace observer lives in New Relic Edge, which is an AWS-based service that provides you with a low-latency and low-cost way to send your telemetry data to New Relic. The trace observer sends data via our Trace API, which is the entry point for all distributed trace data we ingest. Tip This documentation is for our Infinite Tracing feature. To learn about all our distributed tracing options, see Intro to distributed tracing. Set up the trace observer Before setting up a trace observer, understand these points: With the exception of the Trace API, these instructions are not standalone; they're part of larger enable procedures. If you're still figuring out what you need, see Enable distributed tracing. To avoid configuration conflict issues, you should ideally enable Infinite Tracing for all associated services. If some services in a trace have our standard distributed tracing enabled, you should upgrade those to Infinite Tracing. To set up a trace observer: Go to one.newrelic.com, and click Apps. Under Your apps, click New Relic Edge. Select an account in the upper-left dropdown. If you have access to multiple accounts, make sure you're in the account where you want Infinite Tracing enabled. If no trace observers are already present, click New trace observer to add one, fill out the information, and click Create. Important Note: If you select a trace observer in an EU region, you’ll still need a US-based New Relic account because data is reported to US data centers. Under the Endpoints dropdown: Copy the For other integrations endpoint value and have it ready: this will be referred to in later instructions as YOUR_TRACE_OBSERVER_URL. If you're enabling a language agent, also copy the For language agents value and have it ready: this will be referred to as YOUR_TRACE_OBSERVER_HOST. (Optional but recommended) To verify things are working, we recommend sending a sample trace payload. If you're using our Trace API: this step is especially recommended to learn how the API works. Send sample payload Important If you're using Zipkin-format data, see Send Zipkin payload. This test sends a sample trace payload with one trace and two spans from a service named Test Service A. To send this sample request: Get the license key for the account you want to report data to and have it ready. Copy the following curl request into a text editor: curl -i -H \"Content-Type: application/json\" \\ -H \"Api-Key: $YOUR_LICENSE_KEY\" \\ -H 'Data-Format: newrelic' \\ -H 'Data-Format-Version: 1' \\ -X POST \\ -d '[ { \"common\": { \"attributes\": { \"environment\": \"staging\" } }, \"spans\": [ { \"trace.id\": \"123456\", \"id\": \"ABC\", \"attributes\": { \"duration.ms\": 12.53, \"host\": \"host123.example.com\", \"name\": \"/home\", \"service.name\": \"Test Service A\" } }, { \"trace.id\": \"123456\", \"id\": \"DEF\", \"attributes\": { \"duration.ms\": 2.97, \"host\": \"host456.example.com\", \"error.message\": \"Invalid credentials\", \"name\": \"/auth\", \"parent.id\": \"ABC\", \"service.name\": \"Test Service B\" } } ] } ]' \\ '$YOUR_TRACE_OBSERVER_URL' Copy Insert your own values into the curl request: Value Description $YOUR_LICENSE_KEY Replace this with your license key. $YOUR_TRACE_OBSERVER_URL Replace this with the For other integrations endpoint value you copied in a previous step. Copy the curl request into a terminal and execute it. The test should return HTTP/1.1 202 Accepted, indicating success. If it does not, check the following common issues: Confirm that you used the For other integrations endpoint value. Confirm you're using single quotes around YOUR_TRACE_OBSERVER_URL. Check that you're using the correct API key. If your test returned HTTP/1.1 202 Accepted, go to the New Relic UI to see a query of the sample payload data using the span attribute service.name = Test Service A (here's a link for that query). Because the sample payload contains an error attribute, the error sampler will mark it for keeping. If you modify the payload to remove the error attributes, the random sampler may not choose to keep this particular trace. Tip Traces may take up to one minute to show up in the UI. (Optional) There are several ways to configure Infinite Tracing. This configuration can wait until after you've completed the enable procedures. This procedure is complete. Next, return to finish any remaining instructions for the tracing tool you started enabling: Language agents Third-party telemetry integrations (OpenTelemetry and others) Trace API: once the trace observer is set up, you're finished and can start instrumenting your application. Trace observer endpoints In the trace observer UI, there's an Endpoints dropdown. When setting up the trace observer, we have you copy these values for use at various points of our tracing tool setup instructions. There are two values: For language agents: This value is referenced in our code examples as YOUR_TRACE_OBSERVER_HOST. This is used for configuring our language agents to send data to the trace observer. For other integrations: This value is referenced in our code examples as YOUR_TRACE_OBSERVER_URL. This is used for configuring our telemetry integrations and for sending data via the Trace API (including sending sample payloads).",

      "body": "Errors inbox is a single place to proactively detect, triage, and take action on all the errors before they impact customers. Receive alerts whenever a critical, customer-impacting error arises via your preferred communication channel, like Slack. Resolve errors faster with errors from across your stack, including all APM, browser (RUM), mobile, and serverless (AWS Lambda) data, displayed on one screen. Errors are grouped to cut down on noise, and collaborating across teams is easy with shared visibility to the same error data. Important Errors inbox is not available in the EU region. Why it matters Errors inbox provides a unified error tracking experience to detect and triage errors: View and triage issues across applications and services that your team cares about for faster error resolutions. Proactive notifications with detailed error information in Slack. Error profiles to show similarities between error events and surface the root cause by analyzing attributes. Analyze errors in context of the full stack and resolve errors with precision. APM, browser, mobile, and AWS Lambda Functions errors are all captured in the same inbox. Ready to get started? Make sure you have a New Relic account. It's free, forever! Set up errors inbox To enable errors inbox, follow these steps. Afterwards, errors groups should start to appear in your inbox. From one.newrelic.com select Errors inbox from the top nav. If this is your first time accessing errors inbox, you will be prompted to select a workload in the top left. If you have no workloads set up, you will be prompted to create one before you can use errors inbox. Once you select your workload, your inbox should populate with error groups. one.newrelic.com > More > Errors inbox Monitor errors Once you've set up your errors inbox, you can begin proactively monitoring all errors in your stack: Error groups Error groups are sets of events that make up a unique error. Error groups are stored long term and contain metrics, activity log, discussions, and basic information about the unique error. Error groups are tied to the entity, so making a change to the state of an error group in one errors inbox will impact all other inboxes that contain that entity. How error groups work Error events get grouped into an error group when they share the same fingerprint. As events are ingested by New Relic, we run the events through a set of managed rules that output a fingerprint. Every unique fingerprint has a single error group associated with it. The New Relic managed rules normalize the error data, identifying and ignoring unique values such as UUIDs, hex values, email addresses, etc. that would cause grouping “like” errors into unique groups. NR account ID, entity ID, error class, error message, stack trace and exception are all data that can impact a fingerprint. Troubleshooting: similar looking events do not group together If you see “like” error events grouped into different error groups incorrectly, try removing the unique identifier from the error class or message and store those as attributes instead. This will allow you to more easily facet on the attribute values and reduce the number of error groups. If you have a single application reporting as multiple entities in New Relic (i.e. running in different clusters, cells, etc), you might see duplicate error groups, since our grouping logic looks at account and entity IDs as part of the fingerprinting process. You can consider rolling up the multiple entities into a single entity and including only that rolled up entity as part of your errors inbox. You can also use the feedback tool in NR1 to share error groups that could use improved grouping. We’re continually updating our rules to improve the quality of error groups. Occurrences Your errors inbox displays the total number of occurrences of each error group within the selected timeframe. The corresponding sparkline chart displays the total number of occurrences per day over the selected timeframe as you hover over it. Sort By Filter Using the dropdown in the top right, you can sort the list of grouped errors by the number of occurrences or by the error that was last seen (latest first). Triage errors Errors status Errors inbox enables you to triage error groups directly from the main screen or from the error details page. Triaging helps remove the noise from your errors inbox, and lets you focus on the high impact errors that need attention. You can set one of three statuses, and filter your inbox by status. Unresolved: This is the default status of error groups. Resolved: Setting an error as resolved will hide it from the default inbox view unless filters are updated to include resolved errors. If events matching the error group fingerprint occur after marking an error group as resolved, it will automatically reset the status to Unresolved. This can be useful for identifying regressions. Ignored: Ignored will hide the error group from the inbox view unless filters are updated to include ignored errors, or until you stop ignoring the error group. Error details Clicking on a specific error group takes you to the error details page, where you will find full context of the issue. This context can assist in triaging the error and assigning it to the correct team or individual. Occurrences The Occurrences tab includes details like: Related account Stack trace Logs in context Error attributes Number and frequency of occurrences The detailed view also allows you to view specific errors. In the top right, you can navigate between the first instance of the error, the last, and any instance in-between. Attributes The Attributes tab enables you to quickly find commonalities between the related errors for faster resolution. Click on a specific attribute to open a sidebar with specific details. Activity The Activity tab displays a log of the status changes and user assignments of an error group. Discussions The Discussions tab provides room for detailed and organized collaboration. This is key to looping in collaborators and ensuring the entire team has the same context regardless of where they sit. Discussions includes: Threaded conversations: Reply directly to top level comments to tie replies to specific posts. Comment deletion: Delete comments. The content of the post will be removed unless it is the parent of a thread, in which case the box will remain with the message “Comment deleted by user.” Markdown support: Add styling and links to your comments in Markdown. Assign errors You can assign an error group to anyone. Simply select the user from the assign dropdown menu. You may also assign an error to any email address, even if they aren’t a New Relic user. You can update the filter in errors inbox to show only errors assigned to yourself, or a teammate. Important Currently assigning an error group to a user does not send a notification. Notifications of assignment and changes to error groups will be coming soon. Connect an inbox to Slack When connected to Slack, new and resurfaced error groups will be sent to a Slack channel within seconds of them occurring. This enables your team to quickly identify any new errors or regressions, and resolve them quickly with direct links to the stack trace. This short video shows how it works (1:24 minutes): To connect an inbox to Slack: If your Slack workspace does not have the New Relic app installed, do that first. From an inbox, select the Inbox Settings icon (looks like a gear) in the top right corner. Toggle the Slack button to on if it is off. If no workspaces are available, click the plus button to enable Slack with a one click Slack authentication. Once authenticated, you will be able to select a Workspace and specific Channel to send notifications to. Click Test to ensure messages are being sent to the right channel. Connect errors inbox to CodeStream To use CodeStream's Open in IDE integration with your APM stack trace errors, use environment variables to configure your APM agent with your application's commit sha and/or your release tag associated with the running version of your software. Once set up, you can jump from an error group directly to the offending code in your IDE by clicking the Open in IDE button. Learn more here. Connect an inbox to Jira Connect errors inbox to Jira to easily create tickets for your errors, allowing for faster collaboration and resolution. Jira templates allow you to quickly create a ticket containing error details and links directly to the stack trace and APM for quick access and resolution. We store a link to the the ticket alongside the associated error group for a period of time. If the error occurs again within that period, you can easily access associated tickets. Important New Relic currently supports Atlassian-Jira Classic (company-managed) projects. To connect an inbox to Jira: Click on the Jira integration icon on the far right side of the error group you want to connect to Jira. Clicking the Jira integration icon allows you to create a ticket based on a template, or create a template if you don't already have one. If you don’t already have a connection to Jira set up in your account, click Add JIRA Workspace from the dropdown. Fill in all the fields and click Test connection before saving to ensure that your details are correct. Next, set up a template. Templates determine what information will be sent to Jira. Find more information about specific fields here. Errors inbox does not currently support two-way communication with Jira, but you can select this option in case it is supported in the future. Once you have a template, click Send test notification to preview what the ticket looks like in Jira. If the preview looks good, click Update message to save the template. Note that a test notification will create a Jira ticket in your Jira workspace. Now your team can create Jira tickets by clicking the Jira integration icon on the far right side of the error group and selecting a template. Jira settings are associated with the account that owns the error group or entity. If you are using the cross-account errors inbox, you will need to set up a Jira connection multiple times.",

The page that opens is index.js, the file that manages the parts of the home page, but not the content. It's rare that you'll need to make changes to this file. Most home page changes will be to add a new tile or section to the page, or update links. These types of changes are handled in two files: src/data/homepage.yml - contains home page section titles, section descriptions, and the URLs for tiles. src/i18n/translations/en/translation.json - contains tile info, including the title and short description of tiles. Update a link's URL Change or add new links using homepage.yml. In homepage.yml, search for the link you want to change. Edit the URL, save, commit, and PR the change. Add a new tile to the home page You'll make changes to both homepage.yml and translations.json On the translations.json doc, find the spot where you want to add the new tile (which section, and in what order you want it to appear), and add a new entry with this format: \"t#\": { \"title\": \"tile name\", \"description\": \"Short description.\" }, Copy Make sure you update the number on the tile. If you want to insert it in the middle of a group, update all the subsequent tile numbers as well. Save the file.

Then, after you install the agent, you can start working with your data. Ready to get started? Start benefiting from APM in five simple steps (and just a few minutes!). Sign up for a New Relic account (it's free, forever!). Install and customize the language agent for your app. Generate some traffic for your app. Wait a few minutes for New Relic to start receiving your data. Log in to your account, and start exploring New Relic! Use the Explorer in New Relic One to access and observe the full stack of your software, including your apps, see performance data and alerting status at a glance, and check relationships. We provide you with a simple, yet powerful visual tool to monitor all your entities, that is, anything we can identify that reports data. In the New Relic ecosystem, entities include basic components like applications, hosts, containers, or database services, but it can also refer to custom groupings of such elements. You can also create your own entities. If data does not appear after waiting a few minutes, follow the troubleshooting tips for your APM agent. Identify problems before your users do Our APM agents report and store the state of your application so you can quickly identify potential problems before they affect your end users. With APM, your DevOps teams don't need to guess whether a performance blocker comes from the app itself, CPU availability, database loads, or something entirely unexpected. Use our APM solutions to gather both current and historical information about memory usage, CPU utilization, database query performance, web browser rendering performance, app availability, error analysis, external services, and other useful metrics. Monitor all aspects of your business Take advantage of these APM features, and more: Features Description App performance at a glance When you sign in to APM and select an app for your account, use the Summary page to quickly examine relationships across different aspects of your environment; for example: Web transactions response time: Where is the most time being spent? In the request queue, during different stages of page rendering and execution, from external services, or something else? Transaction traces: Which transactions are the slowest, and why? Error rate and throughput: What relationship is there between a spike in errors or slower throughput for a particular time period? Was there a deployment or outage at that time? Hosts: What kind of impact does this have on CPU usage, memory, etc.? Apdex: How are these events affecting customers' satisfaction with the site? Web and non-web transactions Start by comparing the top twenty web transactions or non-web transactions in terms of most time consuming, slowest average response time, highest throughput, or worst Apdex. From there, drill down into deeper trace levels for individual transactions, which in turn break down into smaller segments and components, from HTTPS requests on down to SQL queries. Want to explore even deeper? Set up distributed tracing to see how requests move across a distributed system. Select the transactions that are most important to your business (key transactions). APM and Infrastructure When your APM and Infrastructure accounts are linked, you will have access to APM data charts on these Infrastructure UI pages: Hosts, Network, Storage, and Processes. Distributed tracing Distributed tracing gives you visibility across distributed systems, showing you the path of a request as it travels between services. This feature is especially valuable for large, distributed systems that rely on many small services and microservices. Logs Bring your logs and application's data together to make troubleshooting easier and faster. With logs in context, you can see log messages related to your errors and traces directly in your app's UI. You can also see logs in context of your infrastructure data, such as Kubernetes clusters. No need to switch to another UI page in New Relic One. Service maps APM's service maps show your app's connections and dependencies, including databases and external services. Health indicators and performance metrics show you the current operational status for every part of your architecture. You can create and customize service maps to visualize and monitor your complex architectures. Query your data You can query and visualize your data: Sample and search APM transaction and error data to gain full understanding of the data being collected. Browse your data visually with the data explorer. Create custom SQL-like queries of your data using the New Relic Query Language (NRQL), or using our PromQL-style queries. Use dashboards to build advanced data visualizations, contextualize data, and understand what's going on in your system, real-time. These are just a few of APM's features.

If you're trying to switch between accounts, use the account switcher. account switcher If you have access to more than one account in a multi-account organization, you can use the account switcher to switch between accounts. This is located in the top right of most New Relic UI pages. For more on factors that affect access to accounts, see Factors affecting access. To find account settings, use the account dropdown. administrator A type of user role on a New Relic account. For more information, see Users. agent At New Relic, an agent is a piece of monitoring software that provides integrations with various technologies (for example, web frameworks, host operating systems, or database types). The agents send that data to New Relic, usually on a specific cadence. For more information, see: New Relic Instant Observability Install agents agent API Some New Relic agents have agent APIs that allow you to extend the functionality of an agent. You can use the API to control, customize and extend the functionality of the agent. Here are some agent API docs: APM agents: C SDK API Go agent API Java agent API .NET agent API Node.js agent API PHP agent API Ruby agent API Python agent API Browser agent: Browser agent API Mobile agents: iOS SDK API Android SDK API aggregated metrics Aggregated metric data summarizes calls to specific methods in your application, including how many times each one was called and response times. In the New Relic UI, you see the class and method names along with their aggregate numbers. Metric data aggregation depends on the New Relic tool and your subscription level. For more information, see the documentation about data retention. aggregation delay The length of time in seconds to wait for the aggregation window to fill with data. Required when using CADENCE or EVENT_FLOW aggreation_method types. aggregation function You can use NRQL query functions, such as sum(), average(), or latest() to choose how the data points in an aggregation window should be processed into a single data point. The single aggregated data point is what's passed through the alert evaluation process. aggregation method New Relic aggregates data into windows, and needs to determine when the current window ends and the next one begins. The aggregation_method is the logic that tells us when we have all the data for a given aggregation window. Once the window is closed, the data is aggregated into a single point and evaluated against the threshold. This field is optional. One of the following three values can be specified: EVENT_FLOW: (Default) Each aggregation window will wait until it starts to see timestamps arrive that are past its own delay setting. Once this occurs, the data is published. Relies on the timestamps of arriving data, so wall-clock time is no longer relevant. Works best for sources that come in frequently and with low event spread (high througput metrics) CADENCE: Classic New Relic logic where each evaluation window waits exactly as long as the aggregation_delay setting, using the wall-clock time as a timer. aggregation_delay is required when using this option. Data arriving too late will be dropped, which can cause false alerts. EVENT_TIMER: Each aggregation window has a timer on it, set to the aggregation_timer setting. The Timer starts running as soon as the first data point appears for that aggregation window (based on the data point’s timestamp). The aggregation_timer is reset for each new data point that arrives for that window. Once the aggregation_timer reaches 0, the aggregation window is published. Ideal for sparse and batched data, such as cloud integrations and infrequent error logs. aggregation timer The length of time in seconds to wait after each data point received, to ensure the entire batch is processed. Required when using EVENT_TIMER aggregation_method type. aggregation window Streaming alerts gathers data together into specific amounts of time. These windows of time are customizable. Data points are collected together based their timestamps and reported as a batch. The customizable aggregation window provides greater flexibility and fewer false violations when alerting on irregular or less frequent data points. alert An alert communicates an event or incident that designated personnel can track through Alerts. For an explanation of how basic alerts concepts are related, see Concepts and workflow. alert condition An alert condition (or condition), identified by its unique numeric condition_id, contains the criteria for creating a violation. The condition includes the threshold that is set for a metric timeslice or a custom metric over time on a chosen target. For an explanation of how a condition relates to other basic alerts concepts, see Concepts and workflow. alert evaluation Streaming data is assessed on a set of aggregation windows to determine if an alert condition is violating or recovering. The aggregation window time is how long we'll collect data before running the NRQL query condition. The offset evaluation time is how long you want us to wait for late data before assessing it. If a window doesn't have any data points, it's treated as a gap for loss of signal. alert policy A collection of one or more conditions, one or more notification channels, and an Incident preference setting. If a condition contained within the policy opens a violation, an incident may be opened depending on the Incident preference setting. Notifications will then be sent to all channels attached to the policy. For an explanation of how a policy relates to other basic alerts concepts, see Concepts and workflow. apdex Apdex is an industry-standard way to measure users' satisfaction with the response time of an application or service. New Relic rates each response as Satisfied, Tolerated, or Frustrated, and uses these ratings to calculate an overall user satisfaction score. For more information, see Apdex: Measure user satisfaction. apdex_f The response time above which a transaction are rated frustrating. Defaults to four times apdex_t. Requests that complete in less than apdex_t are rated satisfied. Requests that take longer than apdex_t, but less than four times apdex_t (apdex_f), are tolerated. Any requests that take longer than apdex_f are rated frustrating. For more information, see Apdex: Measure user satisfaction. apdex_t The response time above which a transaction is considered tolerable. The default value is 0.5 seconds, but you can change this in your Apdex settings. Requests that complete in less than apdex_t are rated satisfied. Requests that take more than apdex_t, but less than apdex_f, are tolerated. Any requests that take longer than apdex_f are rated frustrating. For more information, see Apdex: Measure user satisfaction. API (application programming interface) New Relic offers a variety of APIs and SDKs. For more information, see the introduction to New Relic's APIs. APM New Relic's APM (application performance monitoring) provides monitoring of your web or non-web application's performance. APM supports apps using several programming languages. application For New Relic purposes, any program instrumented by New Relic. application ID Some New Relic solutions assign a monitored application a unique application ID, often shortened to app ID. When present, this ID is available in the UI. It is also reported as an attribute and can be queried. For how to determine this, see Find app ID. application name The name that New Relic combines with your license key to uniquely identify a particular app. For more information, see Name your application. Applied Intelligence (AI) Applied Intelligence (AI) helps you find, troubleshoot, and resolve problems more quickly. Specifically, it’s a hybrid machine learning engine that reduces alert noise, correlates incidents, and automatically detects anomalies. Applied Intelligence includes Alerts, Incident Intelligence, and Proactive Detection. attribute Attributes are key-value pairs attached to data objects reported to New Relic. Attributes add detail, and they're similar to tags or labels in other SaaS software. You can explore this data by querying or searching via the UI or by using the data dictionary. Examples: APM reports a Transaction event. This includes timing data for the transaction in a duration attribute, which might have a value of .002. Our Infrastructure Monitoring reports a ProcessSample event. This includes a variety of CPU usage attributes, including a cpuSystemPercent attribute, which might have a value of .01. Our Telemetry SDK reports a Metric data type for storing metrics, with attached attributes like metricName and newrelic.source. Some New Relic tools allow you to report custom attributes to enhance your monitoring. For more information about attributes in APM, see Agent attributes. availability monitoring See Types of Synthetics monitors. browser The New Relic UI supports most browsers. For more information, see Supported browsers. For our end-user browser monitoring tool, see Browser Monitoring. Browser monitoring A Real User Monitoring (RUM) solution that measures the speed and performance of your end users as they navigate to your site from different web browsers, devices, operating systems, and networks. background external See web external. child account See parent account. cloud-based integration New Relic offers cloud-based integrations with providers such as Amazon Web Services (AWS), Microsoft Azure, and Google Cloud Platform. collector The component that collects data from New Relic agents running on an app server, mobile device, or end-user browser. While the agent is installed on a user's app server, the collectors are centrally located in New Relic's data center. In order to contact the collector, the agent must be able to reach New Relic's domains and IP addresses. (The exact domain or IP depends on the New Relic monitoring tool.) The collector receives and interprets this data, and stores it in a database. The data is then retrieved and presented in the New Relic UI and by our various REST APIs. Command line interface (CLI) Our command line interface (CLI) is a tool you can use to build a New Relic application. This is the same tool our own engineers use. Go here for quick start instructions. Go to our Developer site for sample apps and guides. compute unit (CU) A unit of measurement that determines your pricing for some New Relic products governed by our original product-based pricing model. For more information, see Compute unit pricing. condition_id See alert condition. CPM (calls per minute) The number of calls your application receives each minute. This usually corresponds to the number of page views or external connections, and is usually the same as RPM (requests per minute). CPU burn The time consumed by code minus the wait time for a transaction. This is the time actually spent processing the transaction. It appears in the New Relic UI at the top of the transaction view for the agents that provide it (Ruby and PHP only). custom attribute A key-value pair added to a transaction or event in order to gain additional information about it. For more information, see custom attributes. custom dashboard A customizable dashboard with charts and tables that includes data from multiple New Relic data sources. For more information, see dashboards. custom event An event, in New Relic terms, is a data object with attached attributes. New Relic reports default event types, like Transaction and TransactionError. You can also create your own events. Events can be queried, and are used in some other features. You can generate custom events with APM agents, the browser monitoring agent, the mobile monitoring agents, and via the Event API. Alternatively, you can add custom attributes to some existing default New Relic events. custom instrumentation Custom instrumentation allows you to extend New Relic's monitoring to instrument code elements New Relic doesn't automatically instrument. Custom instrumentation is useful when your framework is not supported by New Relic, or when New Relic fails to pick up some element of your program. You can also use custom instrumentation to block a transaction from being reported entirely. For more information, see Custom instrumentation. custom metric Metric timeslice data that is manually recorded via an API call. Custom metrics allow you to record arbitrary metrics; for example, timing or computer resource data. All custom metric names must be prefixed with Custom/. For more information, see Custom metrics. Not to be confused with custom instrumentation data. data collector See collector. data explorer Use the data explorer to access, query and customize your data, create visualizations, and make connections between your services in a consistent and curated experience. For more on using the data explorer, see Introduction to the data explorer. degradation period When a data source enters a violating state, a degradation period of time begins. The degradation period is set in the condition's threshold. A violation will open if the source stays in a violating state for the entire degradation period. In addition: If the data source enters a non-violating state before the entire time has elapsed, the degradation period countdown is reset, and a violation does not open. If your alert condition threshold is configured as at least once in, the degradation period always lasts a single minute. dimensional metric A dimensional metric is a metric that has multiple attributes, also known as dimensions. At New Relic, we report dimensional metrics using the Metric data type. For more on other metric data types, see Metric data. Docker An open platform for distributed applications, which allows you to assemble multi-container portable apps. Infrastructure Monitoring includes integrated Docker monitoring. For more information about Docker, see the Docker website. downtime The period of time when customers cannot access your site and your app is not reporting to New Relic. For more information, see Synthetic Monitoring and Types of synthetic monitors. entity In New Relic, an entity is anything we can identify that has data you can monitor. An entity can be something you monitor directly, like applications and microservices, or indirectly, like data centers. You can identify one or more entities to be targets for alert conditions. In the Alerts API, the entity being monitored is identified with an entity_id. For more on this, see What are entities? event The word event is a general term that can have many meanings. At New Relic, event can have several meanings: At New Relic, event data is one of our core data types. Event data represents a record of a single event at a particular moment in time. Events can vary by type (for example, Transaction or Mobile, and will have associated attributes (for example, timestamp or transactionName). For more details, see Event data. For our infrastructure monitoring, the word event can be used to refer to important system and host activity. For example, a configuration change for a monitored host would be registered on Infrastructure's Events UI page. For alerts, the Events UI page displays a list of alerts-related incidents for your monitored entities. Events are reported for a violation opening and for closing. In some contexts, event can refer to any NRQL-queryable data type. For example, when you run a NRQL query, you will see a count of inspected events: this refers to a count of all data types queried. expected error An expected error is a common error that you don't want to affect your Apdex score or error rate. For more information, see Manage errors in APM. exporter At New Relic, an exporter is a type of integration that reports telemetry data to New Relic from a third-party (non-New Relic) telemetry tool. For examples, see Exporters, or search our integration quickstarts in New Relic I/O. Flex New Relic Flex is an application-agnostic, all-in-one infrastructure integration. With it, you can build your own integration that collects metric data from a wide variety of services, and that can instrument any app that exposes metrics over a standard protocol (HTTP, file, shell) in a standard format (for example, JSON or plain text) to the terminal. It's a recommended way to create a custom integration, because it doesn't require coding skills. framework A framework is a structured collection of pre-defined functions, into which an application builder inserts their own code to build their application. A framework is not the same as a library. While a library is a collection of functions you can call as needed, a framework is a skeleton for your application. The functions in that framework then call your functions. For more about the distinction between a framework and a library, see What is the difference between a framework and a library?. New Relic automatically instruments many common frameworks. For more about the frameworks New Relic supports, see the agent-specific documentation: C SDK supported frameworks Go supported frameworks Java supported frameworks .NET supported frameworks Node.js supported frameworks PHP supported frameworks Python supported frameworks Ruby supported frameworks harvest cycle The period of time between each connection from a New Relic agent to the collector. Between harvest cycles, an agent collects and caches data. At the end of the cycle an agent reports those data to the collector, then begins a new harvest cycle. health status indicator Some New Relic UI pages have a health status indicator appearing next to an index of monitored entities. This is a colored bar (generally green, yellow, red, or gray) indicating the status of your app or other entity monitored by New Relic. It also indicates whether the entity has any alert policies assigned to it and whether there are any policy violations. In general, the colored bar will be green, yellow, red, or gray to indicate the health status. Exceptions: Our REST API (v2) uses orange instead of yellow for the application's health and reporting status. Service maps use different criteria for reporting the health of a connection between an app and an external service not monitored by New Relic (for example, a third party API). host At New Relic, a host means one of the following: A physical machine is a hardware-based device with dedicated physical resources, including memory, processing, and storage. Each machine has its own OS which applications run on. A virtual machine (VM) is the software implementation of a physical machine that executes programs like a physical machine. One or more virtual machines can run on a physical machine. Each virtual machine has its own OS and allocated virtual machine resources such as RAM and CPU. A cloud instance is a type of virtual machine that is run in the public cloud. In this context, virtual machines and cloud instances are different from Java Virtual Machines (JVMs) and containers. host ID Each host identified by APM is assigned a host ID. This ID is used to uniquely identify it, and to retrieve data about that host via the REST API. For more information, see List host ID. ignored error An error that you have told the APM agent not to report to the collector. For more information, see Manage errors in APM. incident An incident is a collection of one or more violations of the conditions defined in an alert policy. An incident record includes all of the open and close time stamps for each violation, as well as chart snapshots of the data being evaluated around the time of each violation. You can view detailed information from the Incidents pages in the user interface. You can also select your preference for how we roll up violations into the incident. For an explanation of how an incident relates to other basic alerts concepts, see Concepts and workflow. Infrastructure monitoring By connecting changes in host performance to changes in your configuration, infrastructure monitoring provides real-time metrics and powerful analytics that reduce your mean-time-to-resolution (MTTR). Infrastructure is specifically designed for complex environments that need flexible, dynamic server monitoring, from a physical datacenter to thousands of Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) instances and other types of integrations. Insights Insights was the name for the New Relic product that previously governed the reporting of custom events, as well as the ability to query and chart your New Relic data. These features are now a fundamental part of the New Relic One platform and are no longer governed by the Insights product or name. To learn more about these features: Event API for reporting custom events Query and chart data For historical reasons, the word \"Insights\" is still used in some places. For example: Some APM agents still have Insights language in their codebase. For example, the Java agent custom_insights_events configuration. For New Relic organizations on our original pricing model, Insights Pro is still the product name governing custom event data ingest and retention. There is an API key called the Insights insert key. instance ID Each instance identified by New Relic is assigned a unique instance ID. Instance IDs are most commonly found for JVMs (Java Virtual Machines), but can exist for each agent. This ID is used to uniquely identify it, and to retrieve data about that instance via the REST API. For more information, see List instance IDs. instrumentation The collection of data from an application or host. When New Relic instruments a framework, it detects the methods and calls used by that framework, and intelligently groups them together. integration At New Relic, an integration refers to a solution that integrates with a specific technology (like a web framework or a type of database). All our integrations can be found as quickstarts in New Relic Instant Observability. interaction In our mobile monitoring, an interaction is a specific code path initiated by a user interaction (usually a button press). An interaction is the mobile equivalent of a transaction, and like a transaction an interaction can be traced and monitored. You can see much of the data included in an interaction in the BrowserInteraction event. interaction trace An interaction trace is a complete picture of a single interaction. With interaction traces, New Relic gives you much deeper visibility into a single slow interaction, which can help you understand a broader problem. Interaction traces are the mobile equivalent of a transaction trace. For more information, see Creating interactions (iOS) and Creating interactions (Android). inventory data Inventory data is information about the status or configuration of a service or host. Examples of inventory data include: Configuration settings Name of the host the service is on Amazon AWS region Port being used For more information, see Understand and use data. key transaction A web transaction that the user has marked as particularly important; for example, key business events (such as signups or purchase confirmations), or transactions with a high performance impact (such as searches). Key transactions have their own pages in the UI and other customized values. For more information, see Key transactions. launcher A launcher is a specific piece of code you can include when you create a New Relic One app. It creates the tile on the homepage that you click to launch the app. For more information, see the documentation about core UI components. log A log is a message about a system used to understand the activity of the system and to diagnose problems. For more information on how we use log data, see Log management. Log monitoring Our log management and monitoring features give you the tools to collect, process, explore, visualize, and alert on your log data using your existing log forwarder. With all of your log data in one place, you'll be able to make better decisions, detect and resolve problems more quickly, and see your logs in context to troubleshoot faster. Logs Our Logs feature is a scalable log management platform that allows you to connect your log data with the rest of your telemetry data. Pre-built plugins with some of the most common open-source logging tools make it simple to send your data from anywhere to New Relic. Logs in context Logs in context makes it easy to link to your log data with related data across the rest of our platform. Bringing all of this data together in a single tool allows you to quickly get to the root cause of an issue and find the log lines that you need to identify and resolve a problem. master account See parent account. metric A metric is a numeric measurement. Metric data is a broad category because there are several ways to make and report measurements. For more about how metrics are reported at New Relic, see New Relic data types. metric timeslice New Relic reports metrics in several ways. One variety of metric data is called metric timeslice data; this is the type of data used to generate many of the charts in APM, mobile monitoring, and browser monitoring (for more details, see metric timeslice data). Over time, metric timeslice data is aggregated into longer timeslice data records for more efficient storage. For more about how we aggregate this type of data, see Data aggregation. For how to query this type of data, see Query metric timeslice data. metric grouping issue A metric grouping issue occurs when an account sends too many differently named metric timeslice data points to New Relic, and those individual web transactions are not properly aggregated. For example, rather than a single /user/controlpanel/ metric name, you might see /user/controlpanel/alice, /user/controlpanel/bob, and /user/controlpanel/carol. For more information, see Metric grouping issues. minion The software that accepts monitor jobs from a private location. A minion is a packaged virtual appliance that runs in your hypervisor. For more information, see Private locations overview and install and configure private minions. Mobile monitoring Mobile monitoring allows you to monitor and manage the performance of your mobile apps on Android, iOS, tvOS, and other systems. Mobile monitoring provides end-to-end details, including crashes, throughput, HTTP requests, error traces, and more. Not to be confused with New Relic's own mobile apps for Android, iPhone, and iPad. monitor For our Synthetic Monitoring, a monitor ensures your website or API endpoint is available. For more information, see Adding and editing monitors. NerdGraph NerdGraph is our GraphQL API, an efficient and flexible query language that lets you request exactly the data you need, without over-fetching or under-fetching. NerdGraph calls get all the data you need in a single request. NerdGraph also makes it easier to evolve APIs over time and enables powerful developer tools. You can use our NerdGraph GraphiQL explorer to explore the schema and find definitions. With valid New Relic API key, you can try it out yourself at api.newrelic.com/graphiql. Nerdlet A Nerdlet is a component of a New Relic One application. It's a specific UI view, represented by a React JavaScript package. For more information, see Nerdpack file structure. Nerdpack A Nerdpack is a component of a New Relic One application. It's the package containing all the files needed by that application. For more information, see Nerdpack file structure. New Relic Edge with Infinite Tracing New Relic Edge with Infinite Tracing is a fully managed, distributed tracing service that observes 100% of your application traces, then provides actionable data so you can solve issues faster. For more information, see /docs/understand-dependencies/distributed-tracing/get-started/how-new-relic-distributed-tracing-works. New Relic One For more information, see Introduction to New Relic One. New Relic One catalog Our catalog is a collection of applications built on the New Relic One platform. The catalog includes custom apps we've built, public open source apps, and any apps that you buid. You can browse the catalog on New Relic One. NRQL (New Relic query language) NRQL is a query language, similar in form to SQL, that allows you to query the data stored in your New Relic account. non-web transaction APM identifies transactions as either web or non-web. When New Relic does not detect a transaction was initiated by a web request, this is called a non-web transaction. For more information, see Background processes and other non-web transactions. notification The message sent when an incident opens, is acknowledged, or closes. The type of notification is defined by the alert policy's notification channel. For an explanation of how notifications relate to other basic alerts concepts, see Concepts and workflow. notification channel Where we send a notification when an incident opens, is acknowledged, or closes. Available channels include email, mobile push notifications, webhooks, and more. on-host integration On-host integrations refer to integrations that reside on your own servers or hosts and that communicate with our infrastructure agent. For more information, see Introduction to on-host integrations. owner For accounts on our original pricing model, this is a type of user role: the user who initially created the account. For more information, see Users. page load timing With page load timing, New Relic monitors the full load time for end-user browsers. New Relic's application agents dynamically inject JavaScript into the page, then capture the following key load points: Navigation start: The user initiates the transaction. First byte: The browser receives the requested page. DOM ready: The browser has finished parsing DOM. Page ready: Page loading is complete. Page load timing is sometimes referred to as RUM, or real user monitoring. Unlike standard RUM, page load timing also captures JavaScript errors and AJAX requests. For more information, see Page load timing process. parameter Deprecated term; see attribute. parent account New Relic organizations can have a parent/child account structure. This structure was much more important for organizations on our original user model, but is still used for some features for organizations on the New Relic One user model. Learn more about account structure. Parent accounts were previously referred to as \"master accounts\", and child accounts were previously referred to as \"sub-accounts\". permalink A unique URL that links to a view of your application at a specific point in time. Permalinks are useful for troubleshooting and for sharing interesting time windows with colleagues. pinger The component of New Relic that connects to your website to verify your website is accessible. New Relic has pingers in Europe, Asia, and the United States. Each pinger attempts to contact your website at least once every two minutes. If enough pingers are unable to reach your website, your application will be considered down. For in-depth scriptable testing, including real browser tests and tests of API endpoints, see Synthetic Monitoring. Synthetic Monitoring includes free ping monitoring, which allows you to monitor your website from locations around the world. For more information, see Types of Synthetic monitors. polling interval (AWS) Our Amazon integrations query your AWS services according to a polling interval, which varies depending on the integration. Each polling interval occurs for every AWS entity. For example, if you have thirteen Elastic Load Balancers (ELB), each one will be polled every five minutes. Depending on the AWS integration, there may be delays in the timing between the API request and the metric data returned. If you notice unusual delays, follow the integration troubleshooting procedures. PPM (pages per minute) The number of pages per minute your application serves. private location A Synthetic monitor feature that allows you to run Synthetic monitors from within your own systems by creating private minions. Private locations allow you to extend your Synthetic coverage to new geographical locations, and to monitor websites behind your firewall such as an intranet site. For more information, see Private locations overview. recovery period A recovery period of time begins when a data source enters a non-violating state after being in a violating state. The recovery period is set in the condition's threshold. A violation will close when a source remains in a non-violating state and the recovery period time has elapsed. If the data source enters a violating state before the time has elapsed, the recovery period clock will reset and the violation won't close. response time The duration of time between a request for service and a response. For more information, see Response time. restricted user A type of user role on a New Relic account. For more information, see Users. rollup Using the same application name for multiple applications. This allows you to combine data in APM, either from multiple applications, or from multiple instances of an application. For more information, see Rolling up app data. root span For distributed tracing, the root span is the first span in a trace. In many cases, the root span duration will represent the duration of the entire trace, or be very close to it. However, for more complex, modern systems that use a lot of asynchronous, non-blocking processes, this will not be true. For those systems, the root span’s duration may be significantly less than the duration of the trace. RPM The term RPM usually refers to the number of requests per minute your application receives from users. This is usually the same as CPM (calls per minute). Historically, some New Relic monitoring solutions, like APM and Browser Monitoring, used to contain RPM in the URL; for example, https://rpm.newrelic.com. This language use originally referred to Rails performance management because the first iteration of our product monitored Ruby on Rails applications. We monitor many more languages and systems than Ruby now. RUM (real user monitoring) See page load timing. runbook A runbook contains standard procedures and operations typically used by system administrators, network operations staff, and other personnel to handle outages, alert incidents, and other situations. If your organization stores runbook instructions as URLs, you can link this information to an alerts policy so your personnel has easy access to this information when an incident violates the defined policy thresholds. SAML (Security Assertion Markup Language) SAML is an XML-based data format for sharing authentication data between two parties. New Relic accounts must obtain a SAML certificate in order to enable Single Sign On for their users. For more information, see SAML service providers. Selenium Selenium is an open-source browser testing suite. Synthetics uses Selenium to test monitored websites with real browsers. For more information, see monitor types. service A service is a cluster of runtime server processes that accomplish a particular task, usually service requests. Unlike an application, a service is not usually invoked by a human. New Relic offers a variety of integrations that allow you to report data from your services. signal The stream of telemetry data that's watched and alerted on. You use NRQL queries to define a signal. signal filter When we receive data and it's routed to the streaming alerts platform, your NRQL WHERE clause will filter the data coming in. The filtered streaming data is what's evaluated for loss of signal violations, for example. span In a distributed trace, a span is a \"named, timed operation representing a contiguous segment of work in that trace\" (from OpenTracing.io definition). For distributed tracing, spans are displayed in the distributed tracing UI, and the data type Span is available to be queried. See also root span. SSL certificate SSL certificates encrypt data that is being transmitted. While New Relic refers to security certificates as SSL because it is a more commonly used term, all certificates adhere to industry standards for secure encryption in transit. SSO (single sign on) SSO (single sign on) allows you to manage user authentication in New Relic using an external SSO provider. For more information, see Setting up SSO. streaming algorithm This is what determines when the data in an aggregation window is processed. The streaming algorithm uses your server's clock time and the aggregation window size to trigger the alert evaluation process. sub-accounts See master account. Synthetic monitoring Synthetic monitoring allows you to monitor your website or API endpoint via automated, scriptable tools. Use free ping monitor to ensure your website is accessible, or expand your monitoring with browser monitors, which test your website with real browsers. Go further with scripting, to script browsers or API monitors for sophisticated testing. target A target is a resource or component monitored by a New Relic monitoring tool that has been identified in an alert condition. When the data source for that target crosses the defined critical threshold, we will open a violation. Depending on your policy's Incident preference setting, Alerts may create an incident record and send notifications through the defined channels. See also entity. tag Tags are key:value metadata added to monitored apps, hosts, dashboards, and other entities to help you organize your data at a high level. For details, see Tags. thresholds Thresholds are alert condition settings that define a violation. Threshold values include the value a data source must pass to trigger a violation and the time-related settings that define a violation; for example: Passing a certain value for at least x minutes Passing a certain value only once in x minutes While the data source passes a certain value, a degradation period starts. Likewise, when that data source stops passing a certain value, a recovery period starts. The durations of these two time periods are defined in the alert condition threshold settings. Thresholds have a required critical (red) threshold and an optional warning (yellow) threshold. In the UI, the entity's health status indicator will change to yellow or red when a threshold has been crossed and a violation will open. For more information, see Define thresholds. For an explanation of how thresholds relate to other basic Alerts concepts, see Concepts and workflow. throughput Throughput is a measurement of user activity for a monitored application. APM throughput and Browser Monitoring throughput are measured in different ways: APM: requests per minute (RPM) Browser: page views per minute (PPM) tier A tier can refer to how New Relic categorizes or visualizes the various agent language ecosystems that we support. For example: In APM, the color-coded categories that appear on your app's main Overview chart show response time spent in various functions, processes, or agents as tiers; for example, request queuing, garbage collection, Middleware, JVMs, etc. In New Relic labels, TIER can be used to define or classify the client-server architecture; for example, front-end and back-end tiers. \"Tier\" may sometimes be used to refer to our pricing editions. time picker By default the New Relic UI shows data for the past 30 minutes, ending now. To change the time window, use the time picker. time range A time range can refer to a length of time selected in the New Relic UI. New Relic displays a time range depending on the range you select using the time picker. timeslice data See metric timeslice data. trace A trace is a description of how a request travels through a system. Trace data helps you understand the performance of your system and diagnose problems. For more information on how we use trace data, see New Relic data types. traffic light See health status. transaction A transaction is defined as one logical unit of work in an application. This term primarily refers to server-side transactions monitored by APM. For more information, see documentation about web transactions and non-web transactions. The term transaction is also sometimes used in Browser Monitoring. In that case, it primarily refers to activity beginning with a browser-side web request and ending with a complete page load. transaction trace A transaction trace is a complete picture of a single transaction, down to the database queries and exact invocation patterns. With transaction traces, New Relic gives you much deeper visibility into a single slow transaction, which can help you understand a broader problem. For more information, see Transaction traces. UI The New Relic user interface. For more information, see Standard page functions. user A user can refer to a specific user role in a New Relic account. For more information, see Users. UTC Universal Time Coordinated (UTC), or Coordinated Universal Time, is a standard timestamp for synchronizing time around the world. value function (metrics) The numeric value obtained from metric timeslice data; for example, an average, minimum, maximum, total, sample size, etc. violation A violation occurs when the entity monitored by an alert condition reports a value that crosses the thresholds defined in that condition. For an explanation of how violations relate to other basic alerts concepts, see Concepts and workflow. You can view a summary of the violations for a selected incident's page. You can also view the violations for a specific entity from the product's UI. web external Web external is the term applied to the portion of time spent in transactions to external applications from within the code of the application you are monitoring. That time can be a call to a third party company (a payment provider, for example) or it could be a call to another microservice within your own company. Web external demonstrates how performance is impacted by your code executing outside the application you are measuring. web transaction A transaction is defined as one logical unit of work in an application. This term primarily refers to server-side transactions monitored by APM. Web transactions are initiated with an HTTP request. For most organizations, these represent customer-centric interactions and thus are the most important transactions to monitor. For more information, see Web transactions and Non-web transactions. WebDriverJS WebDriver is a Selenium component, used to control Synthetics scripted browsers. Specifically, Synthetics uses WebDriverJS, a Node.js-based flavor of Selenium. For more information, see Writing scripted browsers and Scripted browser examples. workload A workload represents a group of entities that work together to provide a digital service. For more information, see Workloads.",

      "body": "Application performance monitoring (APM) is exactly what it sounds like: monitoring of your web or non-web application's performance. APM supports apps for several programming languages, including Go, Java, .NET, Node.js, PHP, Python, and Ruby, as well as a C SDK. View the status of all your services at a glance with APM. Tip This doc gives you detailed information about why APM matters to your business. But if you want to skip ahead, just sign up for a New Relic account. (It's free, forever!) Then, after you install the agent, you can start working with your data. Ready to get started? Start benefiting from APM in five simple steps (and just a few minutes!). Sign up for a New Relic account (it's free, forever!). Install and customize the language agent for your app. Generate some traffic for your app. Wait a few minutes for New Relic to start receiving your data. Log in to your account, and start exploring New Relic! Use the Explorer in New Relic One to access and observe the full stack of your software, including your apps, see performance data and alerting status at a glance, and check relationships. We provide you with a simple, yet powerful visual tool to monitor all your entities, that is, anything we can identify that reports data. In the New Relic ecosystem, entities include basic components like applications, hosts, containers, or database services, but it can also refer to custom groupings of such elements. You can also create your own entities. If data does not appear after waiting a few minutes, follow the troubleshooting tips for your APM agent. Identify problems before your users do Our APM agents report and store the state of your application so you can quickly identify potential problems before they affect your end users. With APM, your DevOps teams don't need to guess whether a performance blocker comes from the app itself, CPU availability, database loads, or something entirely unexpected. Use our APM solutions to gather both current and historical information about memory usage, CPU utilization, database query performance, web browser rendering performance, app availability, error analysis, external services, and other useful metrics. Monitor all aspects of your business Take advantage of these APM features, and more: Features Description App performance at a glance When you sign in to APM and select an app for your account, use the Summary page to quickly examine relationships across different aspects of your environment; for example: Web transactions response time: Where is the most time being spent? In the request queue, during different stages of page rendering and execution, from external services, or something else? Transaction traces: Which transactions are the slowest, and why? Error rate and throughput: What relationship is there between a spike in errors or slower throughput for a particular time period? Was there a deployment or outage at that time? Hosts: What kind of impact does this have on CPU usage, memory, etc.? Apdex: How are these events affecting customers' satisfaction with the site? Web and non-web transactions Start by comparing the top twenty web transactions or non-web transactions in terms of most time consuming, slowest average response time, highest throughput, or worst Apdex. From there, drill down into deeper trace levels for individual transactions, which in turn break down into smaller segments and components, from HTTPS requests on down to SQL queries. Want to explore even deeper? Set up distributed tracing to see how requests move across a distributed system. Select the transactions that are most important to your business (key transactions). APM and Infrastructure When your APM and Infrastructure accounts are linked, you will have access to APM data charts on these Infrastructure UI pages: Hosts, Network, Storage, and Processes. Distributed tracing Distributed tracing gives you visibility across distributed systems, showing you the path of a request as it travels between services. This feature is especially valuable for large, distributed systems that rely on many small services and microservices. Logs Bring your logs and application's data together to make troubleshooting easier and faster. With logs in context, you can see log messages related to your errors and traces directly in your app's UI. You can also see logs in context of your infrastructure data, such as Kubernetes clusters. No need to switch to another UI page in New Relic One. Service maps APM's service maps show your app's connections and dependencies, including databases and external services. Health indicators and performance metrics show you the current operational status for every part of your architecture. You can create and customize service maps to visualize and monitor your complex architectures. Query your data You can query and visualize your data: Sample and search APM transaction and error data to gain full understanding of the data being collected. Browse your data visually with the data explorer. Create custom SQL-like queries of your data using the New Relic Query Language (NRQL), or using our PromQL-style queries. Use dashboards to build advanced data visualizations, contextualize data, and understand what's going on in your system, real-time. These are just a few of APM's features.

To find account settings, use the account dropdown. administrator A type of user role on a New Relic account. For more information, see Users. agent At New Relic, an agent is a piece of monitoring software that provides integrations with various technologies (for example, web frameworks, host operating systems, or database types). The agents send that data to New Relic, usually on a specific cadence. For more information, see: New Relic Instant Observability Install agents agent API Some New Relic agents have agent APIs that allow you to extend the functionality of an agent. You can use the API to control, customize and extend the functionality of the agent. Here are some agent API docs: APM agents: C SDK API Go agent API Java agent API .NET agent API Node.js agent API PHP agent API Ruby agent API Python agent API Browser agent: Browser agent API Mobile agents: iOS SDK API Android SDK API aggregated metrics Aggregated metric data summarizes calls to specific methods in your application, including how many times each one was called and response times. In the New Relic UI, you see the class and method names along with their aggregate numbers. Metric data aggregation depends on the New Relic tool and your subscription level. For more information, see the documentation about data retention. aggregation delay The length of time in seconds to wait for the aggregation window to fill with data. Required when using CADENCE or EVENT_FLOW aggreation_method types. aggregation function You can use NRQL query functions, such as sum(), average(), or latest() to choose how the data points in an aggregation window should be processed into a single data point. The single aggregated data point is what's passed through the alert evaluation process. aggregation method New Relic aggregates data into windows, and needs to determine when the current window ends and the next one begins. The aggregation_method is the logic that tells us when we have all the data for a given aggregation window. Once the window is closed, the data is aggregated into a single point and evaluated against the threshold. This field is optional. One of the following three values can be specified: EVENT_FLOW: (Default) Each aggregation window will wait until it starts to see timestamps arrive that are past its own delay setting. Once this occurs, the data is published. Relies on the timestamps of arriving data, so wall-clock time is no longer relevant. Works best for sources that come in frequently and with low event spread (high througput metrics) CADENCE: Classic New Relic logic where each evaluation window waits exactly as long as the aggregation_delay setting, using the wall-clock time as a timer. aggregation_delay is required when using this option. Data arriving too late will be dropped, which can cause false alerts. EVENT_TIMER: Each aggregation window has a timer on it, set to the aggregation_timer setting. The Timer starts running as soon as the first data point appears for that aggregation window (based on the data point’s timestamp). The aggregation_timer is reset for each new data point that arrives for that window. Once the aggregation_timer reaches 0, the aggregation window is published. Ideal for sparse and batched data, such as cloud integrations and infrequent error logs. aggregation timer The length of time in seconds to wait after each data point received, to ensure the entire batch is processed. Required when using EVENT_TIMER aggregation_method type. aggregation window Streaming alerts gathers data together into specific amounts of time. These windows of time are customizable. Data points are collected together based their timestamps and reported as a batch. The customizable aggregation window provides greater flexibility and fewer false violations when alerting on irregular or less frequent data points. alert An alert communicates an event or incident that designated personnel can track through Alerts. For an explanation of how basic alerts concepts are related, see Concepts and workflow. alert condition An alert condition (or condition), identified by its unique numeric condition_id, contains the criteria for creating a violation. The condition includes the threshold that is set for a metric timeslice or a custom metric over time on a chosen target. For an explanation of how a condition relates to other basic alerts concepts, see Concepts and workflow. alert evaluation Streaming data is assessed on a set of aggregation windows to determine if an alert condition is violating or recovering. The aggregation window time is how long we'll collect data before running the NRQL query condition. The offset evaluation time is how long you want us to wait for late data before assessing it. If a window doesn't have any data points, it's treated as a gap for loss of signal. alert policy A collection of one or more conditions, one or more notification channels, and an Incident preference setting. If a condition contained within the policy opens a violation, an incident may be opened depending on the Incident preference setting. Notifications will then be sent to all channels attached to the policy. For an explanation of how a policy relates to other basic alerts concepts, see Concepts and workflow. apdex Apdex is an industry-standard way to measure users' satisfaction with the response time of an application or service. New Relic rates each response as Satisfied, Tolerated, or Frustrated, and uses these ratings to calculate an overall user satisfaction score. For more information, see Apdex: Measure user satisfaction. apdex_f The response time above which a transaction are rated frustrating. Defaults to four times apdex_t. Requests that complete in less than apdex_t are rated satisfied. Requests that take longer than apdex_t, but less than four times apdex_t (apdex_f), are tolerated. Any requests that take longer than apdex_f are rated frustrating. For more information, see Apdex: Measure user satisfaction. apdex_t The response time above which a transaction is considered tolerable. The default value is 0.5 seconds, but you can change this in your Apdex settings. Requests that complete in less than apdex_t are rated satisfied. Requests that take more than apdex_t, but less than apdex_f, are tolerated. Any requests that take longer than apdex_f are rated frustrating. For more information, see Apdex: Measure user satisfaction. API (application programming interface) New Relic offers a variety of APIs and SDKs. For more information, see the introduction to New Relic's APIs. APM New Relic's APM (application performance monitoring) provides monitoring of your web or non-web application's performance. APM supports apps using several programming languages. application For New Relic purposes, any program instrumented by New Relic. application ID Some New Relic solutions assign a monitored application a unique application ID, often shortened to app ID. When present, this ID is available in the UI. It is also reported as an attribute and can be queried. For how to determine this, see Find app ID. application name The name that New Relic combines with your license key to uniquely identify a particular app. For more information, see Name your application. Applied Intelligence (AI) Applied Intelligence (AI) helps you find, troubleshoot, and resolve problems more quickly. Specifically, it’s a hybrid machine learning engine that reduces alert noise, correlates incidents, and automatically detects anomalies. Applied Intelligence includes Alerts, Incident Intelligence, and Proactive Detection. attribute Attributes are key-value pairs attached to data objects reported to New Relic. Attributes add detail, and they're similar to tags or labels in other SaaS software. You can explore this data by querying or searching via the UI or by using the data dictionary. Examples: APM reports a Transaction event. This includes timing data for the transaction in a duration attribute, which might have a value of .002. Our Infrastructure Monitoring reports a ProcessSample event. This includes a variety of CPU usage attributes, including a cpuSystemPercent attribute, which might have a value of .01. Our Telemetry SDK reports a Metric data type for storing metrics, with attached attributes like metricName and newrelic.source. Some New Relic tools allow you to report custom attributes to enhance your monitoring. For more information about attributes in APM, see Agent attributes. availability monitoring See Types of Synthetics monitors. browser The New Relic UI supports most browsers. For more information, see Supported browsers. For our end-user browser monitoring tool, see Browser Monitoring. Browser monitoring A Real User Monitoring (RUM) solution that measures the speed and performance of your end users as they navigate to your site from different web browsers, devices, operating systems, and networks. background external See web external. child account See parent account. cloud-based integration New Relic offers cloud-based integrations with providers such as Amazon Web Services (AWS), Microsoft Azure, and Google Cloud Platform. collector The component that collects data from New Relic agents running on an app server, mobile device, or end-user browser. While the agent is installed on a user's app server, the collectors are centrally located in New Relic's data center. In order to contact the collector, the agent must be able to reach New Relic's domains and IP addresses. (The exact domain or IP depends on the New Relic monitoring tool.) The collector receives and interprets this data, and stores it in a database. The data is then retrieved and presented in the New Relic UI and by our various REST APIs. Command line interface (CLI) Our command line interface (CLI) is a tool you can use to build a New Relic application. This is the same tool our own engineers use. Go here for quick start instructions. Go to our Developer site for sample apps and guides. compute unit (CU) A unit of measurement that determines your pricing for some New Relic products governed by our original product-based pricing model. For more information, see Compute unit pricing. condition_id See alert condition. CPM (calls per minute) The number of calls your application receives each minute. This usually corresponds to the number of page views or external connections, and is usually the same as RPM (requests per minute). CPU burn The time consumed by code minus the wait time for a transaction. This is the time actually spent processing the transaction. It appears in the New Relic UI at the top of the transaction view for the agents that provide it (Ruby and PHP only). custom attribute A key-value pair added to a transaction or event in order to gain additional information about it. For more information, see custom attributes. custom dashboard A customizable dashboard with charts and tables that includes data from multiple New Relic data sources. For more information, see dashboards. custom event An event, in New Relic terms, is a data object with attached attributes. New Relic reports default event types, like Transaction and TransactionError. You can also create your own events. Events can be queried, and are used in some other features. You can generate custom events with APM agents, the browser monitoring agent, the mobile monitoring agents, and via the Event API. Alternatively, you can add custom attributes to some existing default New Relic events. custom instrumentation Custom instrumentation allows you to extend New Relic's monitoring to instrument code elements New Relic doesn't automatically instrument. Custom instrumentation is useful when your framework is not supported by New Relic, or when New Relic fails to pick up some element of your program. You can also use custom instrumentation to block a transaction from being reported entirely. For more information, see Custom instrumentation. custom metric Metric timeslice data that is manually recorded via an API call. Custom metrics allow you to record arbitrary metrics; for example, timing or computer resource data. All custom metric names must be prefixed with Custom/. For more information, see Custom metrics. Not to be confused with custom instrumentation data. data collector See collector. data explorer Use the data explorer to access, query and customize your data, create visualizations, and make connections between your services in a consistent and curated experience. For more on using the data explorer, see Introduction to the data explorer. degradation period When a data source enters a violating state, a degradation period of time begins. The degradation period is set in the condition's threshold. A violation will open if the source stays in a violating state for the entire degradation period. In addition: If the data source enters a non-violating state before the entire time has elapsed, the degradation period countdown is reset, and a violation does not open. If your alert condition threshold is configured as at least once in, the degradation period always lasts a single minute. dimensional metric A dimensional metric is a metric that has multiple attributes, also known as dimensions. At New Relic, we report dimensional metrics using the Metric data type. For more on other metric data types, see Metric data. Docker An open platform for distributed applications, which allows you to assemble multi-container portable apps. Infrastructure Monitoring includes integrated Docker monitoring. For more information about Docker, see the Docker website. downtime The period of time when customers cannot access your site and your app is not reporting to New Relic. For more information, see Synthetic Monitoring and Types of synthetic monitors. entity In New Relic, an entity is anything we can identify that has data you can monitor. An entity can be something you monitor directly, like applications and microservices, or indirectly, like data centers. You can identify one or more entities to be targets for alert conditions. In the Alerts API, the entity being monitored is identified with an entity_id. For more on this, see What are entities? event The word event is a general term that can have many meanings. At New Relic, event can have several meanings: At New Relic, event data is one of our core data types. Event data represents a record of a single event at a particular moment in time. Events can vary by type (for example, Transaction or Mobile, and will have associated attributes (for example, timestamp or transactionName). For more details, see Event data. For our infrastructure monitoring, the word event can be used to refer to important system and host activity. For example, a configuration change for a monitored host would be registered on Infrastructure's Events UI page. For alerts, the Events UI page displays a list of alerts-related incidents for your monitored entities. Events are reported for a violation opening and for closing. In some contexts, event can refer to any NRQL-queryable data type. For example, when you run a NRQL query, you will see a count of inspected events: this refers to a count of all data types queried. expected error An expected error is a common error that you don't want to affect your Apdex score or error rate. For more information, see Manage errors in APM. exporter At New Relic, an exporter is a type of integration that reports telemetry data to New Relic from a third-party (non-New Relic) telemetry tool. For examples, see Exporters, or search our integration quickstarts in New Relic I/O. Flex New Relic Flex is an application-agnostic, all-in-one infrastructure integration. With it, you can build your own integration that collects metric data from a wide variety of services, and that can instrument any app that exposes metrics over a standard protocol (HTTP, file, shell) in a standard format (for example, JSON or plain text) to the terminal. It's a recommended way to create a custom integration, because it doesn't require coding skills. framework A framework is a structured collection of pre-defined functions, into which an application builder inserts their own code to build their application. A framework is not the same as a library. While a library is a collection of functions you can call as needed, a framework is a skeleton for your application. The functions in that framework then call your functions. For more about the distinction between a framework and a library, see What is the difference between a framework and a library?. New Relic automatically instruments many common frameworks. For more about the frameworks New Relic supports, see the agent-specific documentation: C SDK supported frameworks Go supported frameworks Java supported frameworks .NET supported frameworks Node.js supported frameworks PHP supported frameworks Python supported frameworks Ruby supported frameworks harvest cycle The period of time between each connection from a New Relic agent to the collector. Between harvest cycles, an agent collects and caches data. At the end of the cycle an agent reports those data to the collector, then begins a new harvest cycle. health status indicator Some New Relic UI pages have a health status indicator appearing next to an index of monitored entities. This is a colored bar (generally green, yellow, red, or gray) indicating the status of your app or other entity monitored by New Relic. It also indicates whether the entity has any alert policies assigned to it and whether there are any policy violations. In general, the colored bar will be green, yellow, red, or gray to indicate the health status. Exceptions: Our REST API (v2) uses orange instead of yellow for the application's health and reporting status. Service maps use different criteria for reporting the health of a connection between an app and an external service not monitored by New Relic (for example, a third party API). host At New Relic, a host means one of the following: A physical machine is a hardware-based device with dedicated physical resources, including memory, processing, and storage. Each machine has its own OS which applications run on. A virtual machine (VM) is the software implementation of a physical machine that executes programs like a physical machine. One or more virtual machines can run on a physical machine. Each virtual machine has its own OS and allocated virtual machine resources such as RAM and CPU. A cloud instance is a type of virtual machine that is run in the public cloud. In this context, virtual machines and cloud instances are different from Java Virtual Machines (JVMs) and containers. host ID Each host identified by APM is assigned a host ID. This ID is used to uniquely identify it, and to retrieve data about that host via the REST API. For more information, see List host ID. ignored error An error that you have told the APM agent not to report to the collector. For more information, see Manage errors in APM. incident An incident is a collection of one or more violations of the conditions defined in an alert policy. An incident record includes all of the open and close time stamps for each violation, as well as chart snapshots of the data being evaluated around the time of each violation. You can view detailed information from the Incidents pages in the user interface. You can also select your preference for how we roll up violations into the incident. For an explanation of how an incident relates to other basic alerts concepts, see Concepts and workflow. Infrastructure monitoring By connecting changes in host performance to changes in your configuration, infrastructure monitoring provides real-time metrics and powerful analytics that reduce your mean-time-to-resolution (MTTR). Infrastructure is specifically designed for complex environments that need flexible, dynamic server monitoring, from a physical datacenter to thousands of Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) instances and other types of integrations. Insights Insights was the name for the New Relic product that previously governed the reporting of custom events, as well as the ability to query and chart your New Relic data. These features are now a fundamental part of the New Relic One platform and are no longer governed by the Insights product or name. To learn more about these features: Event API for reporting custom events Query and chart data For historical reasons, the word \"Insights\" is still used in some places. For example: Some APM agents still have Insights language in their codebase. For example, the Java agent custom_insights_events configuration. For New Relic organizations on our original pricing model, Insights Pro is still the product name governing custom event data ingest and retention. There is an API key called the Insights insert key. instance ID Each instance identified by New Relic is assigned a unique instance ID. Instance IDs are most commonly found for JVMs (Java Virtual Machines), but can exist for each agent. This ID is used to uniquely identify it, and to retrieve data about that instance via the REST API. For more information, see List instance IDs. instrumentation The collection of data from an application or host. When New Relic instruments a framework, it detects the methods and calls used by that framework, and intelligently groups them together. integration At New Relic, an integration refers to a solution that integrates with a specific technology (like a web framework or a type of database). All our integrations can be found as quickstarts in New Relic Instant Observability. interaction In our mobile monitoring, an interaction is a specific code path initiated by a user interaction (usually a button press). An interaction is the mobile equivalent of a transaction, and like a transaction an interaction can be traced and monitored. You can see much of the data included in an interaction in the BrowserInteraction event. interaction trace An interaction trace is a complete picture of a single interaction. With interaction traces, New Relic gives you much deeper visibility into a single slow interaction, which can help you understand a broader problem. Interaction traces are the mobile equivalent of a transaction trace. For more information, see Creating interactions (iOS) and Creating interactions (Android). inventory data Inventory data is information about the status or configuration of a service or host. Examples of inventory data include: Configuration settings Name of the host the service is on Amazon AWS region Port being used For more information, see Understand and use data. key transaction A web transaction that the user has marked as particularly important; for example, key business events (such as signups or purchase confirmations), or transactions with a high performance impact (such as searches). Key transactions have their own pages in the UI and other customized values. For more information, see Key transactions. launcher A launcher is a specific piece of code you can include when you create a New Relic One app. It creates the tile on the homepage that you click to launch the app. For more information, see the documentation about core UI components. log A log is a message about a system used to understand the activity of the system and to diagnose problems. For more information on how we use log data, see Log management. Log monitoring Our log management and monitoring features give you the tools to collect, process, explore, visualize, and alert on your log data using your existing log forwarder. With all of your log data in one place, you'll be able to make better decisions, detect and resolve problems more quickly, and see your logs in context to troubleshoot faster. Logs Our Logs feature is a scalable log management platform that allows you to connect your log data with the rest of your telemetry data. Pre-built plugins with some of the most common open-source logging tools make it simple to send your data from anywhere to New Relic. Logs in context Logs in context makes it easy to link to your log data with related data across the rest of our platform. Bringing all of this data together in a single tool allows you to quickly get to the root cause of an issue and find the log lines that you need to identify and resolve a problem. master account See parent account. metric A metric is a numeric measurement. Metric data is a broad category because there are several ways to make and report measurements. For more about how metrics are reported at New Relic, see New Relic data types. metric timeslice New Relic reports metrics in several ways. One variety of metric data is called metric timeslice data; this is the type of data used to generate many of the charts in APM, mobile monitoring, and browser monitoring (for more details, see metric timeslice data). Over time, metric timeslice data is aggregated into longer timeslice data records for more efficient storage. For more about how we aggregate this type of data, see Data aggregation. For how to query this type of data, see Query metric timeslice data. metric grouping issue A metric grouping issue occurs when an account sends too many differently named metric timeslice data points to New Relic, and those individual web transactions are not properly aggregated. For example, rather than a single /user/controlpanel/ metric name, you might see /user/controlpanel/alice, /user/controlpanel/bob, and /user/controlpanel/carol. For more information, see Metric grouping issues. minion The software that accepts monitor jobs from a private location. A minion is a packaged virtual appliance that runs in your hypervisor. For more information, see Private locations overview and install and configure private minions. Mobile monitoring Mobile monitoring allows you to monitor and manage the performance of your mobile apps on Android, iOS, tvOS, and other systems. Mobile monitoring provides end-to-end details, including crashes, throughput, HTTP requests, error traces, and more. Not to be confused with New Relic's own mobile apps for Android, iPhone, and iPad. monitor For our Synthetic Monitoring, a monitor ensures your website or API endpoint is available. For more information, see Adding and editing monitors. NerdGraph NerdGraph is our GraphQL API, an efficient and flexible query language that lets you request exactly the data you need, without over-fetching or under-fetching. NerdGraph calls get all the data you need in a single request. NerdGraph also makes it easier to evolve APIs over time and enables powerful developer tools. You can use our NerdGraph GraphiQL explorer to explore the schema and find definitions. With valid New Relic API key, you can try it out yourself at api.newrelic.com/graphiql. Nerdlet A Nerdlet is a component of a New Relic One application. It's a specific UI view, represented by a React JavaScript package. For more information, see Nerdpack file structure. Nerdpack A Nerdpack is a component of a New Relic One application. It's the package containing all the files needed by that application. For more information, see Nerdpack file structure. New Relic Edge with Infinite Tracing New Relic Edge with Infinite Tracing is a fully managed, distributed tracing service that observes 100% of your application traces, then provides actionable data so you can solve issues faster. For more information, see /docs/understand-dependencies/distributed-tracing/get-started/how-new-relic-distributed-tracing-works. New Relic One For more information, see Introduction to New Relic One. New Relic One catalog Our catalog is a collection of applications built on the New Relic One platform. The catalog includes custom apps we've built, public open source apps, and any apps that you buid. You can browse the catalog on New Relic One. NRQL (New Relic query language) NRQL is a query language, similar in form to SQL, that allows you to query the data stored in your New Relic account. non-web transaction APM identifies transactions as either web or non-web. When New Relic does not detect a transaction was initiated by a web request, this is called a non-web transaction. For more information, see Background processes and other non-web transactions. notification The message sent when an incident opens, is acknowledged, or closes. The type of notification is defined by the alert policy's notification channel. For an explanation of how notifications relate to other basic alerts concepts, see Concepts and workflow. notification channel Where we send a notification when an incident opens, is acknowledged, or closes. Available channels include email, mobile push notifications, webhooks, and more. on-host integration On-host integrations refer to integrations that reside on your own servers or hosts and that communicate with our infrastructure agent. For more information, see Introduction to on-host integrations. owner For accounts on our original pricing model, this is a type of user role: the user who initially created the account. For more information, see Users. page load timing With page load timing, New Relic monitors the full load time for end-user browsers. New Relic's application agents dynamically inject JavaScript into the page, then capture the following key load points: Navigation start: The user initiates the transaction. First byte: The browser receives the requested page. DOM ready: The browser has finished parsing DOM. Page ready: Page loading is complete. Page load timing is sometimes referred to as RUM, or real user monitoring. Unlike standard RUM, page load timing also captures JavaScript errors and AJAX requests. For more information, see Page load timing process. parameter Deprecated term; see attribute. parent account New Relic organizations can have a parent/child account structure. This structure was much more important for organizations on our original user model, but is still used for some features for organizations on the New Relic One user model. Learn more about account structure. Parent accounts were previously referred to as \"master accounts\", and child accounts were previously referred to as \"sub-accounts\". permalink A unique URL that links to a view of your application at a specific point in time. Permalinks are useful for troubleshooting and for sharing interesting time windows with colleagues. pinger The component of New Relic that connects to your website to verify your website is accessible. New Relic has pingers in Europe, Asia, and the United States. Each pinger attempts to contact your website at least once every two minutes. If enough pingers are unable to reach your website, your application will be considered down. For in-depth scriptable testing, including real browser tests and tests of API endpoints, see Synthetic Monitoring. Synthetic Monitoring includes free ping monitoring, which allows you to monitor your website from locations around the world. For more information, see Types of Synthetic monitors. polling interval (AWS) Our Amazon integrations query your AWS services according to a polling interval, which varies depending on the integration. Each polling interval occurs for every AWS entity. For example, if you have thirteen Elastic Load Balancers (ELB), each one will be polled every five minutes. Depending on the AWS integration, there may be delays in the timing between the API request and the metric data returned. If you notice unusual delays, follow the integration troubleshooting procedures. PPM (pages per minute) The number of pages per minute your application serves. private location A Synthetic monitor feature that allows you to run Synthetic monitors from within your own systems by creating private minions. Private locations allow you to extend your Synthetic coverage to new geographical locations, and to monitor websites behind your firewall such as an intranet site. For more information, see Private locations overview. recovery period A recovery period of time begins when a data source enters a non-violating state after being in a violating state. The recovery period is set in the condition's threshold. A violation will close when a source remains in a non-violating state and the recovery period time has elapsed. If the data source enters a violating state before the time has elapsed, the recovery period clock will reset and the violation won't close. response time The duration of time between a request for service and a response. For more information, see Response time. restricted user A type of user role on a New Relic account. For more information, see Users. rollup Using the same application name for multiple applications. This allows you to combine data in APM, either from multiple applications, or from multiple instances of an application. For more information, see Rolling up app data. root span For distributed tracing, the root span is the first span in a trace. In many cases, the root span duration will represent the duration of the entire trace, or be very close to it. However, for more complex, modern systems that use a lot of asynchronous, non-blocking processes, this will not be true. For those systems, the root span’s duration may be significantly less than the duration of the trace. RPM The term RPM usually refers to the number of requests per minute your application receives from users. This is usually the same as CPM (calls per minute). Historically, some New Relic monitoring solutions, like APM and Browser Monitoring, used to contain RPM in the URL; for example, https://rpm.newrelic.com. This language use originally referred to Rails performance management because the first iteration of our product monitored Ruby on Rails applications. We monitor many more languages and systems than Ruby now. RUM (real user monitoring) See page load timing. runbook A runbook contains standard procedures and operations typically used by system administrators, network operations staff, and other personnel to handle outages, alert incidents, and other situations. If your organization stores runbook instructions as URLs, you can link this information to an alerts policy so your personnel has easy access to this information when an incident violates the defined policy thresholds. SAML (Security Assertion Markup Language) SAML is an XML-based data format for sharing authentication data between two parties. New Relic accounts must obtain a SAML certificate in order to enable Single Sign On for their users. For more information, see SAML service providers. Selenium Selenium is an open-source browser testing suite. Synthetics uses Selenium to test monitored websites with real browsers. For more information, see monitor types. service A service is a cluster of runtime server processes that accomplish a particular task, usually service requests. Unlike an application, a service is not usually invoked by a human. New Relic offers a variety of integrations that allow you to report data from your services. signal The stream of telemetry data that's watched and alerted on. You use NRQL queries to define a signal. signal filter When we receive data and it's routed to the streaming alerts platform, your NRQL WHERE clause will filter the data coming in. The filtered streaming data is what's evaluated for loss of signal violations, for example. span In a distributed trace, a span is a \"named, timed operation representing a contiguous segment of work in that trace\" (from OpenTracing.io definition). For distributed tracing, spans are displayed in the distributed tracing UI, and the data type Span is available to be queried. See also root span. SSL certificate SSL certificates encrypt data that is being transmitted. While New Relic refers to security certificates as SSL because it is a more commonly used term, all certificates adhere to industry standards for secure encryption in transit. SSO (single sign on) SSO (single sign on) allows you to manage user authentication in New Relic using an external SSO provider. For more information, see Setting up SSO. streaming algorithm This is what determines when the data in an aggregation window is processed. The streaming algorithm uses your server's clock time and the aggregation window size to trigger the alert evaluation process. sub-accounts See master account. Synthetic monitoring Synthetic monitoring allows you to monitor your website or API endpoint via automated, scriptable tools. Use free ping monitor to ensure your website is accessible, or expand your monitoring with browser monitors, which test your website with real browsers. Go further with scripting, to script browsers or API monitors for sophisticated testing. target A target is a resource or component monitored by a New Relic monitoring tool that has been identified in an alert condition. When the data source for that target crosses the defined critical threshold, we will open a violation. Depending on your policy's Incident preference setting, Alerts may create an incident record and send notifications through the defined channels. See also entity. tag Tags are key:value metadata added to monitored apps, hosts, dashboards, and other entities to help you organize your data at a high level. For details, see Tags. thresholds Thresholds are alert condition settings that define a violation. Threshold values include the value a data source must pass to trigger a violation and the time-related settings that define a violation; for example: Passing a certain value for at least x minutes Passing a certain value only once in x minutes While the data source passes a certain value, a degradation period starts. Likewise, when that data source stops passing a certain value, a recovery period starts. The durations of these two time periods are defined in the alert condition threshold settings. Thresholds have a required critical (red) threshold and an optional warning (yellow) threshold. In the UI, the entity's health status indicator will change to yellow or red when a threshold has been crossed and a violation will open. For more information, see Define thresholds. For an explanation of how thresholds relate to other basic Alerts concepts, see Concepts and workflow. throughput Throughput is a measurement of user activity for a monitored application. APM throughput and Browser Monitoring throughput are measured in different ways: APM: requests per minute (RPM) Browser: page views per minute (PPM) tier A tier can refer to how New Relic categorizes or visualizes the various agent language ecosystems that we support. For example: In APM, the color-coded categories that appear on your app's main Overview chart show response time spent in various functions, processes, or agents as tiers; for example, request queuing, garbage collection, Middleware, JVMs, etc. In New Relic labels, TIER can be used to define or classify the client-server architecture; for example, front-end and back-end tiers. \"Tier\" may sometimes be used to refer to our pricing editions. time picker By default the New Relic UI shows data for the past 30 minutes, ending now. To change the time window, use the time picker. time range A time range can refer to a length of time selected in the New Relic UI. New Relic displays a time range depending on the range you select using the time picker. timeslice data See metric timeslice data. trace A trace is a description of how a request travels through a system. Trace data helps you understand the performance of your system and diagnose problems. For more information on how we use trace data, see New Relic data types. traffic light See health status. transaction A transaction is defined as one logical unit of work in an application. This term primarily refers to server-side transactions monitored by APM. For more information, see documentation about web transactions and non-web transactions. The term transaction is also sometimes used in Browser Monitoring. In that case, it primarily refers to activity beginning with a browser-side web request and ending with a complete page load. transaction trace A transaction trace is a complete picture of a single transaction, down to the database queries and exact invocation patterns. With transaction traces, New Relic gives you much deeper visibility into a single slow transaction, which can help you understand a broader problem. For more information, see Transaction traces. UI The New Relic user interface. For more information, see Standard page functions. user A user can refer to a specific user role in a New Relic account. For more information, see Users. UTC Universal Time Coordinated (UTC), or Coordinated Universal Time, is a standard timestamp for synchronizing time around the world. value function (metrics) The numeric value obtained from metric timeslice data; for example, an average, minimum, maximum, total, sample size, etc. violation A violation occurs when the entity monitored by an alert condition reports a value that crosses the thresholds defined in that condition. For an explanation of how violations relate to other basic alerts concepts, see Concepts and workflow. You can view a summary of the violations for a selected incident's page. You can also view the violations for a specific entity from the product's UI. web external Web external is the term applied to the portion of time spent in transactions to external applications from within the code of the application you are monitoring. That time can be a call to a third party company (a payment provider, for example) or it could be a call to another microservice within your own company. Web external demonstrates how performance is impacted by your code executing outside the application you are measuring. web transaction A transaction is defined as one logical unit of work in an application. This term primarily refers to server-side transactions monitored by APM. Web transactions are initiated with an HTTP request. For most organizations, these represent customer-centric interactions and thus are the most important transactions to monitor. For more information, see Web transactions and Non-web transactions. WebDriverJS WebDriver is a Selenium component, used to control Synthetics scripted browsers. Specifically, Synthetics uses WebDriverJS, a Node.js-based flavor of Selenium. For more information, see Writing scripted browsers and Scripted browser examples. workload A workload represents a group of entities that work together to provide a digital service.

      "body": "APM provides service level agreement (SLA) reports. SLA reports help you better understand your application performance by showing application downtime and trends over time. SLA reports for an application only include web transactions. If your application creates only non-web transactions, New Relic does not produce SLA reports for that app. SLA reports can be viewed in APM or downloaded as comma-separated value (.csv) files. Depending on your account level's data retention policy, you can view daily, weekly, or monthly reports. Important On top of the standard APM SLA reports described in this document, New Relic has developed an advanced Service Levels management feature, with improved functionality. Check out our beta now! View SLA reports To view the SLA reports for your app: Go to one.newrelic.com > Applications > (select an app) > Reports > SLA. The report defaults to the Weekly SLA report tab. SLA report data shows the account owner's time zone, with periods beginning and ending at midnight in that time zone. If you have not enabled browser for your app, the SLA report shows links to requests, response time, and Apdex only for your application server. If you want to...

      "body": "Application performance monitoring (APM) is exactly what it sounds like: monitoring of your web or non-web application's performance. APM supports apps for several programming languages, including Go, Java, .NET, Node.js, PHP, Python, and Ruby, as well as a C SDK. View the status of all your services at a glance with APM. Tip This doc gives you detailed information about why APM matters to your business. But if you want to skip ahead, just sign up for a New Relic account. (It's free, forever!) Then, after you install the agent, you can start working with your data. Ready to get started? Start benefiting from APM in five simple steps (and just a few minutes!). Sign up for a New Relic account (it's free, forever!). Install and customize the language agent for your app. Generate some traffic for your app. Wait a few minutes for New Relic to start receiving your data. Log in to your account, and start exploring New Relic! Use the Explorer in New Relic One to access and observe the full stack of your software, including your apps, see performance data and alerting status at a glance, and check relationships. We provide you with a simple, yet powerful visual tool to monitor all your entities, that is, anything we can identify that reports data. In the New Relic ecosystem, entities include basic components like applications, hosts, containers, or database services, but it can also refer to custom groupings of such elements. You can also create your own entities. If data does not appear after waiting a few minutes, follow the troubleshooting tips for your APM agent. Identify problems before your users do Our APM agents report and store the state of your application so you can quickly identify potential problems before they affect your end users. With APM, your DevOps teams don't need to guess whether a performance blocker comes from the app itself, CPU availability, database loads, or something entirely unexpected. Use our APM solutions to gather both current and historical information about memory usage, CPU utilization, database query performance, web browser rendering performance, app availability, error analysis, external services, and other useful metrics. Monitor all aspects of your business Take advantage of these APM features, and more: Features Description App performance at a glance When you sign in to APM and select an app for your account, use the Summary page to quickly examine relationships across different aspects of your environment; for example: Web transactions response time: Where is the most time being spent? In the request queue, during different stages of page rendering and execution, from external services, or something else? Transaction traces: Which transactions are the slowest, and why? Error rate and throughput: What relationship is there between a spike in errors or slower throughput for a particular time period? Was there a deployment or outage at that time? Hosts: What kind of impact does this have on CPU usage, memory, etc.? Apdex: How are these events affecting customers' satisfaction with the site? Web and non-web transactions Start by comparing the top twenty web transactions or non-web transactions in terms of most time consuming, slowest average response time, highest throughput, or worst Apdex. From there, drill down into deeper trace levels for individual transactions, which in turn break down into smaller segments and components, from HTTPS requests on down to SQL queries. Want to explore even deeper? Set up distributed tracing to see how requests move across a distributed system. Select the transactions that are most important to your business (key transactions). APM and Infrastructure When your APM and Infrastructure accounts are linked, you will have access to APM data charts on these Infrastructure UI pages: Hosts, Network, Storage, and Processes. Distributed tracing Distributed tracing gives you visibility across distributed systems, showing you the path of a request as it travels between services. This feature is especially valuable for large, distributed systems that rely on many small services and microservices. Logs Bring your logs and application's data together to make troubleshooting easier and faster. With logs in context, you can see log messages related to your errors and traces directly in your app's UI. You can also see logs in context of your infrastructure data, such as Kubernetes clusters. No need to switch to another UI page in New Relic One. Service maps APM's service maps show your app's connections and dependencies, including databases and external services. Health indicators and performance metrics show you the current operational status for every part of your architecture. You can create and customize service maps to visualize and monitor your complex architectures. Query your data You can query and visualize your data: Sample and search APM transaction and error data to gain full understanding of the data being collected. Browse your data visually with the data explorer. Create custom SQL-like queries of your data using the New Relic Query Language (NRQL), or using our PromQL-style queries. Use dashboards to build advanced data visualizations, contextualize data, and understand what's going on in your system, real-time. These are just a few of APM's features.

If you're trying to switch between accounts, use the account switcher. account switcher If you have access to more than one account in a multi-account organization, you can use the account switcher to switch between accounts. This is located in the top right of most New Relic UI pages. For more on factors that affect access to accounts, see Factors affecting access. To find account settings, use the account dropdown. administrator A type of user role on a New Relic account. For more information, see Users. agent At New Relic, an agent is a piece of monitoring software that provides integrations with various technologies (for example, web frameworks, host operating systems, or database types). The agents send that data to New Relic, usually on a specific cadence. For more information, see: New Relic Instant Observability Install agents agent API Some New Relic agents have agent APIs that allow you to extend the functionality of an agent. You can use the API to control, customize and extend the functionality of the agent. Here are some agent API docs: APM agents: C SDK API Go agent API Java agent API .NET agent API Node.js agent API PHP agent API Ruby agent API Python agent API Browser agent: Browser agent API Mobile agents: iOS SDK API Android SDK API aggregated metrics Aggregated metric data summarizes calls to specific methods in your application, including how many times each one was called and response times. In the New Relic UI, you see the class and method names along with their aggregate numbers. Metric data aggregation depends on the New Relic tool and your subscription level. For more information, see the documentation about data retention. aggregation delay The length of time in seconds to wait for the aggregation window to fill with data. Required when using CADENCE or EVENT_FLOW aggreation_method types. aggregation function You can use NRQL query functions, such as sum(), average(), or latest() to choose how the data points in an aggregation window should be processed into a single data point. The single aggregated data point is what's passed through the alert evaluation process. aggregation method New Relic aggregates data into windows, and needs to determine when the current window ends and the next one begins. The aggregation_method is the logic that tells us when we have all the data for a given aggregation window. Once the window is closed, the data is aggregated into a single point and evaluated against the threshold. This field is optional. One of the following three values can be specified: EVENT_FLOW: (Default) Each aggregation window will wait until it starts to see timestamps arrive that are past its own delay setting. Once this occurs, the data is published. Relies on the timestamps of arriving data, so wall-clock time is no longer relevant. Works best for sources that come in frequently and with low event spread (high througput metrics) CADENCE: Classic New Relic logic where each evaluation window waits exactly as long as the aggregation_delay setting, using the wall-clock time as a timer. aggregation_delay is required when using this option. Data arriving too late will be dropped, which can cause false alerts. EVENT_TIMER: Each aggregation window has a timer on it, set to the aggregation_timer setting. The Timer starts running as soon as the first data point appears for that aggregation window (based on the data point’s timestamp). The aggregation_timer is reset for each new data point that arrives for that window. Once the aggregation_timer reaches 0, the aggregation window is published. Ideal for sparse and batched data, such as cloud integrations and infrequent error logs. aggregation timer The length of time in seconds to wait after each data point received, to ensure the entire batch is processed. Required when using EVENT_TIMER aggregation_method type. aggregation window Streaming alerts gathers data together into specific amounts of time. These windows of time are customizable. Data points are collected together based their timestamps and reported as a batch. The customizable aggregation window provides greater flexibility and fewer false violations when alerting on irregular or less frequent data points. alert An alert communicates an event or incident that designated personnel can track through Alerts. For an explanation of how basic alerts concepts are related, see Concepts and workflow. alert condition An alert condition (or condition), identified by its unique numeric condition_id, contains the criteria for creating a violation. The condition includes the threshold that is set for a metric timeslice or a custom metric over time on a chosen target. For an explanation of how a condition relates to other basic alerts concepts, see Concepts and workflow. alert evaluation Streaming data is assessed on a set of aggregation windows to determine if an alert condition is violating or recovering. The aggregation window time is how long we'll collect data before running the NRQL query condition. The offset evaluation time is how long you want us to wait for late data before assessing it. If a window doesn't have any data points, it's treated as a gap for loss of signal. alert policy A collection of one or more conditions, one or more notification channels, and an Incident preference setting. If a condition contained within the policy opens a violation, an incident may be opened depending on the Incident preference setting. Notifications will then be sent to all channels attached to the policy. For an explanation of how a policy relates to other basic alerts concepts, see Concepts and workflow. apdex Apdex is an industry-standard way to measure users' satisfaction with the response time of an application or service. New Relic rates each response as Satisfied, Tolerated, or Frustrated, and uses these ratings to calculate an overall user satisfaction score. For more information, see Apdex: Measure user satisfaction. apdex_f The response time above which a transaction are rated frustrating. Defaults to four times apdex_t. Requests that complete in less than apdex_t are rated satisfied. Requests that take longer than apdex_t, but less than four times apdex_t (apdex_f), are tolerated. Any requests that take longer than apdex_f are rated frustrating. For more information, see Apdex: Measure user satisfaction. apdex_t The response time above which a transaction is considered tolerable. The default value is 0.5 seconds, but you can change this in your Apdex settings. Requests that complete in less than apdex_t are rated satisfied. Requests that take more than apdex_t, but less than apdex_f, are tolerated. Any requests that take longer than apdex_f are rated frustrating. For more information, see Apdex: Measure user satisfaction. API (application programming interface) New Relic offers a variety of APIs and SDKs. For more information, see the introduction to New Relic's APIs. APM New Relic's APM (application performance monitoring) provides monitoring of your web or non-web application's performance. APM supports apps using several programming languages. application For New Relic purposes, any program instrumented by New Relic. application ID Some New Relic solutions assign a monitored application a unique application ID, often shortened to app ID. When present, this ID is available in the UI. It is also reported as an attribute and can be queried. For how to determine this, see Find app ID. application name The name that New Relic combines with your license key to uniquely identify a particular app. For more information, see Name your application. Applied Intelligence (AI) Applied Intelligence (AI) helps you find, troubleshoot, and resolve problems more quickly. Specifically, it’s a hybrid machine learning engine that reduces alert noise, correlates incidents, and automatically detects anomalies. Applied Intelligence includes Alerts, Incident Intelligence, and Proactive Detection. attribute Attributes are key-value pairs attached to data objects reported to New Relic. Attributes add detail, and they're similar to tags or labels in other SaaS software. You can explore this data by querying or searching via the UI or by using the data dictionary. Examples: APM reports a Transaction event. This includes timing data for the transaction in a duration attribute, which might have a value of .002. Our Infrastructure Monitoring reports a ProcessSample event. This includes a variety of CPU usage attributes, including a cpuSystemPercent attribute, which might have a value of .01. Our Telemetry SDK reports a Metric data type for storing metrics, with attached attributes like metricName and newrelic.source. Some New Relic tools allow you to report custom attributes to enhance your monitoring. For more information about attributes in APM, see Agent attributes. availability monitoring See Types of Synthetics monitors. browser The New Relic UI supports most browsers. For more information, see Supported browsers. For our end-user browser monitoring tool, see Browser Monitoring. Browser monitoring A Real User Monitoring (RUM) solution that measures the speed and performance of your end users as they navigate to your site from different web browsers, devices, operating systems, and networks. background external See web external. child account See parent account. cloud-based integration New Relic offers cloud-based integrations with providers such as Amazon Web Services (AWS), Microsoft Azure, and Google Cloud Platform. collector The component that collects data from New Relic agents running on an app server, mobile device, or end-user browser. While the agent is installed on a user's app server, the collectors are centrally located in New Relic's data center. In order to contact the collector, the agent must be able to reach New Relic's domains and IP addresses. (The exact domain or IP depends on the New Relic monitoring tool.) The collector receives and interprets this data, and stores it in a database. The data is then retrieved and presented in the New Relic UI and by our various REST APIs. Command line interface (CLI) Our command line interface (CLI) is a tool you can use to build a New Relic application. This is the same tool our own engineers use. Go here for quick start instructions. Go to our Developer site for sample apps and guides. compute unit (CU) A unit of measurement that determines your pricing for some New Relic products governed by our original product-based pricing model. For more information, see Compute unit pricing. condition_id See alert condition. CPM (calls per minute) The number of calls your application receives each minute. This usually corresponds to the number of page views or external connections, and is usually the same as RPM (requests per minute). CPU burn The time consumed by code minus the wait time for a transaction. This is the time actually spent processing the transaction. It appears in the New Relic UI at the top of the transaction view for the agents that provide it (Ruby and PHP only). custom attribute A key-value pair added to a transaction or event in order to gain additional information about it. For more information, see custom attributes. custom dashboard A customizable dashboard with charts and tables that includes data from multiple New Relic data sources. For more information, see dashboards. custom event An event, in New Relic terms, is a data object with attached attributes. New Relic reports default event types, like Transaction and TransactionError. You can also create your own events. Events can be queried, and are used in some other features. You can generate custom events with APM agents, the browser monitoring agent, the mobile monitoring agents, and via the Event API. Alternatively, you can add custom attributes to some existing default New Relic events. custom instrumentation Custom instrumentation allows you to extend New Relic's monitoring to instrument code elements New Relic doesn't automatically instrument. Custom instrumentation is useful when your framework is not supported by New Relic, or when New Relic fails to pick up some element of your program. You can also use custom instrumentation to block a transaction from being reported entirely. For more information, see Custom instrumentation. custom metric Metric timeslice data that is manually recorded via an API call. Custom metrics allow you to record arbitrary metrics; for example, timing or computer resource data. All custom metric names must be prefixed with Custom/. For more information, see Custom metrics. Not to be confused with custom instrumentation data. data collector See collector. data explorer Use the data explorer to access, query and customize your data, create visualizations, and make connections between your services in a consistent and curated experience. For more on using the data explorer, see Introduction to the data explorer. degradation period When a data source enters a violating state, a degradation period of time begins. The degradation period is set in the condition's threshold. A violation will open if the source stays in a violating state for the entire degradation period. In addition: If the data source enters a non-violating state before the entire time has elapsed, the degradation period countdown is reset, and a violation does not open. If your alert condition threshold is configured as at least once in, the degradation period always lasts a single minute. dimensional metric A dimensional metric is a metric that has multiple attributes, also known as dimensions. At New Relic, we report dimensional metrics using the Metric data type. For more on other metric data types, see Metric data. Docker An open platform for distributed applications, which allows you to assemble multi-container portable apps. Infrastructure Monitoring includes integrated Docker monitoring. For more information about Docker, see the Docker website. downtime The period of time when customers cannot access your site and your app is not reporting to New Relic. For more information, see Synthetic Monitoring and Types of synthetic monitors. entity In New Relic, an entity is anything we can identify that has data you can monitor. An entity can be something you monitor directly, like applications and microservices, or indirectly, like data centers. You can identify one or more entities to be targets for alert conditions. In the Alerts API, the entity being monitored is identified with an entity_id. For more on this, see What are entities? event The word event is a general term that can have many meanings. At New Relic, event can have several meanings: At New Relic, event data is one of our core data types. Event data represents a record of a single event at a particular moment in time. Events can vary by type (for example, Transaction or Mobile, and will have associated attributes (for example, timestamp or transactionName). For more details, see Event data. For our infrastructure monitoring, the word event can be used to refer to important system and host activity. For example, a configuration change for a monitored host would be registered on Infrastructure's Events UI page. For alerts, the Events UI page displays a list of alerts-related incidents for your monitored entities. Events are reported for a violation opening and for closing. In some contexts, event can refer to any NRQL-queryable data type. For example, when you run a NRQL query, you will see a count of inspected events: this refers to a count of all data types queried. expected error An expected error is a common error that you don't want to affect your Apdex score or error rate. For more information, see Manage errors in APM. exporter At New Relic, an exporter is a type of integration that reports telemetry data to New Relic from a third-party (non-New Relic) telemetry tool. For examples, see Exporters, or search our integration quickstarts in New Relic I/O. Flex New Relic Flex is an application-agnostic, all-in-one infrastructure integration. With it, you can build your own integration that collects metric data from a wide variety of services, and that can instrument any app that exposes metrics over a standard protocol (HTTP, file, shell) in a standard format (for example, JSON or plain text) to the terminal. It's a recommended way to create a custom integration, because it doesn't require coding skills. framework A framework is a structured collection of pre-defined functions, into which an application builder inserts their own code to build their application. A framework is not the same as a library. While a library is a collection of functions you can call as needed, a framework is a skeleton for your application. The functions in that framework then call your functions. For more about the distinction between a framework and a library, see What is the difference between a framework and a library?. New Relic automatically instruments many common frameworks. For more about the frameworks New Relic supports, see the agent-specific documentation: C SDK supported frameworks Go supported frameworks Java supported frameworks .NET supported frameworks Node.js supported frameworks PHP supported frameworks Python supported frameworks Ruby supported frameworks harvest cycle The period of time between each connection from a New Relic agent to the collector. Between harvest cycles, an agent collects and caches data. At the end of the cycle an agent reports those data to the collector, then begins a new harvest cycle. health status indicator Some New Relic UI pages have a health status indicator appearing next to an index of monitored entities. This is a colored bar (generally green, yellow, red, or gray) indicating the status of your app or other entity monitored by New Relic. It also indicates whether the entity has any alert policies assigned to it and whether there are any policy violations. In general, the colored bar will be green, yellow, red, or gray to indicate the health status. Exceptions: Our REST API (v2) uses orange instead of yellow for the application's health and reporting status. Service maps use different criteria for reporting the health of a connection between an app and an external service not monitored by New Relic (for example, a third party API). host At New Relic, a host means one of the following: A physical machine is a hardware-based device with dedicated physical resources, including memory, processing, and storage. Each machine has its own OS which applications run on. A virtual machine (VM) is the software implementation of a physical machine that executes programs like a physical machine. One or more virtual machines can run on a physical machine. Each virtual machine has its own OS and allocated virtual machine resources such as RAM and CPU. A cloud instance is a type of virtual machine that is run in the public cloud. In this context, virtual machines and cloud instances are different from Java Virtual Machines (JVMs) and containers. host ID Each host identified by APM is assigned a host ID. This ID is used to uniquely identify it, and to retrieve data about that host via the REST API. For more information, see List host ID. ignored error An error that you have told the APM agent not to report to the collector. For more information, see Manage errors in APM. incident An incident is a collection of one or more violations of the conditions defined in an alert policy. An incident record includes all of the open and close time stamps for each violation, as well as chart snapshots of the data being evaluated around the time of each violation. You can view detailed information from the Incidents pages in the user interface. You can also select your preference for how we roll up violations into the incident. For an explanation of how an incident relates to other basic alerts concepts, see Concepts and workflow. Infrastructure monitoring By connecting changes in host performance to changes in your configuration, infrastructure monitoring provides real-time metrics and powerful analytics that reduce your mean-time-to-resolution (MTTR). Infrastructure is specifically designed for complex environments that need flexible, dynamic server monitoring, from a physical datacenter to thousands of Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) instances and other types of integrations. Insights Insights was the name for the New Relic product that previously governed the reporting of custom events, as well as the ability to query and chart your New Relic data. These features are now a fundamental part of the New Relic One platform and are no longer governed by the Insights product or name. To learn more about these features: Event API for reporting custom events Query and chart data For historical reasons, the word \"Insights\" is still used in some places. For example: Some APM agents still have Insights language in their codebase. For example, the Java agent custom_insights_events configuration. For New Relic organizations on our original pricing model, Insights Pro is still the product name governing custom event data ingest and retention. There is an API key called the Insights insert key. instance ID Each instance identified by New Relic is assigned a unique instance ID. Instance IDs are most commonly found for JVMs (Java Virtual Machines), but can exist for each agent. This ID is used to uniquely identify it, and to retrieve data about that instance via the REST API. For more information, see List instance IDs. instrumentation The collection of data from an application or host. When New Relic instruments a framework, it detects the methods and calls used by that framework, and intelligently groups them together. integration At New Relic, an integration refers to a solution that integrates with a specific technology (like a web framework or a type of database). All our integrations can be found as quickstarts in New Relic Instant Observability. interaction In our mobile monitoring, an interaction is a specific code path initiated by a user interaction (usually a button press). An interaction is the mobile equivalent of a transaction, and like a transaction an interaction can be traced and monitored. You can see much of the data included in an interaction in the BrowserInteraction event. interaction trace An interaction trace is a complete picture of a single interaction. With interaction traces, New Relic gives you much deeper visibility into a single slow interaction, which can help you understand a broader problem. Interaction traces are the mobile equivalent of a transaction trace. For more information, see Creating interactions (iOS) and Creating interactions (Android). inventory data Inventory data is information about the status or configuration of a service or host. Examples of inventory data include: Configuration settings Name of the host the service is on Amazon AWS region Port being used For more information, see Understand and use data. key transaction A web transaction that the user has marked as particularly important; for example, key business events (such as signups or purchase confirmations), or transactions with a high performance impact (such as searches). Key transactions have their own pages in the UI and other customized values. For more information, see Key transactions. launcher A launcher is a specific piece of code you can include when you create a New Relic One app. It creates the tile on the homepage that you click to launch the app. For more information, see the documentation about core UI components. log A log is a message about a system used to understand the activity of the system and to diagnose problems. For more information on how we use log data, see Log management. Log monitoring Our log management and monitoring features give you the tools to collect, process, explore, visualize, and alert on your log data using your existing log forwarder. With all of your log data in one place, you'll be able to make better decisions, detect and resolve problems more quickly, and see your logs in context to troubleshoot faster. Logs Our Logs feature is a scalable log management platform that allows you to connect your log data with the rest of your telemetry data. Pre-built plugins with some of the most common open-source logging tools make it simple to send your data from anywhere to New Relic. Logs in context Logs in context makes it easy to link to your log data with related data across the rest of our platform. Bringing all of this data together in a single tool allows you to quickly get to the root cause of an issue and find the log lines that you need to identify and resolve a problem. master account See parent account. metric A metric is a numeric measurement. Metric data is a broad category because there are several ways to make and report measurements. For more about how metrics are reported at New Relic, see New Relic data types. metric timeslice New Relic reports metrics in several ways. One variety of metric data is called metric timeslice data; this is the type of data used to generate many of the charts in APM, mobile monitoring, and browser monitoring (for more details, see metric timeslice data). Over time, metric timeslice data is aggregated into longer timeslice data records for more efficient storage. For more about how we aggregate this type of data, see Data aggregation. For how to query this type of data, see Query metric timeslice data. metric grouping issue A metric grouping issue occurs when an account sends too many differently named metric timeslice data points to New Relic, and those individual web transactions are not properly aggregated. For example, rather than a single /user/controlpanel/ metric name, you might see /user/controlpanel/alice, /user/controlpanel/bob, and /user/controlpanel/carol. For more information, see Metric grouping issues. minion The software that accepts monitor jobs from a private location. A minion is a packaged virtual appliance that runs in your hypervisor. For more information, see Private locations overview and install and configure private minions. Mobile monitoring Mobile monitoring allows you to monitor and manage the performance of your mobile apps on Android, iOS, tvOS, and other systems. Mobile monitoring provides end-to-end details, including crashes, throughput, HTTP requests, error traces, and more. Not to be confused with New Relic's own mobile apps for Android, iPhone, and iPad. monitor For our Synthetic Monitoring, a monitor ensures your website or API endpoint is available. For more information, see Adding and editing monitors. NerdGraph NerdGraph is our GraphQL API, an efficient and flexible query language that lets you request exactly the data you need, without over-fetching or under-fetching. NerdGraph calls get all the data you need in a single request. NerdGraph also makes it easier to evolve APIs over time and enables powerful developer tools. You can use our NerdGraph GraphiQL explorer to explore the schema and find definitions. With valid New Relic API key, you can try it out yourself at api.newrelic.com/graphiql. Nerdlet A Nerdlet is a component of a New Relic One application. It's a specific UI view, represented by a React JavaScript package. For more information, see Nerdpack file structure. Nerdpack A Nerdpack is a component of a New Relic One application. It's the package containing all the files needed by that application. For more information, see Nerdpack file structure. New Relic Edge with Infinite Tracing New Relic Edge with Infinite Tracing is a fully managed, distributed tracing service that observes 100% of your application traces, then provides actionable data so you can solve issues faster. For more information, see /docs/understand-dependencies/distributed-tracing/get-started/how-new-relic-distributed-tracing-works. New Relic One For more information, see Introduction to New Relic One. New Relic One catalog Our catalog is a collection of applications built on the New Relic One platform. The catalog includes custom apps we've built, public open source apps, and any apps that you buid. You can browse the catalog on New Relic One. NRQL (New Relic query language) NRQL is a query language, similar in form to SQL, that allows you to query the data stored in your New Relic account. non-web transaction APM identifies transactions as either web or non-web. When New Relic does not detect a transaction was initiated by a web request, this is called a non-web transaction. For more information, see Background processes and other non-web transactions. notification The message sent when an incident opens, is acknowledged, or closes. The type of notification is defined by the alert policy's notification channel. For an explanation of how notifications relate to other basic alerts concepts, see Concepts and workflow. notification channel Where we send a notification when an incident opens, is acknowledged, or closes. Available channels include email, mobile push notifications, webhooks, and more. on-host integration On-host integrations refer to integrations that reside on your own servers or hosts and that communicate with our infrastructure agent. For more information, see Introduction to on-host integrations. owner For accounts on our original pricing model, this is a type of user role: the user who initially created the account. For more information, see Users. page load timing With page load timing, New Relic monitors the full load time for end-user browsers. New Relic's application agents dynamically inject JavaScript into the page, then capture the following key load points: Navigation start: The user initiates the transaction. First byte: The browser receives the requested page. DOM ready: The browser has finished parsing DOM. Page ready: Page loading is complete. Page load timing is sometimes referred to as RUM, or real user monitoring. Unlike standard RUM, page load timing also captures JavaScript errors and AJAX requests. For more information, see Page load timing process. parameter Deprecated term; see attribute. parent account New Relic organizations can have a parent/child account structure. This structure was much more important for organizations on our original user model, but is still used for some features for organizations on the New Relic One user model. Learn more about account structure. Parent accounts were previously referred to as \"master accounts\", and child accounts were previously referred to as \"sub-accounts\". permalink A unique URL that links to a view of your application at a specific point in time. Permalinks are useful for troubleshooting and for sharing interesting time windows with colleagues. pinger The component of New Relic that connects to your website to verify your website is accessible. New Relic has pingers in Europe, Asia, and the United States. Each pinger attempts to contact your website at least once every two minutes. If enough pingers are unable to reach your website, your application will be considered down. For in-depth scriptable testing, including real browser tests and tests of API endpoints, see Synthetic Monitoring. Synthetic Monitoring includes free ping monitoring, which allows you to monitor your website from locations around the world. For more information, see Types of Synthetic monitors. polling interval (AWS) Our Amazon integrations query your AWS services according to a polling interval, which varies depending on the integration. Each polling interval occurs for every AWS entity. For example, if you have thirteen Elastic Load Balancers (ELB), each one will be polled every five minutes. Depending on the AWS integration, there may be delays in the timing between the API request and the metric data returned. If you notice unusual delays, follow the integration troubleshooting procedures. PPM (pages per minute) The number of pages per minute your application serves. private location A Synthetic monitor feature that allows you to run Synthetic monitors from within your own systems by creating private minions. Private locations allow you to extend your Synthetic coverage to new geographical locations, and to monitor websites behind your firewall such as an intranet site. For more information, see Private locations overview. recovery period A recovery period of time begins when a data source enters a non-violating state after being in a violating state. The recovery period is set in the condition's threshold. A violation will close when a source remains in a non-violating state and the recovery period time has elapsed. If the data source enters a violating state before the time has elapsed, the recovery period clock will reset and the violation won't close. response time The duration of time between a request for service and a response. For more information, see Response time. restricted user A type of user role on a New Relic account. For more information, see Users. rollup Using the same application name for multiple applications. This allows you to combine data in APM, either from multiple applications, or from multiple instances of an application. For more information, see Rolling up app data. root span For distributed tracing, the root span is the first span in a trace. In many cases, the root span duration will represent the duration of the entire trace, or be very close to it. However, for more complex, modern systems that use a lot of asynchronous, non-blocking processes, this will not be true. For those systems, the root span’s duration may be significantly less than the duration of the trace. RPM The term RPM usually refers to the number of requests per minute your application receives from users. This is usually the same as CPM (calls per minute). Historically, some New Relic monitoring solutions, like APM and Browser Monitoring, used to contain RPM in the URL; for example, https://rpm.newrelic.com. This language use originally referred to Rails performance management because the first iteration of our product monitored Ruby on Rails applications. We monitor many more languages and systems than Ruby now. RUM (real user monitoring) See page load timing. runbook A runbook contains standard procedures and operations typically used by system administrators, network operations staff, and other personnel to handle outages, alert incidents, and other situations. If your organization stores runbook instructions as URLs, you can link this information to an alerts policy so your personnel has easy access to this information when an incident violates the defined policy thresholds. SAML (Security Assertion Markup Language) SAML is an XML-based data format for sharing authentication data between two parties. New Relic accounts must obtain a SAML certificate in order to enable Single Sign On for their users. For more information, see SAML service providers. Selenium Selenium is an open-source browser testing suite. Synthetics uses Selenium to test monitored websites with real browsers. For more information, see monitor types. service A service is a cluster of runtime server processes that accomplish a particular task, usually service requests. Unlike an application, a service is not usually invoked by a human. New Relic offers a variety of integrations that allow you to report data from your services. signal The stream of telemetry data that's watched and alerted on. You use NRQL queries to define a signal. signal filter When we receive data and it's routed to the streaming alerts platform, your NRQL WHERE clause will filter the data coming in. The filtered streaming data is what's evaluated for loss of signal violations, for example. span In a distributed trace, a span is a \"named, timed operation representing a contiguous segment of work in that trace\" (from OpenTracing.io definition). For distributed tracing, spans are displayed in the distributed tracing UI, and the data type Span is available to be queried. See also root span. SSL certificate SSL certificates encrypt data that is being transmitted. While New Relic refers to security certificates as SSL because it is a more commonly used term, all certificates adhere to industry standards for secure encryption in transit. SSO (single sign on) SSO (single sign on) allows you to manage user authentication in New Relic using an external SSO provider. For more information, see Setting up SSO. streaming algorithm This is what determines when the data in an aggregation window is processed. The streaming algorithm uses your server's clock time and the aggregation window size to trigger the alert evaluation process. sub-accounts See master account. Synthetic monitoring Synthetic monitoring allows you to monitor your website or API endpoint via automated, scriptable tools. Use free ping monitor to ensure your website is accessible, or expand your monitoring with browser monitors, which test your website with real browsers. Go further with scripting, to script browsers or API monitors for sophisticated testing. target A target is a resource or component monitored by a New Relic monitoring tool that has been identified in an alert condition. When the data source for that target crosses the defined critical threshold, we will open a violation. Depending on your policy's Incident preference setting, Alerts may create an incident record and send notifications through the defined channels. See also entity. tag Tags are key:value metadata added to monitored apps, hosts, dashboards, and other entities to help you organize your data at a high level. For details, see Tags. thresholds Thresholds are alert condition settings that define a violation. Threshold values include the value a data source must pass to trigger a violation and the time-related settings that define a violation; for example: Passing a certain value for at least x minutes Passing a certain value only once in x minutes While the data source passes a certain value, a degradation period starts. Likewise, when that data source stops passing a certain value, a recovery period starts. The durations of these two time periods are defined in the alert condition threshold settings. Thresholds have a required critical (red) threshold and an optional warning (yellow) threshold. In the UI, the entity's health status indicator will change to yellow or red when a threshold has been crossed and a violation will open. For more information, see Define thresholds. For an explanation of how thresholds relate to other basic Alerts concepts, see Concepts and workflow. throughput Throughput is a measurement of user activity for a monitored application. APM throughput and Browser Monitoring throughput are measured in different ways: APM: requests per minute (RPM) Browser: page views per minute (PPM) tier A tier can refer to how New Relic categorizes or visualizes the various agent language ecosystems that we support. For example: In APM, the color-coded categories that appear on your app's main Overview chart show response time spent in various functions, processes, or agents as tiers; for example, request queuing, garbage collection, Middleware, JVMs, etc. In New Relic labels, TIER can be used to define or classify the client-server architecture; for example, front-end and back-end tiers. \"Tier\" may sometimes be used to refer to our pricing editions. time picker By default the New Relic UI shows data for the past 30 minutes, ending now. To change the time window, use the time picker. time range A time range can refer to a length of time selected in the New Relic UI. New Relic displays a time range depending on the range you select using the time picker. timeslice data See metric timeslice data. trace A trace is a description of how a request travels through a system. Trace data helps you understand the performance of your system and diagnose problems. For more information on how we use trace data, see New Relic data types. traffic light See health status. transaction A transaction is defined as one logical unit of work in an application. This term primarily refers to server-side transactions monitored by APM. For more information, see documentation about web transactions and non-web transactions. The term transaction is also sometimes used in Browser Monitoring. In that case, it primarily refers to activity beginning with a browser-side web request and ending with a complete page load. transaction trace A transaction trace is a complete picture of a single transaction, down to the database queries and exact invocation patterns. With transaction traces, New Relic gives you much deeper visibility into a single slow transaction, which can help you understand a broader problem. For more information, see Transaction traces. UI The New Relic user interface. For more information, see Standard page functions. user A user can refer to a specific user role in a New Relic account. For more information, see Users. UTC Universal Time Coordinated (UTC), or Coordinated Universal Time, is a standard timestamp for synchronizing time around the world. value function (metrics) The numeric value obtained from metric timeslice data; for example, an average, minimum, maximum, total, sample size, etc. violation A violation occurs when the entity monitored by an alert condition reports a value that crosses the thresholds defined in that condition. For an explanation of how violations relate to other basic alerts concepts, see Concepts and workflow. You can view a summary of the violations for a selected incident's page. You can also view the violations for a specific entity from the product's UI. web external Web external is the term applied to the portion of time spent in transactions to external applications from within the code of the application you are monitoring. That time can be a call to a third party company (a payment provider, for example) or it could be a call to another microservice within your own company. Web external demonstrates how performance is impacted by your code executing outside the application you are measuring. web transaction A transaction is defined as one logical unit of work in an application. This term primarily refers to server-side transactions monitored by APM. Web transactions are initiated with an HTTP request. For most organizations, these represent customer-centric interactions and thus are the most important transactions to monitor. For more information, see Web transactions and Non-web transactions. WebDriverJS WebDriver is a Selenium component, used to control Synthetics scripted browsers. Specifically, Synthetics uses WebDriverJS, a Node.js-based flavor of Selenium. For more information, see Writing scripted browsers and Scripted browser examples. workload A workload represents a group of entities that work together to provide a digital service. For more information, see Workloads.",

      "body": "Application performance monitoring (APM) is exactly what it sounds like: monitoring of your web or non-web application's performance. APM supports apps for several programming languages, including Go, Java, .NET, Node.js, PHP, Python, and Ruby, as well as a C SDK. View the status of all your services at a glance with APM. Tip This doc gives you detailed information about why APM matters to your business. But if you want to skip ahead, just sign up for a New Relic account. (It's free, forever!) Then, after you install the agent, you can start working with your data. Ready to get started? Start benefiting from APM in five simple steps (and just a few minutes!). Sign up for a New Relic account (it's free, forever!). Install and customize the language agent for your app. Generate some traffic for your app. Wait a few minutes for New Relic to start receiving your data. Log in to your account, and start exploring New Relic! Use the Explorer in New Relic One to access and observe the full stack of your software, including your apps, see performance data and alerting status at a glance, and check relationships. We provide you with a simple, yet powerful visual tool to monitor all your entities, that is, anything we can identify that reports data. In the New Relic ecosystem, entities include basic components like applications, hosts, containers, or database services, but it can also refer to custom groupings of such elements. You can also create your own entities. If data does not appear after waiting a few minutes, follow the troubleshooting tips for your APM agent. Identify problems before your users do Our APM agents report and store the state of your application so you can quickly identify potential problems before they affect your end users. With APM, your DevOps teams don't need to guess whether a performance blocker comes from the app itself, CPU availability, database loads, or something entirely unexpected. Use our APM solutions to gather both current and historical information about memory usage, CPU utilization, database query performance, web browser rendering performance, app availability, error analysis, external services, and other useful metrics. Monitor all aspects of your business Take advantage of these APM features, and more: Features Description App performance at a glance When you sign in to APM and select an app for your account, use the Summary page to quickly examine relationships across different aspects of your environment; for example: Web transactions response time: Where is the most time being spent? In the request queue, during different stages of page rendering and execution, from external services, or something else? Transaction traces: Which transactions are the slowest, and why? Error rate and throughput: What relationship is there between a spike in errors or slower throughput for a particular time period? Was there a deployment or outage at that time? Hosts: What kind of impact does this have on CPU usage, memory, etc.? Apdex: How are these events affecting customers' satisfaction with the site? Web and non-web transactions Start by comparing the top twenty web transactions or non-web transactions in terms of most time consuming, slowest average response time, highest throughput, or worst Apdex. From there, drill down into deeper trace levels for individual transactions, which in turn break down into smaller segments and components, from HTTPS requests on down to SQL queries. Want to explore even deeper? Set up distributed tracing to see how requests move across a distributed system. Select the transactions that are most important to your business (key transactions). APM and Infrastructure When your APM and Infrastructure accounts are linked, you will have access to APM data charts on these Infrastructure UI pages: Hosts, Network, Storage, and Processes. Distributed tracing Distributed tracing gives you visibility across distributed systems, showing you the path of a request as it travels between services. This feature is especially valuable for large, distributed systems that rely on many small services and microservices. Logs Bring your logs and application's data together to make troubleshooting easier and faster. With logs in context, you can see log messages related to your errors and traces directly in your app's UI. You can also see logs in context of your infrastructure data, such as Kubernetes clusters. No need to switch to another UI page in New Relic One. Service maps APM's service maps show your app's connections and dependencies, including databases and external services. Health indicators and performance metrics show you the current operational status for every part of your architecture. You can create and customize service maps to visualize and monitor your complex architectures. Query your data You can query and visualize your data: Sample and search APM transaction and error data to gain full understanding of the data being collected. Browse your data visually with the data explorer. Create custom SQL-like queries of your data using the New Relic Query Language (NRQL), or using our PromQL-style queries. Use dashboards to build advanced data visualizations, contextualize data, and understand what's going on in your system, real-time. These are just a few of APM's features.

      "body": "Our Python agent monitors your Python application to help you identify and solve performance issues. You can also extend your performance monitoring to collect and analyze business data to help you improve the customer experience and make data-driven business decisions. With flexible options for custom instrumentation and APIs, The Python agent offers multiple building blocks to customize the data you need from your app. Our Python works with a wide variety of web frameworks and hosting mechanisms, including Django, Gunicorn, WSGI, CherryPy, uWSGI, and more. You can also install the Python agent in a Google App Engine flexible environment. Monitor app performance After you install the Python agent, it begins to collect data about your app. You can view the data as charts and tables in New Relic One. View the big picture of your app. Monitor your app's Apdex (user satisfaction). Get a high-level summary of your app with Summary page. Enable distributed tracing to see activity across an architecture having many services. Install Infrastructure monitoring and view detailed server/host data for your app. Find errors and problems quickly. Track key transactions specific to your business. Create custom dashboards for important metrics. Alert your team when an error or problem occurs before it affects your users. View performance after a deployment. Drill down into performance details. Examine code-level transaction traces. Examine database query traces. Examine error traces. Use thread profiler sessions to see detailed stack traces of sampled threads View logs for your APM and infrastructure data Bring your logs and application's data together to make troubleshooting easier and faster. No need to switch to another UI page in New Relic One. With logs in context, you can see log messages related to your errors and traces directly in your app's UI. You can also see logs in context of your infrastructure data, such as Kubernetes clusters. Extend agent instrumentation Other helpful tools include: Tools Description Browser monitoring Integrate the Python agent with browser monitoring to gain visibility into end-user browser activity. Simple scripts and background tasks Monitor job-based or task queuing systems, like Celery, or other standalone non-web functions. Business data analysis with data exploration. Use the Python agent with our data explorer to organize, query, and visualize your data to answer key questions about application performance and customer experience. Use default transaction attributes, or add your own. Query your data using the New Relic Query Language (NRQL). Send your own event data. Create and share customizable, interactive dashboards. Install the Python agent Before you install the Python agent, make sure your system meets the system requirements. You must also create a New Relic account. We support a number of web frameworks and libraries right out of the box, including Django, WSGI, and Gunicorn. If you use one of the supported web frameworks, installation is easy. If you use an unsupported framework, the process will involve some additions to your app code and/or web server files. For a quick and simple install process that will work for the majority of setups, follow these simple steps: Download and install the Python package. Create config file. Integrate the Python agent with your application. Read the Quick Start guide Add Python data Monitor non-web scripts, background tasks, and functions The Python agent also lets you monitor non-web scripts, worker processes, tasks, and functions. The installation process for these non-web transactions is similar to the one used for a web app, with one major difference: instead of going through the standard integration process described in the install instructions, you would manually \"wrap\" any function you want to monitor. For more information, see Non-web tasks and processes. For instructions on monitoring Celery tasks, see Celery background tasks. What's next after installation? Once you get the agent up and running, some suggested next steps are: Explore your data in and get comfortable with the user interface. Read our docs on our other observability solutions and the APM page. Change your application's name, or other configuration options. Learn about setting up custom instrumentation for application activity not monitored by default. Consider the Python Telemetry SDK. Troubleshooting After you complete the install process, your data should appear in the APM UI within five minutes. If it does not, use these troubleshooting resources: If no data appears, follow these troubleshooting steps. If you experience issues when installing or running the Python agent on a new host, test that the package is installed correctly and that it can contact New Relic's data collector service. For other problems, see the full list of troubleshooting documentation. Check the source code The Python agent is open source software. That means you can browse its source code and send improvements, or create your own fork and build it. For more information, see the README.",

Extend agent instrumentation Other helpful tools include: Tools Description Browser monitoring Integrate the Python agent with browser monitoring to gain visibility into end-user browser activity. Simple scripts and background tasks Monitor job-based or task queuing systems, like Celery, or other standalone non-web functions. Business data analysis with data exploration. Use the Python agent with our data explorer to organize, query, and visualize your data to answer key questions about application performance and customer experience. Use default transaction attributes, or add your own. Query your data using the New Relic Query Language (NRQL). Send your own event data. Create and share customizable, interactive dashboards. Install the Python agent Before you install the Python agent, make sure your system meets the system requirements. You must also create a New Relic account. We support a number of web frameworks and libraries right out of the box, including Django, WSGI, and Gunicorn. If you use one of the supported web frameworks, installation is easy. If you use an unsupported framework, the process will involve some additions to your app code and/or web server files. For a quick and simple install process that will work for the majority of setups, follow these simple steps: Download and install the Python package. Create config file. Integrate the Python agent with your application. Read the Quick Start guide Add Python data Monitor non-web scripts, background tasks, and functions The Python agent also lets you monitor non-web scripts, worker processes, tasks, and functions. The installation process for these non-web transactions is similar to the one used for a web app, with one major difference: instead of going through the standard integration process described in the install instructions, you would manually \"wrap\" any function you want to monitor. For more information, see Non-web tasks and processes. For instructions on monitoring Celery tasks, see Celery background tasks. What's next after installation? Once you get the agent up and running, some suggested next steps are: Explore your data in and get comfortable with the user interface. Read our docs on our other observability solutions and the APM page. Change your application's name, or other configuration options. Learn about setting up custom instrumentation for application activity not monitored by default. Consider the Python Telemetry SDK. Troubleshooting After you complete the install process, your data should appear in the APM UI within five minutes. If it does not, use these troubleshooting resources: If no data appears, follow these troubleshooting steps. If you experience issues when installing or running the Python agent on a new host, test that the package is installed correctly and that it can contact New Relic's data collector service. For other problems, see the full list of troubleshooting documentation. Check the source code The Python agent is open source software. That means you can browse its source code and send improvements, or create your own fork and build it. For more information, see the README.",

      "body": "New Relic for Go monitors your Go language applications and microservices to help you identify and solve performance issues. You can also use your data to improve your customers' experience and make data-driven business decisions. Go is a compiled language, and doesn’t use a virtual machine. The best way to monitor Go applications is to use the Go API. Our API provides exceptional flexibility and control over what gets instrumented. Get New Relic for Go in a few simple steps. Monitor application and microservice performance The Go programming language, also called Golang, has become a popular coding choice for its ease of use, concurrency, and impressive speed. With New Relic for Go, you will gain a new level of visibility into your Golang applications: See the big picture: Monitor the throughput, response times, and errors of the transactions in your applications and services. Understand your application's runtime health by seeing memory usage, garbage collection behavior, and CPU usage over time. With deployment markers, see how code changes impact application performance and health. Use infrastructure monitoring to view detailed host and server data. Use distributed tracing to understand how your services and microservices are interacting. Identify and fix errors: Find bottlenecks by seeing time spent on database calls, external system calls, and key blocks of code. View Goroutine counts and identify possible Goroutine leaks. Get alerts for problems or errors before they affect users. Create custom dashboards for important metrics. View logs for your APM and infrastructure data: You can bring your logs and application's data together to make troubleshooting easier and faster. No need to switch to another UI page in New Relic One. With logs in context, you can see log messages related to your errors and traces directly in your app's UI. You can also see logs in context of your infrastructure data, such as Kubernetes clusters. Analyze business data: Query user-related data and improve business processes. Create custom queries of your Go application data. Send your own custom data to New Relic. Create and share visual, interactive displays of your data. Get New Relic for Go To use New Relic for Go: Check the compatibility and requirements. If you do not already have one, sign up for a free New Relic account. To install the agent, use our launcher, or follow the New Relic Go agent's installation and instrumentation procedures. Wait a few minutes to view data from your Go app in your New Relic account's UI. Read the install docs Add Go data We recommend instrumenting your Go code to get the maximum benefits from the New Relic Go agent. But we make it easy to get great data in couple of ways: Simply import the agent and create an application to get useful runtime information about your number of goroutines, garbage collection statistics, and memory and CPU usage. Use our many integration packages for out-of-the box support for many popular Go web frameworks and libraries. We continue to add integration packages based on your feedback. You can weigh in on potential integrations on the Explorers Hub and our New Relic Go agent GitHub project.

      "body": "Application performance monitoring (APM) is exactly what it sounds like: monitoring of your web or non-web application's performance. APM supports apps for several programming languages, including Go, Java, .NET, Node.js, PHP, Python, and Ruby, as well as a C SDK. View the status of all your services at a glance with APM. Tip This doc gives you detailed information about why APM matters to your business. But if you want to skip ahead, just sign up for a New Relic account. (It's free, forever!) Then, after you install the agent, you can start working with your data. Ready to get started? Start benefiting from APM in five simple steps (and just a few minutes!). Sign up for a New Relic account (it's free, forever!). Install and customize the language agent for your app. Generate some traffic for your app. Wait a few minutes for New Relic to start receiving your data. Log in to your account, and start exploring New Relic! Use the Explorer in New Relic One to access and observe the full stack of your software, including your apps, see performance data and alerting status at a glance, and check relationships. We provide you with a simple, yet powerful visual tool to monitor all your entities, that is, anything we can identify that reports data. In the New Relic ecosystem, entities include basic components like applications, hosts, containers, or database services, but it can also refer to custom groupings of such elements. You can also create your own entities. If data does not appear after waiting a few minutes, follow the troubleshooting tips for your APM agent. Identify problems before your users do Our APM agents report and store the state of your application so you can quickly identify potential problems before they affect your end users. With APM, your DevOps teams don't need to guess whether a performance blocker comes from the app itself, CPU availability, database loads, or something entirely unexpected. Use our APM solutions to gather both current and historical information about memory usage, CPU utilization, database query performance, web browser rendering performance, app availability, error analysis, external services, and other useful metrics. Monitor all aspects of your business Take advantage of these APM features, and more: Features Description App performance at a glance When you sign in to APM and select an app for your account, use the Summary page to quickly examine relationships across different aspects of your environment; for example: Web transactions response time: Where is the most time being spent? In the request queue, during different stages of page rendering and execution, from external services, or something else? Transaction traces: Which transactions are the slowest, and why? Error rate and throughput: What relationship is there between a spike in errors or slower throughput for a particular time period? Was there a deployment or outage at that time? Hosts: What kind of impact does this have on CPU usage, memory, etc.? Apdex: How are these events affecting customers' satisfaction with the site? Web and non-web transactions Start by comparing the top twenty web transactions or non-web transactions in terms of most time consuming, slowest average response time, highest throughput, or worst Apdex. From there, drill down into deeper trace levels for individual transactions, which in turn break down into smaller segments and components, from HTTPS requests on down to SQL queries. Want to explore even deeper? Set up distributed tracing to see how requests move across a distributed system. Select the transactions that are most important to your business (key transactions). APM and Infrastructure When your APM and Infrastructure accounts are linked, you will have access to APM data charts on these Infrastructure UI pages: Hosts, Network, Storage, and Processes. Distributed tracing Distributed tracing gives you visibility across distributed systems, showing you the path of a request as it travels between services. This feature is especially valuable for large, distributed systems that rely on many small services and microservices. Logs Bring your logs and application's data together to make troubleshooting easier and faster. With logs in context, you can see log messages related to your errors and traces directly in your app's UI. You can also see logs in context of your infrastructure data, such as Kubernetes clusters. No need to switch to another UI page in New Relic One. Service maps APM's service maps show your app's connections and dependencies, including databases and external services. Health indicators and performance metrics show you the current operational status for every part of your architecture. You can create and customize service maps to visualize and monitor your complex architectures. Query your data You can query and visualize your data: Sample and search APM transaction and error data to gain full understanding of the data being collected. Browse your data visually with the data explorer. Create custom SQL-like queries of your data using the New Relic Query Language (NRQL), or using our PromQL-style queries. Use dashboards to build advanced data visualizations, contextualize data, and understand what's going on in your system, real-time. These are just a few of APM's features.

For a quick and simple install process that will work for the majority of setups, follow these simple steps: Download and install the Python package. Create config file. Integrate the Python agent with your application. Read the Quick Start guide Add Python data Monitor non-web scripts, background tasks, and functions The Python agent also lets you monitor non-web scripts, worker processes, tasks, and functions. The installation process for these non-web transactions is similar to the one used for a web app, with one major difference: instead of going through the standard integration process described in the install instructions, you would manually \"wrap\" any function you want to monitor. For more information, see Non-web tasks and processes. For instructions on monitoring Celery tasks, see Celery background tasks. What's next after installation? Once you get the agent up and running, some suggested next steps are: Explore your data in and get comfortable with the user interface. Read our docs on our other observability solutions and the APM page. Change your application's name, or other configuration options. Learn about setting up custom instrumentation for application activity not monitored by default. Consider the Python Telemetry SDK. Troubleshooting After you complete the install process, your data should appear in the APM UI within five minutes. If it does not, use these troubleshooting resources: If no data appears, follow these troubleshooting steps. If you experience issues when installing or running the Python agent on a new host, test that the package is installed correctly and that it can contact New Relic's data collector service. For other problems, see the full list of troubleshooting documentation. Check the source code The Python agent is open source software. That means you can browse its source code and send improvements, or create your own fork and build it. For more information, see the README.",

      "body": "Deploying an app can be a risky event—when your app breaks, a bad deployment is often the cause. New Relic allows you to track deployments so you can correlate deploy to your app's performance. Tracking deployments creates deployment markers that appear in APM charts. See how deployment markers work in this short video (4:30 minutes): Options for tracking deployments You can use the New Relic REST API v2 to record new deployments, retrieve a list of past deployments, and delete past deployments on your APM application. In addition, some APM agents have agent-specific methods to record deployments automatically. You can use your Slack integration with New Relic, or a simple webhook, to notify your team in real time of deployments for applications monitored by APM. Slack provides a webhook URL that allows you to post generic JSON that will appear formatted in a chosen Slack channel. There are a few places where you can view deployments in the New Relic UI after they have been recorded. You can view deployments in the UI: In the activity feed of the APM Summary, New Relic One Service summary, and entity summary pages. On APM performance charts as a chart marker. On the Deployments page for summary performance. Tip Deployment markers are not available for browser applications, but see browser releases for a way to tag errors with release versions. Record deployments with the REST API You can use the New Relic REST API v2 to record deployments, get a list of past deployments, and delete deployments. The examples in this document use curl as a command line tool. However, you can use any method to make your REST requests. You can also create, view, and delete deployments with the API Explorer. JSON uses double quotes \" for element names and content. Using single quotes ' will cause errors. Record a deployment with POST To record a new deployment, send a POST request that includes your API key to the deployments endpoint. Attach the payload in JSON format (see Character limits and JSON parameters). All payload parameters are optional except revision. For example: curl -X POST \"https://api.newrelic.com/v2/applications/$APP_ID/deployments.json\" \\ -H \"Api-Key:$API_KEY\" \\ -i \\ -H \"Content-Type: application/json\" \\ -d \\ '{ \"deployment\": { \"revision\": \"REVISION\", \"changelog\": \"Added: /v2/deployments.rb, Removed: None\", \"description\": \"Added a deployments resource to the v2 API\", \"user\": \"datanerd@example.com\", \"timestamp\": \"2019-10-08T00:15:36Z\" } }' Copy Record a deployment with PowerShell To record a deployment with PowerShell, send a POST request that includes your API key to the deployments endpoint. Attach the payload in JSON format (see Character limits and JSON parameters). All payload parameters are optional except revision. This example uses PowerShell version 3 or higher: Invoke-WebRequest -Uri https://api.newrelic.com/v2/applications/YOUR_APP_ID/deployments.json -Method POST -Headers @{'Api-Key'='$API_KEY'} -ContentType 'application/json' -Body '{ \"deployment\": { \"revision\": \"REVISION\", \"changelog\": \"Added: /v2/deployments.rb, Removed: None\", \"description\": \"Added a deployments resource to the v2 API\", \"user\": \"datanerd@example.com\", \"timestamp\": \"2019-10-08T00:15:36Z\" } }' Copy This example uses PowerShell version 2 (requires .NET framework 3.5 or higher): $encoding = [System.Text.Encoding]::GetEncoding(\"ASCII\") $data ='{ \"deployment\": { \"revision\": \"REVISION\", \"changelog\": \"Added: /v2/deployments.rb, Removed: None\", \"description\": \"Added a deployments resource to the v2 API\", \"user\": \"datanerd@example.com\", \"timestamp\": \"2019-10-08T00:15:36Z\" } }' $postData = $encoding.GetBytes($data) $request = [System.Net.WebRequest]::Create('https://api.newrelic.com/v2/applications/$APP_ID/deployments.json') $request.Method = 'POST' $request.Headers.add('Api-Key','$API_KEY') $request.ContentType='application/json' $stream = $request.GetRequestStream() $stream.Write($postData,0,$postData.Length) $request.GetResponse() Copy View a list of deployments with GET To retrieve a list of all past deployments for your app, send a GET request that includes your API key to the deployments endpoint. GET requests do not use a JSON payload. For example: curl -X GET \"https://api.newrelic.com/v2/applications/$APP_ID/deployments.json\" \\ -H \"Api-Key:$API_KEY\" \\ -i Copy Sample output from GET This example requests a list of deployments for app ID 9999999: curl -X GET \"https://api.newrelic.com/v2/applications/9999999/deployments.json\" \\ -H \"Api-Key:ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXabcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwx\" \\ -i Copy The API returns this list of deployments: HTTP/1.1 200 OK ETag: \"ABCDEFGHIJKabcdefghijk0123456789\" Cache-Control: max-age=0, private, must-revalidate Content-Type: application/json { \"deployments\": [ { \"id\": 1234567, \"revision\": \"1234123412341234123412341234123412341234\", \"changelog\": \"Fixed the bugs for real this time\", \"description\": \"Example description two\", \"user\": \"Data Nerd\", \"timestamp\": \"2016-02-24T10:09:27-08:00\", \"links\": { \"application\": 9999999 } }, { \"id\": 2345678, \"revision\": \"7890789078907890789078907890789078907890\", \"changelog\": \"Think I fixed all the bugs\", \"description\": null, \"user\": \"Dren Atad\", \"timestamp\": \"2014-10-22T12:23:47-07:00\", \"links\": { \"application\": 9999999 } } ], \"links\": { \"deployment.agent\": \"/v2/applications/{application_id}\" } } Copy Delete a deployment with DELETE To delete a deployment, send a DELETE request that includes your API key to the deployments endpoint. DELETE requests do not use a JSON payload, but you must specify the ID for the deployment you want to delete. To retrieve the ID for a deployment, use the GET request. For example: curl -X DELETE \"https://api.newrelic.com/v2/applications/$APP_ID/deployments/$DEPLOYMENT_ID.json\" \\ -H \"Api-Key:$API_KEY\" \\ -i Copy Character limits and JSON parameters The JSON payload can include the following parameters. Important UTF-8 4 byte characters, such as Emojis and some non-Latin language glyphs, cannot be used in the deployment text. Parameter Data type Description revision String, 127 character maximum Required. A unique ID for this deployment, visible in the Summary page and on the Deployments page. Can be any string, but is usually a version number or a Git checksum. changelog String, 65535 character maximum Optional. A summary of what changed in this deployment, visible in the Deployments page when you select (selected deployment) > Change log. description String, 65535 character maximum Optional. A high-level description of this deployment, visible in the Summary page and on the Deployments page when you select an individual deployment. user String, 31 character maximum Optional. A username to associate with the deployment, visible in the Summary page and on the Deployments page. timestamp ISO 8601 Optional. When the deployment occurred, down to the second. If not specified, the deployment will be recorded at the time when the API call was received. Timestamp requirements: Must be in UTC time. Must be after the most recent deployment timestamp. Cannot be in the future. Must be in ISO8601 format; for example, \"2019-10-08T00:15:36Z\". Record deployments using the New Relic agent Some agents have additional methods to record deployments: All agents: Use the New Relic REST API v2. C: No SDK-specific methods. Use the REST API. Go: No agent-specific methods. Use the REST API. Java: Call the Java agent jar. .NET: Use PowerShell and the REST API. Node.js: No agent-specific methods. Use the REST API. PHP: Use a PHP script. Python: Use the record-deploy subcommand of the newrelic-admin script. Ruby: Use a Capistrano recipe. Notify your team of deployments After a deployment is recorded using the REST API, you can optionally notify a webhook endpoint of the deployment. The destination of the webhook can be your Slack instance. To use webhooks to set up a deployment notification for a Slack channel: Log in to your Slack account as an admin, then go to App directory > Manage > Apps. Search for your New Relic app, then select Add configuration. From Post to channel, select an existing Slack channel or add a new channel, then Add configuration. From the list of options, copy the webhook URL. Go to one.newrelic.com > (account dropdown) > Account settings > Integrations > Deploy notifications > Webhook. Paste the Slack webhook URL, then save. Optional: Send a test message. Tip You can also use webhooks, Slack channels, and other options for alert notifications with New Relic Alerts. End of life notification: Hipchat, Campfire As of September 9, 2019, integrations with Hipchat and Campfire for APM deployment notifications will no longer be available. Recommendation: If you are still using Hipchat or Campfire, use webhooks with Slack channels instead. For more information, see the New Relic Explorers Hub post.",

      "body": "Applications are automatically removed from New Relic after 93 days without sending data to our platform. You can also remove an application using the UI, once it has stopped sending data. Key metrics will continue to be available via the New Relic REST API, with the application name remaining reserved. For more information, see Inactive apps in New Relic One and our data retention guidelines. Before attempting to remove an app Before attempting to remove an app monitored by New Relic APM, browser monitoring, or mobile monitoring from the UI, keep in mind: You can downgrade your account to pay less or make it entirely free. The ability to remove an app from the UI may be dependent on permissions. If an agent is still sending data from an app, you cannot remove that app. Remove an application from New Relic Before you can remove an application monitored by New Relic APM, browser monitoring, or mobile monitoring, the app must first stop reporting data. Do this by disabling the agent (explained below) or by uninstalling the agent completely. APM applications Disable an APM agent using these instructions: C SDK: Do a quick recompile and deploy. For example, surround your instrumentation in #ifdef, and set the value of YOURNAMESPACE_NEWRELIC_ENABLED with your build system. Go: Set Enabled to false. Java: Set agent_enabled to false. .NET: Set Newrelic.AgentEnabled to false. Node.js: Set agent_enabled to false. PHP: Remove or disable both the newrelic.so and newrelic-daemon components. Set newrelic.enabled to false. Python: Set monitor_mode to false. Ruby: Set agent_enabled to false. Restart the application server and wait up to ten minutes. Verify the color-coded health status for the app has turned to gray and is no longer reporting data. To remove the APM application from the UI (and any associated apps in browser monitoring), you have a few options: Delete the app from the UI. Go to one.newrelic.com > APM > (select an app/service) > Settings > Application, and click the Delete application button. Use NerdGraph to delete an entity. If you've done the above and are still seeing that app in the UI, you can use NerdGraph to delete the relevant entities. For how to find entity IDs, see Entities. Browser If you've used the copy/paste method to install the browser agent, remove the JavaScript snippet from your application's pages. After 93 days, that app will be removed from the UI. If you want to remove it sooner than that, you have several options: Delete an associated APM app. If your browser app is linked to an APM application, deleting the APM application also removes the browser application. See the instructions for deleting an APM app. Delete it from the UI. Go to one.newrelic.com > Browser > (select an app) > Settings > Application settings, and click the Delete application button. Use NerdGraph to delete an entity. If you've done the above and are still seeing that app in the UI, you can use NerdGraph to delete the relevant entities. For how to find entity IDs, see Entities. Mobile Remove all references/dependencies to New Relic's mobile monitoring SDK/frameworks, then rebuild the application. For more information, see the iOS and Android install docs. After 93 days, the app will be removed from the UI. If you want to remove it sooner than that, you have several options: Remove it using the UI. Go to one.newrelic.com > Mobile > (select an app) > Settings > Application, and click Delete application. Use NerdGraph to delete an entity. If you've done the above and are still seeing that app in the UI, you can use NerdGraph to delete the relevant entities. For how to find entity IDs, see Entities. Troubleshooting If you have problems removing an app, here are some possible causes and suggested solutions: You lack permissions If you don't have relevant permissions, you won't be able to remove an application. You have not waited long enough All app data must stop reporting to New Relic before you can remove that entity from New Relic. In most cases, this takes between 10-15 minutes. In rare cases, it can take a few minutes longer. Not all agents are disabled If you have multiple agents reporting data under the same UI name, then you must make sure you disable or uninstall all of the agents associated with that entity. You have problems removing your PHP app If you have a PHP app and aren't able to remove it from the UI, possible causes include: You have not disabled both components of the PHP agent. You must stop or uninstall both newrelic.so and newrelic-daemon in order to be able to remove a PHP app. For more information, see New Relic daemon processes. You have set up per-directory monitoring of your PHP app, and unexpected PHP data is reporting as the default PHP application in the New Relic UI. To fix this, change the default app name in the PHP agent config. You don't know where the app's data is coming from If you don't know where an app's data is coming from, it may be because the app's name has been changed. When an app name is changed in the UI, it does not change the underlying app name being reported; it only changes how the app name appears in the UI. To see if there is a difference between the reported name and the displayed name: From one.newrelic.com, select APM, then select an application. Scroll down to Settings and select Application. Compare the name in the Application alias field to the name in the Your application still reports as message directly beneath it. To get host information about an app you are not familiar with: From one.newrelic.com, select APM, then select an application. From the summary view, review the Servers list. Once you have identified where app data is coming from, you can remove the app from New Relic. Browser data is still reporting To remove an app from New Relic, all data must have stopped reporting, including browser monitoring data. To verify that you have disabled or uninstalled the APM agent associated with the app: Ensure that browser monitoring is disabled. If your browser monitoring script is inserted by the APM agent, turn it off from inside the UI, in the agent's config file, or in both. If you copied and pasted the monitoring JavaScript snippet in certain pages, remove that JavaScript snippet manually. Ensure all caches have been cleared that the application uses, such as host caches, CDNs, or anything else that caches built pages. Optional: To see a count of how many page views report from each domain, use this NRQL query: SELECT count(*) FROM PageView WHERE appName = 'YOUR_BROWSER_APP_NAME' FACET domain Copy If these steps don't resolve the issue, it is likely due to an end-user's browser cache that hasn't yet cleared. Wait until those caches clear. If your app has internal users, you may be able to identify the users and clear those caches.",

For additional chart options, select the dropdown for any chart. CPU %: On the System tab, CPU Percent is a derived metric that is part of the SystemSample event. The CPU percentage is not collected by New Relic, but derived from several other metrics. Specifically, the cpuPercent attribute is an aggregation of cpuUserPercent, cpuSystemPercent, cpuIoWaitPercent and cpuStealPercent. Load average five minute: represents an average of the number of tasks waiting to do work on a system over the last 5 minutes. Memory free %: compares the amount of free memory bytes to the amount of used memory bytes. For explanations of different chart metrics, see Default infrastructure attributes and events. Functions for adjusting chart data include: Select different host groups: Use the host filter. Change time range: Use the time picker above the charts, or drag and select a time range on a chart. Change the number of elements on charts: use the Chart shows dropdown. Change data used to order hosts: Use the table below the charts to order the chart elements by different metrics; for example, from highest to lowest CPU user % to lowest, or from lowest to highest Disk free. System tab functions Here are some of the things you can do from the System tab: If you want to... Do this... Filter and group hosts Use filter sets to show only hosts matching certain criteria, or use group by to aggregate the results. Understand host health Use the Health column of the table. To see more details about specific violations, select the health status icons. Find root causes of issues Use the Events heatmap at the top of the page to compare performance to important events happening in your infrastructure. For more, see Events heatmap. Set an alert condition for a metric Mouse over a chart, select and then Create alert. View host's alert threshold violation If present, select the host's Critical icon or Warning icon. APM and infrastructure data If you have APM data associated with your infrastructure data, there are several ways to access your APM data on the Hosts page: Use the hosts filter to filter on hosts running specific applications. In the host list below the charts, select the Application column to filter on specific applications. From the chart selector dropdown beside a chart's name, select one of the application-related charts. Important APM charts in infrastructure monitoring do not have View query or Create alert options like the other infrastructure charts do. For more about using APM and infrastructure monitoring together, see APM data in infrastructure. Network tab The Network page provides real-time visibility into the health and performance of individual hosts, web servers, or other groups of resources across your network. Default charts show bandwidth metrics by packet, bandwidth by bytes, and errors per second. Details about individual interfaces can help you: Examine saturation levels across your network or for selected filter sets. Compare load balances between specific resources. Identify unexpected differences in capacity patterns between similar hosts. Evaluate the top five network errors that New Relic automatically presents for the selected time period. This real-time network data can then help you determine whether to resolve errors by reconfiguring your network, rebalancing the loads, or taking other preventative maintenance actions before needing to make a purchase decision. From the Network tab you can view bandwidth and error data about your network interfaces. The Network page includes an Events heatmap, which provides a snapshot of the events occurring within the same time range as the displayed metrics.

To enable the sending of process data set enable_process_metrics to true. To fine-tune which processes you want to monitor, configure include_matching_metrics. Use the Processes tab to get information about processes running on your hosts, and to set alerts on process metrics. The Processes tab shows data such as CPU percentage, I/O bytes, and memory usage for individual processes or groupings of processes. The page also includes an events heatmap, which provides a snapshot of the events occurring within the same time range as the displayed metrics. Use this information to: Pinpoint processes that are causing performance issues. Create alerts for conditions such as CPU percentage and memory usage. On the Processes page, CPU percent is scoped to individual processes, rather than hosts. Because of this, the CPU percent metric does not take into account the resources of the entire system. Instead, it shows how much of a single CPU core each process is taking. Example Here's an example of how to pinpoint an issue and set an alert: You notice on the Hosts page that a cluster has a CPU percentage much higher than normal. You go to the Processes page and filter down to that cluster's processes. You notice that several instances of the same process have excessive CPU percentage. After fixing the issue, you decide to create an alert condition that triggers when the CPU percentage for that process type exceeds a certain threshold. For a technical explanation of the attributes used to populate the Processes page chart, see ProcessSample attributes. Tip You cannot start, stop, or restart processes from the UI. Instead, follow standard procedures to start, stop, check, or restart the infrastructure agent manually. Processes tab functions Here are some of the things you can do from the Processes tab: If you want to... Do this... Only show hosts matching certain criteria Use filter sets. Aggregate results or group by host attributes Use Group by to change how the processes are grouped in the chart and the list. The dropdown contains host-related attributes such as hostID and entityName. If you are monitoring AWS EC2 instances, EC2-related attributes such as awsRegion will be available. Select a time range Use either of these options: Select any of the time picker options at the top of the page. Click and drag on the chart to select a custom time range. After you select a time range, it carries over from one infrastructure page to another. View Docker metrics To view process usage by Docker containers, see Docker instrumentation. Change charts Select the dropdown beside the chart's name to switch what metric the chart displays. Choices include: Memory: Resident or virtual size CPU percentage Disk I/O: Read or write Search and filter the list Use either of these options: Type in the Search processes search bar. Select the list item or user name you want to filter for. The selected filters appear beside the filter icon above the chart, where you can select and remove them as needed. Set an alert condition for a metric Mouse over a chart. Select and then Create alert. (Not available on APM charts.) View host's alert threshold violation Select the host's Critical icon or Warning icon. Storage tab The Storage page allows you to monitor your resources' capacity and efficiency, including your devices' overall utilization, disk usage, or I/O operations. This can help you to: Examine unexpected patterns; for example, a cluster of mirrored machines that do not process I/O tasks uniformly. Monitor usage levels before disk space completely runs out. Set alert conditions to notify you about problems with one or more hosts; for example, long processing times for read or write operations, disk availability or utilization based on percentage or bytes, etc. Make informed decisions about where to redistribute hosts with higher or lower than normal processing requests. Use data to help plan for additions or changes to your infrastructure budget before an emergency arises. The Storage page includes an Events heatmap, which provides a snapshot of the events occurring within the same time range as the displayed metrics. For a technical explanation of the attributes used to populate the Storage page chart, see StorageSample attributes. Storage tab functions Here are some of the things you can do from the Storage tab: If you want to... Do this... Filter and group Use filter sets to show only hosts matching certain criteria, or use Group by to aggregate the results.

      "body": "Applications are automatically removed from New Relic after 93 days without sending data to our platform. You can also remove an application using the UI, once it has stopped sending data. Key metrics will continue to be available via the New Relic REST API, with the application name remaining reserved. For more information, see Inactive apps in New Relic One and our data retention guidelines. Before attempting to remove an app Before attempting to remove an app monitored by New Relic APM, browser monitoring, or mobile monitoring from the UI, keep in mind: You can downgrade your account to pay less or make it entirely free. The ability to remove an app from the UI may be dependent on permissions. If an agent is still sending data from an app, you cannot remove that app. Remove an application from New Relic Before you can remove an application monitored by New Relic APM, browser monitoring, or mobile monitoring, the app must first stop reporting data. Do this by disabling the agent (explained below) or by uninstalling the agent completely. APM applications Disable an APM agent using these instructions: C SDK: Do a quick recompile and deploy. For example, surround your instrumentation in #ifdef, and set the value of YOURNAMESPACE_NEWRELIC_ENABLED with your build system. Go: Set Enabled to false. Java: Set agent_enabled to false. .NET: Set Newrelic.AgentEnabled to false. Node.js: Set agent_enabled to false. PHP: Remove or disable both the newrelic.so and newrelic-daemon components. Set newrelic.enabled to false. Python: Set monitor_mode to false. Ruby: Set agent_enabled to false. Restart the application server and wait up to ten minutes. Verify the color-coded health status for the app has turned to gray and is no longer reporting data. To remove the APM application from the UI (and any associated apps in browser monitoring), you have a few options: Delete the app from the UI. Go to one.newrelic.com > APM > (select an app/service) > Settings > Application, and click the Delete application button. Use NerdGraph to delete an entity. If you've done the above and are still seeing that app in the UI, you can use NerdGraph to delete the relevant entities. For how to find entity IDs, see Entities. Browser If you've used the copy/paste method to install the browser agent, remove the JavaScript snippet from your application's pages. After 93 days, that app will be removed from the UI. If you want to remove it sooner than that, you have several options: Delete an associated APM app. If your browser app is linked to an APM application, deleting the APM application also removes the browser application. See the instructions for deleting an APM app. Delete it from the UI. Go to one.newrelic.com > Browser > (select an app) > Settings > Application settings, and click the Delete application button. Use NerdGraph to delete an entity. If you've done the above and are still seeing that app in the UI, you can use NerdGraph to delete the relevant entities. For how to find entity IDs, see Entities. Mobile Remove all references/dependencies to New Relic's mobile monitoring SDK/frameworks, then rebuild the application. For more information, see the iOS and Android install docs. After 93 days, the app will be removed from the UI. If you want to remove it sooner than that, you have several options: Remove it using the UI. Go to one.newrelic.com > Mobile > (select an app) > Settings > Application, and click Delete application. Use NerdGraph to delete an entity. If you've done the above and are still seeing that app in the UI, you can use NerdGraph to delete the relevant entities. For how to find entity IDs, see Entities. Troubleshooting If you have problems removing an app, here are some possible causes and suggested solutions: You lack permissions If you don't have relevant permissions, you won't be able to remove an application. You have not waited long enough All app data must stop reporting to New Relic before you can remove that entity from New Relic. In most cases, this takes between 10-15 minutes. In rare cases, it can take a few minutes longer. Not all agents are disabled If you have multiple agents reporting data under the same UI name, then you must make sure you disable or uninstall all of the agents associated with that entity. You have problems removing your PHP app If you have a PHP app and aren't able to remove it from the UI, possible causes include: You have not disabled both components of the PHP agent. You must stop or uninstall both newrelic.so and newrelic-daemon in order to be able to remove a PHP app. For more information, see New Relic daemon processes. You have set up per-directory monitoring of your PHP app, and unexpected PHP data is reporting as the default PHP application in the New Relic UI. To fix this, change the default app name in the PHP agent config. You don't know where the app's data is coming from If you don't know where an app's data is coming from, it may be because the app's name has been changed. When an app name is changed in the UI, it does not change the underlying app name being reported; it only changes how the app name appears in the UI. To see if there is a difference between the reported name and the displayed name: From one.newrelic.com, select APM, then select an application. Scroll down to Settings and select Application. Compare the name in the Application alias field to the name in the Your application still reports as message directly beneath it. To get host information about an app you are not familiar with: From one.newrelic.com, select APM, then select an application. From the summary view, review the Servers list. Once you have identified where app data is coming from, you can remove the app from New Relic. Browser data is still reporting To remove an app from New Relic, all data must have stopped reporting, including browser monitoring data. To verify that you have disabled or uninstalled the APM agent associated with the app: Ensure that browser monitoring is disabled. If your browser monitoring script is inserted by the APM agent, turn it off from inside the UI, in the agent's config file, or in both. If you copied and pasted the monitoring JavaScript snippet in certain pages, remove that JavaScript snippet manually. Ensure all caches have been cleared that the application uses, such as host caches, CDNs, or anything else that caches built pages. Optional: To see a count of how many page views report from each domain, use this NRQL query: SELECT count(*) FROM PageView WHERE appName = 'YOUR_BROWSER_APP_NAME' FACET domain Copy If these steps don't resolve the issue, it is likely due to an end-user's browser cache that hasn't yet cleared. Wait until those caches clear. If your app has internal users, you may be able to identify the users and clear those caches.",

Related procedures: To permanently disable APM, uninstall the agent. To configure an agent to monitor some things but not others, use custom instrumentation. Disable the APM agent Select your agent type for instructions: C SDK The C SDK cannot be turned on or off directly. However, you can write your code for the SDK so that a quick recompile and deploy can enable or disable your instrumentation. Follow standard procedures to disable or uninstall the C SDK. Go There are two main ways to disable the Go agent: Remove the import of the github.com/newrelic/go-agent package from your application, and remove or comment out any calls to the newrelic namespace. Then, recompile and restart your app. Use the enabled configuration setting. Then, recompile and restart your app. (This will not reduce overhead because the instrumentation is still running; it will only prevent the sending of data to the New Relic collector.) Tip After you disable the agent, it may take several minutes for data to stop showing up. Java There are three main ways to disable the Java agent: Set agent_enabled to false, then restart the JVM. Use the JVM command line flag: -Dnewrelic.config.agent_enabled=false Copy Then restart the JVM. Remove the newrelic.jar or newrelic.yml file, then restart the JVM. Tip After you disable the agent, it may take several minutes for data to stop showing up. .NET The method to disable the agent depends on if you are using Framework or Core: .NET Framework: Set agentEnabled to false in the global newrelic.config file, found in C:\\ProgramData\\New Relic\\.NET Agent\\. If the application is IIS-hosted, restart IIS. If it's self-hosted (non-IIS), restart the application. .NET Core: Set agentEnabled to false in the newrelic.config file found in the Core agent’s installation directory (for Windows alongside NewRelic.Profiler.dll and for Linux alongside NewRelic.Profiler.so). If you use the ASP.NET Core Module, reset IIS. Otherwise, restart your Core application. Tip After you disable the agent, it may take several minutes for data to stop showing up. Node.js There are two main ways to disable the Node.js agent: Set agent_enabled to false in your agent config file, then restart the app server. Set the NEW_RELIC_ENABLED environment variable to false. Tip After you disable the agent, it may take several minutes for data to stop showing up. PHP To disable the PHP agent, set the enabled config setting to false, then restart the web server or PHP. Tip After you disable the agent, it may take several minutes for data to stop showing up. Python There are three main ways to disable the Python agent, depending on your preference and setup: Standard install: Use the monitor_mode configuration setting. This can be done by editing the config file or by using an environment variable. Standard install with newrelic-admin script: Remove reference to that script in your application. Manual instrumentation: Remove the initialization script from your application. Tip After you disable the agent, it may take several minutes for data to stop showing up. Ruby There are several ways to disable the Ruby agent, depending on your preference and setup. These methods will remove most instrumentation but there will still be a small amount of activity and overhead: Use the agent_enabled configuration setting. This can be done in the configuration file or in the per-environment stanzas. Restart your app server afterward. Do the same via an environment variable, then restart the app server. The following methods will remove all instrumentation and overhead: Remove newrelic_rpm from the Gemfile and bundle install. Set the following in the Gemfile and bundle install: gem 'newrelic_rpm', :require => false Copy This option ensures the gem is installed if it's required somewhere in the app, but doesn't install it when bundling.

You can filter your hosts by attributes and compare their performance with inventory change events to help determine root causes. You can also set alert notifications to help prevent problems. To view your hosts information, go to one.newrelic.com > Infrastructure > Hosts, then click any of the following tabs: System: Overview of your hosts' performance Network: Bandwidth and error data about your network interfaces Processes: Data about CPU percentage, I/O bytes, and memory usage for individual or groups of processes Storage: Resources' capacity and efficiency, including your devices' overall utilization, disk usage, or I/O operations Docker containers: CPU percentage, I/O bytes, and memory usage for individual or group of containers System tab Here are the default graphs shown on the Hosts page. For additional chart options, select the dropdown for any chart. CPU %: On the System tab, CPU Percent is a derived metric that is part of the SystemSample event. The CPU percentage is not collected by New Relic, but derived from several other metrics. Specifically, the cpuPercent attribute is an aggregation of cpuUserPercent, cpuSystemPercent, cpuIoWaitPercent and cpuStealPercent. Load average five minute: represents an average of the number of tasks waiting to do work on a system over the last 5 minutes. Memory free %: compares the amount of free memory bytes to the amount of used memory bytes. For explanations of different chart metrics, see Default infrastructure attributes and events. Functions for adjusting chart data include: Select different host groups: Use the host filter. Change time range: Use the time picker above the charts, or drag and select a time range on a chart. Change the number of elements on charts: use the Chart shows dropdown. Change data used to order hosts: Use the table below the charts to order the chart elements by different metrics; for example, from highest to lowest CPU user % to lowest, or from lowest to highest Disk free. System tab functions Here are some of the things you can do from the System tab: If you want to... Do this... Filter and group hosts Use filter sets to show only hosts matching certain criteria, or use group by to aggregate the results. Understand host health Use the Health column of the table. To see more details about specific violations, select the health status icons. Find root causes of issues Use the Events heatmap at the top of the page to compare performance to important events happening in your infrastructure. For more, see Events heatmap. Set an alert condition for a metric Mouse over a chart, select and then Create alert. View host's alert threshold violation If present, select the host's Critical icon or Warning icon. APM and infrastructure data If you have APM data associated with your infrastructure data, there are several ways to access your APM data on the Hosts page: Use the hosts filter to filter on hosts running specific applications. In the host list below the charts, select the Application column to filter on specific applications. From the chart selector dropdown beside a chart's name, select one of the application-related charts. Important APM charts in infrastructure monitoring do not have View query or Create alert options like the other infrastructure charts do. For more about using APM and infrastructure monitoring together, see APM data in infrastructure. Network tab The Network page provides real-time visibility into the health and performance of individual hosts, web servers, or other groups of resources across your network. Default charts show bandwidth metrics by packet, bandwidth by bytes, and errors per second. Details about individual interfaces can help you: Examine saturation levels across your network or for selected filter sets. Compare load balances between specific resources. Identify unexpected differences in capacity patterns between similar hosts. Evaluate the top five network errors that New Relic automatically presents for the selected time period. This real-time network data can then help you determine whether to resolve errors by reconfiguring your network, rebalancing the loads, or taking other preventative maintenance actions before needing to make a purchase decision. From the Network tab you can view bandwidth and error data about your network interfaces. The Network page includes an Events heatmap, which provides a snapshot of the events occurring within the same time range as the displayed metrics. For a technical explanation of the attributes used to populate the Network page chart, see NetworkSample attributes. Network tab functions Here are some of the things you can do from the Network tab: If you want to... Do this... Filter and group Use filter sets to show only hosts matching certain criteria, or use Group by to aggregate the results. Select a time range Use the time picker to change the range of time selected. You can also click and drag on the chart to select a custom time range. When you select a time range, it carries over when you go from one infrastructure page to another. Change metrics displayed in chart Use the sorting dropdown to switch what metric the chart is displaying for the chosen process groupings, including: Received Bytes Received Dropped Received Errors Received Packets Transmitted Bytes Transmitted Dropped Transmitted Errors Transmitted Packets Search and filter the list Type in the Search interfaces search bar to filter the list to only those items containing the text you've typed. You can also filter the list by simply selecting the list item or user name you want to filter for. The chosen filters are displayed beside the filter icon above the chart.

Set an alert condition for a metric Mouse over a chart, select and then Create alert. (Not available on APM charts.) View host's alert threshold violation Select the host's Critical icon or Warning icon. Processes tab Important By default, the infrastructure agent doesn't send data about the operating system's processes unless you use guided install. To enable the sending of process data set enable_process_metrics to true. To fine-tune which processes you want to monitor, configure include_matching_metrics. Use the Processes tab to get information about processes running on your hosts, and to set alerts on process metrics. The Processes tab shows data such as CPU percentage, I/O bytes, and memory usage for individual processes or groupings of processes. The page also includes an events heatmap, which provides a snapshot of the events occurring within the same time range as the displayed metrics. Use this information to: Pinpoint processes that are causing performance issues. Create alerts for conditions such as CPU percentage and memory usage. On the Processes page, CPU percent is scoped to individual processes, rather than hosts. Because of this, the CPU percent metric does not take into account the resources of the entire system. Instead, it shows how much of a single CPU core each process is taking. Example Here's an example of how to pinpoint an issue and set an alert: You notice on the Hosts page that a cluster has a CPU percentage much higher than normal. You go to the Processes page and filter down to that cluster's processes. You notice that several instances of the same process have excessive CPU percentage. After fixing the issue, you decide to create an alert condition that triggers when the CPU percentage for that process type exceeds a certain threshold. For a technical explanation of the attributes used to populate the Processes page chart, see ProcessSample attributes. Tip You cannot start, stop, or restart processes from the UI. Instead, follow standard procedures to start, stop, check, or restart the infrastructure agent manually. Processes tab functions Here are some of the things you can do from the Processes tab: If you want to... Do this... Only show hosts matching certain criteria Use filter sets. Aggregate results or group by host attributes Use Group by to change how the processes are grouped in the chart and the list. The dropdown contains host-related attributes such as hostID and entityName. If you are monitoring AWS EC2 instances, EC2-related attributes such as awsRegion will be available. Select a time range Use either of these options: Select any of the time picker options at the top of the page. Click and drag on the chart to select a custom time range. After you select a time range, it carries over from one infrastructure page to another. View Docker metrics To view process usage by Docker containers, see Docker instrumentation.

Choices include: Memory: Resident or virtual size CPU percentage Disk I/O: Read or write Search and filter the list Use either of these options: Type in the Search processes search bar. Select the list item or user name you want to filter for. The selected filters appear beside the filter icon above the chart, where you can select and remove them as needed. Set an alert condition for a metric Mouse over a chart. Select and then Create alert. (Not available on APM charts.) View host's alert threshold violation Select the host's Critical icon or Warning icon. Storage tab The Storage page allows you to monitor your resources' capacity and efficiency, including your devices' overall utilization, disk usage, or I/O operations. This can help you to: Examine unexpected patterns; for example, a cluster of mirrored machines that do not process I/O tasks uniformly. Monitor usage levels before disk space completely runs out. Set alert conditions to notify you about problems with one or more hosts; for example, long processing times for read or write operations, disk availability or utilization based on percentage or bytes, etc. Make informed decisions about where to redistribute hosts with higher or lower than normal processing requests. Use data to help plan for additions or changes to your infrastructure budget before an emergency arises. The Storage page includes an Events heatmap, which provides a snapshot of the events occurring within the same time range as the displayed metrics. For a technical explanation of the attributes used to populate the Storage page chart, see StorageSample attributes. Storage tab functions Here are some of the things you can do from the Storage tab: If you want to... Do this... Filter and group Use filter sets to show only hosts matching certain criteria, or use Group by to aggregate the results.

      "body": "Deploying an app can be a risky event—when your app breaks, a bad deployment is often the cause. New Relic allows you to track deployments so you can correlate deploy to your app's performance. Tracking deployments creates deployment markers that appear in APM charts. See how deployment markers work in this short video (4:30 minutes): Options for tracking deployments You can use the New Relic REST API v2 to record new deployments, retrieve a list of past deployments, and delete past deployments on your APM application. In addition, some APM agents have agent-specific methods to record deployments automatically. You can use your Slack integration with New Relic, or a simple webhook, to notify your team in real time of deployments for applications monitored by APM. Slack provides a webhook URL that allows you to post generic JSON that will appear formatted in a chosen Slack channel. There are a few places where you can view deployments in the New Relic UI after they have been recorded. You can view deployments in the UI: In the activity feed of the APM Summary, New Relic One Service summary, and entity summary pages. On APM performance charts as a chart marker. On the Deployments page for summary performance. Tip Deployment markers are not available for browser applications, but see browser releases for a way to tag errors with release versions. Record deployments with the REST API You can use the New Relic REST API v2 to record deployments, get a list of past deployments, and delete deployments. The examples in this document use curl as a command line tool. However, you can use any method to make your REST requests. You can also create, view, and delete deployments with the API Explorer. JSON uses double quotes \" for element names and content. Using single quotes ' will cause errors. Record a deployment with POST To record a new deployment, send a POST request that includes your API key to the deployments endpoint. Attach the payload in JSON format (see Character limits and JSON parameters). All payload parameters are optional except revision. For example: curl -X POST \"https://api.newrelic.com/v2/applications/$APP_ID/deployments.json\" \\ -H \"Api-Key:$API_KEY\" \\ -i \\ -H \"Content-Type: application/json\" \\ -d \\ '{ \"deployment\": { \"revision\": \"REVISION\", \"changelog\": \"Added: /v2/deployments.rb, Removed: None\", \"description\": \"Added a deployments resource to the v2 API\", \"user\": \"datanerd@example.com\", \"timestamp\": \"2019-10-08T00:15:36Z\" } }' Copy Record a deployment with PowerShell To record a deployment with PowerShell, send a POST request that includes your API key to the deployments endpoint. Attach the payload in JSON format (see Character limits and JSON parameters). All payload parameters are optional except revision. This example uses PowerShell version 3 or higher: Invoke-WebRequest -Uri https://api.newrelic.com/v2/applications/YOUR_APP_ID/deployments.json -Method POST -Headers @{'Api-Key'='$API_KEY'} -ContentType 'application/json' -Body '{ \"deployment\": { \"revision\": \"REVISION\", \"changelog\": \"Added: /v2/deployments.rb, Removed: None\", \"description\": \"Added a deployments resource to the v2 API\", \"user\": \"datanerd@example.com\", \"timestamp\": \"2019-10-08T00:15:36Z\" } }' Copy This example uses PowerShell version 2 (requires .NET framework 3.5 or higher): $encoding = [System.Text.Encoding]::GetEncoding(\"ASCII\") $data ='{ \"deployment\": { \"revision\": \"REVISION\", \"changelog\": \"Added: /v2/deployments.rb, Removed: None\", \"description\": \"Added a deployments resource to the v2 API\", \"user\": \"datanerd@example.com\", \"timestamp\": \"2019-10-08T00:15:36Z\" } }' $postData = $encoding.GetBytes($data) $request = [System.Net.WebRequest]::Create('https://api.newrelic.com/v2/applications/$APP_ID/deployments.json') $request.Method = 'POST' $request.Headers.add('Api-Key','$API_KEY') $request.ContentType='application/json' $stream = $request.GetRequestStream() $stream.Write($postData,0,$postData.Length) $request.GetResponse() Copy View a list of deployments with GET To retrieve a list of all past deployments for your app, send a GET request that includes your API key to the deployments endpoint. GET requests do not use a JSON payload. For example: curl -X GET \"https://api.newrelic.com/v2/applications/$APP_ID/deployments.json\" \\ -H \"Api-Key:$API_KEY\" \\ -i Copy Sample output from GET This example requests a list of deployments for app ID 9999999: curl -X GET \"https://api.newrelic.com/v2/applications/9999999/deployments.json\" \\ -H \"Api-Key:ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXabcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwx\" \\ -i Copy The API returns this list of deployments: HTTP/1.1 200 OK ETag: \"ABCDEFGHIJKabcdefghijk0123456789\" Cache-Control: max-age=0, private, must-revalidate Content-Type: application/json { \"deployments\": [ { \"id\": 1234567, \"revision\": \"1234123412341234123412341234123412341234\", \"changelog\": \"Fixed the bugs for real this time\", \"description\": \"Example description two\", \"user\": \"Data Nerd\", \"timestamp\": \"2016-02-24T10:09:27-08:00\", \"links\": { \"application\": 9999999 } }, { \"id\": 2345678, \"revision\": \"7890789078907890789078907890789078907890\", \"changelog\": \"Think I fixed all the bugs\", \"description\": null, \"user\": \"Dren Atad\", \"timestamp\": \"2014-10-22T12:23:47-07:00\", \"links\": { \"application\": 9999999 } } ], \"links\": { \"deployment.agent\": \"/v2/applications/{application_id}\" } } Copy Delete a deployment with DELETE To delete a deployment, send a DELETE request that includes your API key to the deployments endpoint. DELETE requests do not use a JSON payload, but you must specify the ID for the deployment you want to delete. To retrieve the ID for a deployment, use the GET request. For example: curl -X DELETE \"https://api.newrelic.com/v2/applications/$APP_ID/deployments/$DEPLOYMENT_ID.json\" \\ -H \"Api-Key:$API_KEY\" \\ -i Copy Character limits and JSON parameters The JSON payload can include the following parameters. Important UTF-8 4 byte characters, such as Emojis and some non-Latin language glyphs, cannot be used in the deployment text. Parameter Data type Description revision String, 127 character maximum Required. A unique ID for this deployment, visible in the Summary page and on the Deployments page. Can be any string, but is usually a version number or a Git checksum. changelog String, 65535 character maximum Optional. A summary of what changed in this deployment, visible in the Deployments page when you select (selected deployment) > Change log. description String, 65535 character maximum Optional. A high-level description of this deployment, visible in the Summary page and on the Deployments page when you select an individual deployment. user String, 31 character maximum Optional. A username to associate with the deployment, visible in the Summary page and on the Deployments page. timestamp ISO 8601 Optional. When the deployment occurred, down to the second. If not specified, the deployment will be recorded at the time when the API call was received. Timestamp requirements: Must be in UTC time. Must be after the most recent deployment timestamp. Cannot be in the future. Must be in ISO8601 format; for example, \"2019-10-08T00:15:36Z\". Record deployments using the New Relic agent Some agents have additional methods to record deployments: All agents: Use the New Relic REST API v2. C: No SDK-specific methods. Use the REST API. Go: No agent-specific methods. Use the REST API. Java: Call the Java agent jar. .NET: Use PowerShell and the REST API. Node.js: No agent-specific methods. Use the REST API. PHP: Use a PHP script. Python: Use the record-deploy subcommand of the newrelic-admin script. Ruby: Use a Capistrano recipe. Notify your team of deployments After a deployment is recorded using the REST API, you can optionally notify a webhook endpoint of the deployment. The destination of the webhook can be your Slack instance. To use webhooks to set up a deployment notification for a Slack channel: Log in to your Slack account as an admin, then go to App directory > Manage > Apps. Search for your New Relic app, then select Add configuration. From Post to channel, select an existing Slack channel or add a new channel, then Add configuration. From the list of options, copy the webhook URL. Go to one.newrelic.com > (account dropdown) > Account settings > Integrations > Deploy notifications > Webhook. Paste the Slack webhook URL, then save. Optional: Send a test message. Tip You can also use webhooks, Slack channels, and other options for alert notifications with New Relic Alerts. End of life notification: Hipchat, Campfire As of September 9, 2019, integrations with Hipchat and Campfire for APM deployment notifications will no longer be available. Recommendation: If you are still using Hipchat or Campfire, use webhooks with Slack channels instead. For more information, see the New Relic Explorers Hub post.",

Related procedures: To permanently disable APM, uninstall the agent. To configure an agent to monitor some things but not others, use custom instrumentation. Disable the APM agent Select your agent type for instructions: C SDK The C SDK cannot be turned on or off directly. However, you can write your code for the SDK so that a quick recompile and deploy can enable or disable your instrumentation. Follow standard procedures to disable or uninstall the C SDK. Go There are two main ways to disable the Go agent: Remove the import of the github.com/newrelic/go-agent package from your application, and remove or comment out any calls to the newrelic namespace. Then, recompile and restart your app. Use the enabled configuration setting. Then, recompile and restart your app. (This will not reduce overhead because the instrumentation is still running; it will only prevent the sending of data to the New Relic collector.) Tip After you disable the agent, it may take several minutes for data to stop showing up. Java There are three main ways to disable the Java agent: Set agent_enabled to false, then restart the JVM. Use the JVM command line flag: -Dnewrelic.config.agent_enabled=false Copy Then restart the JVM. Remove the newrelic.jar or newrelic.yml file, then restart the JVM. Tip After you disable the agent, it may take several minutes for data to stop showing up. .NET The method to disable the agent depends on if you are using Framework or Core: .NET Framework: Set agentEnabled to false in the global newrelic.config file, found in C:\\ProgramData\\New Relic\\.NET Agent\\. If the application is IIS-hosted, restart IIS. If it's self-hosted (non-IIS), restart the application. .NET Core: Set agentEnabled to false in the newrelic.config file found in the Core agent’s installation directory (for Windows alongside NewRelic.Profiler.dll and for Linux alongside NewRelic.Profiler.so). If you use the ASP.NET Core Module, reset IIS. Otherwise, restart your Core application. Tip After you disable the agent, it may take several minutes for data to stop showing up. Node.js There are two main ways to disable the Node.js agent: Set agent_enabled to false in your agent config file, then restart the app server. Set the NEW_RELIC_ENABLED environment variable to false. Tip After you disable the agent, it may take several minutes for data to stop showing up. PHP To disable the PHP agent, set the enabled config setting to false, then restart the web server or PHP. Tip After you disable the agent, it may take several minutes for data to stop showing up. Python There are three main ways to disable the Python agent, depending on your preference and setup: Standard install: Use the monitor_mode configuration setting. This can be done by editing the config file or by using an environment variable. Standard install with newrelic-admin script: Remove reference to that script in your application. Manual instrumentation: Remove the initialization script from your application. Tip After you disable the agent, it may take several minutes for data to stop showing up. Ruby There are several ways to disable the Ruby agent, depending on your preference and setup. These methods will remove most instrumentation but there will still be a small amount of activity and overhead: Use the agent_enabled configuration setting. This can be done in the configuration file or in the per-environment stanzas. Restart your app server afterward. Do the same via an environment variable, then restart the app server. The following methods will remove all instrumentation and overhead: Remove newrelic_rpm from the Gemfile and bundle install. Set the following in the Gemfile and bundle install: gem 'newrelic_rpm', :require => false Copy This option ensures the gem is installed if it's required somewhere in the app, but doesn't install it when bundling.

You can filter your hosts by attributes and compare their performance with inventory change events to help determine root causes. You can also set alert notifications to help prevent problems. To view your hosts information, go to one.newrelic.com > Infrastructure > Hosts, then click any of the following tabs: System: Overview of your hosts' performance Network: Bandwidth and error data about your network interfaces Processes: Data about CPU percentage, I/O bytes, and memory usage for individual or groups of processes Storage: Resources' capacity and efficiency, including your devices' overall utilization, disk usage, or I/O operations Docker containers: CPU percentage, I/O bytes, and memory usage for individual or group of containers System tab Here are the default graphs shown on the Hosts page. For additional chart options, select the dropdown for any chart. CPU %: On the System tab, CPU Percent is a derived metric that is part of the SystemSample event. The CPU percentage is not collected by New Relic, but derived from several other metrics. Specifically, the cpuPercent attribute is an aggregation of cpuUserPercent, cpuSystemPercent, cpuIoWaitPercent and cpuStealPercent. Load average five minute: represents an average of the number of tasks waiting to do work on a system over the last 5 minutes. Memory free %: compares the amount of free memory bytes to the amount of used memory bytes. For explanations of different chart metrics, see Default infrastructure attributes and events. Functions for adjusting chart data include: Select different host groups: Use the host filter. Change time range: Use the time picker above the charts, or drag and select a time range on a chart. Change the number of elements on charts: use the Chart shows dropdown. Change data used to order hosts: Use the table below the charts to order the chart elements by different metrics; for example, from highest to lowest CPU user % to lowest, or from lowest to highest Disk free. System tab functions Here are some of the things you can do from the System tab: If you want to... Do this... Filter and group hosts Use filter sets to show only hosts matching certain criteria, or use group by to aggregate the results. Understand host health Use the Health column of the table. To see more details about specific violations, select the health status icons. Find root causes of issues Use the Events heatmap at the top of the page to compare performance to important events happening in your infrastructure. For more, see Events heatmap. Set an alert condition for a metric Mouse over a chart, select and then Create alert. View host's alert threshold violation If present, select the host's Critical icon or Warning icon. APM and infrastructure data If you have APM data associated with your infrastructure data, there are several ways to access your APM data on the Hosts page: Use the hosts filter to filter on hosts running specific applications. In the host list below the charts, select the Application column to filter on specific applications. From the chart selector dropdown beside a chart's name, select one of the application-related charts. Important APM charts in infrastructure monitoring do not have View query or Create alert options like the other infrastructure charts do. For more about using APM and infrastructure monitoring together, see APM data in infrastructure. Network tab The Network page provides real-time visibility into the health and performance of individual hosts, web servers, or other groups of resources across your network. Default charts show bandwidth metrics by packet, bandwidth by bytes, and errors per second. Details about individual interfaces can help you: Examine saturation levels across your network or for selected filter sets. Compare load balances between specific resources. Identify unexpected differences in capacity patterns between similar hosts. Evaluate the top five network errors that New Relic automatically presents for the selected time period. This real-time network data can then help you determine whether to resolve errors by reconfiguring your network, rebalancing the loads, or taking other preventative maintenance actions before needing to make a purchase decision. From the Network tab you can view bandwidth and error data about your network interfaces. The Network page includes an Events heatmap, which provides a snapshot of the events occurring within the same time range as the displayed metrics.

Change metrics displayed in chart Use the sorting dropdown to switch what metric the chart is displaying for the chosen process groupings, including: Received Bytes Received Dropped Received Errors Received Packets Transmitted Bytes Transmitted Dropped Transmitted Errors Transmitted Packets Search and filter the list Type in the Search interfaces search bar to filter the list to only those items containing the text you've typed. You can also filter the list by simply selecting the list item or user name you want to filter for. The chosen filters are displayed beside the filter icon above the chart. Add items to chart The chart, by default, displays the top five results. Use the Chart shows dropdown to display more results. To remove an item from a chart, select its name below the chart. Set an alert condition for a metric Mouse over a chart, select and then Create alert. (Not available on APM charts.) View host's alert threshold violation Select the host's Critical icon or Warning icon. Processes tab Important By default, the infrastructure agent doesn't send data about the operating system's processes unless you use guided install. To enable the sending of process data set enable_process_metrics to true. To fine-tune which processes you want to monitor, configure include_matching_metrics. Use the Processes tab to get information about processes running on your hosts, and to set alerts on process metrics. The Processes tab shows data such as CPU percentage, I/O bytes, and memory usage for individual processes or groupings of processes. The page also includes an events heatmap, which provides a snapshot of the events occurring within the same time range as the displayed metrics. Use this information to: Pinpoint processes that are causing performance issues. Create alerts for conditions such as CPU percentage and memory usage. On the Processes page, CPU percent is scoped to individual processes, rather than hosts. Because of this, the CPU percent metric does not take into account the resources of the entire system. Instead, it shows how much of a single CPU core each process is taking. Example Here's an example of how to pinpoint an issue and set an alert: You notice on the Hosts page that a cluster has a CPU percentage much higher than normal. You go to the Processes page and filter down to that cluster's processes. You notice that several instances of the same process have excessive CPU percentage. After fixing the issue, you decide to create an alert condition that triggers when the CPU percentage for that process type exceeds a certain threshold. For a technical explanation of the attributes used to populate the Processes page chart, see ProcessSample attributes. Tip You cannot start, stop, or restart processes from the UI. Instead, follow standard procedures to start, stop, check, or restart the infrastructure agent manually. Processes tab functions Here are some of the things you can do from the Processes tab: If you want to... Do this... Only show hosts matching certain criteria Use filter sets. Aggregate results or group by host attributes Use Group by to change how the processes are grouped in the chart and the list. The dropdown contains host-related attributes such as hostID and entityName. If you are monitoring AWS EC2 instances, EC2-related attributes such as awsRegion will be available. Select a time range Use either of these options: Select any of the time picker options at the top of the page. Click and drag on the chart to select a custom time range. After you select a time range, it carries over from one infrastructure page to another. View Docker metrics To view process usage by Docker containers, see Docker instrumentation. Change charts Select the dropdown beside the chart's name to switch what metric the chart displays. Choices include: Memory: Resident or virtual size CPU percentage Disk I/O: Read or write Search and filter the list Use either of these options: Type in the Search processes search bar. Select the list item or user name you want to filter for. The selected filters appear beside the filter icon above the chart, where you can select and remove them as needed. Set an alert condition for a metric Mouse over a chart. Select and then Create alert. (Not available on APM charts.) View host's alert threshold violation Select the host's Critical icon or Warning icon. Storage tab The Storage page allows you to monitor your resources' capacity and efficiency, including your devices' overall utilization, disk usage, or I/O operations. This can help you to: Examine unexpected patterns; for example, a cluster of mirrored machines that do not process I/O tasks uniformly. Monitor usage levels before disk space completely runs out. Set alert conditions to notify you about problems with one or more hosts; for example, long processing times for read or write operations, disk availability or utilization based on percentage or bytes, etc. Make informed decisions about where to redistribute hosts with higher or lower than normal processing requests. Use data to help plan for additions or changes to your infrastructure budget before an emergency arises. The Storage page includes an Events heatmap, which provides a snapshot of the events occurring within the same time range as the displayed metrics. For a technical explanation of the attributes used to populate the Storage page chart, see StorageSample attributes. Storage tab functions Here are some of the things you can do from the Storage tab: If you want to... Do this... Filter and group Use filter sets to show only hosts matching certain criteria, or use Group by to aggregate the results.

      "body": "Application performance monitoring (APM) is exactly what it sounds like: monitoring of your web or non-web application's performance. APM supports apps for several programming languages, including Go, Java, .NET, Node.js, PHP, Python, and Ruby, as well as a C SDK. View the status of all your services at a glance with APM. Tip This doc gives you detailed information about why APM matters to your business. But if you want to skip ahead, just sign up for a New Relic account. (It's free, forever!) Then, after you install the agent, you can start working with your data. Ready to get started? Start benefiting from APM in five simple steps (and just a few minutes!). Sign up for a New Relic account (it's free, forever!). Install and customize the language agent for your app. Generate some traffic for your app. Wait a few minutes for New Relic to start receiving your data. Log in to your account, and start exploring New Relic! Use the Explorer in New Relic One to access and observe the full stack of your software, including your apps, see performance data and alerting status at a glance, and check relationships. We provide you with a simple, yet powerful visual tool to monitor all your entities, that is, anything we can identify that reports data. In the New Relic ecosystem, entities include basic components like applications, hosts, containers, or database services, but it can also refer to custom groupings of such elements. You can also create your own entities. If data does not appear after waiting a few minutes, follow the troubleshooting tips for your APM agent. Identify problems before your users do Our APM agents report and store the state of your application so you can quickly identify potential problems before they affect your end users. With APM, your DevOps teams don't need to guess whether a performance blocker comes from the app itself, CPU availability, database loads, or something entirely unexpected. Use our APM solutions to gather both current and historical information about memory usage, CPU utilization, database query performance, web browser rendering performance, app availability, error analysis, external services, and other useful metrics. Monitor all aspects of your business Take advantage of these APM features, and more: Features Description App performance at a glance When you sign in to APM and select an app for your account, use the Summary page to quickly examine relationships across different aspects of your environment; for example: Web transactions response time: Where is the most time being spent? In the request queue, during different stages of page rendering and execution, from external services, or something else? Transaction traces: Which transactions are the slowest, and why? Error rate and throughput: What relationship is there between a spike in errors or slower throughput for a particular time period? Was there a deployment or outage at that time? Hosts: What kind of impact does this have on CPU usage, memory, etc.? Apdex: How are these events affecting customers' satisfaction with the site? Web and non-web transactions Start by comparing the top twenty web transactions or non-web transactions in terms of most time consuming, slowest average response time, highest throughput, or worst Apdex. From there, drill down into deeper trace levels for individual transactions, which in turn break down into smaller segments and components, from HTTPS requests on down to SQL queries. Want to explore even deeper? Set up distributed tracing to see how requests move across a distributed system. Select the transactions that are most important to your business (key transactions). APM and Infrastructure When your APM and Infrastructure accounts are linked, you will have access to APM data charts on these Infrastructure UI pages: Hosts, Network, Storage, and Processes. Distributed tracing Distributed tracing gives you visibility across distributed systems, showing you the path of a request as it travels between services. This feature is especially valuable for large, distributed systems that rely on many small services and microservices. Logs Bring your logs and application's data together to make troubleshooting easier and faster. With logs in context, you can see log messages related to your errors and traces directly in your app's UI. You can also see logs in context of your infrastructure data, such as Kubernetes clusters. No need to switch to another UI page in New Relic One. Service maps APM's service maps show your app's connections and dependencies, including databases and external services. Health indicators and performance metrics show you the current operational status for every part of your architecture. You can create and customize service maps to visualize and monitor your complex architectures. Query your data You can query and visualize your data: Sample and search APM transaction and error data to gain full understanding of the data being collected. Browse your data visually with the data explorer. Create custom SQL-like queries of your data using the New Relic Query Language (NRQL), or using our PromQL-style queries. Use dashboards to build advanced data visualizations, contextualize data, and understand what's going on in your system, real-time. These are just a few of APM's features.

Extend agent instrumentation Other helpful tools include: Tools Description Browser monitoring Integrate the Python agent with browser monitoring to gain visibility into end-user browser activity. Simple scripts and background tasks Monitor job-based or task queuing systems, like Celery, or other standalone non-web functions. Business data analysis with data exploration. Use the Python agent with our data explorer to organize, query, and visualize your data to answer key questions about application performance and customer experience. Use default transaction attributes, or add your own. Query your data using the New Relic Query Language (NRQL). Send your own event data. Create and share customizable, interactive dashboards. Install the Python agent Before you install the Python agent, make sure your system meets the system requirements. You must also create a New Relic account. We support a number of web frameworks and libraries right out of the box, including Django, WSGI, and Gunicorn. If you use one of the supported web frameworks, installation is easy. If you use an unsupported framework, the process will involve some additions to your app code and/or web server files. For a quick and simple install process that will work for the majority of setups, follow these simple steps: Download and install the Python package. Create config file. Integrate the Python agent with your application. Read the Quick Start guide Add Python data Monitor non-web scripts, background tasks, and functions The Python agent also lets you monitor non-web scripts, worker processes, tasks, and functions. The installation process for these non-web transactions is similar to the one used for a web app, with one major difference: instead of going through the standard integration process described in the install instructions, you would manually \"wrap\" any function you want to monitor. For more information, see Non-web tasks and processes. For instructions on monitoring Celery tasks, see Celery background tasks. What's next after installation? Once you get the agent up and running, some suggested next steps are: Explore your data in and get comfortable with the user interface. Read our docs on our other observability solutions and the APM page. Change your application's name, or other configuration options. Learn about setting up custom instrumentation for application activity not monitored by default. Consider the Python Telemetry SDK. Troubleshooting After you complete the install process, your data should appear in the APM UI within five minutes. If it does not, use these troubleshooting resources: If no data appears, follow these troubleshooting steps. If you experience issues when installing or running the Python agent on a new host, test that the package is installed correctly and that it can contact New Relic's data collector service. For other problems, see the full list of troubleshooting documentation. Check the source code The Python agent is open source software. That means you can browse its source code and send improvements, or create your own fork and build it. For more information, see the README.",

      "body": "New Relic requires HTTPS for all traffic to APM and the New Relic REST API. The Ruby agent connects to New Relic collector servers over SSL by default, and uses a system/host installed set of SSL certificate to validate the identity of the collector servers when connecting. In most cases, this default set of certificates is sufficient. In certain configurations, you may need to use a custom CA bundle. For example, you may use an HTTP proxy to intercept and decrypt SSL traffic from the agent, which then establishes a separate SSL connection to New Relic. Custom CA bundles are available in versions 3.9.4 or higher of the Ruby agent. Use a custom CA bundle To configure the agent to use a custom CA bundle when validating the SSL certificate presented by a proxy, set the ca_bundle_path configuration setting in your newrelic.yml file or via the NEW_RELIC_CA_BUNDLE_PATH environment variable: common: &default_settings ca_bundle_path: certificates/mycert.pem # ... other settings ... Copy Specify a path to a .pem file containing each certificate you want the agent to use when validating the identity of the proxy or server. You can concatenate multiple certificates into a single .pem file. Relative path: If you specify a relative path, the agent will assign a path relative to the working directory of your app server process at runtime. Absolute path: If your working directory is / rather than the root of your application, be sure to specify an absolute path. Installing SSL Certificates If you're deploying a Ruby application and agent to a container or server that does not have CA certificates installed, you need to ensure they're now installed for 7.0 or highter releases of the agent to make successful HTTPS connections to New Relic servers. These CA certificates may be installed in various ways, depending on your host.

In the request queue, during different stages of page rendering and execution, from external services, or something else? Transaction traces: Which transactions are the slowest, and why? Error rate and throughput: What relationship is there between a spike in errors or slower throughput for a particular time period? Was there a deployment or outage at that time? Hosts: What kind of impact does this have on CPU usage, memory, etc.? Apdex: How are these events affecting customers' satisfaction with the site? Web and non-web transactions Start by comparing the top twenty web transactions or non-web transactions in terms of most time consuming, slowest average response time, highest throughput, or worst Apdex. From there, drill down into deeper trace levels for individual transactions, which in turn break down into smaller segments and components, from HTTPS requests on down to SQL queries. Want to explore even deeper? Set up distributed tracing to see how requests move across a distributed system. Select the transactions that are most important to your business (key transactions). APM and Infrastructure When your APM and Infrastructure accounts are linked, you will have access to APM data charts on these Infrastructure UI pages: Hosts, Network, Storage, and Processes. Distributed tracing Distributed tracing gives you visibility across distributed systems, showing you the path of a request as it travels between services. This feature is especially valuable for large, distributed systems that rely on many small services and microservices. Logs Bring your logs and application's data together to make troubleshooting easier and faster. With logs in context, you can see log messages related to your errors and traces directly in your app's UI. You can also see logs in context of your infrastructure data, such as Kubernetes clusters. No need to switch to another UI page in New Relic One. Service maps APM's service maps show your app's connections and dependencies, including databases and external services. Health indicators and performance metrics show you the current operational status for every part of your architecture. You can create and customize service maps to visualize and monitor your complex architectures. Query your data You can query and visualize your data: Sample and search APM transaction and error data to gain full understanding of the data being collected. Browse your data visually with the data explorer. Create custom SQL-like queries of your data using the New Relic Query Language (NRQL), or using our PromQL-style queries. Use dashboards to build advanced data visualizations, contextualize data, and understand what's going on in your system, real-time. These are just a few of APM's features.

Use the Python agent with our data explorer to organize, query, and visualize your data to answer key questions about application performance and customer experience. Use default transaction attributes, or add your own. Query your data using the New Relic Query Language (NRQL). Send your own event data. Create and share customizable, interactive dashboards. Install the Python agent Before you install the Python agent, make sure your system meets the system requirements. You must also create a New Relic account. We support a number of web frameworks and libraries right out of the box, including Django, WSGI, and Gunicorn. If you use one of the supported web frameworks, installation is easy. If you use an unsupported framework, the process will involve some additions to your app code and/or web server files. For a quick and simple install process that will work for the majority of setups, follow these simple steps: Download and install the Python package. Create config file. Integrate the Python agent with your application. Read the Quick Start guide Add Python data Monitor non-web scripts, background tasks, and functions The Python agent also lets you monitor non-web scripts, worker processes, tasks, and functions. The installation process for these non-web transactions is similar to the one used for a web app, with one major difference: instead of going through the standard integration process described in the install instructions, you would manually \"wrap\" any function you want to monitor. For more information, see Non-web tasks and processes. For instructions on monitoring Celery tasks, see Celery background tasks. What's next after installation? Once you get the agent up and running, some suggested next steps are: Explore your data in and get comfortable with the user interface. Read our docs on our other observability solutions and the APM page. Change your application's name, or other configuration options. Learn about setting up custom instrumentation for application activity not monitored by default. Consider the Python Telemetry SDK. Troubleshooting After you complete the install process, your data should appear in the APM UI within five minutes. If it does not, use these troubleshooting resources: If no data appears, follow these troubleshooting steps. If you experience issues when installing or running the Python agent on a new host, test that the package is installed correctly and that it can contact New Relic's data collector service. For other problems, see the full list of troubleshooting documentation. Check the source code The Python agent is open source software. That means you can browse its source code and send improvements, or create your own fork and build it. For more information, see the README.",

The Ruby agent connects to New Relic collector servers over SSL by default, and uses a system/host installed set of SSL certificate to validate the identity of the collector servers when connecting. In most cases, this default set of certificates is sufficient. In certain configurations, you may need to use a custom CA bundle. For example, you may use an HTTP proxy to intercept and decrypt SSL traffic from the agent, which then establishes a separate SSL connection to New Relic. Custom CA bundles are available in versions 3.9.4 or higher of the Ruby agent. Use a custom CA bundle To configure the agent to use a custom CA bundle when validating the SSL certificate presented by a proxy, set the ca_bundle_path configuration setting in your newrelic.yml file or via the NEW_RELIC_CA_BUNDLE_PATH environment variable: common: &default_settings ca_bundle_path: certificates/mycert.pem # ... other settings ... Copy Specify a path to a .pem file containing each certificate you want the agent to use when validating the identity of the proxy or server. You can concatenate multiple certificates into a single .pem file. Relative path: If you specify a relative path, the agent will assign a path relative to the working directory of your app server process at runtime. Absolute path: If your working directory is / rather than the root of your application, be sure to specify an absolute path. Installing SSL Certificates If you're deploying a Ruby application and agent to a container or server that does not have CA certificates installed, you need to ensure they're now installed for 7.0 or highter releases of the agent to make successful HTTPS connections to New Relic servers.

      "body": "Application performance monitoring (APM) is exactly what it sounds like: monitoring of your web or non-web application's performance. APM supports apps for several programming languages, including Go, Java, .NET, Node.js, PHP, Python, and Ruby, as well as a C SDK. View the status of all your services at a glance with APM. Tip This doc gives you detailed information about why APM matters to your business. But if you want to skip ahead, just sign up for a New Relic account. (It's free, forever!) Then, after you install the agent, you can start working with your data. Ready to get started? Start benefiting from APM in five simple steps (and just a few minutes!). Sign up for a New Relic account (it's free, forever!). Install and customize the language agent for your app. Generate some traffic for your app. Wait a few minutes for New Relic to start receiving your data. Log in to your account, and start exploring New Relic! Use the Explorer in New Relic One to access and observe the full stack of your software, including your apps, see performance data and alerting status at a glance, and check relationships. We provide you with a simple, yet powerful visual tool to monitor all your entities, that is, anything we can identify that reports data. In the New Relic ecosystem, entities include basic components like applications, hosts, containers, or database services, but it can also refer to custom groupings of such elements. You can also create your own entities. If data does not appear after waiting a few minutes, follow the troubleshooting tips for your APM agent. Identify problems before your users do Our APM agents report and store the state of your application so you can quickly identify potential problems before they affect your end users. With APM, your DevOps teams don't need to guess whether a performance blocker comes from the app itself, CPU availability, database loads, or something entirely unexpected. Use our APM solutions to gather both current and historical information about memory usage, CPU utilization, database query performance, web browser rendering performance, app availability, error analysis, external services, and other useful metrics. Monitor all aspects of your business Take advantage of these APM features, and more: Features Description App performance at a glance When you sign in to APM and select an app for your account, use the Summary page to quickly examine relationships across different aspects of your environment; for example: Web transactions response time: Where is the most time being spent? In the request queue, during different stages of page rendering and execution, from external services, or something else? Transaction traces: Which transactions are the slowest, and why? Error rate and throughput: What relationship is there between a spike in errors or slower throughput for a particular time period? Was there a deployment or outage at that time? Hosts: What kind of impact does this have on CPU usage, memory, etc.? Apdex: How are these events affecting customers' satisfaction with the site? Web and non-web transactions Start by comparing the top twenty web transactions or non-web transactions in terms of most time consuming, slowest average response time, highest throughput, or worst Apdex. From there, drill down into deeper trace levels for individual transactions, which in turn break down into smaller segments and components, from HTTPS requests on down to SQL queries. Want to explore even deeper? Set up distributed tracing to see how requests move across a distributed system. Select the transactions that are most important to your business (key transactions).

      "body": "In a DevOps world, a deep understanding of customer expectations and your progress in meeting those expectations is vital to providing stability, maintaining goodwill with your users, and increasing business value. With New Relic you can measure the success of your DevOps initiatives and learn how to identify, resolve, and decrease any gaps in your DevOps performance. In this tutorial, you’ll gather key service delivery stakeholders to assess your team's progress against service level objectives (SLOs) and service level agreements (SLAs), while facilitating further optimizations. Prerequisites This tutorial assumes you’ve completed the Establish objectives and baseline tutorial. 1. Assemble a cross-functional team to review service delivery The first (and most important step) is assembling the right team. Identify the proper stakeholders and representatives to play active parts in the operations review process. This team should be comprised of individuals who develop applications, work with service delivery, maintain your ecosystem, and resolve problems for customers. While operations review teams often focus on technical members, the best teams have broad representation across the company, including representatives from Business Operations, Marketing, and Support. These cross-functional teams help ensure that the service delivery process is strongly integrated with customer expectations. If you can specifically identify how technical improvements meet customer expectations and positively impact the business’s bottom line, then your operations team is functioning at optimal levels. Tip Ideally, the cross-functional operations review team should also be the team that defines your SLOs. If this is not possible, try to ensure that some members of the operations review team are also on the team responsible for SLOs. 2. Review service records and note key metrics Create a regular meeting to track your service records. New Relic recommends reviewing your previous service records, and pinpointing specific metrics to analyze at every review. For example, start with application state, alert conditions, and runtime anomalies. Look at the same metrics on two separate occasions to identify and assess patterns, inconsistencies, and anomalies. Monitor these metrics using the service delivery Insights dashboards you created in the Establish objectives and baselines tutorial. The widgets on these dashboards provide a high-level overview of the relationships between different performance indicators and baselines: insights.newrelic.com > (select a dashboard): Use dashboards to visualize metrics related to service delivery. When conducting a thorough performance review, make several dashboards that have corresponding widgets. Use these dashboards to hone-in on two specific time periods that you want to compare. This comparative analysis could cover everything from Infrastructure or browser performance, to Synthetics testing or business impact. To get started with performance indicators in Insights, read the following example queries. These queries provide information that you can consider incorporating for the operations review. Daily uptime SELECT percentage(count(result), where result = 'SUCCESS') from SyntheticCheck since 1 Day ago Copy Create dashboards that are dedicated to the functionality that drives your software development process, such as testing. For example, collect related metrics on uptime, types of monitors, geo-locations, and other data points that are required for appropriately measuring SLAs. The following dashboard provides such an example: insights.newrelic.com > (select a dashboard): Track your relevant SLAs together in one dashboard. Device performance breakdown SELECT count(*) as '# Pages',average(duration) as 'AVG',percentile(duration,50,75) as '%',average(duration - backendDuration) as 'Front',average(backendDuration) as 'Back',average(connectionSetupDuration) as 'Connection',average(domProcessingDuration) as 'DOM Processing',average(pageRenderingDuration) as 'Page Rendering' FROM PageView FACET deviceType LIMIT 3 SINCE 1 day ago Copy Top URL performance SELECT count(*) as '# Pages',average(duration) as 'AVG',percentile(duration,50,75) as '%',average(duration - backendDuration) as 'Front',average(backendDuration) as 'Back',average(connectionSetupDuration) as 'Connection',average(domProcessingDuration) as 'DOM Processing',average(pageRenderingDuration) as 'Page Rendering' FROM PageView facet pageUrl SINCE 1 day ago limit 30 Copy Memory usage SELECT average(memoryUsedBytes) /1000000 AS 'Avg MB Used', average(memoryFreeBytes)/1000000 AS 'Avg MB Free', average(memoryFreeBytes/memoryTotalBytes)*100 as 'Memory used %' FROM SystemSample since 30 minutes ago Copy Server CPU SELECT average(cpuPercent) FROM SystemSample since 3 hours ago facet hostname limit 400 Copy Combine the results into a single dashboard to help drive decisions during your operations review. Dashboards that give a brief overview of performance across your entire application stack are invaluable for cross-functional team reviews. Tip Beyond Insights, the APM reports allow you to see how you’re performing on a daily, weekly, and monthly basis with built in SLA reports and other detailed reports. The out-of-the-box details from these reports give your operations team a launch pad for conversations about progress against objectives and overall performance. 3. Summarize events related to application alerts, downtime, and errors Now that you’ve gathered data about your service delivery, the next step is to dive deeper into specific incidents that warrant further investigation or surface a need for broader team action. For example, notable downtime and errors are key areas to investigate as a team. After completing the Setup proactive alerting tutorial, you can explore notifications of violations as they occur. Once these violations are brought to your attention, acknowledge the specific incident and have an ongoing record of both opened and closed incidents. Use the incident reports as a focal point for discussion of gaps. alerts.newrelic.com > Incidents: Identify performance issues and SLA gaps with New Relic Alerts incident reports. Ultimately, it’s important to solicit feedback from the cross-functional team on the causes of the incidents to determine how you can improve service delivery processes to prevent reoccurrences. One approach might be to focus on one or two notable incidents, use the New Relic UI to walk through the data points leading up to those incidents, and assess the actions that occurred. Summarize the incident and the cross-functional feedback on causes and potential solutions as succinctly as possible. Over time, you’ll notice patterns that will require deeper action.",

      "body": "BETA FEATURE This feature is currently in beta. With New Relic you can define and consume service level indicators and service level objectives for your applications. What are SLIs and SLOs? Service Levels are used to measure the performance of a service from the end user (or client application) point of view. For instance, a Service Level can represent whether a video loaded quickly enough, or whether a directions service returned at least one possible route between two points. Service level indicators (SLIs) are accurate quantitative measures of the user experience as described by a service level. They represent a proportion of successful outputs, and therefore they’re expressed as a percentage (%). For example, an SLI can measure the proportion of requests that were faster than some threshold, or the proportion of records coming into a pipeline that resulted in the correct value coming out. And while users understand that a video might take a few additional seconds to load, or that an application might return an error from time to time, this shouldn’t happen often if you don’t want to lose their trust. Therefore, once you’ve defined SLIs for the performance aspects that are most relevant for the end users of your services, you need to set SLOs to track that the service is meeting their expectations. Service level objectives (SLOs) are defined as a target value that an SLI must meet over a period of time. For example, videos must start playing in less than 2 seconds 99% of the time over a week period. Please refer to the Service Level management use case implementation guide to learn more about identifying service boundaries and deploying the instrumentation that your service levels will be based on. Service Levels and APM SLA reports New Relic has provided automatic SLA Reports for APM Services for a long time. The Apdex-based reports, which you can get on your email inbox on Mondays, are automatically generated for services that produce web transactions, and are useful to see trends over time. On top of the SLAs, our new SLM level capability is better aligned with modern service level best practices, such as those promoted by the Google SRE Handbook, and provides new, improved functionality: SLIs can be defined on any NRDB event that is reported to New Relic, not just APM transactions. Therefore you can also base SLIs on your own custom events. You can decide which service boundaries and which metrics are relevant for your service levels, and you can set your own objectives. You can view SLO results across your accounts, and within your workloads. What's next? Ready to get started? If you don't already have one, sign up for a free New Relic account. You can find Service Levels in several places in New Relic One: At the top nav bar, under the More menu (which you can customize). At the previews of those entities that have an SLI defined. In APM services, at the reports section. Within a workload, at the Service Levels tab. Carry on and read our docs on how to create and consume SLIs and SLOs. You can also check out how to manage SLMs with our API.",

SLA tips Comments Requirements When using the cURL command examples, be sure to replace the placeholder text with your account ID, an API key, and the application ID. Time ranges You are not limited to standard day, week, or month time ranges. For example, you can extract metric data for a \"holiday weekend\" from 12/23 to 12/26 or \"the 20 minutes after our site had problems\" or whatever other period interests you. UTC XML time format You must specify the time in UTC XML format, so be sure to adjust for your time zone compared to UTC. For example, New Relic starts at 16:00:00 on the day before the selected data, since New Relic headquarters are in UTC-8. Summary reports When requesting metrics to use with summary reports, include the query string parameter summarize=true (v2) or summary=1 (v1) as shown in the examples. Scaled statistics Your report has some statistics that are scaled in the SLA reports in New Relic's user interface. New Relic changes the scale of page views in your report to show small numbers. Depending on your traffic, typically it might be displayed in thousands, millions, or billions. Recommendation: To avoid a string of zeroes, divide this number appropriately for your own purposes. End user statistics End user statistics will reflect only the calls in which the agent gathered browser data. For example, end user stats may not appear in situations such as: Browser types Clients (they might have disabled the JavaScript agent, or blocked traffic to New Relic sites for JavaScript code's location Transactions not in one of those categories, in case the page load did not complete for any reason This is why there are fewer (sometimes many fewer) page views in the End User (browser) data section than in the App server data section. Examples The following sections contain code examples to acquire the data for values described above for the Daily (24hr) SLA statistics in the default GMT/UTC time zone. Adjust the from= and to= for your time range as desired. There are syntactical differences between New Relic's REST API v2 and v1. The examples show how to use each.

      "body": "In a DevOps world, a deep understanding of customer expectations and your progress in meeting those expectations is vital to providing stability, maintaining goodwill with your users, and increasing business value. With New Relic you can measure the success of your DevOps initiatives and learn how to identify, resolve, and decrease any gaps in your DevOps performance. In this tutorial, you’ll gather key service delivery stakeholders to assess your team's progress against service level objectives (SLOs) and service level agreements (SLAs), while facilitating further optimizations. Prerequisites This tutorial assumes you’ve completed the Establish objectives and baseline tutorial. 1. Assemble a cross-functional team to review service delivery The first (and most important step) is assembling the right team. Identify the proper stakeholders and representatives to play active parts in the operations review process. This team should be comprised of individuals who develop applications, work with service delivery, maintain your ecosystem, and resolve problems for customers. While operations review teams often focus on technical members, the best teams have broad representation across the company, including representatives from Business Operations, Marketing, and Support. These cross-functional teams help ensure that the service delivery process is strongly integrated with customer expectations. If you can specifically identify how technical improvements meet customer expectations and positively impact the business’s bottom line, then your operations team is functioning at optimal levels. Tip Ideally, the cross-functional operations review team should also be the team that defines your SLOs. If this is not possible, try to ensure that some members of the operations review team are also on the team responsible for SLOs. 2. Review service records and note key metrics Create a regular meeting to track your service records. New Relic recommends reviewing your previous service records, and pinpointing specific metrics to analyze at every review. For example, start with application state, alert conditions, and runtime anomalies. Look at the same metrics on two separate occasions to identify and assess patterns, inconsistencies, and anomalies. Monitor these metrics using the service delivery Insights dashboards you created in the Establish objectives and baselines tutorial. The widgets on these dashboards provide a high-level overview of the relationships between different performance indicators and baselines: insights.newrelic.com > (select a dashboard): Use dashboards to visualize metrics related to service delivery. When conducting a thorough performance review, make several dashboards that have corresponding widgets. Use these dashboards to hone-in on two specific time periods that you want to compare. This comparative analysis could cover everything from Infrastructure or browser performance, to Synthetics testing or business impact. To get started with performance indicators in Insights, read the following example queries. These queries provide information that you can consider incorporating for the operations review. Daily uptime SELECT percentage(count(result), where result = 'SUCCESS') from SyntheticCheck since 1 Day ago Copy Create dashboards that are dedicated to the functionality that drives your software development process, such as testing. For example, collect related metrics on uptime, types of monitors, geo-locations, and other data points that are required for appropriately measuring SLAs. The following dashboard provides such an example: insights.newrelic.com > (select a dashboard): Track your relevant SLAs together in one dashboard. Device performance breakdown SELECT count(*) as '# Pages',average(duration) as 'AVG',percentile(duration,50,75) as '%',average(duration - backendDuration) as 'Front',average(backendDuration) as 'Back',average(connectionSetupDuration) as 'Connection',average(domProcessingDuration) as 'DOM Processing',average(pageRenderingDuration) as 'Page Rendering' FROM PageView FACET deviceType LIMIT 3 SINCE 1 day ago Copy Top URL performance SELECT count(*) as '# Pages',average(duration) as 'AVG',percentile(duration,50,75) as '%',average(duration - backendDuration) as 'Front',average(backendDuration) as 'Back',average(connectionSetupDuration) as 'Connection',average(domProcessingDuration) as 'DOM Processing',average(pageRenderingDuration) as 'Page Rendering' FROM PageView facet pageUrl SINCE 1 day ago limit 30 Copy Memory usage SELECT average(memoryUsedBytes) /1000000 AS 'Avg MB Used', average(memoryFreeBytes)/1000000 AS 'Avg MB Free', average(memoryFreeBytes/memoryTotalBytes)*100 as 'Memory used %' FROM SystemSample since 30 minutes ago Copy Server CPU SELECT average(cpuPercent) FROM SystemSample since 3 hours ago facet hostname limit 400 Copy Combine the results into a single dashboard to help drive decisions during your operations review. Dashboards that give a brief overview of performance across your entire application stack are invaluable for cross-functional team reviews. Tip Beyond Insights, the APM reports allow you to see how you’re performing on a daily, weekly, and monthly basis with built in SLA reports and other detailed reports. The out-of-the-box details from these reports give your operations team a launch pad for conversations about progress against objectives and overall performance. 3. Summarize events related to application alerts, downtime, and errors Now that you’ve gathered data about your service delivery, the next step is to dive deeper into specific incidents that warrant further investigation or surface a need for broader team action. For example, notable downtime and errors are key areas to investigate as a team. After completing the Setup proactive alerting tutorial, you can explore notifications of violations as they occur. Once these violations are brought to your attention, acknowledge the specific incident and have an ongoing record of both opened and closed incidents. Use the incident reports as a focal point for discussion of gaps. alerts.newrelic.com > Incidents: Identify performance issues and SLA gaps with New Relic Alerts incident reports. Ultimately, it’s important to solicit feedback from the cross-functional team on the causes of the incidents to determine how you can improve service delivery processes to prevent reoccurrences. One approach might be to focus on one or two notable incidents, use the New Relic UI to walk through the data points leading up to those incidents, and assess the actions that occurred. Summarize the incident and the cross-functional feedback on causes and potential solutions as succinctly as possible. Over time, you’ll notice patterns that will require deeper action.",

      "body": "BETA FEATURE This feature is currently in beta. With New Relic you can define and consume service level indicators and service level objectives for your applications. What are SLIs and SLOs? Service Levels are used to measure the performance of a service from the end user (or client application) point of view. For instance, a Service Level can represent whether a video loaded quickly enough, or whether a directions service returned at least one possible route between two points. Service level indicators (SLIs) are accurate quantitative measures of the user experience as described by a service level. They represent a proportion of successful outputs, and therefore they’re expressed as a percentage (%). For example, an SLI can measure the proportion of requests that were faster than some threshold, or the proportion of records coming into a pipeline that resulted in the correct value coming out. And while users understand that a video might take a few additional seconds to load, or that an application might return an error from time to time, this shouldn’t happen often if you don’t want to lose their trust. Therefore, once you’ve defined SLIs for the performance aspects that are most relevant for the end users of your services, you need to set SLOs to track that the service is meeting their expectations. Service level objectives (SLOs) are defined as a target value that an SLI must meet over a period of time. For example, videos must start playing in less than 2 seconds 99% of the time over a week period. Please refer to the Service Level management use case implementation guide to learn more about identifying service boundaries and deploying the instrumentation that your service levels will be based on. Service Levels and APM SLA reports New Relic has provided automatic SLA Reports for APM Services for a long time. The Apdex-based reports, which you can get on your email inbox on Mondays, are automatically generated for services that produce web transactions, and are useful to see trends over time. On top of the SLAs, our new SLM level capability is better aligned with modern service level best practices, such as those promoted by the Google SRE Handbook, and provides new, improved functionality: SLIs can be defined on any NRDB event that is reported to New Relic, not just APM transactions. Therefore you can also base SLIs on your own custom events. You can decide which service boundaries and which metrics are relevant for your service levels, and you can set your own objectives. You can view SLO results across your accounts, and within your workloads. What's next? Ready to get started? If you don't already have one, sign up for a free New Relic account. You can find Service Levels in several places in New Relic One: At the top nav bar, under the More menu (which you can customize). At the previews of those entities that have an SLI defined. In APM services, at the reports section. Within a workload, at the Service Levels tab. Carry on and read our docs on how to create and consume SLIs and SLOs. You can also check out how to manage SLMs with our API.",

      "body": "Here are troubleshooting tips when using cross application traces. Note that this feature is not the same as distributed tracing, which is preferred over cross application tracing. Agent versions and protocols Make sure you meet these requirements for your agent's version, protocols, interfaces, or message queue libraries. If you are using a protocol that is not listed here, you will not see a connection between your applications. Agent version Notes C SDK Use distributed tracing. Go 1.11 or higher HTTP, HTTPS Java 3.9.0 or higher HTTP, HTTPs, JMS 1.1, RabbitMQ The Java agent also supports several message queue libraries, including those that use the JMS 1.1 interface. .NET 4.2 or higher HTTP, and supported .NET messaging systems Node.js 2.0.0 or higher HTTP, HTTPS, RabbitMQ PHP 4.19.0 or higher HTTP, HTTPS, and supported PHP message queuing systems Python 2.38.0.31 or higher HTTP, HTTPS, and supported Python message queuing systems Ruby 4.3.0 or higher HTTP, HTTPS, RabbitMQ Config file requirements In general, New Relic's cross application tracing feature is enabled by default. Requirements to change your configuration file vary, depending on your New Relic agent: C SDK (not supported) Go (not supported) Java .NET Node.js (no specific config file settings needed for Node.js) PHP Python Ruby High throughput apps Cross application traces rely on transaction events to associate related transactions. If you have a high throughput application, your agent may reach the maximum number of events that it can record in a minute and will fall back to sampling events. If a transaction’s events are sampled, you may see an incomplete cross application trace, including sometimes only the transactions that you are focused on. If your application has high throughput, some cross application traces will appear incomplete, sometimes with no links. Try viewing a different transaction trace. To reduce or eliminate sampling, you can also adjust the number of transaction events stored in your agent configuration. High throughput apps Troubleshooting tips Java From the transaction_events stanza, adjust the setting for max_samples_stored. Ruby Adjust the setting for analytics_events.max_samples_stored. Proxies If you expect to see a cross application trace link but it consistently does not appear, there may be a proxy or broker between your application’s communication. Cross application tracing relies on HTTP headers and JMS properties being passed from one application to other. HTTP proxies and message brokers sometimes strip those headers. Multi-threaded processing (Java) If one or more of your Java applications uses an async or \"reactive\" programming model, a transaction's activity may span across multiple threads. New Relic supports the Play framework and Servlet Async but not all async frameworks. For unsupported frameworks, activity on other threads is not reported as part of the transaction. Calls to other applications will not be traced. Multiple accounts Currently cross application traces do not cross New Relic accounts. If you have multiple New Relic accounts (including child accounts), you will only see traces for applications within one account. Our distributed tracing feature does cross account boundaries.",

      "body": "The word transaction can have several different meanings in the software industry. This document explains how the term is used by New Relic and how transactions are reported. What is a transaction? At New Relic, a transaction is defined as one logical unit of work in a software application. Specifically, it refers to the function calls and method calls that make up that unit of work. For APM, it will often refer to a web transaction, which represents activity that happens from when the application receives a web request to when the response is sent. When you install APM in a supported system, it begins automatically reporting web requests and other important functions and methods. To supplement the default level of monitoring, you can set up custom instrumentation to report additional transactions. Some frameworks do not have a natural concept of a transaction. In other words, there are no predefined pathways that can easily be recognized or monitored as transactions. To define transactions in such frameworks, you can use custom instrumentation. Types of transactions Cumulative transaction data appears in APM on the Transactions page. The two main categories of transactions are web and non-web: Web: Transactions are initiated with an HTTP request. For most organizations, these represent customer-centric interactions and thus are the most important transactions to monitor. Non-web: Non-web transactions are not initiated with a web request. They can include non-web worker processes, background processes, scripts, message queue activity, and other tasks. Transaction sub-types Our agents have these transaction sub-types: C SDK Sub-type Description Custom The execution of the named custom transaction. Usually recorded via manual instrumentation APIs. Function The invocation of the named function. Go Doesn't apply. Java Sub-type Description Custom The execution of the named custom transaction. Usually recorded via manual instrumentation APIs. framework The invocation of a framework that is recognized by the agent. .NET Sub-type Description Action The invocation of the named framework action. Used when the agent is able to identify a framework-specific action name. ASP The invocation of an ASP.NET request. Custom The execution of the named custom transaction. Usually recorded via manual instrumentation APIs. MonoRail The invocation of a MonoRail request. MVC The invocation of a MVC request. OpenRasta The invocation of an OpenRasta request. StatusCode The HTTP status code returned for the transaction. Often used when a more specific transaction sub-type is unavailable. WCF The invocation of a WCF request. WebAPI The invocation of a WebAPI request. WebService The invocation of a WebService request. Node.JS Sub-type Description Custom The execution of the named custom transaction. Usually recorded via manual instrumentation APIs. Message Message broker or queue communication. PHP Sub-type Description Action The invocation of the named framework action. Used when the agent is able to identify a framework-specific action name. Custom The execution of the named custom transaction. Usually recorded via manual instrumentation APIs. Function The invocation of the named function. PHP The invocation of a background PHP job. StatusCode The HTTP status code returned for the transaction. Often used when a more specific transaction sub-type is unavailable. unknown The invocation of an unknown web transaction or background job. URI The invocation of the named URI. Usually used when a framework or language level transaction name cannot be determined. Python Sub-type Description ASGIWeb WebTransaction from an ASGI application. Message Message broker or queue communication. WSGIWeb WebTransaction from a WSGI application. Ruby Sub-type Description Custom The execution of the named custom transaction. Usually recorded via manual instrumentation APIs. Transaction segments The individual functions and calls that make up a transaction are called segments. For example external service calls and database calls are segments, and both have their own UI pages in APM. The APM Transactions page displays aggregate transaction segment data. To add segments to a transaction, use custom instrumentation. To see the segments of a specific transaction, use transaction traces. Transaction naming For supported frameworks, transaction names can come from various sources, such as the name given to the transaction by the framework, function names detected during the transaction, or a web request's URL. For transactions that produce many names with a similar format, we consolidate those into general transaction categories. For example, a transaction might be displayed as /user/*/control_panel, where the * represents different user names. To rename transactions or adjust how names are consolidated, use custom instrumentation. Monitoring transactions Here are some other ways you can use APM to monitor transactions: If you want to monitor... Use this... Transactions important to your business Create key transactions, which emphasizes them in the UI and lets you set a custom level of monitoring for them. Async activity Follow the procedures to set up asynchronous activity for your specific APM language agent. Activity across applications Linking transactions across applications gives you more detail about business-relevant application activity. For more information, see the documentation about distributed tracing and cross application traces. Tip To get a high-level overview of all your applications and services, use the New Relic Explorer. Query transactions Transactions are available for querying with an in-depth set of default attributes attached. Using these attributes, you can run queries and create custom charts that APM does not provide by default. For information on how to query your data using our UI or NRQL, see Query New Relic data.",

      "body": "In APM, transaction traces record in-depth details about your application's transactions and database calls. You can edit the default settings for transaction traces. Configure transaction trace settings via agent You can customize your transaction trace settings via New Relic agent configuration files and other \"local\" configuration methods such as environment variables. For more information about transaction trace configuration options, see the specific New Relic language agent's documentation: C SDK Go Java .NET Node PHP Python Ruby Configure transaction traces using server-side configuration The ability to configure transaction traces using server-side configuration depends on the New Relic agent. If server-side configuration is not supported, the transaction trace settings will be visible in the UI but not editable. If server-side configuration settings are available for your New Relic agent, you can see them at the following: one.newrelic.com > APM > (select an app) > Settings > Application > Server-side agent configuration. Transaction trace settings available using server-side configuration will differ depending on the New Relic agent you use. The UI includes descriptions of each. Settings in the UI may include: Transaction tracing and threshold Record SQL, including recording level and input fields Log SQL and stack trace threshold SQL query plans and threshold Error collection, including HTTP code and error class Slow query tracing Thread profiler Cross application tracing Configure traces for specific (key) transactions If you want to monitor or alert on a transaction differently than other transactions, make it a key transaction. This is useful, for example, when you want to set a transaction-specific Apdex that is different from your general Apdex T threshold. Changing a key transaction's Apdex changes the likelihood that it creates a transaction trace. For example: If you want to make it more likely a key transaction would generate transaction traces, lower its Apdex T value. If you want to make a key transaction less likely to be traced, raise its Apdex T value. Important If you have the transaction trace threshold set to a number of seconds, and not to the default Apdex setting, the number-of-seconds threshold will act as the threshold for all transactions, even for key transactions that have custom Apdex settings. View logs for your APM and infrastructure data You can also bring your logs and application's data together to make troubleshooting easier and faster. With logs in context, you can see log messages related to your errors and traces directly in your app's UI. You can also see logs in context of your infrastructure data, such as Kubernetes clusters. No need to switch to another UI page in New Relic One. Create custom transactions You can create custom transactions for app activity that isn't being automatically captured as a transaction by the New Relic agent. For more information, see Custom instrumentation. Collect HTTP request attributes, parameters For data security reasons, transaction traces do not collect potentially sensitive HTTP request attributes, sometimes called parameters. Traces do collect some basic HTTP request attributes, which New Relic calls agent attributes. To edit attribute collection settings, see the specific New Relic agent: C SDK Go Java .NET Node.js (does not allow HTTP attribute configuration) PHP Python Ruby For more information, see Collect custom attributes. Delete a transaction trace When you delete a transaction trace, it is deleted permanently. Delete a single transaction trace To delete a transaction trace record permanently: Go to one.newrelic.com > APM > (select an app) > Monitor > Transactions. Under Transaction traces click on the trace you want to delete. On the details page, select Delete this trace. Delete all transaction traces To delete all traces for the selected app permanently: Go to one.newrelic.com > APM > (select an app) > Monitor > Transactions. Click Delete all traces. It may take fifteen minutes or more for all transaction trace records to disappear from the UI. To delete all traces for your account, contact us at support.newrelic.com. Tip If you are doing general record cleanup, you may also want to delete databases and slow query traces or error traces. This will remove potentially sensitive data while retaining your other application data (such as Apdex, deployment information, etc.).",

Important Instead of using cross application tracing, we recommend our distributed tracing features. Distributed tracing is an improvement on the cross application tracing feature and is recommended for large, distributed systems. APM's cross application traces link transactions between APM apps in your service-oriented architecture (SOA). This is useful, for example, to identify performance problems between your own application (the \"calling\" app) and any internal or external services (the \"called\" app), such as traffic to internal services. This helps you to: Spot bottlenecks in your cross application call flows. Understand from end to end how specific transactions are used by other applications and services. Diagnose problems faster and enhance collaboration across teams. Security considerations Cross application tracing relies on three HTTP headers in order to exchange information between the calling and called applications. The first two (X-NewRelic-ID and X-NewRelic-Transaction) appear as HTTP request headers in outgoing requests sent by an instrumented application. The remaining header (X-NewRelic-App-Data) is inserted into the HTTP response if the called application belongs to the same New Relic account as the calling application. New Relic obfuscates all of these headers using an obfuscation scheme identical to what we use for browser monitoring, but with a different key. HTTP header Description X-NewRelic-ID (in request header) Contains the account ID and application ID of the application making the call X-NewRelic-Transaction (in request header) Contains information about an individual transaction created by the call (a GUID unique to the calling transaction, along with information about upstream calls that spawned the transaction) X-NewRelic-App-Data (in the response if applicable) Contains information about the called application, including: Account ID Application ID Name of the called transaction Timing information for the called transaction GUID of the called transaction",

Transaction naming For supported frameworks, transaction names can come from various sources, such as the name given to the transaction by the framework, function names detected during the transaction, or a web request's URL. For transactions that produce many names with a similar format, we consolidate those into general transaction categories. For example, a transaction might be displayed as /user/*/control_panel, where the * represents different user names.

Configure transaction trace settings via agent You can customize your transaction trace settings via New Relic agent configuration files and other \"local\" configuration methods such as environment variables. For more information about transaction trace configuration options, see the specific New Relic language agent's documentation: C SDK Go Java .NET Node PHP Python Ruby Configure transaction traces using server-side configuration The ability to configure transaction traces using server-side configuration depends on the New Relic agent. If server-side configuration is not supported, the transaction trace settings will be visible in the UI but not editable. If server-side configuration settings are available for your New Relic agent, you can see them at the following: one.newrelic.com > APM > (select an app) > Settings > Application > Server-side agent configuration. Transaction trace settings available using server-side configuration will differ depending on the New Relic agent you use. The UI includes descriptions of each. Settings in the UI may include: Transaction tracing and threshold Record SQL, including recording level and input fields Log SQL and stack trace threshold SQL query plans and threshold Error collection, including HTTP code and error class Slow query tracing Thread profiler Cross application tracing Configure traces for specific (key) transactions If you want to monitor or alert on a transaction differently than other transactions, make it a key transaction. This is useful, for example, when you want to set a transaction-specific Apdex that is different from your general Apdex T threshold. Changing a key transaction's Apdex changes the likelihood that it creates a transaction trace. For example: If you want to make it more likely a key transaction would generate transaction traces, lower its Apdex T value. If you want to make a key transaction less likely to be traced, raise its Apdex T value. Important If you have the transaction trace threshold set to a number of seconds, and not to the default Apdex setting, the number-of-seconds threshold will act as the threshold for all transactions, even for key transactions that have custom Apdex settings. View logs for your APM and infrastructure data You can also bring your logs and application's data together to make troubleshooting easier and faster. With logs in context, you can see log messages related to your errors and traces directly in your app's UI. You can also see logs in context of your infrastructure data, such as Kubernetes clusters. No need to switch to another UI page in New Relic One. Create custom transactions You can create custom transactions for app activity that isn't being automatically captured as a transaction by the New Relic agent. For more information, see Custom instrumentation. Collect HTTP request attributes, parameters For data security reasons, transaction traces do not collect potentially sensitive HTTP request attributes, sometimes called parameters. Traces do collect some basic HTTP request attributes, which New Relic calls agent attributes. To edit attribute collection settings, see the specific New Relic agent: C SDK Go Java .NET Node.js (does not allow HTTP attribute configuration) PHP Python Ruby For more information, see Collect custom attributes. Delete a transaction trace When you delete a transaction trace, it is deleted permanently. Delete a single transaction trace To delete a transaction trace record permanently: Go to one.newrelic.com > APM > (select an app) > Monitor > Transactions. Under Transaction traces click on the trace you want to delete. On the details page, select Delete this trace. Delete all transaction traces To delete all traces for the selected app permanently: Go to one.newrelic.com > APM > (select an app) > Monitor > Transactions. Click Delete all traces. It may take fifteen minutes or more for all transaction trace records to disappear from the UI. To delete all traces for your account, contact us at support.newrelic.com. Tip If you are doing general record cleanup, you may also want to delete databases and slow query traces or error traces. This will remove potentially sensitive data while retaining your other application data (such as Apdex, deployment information, etc.).",

      "body": "The word transaction can have several different meanings in the software industry. This document explains how the term is used by New Relic and how transactions are reported. What is a transaction? At New Relic, a transaction is defined as one logical unit of work in a software application. Specifically, it refers to the function calls and method calls that make up that unit of work. For APM, it will often refer to a web transaction, which represents activity that happens from when the application receives a web request to when the response is sent. When you install APM in a supported system, it begins automatically reporting web requests and other important functions and methods. To supplement the default level of monitoring, you can set up custom instrumentation to report additional transactions. Some frameworks do not have a natural concept of a transaction. In other words, there are no predefined pathways that can easily be recognized or monitored as transactions. To define transactions in such frameworks, you can use custom instrumentation. Types of transactions Cumulative transaction data appears in APM on the Transactions page. The two main categories of transactions are web and non-web: Web: Transactions are initiated with an HTTP request. For most organizations, these represent customer-centric interactions and thus are the most important transactions to monitor. Non-web: Non-web transactions are not initiated with a web request. They can include non-web worker processes, background processes, scripts, message queue activity, and other tasks. Transaction sub-types Our agents have these transaction sub-types: C SDK Sub-type Description Custom The execution of the named custom transaction. Usually recorded via manual instrumentation APIs. Function The invocation of the named function. Go Doesn't apply. Java Sub-type Description Custom The execution of the named custom transaction. Usually recorded via manual instrumentation APIs. framework The invocation of a framework that is recognized by the agent. .NET Sub-type Description Action The invocation of the named framework action. Used when the agent is able to identify a framework-specific action name. ASP The invocation of an ASP.NET request. Custom The execution of the named custom transaction. Usually recorded via manual instrumentation APIs. MonoRail The invocation of a MonoRail request. MVC The invocation of a MVC request. OpenRasta The invocation of an OpenRasta request. StatusCode The HTTP status code returned for the transaction. Often used when a more specific transaction sub-type is unavailable. WCF The invocation of a WCF request. WebAPI The invocation of a WebAPI request. WebService The invocation of a WebService request. Node.JS Sub-type Description Custom The execution of the named custom transaction. Usually recorded via manual instrumentation APIs. Message Message broker or queue communication. PHP Sub-type Description Action The invocation of the named framework action. Used when the agent is able to identify a framework-specific action name. Custom The execution of the named custom transaction. Usually recorded via manual instrumentation APIs. Function The invocation of the named function. PHP The invocation of a background PHP job. StatusCode The HTTP status code returned for the transaction. Often used when a more specific transaction sub-type is unavailable. unknown The invocation of an unknown web transaction or background job. URI The invocation of the named URI. Usually used when a framework or language level transaction name cannot be determined. Python Sub-type Description ASGIWeb WebTransaction from an ASGI application. Message Message broker or queue communication. WSGIWeb WebTransaction from a WSGI application. Ruby Sub-type Description Custom The execution of the named custom transaction. Usually recorded via manual instrumentation APIs. Transaction segments The individual functions and calls that make up a transaction are called segments. For example external service calls and database calls are segments, and both have their own UI pages in APM. The APM Transactions page displays aggregate transaction segment data. To add segments to a transaction, use custom instrumentation. To see the segments of a specific transaction, use transaction traces. Transaction naming For supported frameworks, transaction names can come from various sources, such as the name given to the transaction by the framework, function names detected during the transaction, or a web request's URL. For transactions that produce many names with a similar format, we consolidate those into general transaction categories. For example, a transaction might be displayed as /user/*/control_panel, where the * represents different user names. To rename transactions or adjust how names are consolidated, use custom instrumentation.

Trace details page functions Go to one.newrelic.com > APM > (select an app) > Monitor > Transactions > (select a transaction trace) > Trace details. The Trace details page displays a table with the timing data for the segments in a transaction, plus additional features and functions: Trace details page Description Primary trace data, functions The top of each transaction trace UI page shows several primary pieces of data, including the trace time, response time, and, if available, CPU info. Also, sometimes the UI may indicate a partial trace. Available functions include: Delete this trace: When you delete a trace, it cannot be retrieved. Track as key transaction. Duration column The duration of each segment and subsegment is shown as both the number of milliseconds and a percentage of the total transaction time. Especially slow segments are color-coded. Segment column The Segment column displays segment names and counts. Fast and repeat calls may be automatically grouped together. Sometimes you may see Application code as the name of a segment or subsegment. To expand segments, use either of the following: The Expand performance problems button at the top of the page The expand and collapse dropdown arrows next to the segments Drilldown column The Drilldown column may contain icons that link to additional transaction data, if available. Timestamp column The Timestamp column displays the start time of a segment or subsegment, relative to the start of the transaction. For example, a value of 3.150 s indicates that that segment started 3.15 seconds into the transaction. Drilldown options In the Drilldown column, icons indicate that additional data is available: Icon Description Database queries The database icon links to the raw database query for that query segment. Depending on your transaction trace settings, this query can either show as raw data or obfuscated data. If the total time for the segment exceeds the query plan threshold in your settings, the query analysis also will appear, along with a stack trace showing the exact location of the call in your code. Stack traces The magnifying glass links to stack trace details. Aggregate transaction details This icon indicates that cross application tracing details are not available. However, you can select this icon to view aggregated transaction information across multiple invocations of the transaction. Examine logs for trace details You can bring your logs and application's data together to make troubleshooting easier and faster. With logs in context, you can see log messages related to your errors and traces directly in your app's UI. From the Transactions page, click on a trace to go to the Trace details page. From the trace details page, click See logs. To view details related to an individual log message, click directly on the message. With logs in context, you can examine log data directly within your trace details. You can also see logs in context of your infrastructure data, such as Kubernetes clusters. No need to switch to another UI page in New Relic One. Color coding of segment duration data The Duration column of the Trace details table is color-coded: Red: More than 25% of the total transaction time was spent in this segment. Yellow: More than 5% of the total transaction time was spent in this segment. Color-coded durations do not necessarily indicate a problem. Whether the timing is actually a problem depends on what you consider normal and acceptable for your application. Application code in traces If a segment is listed as Application code in the table, it indicates that that section of code was not instrumented. You can use custom instrumentation to get more detail on that part of the code. Segments will often be listed as Application code for partial traces. Partial traces For performance reasons, APM only captures the first 2,000 segments of a transaction trace (900 for Node.js). If a transaction trace exceeds that number of segments, the agent truncates the transaction trace and displays a message at the top of the Details page: This is a partial trace. The APM agents have differing rules for when to truncate segments. APM agent Truncate segment rules C SDK Truncates based on segment priority: The root segment has the highest priority. Segments that have seen distributed tracing activity have second-highest priority. Slow segments have third-highest priority. For more information, see the C SDK's documentation about newrelic_transaction_tracer_config_t on GitHub. Go The segment duration must be greater than the TransactionTracer.SegmentThreshold value set in your Go segment configuration. Java, .NET, Ruby These agents truncate traces chronologically. For more information, see the transaction tracer documentation for Java, .NET, or Ruby as applicable. Node.js The Node.js agent only captures the first 900 segments of a transaction trace. For more information, see Node.js transaction tracer configuration. PHP Truncates based on segment duration; the slowest 2,000 segments are captured for the trace. For more information, see PHP transaction tracer configuration. Python Truncates based on segment duration; the slowest 2,000 segments are captured for the trace. For more information, see Python transaction tracer configuration. Segment grouping rules Transaction traces that have a lot of segments can be hard to interpret. New Relic helps you by automatically grouping fast and/or repeated method calls into a single segment grouping. For example, you might see a segment titled 7 fast method calls. This means that, because of their fast completion, New Relic assumed these calls were unlikely to be a problem and grouped them together. You can expand that grouping to see the individual segments. Rules underlying segment grouping include: Fast calls: When New Relic detects four or more consecutive segments with a duration of 7.5 ms or less, these are grouped into a single collapsed header. Identical calls: When New Relic detects four or more consecutive identical calls, this usually indicates an N+1 problem. These segments are collapsed. Expanding the collapsed node displays only the first three calls, not all calls.",

      "body": "This document explains what non-web transactions are in APM, and how you can instrument background tasks and other arbitrary activity to be reported as non-web transactions. What are non-web transactions? The two main APM transaction categories are web and non-web. Web transactions are transactions we detect as being initiated by a web request; they are the most common type of transaction reported by APM. Non-web transactions are transactions that are not web transactions; we do not detect they were initiated by a web request. This includes processes and jobs that do not handle web requests, such as message processing and background tasks. For example, you might schedule something to run periodically on your server to do database work, send emails, etc. The source is not a web request but something on your server. Some non-web transactions from supported frameworks or services are detected automatically by New Relic; others may be created using custom instrumentation. We intentionally separate your web and non-web transactions in the UI. Non-web vs. web transactions Comments Less directly important Non-web transactions are often background processes and tasks, and they are less directly important to your application's users when compared to web transactions. Long running Non-web transactions are often long-running processes. Separating them from web transactions prevents those results from skewing your customer-facing response times. Omitted from Apdex score Combining your non-web transactions with your web transactions would hurt your Apdex score (a measure of satisfaction with load times). This is why Apdex data for non-web transactions does not appear in the UI. Create non-web transactions To create new non-web transactions, follow the procedures for your APM language agent. C SDK Follow the procedures for instrumenting a non-web transaction. Go Follow the procedures for instrumenting a non-web transaction. Java Follow the procedures for instrumenting a transaction (instrumenting a transaction without web request parameters creates a non-web transaction). .NET By default, the APM .NET agent instruments IIS ASP workers. To instrument other (non-IIS) .NET applications, such as standalone (WCF) services, console apps, and other Windows services, see Instrumenting custom applications and Instrumenting WCF applications. Important For IIS applications, you cannot change web transactions to non-web transactions. Node.js Use startBackgroundTransaction(). PHP To mark a transaction as non-web: use newrelic_background_job and set the flag to true. The PHP agent reports all command-line run scripts as non-web transactions. Python See Python agent non-web transactions. The Python agent also supports non-web transaction reporting from Celery and Gearman. Ruby See Ruby agent non-web transactions. View non-web transactions To view non-web transaction data in the New Relic UI, go to the main chart on the following pages, and then select the Non-web option in the dropdown: New Relic Explorer: Go to one.newrelic.com > Explorer > (select an app) > Summary. APM: Go to one.newrelic.com > APM > (select an app) > Summary. Transactions: Go to one.newrelic.com > APM > (select an app) > Monitor > Transactions.",

      "body": "In APM, the Trace details tab shows the timing of individual segments in a transaction trace. This document describes the sections and features of the Trace details tab. Trace details page functions Go to one.newrelic.com > APM > (select an app) > Monitor > Transactions > (select a transaction trace) > Trace details. The Trace details page displays a table with the timing data for the segments in a transaction, plus additional features and functions: Trace details page Description Primary trace data, functions The top of each transaction trace UI page shows several primary pieces of data, including the trace time, response time, and, if available, CPU info. Also, sometimes the UI may indicate a partial trace. Available functions include: Delete this trace: When you delete a trace, it cannot be retrieved. Track as key transaction. Duration column The duration of each segment and subsegment is shown as both the number of milliseconds and a percentage of the total transaction time. Especially slow segments are color-coded. Segment column The Segment column displays segment names and counts. Fast and repeat calls may be automatically grouped together. Sometimes you may see Application code as the name of a segment or subsegment. To expand segments, use either of the following: The Expand performance problems button at the top of the page The expand and collapse dropdown arrows next to the segments Drilldown column The Drilldown column may contain icons that link to additional transaction data, if available. Timestamp column The Timestamp column displays the start time of a segment or subsegment, relative to the start of the transaction. For example, a value of 3.150 s indicates that that segment started 3.15 seconds into the transaction. Drilldown options In the Drilldown column, icons indicate that additional data is available: Icon Description Database queries The database icon links to the raw database query for that query segment. Depending on your transaction trace settings, this query can either show as raw data or obfuscated data. If the total time for the segment exceeds the query plan threshold in your settings, the query analysis also will appear, along with a stack trace showing the exact location of the call in your code. Stack traces The magnifying glass links to stack trace details. Aggregate transaction details This icon indicates that cross application tracing details are not available. However, you can select this icon to view aggregated transaction information across multiple invocations of the transaction. Examine logs for trace details You can bring your logs and application's data together to make troubleshooting easier and faster. With logs in context, you can see log messages related to your errors and traces directly in your app's UI. From the Transactions page, click on a trace to go to the Trace details page. From the trace details page, click See logs. To view details related to an individual log message, click directly on the message. With logs in context, you can examine log data directly within your trace details. You can also see logs in context of your infrastructure data, such as Kubernetes clusters. No need to switch to another UI page in New Relic One. Color coding of segment duration data The Duration column of the Trace details table is color-coded: Red: More than 25% of the total transaction time was spent in this segment. Yellow: More than 5% of the total transaction time was spent in this segment. Color-coded durations do not necessarily indicate a problem. Whether the timing is actually a problem depends on what you consider normal and acceptable for your application. Application code in traces If a segment is listed as Application code in the table, it indicates that that section of code was not instrumented. You can use custom instrumentation to get more detail on that part of the code. Segments will often be listed as Application code for partial traces. Partial traces For performance reasons, APM only captures the first 2,000 segments of a transaction trace (900 for Node.js). If a transaction trace exceeds that number of segments, the agent truncates the transaction trace and displays a message at the top of the Details page: This is a partial trace. The APM agents have differing rules for when to truncate segments. APM agent Truncate segment rules C SDK Truncates based on segment priority: The root segment has the highest priority. Segments that have seen distributed tracing activity have second-highest priority. Slow segments have third-highest priority. For more information, see the C SDK's documentation about newrelic_transaction_tracer_config_t on GitHub. Go The segment duration must be greater than the TransactionTracer.SegmentThreshold value set in your Go segment configuration. Java, .NET, Ruby These agents truncate traces chronologically. For more information, see the transaction tracer documentation for Java, .NET, or Ruby as applicable. Node.js The Node.js agent only captures the first 900 segments of a transaction trace. For more information, see Node.js transaction tracer configuration. PHP Truncates based on segment duration; the slowest 2,000 segments are captured for the trace. For more information, see PHP transaction tracer configuration. Python Truncates based on segment duration; the slowest 2,000 segments are captured for the trace. For more information, see Python transaction tracer configuration. Segment grouping rules Transaction traces that have a lot of segments can be hard to interpret. New Relic helps you by automatically grouping fast and/or repeated method calls into a single segment grouping. For example, you might see a segment titled 7 fast method calls. This means that, because of their fast completion, New Relic assumed these calls were unlikely to be a problem and grouped them together. You can expand that grouping to see the individual segments. Rules underlying segment grouping include: Fast calls: When New Relic detects four or more consecutive segments with a duration of 7.5 ms or less, these are grouped into a single collapsed header. Identical calls: When New Relic detects four or more consecutive identical calls, this usually indicates an N+1 problem. These segments are collapsed. Expanding the collapsed node displays only the first three calls, not all calls.",

These may be web transactions or non-web transactions that are important to your business. For most New Relic agents, a key transaction can be any type of transaction. For the PHP, Node.js, and Go agents, only web transactions can be turned into key transactions. What are key transactions? In APM, making a transaction a key transaction gives you the following benefits: Key transactions are grouped together in the New Relic UI, so they are easy to find and examine. You can set a custom Apdex threshold for a key transaction. You can set an alert policy for a key transaction. Key transactions are useful for: Important transactions. For your app's most important transactions, making them key transactions means you can quickly find and examine them. You can set stricter Apdex requirements for them, and you can create alert policies for them. Slow transactions. If a transaction is regularly slower than other transactions, it can bring down the Apdex score of the entire application. When you make a transaction a key transaction, you can set a longer-duration Apdex threshold for it so it won't bring down your app's Apdex score. Create key transactions To create key transactions, see Create and update key transactions.

For most New Relic agents, a key transaction can be any type of transaction. For the PHP, Node.js, and Go agents, only web transactions can be turned into key transactions. Create key transactions There are two ways to create a key transaction: From the key transaction index Go to one.newrelic.com > More > Key transactions to view the key transactions index. Select Add more. From a specific transaction page Go to one.newrelic.com > APM > (select an app) > Summary In the center of the page under Transactions, select a record. Select Track as key transaction. Rename a key transaction Here's how to rename: Go to one.newrelic.com > More > Key transactions. From the index, select the gear icon for the key transaction you want to rename. Enter a new name for the transaction, then save. Change Apdex settings You can set a custom Apdex threshold for a key transaction if it is a web transaction. (Apdex is not applicable for non-web-transactions.) This is useful if the transaction is expected to be faster or slower than other transactions. Important Key transaction Apdex settings override the T value set for that app. This can mean, for example, that a key transaction could be reported as Satisfied but a different transaction in the same app with the same response time could be Frustrated. To change a key transaction's Apdex threshold: Go to one.newrelic.com > More > Key transactions. Select the icon for the transaction you want to edit. Enter a new value in seconds under the Apdex T heading, then save. The Apdex threshold affects how key transaction traces are created. Delete key transactions To delete a key transaction: Go to one.newrelic.com > More > Key transactions. Select the gear icon for the key transaction you want to delete. Select Stop tracking. New Relic automatically deletes any associated alerts and events for the deleted key transaction.",

In APM, making a transaction a key transaction gives you the following benefits: Key transactions are grouped together in the New Relic UI, so they are easy to find and examine. You can set a custom Apdex threshold for a key transaction. You can set an alert policy for a key transaction. Key transactions are useful for: Important transactions. For your app's most important transactions, making them key transactions means you can quickly find and examine them. You can set stricter Apdex requirements for them, and you can create alert policies for them. Slow transactions. If a transaction is regularly slower than other transactions, it can bring down the Apdex score of the entire application.

These may be web transactions or non-web transactions that are important to your business. For most New Relic agents, a key transaction can be any type of transaction. For the PHP, Node.js, and Go agents, only web transactions can be turned into key transactions. What are key transactions? In APM, making a transaction a key transaction gives you the following benefits: Key transactions are grouped together in the New Relic UI, so they are easy to find and examine. You can set a custom Apdex threshold for a key transaction. You can set an alert policy for a key transaction. Key transactions are useful for: Important transactions. For your app's most important transactions, making them key transactions means you can quickly find and examine them. You can set stricter Apdex requirements for them, and you can create alert policies for them. Slow transactions. If a transaction is regularly slower than other transactions, it can bring down the Apdex score of the entire application. When you make a transaction a key transaction, you can set a longer-duration Apdex threshold for it so it won't bring down your app's Apdex score. Create key transactions To create key transactions, see Create and update key transactions. View key transactions in UI The key transaction's page includes response time and throughput charts, service-level agreement information, a cross application tracing map (if available), and links to alert policy options.

      "body": "In APM, the Trace details tab shows the timing of individual segments in a transaction trace. This document describes the sections and features of the Trace details tab. Trace details page functions Go to one.newrelic.com > APM > (select an app) > Monitor > Transactions > (select a transaction trace) > Trace details. The Trace details page displays a table with the timing data for the segments in a transaction, plus additional features and functions: Trace details page Description Primary trace data, functions The top of each transaction trace UI page shows several primary pieces of data, including the trace time, response time, and, if available, CPU info. Also, sometimes the UI may indicate a partial trace. Available functions include: Delete this trace: When you delete a trace, it cannot be retrieved. Track as key transaction. Duration column The duration of each segment and subsegment is shown as both the number of milliseconds and a percentage of the total transaction time. Especially slow segments are color-coded. Segment column The Segment column displays segment names and counts. Fast and repeat calls may be automatically grouped together. Sometimes you may see Application code as the name of a segment or subsegment. To expand segments, use either of the following: The Expand performance problems button at the top of the page The expand and collapse dropdown arrows next to the segments Drilldown column The Drilldown column may contain icons that link to additional transaction data, if available. Timestamp column The Timestamp column displays the start time of a segment or subsegment, relative to the start of the transaction. For example, a value of 3.150 s indicates that that segment started 3.15 seconds into the transaction. Drilldown options In the Drilldown column, icons indicate that additional data is available: Icon Description Database queries The database icon links to the raw database query for that query segment. Depending on your transaction trace settings, this query can either show as raw data or obfuscated data. If the total time for the segment exceeds the query plan threshold in your settings, the query analysis also will appear, along with a stack trace showing the exact location of the call in your code. Stack traces The magnifying glass links to stack trace details. Aggregate transaction details This icon indicates that cross application tracing details are not available. However, you can select this icon to view aggregated transaction information across multiple invocations of the transaction. Examine logs for trace details You can bring your logs and application's data together to make troubleshooting easier and faster. With logs in context, you can see log messages related to your errors and traces directly in your app's UI. From the Transactions page, click on a trace to go to the Trace details page. From the trace details page, click See logs. To view details related to an individual log message, click directly on the message. With logs in context, you can examine log data directly within your trace details. You can also see logs in context of your infrastructure data, such as Kubernetes clusters. No need to switch to another UI page in New Relic One. Color coding of segment duration data The Duration column of the Trace details table is color-coded: Red: More than 25% of the total transaction time was spent in this segment. Yellow: More than 5% of the total transaction time was spent in this segment. Color-coded durations do not necessarily indicate a problem. Whether the timing is actually a problem depends on what you consider normal and acceptable for your application. Application code in traces If a segment is listed as Application code in the table, it indicates that that section of code was not instrumented. You can use custom instrumentation to get more detail on that part of the code. Segments will often be listed as Application code for partial traces. Partial traces For performance reasons, APM only captures the first 2,000 segments of a transaction trace (900 for Node.js). If a transaction trace exceeds that number of segments, the agent truncates the transaction trace and displays a message at the top of the Details page: This is a partial trace. The APM agents have differing rules for when to truncate segments. APM agent Truncate segment rules C SDK Truncates based on segment priority: The root segment has the highest priority. Segments that have seen distributed tracing activity have second-highest priority. Slow segments have third-highest priority. For more information, see the C SDK's documentation about newrelic_transaction_tracer_config_t on GitHub. Go The segment duration must be greater than the TransactionTracer.SegmentThreshold value set in your Go segment configuration. Java, .NET, Ruby These agents truncate traces chronologically. For more information, see the transaction tracer documentation for Java, .NET, or Ruby as applicable. Node.js The Node.js agent only captures the first 900 segments of a transaction trace. For more information, see Node.js transaction tracer configuration. PHP Truncates based on segment duration; the slowest 2,000 segments are captured for the trace. For more information, see PHP transaction tracer configuration. Python Truncates based on segment duration; the slowest 2,000 segments are captured for the trace. For more information, see Python transaction tracer configuration. Segment grouping rules Transaction traces that have a lot of segments can be hard to interpret. New Relic helps you by automatically grouping fast and/or repeated method calls into a single segment grouping. For example, you might see a segment titled 7 fast method calls. This means that, because of their fast completion, New Relic assumed these calls were unlikely to be a problem and grouped them together. You can expand that grouping to see the individual segments. Rules underlying segment grouping include: Fast calls: When New Relic detects four or more consecutive segments with a duration of 7.5 ms or less, these are grouped into a single collapsed header. Identical calls: When New Relic detects four or more consecutive identical calls, this usually indicates an N+1 problem. These segments are collapsed. Expanding the collapsed node displays only the first three calls, not all calls.",

      "body": "In APM, a transaction trace gives a detailed snapshot of a single transaction in your application. A transaction trace records the available function calls, database calls, and external calls. You can use transaction traces to troubleshoot performance issues and to get detailed low-level insight into how your app is working. What transactions record traces In APM, a transaction trace records the segments that make up a transaction. Because they give you more detail, you can use transaction traces to analyze and troubleshoot performance issues. Here are the default rules that govern which transactions a New Relic agent traces: Over the minute-long harvest cycle, all transactions that violate the threshold (either four times your Apdex T value or a specific number of seconds) are added to a pool of transactions. At the end of that minute, the New Relic agent selects the slowest transaction in that pool and performs a transaction trace on it. These are the general rules, but there are some agent-specific differences. For example: The Java agent collects occasional non-slow transactions. If one transaction is frequently traced, some agents will select other transactions to give a more diverse sampling. If you don't see traces in your account, it's possible that no transactions meet the necessary criteria. In this situation, you can adjust transaction trace settings to ensure some transactions will be traced. If you use Synthetic, you will likely have Synthetic monitor traces. Synthetic traces can happen more frequently than APM traces, potentially several per minute. Configure transaction traces To configure or edit trace settings, see the procedures for: Transaction traces Key transaction traces View transaction traces in UI To view transaction traces: Do one of the following: New Relic Explorer: Go to one.newrelic.com > Explorer > (select an app) > Monitor > Transactions. APM: Go to one.newrelic.com > APM > (select an app) > Monitor > Transactions. In the Transaction traces section, click transaction traces to view additional details. Examine logs for trace details You can bring your logs and application's data together to make troubleshooting easier and faster. With logs in context, you can see log messages related to your errors and traces directly in your app's UI. From the Transactions page, click on a trace to go to the Trace details page. From the trace details page, click See logs. To view details related to an individual log message, click directly on the message. You can also see logs in context of your infrastructure data, such as Kubernetes clusters. No need to switch to another UI page in New Relic One. Troubleshoot an issue with transaction traces If you expect to see transaction traces but do not see them, follow the troubleshooting procedures.

Trace details page functions Go to one.newrelic.com > APM > (select an app) > Monitor > Transactions > (select a transaction trace) > Trace details. The Trace details page displays a table with the timing data for the segments in a transaction, plus additional features and functions: Trace details page Description Primary trace data, functions The top of each transaction trace UI page shows several primary pieces of data, including the trace time, response time, and, if available, CPU info. Also, sometimes the UI may indicate a partial trace. Available functions include: Delete this trace: When you delete a trace, it cannot be retrieved. Track as key transaction. Duration column The duration of each segment and subsegment is shown as both the number of milliseconds and a percentage of the total transaction time. Especially slow segments are color-coded. Segment column The Segment column displays segment names and counts. Fast and repeat calls may be automatically grouped together. Sometimes you may see Application code as the name of a segment or subsegment. To expand segments, use either of the following: The Expand performance problems button at the top of the page The expand and collapse dropdown arrows next to the segments Drilldown column The Drilldown column may contain icons that link to additional transaction data, if available. Timestamp column The Timestamp column displays the start time of a segment or subsegment, relative to the start of the transaction. For example, a value of 3.150 s indicates that that segment started 3.15 seconds into the transaction. Drilldown options In the Drilldown column, icons indicate that additional data is available: Icon Description Database queries The database icon links to the raw database query for that query segment. Depending on your transaction trace settings, this query can either show as raw data or obfuscated data. If the total time for the segment exceeds the query plan threshold in your settings, the query analysis also will appear, along with a stack trace showing the exact location of the call in your code. Stack traces The magnifying glass links to stack trace details. Aggregate transaction details This icon indicates that cross application tracing details are not available.

With logs in context, you can examine log data directly within your trace details. You can also see logs in context of your infrastructure data, such as Kubernetes clusters. No need to switch to another UI page in New Relic One. Color coding of segment duration data The Duration column of the Trace details table is color-coded: Red: More than 25% of the total transaction time was spent in this segment. Yellow: More than 5% of the total transaction time was spent in this segment. Color-coded durations do not necessarily indicate a problem. Whether the timing is actually a problem depends on what you consider normal and acceptable for your application. Application code in traces If a segment is listed as Application code in the table, it indicates that that section of code was not instrumented. You can use custom instrumentation to get more detail on that part of the code. Segments will often be listed as Application code for partial traces. Partial traces For performance reasons, APM only captures the first 2,000 segments of a transaction trace (900 for Node.js). If a transaction trace exceeds that number of segments, the agent truncates the transaction trace and displays a message at the top of the Details page: This is a partial trace. The APM agents have differing rules for when to truncate segments. APM agent Truncate segment rules C SDK Truncates based on segment priority: The root segment has the highest priority. Segments that have seen distributed tracing activity have second-highest priority. Slow segments have third-highest priority. For more information, see the C SDK's documentation about newrelic_transaction_tracer_config_t on GitHub. Go The segment duration must be greater than the TransactionTracer.SegmentThreshold value set in your Go segment configuration. Java, .NET, Ruby These agents truncate traces chronologically. For more information, see the transaction tracer documentation for Java, .NET, or Ruby as applicable. Node.js The Node.js agent only captures the first 900 segments of a transaction trace. For more information, see Node.js transaction tracer configuration. PHP Truncates based on segment duration; the slowest 2,000 segments are captured for the trace. For more information, see PHP transaction tracer configuration. Python Truncates based on segment duration; the slowest 2,000 segments are captured for the trace. For more information, see Python transaction tracer configuration. Segment grouping rules Transaction traces that have a lot of segments can be hard to interpret. New Relic helps you by automatically grouping fast and/or repeated method calls into a single segment grouping. For example, you might see a segment titled 7 fast method calls. This means that, because of their fast completion, New Relic assumed these calls were unlikely to be a problem and grouped them together. You can expand that grouping to see the individual segments. Rules underlying segment grouping include: Fast calls: When New Relic detects four or more consecutive segments with a duration of 7.5 ms or less, these are grouped into a single collapsed header. Identical calls: When New Relic detects four or more consecutive identical calls, this usually indicates an N+1 problem. These segments are collapsed. Expanding the collapsed node displays only the first three calls, not all calls.",

Configure transaction trace settings via agent You can customize your transaction trace settings via New Relic agent configuration files and other \"local\" configuration methods such as environment variables. For more information about transaction trace configuration options, see the specific New Relic language agent's documentation: C SDK Go Java .NET Node PHP Python Ruby Configure transaction traces using server-side configuration The ability to configure transaction traces using server-side configuration depends on the New Relic agent. If server-side configuration is not supported, the transaction trace settings will be visible in the UI but not editable. If server-side configuration settings are available for your New Relic agent, you can see them at the following: one.newrelic.com > APM > (select an app) > Settings > Application > Server-side agent configuration. Transaction trace settings available using server-side configuration will differ depending on the New Relic agent you use. The UI includes descriptions of each. Settings in the UI may include: Transaction tracing and threshold Record SQL, including recording level and input fields Log SQL and stack trace threshold SQL query plans and threshold Error collection, including HTTP code and error class Slow query tracing Thread profiler Cross application tracing Configure traces for specific (key) transactions If you want to monitor or alert on a transaction differently than other transactions, make it a key transaction. This is useful, for example, when you want to set a transaction-specific Apdex that is different from your general Apdex T threshold. Changing a key transaction's Apdex changes the likelihood that it creates a transaction trace. For example: If you want to make it more likely a key transaction would generate transaction traces, lower its Apdex T value. If you want to make a key transaction less likely to be traced, raise its Apdex T value. Important If you have the transaction trace threshold set to a number of seconds, and not to the default Apdex setting, the number-of-seconds threshold will act as the threshold for all transactions, even for key transactions that have custom Apdex settings. View logs for your APM and infrastructure data You can also bring your logs and application's data together to make troubleshooting easier and faster.

No need to switch to another UI page in New Relic One. Create custom transactions You can create custom transactions for app activity that isn't being automatically captured as a transaction by the New Relic agent. For more information, see Custom instrumentation. Collect HTTP request attributes, parameters For data security reasons, transaction traces do not collect potentially sensitive HTTP request attributes, sometimes called parameters. Traces do collect some basic HTTP request attributes, which New Relic calls agent attributes. To edit attribute collection settings, see the specific New Relic agent: C SDK Go Java .NET Node.js (does not allow HTTP attribute configuration) PHP Python Ruby For more information, see Collect custom attributes. Delete a transaction trace When you delete a transaction trace, it is deleted permanently. Delete a single transaction trace To delete a transaction trace record permanently: Go to one.newrelic.com > APM > (select an app) > Monitor > Transactions. Under Transaction traces click on the trace you want to delete. On the details page, select Delete this trace. Delete all transaction traces To delete all traces for the selected app permanently: Go to one.newrelic.com > APM > (select an app) > Monitor > Transactions. Click Delete all traces. It may take fifteen minutes or more for all transaction trace records to disappear from the UI. To delete all traces for your account, contact us at support.newrelic.com. Tip If you are doing general record cleanup, you may also want to delete databases and slow query traces or error traces. This will remove potentially sensitive data while retaining your other application data (such as Apdex, deployment information, etc.).",

Configure transaction trace settings via agent You can customize your transaction trace settings via New Relic agent configuration files and other \"local\" configuration methods such as environment variables. For more information about transaction trace configuration options, see the specific New Relic language agent's documentation: C SDK Go Java .NET Node PHP Python Ruby Configure transaction traces using server-side configuration The ability to configure transaction traces using server-side configuration depends on the New Relic agent. If server-side configuration is not supported, the transaction trace settings will be visible in the UI but not editable. If server-side configuration settings are available for your New Relic agent, you can see them at the following: one.newrelic.com > APM > (select an app) > Settings > Application > Server-side agent configuration. Transaction trace settings available using server-side configuration will differ depending on the New Relic agent you use. The UI includes descriptions of each. Settings in the UI may include: Transaction tracing and threshold Record SQL, including recording level and input fields Log SQL and stack trace threshold SQL query plans and threshold Error collection, including HTTP code and error class Slow query tracing Thread profiler Cross application tracing Configure traces for specific (key) transactions If you want to monitor or alert on a transaction differently than other transactions, make it a key transaction. This is useful, for example, when you want to set a transaction-specific Apdex that is different from your general Apdex T threshold. Changing a key transaction's Apdex changes the likelihood that it creates a transaction trace. For example: If you want to make it more likely a key transaction would generate transaction traces, lower its Apdex T value. If you want to make a key transaction less likely to be traced, raise its Apdex T value. Important If you have the transaction trace threshold set to a number of seconds, and not to the default Apdex setting, the number-of-seconds threshold will act as the threshold for all transactions, even for key transactions that have custom Apdex settings. View logs for your APM and infrastructure data You can also bring your logs and application's data together to make troubleshooting easier and faster.

No need to switch to another UI page in New Relic One. Create custom transactions You can create custom transactions for app activity that isn't being automatically captured as a transaction by the New Relic agent. For more information, see Custom instrumentation. Collect HTTP request attributes, parameters For data security reasons, transaction traces do not collect potentially sensitive HTTP request attributes, sometimes called parameters. Traces do collect some basic HTTP request attributes, which New Relic calls agent attributes. To edit attribute collection settings, see the specific New Relic agent: C SDK Go Java .NET Node.js (does not allow HTTP attribute configuration) PHP Python Ruby For more information, see Collect custom attributes. Delete a transaction trace When you delete a transaction trace, it is deleted permanently. Delete a single transaction trace To delete a transaction trace record permanently: Go to one.newrelic.com > APM > (select an app) > Monitor > Transactions. Under Transaction traces click on the trace you want to delete. On the details page, select Delete this trace. Delete all transaction traces To delete all traces for the selected app permanently: Go to one.newrelic.com > APM > (select an app) > Monitor > Transactions. Click Delete all traces. It may take fifteen minutes or more for all transaction trace records to disappear from the UI. To delete all traces for your account, contact us at support.newrelic.com. Tip If you are doing general record cleanup, you may also want to delete databases and slow query traces or error traces. This will remove potentially sensitive data while retaining your other application data (such as Apdex, deployment information, etc.).",

Trace details page functions Go to one.newrelic.com > APM > (select an app) > Monitor > Transactions > (select a transaction trace) > Trace details. The Trace details page displays a table with the timing data for the segments in a transaction, plus additional features and functions: Trace details page Description Primary trace data, functions The top of each transaction trace UI page shows several primary pieces of data, including the trace time, response time, and, if available, CPU info. Also, sometimes the UI may indicate a partial trace. Available functions include: Delete this trace: When you delete a trace, it cannot be retrieved. Track as key transaction. Duration column The duration of each segment and subsegment is shown as both the number of milliseconds and a percentage of the total transaction time. Especially slow segments are color-coded. Segment column The Segment column displays segment names and counts. Fast and repeat calls may be automatically grouped together. Sometimes you may see Application code as the name of a segment or subsegment. To expand segments, use either of the following: The Expand performance problems button at the top of the page The expand and collapse dropdown arrows next to the segments Drilldown column The Drilldown column may contain icons that link to additional transaction data, if available. Timestamp column The Timestamp column displays the start time of a segment or subsegment, relative to the start of the transaction. For example, a value of 3.150 s indicates that that segment started 3.15 seconds into the transaction. Drilldown options In the Drilldown column, icons indicate that additional data is available: Icon Description Database queries The database icon links to the raw database query for that query segment. Depending on your transaction trace settings, this query can either show as raw data or obfuscated data. If the total time for the segment exceeds the query plan threshold in your settings, the query analysis also will appear, along with a stack trace showing the exact location of the call in your code. Stack traces The magnifying glass links to stack trace details. Aggregate transaction details This icon indicates that cross application tracing details are not available. However, you can select this icon to view aggregated transaction information across multiple invocations of the transaction. Examine logs for trace details You can bring your logs and application's data together to make troubleshooting easier and faster. With logs in context, you can see log messages related to your errors and traces directly in your app's UI. From the Transactions page, click on a trace to go to the Trace details page. From the trace details page, click See logs. To view details related to an individual log message, click directly on the message. With logs in context, you can examine log data directly within your trace details. You can also see logs in context of your infrastructure data, such as Kubernetes clusters. No need to switch to another UI page in New Relic One. Color coding of segment duration data The Duration column of the Trace details table is color-coded: Red: More than 25% of the total transaction time was spent in this segment. Yellow: More than 5% of the total transaction time was spent in this segment. Color-coded durations do not necessarily indicate a problem. Whether the timing is actually a problem depends on what you consider normal and acceptable for your application. Application code in traces If a segment is listed as Application code in the table, it indicates that that section of code was not instrumented. You can use custom instrumentation to get more detail on that part of the code. Segments will often be listed as Application code for partial traces. Partial traces For performance reasons, APM only captures the first 2,000 segments of a transaction trace (900 for Node.js). If a transaction trace exceeds that number of segments, the agent truncates the transaction trace and displays a message at the top of the Details page: This is a partial trace. The APM agents have differing rules for when to truncate segments. APM agent Truncate segment rules C SDK Truncates based on segment priority: The root segment has the highest priority. Segments that have seen distributed tracing activity have second-highest priority. Slow segments have third-highest priority. For more information, see the C SDK's documentation about newrelic_transaction_tracer_config_t on GitHub. Go The segment duration must be greater than the TransactionTracer.SegmentThreshold value set in your Go segment configuration. Java, .NET, Ruby These agents truncate traces chronologically. For more information, see the transaction tracer documentation for Java, .NET, or Ruby as applicable. Node.js The Node.js agent only captures the first 900 segments of a transaction trace. For more information, see Node.js transaction tracer configuration. PHP Truncates based on segment duration; the slowest 2,000 segments are captured for the trace. For more information, see PHP transaction tracer configuration. Python Truncates based on segment duration; the slowest 2,000 segments are captured for the trace. For more information, see Python transaction tracer configuration. Segment grouping rules Transaction traces that have a lot of segments can be hard to interpret. New Relic helps you by automatically grouping fast and/or repeated method calls into a single segment grouping. For example, you might see a segment titled 7 fast method calls. This means that, because of their fast completion, New Relic assumed these calls were unlikely to be a problem and grouped them together. You can expand that grouping to see the individual segments. Rules underlying segment grouping include: Fast calls: When New Relic detects four or more consecutive segments with a duration of 7.5 ms or less, these are grouped into a single collapsed header. Identical calls: When New Relic detects four or more consecutive identical calls, this usually indicates an N+1 problem. These segments are collapsed. Expanding the collapsed node displays only the first three calls, not all calls.",

      "body": "In APM, the Trace details tab shows the timing of individual segments in a transaction trace. This document describes the sections and features of the Trace details tab. Trace details page functions Go to one.newrelic.com > APM > (select an app) > Monitor > Transactions > (select a transaction trace) > Trace details. The Trace details page displays a table with the timing data for the segments in a transaction, plus additional features and functions: Trace details page Description Primary trace data, functions The top of each transaction trace UI page shows several primary pieces of data, including the trace time, response time, and, if available, CPU info. Also, sometimes the UI may indicate a partial trace. Available functions include: Delete this trace: When you delete a trace, it cannot be retrieved. Track as key transaction. Duration column The duration of each segment and subsegment is shown as both the number of milliseconds and a percentage of the total transaction time. Especially slow segments are color-coded. Segment column The Segment column displays segment names and counts. Fast and repeat calls may be automatically grouped together. Sometimes you may see Application code as the name of a segment or subsegment. To expand segments, use either of the following: The Expand performance problems button at the top of the page The expand and collapse dropdown arrows next to the segments Drilldown column The Drilldown column may contain icons that link to additional transaction data, if available. Timestamp column The Timestamp column displays the start time of a segment or subsegment, relative to the start of the transaction. For example, a value of 3.150 s indicates that that segment started 3.15 seconds into the transaction. Drilldown options In the Drilldown column, icons indicate that additional data is available: Icon Description Database queries The database icon links to the raw database query for that query segment. Depending on your transaction trace settings, this query can either show as raw data or obfuscated data. If the total time for the segment exceeds the query plan threshold in your settings, the query analysis also will appear, along with a stack trace showing the exact location of the call in your code. Stack traces The magnifying glass links to stack trace details. Aggregate transaction details This icon indicates that cross application tracing details are not available. However, you can select this icon to view aggregated transaction information across multiple invocations of the transaction. Examine logs for trace details You can bring your logs and application's data together to make troubleshooting easier and faster. With logs in context, you can see log messages related to your errors and traces directly in your app's UI. From the Transactions page, click on a trace to go to the Trace details page. From the trace details page, click See logs. To view details related to an individual log message, click directly on the message. With logs in context, you can examine log data directly within your trace details. You can also see logs in context of your infrastructure data, such as Kubernetes clusters. No need to switch to another UI page in New Relic One. Color coding of segment duration data The Duration column of the Trace details table is color-coded: Red: More than 25% of the total transaction time was spent in this segment. Yellow: More than 5% of the total transaction time was spent in this segment. Color-coded durations do not necessarily indicate a problem. Whether the timing is actually a problem depends on what you consider normal and acceptable for your application. Application code in traces If a segment is listed as Application code in the table, it indicates that that section of code was not instrumented. You can use custom instrumentation to get more detail on that part of the code. Segments will often be listed as Application code for partial traces. Partial traces For performance reasons, APM only captures the first 2,000 segments of a transaction trace (900 for Node.js). If a transaction trace exceeds that number of segments, the agent truncates the transaction trace and displays a message at the top of the Details page: This is a partial trace. The APM agents have differing rules for when to truncate segments. APM agent Truncate segment rules C SDK Truncates based on segment priority: The root segment has the highest priority. Segments that have seen distributed tracing activity have second-highest priority. Slow segments have third-highest priority. For more information, see the C SDK's documentation about newrelic_transaction_tracer_config_t on GitHub. Go The segment duration must be greater than the TransactionTracer.SegmentThreshold value set in your Go segment configuration. Java, .NET, Ruby These agents truncate traces chronologically. For more information, see the transaction tracer documentation for Java, .NET, or Ruby as applicable. Node.js The Node.js agent only captures the first 900 segments of a transaction trace. For more information, see Node.js transaction tracer configuration. PHP Truncates based on segment duration; the slowest 2,000 segments are captured for the trace. For more information, see PHP transaction tracer configuration. Python Truncates based on segment duration; the slowest 2,000 segments are captured for the trace. For more information, see Python transaction tracer configuration. Segment grouping rules Transaction traces that have a lot of segments can be hard to interpret. New Relic helps you by automatically grouping fast and/or repeated method calls into a single segment grouping. For example, you might see a segment titled 7 fast method calls. This means that, because of their fast completion, New Relic assumed these calls were unlikely to be a problem and grouped them together. You can expand that grouping to see the individual segments. Rules underlying segment grouping include: Fast calls: When New Relic detects four or more consecutive segments with a duration of 7.5 ms or less, these are grouped into a single collapsed header. Identical calls: When New Relic detects four or more consecutive identical calls, this usually indicates an N+1 problem. These segments are collapsed. Expanding the collapsed node displays only the first three calls, not all calls.",

This is useful, for example, when you want to set a transaction-specific Apdex that is different from your general Apdex T threshold. Changing a key transaction's Apdex changes the likelihood that it creates a transaction trace.

If you want to make a key transaction less likely to be traced, raise its Apdex T value. Important If you have the transaction trace threshold set to a number of seconds, and not to the default Apdex setting, the number-of-seconds threshold will act as the threshold for all transactions, even for key transactions that have custom Apdex settings.

      "body": "In APM, a transaction trace gives a detailed snapshot of a single transaction in your application. A transaction trace records the available function calls, database calls, and external calls. You can use transaction traces to troubleshoot performance issues and to get detailed low-level insight into how your app is working. What transactions record traces In APM, a transaction trace records the segments that make up a transaction. Because they give you more detail, you can use transaction traces to analyze and troubleshoot performance issues. Here are the default rules that govern which transactions a New Relic agent traces: Over the minute-long harvest cycle, all transactions that violate the threshold (either four times your Apdex T value or a specific number of seconds) are added to a pool of transactions. At the end of that minute, the New Relic agent selects the slowest transaction in that pool and performs a transaction trace on it. These are the general rules, but there are some agent-specific differences. For example: The Java agent collects occasional non-slow transactions. If one transaction is frequently traced, some agents will select other transactions to give a more diverse sampling. If you don't see traces in your account, it's possible that no transactions meet the necessary criteria. In this situation, you can adjust transaction trace settings to ensure some transactions will be traced. If you use Synthetic, you will likely have Synthetic monitor traces. Synthetic traces can happen more frequently than APM traces, potentially several per minute. Configure transaction traces To configure or edit trace settings, see the procedures for: Transaction traces Key transaction traces View transaction traces in UI To view transaction traces: Do one of the following: New Relic Explorer: Go to one.newrelic.com > Explorer > (select an app) > Monitor > Transactions.

To edit attribute collection settings, see the specific New Relic agent: C SDK Go Java .NET Node.js (does not allow HTTP attribute configuration) PHP Python Ruby For more information, see Collect custom attributes. Delete a transaction trace When you delete a transaction trace, it is deleted permanently. Delete a single transaction trace To delete a transaction trace record permanently: Go to one.newrelic.com > APM > (select an app) > Monitor > Transactions. Under Transaction traces click on the trace you want to delete. On the details page, select Delete this trace. Delete all transaction traces To delete all traces for the selected app permanently: Go to one.newrelic.com > APM > (select an app) > Monitor > Transactions. Click Delete all traces. It may take fifteen minutes or more for all transaction trace records to disappear from the UI. To delete all traces for your account, contact us at support.newrelic.com. Tip If you are doing general record cleanup, you may also want to delete databases and slow query traces or error traces. This will remove potentially sensitive data while retaining your other application data (such as Apdex, deployment information, etc.).",

      "body": "In APM, a transaction trace gives a detailed snapshot of a single transaction in your application. A transaction trace records the available function calls, database calls, and external calls. You can use transaction traces to troubleshoot performance issues and to get detailed low-level insight into how your app is working. What transactions record traces In APM, a transaction trace records the segments that make up a transaction. Because they give you more detail, you can use transaction traces to analyze and troubleshoot performance issues. Here are the default rules that govern which transactions a New Relic agent traces: Over the minute-long harvest cycle, all transactions that violate the threshold (either four times your Apdex T value or a specific number of seconds) are added to a pool of transactions. At the end of that minute, the New Relic agent selects the slowest transaction in that pool and performs a transaction trace on it. These are the general rules, but there are some agent-specific differences. For example: The Java agent collects occasional non-slow transactions. If one transaction is frequently traced, some agents will select other transactions to give a more diverse sampling. If you don't see traces in your account, it's possible that no transactions meet the necessary criteria. In this situation, you can adjust transaction trace settings to ensure some transactions will be traced. If you use Synthetic, you will likely have Synthetic monitor traces. Synthetic traces can happen more frequently than APM traces, potentially several per minute. Configure transaction traces To configure or edit trace settings, see the procedures for: Transaction traces Key transaction traces View transaction traces in UI To view transaction traces: Do one of the following: New Relic Explorer: Go to one.newrelic.com > Explorer > (select an app) > Monitor > Transactions. APM: Go to one.newrelic.com > APM > (select an app) > Monitor > Transactions. In the Transaction traces section, click transaction traces to view additional details. Examine logs for trace details You can bring your logs and application's data together to make troubleshooting easier and faster. With logs in context, you can see log messages related to your errors and traces directly in your app's UI. From the Transactions page, click on a trace to go to the Trace details page. From the trace details page, click See logs. To view details related to an individual log message, click directly on the message. You can also see logs in context of your infrastructure data, such as Kubernetes clusters. No need to switch to another UI page in New Relic One. Troubleshoot an issue with transaction traces If you expect to see transaction traces but do not see them, follow the troubleshooting procedures.

Trace details page functions Go to one.newrelic.com > APM > (select an app) > Monitor > Transactions > (select a transaction trace) > Trace details. The Trace details page displays a table with the timing data for the segments in a transaction, plus additional features and functions: Trace details page Description Primary trace data, functions The top of each transaction trace UI page shows several primary pieces of data, including the trace time, response time, and, if available, CPU info. Also, sometimes the UI may indicate a partial trace. Available functions include: Delete this trace: When you delete a trace, it cannot be retrieved. Track as key transaction. Duration column The duration of each segment and subsegment is shown as both the number of milliseconds and a percentage of the total transaction time. Especially slow segments are color-coded. Segment column The Segment column displays segment names and counts. Fast and repeat calls may be automatically grouped together. Sometimes you may see Application code as the name of a segment or subsegment. To expand segments, use either of the following: The Expand performance problems button at the top of the page The expand and collapse dropdown arrows next to the segments Drilldown column The Drilldown column may contain icons that link to additional transaction data, if available. Timestamp column The Timestamp column displays the start time of a segment or subsegment, relative to the start of the transaction. For example, a value of 3.150 s indicates that that segment started 3.15 seconds into the transaction. Drilldown options In the Drilldown column, icons indicate that additional data is available: Icon Description Database queries The database icon links to the raw database query for that query segment. Depending on your transaction trace settings, this query can either show as raw data or obfuscated data. If the total time for the segment exceeds the query plan threshold in your settings, the query analysis also will appear, along with a stack trace showing the exact location of the call in your code. Stack traces The magnifying glass links to stack trace details. Aggregate transaction details This icon indicates that cross application tracing details are not available. However, you can select this icon to view aggregated transaction information across multiple invocations of the transaction. Examine logs for trace details You can bring your logs and application's data together to make troubleshooting easier and faster. With logs in context, you can see log messages related to your errors and traces directly in your app's UI. From the Transactions page, click on a trace to go to the Trace details page. From the trace details page, click See logs. To view details related to an individual log message, click directly on the message. With logs in context, you can examine log data directly within your trace details. You can also see logs in context of your infrastructure data, such as Kubernetes clusters. No need to switch to another UI page in New Relic One. Color coding of segment duration data The Duration column of the Trace details table is color-coded: Red: More than 25% of the total transaction time was spent in this segment. Yellow: More than 5% of the total transaction time was spent in this segment. Color-coded durations do not necessarily indicate a problem. Whether the timing is actually a problem depends on what you consider normal and acceptable for your application. Application code in traces If a segment is listed as Application code in the table, it indicates that that section of code was not instrumented. You can use custom instrumentation to get more detail on that part of the code. Segments will often be listed as Application code for partial traces. Partial traces For performance reasons, APM only captures the first 2,000 segments of a transaction trace (900 for Node.js). If a transaction trace exceeds that number of segments, the agent truncates the transaction trace and displays a message at the top of the Details page: This is a partial trace. The APM agents have differing rules for when to truncate segments. APM agent Truncate segment rules C SDK Truncates based on segment priority: The root segment has the highest priority. Segments that have seen distributed tracing activity have second-highest priority. Slow segments have third-highest priority. For more information, see the C SDK's documentation about newrelic_transaction_tracer_config_t on GitHub. Go The segment duration must be greater than the TransactionTracer.SegmentThreshold value set in your Go segment configuration. Java, .NET, Ruby These agents truncate traces chronologically. For more information, see the transaction tracer documentation for Java, .NET, or Ruby as applicable. Node.js The Node.js agent only captures the first 900 segments of a transaction trace. For more information, see Node.js transaction tracer configuration. PHP Truncates based on segment duration; the slowest 2,000 segments are captured for the trace. For more information, see PHP transaction tracer configuration. Python Truncates based on segment duration; the slowest 2,000 segments are captured for the trace. For more information, see Python transaction tracer configuration. Segment grouping rules Transaction traces that have a lot of segments can be hard to interpret. New Relic helps you by automatically grouping fast and/or repeated method calls into a single segment grouping. For example, you might see a segment titled 7 fast method calls. This means that, because of their fast completion, New Relic assumed these calls were unlikely to be a problem and grouped them together. You can expand that grouping to see the individual segments. Rules underlying segment grouping include: Fast calls: When New Relic detects four or more consecutive segments with a duration of 7.5 ms or less, these are grouped into a single collapsed header. Identical calls: When New Relic detects four or more consecutive identical calls, this usually indicates an N+1 problem. These segments are collapsed. Expanding the collapsed node displays only the first three calls, not all calls.",

For more information about transaction trace configuration options, see the specific New Relic language agent's documentation: C SDK Go Java .NET Node PHP Python Ruby Configure transaction traces using server-side configuration The ability to configure transaction traces using server-side configuration depends on the New Relic agent. If server-side configuration is not supported, the transaction trace settings will be visible in the UI but not editable. If server-side configuration settings are available for your New Relic agent, you can see them at the following: one.newrelic.com > APM > (select an app) > Settings > Application > Server-side agent configuration. Transaction trace settings available using server-side configuration will differ depending on the New Relic agent you use. The UI includes descriptions of each. Settings in the UI may include: Transaction tracing and threshold Record SQL, including recording level and input fields Log SQL and stack trace threshold SQL query plans and threshold Error collection, including HTTP code and error class Slow query tracing Thread profiler Cross application tracing Configure traces for specific (key) transactions If you want to monitor or alert on a transaction differently than other transactions, make it a key transaction. This is useful, for example, when you want to set a transaction-specific Apdex that is different from your general Apdex T threshold. Changing a key transaction's Apdex changes the likelihood that it creates a transaction trace. For example: If you want to make it more likely a key transaction would generate transaction traces, lower its Apdex T value. If you want to make a key transaction less likely to be traced, raise its Apdex T value. Important If you have the transaction trace threshold set to a number of seconds, and not to the default Apdex setting, the number-of-seconds threshold will act as the threshold for all transactions, even for key transactions that have custom Apdex settings.

DistributedTraceSummary MobileRequest MobileRequestError Span Transaction TransactionError InfrastructureEvent Data sources : InfrastructureCloudTrail InfrastructureEvent describes changes (deltas) that occur in a system's live state. When an inventory or system state is added, removed, or changed, Infrastructure will produce an InfrastructureEvent that logs that activity. Attribute name Definition Data types category A New Relic category used to organize events in the UI. For example: automation, notification, and service. InfrastructureEvent changeType A simple classification of the type of change made to the entity: added, modified, or removed. InfrastructureEvent changedPath The fully specified name of the item that changed. This is constructed by taking the source and adding one or more additional path elements that uniquely identify the item that changed. InfrastructureEvent deltaId Delta refers to a recorded change in the system. The deltaId is a number used by New Relic to organize incoming inventory change data. InfrastructureEvent eventId The unique ID of the event, generated by New Relic. InfrastructureEvent format The type of infrastructure event. Each format type includes attributes that may be used to render the event in the UI. InfrastructureEvent newStatus The new agent status: disconnected or connected. InfrastructureEvent newValue If a change is made to the entity, this attribute contains the new value of the inventory that was changed. This will have no value if no change has been made. The value will display approximately 4K bytes of data. InfrastructureEvent oldValue If a change is made to the entity, this attribute contains the old value of the inventory that was changed. This will be blank if no change has been made. InfrastructureEvent provider For integrations that use generic event types (like the DatastoreSample event), the provider value specifies the source of the data (the service, or a sub-category of data from that service). Some Insights events are generic and are used by several integrations. For example, the DatastoreSample event is used by several integrations, including the AWS DynamoDB integration and the AWS RDS integration. In these cases, the provider attribute value represents the source of that attribute. This will usually be the service that data comes from or, for integrations that use several provider values, a certain sub-category of data from that service. When a provider value is present for a generic event, that event will have additional integration-specific attributes attached to it. Here’s an example of an Insights NRQL query that returns the attributes present for a DatastoreSample event reported by the AWS RDS integration: SELECT * from DatastoreSample where provider = 'RdsDbCluster' InfrastructureEvent source The fully specified origin of this inventory item. This is typically in the form category/plugin, where plugin is the generic word used for the tool that gathered this data. InfrastructureEvent summary A summary of the change that happened. Uses a human-friendly string, such as Agent disconnected. InfrastructureEvent violationUpdateType The type of change to the violation: For example: open or closed.

      "body": "Application performance monitoring (APM) is exactly what it sounds like: monitoring of your web or non-web application's performance. APM supports apps for several programming languages, including Go, Java, .NET, Node.js, PHP, Python, and Ruby, as well as a C SDK. View the status of all your services at a glance with APM. Tip This doc gives you detailed information about why APM matters to your business. But if you want to skip ahead, just sign up for a New Relic account. (It's free, forever!) Then, after you install the agent, you can start working with your data. Ready to get started? Start benefiting from APM in five simple steps (and just a few minutes!). Sign up for a New Relic account (it's free, forever!). Install and customize the language agent for your app. Generate some traffic for your app. Wait a few minutes for New Relic to start receiving your data. Log in to your account, and start exploring New Relic! Use the Explorer in New Relic One to access and observe the full stack of your software, including your apps, see performance data and alerting status at a glance, and check relationships. We provide you with a simple, yet powerful visual tool to monitor all your entities, that is, anything we can identify that reports data. In the New Relic ecosystem, entities include basic components like applications, hosts, containers, or database services, but it can also refer to custom groupings of such elements. You can also create your own entities. If data does not appear after waiting a few minutes, follow the troubleshooting tips for your APM agent. Identify problems before your users do Our APM agents report and store the state of your application so you can quickly identify potential problems before they affect your end users. With APM, your DevOps teams don't need to guess whether a performance blocker comes from the app itself, CPU availability, database loads, or something entirely unexpected. Use our APM solutions to gather both current and historical information about memory usage, CPU utilization, database query performance, web browser rendering performance, app availability, error analysis, external services, and other useful metrics. Monitor all aspects of your business Take advantage of these APM features, and more: Features Description App performance at a glance When you sign in to APM and select an app for your account, use the Summary page to quickly examine relationships across different aspects of your environment; for example: Web transactions response time: Where is the most time being spent? In the request queue, during different stages of page rendering and execution, from external services, or something else? Transaction traces: Which transactions are the slowest, and why? Error rate and throughput: What relationship is there between a spike in errors or slower throughput for a particular time period? Was there a deployment or outage at that time? Hosts: What kind of impact does this have on CPU usage, memory, etc.? Apdex: How are these events affecting customers' satisfaction with the site? Web and non-web transactions Start by comparing the top twenty web transactions or non-web transactions in terms of most time consuming, slowest average response time, highest throughput, or worst Apdex. From there, drill down into deeper trace levels for individual transactions, which in turn break down into smaller segments and components, from HTTPS requests on down to SQL queries. Want to explore even deeper? Set up distributed tracing to see how requests move across a distributed system. Select the transactions that are most important to your business (key transactions). APM and Infrastructure When your APM and Infrastructure accounts are linked, you will have access to APM data charts on these Infrastructure UI pages: Hosts, Network, Storage, and Processes. Distributed tracing Distributed tracing gives you visibility across distributed systems, showing you the path of a request as it travels between services. This feature is especially valuable for large, distributed systems that rely on many small services and microservices. Logs Bring your logs and application's data together to make troubleshooting easier and faster. With logs in context, you can see log messages related to your errors and traces directly in your app's UI. You can also see logs in context of your infrastructure data, such as Kubernetes clusters. No need to switch to another UI page in New Relic One. Service maps APM's service maps show your app's connections and dependencies, including databases and external services. Health indicators and performance metrics show you the current operational status for every part of your architecture. You can create and customize service maps to visualize and monitor your complex architectures. Query your data You can query and visualize your data: Sample and search APM transaction and error data to gain full understanding of the data being collected. Browse your data visually with the data explorer. Create custom SQL-like queries of your data using the New Relic Query Language (NRQL), or using our PromQL-style queries. Use dashboards to build advanced data visualizations, contextualize data, and understand what's going on in your system, real-time. These are just a few of APM's features.

      "body": "New Relic for Go monitors your Go language applications and microservices to help you identify and solve performance issues. You can also use your data to improve your customers' experience and make data-driven business decisions. Go is a compiled language, and doesn’t use a virtual machine. The best way to monitor Go applications is to use the Go API. Our API provides exceptional flexibility and control over what gets instrumented. Get New Relic for Go in a few simple steps. Monitor application and microservice performance The Go programming language, also called Golang, has become a popular coding choice for its ease of use, concurrency, and impressive speed. With New Relic for Go, you will gain a new level of visibility into your Golang applications: See the big picture: Monitor the throughput, response times, and errors of the transactions in your applications and services. Understand your application's runtime health by seeing memory usage, garbage collection behavior, and CPU usage over time. With deployment markers, see how code changes impact application performance and health. Use infrastructure monitoring to view detailed host and server data. Use distributed tracing to understand how your services and microservices are interacting. Identify and fix errors: Find bottlenecks by seeing time spent on database calls, external system calls, and key blocks of code. View Goroutine counts and identify possible Goroutine leaks. Get alerts for problems or errors before they affect users. Create custom dashboards for important metrics. View logs for your APM and infrastructure data: You can bring your logs and application's data together to make troubleshooting easier and faster. No need to switch to another UI page in New Relic One. With logs in context, you can see log messages related to your errors and traces directly in your app's UI. You can also see logs in context of your infrastructure data, such as Kubernetes clusters. Analyze business data: Query user-related data and improve business processes. Create custom queries of your Go application data. Send your own custom data to New Relic. Create and share visual, interactive displays of your data. Get New Relic for Go To use New Relic for Go: Check the compatibility and requirements. If you do not already have one, sign up for a free New Relic account. To install the agent, use our launcher, or follow the New Relic Go agent's installation and instrumentation procedures. Wait a few minutes to view data from your Go app in your New Relic account's UI. Read the install docs Add Go data We recommend instrumenting your Go code to get the maximum benefits from the New Relic Go agent. But we make it easy to get great data in couple of ways: Simply import the agent and create an application to get useful runtime information about your number of goroutines, garbage collection statistics, and memory and CPU usage. Use our many integration packages for out-of-the box support for many popular Go web frameworks and libraries. We continue to add integration packages based on your feedback. You can weigh in on potential integrations on the Explorers Hub and our New Relic Go agent GitHub project. Additional instrumentation After installing the agent, consider the Go Telemetry SDK Check the source code The Go agent is open source software. That means you can browse its source code and send improvements, or create your own fork and build it. For more information, see the README.",

      "body": "Browser monitoring's JavaScript snippet introduces a nearly invisible impact on website performance and user perception of the time it takes a page to load. The JavaScript is included in a packet of webpage data that is sent anyway. In addition, it immediately begins monitoring for errors and events as the rest of the webpage executes. The negligible amount of overhead required to load the JavaScript results in a significant return of actionable data. Overall impact The JavaScript's overhead takes into consideration both the impact on the user and the impact on your systems' performance: User perception: Typically users cannot detect performance degradations on a website of less than 200ms. Browser's JavaScript adds less than 15ms in aggregated time per page load. This is split up over time, so at no point would a user be able to perceive any performance impact due to the JavaScript. Webserver and systems: Browser app monitoring occurs on the user's browser, not on the server. Processing time does not have an impact on your CPU consumption. In addition, we take additional steps to minimize any potential impact on the apps and webpages being monitored. For example, the \"loader\" script is loaded synchronously in the <HEAD> in order to ensure monitoring is enabled for the entire life cycle of the page. This script is included inline, which eliminates the need for another roundtrip network request to a content delivery network (CDN). The \"loader\" comes with the initial page load. Later in the life cycle of the page, New Relic loads an additional monitoring script asynchronously. This script should not have any perceivable effect to the user and is included in the overall overhead of less than 15ms per page. Network impact Browser monitoring also minimizes network traffic for the end user by aggregating data locally (in the client) and sending it back to New Relic on load, at periodic intervals, on unload, or when data has been collected. (During the browser session's idle periods, transmissions may not be required.) Browser agent scripts The agent consists of two scripts. The first script is inserted inline into the HTML document. The second script is downloaded from the content delivery network (js-agent.newrelic.com) when the window load event happens. Find out about browser agent types here. Script Lite Pro Pro + SPA Inline script size 8.3 KB 22 KB 27 KB Downloaded script size 27 KB 27 KB 38 KB Browser agent harvests Data type Lite Pro Pro + SPA Harvest frequency Page view metrics/events yes yes yes One call. Once the second script is downloaded, we immediately make the first harvest call, which generates page view metrics and the PageView event. This is a JSONP call to bam.nr-data.net or bam-cell.nr-data.net. PageViewTiming events yes yes yes All agent types collect PageViewTiming events. The first harvest happens 10 seconds after the agent initializes, after window load event. After that, we send additional PageViewTiming events every 30 seconds, but only if there's data to send. For information about the event types included in these harvest calls, see the PageViewTiming section of our data dictionary. JavaScriptError metrics/events no yes yes First call when agent initializes; every 60 seconds after that. These calls, sent as metrics data, happen every 60 seconds because we include the Ajax calls that the agent itself makes. This information also applies to Ajax metrics. Ajax metrics no yes yes Sent together with JavaScript errors. Ajax events no yes yes Sent together with BrowserInteraction events. These are collected immediately when an interaction finishes. We only collect interactions for the initial page load and for route changes. We also have an API for generating custom interactions. There will be a separate call for each interaction. Typically, these calls are infrequent because they depend on the user interacting with the page. This information also applies to BrowserInteraction events. Session traces no yes yes First call when agent initializes; after that, every 10 seconds if there is data to send. Session traces send the most data, but they are heavily sampled. Only about 75 page views per hour get enabled to send session trace data. The agent sends data every 10 seconds if it has enough data to send. PageAction events no yes yes First call is made when agent initializes; after that, every 30 seconds if there is data to send. BrowserInteraction events no no yes Sent immediately when an interaction finishes. There will always be at least one interaction that represents the initial page load. Additional interactions are collected only if the URL changes (representing route change). Harvest frequency details for Ajax events apply here as well.",

      "body": "Your end-user experience depends on your entire technology stack. You need to quickly understand what's causing a customer complaint or issue. Did the problem come from your infrastructure, your application, or the browsers that ultimately render it? Is it the result of a problematic internet provider, a problem in your own data center with failing CPU or memory, or something else? Tip This doc gives you detailed information about why our browser monitoring solution matters to your business. But if you want to skip ahead, just sign up for a New Relic account. (It's free, forever!) Then, after you install the browser monitoring agent, you can start working with your data. More than Real User Monitoring (RUM) Many websites contain dynamic content that is loaded after the initial page has finished loading, and complex JavaScript code increases the need for error reporting. Browser monitoring in New Relic One provides a Real User Monitoring (RUM) solution that measures the speed and performance of your end users as they navigate to your site from different web browsers, devices, operating systems, and networks. With browser monitoring in New Relic One, you see actionable data about your end users' experience with your app. But browser monitoring in New Relic goes far beyond the initial page load to measure full page life cycle data. For example, our browser UI shows you: Actual performance data, such as by page view popularity and user satisfaction (Apdex) scores Perceived performance data that measures how quickly your async or dynamic visuals and interactive page contents display JavaScript error analytics, stack traces, and line-of-code visibility, to show you the end-user steps leading up to an error itself Session performance with a detailed timeline and heat map of the load and interaction events during a webpage's full life cycle AJAX requests indicating problems with timing, end points, and specific locations in the webpage Hash-based route changes in apps with single-page application (SPA) architectures These tools (and more!) help your teams optimize your end users' page load experience, eliminate bugs, and troubleshoot faster across your full stack. Examine user perceptions Real user data gives insights into actual page performance, but you also need to look into your users' perception of your site's performance. Pages can load content in many different ways, and users control when they interact with that content. This is why some user-centric performance metrics happen outside the standard window onload (page load time) in the browser monitoring agent. The PageViewTiming event provides a more real-time delivery mechanism that does not have a dependency on any other event. Additional metrics include: First paint, first contentful paint, and largest contentful paint First input delay First interaction This helps you understand how users experience your site, both from visual and responsiveness standpoints. Improve interactive app performance Our single-page app (SPA) monitoring automatically tracks route changes, initial page loads, and synchronous and asynchronous activity during browser interactions. You can also use our browser agent and SPA API to monitor virtually anything that executes inside the browser. If you are a developer, SPA monitoring can help you: Create faster, more responsive, highly interactive apps. Monitor the throughput and performance that real users are experiencing. Troubleshoot and resolve problems within the context of the page load. Query and visualize the data to assist with business decisions. Bring better apps to the marketplace more quickly. Correlate front-end and back-end problems With New Relic One, you can instrument any type of data you need, such as metrics, events, logs, and traces. This helps you find actionable data about your end users' experience across the stack. For example: Type of data Comments Locations or domains Limit browser monitoring to focus on specific geographical locations or specific types of end-user activity. You can also monitor or block specific domains. Trends in interactions Use our comparative charting feature for a direct page load time comparison between real user (browser) interactions and trends appearing in Synthetic monitors. Distributed tracing Isolate latency from the web browser through back-end services with distributed tracing. The UI helps you see the connection across across a full transaction, from browser activity, to time spent in network, to back-end activity. Browser types Explore your end users' experience with your app segmented by any types of browsers they use, including: Top browsers by throughput Average page load time by platform type (mobile, desktop, and other) Selected browser type by version (for example, Chrome 31, 32, 33, etc.) This helps you quickly determine whether problems with page load timing may be related to a specific browser type or platform, or whether the problem is more widespread. Get started with browser monitoring Follow these basic steps, and you'll quickly be up and running in New Relic with browser monitoring! Review the compatibility details and basic requirements for browser monitoring. Install the browser agent. Go to [one.newrelic.com > Explorer > Browser applications. Use the Explorer to access all your entities, that is, anything we can identify that reports data, from applications and hosts to custom groupings of any elements. View summary data from your Browser summary page, then drill down into page load timing details and other UI data. Configure your alerts for key performance data, or use our Applied Intelligence solutions to reduce alert noise, correlate incidents, and automatically detect anomalies. Query and visualize your default data (or customize your own), then analyze what that data says about your business. Customize and share your own charts and dashboards.",

      "body": "Browser monitoring provides insights into how your application or site behaves when it is loaded in a web browser. Browser only records performance data, as explained in this document. It does not record any data used or stored by the monitored application unless you explicitly configure it to do so. For more information about New Relic's security measures, see our security and privacy documentation, or visit the New Relic security website. Reported data Browser reports many different types of data to help you analyze your website's performance. It only reports page view data, unless you have subscribed to Pro features. You can also enable functionality for AJAX requests, JavaScript errors, and session traces. For most data types, browser transmits the data securely using HTTPS encryption. The browser agent transmits data to New Relic's collectors by using either of the domains bam.nr-data.net or bam-cell.nr-data.net. Here is a summary of the types of data reported by browser monitoring. Page view data This data is reported once per page view and consists of: Page load timing data Name of the server-side app controller that served the page, if available (obfuscated in the page and during transmission) Additional custom parameters set by the server-side app controller, if available (obfuscated in the page and during transmission) Additional custom parameters set by the browser agent API, if set prior to page load This information appears on the Page views page. For data security reasons, browser does not record or collect URL query strings. Server-side data can only be collected when the host is also instrumented by New Relic and the browser monitoring instrumentation is injected by the agent. For more information about how we collect and present this data, see Instrumentation for page load timing. AJAX timing data When enabled, browser periodically reports AJAX timing data until the user navigates away from or closes the page. (New Relic automatically filters out all AJAX requests that take longer than two minutes.) Data includes: Hostnames, ports, and paths (but not search/query parameters) of AJAX request URLs HTTP status code of responses Byte size of request message bodies Name of the server-side app controller servicing the AJAX request and server-side timing data (obfuscated in the page and during transmission), when the browser instrumentation is injected by the New Relic agent Timing data for the AJAX transaction Timing data for the AJAX callbacks This information appears on the AJAX page. JavaScript error data When enabled, browser periodically reports data about every error that occurs on the page until the user navigates away from or closes the page. This information appears on the JavaScript errors page. For each error, the data includes: Exception class of the error Error message containing arbitrary text Stack trace of the error, which may contain function names and URLs of scripts causing the error Error messages typically do not contain any confidential or sensitive information. However, it is possible for messages to be purposefully constructed with sensitive information. Before enabling JavaScript error reporting, ensure that your website does not expose any sensitive information in error messages. Session trace data When enabled, browser periodically reports data on the details of the a single page's life cycle, including user interactions, AJAX loads, and JavaScript errors, until the user navigates away from or closes the page. New Relic automatically stops recording further data after ten minutes. Data includes: Asset load timing details User interactions such as scrolling, mousing, and clicking JavaScript error timing and other JavaScript error information Triggered Javascript events Session traces are captured randomly at a fixed rate from among the monitored page views. Session trace information appears on the Session traces page. SPA data If you use browser's single-page app (SPA) monitoring, New Relic reports the following data once per page load or route change. Browser data for page views, AJAX timing, JavaScript errors, and session traces Hash fragments associated with SPA route changes Additional custom parameters added from the SPA API When SPA monitoring has been enabled, this information appears on the Page views page. Server-side data can only be collected when the host is also instrumented by New Relic, and the browser monitoring instrumentation is injected by the agent. For more information about how we collect and present this data, see Instrumentation for page load timing. URL query strings The browser agent uses the HTTP referer attribute to track page URLs. URLs can sometimes contain potentially sensitive user-entered query data (for example, a user's name). For data security reasons, browser does not record or collect URL query strings. Visitor's IP address Browser uses the visitor's IP address to enrich data for additional visitor segmentation. Details such as the ASN and geoID are mapped to browser data from the IP address. For data security reasons, browser does not retain the visitor's IP address for reporting. The IP address is obtained in the HTTP header from the request to the New Relic collector. New Relic does not retain the visitor's IP address after the attributes have been mapped. The IP address value is overwritten within 24 hours of data being collected. Browser types Browser determines the browser type from the User-Agent header and the geographical location based on the browser's IP address. New Relic does not retain the IP address, only the country and region associated with the performance data. This information appears on the selected app's Geography page. Also, details about specific browser types appear on the selected app's Browsers page. CDN access Page load timing requires access to the content delivery network (CDN), where New Relic's utility JavaScript file (nr.js) is hosted. The domain name for the file (js-agent.newrelic.com) remains static, but the number in the path (version) may change periodically. A script tag is injected by the New Relic agent (or pasted into the webpage for standalone apps) that references the JavaScript on the CDN, which is then loaded by the browser. The loaded JavaScript collects and reports the metrics dynamically to either of the domains bam.nr-data.net or bam-cell.nr-data.net. Important If your end users are behind a firewall or proxy and do not have access to the CDN or to New Relic's networks (including bam.nr-data.net and bam-cell.nr-data.net), browser monitoring will not work. Cookies Browser monitoring creates cookies in the end user's browser. If the user has cookies disabled, page load timing (sometimes referred to as real user monitoring or RUM) will not be able to track sessions properly. Also, if the user has an older browser that does not support the Navigation Timing Specification API, page load timing will not be able to track response times as accurately. New Relic's cookies generated by browser agents older than version 995 may not contain the secure attribute. This is because page load timing data transmission in versions before version 995 use HTTP when the page is HTTP, but use HTTPS when the page is HTTPS. All browser agent versions above version 995 will always use the secure flag for cookies and transmit over HTTPS. JavaScript and AJAX data may contain more sensitive information, so they are always transmitted over HTTPS. Transmission of these cookies using HTTP or access to them from JavaScript is not a significant security risk, because the cookies are not used to make security decisions or allow access to an account. They are used only to collect performance data, with any identifiable data obfuscated. For customers subject to special guidelines for cookie collection, such as those under the EU GDPR/PECR ICO Guidelines, we now provide the option to disable cookie collection for your application. Please see our browser agent v1169 release notes for more information. Important If your site uses P3P, it must be configured to allow these cookies. JSONP requests Page load timing metrics are reported to New Relic using a Script GET, also known as a JSONP request. The Script GET returns a value that is subsequently stored in a cookie and used to trigger trace capturing.",

      "body": "Browser monitoring supports the uploading of source maps, which are used to un-minify error stack traces on the JS errors page. This document explains how to use the API to publish (upload) source maps to browser. Prepare for using the source map API In order to upload source maps to browser via the API, you'll need this information: A user API key (before November 20, 2020, the Admin API key was required; that will still work if already in place) The New Relic application ID for the deployed app The full JavaScript file URL Optionally, if the JavaScript URL doesn't automatically have release info appended to it, the release name and ID What is the JavaScript URL? Every time the agent captures an error in your code, it's associated with the URL of the JavaScript in which it occurred. This is the src attribute of the script tag in your HTML. This full JavaScript URL is required when sending source maps to browser. You can find the URL for an error's JavaScript file in browser, on the JS errors page. See Browser monitoring source maps for more on finding these errors in the UI. Is a release name and ID required? Many organizations include a version number or hash in the JavaScript URL. This is generally added to \"bust\" caches to ensure your users get the most recent version of your code. This type of URL might look something like: https://example.com/assets/application-59.min.js https://example.com/assets/bundle-d6d031.min.js https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/jquery/3.1.1/jquery.js If your app's URLs automatically have the version info appended to it, the browser agent has everything it needs in order to match errors with your code. You can move ahead to generating source maps. If this doesn't apply to you, and JS URLs do not have version info appended, you’ll have to assist the agent by specifying a release name and ID with the API. Is a repo URL or a build commit hash required? If you're interested in connecting New Relic to your CodeStream organization when this feature is available, your repository URL or build commit hash are required. Otherwise, this is optional. If you're interested in learning more about this, you can read about how CodeStream and New Relic work together to make it easier to identify errors and collaborate on fixing them. Are there limits to source map uploads? There is no limit to the overall number of source maps you can upload. However, the API is rate-limited: You can upload a maximum of 100 source maps per minute You can upload a maximum of 5,000 source maps per day Source map files can be a maximum of 50Mb in size. Push source maps to New Relic Now that you have one or more source maps, you are ready to publish it to browser. You can use any of these methods to send source maps to browser: Use the New Relic npm module with the API via the command line or via a client-side JavaScript build/deploy script like Gulp or Grunt. Use API curl commands. Use the browser UI. Use npm module via command line or client-side script The easiest and recommended way to upload source maps to browser is to use the our new @newrelic/publish-sourcemap npm module. It provides a command line tool and Javascript API to accomplish this task. More documentation is available in the npm repo. Here are some examples of using the npm module via the command line. Important The following examples are for US accounts. For EU accounts, the endpoint is https://sourcemaps.service.eu.newrelic.com. For more information, see Introduction to the EU region data center. npm command line: Publish Here's an example of uploading source maps using the npm module via the command line.

      "body": "Application performance monitoring (APM) is exactly what it sounds like: monitoring of your web or non-web application's performance. APM supports apps for several programming languages, including Go, Java, .NET, Node.js, PHP, Python, and Ruby, as well as a C SDK. View the status of all your services at a glance with APM. Tip This doc gives you detailed information about why APM matters to your business. But if you want to skip ahead, just sign up for a New Relic account. (It's free, forever!) Then, after you install the agent, you can start working with your data. Ready to get started? Start benefiting from APM in five simple steps (and just a few minutes!). Sign up for a New Relic account (it's free, forever!). Install and customize the language agent for your app. Generate some traffic for your app. Wait a few minutes for New Relic to start receiving your data. Log in to your account, and start exploring New Relic! Use the Explorer in New Relic One to access and observe the full stack of your software, including your apps, see performance data and alerting status at a glance, and check relationships. We provide you with a simple, yet powerful visual tool to monitor all your entities, that is, anything we can identify that reports data. In the New Relic ecosystem, entities include basic components like applications, hosts, containers, or database services, but it can also refer to custom groupings of such elements. You can also create your own entities. If data does not appear after waiting a few minutes, follow the troubleshooting tips for your APM agent. Identify problems before your users do Our APM agents report and store the state of your application so you can quickly identify potential problems before they affect your end users. With APM, your DevOps teams don't need to guess whether a performance blocker comes from the app itself, CPU availability, database loads, or something entirely unexpected. Use our APM solutions to gather both current and historical information about memory usage, CPU utilization, database query performance, web browser rendering performance, app availability, error analysis, external services, and other useful metrics. Monitor all aspects of your business Take advantage of these APM features, and more: Features Description App performance at a glance When you sign in to APM and select an app for your account, use the Summary page to quickly examine relationships across different aspects of your environment; for example: Web transactions response time: Where is the most time being spent? In the request queue, during different stages of page rendering and execution, from external services, or something else? Transaction traces: Which transactions are the slowest, and why? Error rate and throughput: What relationship is there between a spike in errors or slower throughput for a particular time period? Was there a deployment or outage at that time? Hosts: What kind of impact does this have on CPU usage, memory, etc.? Apdex: How are these events affecting customers' satisfaction with the site? Web and non-web transactions Start by comparing the top twenty web transactions or non-web transactions in terms of most time consuming, slowest average response time, highest throughput, or worst Apdex. From there, drill down into deeper trace levels for individual transactions, which in turn break down into smaller segments and components, from HTTPS requests on down to SQL queries. Want to explore even deeper? Set up distributed tracing to see how requests move across a distributed system. Select the transactions that are most important to your business (key transactions). APM and Infrastructure When your APM and Infrastructure accounts are linked, you will have access to APM data charts on these Infrastructure UI pages: Hosts, Network, Storage, and Processes. Distributed tracing Distributed tracing gives you visibility across distributed systems, showing you the path of a request as it travels between services. This feature is especially valuable for large, distributed systems that rely on many small services and microservices. Logs Bring your logs and application's data together to make troubleshooting easier and faster. With logs in context, you can see log messages related to your errors and traces directly in your app's UI. You can also see logs in context of your infrastructure data, such as Kubernetes clusters. No need to switch to another UI page in New Relic One. Service maps APM's service maps show your app's connections and dependencies, including databases and external services. Health indicators and performance metrics show you the current operational status for every part of your architecture. You can create and customize service maps to visualize and monitor your complex architectures. Query your data You can query and visualize your data: Sample and search APM transaction and error data to gain full understanding of the data being collected. Browse your data visually with the data explorer. Create custom SQL-like queries of your data using the New Relic Query Language (NRQL), or using our PromQL-style queries. Use dashboards to build advanced data visualizations, contextualize data, and understand what's going on in your system, real-time. These are just a few of APM's features.

You can also query and create dashboards of JS error data in the query builder, or use the browser API to monitor handled errors. View JavaScript errors To examine JavaScript errors: Go to one.newrelic.com > Browser > (select an app) > JS errors. Use the available options in the UI to examine what may be causing the errors. Optional: Review event logs or stack traces in the UI. Optional: Query and create dashboards for JS error data with the query builder, or use the API to monitor or log errors. Available options in the UI include: If you want to... Do this Search through long error lists Use the Search box so you can more quickly find and fix errors by keywords, URLs, etc. Group and filter attributes To change how your error data is grouped, use the Group by function. (The Page loads chart cannot be changed with grouping.) To filter the data by only showing errors with specific attributes, use the Filter dropdown. See notable anomalies and patterns The Error profiles table shows notable statistical variations, such as browser versions or devices that have errors occurring more frequently than normal. Examine error details Select an error from the main page to view detailed information about that error, such as the top five browsers that error occurred on, the top five devices it occurred on, and associated URIs. Select Error instances to see event logs and stack traces, if available. Examine events leading up to error The Event log shows the browser interactions, AJAX calls, and traces that led up to an error. Decode your minified JavaScript If your JavaScript is minified, the errors on the JS errors page may not be very useful. To decode minified JavaScript and make these error stack traces more useful, you can upload JavaScript source maps to New Relic. one.newrelic.com > Browser > (select an app) > JS errors: Use this page to group and filter errors, explore stack trace details, and examine trends. Query and visualize JS data New Relic saves JS errors as event data. This allows you to query your error data in the query builder. To run NRQL queries and create dashboards to view or share, query the JavaScriptError event type in the query builder. Use API to monitor handled errors To notice or log your app's handled errors or other miscellaneous errors, use the browser API's noticeError call. Review event logs Important SPA monitoring must be enabled. The event log shows the browser interactions, AJAX calls, and traces that led up to a JS error. This can help you troubleshoot the root cause of errors. one.newrelic.com > Browser > (select an app) > JS errors > (select an error) > Error instances: With SPA monitoring enabled, the event log shows you the activity leading up to an error. To view the Event log (if available): Go to one.newrelic.com > Browser > (select an app) > JS errors > (select an error) > Error instances. The event log will not be visible if there are no events in the event log. For example, if a JS error is occurring after an AJAX request that provides an error message, it could be that your AJAX request doesn't contain the right information. This results in a JS error due to a failed AJAX call. Troubleshoot missing event logs Some reasons for events in the event log not being present: Agent version. To capture event log data your site must have SPA monitoring enabled (browser agent version 1071 or higher). JS error not part of a browser interaction. If the JS error occurs outside of an interaction, the related browser interaction details cannot be captured (for example: if an async JS file experiences an error). A click triggered the JS error. In some cases if the error is a direct result of a click, no associated interactions are captured. Without event logs or stack traces, you can use the error detail charts to analyze the impact the error has by browser type, device type, and URI. View stack traces Stack traces can show you if an error is breaking important functionality, or if it's a less important error. To view an error's stack trace (if available): go to one.newrelic.com > Browser > (select an app) > JS errors > (select an error) > Error instances. Troubleshoot missing stack traces Some reasons why you may not see a stack trace for an error: If errors are not thrown, they will not produce a stack trace. The JS script is hosted on a CDN or another external location, and New Relic can't see the errors originating from those scripts. This can be solved in some cases by using cross-origin resource sharing (CORS). It is an AngularJS error. For more on this, see Missing Angular errors. The error is a SyntaxError or Script error: These occur while the script is loading, so they do not produce a stack trace. Some older browsers may generate errors without a stack trace, or may provide a stack trace that is not usable. You've captured the error before the New Relic agent sees it. If the error occurs during multiple harvest cycles in the same user visit, only error events reported during the first harvest cycle will have a stack trace recorded. Some solutions for reporting stack traces: Use the noticeError API call. Enable development mode. Use the JS errors UI page to get more information, including the event log. The JS errors page is designed to give you actionable information even without a stack trace. Global and generic errors New Relic wraps JavaScript functions to get information about thrown errors via the stack trace. If errors aren't thrown, they won't be available. For example, if you have an AngularJS application, follow the troubleshooting procedures when AngularJS errors do not appear in the UI. For some older browsers, the following errors may be unavailable: SyntaxError or Script error: These occur while the script is loading, so they do not produce a stack trace. In-line JavaScript or event handler errors: These are unwrapped. Errors thrown from third-party scripts that reside on another domain are not available. Errors occurring on older browsers: These may not be able to provide a usable stack trace. In some cases, they may not provide a stack trace at all. Error collection is done by wrapping JavaScript functions, so errors thrown by the browser at a lower level (such as cross-origin resource sharing errors) also are not available.",

      "body": "You can configure the New Relic Ruby agent with settings in a configuration file, environment variables, or programmatically with server-side configuration. This document summarizes the configuration options available for the Ruby agent. If the default value for a configuration option is (Dynamic), this means the Ruby agent calculates the default at runtime. The value for the config setting defaults to the value of another setting as appropriate. Configuration methods and precedence The primary (default) method to configure the Ruby agent is via the configuration file (newrelic.yml) in the config subdirectory. To set configuration values using environment variables: Add the prefix NEW_RELIC_ to the setting's name. Replace any periods . with underscores _. You can also configure a few values in the UI via server-side configuration. The Ruby agent follows this order of precedence for configuration: Environment variables Server-side configuration Configuration file (newrelic.yml) Default configuration settings In other words, environment variables override all other configuration settings and info, server-side configuration overrides the configuration file and default config settings, and so on. View and edit config file options The Ruby agent's newrelic.yml is a standard YAML configuration file. It typically includes a Defaults section at the top, plus sections below for each application environment; for example, Development, Testing, and Production. The Ruby agent determines which section of the newrelic.yml config file to read from by looking at certain environment variables to derive the application's environment. This can be useful, for example, when you want to use info for the log_level config setting in your production environment, and you want more verbose log_level config settings (such as debug in your development environment. Here is an example newrelic.yml config file: common: &default_settings license_key: 'YOUR_LICENSE_KEY' app_name: 'My Application Name' production: <<: *default_settings log_level: info development: <<: *default_settings log_level: debug Copy For non-Rails apps, the Ruby agent looks for the following environment variables, in this order, to determine the application environment: NEW_RELIC_ENV RUBY_ENV RAILS_ENV APP_ENV RACK_ENV If the Ruby agent does not detect values for any of those environment variables, it will default the application environment to development and read from the development section of the newrelic.yml config file. When running the Ruby agent in a Rails app, the agent first looks for the NEW_RELIC_ENV environment variable to determine the application environment and which section of the newrelic.yml to use. If NEW_RELIC_ENV is not present, the agent uses the Rails environment (RAILS_ENV or RAILS.env, depending on the version of Rails) . When you edit the config file, be sure to: Indent only with two spaces. Indent only where relevant, in stanzas such as error_collector. If you do not indent correctly, the agent may throw an Unable to parse configuration file error on startup. To view the most current list of available Ruby agent configuration options, use the rake newrelic:config:docs command. This document describes the most common options. Update the config file This documentation applies to the Ruby agent's latest release. For details on earlier versions, refer to the comments in newrelic.yml itself. To update newrelic.yml file after a new release, use the template in the base directory of the agent gem. When you update to new gem versions, examine or diff config/newrelic.yml and newrelic.yml in the installation directory to take advantage of new configuration options. Important Updating the gem does not automatically update config/newrelic.yml. General These settings are available for agent configuration. Some settings depend on your New Relic subscription level. license_key Type String Default \"\" Environ variable NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY Your New Relic license key. agent_enabled Type Boolean Default (Dynamic) Environ variable NEW_RELIC_AGENT_ENABLED If true, allows the Ruby agent to run. app_name Type String Default (Dynamic) Environ variable NEW_RELIC_APP_NAME Specify the application name used to aggregate data in the New Relic UI. To report data to multiple apps at the same time, specify a list of names separated by a semicolon ;. For example, MyApp or MyStagingApp;Instance1. monitor_mode Type Boolean Default (Dynamic) Environ variable NEW_RELIC_MONITOR_MODE When true, the agent transmits data about your app to the New Relic collector. log_level Type String Default \"info\" Environ variable NEW_RELIC_LOG_LEVEL Sets the level of detail of log messages. Possible log levels, in increasing verbosity, are: error, warn, info or debug. high_security Type Boolean Default false Environ variable NEW_RELIC_HIGH_SECURITY If true, enables high security mode. Ensure you understand the implications of high security mode before enabling this setting. security_policies_token Type String Default \"\" Environ variable NEW_RELIC_SECURITY_POLICIES_TOKEN Applies Language Agent Security Policy settings. proxy_host Type String Default nil Environ variable NEW_RELIC_PROXY_HOST Defines a host for communicating with the New Relic collector via a proxy server. proxy_port Type Integer Default 8080 Environ variable NEW_RELIC_PROXY_PORT Defines a port for communicating with the New Relic collector via a proxy server. proxy_user Type String Default nil Environ variable NEW_RELIC_PROXY_USER Defines a user for communicating with the New Relic collector via a proxy server. proxy_pass Type String Default nil Environ variable NEW_RELIC_PROXY_PASS Defines a password for communicating with the New Relic collector via a proxy server. capture_params Type Boolean Default false Environ variable NEW_RELIC_CAPTURE_PARAMS When true, the agent captures HTTP request parameters and attaches them to transaction traces, traced errors, and TransactionError events. Caution When using the capture_params setting, the Ruby agent will not attempt to filter secret information. Recommendation: To filter secret information from request parameters, use the attributes.include setting instead. For more information, see the Ruby attribute examples. config_path Type String Default (Dynamic) Environ variable NEW_RELIC_CONFIG_PATH Path to newrelic.yml. If undefined, the agent checks the following directories (in order): config/newrelic.yml, newrelic.yml, $HOME/.newrelic/newrelic.yml and $HOME/newrelic.yml. apdex_t Type Float Default 0.5 Environ variable NEW_RELIC_APDEX_T DEPRECATED For agent versions 3.5.0 or higher, set your Apdex T via the New Relic UI. sync_startup Type Boolean Default false Environ variable NEW_RELIC_SYNC_STARTUP When set to true, forces a synchronous connection to the New Relic collector during application startup. For very short-lived processes, this helps ensure the New Relic agent has time to report. send_data_on_exit Type Boolean Default true Environ variable NEW_RELIC_SEND_DATA_ON_EXIT If true, enables the exit handler that sends data to the New Relic collector before shutting down. timeout Type Integer Default 120 Environ variable NEW_RELIC_TIMEOUT Defines the maximum number of seconds the agent should spend attempting to connect to the collector. force_install_exit_handler Type Boolean Default false Environ variable NEW_RELIC_FORCE_INSTALL_EXIT_HANDLER Forces the exit handler that sends all cached data to collector before shutting down to be installed regardless of detecting scenarios where it generally should not be. Known use-case for this option is where Sinatra is running as an embedded service within another framework and the agent is detecting the Sinatra app and skipping the at_exit handler as a result. Sinatra classically runs the entire application in an at_exit block and would otherwise misbehave if the Agent's at_exit handler was also installed in those circumstances. Note: send_data_on_exit should also be set to true in tandem with this setting. log_file_name Type String Default \"newrelic_agent.log\" Environ variable NEW_RELIC_LOG_FILE_NAME Defines a name for the log file. log_file_path Type String Default \"log/\" Environ variable NEW_RELIC_LOG_FILE_PATH Defines a path to the agent log file, excluding the filename. prepend_active_record_instrumentation Type Boolean Default false Environ variable NEW_RELIC_PREPEND_ACTIVE_RECORD_INSTRUMENTATION If true, uses Module#prepend rather than alias_method for ActiveRecord instrumentation. capture_memcache_keys Type Boolean Default false Environ variable NEW_RELIC_CAPTURE_MEMCACHE_KEYS Enable or disable the capture of memcache keys from transaction traces. message_tracer.segment_parameters.enabled Type Boolean Default true Environ variable NEW_RELIC_MESSAGE_TRACER_SEGMENT_PARAMETERS_ENABLED If true, the agent will collect metadata about messages and attach them as segment parameters. marshaller Type String Default \"json\" Environ variable NEW_RELIC_MARSHALLER Specifies a marshaller for transmitting data to the New Relic collector. Currently json is the only valid value for this setting. backport_fast_active_record_connection_lookup Type Boolean Default false Environ variable NEW_RELIC_BACKPORT_FAST_ACTIVE_RECORD_CONNECTION_LOOKUP Backports the faster ActiveRecord connection lookup introduced in Rails 6, which improves agent performance when instrumenting ActiveRecord. Note that this setting may not be compatible with other gems that patch ActiveRecord. labels Type String Default \"\" Environ variable NEW_RELIC_LABELS A dictionary of label names and values that will be applied to the data sent from this agent. May also be expressed as a semicolon-delimited ; string of colon-separated : pairs. For example, <var>Server</var>:<var>One</var>;<var>Data Center</var>:<var>Primary</var>. ca_bundle_path Type String Default nil Environ variable NEW_RELIC_CA_BUNDLE_PATH Manual override for the path to your local CA bundle. This CA bundle will be used to validate the SSL certificate presented by New Relic's data collection service. datastore_tracer.instance_reporting.enabled Type Boolean Default true Environ variable NEW_RELIC_DATASTORE_TRACER_INSTANCE_REPORTING_ENABLED If false, the agent will not report datastore instance metrics, nor add host or port_path_or_id parameters to transaction or slow SQL traces. datastore_tracer.database_name_reporting.enabled Type Boolean Default true Environ variable NEW_RELIC_DATASTORE_TRACER_DATABASE_NAME_REPORTING_ENABLED If false, the agent will not add database_name parameter to transaction or slow sql traces. clear_transaction_state_after_fork Type Boolean Default false Environ variable NEW_RELIC_CLEAR_TRANSACTION_STATE_AFTER_FORK If true, the agent will clear Tracer::State in Agent.drop_buffered_data. exclude_newrelic_header Type Boolean Default false Environ variable NEW_RELIC_EXCLUDE_NEWRELIC_HEADER Allows newrelic distributed tracing headers to be suppressed on outbound requests. infinite_tracing.trace_observer.host Type String Default \"\" Environ variable NEW_RELIC_INFINITE_TRACING_TRACE_OBSERVER_HOST Configures the hostname for the Trace Observer Host. When configured, enables tail-based sampling by sending all recorded spans to a Trace Observer for further sampling decisions, irrespective of any usual agent sampling decision. infinite_tracing.trace_observer.port Type Integer Default 443 Environ variable NEW_RELIC_INFINITE_TRACING_TRACE_OBSERVER_PORT Configures the TCP/IP port for the Trace Observer Host Transaction Tracer The transaction traces feature collects detailed information from a selection of transactions, including a summary of the calling sequence, a breakdown of time spent, and a list of SQL queries and their query plans (on mysql and postgresql). Available features depend on your New Relic subscription level. transaction_tracer.enabled Type Boolean Default true Environ variable NEW_RELIC_TRANSACTION_TRACER_ENABLED If true, enables collection of transaction traces. transaction_tracer.transaction_threshold Type Float Default (Dynamic) Environ variable NEW_RELIC_TRANSACTION_TRACER_TRANSACTION_THRESHOLD Specify a threshold in seconds. Transactions with a duration longer than this threshold are eligible for transaction traces. Specify a float value or the string apdex_f. transaction_tracer.record_sql Type String Default \"obfuscated\" Environ variable NEW_RELIC_TRANSACTION_TRACER_RECORD_SQL Obfuscation level for SQL queries reported in transaction trace nodes. By default, this is set to obfuscated, which strips out the numeric and string literals. If you do not want the agent to capture query information, set this to none. If you want the agent to capture all query information in its original form, set this to raw. When you enable high security mode, this is automatically set to obfuscated. transaction_tracer.record_redis_arguments Type Boolean Default false Environ variable NEW_RELIC_TRANSACTION_TRACER_RECORD_REDIS_ARGUMENTS If true, the agent records Redis command arguments in transaction traces. transaction_tracer.capture_attributes Type Boolean Default true Environ variable NEW_RELIC_TRANSACTION_TRACER_CAPTURE_ATTRIBUTES DEPRECATED Use transaction_tracer.attributes.enabled instead. transaction_tracer.explain_threshold Type Float Default 0.5 Environ variable NEW_RELIC_TRANSACTION_TRACER_EXPLAIN_THRESHOLD Threshold (in seconds) above which the agent will collect explain plans. Relevant only when explain_enabled is true. transaction_tracer.explain_enabled Type Boolean Default true Environ variable NEW_RELIC_TRANSACTION_TRACER_EXPLAIN_ENABLED If true, enables the collection of explain plans in transaction traces. This setting will also apply to explain plans in slow SQL traces if slow_sql.explain_enabled is not set separately. transaction_tracer.stack_trace_threshold Type Float Default 0.5 Environ variable NEW_RELIC_TRANSACTION_TRACER_STACK_TRACE_THRESHOLD Specify a threshold in seconds. The agent includes stack traces in transaction trace nodes when the stack trace duration exceeds this threshold. transaction_tracer.limit_segments Type Integer Default 4000 Environ variable NEW_RELIC_TRANSACTION_TRACER_LIMIT_SEGMENTS Maximum number of transaction trace nodes to record in a single transaction trace. Error Collector The agent collects and reports all uncaught exceptions by default. These configuration options allow you to customize the error collection. For information on ignored and expected errors, see this page on Error Analytics in APM. To set expected errors via the NewRelic::Agent.notice_error Ruby method, consult the Ruby Agent API. error_collector.enabled Type Boolean Default true Environ variable NEW_RELIC_ERROR_COLLECTOR_ENABLED If true, the agent captures traced errors and error count metrics. error_collector.capture_attributes Type Boolean Default true Environ variable NEW_RELIC_ERROR_COLLECTOR_CAPTURE_ATTRIBUTES DEPRECATED Use error_collector.attributes.enabled instead. error_collector.ignore_errors Type String Default \"ActionController::RoutingError,Sinatra::NotFound\" Environ variable NEW_RELIC_ERROR_COLLECTOR_IGNORE_ERRORS DEPRECATED Use error_collector.ignore_classes instead. Specify a comma-delimited list of error classes that the agent should ignore. Caution Server side configuration takes precedence for this setting over all environment configurations. This differs from all other configuration settings where environment variable take precedence over server side configuration. error_collector.ignore_classes Type Array Default [] Environ variable None A list of error classes that the agent should ignore. Caution This option can't be set via environment variable. error_collector.ignore_messages Type Hash Default {} Environ variable None A map of error classes to a list of messages. When an error of one of the classes specified here occurs, if its error message contains one of the strings corresponding to it here, that error will be ignored. Caution This option can't be set via environment variable. error_collector.ignore_status_codes Type String Default \"\" Environ variable NEW_RELIC_ERROR_COLLECTOR_IGNORE_STATUS_CODES A comma separated list of status codes, possibly including ranges. Errors associated with these status codes, where applicable, will be ignored. error_collector.expected_classes Type Array Default [] Environ variable None A list of error classes that the agent should treat as expected. Caution This option can't be set via environment variable. error_collector.expected_messages Type Hash Default {} Environ variable None A map of error classes to a list of messages. When an error of one of the classes specified here occurs, if its error message contains one of the strings corresponding to it here, that error will be treated as expected. Caution This option can't be set via environment variable. error_collector.expected_status_codes Type String Default \"\" Environ variable NEW_RELIC_ERROR_COLLECTOR_EXPECTED_STATUS_CODES A comma separated list of status codes, possibly including ranges. Errors associated with these status codes, where applicable, will be treated as expected. error_collector.max_backtrace_frames Type Integer Default 50 Environ variable NEW_RELIC_ERROR_COLLECTOR_MAX_BACKTRACE_FRAMES Defines the maximum number of frames in an error backtrace. Backtraces over this amount are truncated at the beginning and end. error_collector.capture_events Type Boolean Default (Dynamic) Environ variable NEW_RELIC_ERROR_COLLECTOR_CAPTURE_EVENTS If true, the agent collects TransactionError events. error_collector.max_event_samples_stored Type Integer Default 100 Environ variable NEW_RELIC_ERROR_COLLECTOR_MAX_EVENT_SAMPLES_STORED Defines the maximum number of TransactionError events sent to Insights per harvest cycle. Browser Monitoring The browser monitoring page load timing feature (sometimes referred to as real user monitoring or RUM) gives you insight into the performance real users are experiencing with your website. This is accomplished by measuring the time it takes for your users' browsers to download and render your web pages by injecting a small amount of JavaScript code into the header and footer of each page. browser_monitoring.auto_instrument Type Boolean Default (Dynamic) Environ variable NEW_RELIC_BROWSER_MONITORING_AUTO_INSTRUMENT If true, enables auto-injection of the JavaScript header for page load timing (sometimes referred to as real user monitoring or RUM). browser_monitoring.capture_attributes Type Boolean Default false Environ variable NEW_RELIC_BROWSER_MONITORING_CAPTURE_ATTRIBUTES DEPRECATED Use browser_monitoring.attributes.enabled instead.

      "body": "Browser uses a JavaScript snippet, also referred to as an \"agent,\" to instrument your app's webpages. The JavaScript collects data for browser monitoring. To install the browser agent, you can choose from a number of deployment options. If you don't have one already, create a New Relic account. It's free, forever. Get an account Enable browser monitoring Browser Pro+SPA is the default agent when you enable browser monitoring. This automatically gives you access to all of our browser monitoring features. For more information about the browser monitoring options, see Browser agent types in this document. To enable browser monitoring: Go to one.newrelic.com, select Browser, and then select Add more data. Follow the instructions in the UI to add browser monitoring to your app. Generate some traffic for your app, then wait a few minutes for data to appear in New Relic. Optional: After installation is complete and you are seeing data, go to the App settings page for additional agent configuration, or to change the browser agent type. It may take several minutes after enabling the browser monitoring agent before your webpage data appear in New Relic. If have problems, follow our troubleshooting tips. Deployment options No matter which option you use to deploy browser monitoring, the end result is the same: the browser monitoring JavaScript snippet (also referred to as the \"agent\") is inserted into your app pages. The method you select depends on your preferences and business needs. Enable an APM-monitored app When enabling browser monitoring, you can use an APM agent to automatically inject the browser monitoring JavaScript snippet for you. This is the easiest way to install the agent for an app that's already being monitored by APM. APM-monitored apps are listed on your APM Applications index. Enable with copy/paste When enabling browser monitoring, you can manually insert the JavaScript snippet into your app's webpages. The copy/paste option gives you control over the exact placement of our JavaScript snippet, which is required to monitor the webpage's performance. This is useful for: Standalone apps, static sites, and cached pages delivered by CDN APM apps that are not as closely coupled to the browser app as with a standard server-side app (for example, when your client-side app talks to a REST API back end) Some tips for using the JavaScript snippet: Placement in your webpage: Copy the code snippet, then paste it inline into your pages as close to the top of the <head> element as possible, but after any position-sensitive <meta> tags (for example, X-UA-Compatible or charset information). For more information on the inline head placement, see JavaScript placement requirements. License key and app ID: Near the bottom of the generated JavaScript is your browser license key and application ID. This is useful with the REST API and API Explorer. Instrument webpages using the APM agent This information applies to apps that are also monitored by APM. Our APM agents can instrument webpages with the required JavaScript for page load timing. If you are using an APM agent's API to manually add the JavaScript snippet to your webpages, insert the instrumentation snippet as close to the top as possible. This allows you to take advantage of detailed information about browser's AJAX calls and JavaScript errors. For more information, see the instructions for your APM agent: C SDK Go Java .NET Node.js PHP Python Ruby Use REST API This information applies to apps that are also monitored by APM. The REST API lets you manage deployment outside the browser monitoring UI. This is useful for large organizations deploying multiple apps. Browser agent types: Lite, Pro, Pro+SPA We have three types of browser agents: Lite, Pro, and Pro+SPA. The agent type has no impact on your billing. Browser agent type Comparison Pro+SPA This is the default installed agent when you enable browser monitoring. What it includes: Gives you access to all of the Browser Pro features and to Single Page App (SPA) monitoring. Provides detailed page timing data and the most up-to-date New Relic features, including distributed tracing, for all types of applications. Pro+SPA is not limited only to single page applications. After install, you can downgrade anytime to the less advanced agents if you don't want or need SPA monitoring. Pro What it includes: Gives you access to the Browser Pro features. What it doesn't include: Lacks the functionality designed for single page app monitoring. Lite What it includes: Gives you information about some basic page load timing and browser user information. What it doesn't include: Lacks the Browser Pro features and SPA features. Details about how agent types relate to pricing: New Relic One pricing: This pricing model has data ingest as a billing factor. If you want to reduce data ingest, you may want to consider downgrading to lesser agent types after install. Original pricing: Your access to browser monitoring features is gated by your subscription plan, not by the agent type. This means there is no reason not to use the default Pro+SPA agent. After initial agent installation is finished, you can go to the App settings page to edit your configuration or to change your subscription.",

      "body": "Browser monitoring's JavaScript snippet introduces a nearly invisible impact on website performance and user perception of the time it takes a page to load. The JavaScript is included in a packet of webpage data that is sent anyway. In addition, it immediately begins monitoring for errors and events as the rest of the webpage executes. The negligible amount of overhead required to load the JavaScript results in a significant return of actionable data. Overall impact The JavaScript's overhead takes into consideration both the impact on the user and the impact on your systems' performance: User perception: Typically users cannot detect performance degradations on a website of less than 200ms. Browser's JavaScript adds less than 15ms in aggregated time per page load. This is split up over time, so at no point would a user be able to perceive any performance impact due to the JavaScript. Webserver and systems: Browser app monitoring occurs on the user's browser, not on the server. Processing time does not have an impact on your CPU consumption. In addition, we take additional steps to minimize any potential impact on the apps and webpages being monitored. For example, the \"loader\" script is loaded synchronously in the <HEAD> in order to ensure monitoring is enabled for the entire life cycle of the page. This script is included inline, which eliminates the need for another roundtrip network request to a content delivery network (CDN). The \"loader\" comes with the initial page load. Later in the life cycle of the page, New Relic loads an additional monitoring script asynchronously. This script should not have any perceivable effect to the user and is included in the overall overhead of less than 15ms per page. Network impact Browser monitoring also minimizes network traffic for the end user by aggregating data locally (in the client) and sending it back to New Relic on load, at periodic intervals, on unload, or when data has been collected. (During the browser session's idle periods, transmissions may not be required.) Browser agent scripts The agent consists of two scripts. The first script is inserted inline into the HTML document. The second script is downloaded from the content delivery network (js-agent.newrelic.com) when the window load event happens. Find out about browser agent types here. Script Lite Pro Pro + SPA Inline script size 8.3 KB 22 KB 27 KB Downloaded script size 27 KB 27 KB 38 KB Browser agent harvests Data type Lite Pro Pro + SPA Harvest frequency Page view metrics/events yes yes yes One call. Once the second script is downloaded, we immediately make the first harvest call, which generates page view metrics and the PageView event. This is a JSONP call to bam.nr-data.net or bam-cell.nr-data.net. PageViewTiming events yes yes yes All agent types collect PageViewTiming events. The first harvest happens 10 seconds after the agent initializes, after window load event. After that, we send additional PageViewTiming events every 30 seconds, but only if there's data to send. For information about the event types included in these harvest calls, see the PageViewTiming section of our data dictionary. JavaScriptError metrics/events no yes yes First call when agent initializes; every 60 seconds after that. These calls, sent as metrics data, happen every 60 seconds because we include the Ajax calls that the agent itself makes. This information also applies to Ajax metrics. Ajax metrics no yes yes Sent together with JavaScript errors. Ajax events no yes yes Sent together with BrowserInteraction events. These are collected immediately when an interaction finishes. We only collect interactions for the initial page load and for route changes. We also have an API for generating custom interactions. There will be a separate call for each interaction. Typically, these calls are infrequent because they depend on the user interacting with the page. This information also applies to BrowserInteraction events. Session traces no yes yes First call when agent initializes; after that, every 10 seconds if there is data to send. Session traces send the most data, but they are heavily sampled. Only about 75 page views per hour get enabled to send session trace data. The agent sends data every 10 seconds if it has enough data to send. PageAction events no yes yes First call is made when agent initializes; after that, every 30 seconds if there is data to send. BrowserInteraction events no no yes Sent immediately when an interaction finishes. There will always be at least one interaction that represents the initial page load. Additional interactions are collected only if the URL changes (representing route change). Harvest frequency details for Ajax events apply here as well.",

      "body": "Your end-user experience depends on your entire technology stack. You need to quickly understand what's causing a customer complaint or issue. Did the problem come from your infrastructure, your application, or the browsers that ultimately render it? Is it the result of a problematic internet provider, a problem in your own data center with failing CPU or memory, or something else? Tip This doc gives you detailed information about why our browser monitoring solution matters to your business. But if you want to skip ahead, just sign up for a New Relic account. (It's free, forever!) Then, after you install the browser monitoring agent, you can start working with your data. More than Real User Monitoring (RUM) Many websites contain dynamic content that is loaded after the initial page has finished loading, and complex JavaScript code increases the need for error reporting. Browser monitoring in New Relic One provides a Real User Monitoring (RUM) solution that measures the speed and performance of your end users as they navigate to your site from different web browsers, devices, operating systems, and networks. With browser monitoring in New Relic One, you see actionable data about your end users' experience with your app. But browser monitoring in New Relic goes far beyond the initial page load to measure full page life cycle data. For example, our browser UI shows you: Actual performance data, such as by page view popularity and user satisfaction (Apdex) scores Perceived performance data that measures how quickly your async or dynamic visuals and interactive page contents display JavaScript error analytics, stack traces, and line-of-code visibility, to show you the end-user steps leading up to an error itself Session performance with a detailed timeline and heat map of the load and interaction events during a webpage's full life cycle AJAX requests indicating problems with timing, end points, and specific locations in the webpage Hash-based route changes in apps with single-page application (SPA) architectures These tools (and more!) help your teams optimize your end users' page load experience, eliminate bugs, and troubleshoot faster across your full stack. Examine user perceptions Real user data gives insights into actual page performance, but you also need to look into your users' perception of your site's performance. Pages can load content in many different ways, and users control when they interact with that content. This is why some user-centric performance metrics happen outside the standard window onload (page load time) in the browser monitoring agent. The PageViewTiming event provides a more real-time delivery mechanism that does not have a dependency on any other event. Additional metrics include: First paint, first contentful paint, and largest contentful paint First input delay First interaction This helps you understand how users experience your site, both from visual and responsiveness standpoints. Improve interactive app performance Our single-page app (SPA) monitoring automatically tracks route changes, initial page loads, and synchronous and asynchronous activity during browser interactions. You can also use our browser agent and SPA API to monitor virtually anything that executes inside the browser. If you are a developer, SPA monitoring can help you: Create faster, more responsive, highly interactive apps. Monitor the throughput and performance that real users are experiencing. Troubleshoot and resolve problems within the context of the page load. Query and visualize the data to assist with business decisions. Bring better apps to the marketplace more quickly. Correlate front-end and back-end problems With New Relic One, you can instrument any type of data you need, such as metrics, events, logs, and traces. This helps you find actionable data about your end users' experience across the stack. For example: Type of data Comments Locations or domains Limit browser monitoring to focus on specific geographical locations or specific types of end-user activity. You can also monitor or block specific domains. Trends in interactions Use our comparative charting feature for a direct page load time comparison between real user (browser) interactions and trends appearing in Synthetic monitors. Distributed tracing Isolate latency from the web browser through back-end services with distributed tracing. The UI helps you see the connection across across a full transaction, from browser activity, to time spent in network, to back-end activity. Browser types Explore your end users' experience with your app segmented by any types of browsers they use, including: Top browsers by throughput Average page load time by platform type (mobile, desktop, and other) Selected browser type by version (for example, Chrome 31, 32, 33, etc.) This helps you quickly determine whether problems with page load timing may be related to a specific browser type or platform, or whether the problem is more widespread. Get started with browser monitoring Follow these basic steps, and you'll quickly be up and running in New Relic with browser monitoring! Review the compatibility details and basic requirements for browser monitoring. Install the browser agent. Go to [one.newrelic.com > Explorer > Browser applications. Use the Explorer to access all your entities, that is, anything we can identify that reports data, from applications and hosts to custom groupings of any elements. View summary data from your Browser summary page, then drill down into page load timing details and other UI data. Configure your alerts for key performance data, or use our Applied Intelligence solutions to reduce alert noise, correlate incidents, and automatically detect anomalies. Query and visualize your default data (or customize your own), then analyze what that data says about your business. Customize and share your own charts and dashboards.",

      "body": "If you’ve been reading our documentation, chances are you’ve already learned a bit about New Relic and the many tools and capabilities we offer. We’re very proud of the utility and design of our dashboards, alerts, and versatile programmability, but none of it would be possible without the computing power needed to make it all run smoothly. Just like a finely calibrated race car, what you see on the outside may be the most exciting features, and these are the parts you interact with to “drive.” But without an engine designed to win, elegant instrument panels, a responsive clutch, and a great paint job won’t get you anywhere. Under the hood of New Relic lies the engine powering it all: the New Relic Database (NRDB). In this resource, we explain how NRDB helps you succeed in your observability goals. Billions of data points per minute New Relic ingests billions of telemetry data points every minute, serving more than 180,000 accounts simultaneously. To run such a high-volume platform, the underlying database and query capabilities need to be fast, flexible, and scalable. They must also be equally effective for organizations of all sizes, supporting a wide spectrum of telemetry needs and business goals. NRDB provides the power, speed, and scalability you need to monitor your performance across your entire landscape quickly and effectively. Scale, purpose, and equal access to resources To meet the challenging demands for speed, efficiency, scalability, and reliability, we built NRDB with three key objectives. Unlimited scalability: Hosted in the cloud, NRDB's distributed architecture has the capacity for virtually unlimited scale. Monitoring and analysis: With this dual purpose in mind, NRDB handles operational monitoring and data analytics equally well. This means that NRDB can ingest massive amounts of data while also giving you real-time alerting, lightning-fast queries, and charting — all without sacrificing speed. Resources when you need them: As a multi-tenant system supporting tens of thousands of customers, NRDB gives you the resources you need when you need them (which single-tenant systems cannot match). The lifecycle of a query NRDB returns results for queries of all sizes astonishingly fast. To do this, we use parallel processing at massive scale. This architectural approach is equally effective for accelerating a single large query and for allowing numerous users to run small queries simultaneously without impacting speed. It works like this: A user enters a query using one of our tools, such as the query builder, or a dashboard or other type of instrumentation sends an automated query. NRDB starts by sending the query to a router, which in turn sends the query components to hundreds or even thousands of query workers. The query workers find the data, and the process is repeated in reverse, with data returning to populate dashboards, create alerts, or answer discrete queries, among other things. This process yields complete query results in a fraction of the time that other methods would require. To further improve efficiency, NRDB also caches recent queries, allowing it to send those results back to users nearly instantaneously. The result: flexibility, speed, accuracy, and efficiency How big is the difference? Because of NDRB's raw power and purposeful design, New Relic's telemetry products are able to analyze tens of billions of events per second while maintaining a median query response time of 45 milliseconds. We would say, “Your query results are just a heartbeat away,” but mathematically that’s more like a tenth of a heartbeat (unless you’re a mouse). What do these statistics mean for our customers? At the end of the day, NRDB's speed and unique capabilities enable you to identify, analyze, and fix performance problems much faster, reducing downtime so you can get back to business. What’s next? Now it's time to get data into New Relic! New Relic-built agents and integrations There are many ways to get data into your New Relic account. Any New Relic user can use any of our data ingest methods to report data to our platform.When you enable New Relic solutions like APM, browser monitoring, mobile monitoring, infrastructure monitoring, or any of our wide array of quickstarts, by default you'll receive data from your monitored applications, hosts, services, or other entities. Some options for getting started: Log into one.newrelic.com and click Add more data to get some guidance on setting up New Relic solutions. (Need to create a New Relic account first? Sign up for free!) To browse our solutions, see New Relic Instant Observability. Report custom data If you need to report data that our agents and integrations don't provide, we have tools that will allow you to bring in any type of data you need. To learn more, see Intro to custom data. Learn more Want to know more? Here are a few recommendations for what to do next: Learn about NRDB's data model and flexible schema in our blog post and white paper.

Resources when you need them: As a multi-tenant system supporting tens of thousands of customers, NRDB gives you the resources you need when you need them (which single-tenant systems cannot match). The lifecycle of a query NRDB returns results for queries of all sizes astonishingly fast. To do this, we use parallel processing at massive scale. This architectural approach is equally effective for accelerating a single large query and for allowing numerous users to run small queries simultaneously without impacting speed. It works like this: A user enters a query using one of our tools, such as the query builder, or a dashboard or other type of instrumentation sends an automated query. NRDB starts by sending the query to a router, which in turn sends the query components to hundreds or even thousands of query workers. The query workers find the data, and the process is repeated in reverse, with data returning to populate dashboards, create alerts, or answer discrete queries, among other things. This process yields complete query results in a fraction of the time that other methods would require. To further improve efficiency, NRDB also caches recent queries, allowing it to send those results back to users nearly instantaneously. The result: flexibility, speed, accuracy, and efficiency How big is the difference? Because of NDRB's raw power and purposeful design, New Relic's telemetry products are able to analyze tens of billions of events per second while maintaining a median query response time of 45 milliseconds. We would say, “Your query results are just a heartbeat away,” but mathematically that’s more like a tenth of a heartbeat (unless you’re a mouse). What do these statistics mean for our customers? At the end of the day, NRDB's speed and unique capabilities enable you to identify, analyze, and fix performance problems much faster, reducing downtime so you can get back to business. What’s next? Now it's time to get data into New Relic! New Relic-built agents and integrations There are many ways to get data into your New Relic account. Any New Relic user can use any of our data ingest methods to report data to our platform.When you enable New Relic solutions like APM, browser monitoring, mobile monitoring, infrastructure monitoring, or any of our wide array of quickstarts, by default you'll receive data from your monitored applications, hosts, services, or other entities. Some options for getting started: Log into one.newrelic.com and click Add more data to get some guidance on setting up New Relic solutions. (Need to create a New Relic account first? Sign up for free!) To browse our solutions, see New Relic Instant Observability. Report custom data If you need to report data that our agents and integrations don't provide, we have tools that will allow you to bring in any type of data you need.

      "body": "Our Python agent monitors your Python application to help you identify and solve performance issues. You can also extend your performance monitoring to collect and analyze business data to help you improve the customer experience and make data-driven business decisions. With flexible options for custom instrumentation and APIs, The Python agent offers multiple building blocks to customize the data you need from your app. Our Python works with a wide variety of web frameworks and hosting mechanisms, including Django, Gunicorn, WSGI, CherryPy, uWSGI, and more. You can also install the Python agent in a Google App Engine flexible environment. Monitor app performance After you install the Python agent, it begins to collect data about your app. You can view the data as charts and tables in New Relic One. View the big picture of your app. Monitor your app's Apdex (user satisfaction). Get a high-level summary of your app with Summary page. Enable distributed tracing to see activity across an architecture having many services. Install Infrastructure monitoring and view detailed server/host data for your app. Find errors and problems quickly. Track key transactions specific to your business. Create custom dashboards for important metrics. Alert your team when an error or problem occurs before it affects your users. View performance after a deployment. Drill down into performance details. Examine code-level transaction traces. Examine database query traces. Examine error traces. Use thread profiler sessions to see detailed stack traces of sampled threads View logs for your APM and infrastructure data Bring your logs and application's data together to make troubleshooting easier and faster. No need to switch to another UI page in New Relic One. With logs in context, you can see log messages related to your errors and traces directly in your app's UI. You can also see logs in context of your infrastructure data, such as Kubernetes clusters. Extend agent instrumentation Other helpful tools include: Tools Description Browser monitoring Integrate the Python agent with browser monitoring to gain visibility into end-user browser activity. Simple scripts and background tasks Monitor job-based or task queuing systems, like Celery, or other standalone non-web functions. Business data analysis with data exploration. Use the Python agent with our data explorer to organize, query, and visualize your data to answer key questions about application performance and customer experience. Use default transaction attributes, or add your own. Query your data using the New Relic Query Language (NRQL). Send your own event data. Create and share customizable, interactive dashboards. Install the Python agent Before you install the Python agent, make sure your system meets the system requirements. You must also create a New Relic account. We support a number of web frameworks and libraries right out of the box, including Django, WSGI, and Gunicorn. If you use one of the supported web frameworks, installation is easy. If you use an unsupported framework, the process will involve some additions to your app code and/or web server files. For a quick and simple install process that will work for the majority of setups, follow these simple steps: Download and install the Python package. Create config file. Integrate the Python agent with your application. Read the Quick Start guide Add Python data Monitor non-web scripts, background tasks, and functions The Python agent also lets you monitor non-web scripts, worker processes, tasks, and functions. The installation process for these non-web transactions is similar to the one used for a web app, with one major difference: instead of going through the standard integration process described in the install instructions, you would manually \"wrap\" any function you want to monitor. For more information, see Non-web tasks and processes. For instructions on monitoring Celery tasks, see Celery background tasks. What's next after installation? Once you get the agent up and running, some suggested next steps are: Explore your data in and get comfortable with the user interface. Read our docs on our other observability solutions and the APM page. Change your application's name, or other configuration options. Learn about setting up custom instrumentation for application activity not monitored by default. Consider the Python Telemetry SDK. Troubleshooting After you complete the install process, your data should appear in the APM UI within five minutes. If it does not, use these troubleshooting resources: If no data appears, follow these troubleshooting steps. If you experience issues when installing or running the Python agent on a new host, test that the package is installed correctly and that it can contact New Relic's data collector service. For other problems, see the full list of troubleshooting documentation. Check the source code The Python agent is open source software. That means you can browse its source code and send improvements, or create your own fork and build it. For more information, see the README.",

      "body": "Problem You are not seeing AJAX data for your browser app. Solution If your application is instrumented with browser monitoring and is correctly collecting data for other Pro features, follow these steps: 1. Verify you use XMLHttpRequest. Check whether your application uses the XMLHttpRequest object to make AJAX calls. Browser monitoring: Other methods (including the newer Fetch API) currently are not supported when using browser Pro. Single-page app monitoring: Fetch is supported for AJAX requests within a browser interaction with SPA monitoring. If you are making requests using JSONP, see JSONP requirements. 2. Verify the object is instrumented. If you are using XMLHttpRequest, use your browser's dev console to verify that the object has been instrumented by New Relic. Enter the object name at your console. If instrumentation has succeeded, the console should return something like: function (t){var e=new p(t);try{u.emit(\"new-xhr\"... Copy If instrumentation failed, you will see something like: function XMLHttpRequest() { [native_code] } Copy If you see this type of failure response, see Troubleshooting browser monitoring installation. If you see a different response, you may be using another script or library that is conflicting with New Relic instrumentation. Contact support at support.newrelic.com. 3. Verify network access. If the object is properly instrumented, try triggering an AJAX call in your application while monitoring network traffic in the browser's developer tools. Wait up to one minute, and look for a call to bam.nr-data.net/jserrors with an xhr parameter. If the call fails, check for network issues. If you don't see this call, if it fails with an error not related to network access, or if it succeeds but you still aren't seeing data, get support at support.newrelic.com. If your requests use JSONP, see requirements and notes on functionality below: JSONP requirements If your requests use JSONP, these requests will not appear on the AJAX UI page. However, you can view them as assets within session traces. If using SPA monitoring, you can view them on the Breakdown tab of the Page views page. Requirements for JSONP to be recognized: Each JSONP request must use a unique callback function. Most popular libraries (like jQuery) generate a unique callback function dynamically for each request. The query string callback must be named \"callback\" or \"cb\" in order to be recognized by New Relic. This is the default behavior in most popular libraries.",

      "body": "Browser monitoring's JavaScript snippet introduces a nearly invisible impact on website performance and user perception of the time it takes a page to load. The JavaScript is included in a packet of webpage data that is sent anyway. In addition, it immediately begins monitoring for errors and events as the rest of the webpage executes. The negligible amount of overhead required to load the JavaScript results in a significant return of actionable data. Overall impact The JavaScript's overhead takes into consideration both the impact on the user and the impact on your systems' performance: User perception: Typically users cannot detect performance degradations on a website of less than 200ms. Browser's JavaScript adds less than 15ms in aggregated time per page load. This is split up over time, so at no point would a user be able to perceive any performance impact due to the JavaScript. Webserver and systems: Browser app monitoring occurs on the user's browser, not on the server. Processing time does not have an impact on your CPU consumption. In addition, we take additional steps to minimize any potential impact on the apps and webpages being monitored. For example, the \"loader\" script is loaded synchronously in the <HEAD> in order to ensure monitoring is enabled for the entire life cycle of the page. This script is included inline, which eliminates the need for another roundtrip network request to a content delivery network (CDN). The \"loader\" comes with the initial page load. Later in the life cycle of the page, New Relic loads an additional monitoring script asynchronously. This script should not have any perceivable effect to the user and is included in the overall overhead of less than 15ms per page. Network impact Browser monitoring also minimizes network traffic for the end user by aggregating data locally (in the client) and sending it back to New Relic on load, at periodic intervals, on unload, or when data has been collected. (During the browser session's idle periods, transmissions may not be required.) Browser agent scripts The agent consists of two scripts. The first script is inserted inline into the HTML document. The second script is downloaded from the content delivery network (js-agent.newrelic.com) when the window load event happens. Find out about browser agent types here. Script Lite Pro Pro + SPA Inline script size 8.3 KB 22 KB 27 KB Downloaded script size 27 KB 27 KB 38 KB Browser agent harvests Data type Lite Pro Pro + SPA Harvest frequency Page view metrics/events yes yes yes One call. Once the second script is downloaded, we immediately make the first harvest call, which generates page view metrics and the PageView event. This is a JSONP call to bam.nr-data.net or bam-cell.nr-data.net. PageViewTiming events yes yes yes All agent types collect PageViewTiming events. The first harvest happens 10 seconds after the agent initializes, after window load event. After that, we send additional PageViewTiming events every 30 seconds, but only if there's data to send. For information about the event types included in these harvest calls, see the PageViewTiming section of our data dictionary. JavaScriptError metrics/events no yes yes First call when agent initializes; every 60 seconds after that. These calls, sent as metrics data, happen every 60 seconds because we include the Ajax calls that the agent itself makes. This information also applies to Ajax metrics. Ajax metrics no yes yes Sent together with JavaScript errors. Ajax events no yes yes Sent together with BrowserInteraction events. These are collected immediately when an interaction finishes. We only collect interactions for the initial page load and for route changes. We also have an API for generating custom interactions. There will be a separate call for each interaction. Typically, these calls are infrequent because they depend on the user interacting with the page. This information also applies to BrowserInteraction events. Session traces no yes yes First call when agent initializes; after that, every 10 seconds if there is data to send. Session traces send the most data, but they are heavily sampled. Only about 75 page views per hour get enabled to send session trace data. The agent sends data every 10 seconds if it has enough data to send. PageAction events no yes yes First call is made when agent initializes; after that, every 30 seconds if there is data to send. BrowserInteraction events no no yes Sent immediately when an interaction finishes. There will always be at least one interaction that represents the initial page load. Additional interactions are collected only if the URL changes (representing route change). Harvest frequency details for Ajax events apply here as well.",

Because we do not restrict the timing, you can receive first paint or first interaction data regardless of when it fires. This document describes why and how to use PageViewTiming and its attributes to query data about your site, component loading, and user performance metrics, both from visual and responsiveness standpoints. Why use PageViewTiming? If your application uses asynchronous or dynamic pages, you may need additional details about site or component loading. But pages can load content in many different ways, and users control when they interact with that content. This is why some user-centric performance metrics happen outside the standard window onload (page load time) in the browser agent. For example, users may become impatient and begin clicking as soon as content is on the webpage. Or, they may wait to use the page until long after content is loaded. The PageViewTiming event provides a more real-time delivery mechanism that does not have a dependency on any other event. The additional metrics can help you understand how users experience your site, both from visual and responsiveness standpoints. Support for Google's Core Web Vitals As of agent version 1177 for browser monitoring, we have full support for Google's Core Web Vitals. It requires a Pro or above Browser agent. Note that the metrics that make up Core Web Vitals evolve over time. The current set focuses on three aspects of the user experience: loading, interactivity, and visual stability. It includes the following metrics and their respective thresholds: Core Web Vitals metrics include loading, interactivity, and visual stability. Largest Contentful Paint (LCP): measures loading performance. To provide a good user experience, LCP should occur within 2.5 seconds of when the page first starts loading. First Input Delay (FID): measures interactivity. To provide a good user experience, pages should have a FID of less than 100 milliseconds. Cumulative Layout Shift (CLS): measures visual stability. To provide a good user experience, pages should maintain a CLS of less than 0.1. For each of these metrics, to ensure you're hitting the recommended target for most of your users, a good threshold to measure is the 75th percentile of page loads, segmented across mobile and desktop devices. To learn more, watch our Nerd Days talk on perceived performance. Detailed visual, interactivity, and responsiveness metrics The BrowserInteraction and PageView events end their reporting when they receive the page window load (or window load and AJAX) timing. However, paint and interactivity metrics can happen at any time. PageViewTiming delivers these metrics as a separate event to: Account for the variability in this timing. Avoid setting an arbitrary timeout. Prevent holding BrowserInteraction and PageView events indefinitely. Additional data Comments firstPaint and firstContentfulPaint The firstPaint and firstContentfulPaint attributes already are available with BrowserInteraction and PageView events. However, they are not always reliably captured before the window onload event fires. Using PageViewTiming gives you a way to capture these metrics even if they happen after the original page load time. This gives you a better understanding of the correlation between responsiveness of that load event and the visual rendering of your content. largestContentfulPaint The largestContentfulPaint,metric is available with agent version 1163 or higher. It reports the render time of the largest content element visible in the viewport. Google's research found that looking at when the largest element was rendered was a more accurate way to measure when the main content of a page is loaded and useful. For more information about this metric, including limitations and considerations, see the w3c draft. We also report the cumulative layout shift (CLS) score attribute with LCP. This attribute is reported as cumulativeLayoutShift. Largest Contentful Paint is one of three metrics identified by Google as the Core Web Vitals. LCP values up to 2.5 secs are considered \"Good,\" between 2.5-4.0 secs are considered \"Needs Improvement,\" and above 4.0 secs are considered \"Poor.\" firstInteraction and firstInputDelay With the addition of firstInteraction and firstInputDelay, you can quickly determine the ways that your users are interacting with that visual content. These metrics tell you not only when they interacted, but what type of interaction (mousedown, pointerdown, etc.) and how long it took for them to receive a response from your site. The firstInputDelay metric lies in the middle of FirstContentfulPaint and Time to Interactive (TTI) metrics. It measures the time between when a first input can be made and when the browser's main thread is able to respond to any interactions. We also report the cumulative layout shift (CLS) score attribute at the moment of the user's first interaction. This attribute is reported as cumulativeLayoutShift. First Input Delay is one of three metrics identified by Google as the Core Web Vitals. FID values up to 100 ms are considered \"Good,\" between 100-300 ms are considered \"Needs Improvement,\" and above 300 ms are considered \"Poor.\" For a more detailed explanation, see our browser monitoring release notes. cumulativeLayoutShift Cumulative Layout Shift (CLS) is available with agent v1177 or higher. CLS is an important, user-centric metric for measuring visual stability because it helps quantify how often users experience unexpected layout shifts. A low CLS helps ensure that the page is delightful. This is one of three metrics identified by Google as the Core Web Vitals. Cumulative Layout Shift is one of three metrics identified by Google as the Core Web Vitals. CLS scores up to 0.1 are considered \"Good,\" between 0.1-0.25 are considered \"Needs Improvement,\" and above 0.25 are considered \"Poor.\" timingName You can review different types of activities with the timingName attribute, such as firstPaint, firstContentfulPaint, firstInteraction, largestContentfulPaint, pageHide and windowUnload. For example, a PageViewTiming event may have a timingName of firstPaint and a firstPaint value of .03. The event will also include all default attributes included with the standard BrowserInteraction and PageView events. elementId This is the Id, if specified, of the largestContentfulPaint element. This value will only be reported with the LCP metric. This value can be null. elementSize This is the reported size of the largestContentfulPaint element. This value will only be reported with the LCP metric. pageHide The pageHide event, available with agent v1177 or higher, is sent when the browser hides the current page in the process of presenting a different page from the session's history. For example, when the user clicks the browser's Back button, the current page receives a pageHide event before the previous page is shown. For supporting documentation and browser compatibility for the pageHide event, see the MDN Web Docs site. We also report the cumulative layout shift (CLS) score attribute with pageHide. This attribute is reported as cumulativeLayoutShift. windowLoad The windowLoad event is available with agent v1177 or higher. This is fired when the whole page has loaded, including all dependent resources such as stylesheets and images. For supporting documentation and browser compatibility for the windowLoad event, see the MDN Web Docs site. We also report the cumulative layout shift (CLS) score attribute with windowLoad. This attribute is reported as cumulativeLayoutShift. windowUnload The windowUnload event is available with agent v1163 or higher. This is fired when a document or child resource is being unloaded. For supporting documentation and browser compatibility for the windowUnload event, see the MDN Web Docs site. We also report the cumulative layout shift (CLS) score attribute with windowUnload. This attribute is reported as cumulativeLayoutShift. Compatibility and requirements Requirements: Meets install requirements. Reporting of this event requires browser agent version 1153 or higher and a Pro or Pro+SPA agent. Follow our Browser agent release notes to find out when new metrics are released. These metrics are supported by the following browser versions. For unsupported browsers, no PageViewTiming events will be recorded. Metrics Supported browser versions cumulativeLayoutShift Chrome 79 Metric is elevated to stable; changes in metric definition will be reported in this log. Chrome 77 Metric exposed via API: Cumulative Layout Shift available via Layout Instability API firstPaint firstContentfulPaint Chrome 60 or higher for desktop and mobile (Android webview and Chrome for Android) Opera 47 or higher for desktop Opera 44 or higher for Android mobile Samsung Internet for mobile largestContentfulPaint Chrome 77 or higher for desktop and mobile firstInteraction firstInputDelay These metrics require the addEventListener browser API. This API is available in all modern browsers, including: Apple Safari Google Chrome Microsoft Internet Explorer (IE) versions 9 or higher Mozilla Firefox pageHide This metric is currently supported by all browsers on desktop and mobile.

Compatibility matrix via MDN documentation. windowUnload This metric is currently supported by all browsers on desktop and mobile. Compatibility matrix via MDN documentation. CumulativeLayoutShift Cumulative Layout Shift (CLS) is a metric measuring the stability of the content on a webpage. For a complete description, see web.dev/cls. How is CLS captured in New Relic Shifts in page layout as reported by the Layout Instability API are aggregated throughout the life of the page and reported as an attribute on all PageViewTiming events, representing the CLS value when that event occurred. Using this model, users can look at their CLS value at different points in the page's life; for example, CLS values up until the first-time users interact with the page or hide the page. Approximating other CLS sources Lighthouse captures CLS value only up to the time when a page is loaded, which is useful in a development or lab environment. You can approximate Lighthouse values by looking at the windowLoad PageViewTiming event. CrUX report uses values captured over the lifespan of the page, which is useful to analyze worst-case shifts in a RUM environment. You can approximate CrUX values by looking at the CLS attribute on the windowUnload PageViewTiming event. These values will not be exactly the same because of different sample sets and a difference in how values from long-lived web pages are included. The New Relic browser monitoring agent captures CLS when the page unloads, while CrUX collects and updates the metric throughout the lifespan of the page. How CLS is aggregated As of July 2021, Google has updated the way CLS values are aggregated. Browser monitoring agent versions v12xx use the method described in Evolving the CLS metric. Browser monitoring agent v12xx or higher: Layout shift values are captured in windows. Layout shifts that occurred within 1 second of each other, but no more than 5 seconds between the first and last shift, are part of the same window. A CLS score represents the sum of layout shift values from the window with the highest sum of layout shift values. Prior to Browser agent v12xx: A CLS score represents the sum of all layout shifts that occurred up until that point in the page's life. Query your event data Here are some sample queries for the event data to help you get started.

If a user navigates from a site without page load timing to a site with page load timing (for example, to the first page on your page load timing-enabled site), special considerations for navigation start time arise. Contents Network estimate The page load timing JavaScript utility file creates a cookie with the navigation start time when a user leaves a page (by hooking an event, beforeunload, or pagehide, depending on the browser). However, when navigating away from a site without page load timing enabled, the JavaScript code will not be present, and the cookie will not be created. Then, when the user hits the first page of a site, the navigation start time cannot be determined, because there is no cookie. In this case the browser agent has all the data (queue time, app time, DOM content and rendering time) except network time. Navigation start time is required to compute network time. Rather than toss the data, the page load timing feature estimates the network time based on recently accumulated averages for your application, regionally. This way the page load timing feature provides a more accurate throughput measurement, and the rest of the data is retained. This is especially important for sites with a high bounce rate (when users visit only one page). The more visitors you have from different regions, the more accurate the network estimate will be. Network estimate unavailable If a network estimate is not available for your application and for the region where the hit originated, the page load timing process reverts to a network estimate across all reporting apps for the region. Failing that, the data is tossed. Note: For browsers that have the Navigation Timing API, this is not an issue, as the navigation start time can be determined without using a cookie.",

Here are some additional tips for cached pages: Java: Flush the app server’s \"work\" cache.

We also report the cumulative layout shift (CLS) score attribute at the moment of the user's first interaction. This attribute is reported as cumulativeLayoutShift. First Input Delay is one of three metrics identified by Google as the Core Web Vitals. FID values up to 100 ms are considered \"Good,\" between 100-300 ms are considered \"Needs Improvement,\" and above 300 ms are considered \"Poor.\" For a more detailed explanation, see our browser monitoring release notes. cumulativeLayoutShift Cumulative Layout Shift (CLS) is available with agent v1177 or higher. CLS is an important, user-centric metric for measuring visual stability because it helps quantify how often users experience unexpected layout shifts. A low CLS helps ensure that the page is delightful. This is one of three metrics identified by Google as the Core Web Vitals. Cumulative Layout Shift is one of three metrics identified by Google as the Core Web Vitals. CLS scores up to 0.1 are considered \"Good,\" between 0.1-0.25 are considered \"Needs Improvement,\" and above 0.25 are considered \"Poor.\" timingName You can review different types of activities with the timingName attribute, such as firstPaint, firstContentfulPaint, firstInteraction, largestContentfulPaint, pageHide and windowUnload. For example, a PageViewTiming event may have a timingName of firstPaint and a firstPaint value of .03. The event will also include all default attributes included with the standard BrowserInteraction and PageView events. elementId This is the Id, if specified, of the largestContentfulPaint element. This value will only be reported with the LCP metric. This value can be null. elementSize This is the reported size of the largestContentfulPaint element. This value will only be reported with the LCP metric. pageHide The pageHide event, available with agent v1177 or higher, is sent when the browser hides the current page in the process of presenting a different page from the session's history. For example, when the user clicks the browser's Back button, the current page receives a pageHide event before the previous page is shown. For supporting documentation and browser compatibility for the pageHide event, see the MDN Web Docs site. We also report the cumulative layout shift (CLS) score attribute with pageHide. This attribute is reported as cumulativeLayoutShift. windowLoad The windowLoad event is available with agent v1177 or higher. This is fired when the whole page has loaded, including all dependent resources such as stylesheets and images. For supporting documentation and browser compatibility for the windowLoad event, see the MDN Web Docs site. We also report the cumulative layout shift (CLS) score attribute with windowLoad. This attribute is reported as cumulativeLayoutShift. windowUnload The windowUnload event is available with agent v1163 or higher. This is fired when a document or child resource is being unloaded. For supporting documentation and browser compatibility for the windowUnload event, see the MDN Web Docs site. We also report the cumulative layout shift (CLS) score attribute with windowUnload. This attribute is reported as cumulativeLayoutShift. Compatibility and requirements Requirements: Meets install requirements. Reporting of this event requires browser agent version 1153 or higher and a Pro or Pro+SPA agent. Follow our Browser agent release notes to find out when new metrics are released. These metrics are supported by the following browser versions. For unsupported browsers, no PageViewTiming events will be recorded. Metrics Supported browser versions cumulativeLayoutShift Chrome 79 Metric is elevated to stable; changes in metric definition will be reported in this log. Chrome 77 Metric exposed via API: Cumulative Layout Shift available via Layout Instability API firstPaint firstContentfulPaint Chrome 60 or higher for desktop and mobile (Android webview and Chrome for Android) Opera 47 or higher for desktop Opera 44 or higher for Android mobile Samsung Internet for mobile largestContentfulPaint Chrome 77 or higher for desktop and mobile firstInteraction firstInputDelay These metrics require the addEventListener browser API. This API is available in all modern browsers, including: Apple Safari Google Chrome Microsoft Internet Explorer (IE) versions 9 or higher Mozilla Firefox pageHide This metric is currently supported by all browsers on desktop and mobile. Compatibility matrix via MDN documentation. windowLoad This metric is currently supported by all browsers on desktop and mobile. Compatibility matrix via MDN documentation. windowUnload This metric is currently supported by all browsers on desktop and mobile. Compatibility matrix via MDN documentation. CumulativeLayoutShift Cumulative Layout Shift (CLS) is a metric measuring the stability of the content on a webpage. For a complete description, see web.dev/cls. How is CLS captured in New Relic Shifts in page layout as reported by the Layout Instability API are aggregated throughout the life of the page and reported as an attribute on all PageViewTiming events, representing the CLS value when that event occurred. Using this model, users can look at their CLS value at different points in the page's life; for example, CLS values up until the first-time users interact with the page or hide the page. Approximating other CLS sources Lighthouse captures CLS value only up to the time when a page is loaded, which is useful in a development or lab environment. You can approximate Lighthouse values by looking at the windowLoad PageViewTiming event. CrUX report uses values captured over the lifespan of the page, which is useful to analyze worst-case shifts in a RUM environment. You can approximate CrUX values by looking at the CLS attribute on the windowUnload PageViewTiming event. These values will not be exactly the same because of different sample sets and a difference in how values from long-lived web pages are included. The New Relic browser monitoring agent captures CLS when the page unloads, while CrUX collects and updates the metric throughout the lifespan of the page. How CLS is aggregated As of July 2021, Google has updated the way CLS values are aggregated. Browser monitoring agent versions v12xx use the method described in Evolving the CLS metric. Browser monitoring agent v12xx or higher: Layout shift values are captured in windows. Layout shifts that occurred within 1 second of each other, but no more than 5 seconds between the first and last shift, are part of the same window. A CLS score represents the sum of layout shift values from the window with the highest sum of layout shift values. Prior to Browser agent v12xx: A CLS score represents the sum of all layout shifts that occurred up until that point in the page's life. Query your event data Here are some sample queries for the event data to help you get started.

If a user navigates from a site without page load timing to a site with page load timing (for example, to the first page on your page load timing-enabled site), special considerations for navigation start time arise. Contents Network estimate The page load timing JavaScript utility file creates a cookie with the navigation start time when a user leaves a page (by hooking an event, beforeunload, or pagehide, depending on the browser). However, when navigating away from a site without page load timing enabled, the JavaScript code will not be present, and the cookie will not be created. Then, when the user hits the first page of a site, the navigation start time cannot be determined, because there is no cookie. In this case the browser agent has all the data (queue time, app time, DOM content and rendering time) except network time. Navigation start time is required to compute network time. Rather than toss the data, the page load timing feature estimates the network time based on recently accumulated averages for your application, regionally. This way the page load timing feature provides a more accurate throughput measurement, and the rest of the data is retained. This is especially important for sites with a high bounce rate (when users visit only one page). The more visitors you have from different regions, the more accurate the network estimate will be. Network estimate unavailable If a network estimate is not available for your application and for the region where the hit originated, the page load timing process reverts to a network estimate across all reporting apps for the region. Failing that, the data is tossed. Note: For browsers that have the Navigation Timing API, this is not an issue, as the navigation start time can be determined without using a cookie.",

Here are some additional tips for cached pages: Java: Flush the app server’s \"work\" cache.

This forces the app server to recompile ASPs with page load timing instrumentation. Node.js: By default, Node.js does not cache pages. PHP: If you have a CDN cache your dynamic pages, make sure the cache contains the page load timing instrumentation.

      "body": "Problem You are not seeing AJAX data for your browser app. Solution If your application is instrumented with browser monitoring and is correctly collecting data for other Pro features, follow these steps: 1. Verify you use XMLHttpRequest. Check whether your application uses the XMLHttpRequest object to make AJAX calls. Browser monitoring: Other methods (including the newer Fetch API) currently are not supported when using browser Pro. Single-page app monitoring: Fetch is supported for AJAX requests within a browser interaction with SPA monitoring. If you are making requests using JSONP, see JSONP requirements. 2. Verify the object is instrumented. If you are using XMLHttpRequest, use your browser's dev console to verify that the object has been instrumented by New Relic. Enter the object name at your console. If instrumentation has succeeded, the console should return something like: function (t){var e=new p(t);try{u.emit(\"new-xhr\"... Copy If instrumentation failed, you will see something like: function XMLHttpRequest() { [native_code] } Copy If you see this type of failure response, see Troubleshooting browser monitoring installation. If you see a different response, you may be using another script or library that is conflicting with New Relic instrumentation. Contact support at support.newrelic.com. 3. Verify network access. If the object is properly instrumented, try triggering an AJAX call in your application while monitoring network traffic in the browser's developer tools. Wait up to one minute, and look for a call to bam.nr-data.net/jserrors with an xhr parameter. If the call fails, check for network issues. If you don't see this call, if it fails with an error not related to network access, or if it succeeds but you still aren't seeing data, get support at support.newrelic.com. If your requests use JSONP, see requirements and notes on functionality below: JSONP requirements If your requests use JSONP, these requests will not appear on the AJAX UI page. However, you can view them as assets within session traces. If using SPA monitoring, you can view them on the Breakdown tab of the Page views page. Requirements for JSONP to be recognized: Each JSONP request must use a unique callback function. Most popular libraries (like jQuery) generate a unique callback function dynamically for each request. The query string callback must be named \"callback\" or \"cb\" in order to be recognized by New Relic. This is the default behavior in most popular libraries.",

      "body": "Our Python agent monitors your Python application to help you identify and solve performance issues. You can also extend your performance monitoring to collect and analyze business data to help you improve the customer experience and make data-driven business decisions. With flexible options for custom instrumentation and APIs, The Python agent offers multiple building blocks to customize the data you need from your app. Our Python works with a wide variety of web frameworks and hosting mechanisms, including Django, Gunicorn, WSGI, CherryPy, uWSGI, and more. You can also install the Python agent in a Google App Engine flexible environment. Monitor app performance After you install the Python agent, it begins to collect data about your app. You can view the data as charts and tables in New Relic One. View the big picture of your app. Monitor your app's Apdex (user satisfaction). Get a high-level summary of your app with Summary page. Enable distributed tracing to see activity across an architecture having many services. Install Infrastructure monitoring and view detailed server/host data for your app. Find errors and problems quickly. Track key transactions specific to your business. Create custom dashboards for important metrics. Alert your team when an error or problem occurs before it affects your users. View performance after a deployment. Drill down into performance details. Examine code-level transaction traces. Examine database query traces. Examine error traces. Use thread profiler sessions to see detailed stack traces of sampled threads View logs for your APM and infrastructure data Bring your logs and application's data together to make troubleshooting easier and faster. No need to switch to another UI page in New Relic One. With logs in context, you can see log messages related to your errors and traces directly in your app's UI. You can also see logs in context of your infrastructure data, such as Kubernetes clusters. Extend agent instrumentation Other helpful tools include: Tools Description Browser monitoring Integrate the Python agent with browser monitoring to gain visibility into end-user browser activity. Simple scripts and background tasks Monitor job-based or task queuing systems, like Celery, or other standalone non-web functions. Business data analysis with data exploration. Use the Python agent with our data explorer to organize, query, and visualize your data to answer key questions about application performance and customer experience. Use default transaction attributes, or add your own. Query your data using the New Relic Query Language (NRQL). Send your own event data. Create and share customizable, interactive dashboards. Install the Python agent Before you install the Python agent, make sure your system meets the system requirements. You must also create a New Relic account. We support a number of web frameworks and libraries right out of the box, including Django, WSGI, and Gunicorn. If you use one of the supported web frameworks, installation is easy. If you use an unsupported framework, the process will involve some additions to your app code and/or web server files. For a quick and simple install process that will work for the majority of setups, follow these simple steps: Download and install the Python package. Create config file. Integrate the Python agent with your application. Read the Quick Start guide Add Python data Monitor non-web scripts, background tasks, and functions The Python agent also lets you monitor non-web scripts, worker processes, tasks, and functions. The installation process for these non-web transactions is similar to the one used for a web app, with one major difference: instead of going through the standard integration process described in the install instructions, you would manually \"wrap\" any function you want to monitor. For more information, see Non-web tasks and processes. For instructions on monitoring Celery tasks, see Celery background tasks. What's next after installation? Once you get the agent up and running, some suggested next steps are: Explore your data in and get comfortable with the user interface. Read our docs on our other observability solutions and the APM page. Change your application's name, or other configuration options. Learn about setting up custom instrumentation for application activity not monitored by default. Consider the Python Telemetry SDK. Troubleshooting After you complete the install process, your data should appear in the APM UI within five minutes. If it does not, use these troubleshooting resources: If no data appears, follow these troubleshooting steps. If you experience issues when installing or running the Python agent on a new host, test that the package is installed correctly and that it can contact New Relic's data collector service. For other problems, see the full list of troubleshooting documentation. Check the source code The Python agent is open source software. That means you can browse its source code and send improvements, or create your own fork and build it. For more information, see the README.",

      "body": "Browser monitoring's JavaScript snippet introduces a nearly invisible impact on website performance and user perception of the time it takes a page to load. The JavaScript is included in a packet of webpage data that is sent anyway. In addition, it immediately begins monitoring for errors and events as the rest of the webpage executes. The negligible amount of overhead required to load the JavaScript results in a significant return of actionable data. Overall impact The JavaScript's overhead takes into consideration both the impact on the user and the impact on your systems' performance: User perception: Typically users cannot detect performance degradations on a website of less than 200ms. Browser's JavaScript adds less than 15ms in aggregated time per page load. This is split up over time, so at no point would a user be able to perceive any performance impact due to the JavaScript. Webserver and systems: Browser app monitoring occurs on the user's browser, not on the server. Processing time does not have an impact on your CPU consumption. In addition, we take additional steps to minimize any potential impact on the apps and webpages being monitored. For example, the \"loader\" script is loaded synchronously in the <HEAD> in order to ensure monitoring is enabled for the entire life cycle of the page. This script is included inline, which eliminates the need for another roundtrip network request to a content delivery network (CDN). The \"loader\" comes with the initial page load. Later in the life cycle of the page, New Relic loads an additional monitoring script asynchronously. This script should not have any perceivable effect to the user and is included in the overall overhead of less than 15ms per page. Network impact Browser monitoring also minimizes network traffic for the end user by aggregating data locally (in the client) and sending it back to New Relic on load, at periodic intervals, on unload, or when data has been collected. (During the browser session's idle periods, transmissions may not be required.) Browser agent scripts The agent consists of two scripts. The first script is inserted inline into the HTML document. The second script is downloaded from the content delivery network (js-agent.newrelic.com) when the window load event happens. Find out about browser agent types here. Script Lite Pro Pro + SPA Inline script size 8.3 KB 22 KB 27 KB Downloaded script size 27 KB 27 KB 38 KB Browser agent harvests Data type Lite Pro Pro + SPA Harvest frequency Page view metrics/events yes yes yes One call. Once the second script is downloaded, we immediately make the first harvest call, which generates page view metrics and the PageView event. This is a JSONP call to bam.nr-data.net or bam-cell.nr-data.net. PageViewTiming events yes yes yes All agent types collect PageViewTiming events. The first harvest happens 10 seconds after the agent initializes, after window load event. After that, we send additional PageViewTiming events every 30 seconds, but only if there's data to send. For information about the event types included in these harvest calls, see the PageViewTiming section of our data dictionary. JavaScriptError metrics/events no yes yes First call when agent initializes; every 60 seconds after that. These calls, sent as metrics data, happen every 60 seconds because we include the Ajax calls that the agent itself makes. This information also applies to Ajax metrics. Ajax metrics no yes yes Sent together with JavaScript errors. Ajax events no yes yes Sent together with BrowserInteraction events. These are collected immediately when an interaction finishes. We only collect interactions for the initial page load and for route changes. We also have an API for generating custom interactions. There will be a separate call for each interaction. Typically, these calls are infrequent because they depend on the user interacting with the page. This information also applies to BrowserInteraction events. Session traces no yes yes First call when agent initializes; after that, every 10 seconds if there is data to send. Session traces send the most data, but they are heavily sampled. Only about 75 page views per hour get enabled to send session trace data. The agent sends data every 10 seconds if it has enough data to send. PageAction events no yes yes First call is made when agent initializes; after that, every 30 seconds if there is data to send. BrowserInteraction events no no yes Sent immediately when an interaction finishes. There will always be at least one interaction that represents the initial page load. Additional interactions are collected only if the URL changes (representing route change). Harvest frequency details for Ajax events apply here as well.",

      "body": "Your end-user experience depends on your entire technology stack. You need to quickly understand what's causing a customer complaint or issue. Did the problem come from your infrastructure, your application, or the browsers that ultimately render it? Is it the result of a problematic internet provider, a problem in your own data center with failing CPU or memory, or something else? Tip This doc gives you detailed information about why our browser monitoring solution matters to your business. But if you want to skip ahead, just sign up for a New Relic account. (It's free, forever!) Then, after you install the browser monitoring agent, you can start working with your data. More than Real User Monitoring (RUM) Many websites contain dynamic content that is loaded after the initial page has finished loading, and complex JavaScript code increases the need for error reporting. Browser monitoring in New Relic One provides a Real User Monitoring (RUM) solution that measures the speed and performance of your end users as they navigate to your site from different web browsers, devices, operating systems, and networks. With browser monitoring in New Relic One, you see actionable data about your end users' experience with your app. But browser monitoring in New Relic goes far beyond the initial page load to measure full page life cycle data. For example, our browser UI shows you: Actual performance data, such as by page view popularity and user satisfaction (Apdex) scores Perceived performance data that measures how quickly your async or dynamic visuals and interactive page contents display JavaScript error analytics, stack traces, and line-of-code visibility, to show you the end-user steps leading up to an error itself Session performance with a detailed timeline and heat map of the load and interaction events during a webpage's full life cycle AJAX requests indicating problems with timing, end points, and specific locations in the webpage Hash-based route changes in apps with single-page application (SPA) architectures These tools (and more!) help your teams optimize your end users' page load experience, eliminate bugs, and troubleshoot faster across your full stack. Examine user perceptions Real user data gives insights into actual page performance, but you also need to look into your users' perception of your site's performance. Pages can load content in many different ways, and users control when they interact with that content. This is why some user-centric performance metrics happen outside the standard window onload (page load time) in the browser monitoring agent. The PageViewTiming event provides a more real-time delivery mechanism that does not have a dependency on any other event. Additional metrics include: First paint, first contentful paint, and largest contentful paint First input delay First interaction This helps you understand how users experience your site, both from visual and responsiveness standpoints. Improve interactive app performance Our single-page app (SPA) monitoring automatically tracks route changes, initial page loads, and synchronous and asynchronous activity during browser interactions. You can also use our browser agent and SPA API to monitor virtually anything that executes inside the browser. If you are a developer, SPA monitoring can help you: Create faster, more responsive, highly interactive apps. Monitor the throughput and performance that real users are experiencing. Troubleshoot and resolve problems within the context of the page load. Query and visualize the data to assist with business decisions. Bring better apps to the marketplace more quickly. Correlate front-end and back-end problems With New Relic One, you can instrument any type of data you need, such as metrics, events, logs, and traces. This helps you find actionable data about your end users' experience across the stack. For example: Type of data Comments Locations or domains Limit browser monitoring to focus on specific geographical locations or specific types of end-user activity. You can also monitor or block specific domains. Trends in interactions Use our comparative charting feature for a direct page load time comparison between real user (browser) interactions and trends appearing in Synthetic monitors. Distributed tracing Isolate latency from the web browser through back-end services with distributed tracing. The UI helps you see the connection across across a full transaction, from browser activity, to time spent in network, to back-end activity. Browser types Explore your end users' experience with your app segmented by any types of browsers they use, including: Top browsers by throughput Average page load time by platform type (mobile, desktop, and other) Selected browser type by version (for example, Chrome 31, 32, 33, etc.) This helps you quickly determine whether problems with page load timing may be related to a specific browser type or platform, or whether the problem is more widespread. Get started with browser monitoring Follow these basic steps, and you'll quickly be up and running in New Relic with browser monitoring! Review the compatibility details and basic requirements for browser monitoring. Install the browser agent. Go to [one.newrelic.com > Explorer > Browser applications. Use the Explorer to access all your entities, that is, anything we can identify that reports data, from applications and hosts to custom groupings of any elements. View summary data from your Browser summary page, then drill down into page load timing details and other UI data. Configure your alerts for key performance data, or use our Applied Intelligence solutions to reduce alert noise, correlate incidents, and automatically detect anomalies. Query and visualize your default data (or customize your own), then analyze what that data says about your business. Customize and share your own charts and dashboards.",

      "body": "Browser monitoring's JavaScript snippet introduces a nearly invisible impact on website performance and user perception of the time it takes a page to load. The JavaScript is included in a packet of webpage data that is sent anyway. In addition, it immediately begins monitoring for errors and events as the rest of the webpage executes. The negligible amount of overhead required to load the JavaScript results in a significant return of actionable data. Overall impact The JavaScript's overhead takes into consideration both the impact on the user and the impact on your systems' performance: User perception: Typically users cannot detect performance degradations on a website of less than 200ms. Browser's JavaScript adds less than 15ms in aggregated time per page load. This is split up over time, so at no point would a user be able to perceive any performance impact due to the JavaScript. Webserver and systems: Browser app monitoring occurs on the user's browser, not on the server. Processing time does not have an impact on your CPU consumption. In addition, we take additional steps to minimize any potential impact on the apps and webpages being monitored. For example, the \"loader\" script is loaded synchronously in the <HEAD> in order to ensure monitoring is enabled for the entire life cycle of the page. This script is included inline, which eliminates the need for another roundtrip network request to a content delivery network (CDN). The \"loader\" comes with the initial page load. Later in the life cycle of the page, New Relic loads an additional monitoring script asynchronously. This script should not have any perceivable effect to the user and is included in the overall overhead of less than 15ms per page. Network impact Browser monitoring also minimizes network traffic for the end user by aggregating data locally (in the client) and sending it back to New Relic on load, at periodic intervals, on unload, or when data has been collected. (During the browser session's idle periods, transmissions may not be required.) Browser agent scripts The agent consists of two scripts. The first script is inserted inline into the HTML document. The second script is downloaded from the content delivery network (js-agent.newrelic.com) when the window load event happens. Find out about browser agent types here. Script Lite Pro Pro + SPA Inline script size 8.3 KB 22 KB 27 KB Downloaded script size 27 KB 27 KB 38 KB Browser agent harvests Data type Lite Pro Pro + SPA Harvest frequency Page view metrics/events yes yes yes One call. Once the second script is downloaded, we immediately make the first harvest call, which generates page view metrics and the PageView event. This is a JSONP call to bam.nr-data.net or bam-cell.nr-data.net. PageViewTiming events yes yes yes All agent types collect PageViewTiming events. The first harvest happens 10 seconds after the agent initializes, after window load event. After that, we send additional PageViewTiming events every 30 seconds, but only if there's data to send. For information about the event types included in these harvest calls, see the PageViewTiming section of our data dictionary. JavaScriptError metrics/events no yes yes First call when agent initializes; every 60 seconds after that. These calls, sent as metrics data, happen every 60 seconds because we include the Ajax calls that the agent itself makes. This information also applies to Ajax metrics. Ajax metrics no yes yes Sent together with JavaScript errors. Ajax events no yes yes Sent together with BrowserInteraction events. These are collected immediately when an interaction finishes. We only collect interactions for the initial page load and for route changes. We also have an API for generating custom interactions. There will be a separate call for each interaction. Typically, these calls are infrequent because they depend on the user interacting with the page. This information also applies to BrowserInteraction events. Session traces no yes yes First call when agent initializes; after that, every 10 seconds if there is data to send. Session traces send the most data, but they are heavily sampled. Only about 75 page views per hour get enabled to send session trace data. The agent sends data every 10 seconds if it has enough data to send. PageAction events no yes yes First call is made when agent initializes; after that, every 30 seconds if there is data to send. BrowserInteraction events no no yes Sent immediately when an interaction finishes. There will always be at least one interaction that represents the initial page load. Additional interactions are collected only if the URL changes (representing route change). Harvest frequency details for Ajax events apply here as well.",

      "body": "The Page views page in browser monitoring provides insight into the performance of your site's pages. Sort options allow you to view details by percentage of page load time, average page load time, or throughput. Detailed information about the top webpages viewed, timing and throughput details, and links to browser traces or session traces also are available as applicable. Browser also offers single-page app (SPA) monitoring. If you have opted in to SPA monitoring, your SPA Page views page will be different. View summary information Browser monitoring lists page views as URLs. This makes it easy to identify specific front-end page views; for example, /browse/plans. In addition: For browser apps that are also monitored by APM, you can view the back-end transactions associated with the page view; for example, ApplicationsController#Show. For URLs that are also monitored by Synthetics, you can use New Relic's comparative charting feature. This provides a direct page load time comparison between real user (browser) interactions and trends appearing in Synthetics monitors. one.newrelic.com > Browser > (select an app) > Page views: This page provides detailed information about page load time, throughput, top transactions, and traces. To view detailed information about which pages the end users are viewing for your app: Go to one.newrelic.com > Browser > (select an app) > Page views. Select the time period or sort order, or keep the defaults. If available, select the type of view for page load timing information as a chart (default), histogram, or percentile. To view summary information about a specific transaction, mouse over the transaction's name on the list. To compare page load time between real user (browser) interactions and trends appearing in Synthetic monitors, select a page monitored by Synthetics, then examine additional comparative charting details. Examine timing details for page loads The Browser page load time chart view shows the average page load time broken down into segments. This chart also appears on the Summary page and Browsers detail page. one.newrelic.com > Browser > (select an app) > Page views: The Browser page load time chart shows the average page load time broken down into segments indicating the end users' experience (sometimes referred to as real user monitoring or RUM). The page load timing process shows colored-coded details: Page load timing process Description Request queuing (black) Wait time between the web server and the application code. Large numbers indicate a busy application server. Web application (purple) Time spent in the application code. Network (brown) The network latency, or the time it takes for a request to make a round trip over the Internet. For apps that have been deployed using the copy/paste method, Browser includes web app and queue time in Network time. DOM processing (yellow) In the browser, parsing and interpreting the HTML. Measured by the browser's DOMContent event. Page rendering (blue) In the browser, the time to display the HTML, run the inline JavaScript, and load images. Measured by the browser's Load event. \"Additional\" timing data If you are using the JavaScript API, your \"additional\" timing data appears in this chart. Examine page view details Use any of New Relic's standard user interface functions to drill down into detailed information. In addition, to view details about a specific page view, select its name from the list. To close an individual page view and return to the Page views page, select X (Close).

      "body": "Browser monitoring's JavaScript snippet introduces a nearly invisible impact on website performance and user perception of the time it takes a page to load. The JavaScript is included in a packet of webpage data that is sent anyway. In addition, it immediately begins monitoring for errors and events as the rest of the webpage executes. The negligible amount of overhead required to load the JavaScript results in a significant return of actionable data. Overall impact The JavaScript's overhead takes into consideration both the impact on the user and the impact on your systems' performance: User perception: Typically users cannot detect performance degradations on a website of less than 200ms. Browser's JavaScript adds less than 15ms in aggregated time per page load. This is split up over time, so at no point would a user be able to perceive any performance impact due to the JavaScript. Webserver and systems: Browser app monitoring occurs on the user's browser, not on the server. Processing time does not have an impact on your CPU consumption. In addition, we take additional steps to minimize any potential impact on the apps and webpages being monitored. For example, the \"loader\" script is loaded synchronously in the <HEAD> in order to ensure monitoring is enabled for the entire life cycle of the page. This script is included inline, which eliminates the need for another roundtrip network request to a content delivery network (CDN). The \"loader\" comes with the initial page load. Later in the life cycle of the page, New Relic loads an additional monitoring script asynchronously. This script should not have any perceivable effect to the user and is included in the overall overhead of less than 15ms per page. Network impact Browser monitoring also minimizes network traffic for the end user by aggregating data locally (in the client) and sending it back to New Relic on load, at periodic intervals, on unload, or when data has been collected. (During the browser session's idle periods, transmissions may not be required.) Browser agent scripts The agent consists of two scripts. The first script is inserted inline into the HTML document. The second script is downloaded from the content delivery network (js-agent.newrelic.com) when the window load event happens. Find out about browser agent types here. Script Lite Pro Pro + SPA Inline script size 8.3 KB 22 KB 27 KB Downloaded script size 27 KB 27 KB 38 KB Browser agent harvests Data type Lite Pro Pro + SPA Harvest frequency Page view metrics/events yes yes yes One call. Once the second script is downloaded, we immediately make the first harvest call, which generates page view metrics and the PageView event. This is a JSONP call to bam.nr-data.net or bam-cell.nr-data.net. PageViewTiming events yes yes yes All agent types collect PageViewTiming events. The first harvest happens 10 seconds after the agent initializes, after window load event. After that, we send additional PageViewTiming events every 30 seconds, but only if there's data to send. For information about the event types included in these harvest calls, see the PageViewTiming section of our data dictionary. JavaScriptError metrics/events no yes yes First call when agent initializes; every 60 seconds after that. These calls, sent as metrics data, happen every 60 seconds because we include the Ajax calls that the agent itself makes. This information also applies to Ajax metrics. Ajax metrics no yes yes Sent together with JavaScript errors. Ajax events no yes yes Sent together with BrowserInteraction events. These are collected immediately when an interaction finishes. We only collect interactions for the initial page load and for route changes. We also have an API for generating custom interactions. There will be a separate call for each interaction. Typically, these calls are infrequent because they depend on the user interacting with the page. This information also applies to BrowserInteraction events. Session traces no yes yes First call when agent initializes; after that, every 10 seconds if there is data to send. Session traces send the most data, but they are heavily sampled. Only about 75 page views per hour get enabled to send session trace data. The agent sends data every 10 seconds if it has enough data to send. PageAction events no yes yes First call is made when agent initializes; after that, every 30 seconds if there is data to send. BrowserInteraction events no no yes Sent immediately when an interaction finishes. There will always be at least one interaction that represents the initial page load. Additional interactions are collected only if the URL changes (representing route change). Harvest frequency details for Ajax events apply here as well.",

Make this call before the window load event fires (when that data is transmitted) in order for the attributes to be included in the PageView event.

The name will be exposed as the browserInteractionName attribute in the BrowserInteraction event. It will also be used for grouping in the UI.

The name will be exposed as the browserInteractionName attribute in the BrowserInteraction event. It will also be used for grouping in the UI.

This event will appear in the browser session trace details. If a session trace currently is in progress, this adds an object with a user-defined name, start time, and other optional fields.

Requirements Agent version nr-963 or higher. Description This SPA monitoring method sets the name and trigger of a browser interaction. The name will be exposed as the browserInteractionName attribute in the BrowserInteraction event. It will also be used for grouping in the UI. By default, browserInteractionName is named after an associated URL or route. Use setName() when you want to record an interaction that is not a route change or URL change. The setCurrentRouteName() method also names the current route. When you use both: setName() takes precedence for naming the interaction. The previousRouteName and targetRouteName attributes are still set with values passed to setCurrentRouteName(). Using these methods together allows many options for filtering and grouping in the UI. For example, you can: Filter down to interactions of a certain type, such as LikeButtonClick. Then, group by targetRouteName to see what routes have the most LikeButtonClick interactions. Tip This API call applies to data in SPA page views in browser and the BrowserInteraction event type within New Relic One. To set a custom name for standard page views and the PageView event type, see setPageViewName. Using both calls together is recommended. Parameters Parameter Description $name string Required. If null, the name will be set using the targetGroupedUrl attribute. If not null, this will set the browserInteractionName attribute in the BrowserInteraction event. $trigger string Optional. If not null, this will set the TRIGGER attribute on the BrowserInteraction event. Return values This method returns the same API object created by interaction().

Requirements Agent version nr-963 or higher. Description This SPA monitoring method sets the name and trigger of a browser interaction. The name will be exposed as the browserInteractionName attribute in the BrowserInteraction event. It will also be used for grouping in the UI. By default, browserInteractionName is named after an associated URL or route. Use setName() when you want to record an interaction that is not a route change or URL change. The setCurrentRouteName() method also names the current route. When you use both: setName() takes precedence for naming the interaction. The previousRouteName and targetRouteName attributes are still set with values passed to setCurrentRouteName(). Using these methods together allows many options for filtering and grouping in the UI. For example, you can: Filter down to interactions of a certain type, such as LikeButtonClick. Then, group by targetRouteName to see what routes have the most LikeButtonClick interactions. Tip This API call applies to data in SPA page views in browser and the BrowserInteraction event type within New Relic One. To set a custom name for standard page views and the PageView event type, see setPageViewName. Using both calls together is recommended. Parameters Parameter Description $name string Required. If null, the name will be set using the targetGroupedUrl attribute. If not null, this will set the browserInteractionName attribute in the BrowserInteraction event. $trigger string Optional. If not null, this will set the TRIGGER attribute on the BrowserInteraction event. Return values This method returns the same API object created by interaction().

Requirements Agent version nr-963 or higher. Description This SPA monitoring method sets the name and trigger of a browser interaction. The name will be exposed as the browserInteractionName attribute in the BrowserInteraction event. It will also be used for grouping in the UI. By default, browserInteractionName is named after an associated URL or route. Use setName() when you want to record an interaction that is not a route change or URL change. The setCurrentRouteName() method also names the current route. When you use both: setName() takes precedence for naming the interaction. The previousRouteName and targetRouteName attributes are still set with values passed to setCurrentRouteName(). Using these methods together allows many options for filtering and grouping in the UI. For example, you can: Filter down to interactions of a certain type, such as LikeButtonClick. Then, group by targetRouteName to see what routes have the most LikeButtonClick interactions. Tip This API call applies to data in SPA page views in browser and the BrowserInteraction event type within New Relic One. To set a custom name for standard page views and the PageView event type, see setPageViewName. Using both calls together is recommended. Parameters Parameter Description $name string Required. If null, the name will be set using the targetGroupedUrl attribute. If not null, this will set the browserInteractionName attribute in the BrowserInteraction event. $trigger string Optional. If not null, this will set the TRIGGER attribute on the BrowserInteraction event. Return values This method returns the same API object created by interaction().

Requirements Agent version nr-593 or higher. Description Adds a user-defined attribute name and value to subsequent events on the page. Make this call before the window load event fires (when that data is transmitted) in order for the attributes to be included in the PageView event. Once an attribute is set, New Relic One records it with all PageAction events until the page is reloaded or the attribute is manually unset.

The name will be exposed as the browserInteractionName attribute in the BrowserInteraction event. It will also be used for grouping in the UI.

Requirements Agent version nr-963 or higher. Description This SPA monitoring method sets the name and trigger of a browser interaction. The name will be exposed as the browserInteractionName attribute in the BrowserInteraction event. It will also be used for grouping in the UI. By default, browserInteractionName is named after an associated URL or route. Use setName() when you want to record an interaction that is not a route change or URL change. The setCurrentRouteName() method also names the current route. When you use both: setName() takes precedence for naming the interaction. The previousRouteName and targetRouteName attributes are still set with values passed to setCurrentRouteName(). Using these methods together allows many options for filtering and grouping in the UI. For example, you can: Filter down to interactions of a certain type, such as LikeButtonClick. Then, group by targetRouteName to see what routes have the most LikeButtonClick interactions. Tip This API call applies to data in SPA page views in browser and the BrowserInteraction event type within New Relic One. To set a custom name for standard page views and the PageView event type, see setPageViewName. Using both calls together is recommended. Parameters Parameter Description $name string Required. If null, the name will be set using the targetGroupedUrl attribute. If not null, this will set the browserInteractionName attribute in the BrowserInteraction event. $trigger string Optional. If not null, this will set the TRIGGER attribute on the BrowserInteraction event. Return values This method returns the same API object created by interaction(). Examples document.getElementById('subscribe').addEventListener('submit', () => { newrelic.interaction().setName('createSubscription') createSubscription() }) Copy",

      "body": "Problem You have enabled distributed tracing but data you expected to see does not appear in New Relic's distributed tracing UI. Solution Important Before performing troubleshooting, we recommend reading How distributed tracing works. Here are some causes and solutions when you have problems finding expected data in the distributed tracing UI: Problems with enabling or instrumenting Missing spans due to service not having distributed tracing enabled In order for distributed tracing to report details for all nodes in a trace, each application must be monitored by a New Relic agent that has had distributed tracing enabled. If an application's New Relic account has not had distributed tracing enabled, it will have these issues: Its distributed tracing UI page won't have data. It won't report data to other accounts' distributed traces. Missing apps/services may require manual instrumentation When you enable distributed tracing for applications and services that New Relic automatically instruments, you'll usually see complete and detailed data for those nodes in the distributed tracing UI. However, you may notice that some services or applications are missing from traces, or that there are some internal spans you expect to see that are missing. If that's the case, you may want to implement custom instrumentation of applications or specific transactions to see more detail in traces. Some examples of when you may need to do this: Transactions not automatically instrumented. To ensure your application is automatically instrumented, read the compatibility and requirements documentation for the New Relic agent you're using. If an application isn't automatically instrumented, or if you'd like to add instrumentation of specific activity, see Custom instrumentation. All Go applications. The Go agent, unlike other agents, requires manual instrumentation of your code. For instructions, see Instrument a Go application. A service doesn't use HTTP. If a service doesn't communicate via HTTP, the New Relic agent won't send distributed tracing headers. This may be the case for some non-web applications or message queues. To remedy this, use the distributed tracing APIs to instrument either the calling or called application. Problems with spans Infinite Tracing: missing spans If your APM agent can’t write data fast enough to the trace observer, queue_size is an additional APM agent configuration to limit the number of spans the agent will hold. See the following examples for your agent: .NET configuration method Example Configuration file <configuration . . . > <infiniteTracing> <trace_observer> <span_events queue_size=\"100000\" /> </trace_observer> </infiniteTracing> </configuration> Copy Environment variable NEW_RELIC_INFINITE_TRACING_SPAN_EVENTS_QUEUE_SIZE=100000 Copy Python configuration method Example Configuration file infinite_tracing.span_queue_size = 100000 Environment Variable NEW_RELIC_INFINITE_TRACING_SPAN_QUEUE_SIZE = 100000 Missing span not getting exported Sometimes header propagation is successful, but the span information isn't getting sent to New Relic. For example, if OpenTelemetry is not instrumented with a New Relic exporter, the span details never make it to New Relic. In this diagram, notice that the header propagation is successful, but no exporter is set up in Service 2 to send the span to New Relic: The following diagram also shows successful header propagation, but it includes an exporter in Service 2 that sends the span details to New Relic (see Trace API): Missing spans due to sampling process Standard distributed tracing for APM uses adaptive sampling. This means that a percentage of calls to a service will be reported as part of a distributed trace. Specific calls to your service might not have been selected to be sampled. Missing spans due to span limits maxed out There are limits on the number of spans that can be collected and displayed. If an application generates a very large number of spans for a single call, it might exceed the APM agent's span-collection limit for that harvest cycle. This could result in missing spans and significantly limit the number of traces the agent can completely sample and report. We currently only show 10,000 spans at a time. Missing spans due to spans being sent late Spans must be sent within the last twenty minutes to be captured in a trace index. If you send any spans older than twenty minutes but newer than a day, the span data will still be written. However, it won't be rolled into the trace index, which controls the trace list in the distributed tracing UI. If a span has a timestamp older than a day, it will be dropped. This often occurs when there is clock skew (timing differences) between systems or long running background jobs. Problems with trace details Middleware doesn't recognize proprietary New Relic header If your transactions are only sending the proprietary New Relic header, some middleware might not recognize the format and then drop the information as shown in this diagram: One solution is to upgrade your New Relic agent to a version that supports W3C trace context. In the diagram below, the W3C-compliant New Relic agent passes the prior header along with two standardized headers: An intermediary is missing or isn't passing trace context Some potential problems with proxies and other intermediaries: Incomplete trace. Some intermediaries won't automatically propagate the distributed tracing header. In that case, you must configure that component to allow the header to be passed from source to destination. For instructions, consult the documentation for that intermediary component. Missing intermediary in trace. If the intermediary is New Relic-monitored, ensure that it propagates the newrelic header that is generated or updated by the New Relic agent running on that intermediary. This may manifest when an intermediary was previously visible in traces, but disappeared after distributed tracing was enabled for an upstream entity (for example, a browser-monitored application). Tip If some entities report trace data to another tracing system, you can use the trace ID from the New Relic UI to search other tracing systems for missing spans. Stitching together spans from mixed sources If each agent in a chain supports W3C Trace Context, then we can stitch the spans together into a complete trace. If part of the chain is from an agent, such as Zipkin, which doesn't support W3C Trace Context, then spans coming from that agent may not be included in the trace. Trace details are obfuscated If a trace contains data from applications monitored by multiple New Relic accounts, and your user permissions don't allow you to access those accounts, some of the span and service details will be obfuscated in the UI. For example, you may see a series of asterisks ( * * * * * ) instead of the service name in your distributed tracing list if you don't have access to the account linked with the service. Trace list information and trace details don't match The trace list is generated by trace indexes, which are captured in a twenty minute window from when the first spans are received. Usually, this is due to late spans. Long traces with short backend times If you're seeing unusually short backend times for long traces, this is likely an issue with the timestamps being sent. For example, the root span might be reposting microseconds as milliseconds. This can also happen if the root span is a browser application. When using an external client like a web browser, you may experience clock skew (timing differences) more often. Problems with browser applications Missing spans and transactions after enabling for a browser application Older versions of some APM agents are incompatible with distributed tracing for browser applications. If the browser application makes an AJAX request to an APM application running an incompatible agent, then the APM agent may not record transaction and span data for that request. If distributed tracing is enabled for a browser application and you are not seeing transaction or span data for downstream APM requests, review the browser data in distributed tracing requirements, and confirm that all applications are running supported versions of the APM agent. Not seeing browser app end-user spans If traces seem to be missing end-user spans, be sure you've read and understand the browser distributed tracing requirements and enable procedures. On the AJAX UI page, there are links to the distributed tracing UI regardless of whether there are end-user spans present in that trace. For details about what data generates spans, see Requirements. Browser spans are not connected to other spans Older versions of some APM agents are incompatible with distributed tracing for browser applications. If APM spans are missing consistently from traces that include browser applications, please refer to the browser data in distributed tracing requirements and confirm that all applications are running supported versions of the APM agent. For other causes of orphaned browser spans, see Browser span reporting. Other problems Search by entity.name not finding associated app names Potential cause: For applications that have multiple app names, the entity.name attribute will be associated only with the primary app name. To search by other app names, search using the appName attribute. Supporting OpenTelemetry Questions about integrating with OpenTelemetry should be taken to the Explorers Hub.",

      "body": "New features Support for End User Originated Spans in Distributed Tracing New Relic now supports end-to-end distributed tracing with this release. For our Browser & APM Pro customers, you can now enable the Browser spans for any app that uses our Browser Pro + SPA agent. This MVP includes support for same-origin AJAX requests that originate during a BrowserInteraction event. This AJAX request will be listed as the root entry span for a trace. Learn More For more details about APM & Browser agent version requirements and enablement, see our Browser Data in Distributed Tracing Page. Please note that not all APM agents are supported at this time. For more details about all supported Span attributes, visit our Event Data Dictionary Known Issues Enabling Browser in Distributed Tracing for use with current versions of these language agents, Java, PHP, and C, will result in disconnected traces (single span traces for all Browser requests) and potentially the loss of APM transaction traces and spans. Please see the APM compatibility requirements for supported versions and estimated release dates. New PageViewTiming Event to capture User Centric Perceived Performance metrics in real time With this release, we are tying together the visual and responsiveness performance for our customer's site. With every page view, the agent is now capturing the time of the first interaction along with FID (First Input Delay). The existing paint timing metrics (First Paint and First Contentful Paint) are now collected even when they occur after the load event. All of these new metrics are captured on the new PageViewTiming events, available in Insights. This new event type is available for all agents, but requires a Browser Pro subscription. Visit our New Relic Event Data Dictionary for a list of attributes and more details about the PageViewTiming event. First Interaction First Interaction timing captures the moment in time that a user first engages with a site. Within this timing, we also capture the type of interaction (click, key, mousedown, etc). This timing represents the first step in calculating the First Input Delay, which is the time from First Interaction to the moment that the site responds (is interactive). First Input Delay FID is a metric that tracks the delay between the time a user can attempt to interact with a part of the site (for example, when they click a link, tap on a button, or use a custom, JavaScript-powered control), and the time that the interface is able to respond to that interaction. We have all experienced situations where a webpage has visibly loaded, but when we try to click around on buttons or any JavaScript-powered interactive elements, nothing responds. This delay is what the FID metric tracks. The FID metric is in some ways an intersection of the First Contentful Paint and Time to Interactive metrics. It lies in the middle of those two points, measuring the time between the FCP (and therefore when a first input can be made) and when the browser’s main thread is able to respond to any interactions. One major point of FID that differentiates it from Time to Interactive is that it requires a user to interact! TTI can be calculated without user input, so it is somewhat less powerful in the sense that it isn't providing any new information about my user's active experience or frustration, we can only assume that slow = bad. Why only consider the first input Learn more For more information and query examples, see our PageViewTiming event documentation. For more information about the Paint Timing browser compatibility, see the Browser compatibility and requirements documentation. For more information about User-Centric Perceived Performance metrics, visit the Google Developers Web Fundamentals Guides on Performance. For more information about the difference between FID and TTI, see When Users Click: Tracking First Input Delay Improvements Browser interactions now wait on external scripts to finish loading: Browser interactions measure the time of all Javascript code that runs as a result of an interaction. The agent now includes the time it takes to load and execute external scripts. This is useful, for example, when the code started by an interaction must be loaded first (lazy loading).

Manager See a list of errors and failures so you can coordinate mobile app teams with backend teams and share the data they need to fix issues. QA engineer Make sure that a new version of your app does not cause a spike in errors compared to a previous version. DevOps engineer See a list of domains and URLs associated with HTTP errors and network failures, so you can focus on the ones that are causing errors and filter out status codes that are too noisy for your alerts. Mobile developer Find out if there are frontend or backend problems affecting your mobile app (even without an error alert going off) so that you can address them in a new version. Support engineer View the errors and session attributes (geography, connection type, device, app version) associated with an error so that you can help customers with their issues. Find and use the HTTP errors page There are two ways to get to the HTTP errors page: Go to one.newrelic.com > Mobile > (select an app) > Network > Network errors. From a mobile app's Overview page in mobile monitoring, select the HTTP errors/network failures chart title link. From the HTTP errors page, investigate HTTP request and network failures: Use any standard page functions to look for trends in Errors and failures charts. Target specific types of errors and failures by grouping, sorting, and filtering the data. Find anomalies in your request errors with HTTP error profiles. Select an error or failure to view details for it. You can also define NRQL alerts that are focused on error types for your critical services or query your app data. Group, sort, and filter errors and failures If you want to do this... Do this... Change how the page groups and sorts errors and network failures Make selections from the Group by and Sort by dropdowns. By default, the Network errors page is grouped by request domain and sorted by errors and failures. Filter for specific errors and network failures Select an error or failure from the Errors and failures list and/or select multiple filters from the Filter dropdown.

Change the time window Select a new time period from the Time picker dropdown. View information for one specific app version Select the version that you want to see charts and lists for in the Versions dropdown. HTTP error profiles Error profiles provide visual details about significant differences in the frequency of different values for HTTP error events. For each attribute, the error profile includes: A pie chart showing how the error's attribute is distributed for values that deviate the most A table comparing the error attribute's distribution to that of other errors This helps you take more of the guesswork out of resolving your mobile application's HTTP errors. You can more easily determine if you safely ignore the error, or if you should attempt to resolve the error with a new deployment, code change, customer communication or other actions. View more details about a specific error To view details about an error or failure, select the Request URL link to be directed to the Error summary page. From the Error summary page, you can view the version information, request attributes, and Response body, as well as get a breakdown of error types for the request URL. View and share error data with query builder To explore the data behind any of the charts or lists on the HTTP errors/requests page: Select for any chart. Select View query and then View in Insights. This will open the query builder. From the query builder, you can add the error data to a dashboard and share it via a permalink. To dig deeper into the error data, query your data for the following events and attributes: MobileRequestError events and attributes MobileRequest events and attributes View legacy HTTP errors UI page Accounts that do not have an Enterprise-level subscription see a different HTTP Errors UI page: The Errors page includes details about HTTP errors (403, 404, 422, 500, 502, etc.) and network failures for your hosts; for example: Secure connection failed Timed out Cannot find host Not connected to Internet Cannot connect to host View the Errors page To view HTTP errors or network failures for your mobile app: Go to one.newrelic.com > Mobile > (select an app) > Network > Errors.

To view details for a specific host, HTTP status error, or network failure, select its name. Use any of our standard user interface functions to drill down into detailed information. Error trace details Mobile monitoring will capture the response details from HTTP requests that return a 400 or 500 level status code. In addition, error messages generated from Android apps will include a stack trace. To view details about an error trace on the Errors page, select its request URL link. From here you can: View the response body. Share the error details with others by email. Delete or hide the error. The errors chart also appears on the selected mobile app's Overview page. If the chart shows errors, you can select its HTTP errors/network failures title or select anywhere on the Overview page's chart to go directly to this Errors page. View error data in query builder To dig deeper into your request data, use the query builder to query and chart the MobileRequest events and attributes. Unknown errors or URL errors The mobile agents maintain a list of exception types. In some cases, custom exceptions thrown by applications fall outside of this list. When this happens, Unknown may appear in the mobile Errors page.

      "body": "New Relic's APM Errors page helps you identify, triage, and fix errors in your services. The Errors page uses data collected by the APM agent to display stack traces, transaction attributes such as HTTP header values, and any other custom attributes, so you can understand the context of the error and fix it. View logs for your APM and infrastructure data You can also bring your logs and application's data together to make troubleshooting easier and faster. With logs in context, you can see log messages related to your errors and traces directly in your app's UI. You can also see logs in context of your infrastructure data, such as Kubernetes clusters. No need to switch to another UI page in New Relic One. Error data types: events and trace details By default, our APM agents collect two type of error data: Events Trace details Events The error event data type includes default attributes, as well as any custom attributes instrumented in your service. It doesn't include a stack trace. Find your events data in the Errors UI as follows: The Errors column in the Error traces table. The Top 5 errors chart. When you’ve drilled into a grouping of errors, those errors not displaying a stack trace are based on this type of data. You can disable Show only errors with stack trace to show errors that have this type of data collected, but no associated trace details. Events are subject to sampling (see Caps on error reporting and Charting error rates and counts). For more on error event data, see Events reported by APM. Trace details The trace details error data type includes stack traces and attributes, and supplements events with more data. It's expected that more events will be reported than trace details--see Caps on error reporting. Find your trace details data in the Errors UI as follows: The Stack traces column of the Error traces table. When you’ve drilled into a grouping of errors, those errors with a stack trace use this type of data. Show only errors with stack trace is enabled by default, to constrain the errors shown to just those that have this type of data collected. This data is governed by specific retention rules for Error details. Caps on error reporting New Relic caps error reporting at: 100 events per minute per agent instance 20 trace details per minute per agent instance These caps prevent error reporting from negatively impacting application performance. Examples: App running across five EC2 instances, one JVM each. New Relic caps error reporting at: 100 events per minute x 5 instances = 500 events per minute 20 trace details per minute x 5 instances = 100 trace details per minute App running on one host with ten instances. New Relic caps error reporting at: 100 events per minute x 10 instances = 1000 events per minute 20 trace details per minute x 10 instances = 200 events per minute Charting error rates and counts The Error rate chart is driven by a query on metric timeslice data, which is an unsampled aggregate data type that is accurate but has very limited dimensionality. This data can't be faceted or filtered as flexibly as error event data. You can reproduce this chart in a dashboard, or explore the metric timeslice data further by clicking the ... menu on the Error rate chart, and then using the View query or Add to dashboard options. To chart faceted error counts using event data, as in the Top 5 errors chart, use an NRQL event query. Click the ... menu on the Top 5 errors chart and choose View query for a starting point in creating your chart. Since event data can be sampled (see Caps on error reporting), you can use the EXTRAPOLATE keyword to get an accurate error count, even if sampling is occurring. Report custom errors You can report errors not collected by default with our agents using our agent APIs. For more, see the documentation on the API. Ignore errors You can prevent certain errors that would normally be reported to New Relic from being collected using our agent APIs or the server-side configuration UI. For more details, see Manage errors in APM. Reduce noise with expected errors Sometimes you want to collect error data, but not have those errors wake you up through alerts. Using the agent API, you can mark such errors as “expected”. They’ll still be visible in the Errors page, but won’t affect your service’s error rate or Apdex metrics. Disable error traces To prevent certain errors from being reported to New Relic, disable them in your agent's configuration file. For most agents, you can ignore certain error codes or disable errors completely. For more information, see your specific agent's configuration documentation: C SDK Go (not applicable; the agent only reports errors when configured to do so) Java .NET Node.js PHP Python Ruby Delete error traces Caution You cannot recover error traces after you delete them. Deleting errors is currently only available in the legacy Errors Classic UI. If you want to... Do this... Delete all error traces for your app If you have permissions to delete all error traces for an app: Go to one.newrelic.com > APM > (select an app) > More views > Errors (classic). Select Delete all errors. Delete all error traces for your account To delete all error traces for your New Relic account, get support at support.newrelic.com. Delete individual error traces To delete individual error traces, use APM's Errors (classic) page. Drill into an error from the table of errors, then click Delete this error. In addition to deleting error traces, you may also want to delete transaction traces or database/slow SQL traces. This will remove potentially sensitive data while retaining your other application data (such as Apdex, deployment information, etc.).",

Start with the Error rate chart to see at a glance whether there are any unexpected spikes, dips, or patterns with errors in general. Correlate any general patterns on the Top 5 errors chart to alerts occurring during the same time period. Use the groups and filters to examine the error events and attributes in more detail, and look for patterns with error messages, transaction names, or other groupings. Explore and share Error trace table information, including specific stack trace details, logs, and attributes (host, URL, user, custom attributes, etc.) Also review the Error profiles page to guide your investigation into which attribute values might be correlated to the cause of errors, by comparing the frequency of those values between transactions where the error did and didn't occur (only in the old UI). Error rate chart: See patterns immediately Start with the Error rate chart to see at a glance whether there are any unexpected spikes, dips, or patterns with errors in general. For example, are there any spikes near a recent deployment? You may want to change the selected time period to look for other historical patterns. This chart always shows the overall error rate and count for the selected time period, even when you filter the rest of the page. If you want to focus your investigation on a particular type of error, use the Top 5 errors chart or the Error traces table. Top five errors: Correlate to alerts or find significant groupings Use the Top 5 errors chart to identify what error types and how many of those errors occurred during the same time period as the Error rate chart. For example: Is the error spike related to a specific exception class or transaction? Do the top errors point to a new host/container that recently got moved into production? Are the top error messages repeatedly about failed connections by hosts that you know are in a specific region of your organization? Have the chart backgrounds changed color to indicate an alert condition? (Light pink indicates the alert condition's Warning threshold, and dark pink indicates the Critical threshold.) If you want to... Do this... Change the \"top 5\" selection By default, Top 5 errors chart shows the top five errors by error class and transaction name. To group by other attributes, such as error message, host, or custom attribute, use the search bar. Explore or share error trend data The Top 5 errors chart uses error events, which include rich attribute data b default, along with any custom attributes you have added to the error event type. To examine this data in more detail, or to share it with others, select the View query or Add to dashboard links that appear when you click the chart's ... menu. Error traces: Find the line of code and data needed to reproduce the issue The Error traces table groups errors by the attributes you've selected, and links them to relevant detailed error traces. Each row helps you find answers to questions such as: How many of this transaction/class (or custom grouping) occurred within the selected time period? What is the most recent error message? When did this error first and last occur? Sometimes it may be useful to sort error trace data other than from the most to fewest occurrences. You can change the sort order or filter options to focus on just the types of errors that matter the most to you and your teams. For example: Which error has the fewest occurrences (sort on Errors column)? When did a particular error stop (sort on Last occurred)? Once you find the group of errors you want to fix, click a row in the Error traces table to drill down into the stack traces and attribute data that help pinpoint the cause. Examine logs for error details You can bring your logs and application's data together to make troubleshooting easier and faster. With logs in context, you can see log messages related to your errors and traces directly in your app's UI. From the Errors page, click on an error to go to the Error details page. From the error details page, click See logs. To view details related to an individual log message, click directly on the message. With logs in context, you can examine log data directly within your error details. You can also see logs in context of your infrastructure data, such as Kubernetes clusters. No need to switch to another UI page in New Relic One. Expected errors Reduce noisy errors by marking them as “expected errors”. Such errors won't affect reported error rate or Apdex metrics. See Manage errors for more details. Expected errors aren't shown by default on the Errors page. You can show them by turning on the Show N expected errors switch below the Group by bar. Errors outside transactions Using the New Relic agent API, you can record custom errors at any point in the execution of your code. Sometimes, such custom errors will occur when a transaction is not executing, such as in high-volume aynchronous code that doesn't handle an HTTP transaction. Errors outside transactions are shown by default on the Errors page, but you can hide them by turning off the Show N errors outside transactions switch below the Group by bar. Select the time period for error data Use the time picker to examine details of error events over the past week. The error events view is available for up to a seven-day window of data collected over the last eight days. You may notice slight differences in count if your time window is set to ending now. This occurs because the counts for the list and table may be requested at slightly different times as the page auto-refreshes.",

Select Error instances to see event logs and stack traces, if available. Examine events leading up to error The Event log shows the browser interactions, AJAX calls, and traces that led up to an error. Decode your minified JavaScript If your JavaScript is minified, the errors on the JS errors page may not be very useful. To decode minified JavaScript and make these error stack traces more useful, you can upload JavaScript source maps to New Relic. one.newrelic.com > Browser > (select an app) > JS errors: Use this page to group and filter errors, explore stack trace details, and examine trends. Query and visualize JS data New Relic saves JS errors as event data. This allows you to query your error data in the query builder. To run NRQL queries and create dashboards to view or share, query the JavaScriptError event type in the query builder. Use API to monitor handled errors To notice or log your app's handled errors or other miscellaneous errors, use the browser API's noticeError call. Review event logs Important SPA monitoring must be enabled. The event log shows the browser interactions, AJAX calls, and traces that led up to a JS error. This can help you troubleshoot the root cause of errors. one.newrelic.com > Browser > (select an app) > JS errors > (select an error) > Error instances: With SPA monitoring enabled, the event log shows you the activity leading up to an error. To view the Event log (if available): Go to one.newrelic.com > Browser > (select an app) > JS errors > (select an error) > Error instances. The event log will not be visible if there are no events in the event log. For example, if a JS error is occurring after an AJAX request that provides an error message, it could be that your AJAX request doesn't contain the right information. This results in a JS error due to a failed AJAX call. Troubleshoot missing event logs Some reasons for events in the event log not being present: Agent version. To capture event log data your site must have SPA monitoring enabled (browser agent version 1071 or higher). JS error not part of a browser interaction. If the JS error occurs outside of an interaction, the related browser interaction details cannot be captured (for example: if an async JS file experiences an error). A click triggered the JS error. In some cases if the error is a direct result of a click, no associated interactions are captured. Without event logs or stack traces, you can use the error detail charts to analyze the impact the error has by browser type, device type, and URI. View stack traces Stack traces can show you if an error is breaking important functionality, or if it's a less important error. To view an error's stack trace (if available): go to one.newrelic.com > Browser > (select an app) > JS errors > (select an error) > Error instances. Troubleshoot missing stack traces Some reasons why you may not see a stack trace for an error: If errors are not thrown, they will not produce a stack trace. The JS script is hosted on a CDN or another external location, and New Relic can't see the errors originating from those scripts. This can be solved in some cases by using cross-origin resource sharing (CORS). It is an AngularJS error. For more on this, see Missing Angular errors. The error is a SyntaxError or Script error: These occur while the script is loading, so they do not produce a stack trace. Some older browsers may generate errors without a stack trace, or may provide a stack trace that is not usable. You've captured the error before the New Relic agent sees it. If the error occurs during multiple harvest cycles in the same user visit, only error events reported during the first harvest cycle will have a stack trace recorded. Some solutions for reporting stack traces: Use the noticeError API call. Enable development mode. Use the JS errors UI page to get more information, including the event log. The JS errors page is designed to give you actionable information even without a stack trace. Global and generic errors New Relic wraps JavaScript functions to get information about thrown errors via the stack trace. If errors aren't thrown, they won't be available. For example, if you have an AngularJS application, follow the troubleshooting procedures when AngularJS errors do not appear in the UI. For some older browsers, the following errors may be unavailable: SyntaxError or Script error: These occur while the script is loading, so they do not produce a stack trace. In-line JavaScript or event handler errors: These are unwrapped. Errors thrown from third-party scripts that reside on another domain are not available. Errors occurring on older browsers: These may not be able to provide a usable stack trace. In some cases, they may not provide a stack trace at all. Error collection is done by wrapping JavaScript functions, so errors thrown by the browser at a lower level (such as cross-origin resource sharing errors) also are not available.",

This is the easiest way to install the agent for an app that's already being monitored by APM. APM-monitored apps are listed on your APM Applications index. Enable with copy/paste When enabling browser monitoring, you can manually insert the JavaScript snippet into your app's webpages. The copy/paste option gives you control over the exact placement of our JavaScript snippet, which is required to monitor the webpage's performance. This is useful for: Standalone apps, static sites, and cached pages delivered by CDN APM apps that are not as closely coupled to the browser app as with a standard server-side app (for example, when your client-side app talks to a REST API back end) Some tips for using the JavaScript snippet: Placement in your webpage: Copy the code snippet, then paste it inline into your pages as close to the top of the <head> element as possible, but after any position-sensitive <meta> tags (for example, X-UA-Compatible or charset information). For more information on the inline head placement, see JavaScript placement requirements. License key and app ID: Near the bottom of the generated JavaScript is your browser license key and application ID. This is useful with the REST API and API Explorer. Instrument webpages using the APM agent This information applies to apps that are also monitored by APM. Our APM agents can instrument webpages with the required JavaScript for page load timing. If you are using an APM agent's API to manually add the JavaScript snippet to your webpages, insert the instrumentation snippet as close to the top as possible. This allows you to take advantage of detailed information about browser's AJAX calls and JavaScript errors. For more information, see the instructions for your APM agent: C SDK Go Java .NET Node.js PHP Python Ruby Use REST API This information applies to apps that are also monitored by APM. The REST API lets you manage deployment outside the browser monitoring UI. This is useful for large organizations deploying multiple apps. Browser agent types: Lite, Pro, Pro+SPA We have three types of browser agents: Lite, Pro, and Pro+SPA. The agent type has no impact on your billing. Browser agent type Comparison Pro+SPA This is the default installed agent when you enable browser monitoring. What it includes: Gives you access to all of the Browser Pro features and to Single Page App (SPA) monitoring. Provides detailed page timing data and the most up-to-date New Relic features, including distributed tracing, for all types of applications. Pro+SPA is not limited only to single page applications. After install, you can downgrade anytime to the less advanced agents if you don't want or need SPA monitoring. Pro What it includes: Gives you access to the Browser Pro features. What it doesn't include: Lacks the functionality designed for single page app monitoring. Lite What it includes: Gives you information about some basic page load timing and browser user information. What it doesn't include: Lacks the Browser Pro features and SPA features. Details about how agent types relate to pricing: New Relic One pricing: This pricing model has data ingest as a billing factor. If you want to reduce data ingest, you may want to consider downgrading to lesser agent types after install. Original pricing: Your access to browser monitoring features is gated by your subscription plan, not by the agent type. This means there is no reason not to use the default Pro+SPA agent. After initial agent installation is finished, you can go to the App settings page to edit your configuration or to change your subscription.",

      "body": "New Relic's .Net Agent collects metrics from the .Net runtime about the performance of your application. These metrics can provide insight into how much CPU and memory an application consumes as well as how the performance of an application may be impacted by garbage collection and thread pool resource contention. The full suite of .Net Performance Metrics is available .Net Agent versions 8.20 and higher. To view these metrics, create a custom dashboard. Alternatively, you may use the Metric explorer under one.newrelic.com > APM > (select an app) > More views. CPU Metrics The following CPU Metrics are collected: CPU/User/Utilization The percentage of CPU that is consumed by this process. CPU/User Time The amount of time the process has spent executing application code. Memory Metrics The following Memory Metrics are collected: Memory/Physical The amount of private (physical) memory, in MB, allocated to the process. Memory/WorkingSet Amount of physical memory allocated to the process. Garbage Collection Metrics The .Net Garbage collector runs in the background and is responsible for identifying and reclaiming memory tied to objects that are no longer referenced by an application. The following metrics may be useful in identifying patterns of object allocation and potential over-allocation scenarios. This article further explains the fundamentals of garbage collection in .Net. Tip Garbage collection metrics are available for: All versions of the .Net Framework .Net Core 3.0 and above. Important For .Net Framework applications, the Windows User under which your application runs must have access to windows performance counter data. Usually this is accomplished by adding the user to \"Performance Monitor Users\" and \"Performance Log Users\" groups. Insufficient permissions will result in the agent not collecting garbage collection metrics. Overall Metrics Additionally, the following Garbage collection metrics are collected: GC/Handles The number of references to objects. GC/Induced Normally, the runtime performs garbage collection automatically. This metric identifies the number of times that Garbage Collection was manually invoked by an explicit call to GC.Collect from within application code. GC/PercentTimeInGC (.Net Framework only) The percentage of elapsed time that the .Net runtime has spent performing garbage collection since the last garbage collection cycle. Generation - 0 Heap The following GC Gen0 metrics are collected: GC/Gen0/Size The amount of memory (in MB) that is available to be allocated in Generation 0. This does not indicate the amount of memory that is being used by Generation 0, but the maximum available to be allocated. GC/Gen0/Promoted The amount of memory (in MB) that has survived garbage collection and has been promoted from Gen0 to Gen1. Memory survives garbage collection when there is an active reference to it. GC/Gen0/Collections The number of times Generation 0 Garbage Collection was executed by the garbage collector. Generation - 1 Heap The following GC Gen1 metrics are collected: GC/Gen1/Size The amount of memory (in MB) that is used in the Generation 1 heap. This differs from Gen0/Size which measure the maximum amount of memory available for the generation 0 heap. GC/Gen1/Promoted The amount of memory (in MB) that has survived garbage collection and has been promoted from Gen1 to Gen2. Memory survives garbage collection when there is an active reference to it. GC/Gen1/Collections The number of times Generation 1 Garbage Collection was executed by the garbage collector. Generation - 2 Heap The following GC Gen2 metrics are collected: GC/Gen2/Size The amount of memory (in MB) that is being used by the Gen2 Heap. GC/Gen2/Survived (.Net Core Only) The amount of memory (in MB) that has survived garbage collection. Memory survives garbage collection when there is an active reference to it. Unlike Gen0 and Gen1, memory that survives garbage collection is not promoted. GC/Gen2/Collections The number of times Generation 2 Garbage Collection was executed by the garbage collector. Large Object Heap (LOH) The following GC LOH metrics are collected: GC/LOH/Size The amount of memory (in MB) that is being used by the Large Object Heap (LOH). In .Net Core, the Large Object Heap is sometimes referred to as Gen3. GC/LOH/Survived (.Net Core Only) The amount of memory (in MB) that has survived garbage collection. Memory survives garbage collection when there is an active reference to it. Unlike Gen0 and Gen1, memory that survives garbage collection is not promoted. Managed Thread Pool Metrics The .Net runtime manages a pool of threads. The following metrics provide visibility into the performance of an application in terms of the thread pool and may help identify areas of thread pool starvation. Thread pool starvation/contention occurs when there are not enough threads available to process the requests made by an application. The following article describes the various features of the managed thread pool. Please note that these metrics do not include information about threads that are not managed by the thread pool. Worker Threads Worker threads are CPU-bound threads that are employed to perform work on behalf of a process. Threadpool/Worker/Available Identifies the number of managed threads available to the process. Consistently low numbers indicate a potential starvation scenario. Threadpool/Worker/InUse Identifies the number of worker threads that are currently in use by the process. Completion Threads Completion threads, sometimes referred to as I/O threads, are employed to monitor the completion of I/O operations. Threadpool/Completion/Available This metric identifies the number of threads that are currently available to the process. Consistently low numbers indicate a potential starvation scenario. Threadpool/Completion/InUse This metric identifies the number of completion threads currently in use by the process. Throughput Throughput metrics measure how much work has been requested to be performed on a different thread, the amount of work that has been started, and how much work is waiting for a thread pool resource to become available. Threadpool/Throughput/Requested Identifies the number of times that work has been requested to be run on a different thread pool managed thread. Threadpool/Throughput/Started Identifies the number of work items requested to be run on a separate thread that have started execution. Threadpool/Throughput/QueueLength Identifies the number of work items that have been requested, but are waiting to start. Numbers that consistently increase indicate a potential thread pool starvation situation. The following article describes how to modify the number of threads that are available to an application.",

      "body": "Browser monitoring's JavaScript snippet introduces a nearly invisible impact on website performance and user perception of the time it takes a page to load. The JavaScript is included in a packet of webpage data that is sent anyway. In addition, it immediately begins monitoring for errors and events as the rest of the webpage executes. The negligible amount of overhead required to load the JavaScript results in a significant return of actionable data. Overall impact The JavaScript's overhead takes into consideration both the impact on the user and the impact on your systems' performance: User perception: Typically users cannot detect performance degradations on a website of less than 200ms. Browser's JavaScript adds less than 15ms in aggregated time per page load. This is split up over time, so at no point would a user be able to perceive any performance impact due to the JavaScript. Webserver and systems: Browser app monitoring occurs on the user's browser, not on the server. Processing time does not have an impact on your CPU consumption. In addition, we take additional steps to minimize any potential impact on the apps and webpages being monitored. For example, the \"loader\" script is loaded synchronously in the <HEAD> in order to ensure monitoring is enabled for the entire life cycle of the page. This script is included inline, which eliminates the need for another roundtrip network request to a content delivery network (CDN). The \"loader\" comes with the initial page load. Later in the life cycle of the page, New Relic loads an additional monitoring script asynchronously. This script should not have any perceivable effect to the user and is included in the overall overhead of less than 15ms per page. Network impact Browser monitoring also minimizes network traffic for the end user by aggregating data locally (in the client) and sending it back to New Relic on load, at periodic intervals, on unload, or when data has been collected. (During the browser session's idle periods, transmissions may not be required.) Browser agent scripts The agent consists of two scripts. The first script is inserted inline into the HTML document. The second script is downloaded from the content delivery network (js-agent.newrelic.com) when the window load event happens. Find out about browser agent types here. Script Lite Pro Pro + SPA Inline script size 8.3 KB 22 KB 27 KB Downloaded script size 27 KB 27 KB 38 KB Browser agent harvests Data type Lite Pro Pro + SPA Harvest frequency Page view metrics/events yes yes yes One call. Once the second script is downloaded, we immediately make the first harvest call, which generates page view metrics and the PageView event. This is a JSONP call to bam.nr-data.net or bam-cell.nr-data.net. PageViewTiming events yes yes yes All agent types collect PageViewTiming events. The first harvest happens 10 seconds after the agent initializes, after window load event. After that, we send additional PageViewTiming events every 30 seconds, but only if there's data to send. For information about the event types included in these harvest calls, see the PageViewTiming section of our data dictionary. JavaScriptError metrics/events no yes yes First call when agent initializes; every 60 seconds after that. These calls, sent as metrics data, happen every 60 seconds because we include the Ajax calls that the agent itself makes. This information also applies to Ajax metrics. Ajax metrics no yes yes Sent together with JavaScript errors. Ajax events no yes yes Sent together with BrowserInteraction events. These are collected immediately when an interaction finishes. We only collect interactions for the initial page load and for route changes. We also have an API for generating custom interactions. There will be a separate call for each interaction. Typically, these calls are infrequent because they depend on the user interacting with the page. This information also applies to BrowserInteraction events. Session traces no yes yes First call when agent initializes; after that, every 10 seconds if there is data to send. Session traces send the most data, but they are heavily sampled. Only about 75 page views per hour get enabled to send session trace data. The agent sends data every 10 seconds if it has enough data to send. PageAction events no yes yes First call is made when agent initializes; after that, every 30 seconds if there is data to send. BrowserInteraction events no no yes Sent immediately when an interaction finishes. There will always be at least one interaction that represents the initial page load. Additional interactions are collected only if the URL changes (representing route change). Harvest frequency details for Ajax events apply here as well.",

      "body": "Your end-user experience depends on your entire technology stack. You need to quickly understand what's causing a customer complaint or issue. Did the problem come from your infrastructure, your application, or the browsers that ultimately render it? Is it the result of a problematic internet provider, a problem in your own data center with failing CPU or memory, or something else? Tip This doc gives you detailed information about why our browser monitoring solution matters to your business. But if you want to skip ahead, just sign up for a New Relic account. (It's free, forever!) Then, after you install the browser monitoring agent, you can start working with your data. More than Real User Monitoring (RUM) Many websites contain dynamic content that is loaded after the initial page has finished loading, and complex JavaScript code increases the need for error reporting. Browser monitoring in New Relic One provides a Real User Monitoring (RUM) solution that measures the speed and performance of your end users as they navigate to your site from different web browsers, devices, operating systems, and networks. With browser monitoring in New Relic One, you see actionable data about your end users' experience with your app. But browser monitoring in New Relic goes far beyond the initial page load to measure full page life cycle data. For example, our browser UI shows you: Actual performance data, such as by page view popularity and user satisfaction (Apdex) scores Perceived performance data that measures how quickly your async or dynamic visuals and interactive page contents display JavaScript error analytics, stack traces, and line-of-code visibility, to show you the end-user steps leading up to an error itself Session performance with a detailed timeline and heat map of the load and interaction events during a webpage's full life cycle AJAX requests indicating problems with timing, end points, and specific locations in the webpage Hash-based route changes in apps with single-page application (SPA) architectures These tools (and more!) help your teams optimize your end users' page load experience, eliminate bugs, and troubleshoot faster across your full stack. Examine user perceptions Real user data gives insights into actual page performance, but you also need to look into your users' perception of your site's performance. Pages can load content in many different ways, and users control when they interact with that content. This is why some user-centric performance metrics happen outside the standard window onload (page load time) in the browser monitoring agent. The PageViewTiming event provides a more real-time delivery mechanism that does not have a dependency on any other event. Additional metrics include: First paint, first contentful paint, and largest contentful paint First input delay First interaction This helps you understand how users experience your site, both from visual and responsiveness standpoints. Improve interactive app performance Our single-page app (SPA) monitoring automatically tracks route changes, initial page loads, and synchronous and asynchronous activity during browser interactions. You can also use our browser agent and SPA API to monitor virtually anything that executes inside the browser. If you are a developer, SPA monitoring can help you: Create faster, more responsive, highly interactive apps. Monitor the throughput and performance that real users are experiencing. Troubleshoot and resolve problems within the context of the page load. Query and visualize the data to assist with business decisions. Bring better apps to the marketplace more quickly. Correlate front-end and back-end problems With New Relic One, you can instrument any type of data you need, such as metrics, events, logs, and traces. This helps you find actionable data about your end users' experience across the stack. For example: Type of data Comments Locations or domains Limit browser monitoring to focus on specific geographical locations or specific types of end-user activity. You can also monitor or block specific domains. Trends in interactions Use our comparative charting feature for a direct page load time comparison between real user (browser) interactions and trends appearing in Synthetic monitors. Distributed tracing Isolate latency from the web browser through back-end services with distributed tracing. The UI helps you see the connection across across a full transaction, from browser activity, to time spent in network, to back-end activity. Browser types Explore your end users' experience with your app segmented by any types of browsers they use, including: Top browsers by throughput Average page load time by platform type (mobile, desktop, and other) Selected browser type by version (for example, Chrome 31, 32, 33, etc.) This helps you quickly determine whether problems with page load timing may be related to a specific browser type or platform, or whether the problem is more widespread. Get started with browser monitoring Follow these basic steps, and you'll quickly be up and running in New Relic with browser monitoring! Review the compatibility details and basic requirements for browser monitoring. Install the browser agent. Go to [one.newrelic.com > Explorer > Browser applications. Use the Explorer to access all your entities, that is, anything we can identify that reports data, from applications and hosts to custom groupings of any elements. View summary data from your Browser summary page, then drill down into page load timing details and other UI data. Configure your alerts for key performance data, or use our Applied Intelligence solutions to reduce alert noise, correlate incidents, and automatically detect anomalies. Query and visualize your default data (or customize your own), then analyze what that data says about your business. Customize and share your own charts and dashboards.",

      "body": "Browser monitoring supports the uploading of source maps. Source maps support is primarily useful for \"decoding\" minified JavaScript. Minified JavaScript results in mostly useless error stack traces on browser's JS errors page. Uploading source maps converts these errors to understandable stack traces, with useful references to code lines. This feature might also be useful for bundled or transpiled JavaScript code. Browser gives you two options for using source maps: Upload source maps via the browser UI Publish source maps to browser via the API This document will explain the first method: how to upload source maps via the UI, along with general troubleshooting help. For instructions on using the API method, see Push source maps via the API. Import source maps via the New Relic UI You can drag and drop, or upload, a source map file into the browser UI to associate it with a specific JavaScript file. New Relic will then convert minified stack traces into un-minified traces and source code visible on the JS errors page. To drag in or upload a source map to browser, the source map must be on your local machine. To associate a source map with an error stack trace on the JS errors page: Go to one.newrelic.com > Browser > (select an app) > JS Errors, then select a JS error group. (Don't select an Errors without a stack trace group.) From the selected JS error group, select the error instance details tab (next to the Summary tab). Error groupings will have one or more frames listed that reference JavaScript files. Select the + icon on the right side of a frame to expand it. Then drag the matching source map file into the frame. Alternative option: when the frame is expanded, select find file to upload the file manually. Tip An error frame with a gray strip on the left side indicate minified JS; a blue strip indicates it has had a source map applied. Other JS error frame features include: If you want to... Do this... See more of the surrounding code Select Show 10 more lines above/below to view the code before or after the code in the stack trace. See original, minified file information For individual frame info: Next to the frame's source line and column, mouse over the ellipsis. For raw data of the entire stack trace: At the top of the error tab, select < /> Raw. Remove a source map From an expanded stack trace frame, select Remove file. Troubleshooting Stack traces are still minified If you have uploaded source maps to New Relic and still see minified stack traces, there are a few things to check. Using the API is the best way to investigate potential issues, by listing or deleting published source maps. Typical problems Troubleshooting tips URL mismatch Each frame in the stack trace is associated with a specific JavaScript URL. That URL must match the JavaScript URL that was used when publishing the source map. Ensure that these URLs match exactly. Release name/ID mismatch If the JavaScript URL is not versioned when you deploy your front end assets, a release name and release ID must be specified using the newrelic.addRelease API method, and also when publishing your source maps. Ensure that these strings match exactly. 409 error: Combination of javascriptUrl, releaseName, and releaseId must be unique If a source map file for a particular JavaScript URL is uploaded without a release name or ID specified, New Relic treats the URL as a unique identifier. To resolve this, delete the source map that has NULL release name and ID values and re-upload all versions for that URL including those parameters. This will allow multiple versions of source maps for a particular JS URL. Missing SourcesContent component Your mapping file must contain the SourcesContent component for New Relic to un-minify your stack traces. If you have uploaded your map successfully and are still not seeing un-minified code, check the original source map for this component. If you can't find it, regenerate the source map so the component is included, and upload your map to New Relic. If the SourcesContent component is not added, an error similar to Whoops, that was the wrong file. Please try again. will appear. Can't generate source maps Having trouble even generating source maps? Every build system has its own instructions for generating source maps. For more specific details, please see the documentation for your particular tool. Below are source map generation instructions for two popular build systems: Generate source maps with UglifyJS Generate source maps using UglifyJS: When \"uglifying\" source files, specify a source map file name and include the original source content: Starting on version v3.12.5: uglifyjs [source files] \\ -o bundle.min.js \\ -c -m --source-map \"includeSources=true\" Copy For older versions: uglifyjs [source files] \\ -o bundle.min.js \\ --source-map bundle.min.js.map \\ --source-map-include-sources \\ -c -m Copy Generate source maps with webpack Generate source maps using Webpack: In your production webpack config, simply specify source-map for the config.devtool property. The sourceMapFilename property of config.output is optional and defaults to [name].js.map. devtool: 'source-map', output: { path: path.join(__dirname, 'dist'), filename: '[name].js', sourceMapFilename: '[name].js.map', }, Copy",

      "body": "By default, mobile monitoring enables crash reporting for your mobile applications to help track and diagnose crashes. When an Android application crashes, the agent uploads a crash report to the New Relic collector. The crash details will then be processed and de-obfuscated automatically if you are using ProGuard or DexGuard. You can view detailed information about crashes in the Crash analysis UI, or receive crash notifications by email. You can also explore the crash data deeper with New Relic Insights, or integrate with ticketing systems for further investigation. Upload the ProGuard or DexGuard file The Android agent supports ProGuard and DexGuard. DexGuard is an extension to ProGuard, and it behaves the same as ProGuard when dealing with crash symbolication and obfuscated code maps. ProGuard obfuscates your code by renaming classes, fields, and methods with semantically obscure labels. DexGuard adds another additional layer of obfuscation and security, but otherwise behaves identically to ProGuard. If ProGuard or DexGuard is enabled, the stack trace produced by a crash consists only of these obfuscated labels, which are not human-readable. Follow the SDK installation or upgrade instructions to configure ProGuard or DexGuard and enable crash reporting. Be sure to create the newrelic.properties file containing your application token. Use mapping.txt file The agent uses the mapping.txt file produced during a ProGuard/DexGuard-enabled build. This file consists of the obfuscated label names, and provides reverse mapping between obfuscated and plain text labels. You must use the copy of mapping.txt generated during the build that produced your final application. The application's build ID changes each time an APK is generated, and the build ID in the mapping file must match the ID contained in each uploaded crash report. After you create a newrelic.properties file containing your New Relic app token in your project, the ProGuard or DexGuard mapping.txt file will be uploaded automatically after each build. Exception If either of the following situations occur, you must manually upload the mapping.txt replacement file: If the mapping.txt file is renamed using the DexGuard -printmapping option, the Android agent will be unable to locate or upload the stripped names. If you see obfuscated crash reports in the Crashes page, you may not have a mapping.txt file uploaded. Map Processing Important Agent version 5.27.0 introduces changes to the way the agent plugin process maps during builds. Maps are reported for select variant builds The agent will tag and report only those mapping.txt files generated by Release build-type variants. This behavior can be configured or disabled through the New Relic Gradle Plugin extension. Variants are assigned unique build IDs During an execution of a Gradle build, a single unique ID (build ID) was generated to represent all variants of the app built during that invocation. This often led to mismatched crash reports for customers using variants to customize a common app code base. Each variant is now identified by its own unique ID, which is used when reporting the variant's ProGuard map to New Relic. You can disable this behavior through the New Relic Gradle Plugin extension. Compress maps prior to upload As apps get larger, so do their associated maps, which then results in longer upload times when reporting the map. If map reporting time is unreasonably long, the agent can compress the map prior to transfer. To enable compressed map uploads, add the following to your app's newrelic.properties file: com.newrelic.compressed_uploads=true Copy Deferred crash reporting Important Agent version 6.0.0 introduces changes to the way the agent plugin processes crashes at runtime. In an attempt to address crash report duplication, deferred crash reporting is now the default crash reporting behavior. In this case, crash reports are recorded when they occur, but they're not uploaded until the next application launch. The previous crash reporting behavior is still available: uploading the crash as soon as it occurs before the application process terminates. You can use the NewRelic.withCrashReportingEnabled(boolean) API method. For example: NewRelic .withApplicationToken(\"<appToken>\") .withCrashReportingEnabled(true) .start(this.getApplication()); Copy Disable crash reporting If you want to use another crash reporting tool, you can disable crash reporting by calling NewRelic.disableFeature(FeatureFlag.CrashReporting) prior to agent initialization. For example: NewRelic.disableFeature(FeatureFlag.CrashReporting); NewRelic .withApplicationToken(\"<appToken>\") .start(this.getApplication()); Copy Debug the crash reporter Crash reporting for Android is designed to work with other crash reporting frameworks by chaining the uncaught exception handler if it is already registered. If no other framework has been found (or if New Relic is the first framework registered), the debug logs will include: Installing New Relic crash handler. Copy If another handler is already registered, debug logs will include: Installing New Relic crash handler and chaining previous exception handler. Copy Every time New Relic catches an exception, it is logged to DEBUG level. For example: A crash has been detected in <className>. Copy If New Relic catches an exception but crash reporting has been disabled for any reason, this message is logged: A crash has been detected but crash reporting is disabled. Copy If you don't see crash reports, check the debug logs for messages like this. Manually upload a ProGuard or DexGuard map file In some unusual circumstances, it may not be possible to automatically upload the ProGuard or DexGuard mapping file. This is often due to incorrectly creating a newrelic.properties file containing your application token. This will result in build errors or warnings with detailed log messages. To manually upload a ProGuard or DexGuard map file: Find the mapping.txt file(s) in the project's build directory For example, the file is located in the <PROJECT_ROOT>/app/build/outputs/mapping/<BUILD_VARIANT> directory for projects that use Android Studio. Generally, a release variant is used when building the final version of the application. The following command is useful for finding map files: find <project_root> -name mapping.txt Copy Using a command terminal, upload the ProGuard or DexGuard mapping file: For a US account: curl -v -F upload=@\"<mapping.txt>\" -H \"X-APP-LICENSE-KEY:<APPLICATION_TOKEN>\" https://mobile-symbol-upload.newrelic.com/symbol Copy For a EU account: curl -v -F upload=@\"<mapping.txt>\" -H \"X-APP-LICENSE-KEY:<APPLICATION_TOKEN>\" https://mobile-symbol-upload.eu.newrelic.com/symbol Copy Replace the following in your command: <mapping.txt> is the full path to the ProGuard or DexGuard mapping.txt file. <APPLICATION_TOKEN> is your mobile monitoring application token.",

If you're trying to switch between accounts, use the account switcher. account switcher If you have access to more than one account in a multi-account organization, you can use the account switcher to switch between accounts. This is located in the top right of most New Relic UI pages. For more on factors that affect access to accounts, see Factors affecting access. To find account settings, use the account dropdown. administrator A type of user role on a New Relic account. For more information, see Users. agent At New Relic, an agent is a piece of monitoring software that provides integrations with various technologies (for example, web frameworks, host operating systems, or database types). The agents send that data to New Relic, usually on a specific cadence. For more information, see: New Relic Instant Observability Install agents agent API Some New Relic agents have agent APIs that allow you to extend the functionality of an agent. You can use the API to control, customize and extend the functionality of the agent. Here are some agent API docs: APM agents: C SDK API Go agent API Java agent API .NET agent API Node.js agent API PHP agent API Ruby agent API Python agent API Browser agent: Browser agent API Mobile agents: iOS SDK API Android SDK API aggregated metrics Aggregated metric data summarizes calls to specific methods in your application, including how many times each one was called and response times. In the New Relic UI, you see the class and method names along with their aggregate numbers. Metric data aggregation depends on the New Relic tool and your subscription level. For more information, see the documentation about data retention. aggregation delay The length of time in seconds to wait for the aggregation window to fill with data. Required when using CADENCE or EVENT_FLOW aggreation_method types. aggregation function You can use NRQL query functions, such as sum(), average(), or latest() to choose how the data points in an aggregation window should be processed into a single data point. The single aggregated data point is what's passed through the alert evaluation process. aggregation method New Relic aggregates data into windows, and needs to determine when the current window ends and the next one begins. The aggregation_method is the logic that tells us when we have all the data for a given aggregation window. Once the window is closed, the data is aggregated into a single point and evaluated against the threshold. This field is optional. One of the following three values can be specified: EVENT_FLOW: (Default) Each aggregation window will wait until it starts to see timestamps arrive that are past its own delay setting. Once this occurs, the data is published. Relies on the timestamps of arriving data, so wall-clock time is no longer relevant. Works best for sources that come in frequently and with low event spread (high througput metrics) CADENCE: Classic New Relic logic where each evaluation window waits exactly as long as the aggregation_delay setting, using the wall-clock time as a timer. aggregation_delay is required when using this option. Data arriving too late will be dropped, which can cause false alerts. EVENT_TIMER: Each aggregation window has a timer on it, set to the aggregation_timer setting. The Timer starts running as soon as the first data point appears for that aggregation window (based on the data point’s timestamp). The aggregation_timer is reset for each new data point that arrives for that window. Once the aggregation_timer reaches 0, the aggregation window is published. Ideal for sparse and batched data, such as cloud integrations and infrequent error logs. aggregation timer The length of time in seconds to wait after each data point received, to ensure the entire batch is processed. Required when using EVENT_TIMER aggregation_method type. aggregation window Streaming alerts gathers data together into specific amounts of time. These windows of time are customizable. Data points are collected together based their timestamps and reported as a batch. The customizable aggregation window provides greater flexibility and fewer false violations when alerting on irregular or less frequent data points. alert An alert communicates an event or incident that designated personnel can track through Alerts. For an explanation of how basic alerts concepts are related, see Concepts and workflow. alert condition An alert condition (or condition), identified by its unique numeric condition_id, contains the criteria for creating a violation. The condition includes the threshold that is set for a metric timeslice or a custom metric over time on a chosen target. For an explanation of how a condition relates to other basic alerts concepts, see Concepts and workflow. alert evaluation Streaming data is assessed on a set of aggregation windows to determine if an alert condition is violating or recovering. The aggregation window time is how long we'll collect data before running the NRQL query condition. The offset evaluation time is how long you want us to wait for late data before assessing it. If a window doesn't have any data points, it's treated as a gap for loss of signal. alert policy A collection of one or more conditions, one or more notification channels, and an Incident preference setting. If a condition contained within the policy opens a violation, an incident may be opened depending on the Incident preference setting. Notifications will then be sent to all channels attached to the policy. For an explanation of how a policy relates to other basic alerts concepts, see Concepts and workflow. apdex Apdex is an industry-standard way to measure users' satisfaction with the response time of an application or service. New Relic rates each response as Satisfied, Tolerated, or Frustrated, and uses these ratings to calculate an overall user satisfaction score. For more information, see Apdex: Measure user satisfaction. apdex_f The response time above which a transaction are rated frustrating. Defaults to four times apdex_t. Requests that complete in less than apdex_t are rated satisfied. Requests that take longer than apdex_t, but less than four times apdex_t (apdex_f), are tolerated. Any requests that take longer than apdex_f are rated frustrating. For more information, see Apdex: Measure user satisfaction. apdex_t The response time above which a transaction is considered tolerable. The default value is 0.5 seconds, but you can change this in your Apdex settings. Requests that complete in less than apdex_t are rated satisfied. Requests that take more than apdex_t, but less than apdex_f, are tolerated. Any requests that take longer than apdex_f are rated frustrating. For more information, see Apdex: Measure user satisfaction. API (application programming interface) New Relic offers a variety of APIs and SDKs. For more information, see the introduction to New Relic's APIs. APM New Relic's APM (application performance monitoring) provides monitoring of your web or non-web application's performance. APM supports apps using several programming languages. application For New Relic purposes, any program instrumented by New Relic. application ID Some New Relic solutions assign a monitored application a unique application ID, often shortened to app ID. When present, this ID is available in the UI. It is also reported as an attribute and can be queried. For how to determine this, see Find app ID. application name The name that New Relic combines with your license key to uniquely identify a particular app. For more information, see Name your application. Applied Intelligence (AI) Applied Intelligence (AI) helps you find, troubleshoot, and resolve problems more quickly. Specifically, it’s a hybrid machine learning engine that reduces alert noise, correlates incidents, and automatically detects anomalies. Applied Intelligence includes Alerts, Incident Intelligence, and Proactive Detection. attribute Attributes are key-value pairs attached to data objects reported to New Relic. Attributes add detail, and they're similar to tags or labels in other SaaS software. You can explore this data by querying or searching via the UI or by using the data dictionary. Examples: APM reports a Transaction event. This includes timing data for the transaction in a duration attribute, which might have a value of .002. Our Infrastructure Monitoring reports a ProcessSample event. This includes a variety of CPU usage attributes, including a cpuSystemPercent attribute, which might have a value of .01. Our Telemetry SDK reports a Metric data type for storing metrics, with attached attributes like metricName and newrelic.source. Some New Relic tools allow you to report custom attributes to enhance your monitoring. For more information about attributes in APM, see Agent attributes. availability monitoring See Types of Synthetics monitors. browser The New Relic UI supports most browsers. For more information, see Supported browsers. For our end-user browser monitoring tool, see Browser Monitoring. Browser monitoring A Real User Monitoring (RUM) solution that measures the speed and performance of your end users as they navigate to your site from different web browsers, devices, operating systems, and networks. background external See web external. child account See parent account. cloud-based integration New Relic offers cloud-based integrations with providers such as Amazon Web Services (AWS), Microsoft Azure, and Google Cloud Platform. collector The component that collects data from New Relic agents running on an app server, mobile device, or end-user browser. While the agent is installed on a user's app server, the collectors are centrally located in New Relic's data center. In order to contact the collector, the agent must be able to reach New Relic's domains and IP addresses. (The exact domain or IP depends on the New Relic monitoring tool.) The collector receives and interprets this data, and stores it in a database. The data is then retrieved and presented in the New Relic UI and by our various REST APIs. Command line interface (CLI) Our command line interface (CLI) is a tool you can use to build a New Relic application. This is the same tool our own engineers use. Go here for quick start instructions. Go to our Developer site for sample apps and guides. compute unit (CU) A unit of measurement that determines your pricing for some New Relic products governed by our original product-based pricing model. For more information, see Compute unit pricing. condition_id See alert condition. CPM (calls per minute) The number of calls your application receives each minute. This usually corresponds to the number of page views or external connections, and is usually the same as RPM (requests per minute). CPU burn The time consumed by code minus the wait time for a transaction. This is the time actually spent processing the transaction. It appears in the New Relic UI at the top of the transaction view for the agents that provide it (Ruby and PHP only). custom attribute A key-value pair added to a transaction or event in order to gain additional information about it. For more information, see custom attributes. custom dashboard A customizable dashboard with charts and tables that includes data from multiple New Relic data sources. For more information, see dashboards. custom event An event, in New Relic terms, is a data object with attached attributes. New Relic reports default event types, like Transaction and TransactionError. You can also create your own events. Events can be queried, and are used in some other features. You can generate custom events with APM agents, the browser monitoring agent, the mobile monitoring agents, and via the Event API. Alternatively, you can add custom attributes to some existing default New Relic events. custom instrumentation Custom instrumentation allows you to extend New Relic's monitoring to instrument code elements New Relic doesn't automatically instrument. Custom instrumentation is useful when your framework is not supported by New Relic, or when New Relic fails to pick up some element of your program. You can also use custom instrumentation to block a transaction from being reported entirely. For more information, see Custom instrumentation. custom metric Metric timeslice data that is manually recorded via an API call. Custom metrics allow you to record arbitrary metrics; for example, timing or computer resource data. All custom metric names must be prefixed with Custom/. For more information, see Custom metrics. Not to be confused with custom instrumentation data. data collector See collector. data explorer Use the data explorer to access, query and customize your data, create visualizations, and make connections between your services in a consistent and curated experience. For more on using the data explorer, see Introduction to the data explorer. degradation period When a data source enters a violating state, a degradation period of time begins. The degradation period is set in the condition's threshold. A violation will open if the source stays in a violating state for the entire degradation period. In addition: If the data source enters a non-violating state before the entire time has elapsed, the degradation period countdown is reset, and a violation does not open. If your alert condition threshold is configured as at least once in, the degradation period always lasts a single minute. dimensional metric A dimensional metric is a metric that has multiple attributes, also known as dimensions. At New Relic, we report dimensional metrics using the Metric data type. For more on other metric data types, see Metric data. Docker An open platform for distributed applications, which allows you to assemble multi-container portable apps. Infrastructure Monitoring includes integrated Docker monitoring. For more information about Docker, see the Docker website. downtime The period of time when customers cannot access your site and your app is not reporting to New Relic. For more information, see Synthetic Monitoring and Types of synthetic monitors. entity In New Relic, an entity is anything we can identify that has data you can monitor. An entity can be something you monitor directly, like applications and microservices, or indirectly, like data centers. You can identify one or more entities to be targets for alert conditions. In the Alerts API, the entity being monitored is identified with an entity_id. For more on this, see What are entities? event The word event is a general term that can have many meanings. At New Relic, event can have several meanings: At New Relic, event data is one of our core data types. Event data represents a record of a single event at a particular moment in time. Events can vary by type (for example, Transaction or Mobile, and will have associated attributes (for example, timestamp or transactionName). For more details, see Event data. For our infrastructure monitoring, the word event can be used to refer to important system and host activity. For example, a configuration change for a monitored host would be registered on Infrastructure's Events UI page. For alerts, the Events UI page displays a list of alerts-related incidents for your monitored entities. Events are reported for a violation opening and for closing. In some contexts, event can refer to any NRQL-queryable data type. For example, when you run a NRQL query, you will see a count of inspected events: this refers to a count of all data types queried. expected error An expected error is a common error that you don't want to affect your Apdex score or error rate. For more information, see Manage errors in APM. exporter At New Relic, an exporter is a type of integration that reports telemetry data to New Relic from a third-party (non-New Relic) telemetry tool. For examples, see Exporters, or search our integration quickstarts in New Relic I/O. Flex New Relic Flex is an application-agnostic, all-in-one infrastructure integration. With it, you can build your own integration that collects metric data from a wide variety of services, and that can instrument any app that exposes metrics over a standard protocol (HTTP, file, shell) in a standard format (for example, JSON or plain text) to the terminal. It's a recommended way to create a custom integration, because it doesn't require coding skills. framework A framework is a structured collection of pre-defined functions, into which an application builder inserts their own code to build their application. A framework is not the same as a library. While a library is a collection of functions you can call as needed, a framework is a skeleton for your application. The functions in that framework then call your functions. For more about the distinction between a framework and a library, see What is the difference between a framework and a library?. New Relic automatically instruments many common frameworks. For more about the frameworks New Relic supports, see the agent-specific documentation: C SDK supported frameworks Go supported frameworks Java supported frameworks .NET supported frameworks Node.js supported frameworks PHP supported frameworks Python supported frameworks Ruby supported frameworks harvest cycle The period of time between each connection from a New Relic agent to the collector. Between harvest cycles, an agent collects and caches data. At the end of the cycle an agent reports those data to the collector, then begins a new harvest cycle. health status indicator Some New Relic UI pages have a health status indicator appearing next to an index of monitored entities. This is a colored bar (generally green, yellow, red, or gray) indicating the status of your app or other entity monitored by New Relic. It also indicates whether the entity has any alert policies assigned to it and whether there are any policy violations. In general, the colored bar will be green, yellow, red, or gray to indicate the health status. Exceptions: Our REST API (v2) uses orange instead of yellow for the application's health and reporting status. Service maps use different criteria for reporting the health of a connection between an app and an external service not monitored by New Relic (for example, a third party API). host At New Relic, a host means one of the following: A physical machine is a hardware-based device with dedicated physical resources, including memory, processing, and storage. Each machine has its own OS which applications run on. A virtual machine (VM) is the software implementation of a physical machine that executes programs like a physical machine. One or more virtual machines can run on a physical machine. Each virtual machine has its own OS and allocated virtual machine resources such as RAM and CPU. A cloud instance is a type of virtual machine that is run in the public cloud. In this context, virtual machines and cloud instances are different from Java Virtual Machines (JVMs) and containers. host ID Each host identified by APM is assigned a host ID. This ID is used to uniquely identify it, and to retrieve data about that host via the REST API. For more information, see List host ID. ignored error An error that you have told the APM agent not to report to the collector. For more information, see Manage errors in APM. incident An incident is a collection of one or more violations of the conditions defined in an alert policy. An incident record includes all of the open and close time stamps for each violation, as well as chart snapshots of the data being evaluated around the time of each violation. You can view detailed information from the Incidents pages in the user interface. You can also select your preference for how we roll up violations into the incident. For an explanation of how an incident relates to other basic alerts concepts, see Concepts and workflow. Infrastructure monitoring By connecting changes in host performance to changes in your configuration, infrastructure monitoring provides real-time metrics and powerful analytics that reduce your mean-time-to-resolution (MTTR). Infrastructure is specifically designed for complex environments that need flexible, dynamic server monitoring, from a physical datacenter to thousands of Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) instances and other types of integrations. Insights Insights was the name for the New Relic product that previously governed the reporting of custom events, as well as the ability to query and chart your New Relic data. These features are now a fundamental part of the New Relic One platform and are no longer governed by the Insights product or name. To learn more about these features: Event API for reporting custom events Query and chart data For historical reasons, the word \"Insights\" is still used in some places. For example: Some APM agents still have Insights language in their codebase. For example, the Java agent custom_insights_events configuration. For New Relic organizations on our original pricing model, Insights Pro is still the product name governing custom event data ingest and retention. There is an API key called the Insights insert key. instance ID Each instance identified by New Relic is assigned a unique instance ID. Instance IDs are most commonly found for JVMs (Java Virtual Machines), but can exist for each agent. This ID is used to uniquely identify it, and to retrieve data about that instance via the REST API. For more information, see List instance IDs. instrumentation The collection of data from an application or host. When New Relic instruments a framework, it detects the methods and calls used by that framework, and intelligently groups them together. integration At New Relic, an integration refers to a solution that integrates with a specific technology (like a web framework or a type of database). All our integrations can be found as quickstarts in New Relic Instant Observability. interaction In our mobile monitoring, an interaction is a specific code path initiated by a user interaction (usually a button press). An interaction is the mobile equivalent of a transaction, and like a transaction an interaction can be traced and monitored. You can see much of the data included in an interaction in the BrowserInteraction event. interaction trace An interaction trace is a complete picture of a single interaction. With interaction traces, New Relic gives you much deeper visibility into a single slow interaction, which can help you understand a broader problem. Interaction traces are the mobile equivalent of a transaction trace. For more information, see Creating interactions (iOS) and Creating interactions (Android). inventory data Inventory data is information about the status or configuration of a service or host. Examples of inventory data include: Configuration settings Name of the host the service is on Amazon AWS region Port being used For more information, see Understand and use data. key transaction A web transaction that the user has marked as particularly important; for example, key business events (such as signups or purchase confirmations), or transactions with a high performance impact (such as searches). Key transactions have their own pages in the UI and other customized values. For more information, see Key transactions. launcher A launcher is a specific piece of code you can include when you create a New Relic One app. It creates the tile on the homepage that you click to launch the app. For more information, see the documentation about core UI components. log A log is a message about a system used to understand the activity of the system and to diagnose problems. For more information on how we use log data, see Log management. Log monitoring Our log management and monitoring features give you the tools to collect, process, explore, visualize, and alert on your log data using your existing log forwarder. With all of your log data in one place, you'll be able to make better decisions, detect and resolve problems more quickly, and see your logs in context to troubleshoot faster. Logs Our Logs feature is a scalable log management platform that allows you to connect your log data with the rest of your telemetry data. Pre-built plugins with some of the most common open-source logging tools make it simple to send your data from anywhere to New Relic. Logs in context Logs in context makes it easy to link to your log data with related data across the rest of our platform. Bringing all of this data together in a single tool allows you to quickly get to the root cause of an issue and find the log lines that you need to identify and resolve a problem. master account See parent account. metric A metric is a numeric measurement. Metric data is a broad category because there are several ways to make and report measurements. For more about how metrics are reported at New Relic, see New Relic data types. metric timeslice New Relic reports metrics in several ways. One variety of metric data is called metric timeslice data; this is the type of data used to generate many of the charts in APM, mobile monitoring, and browser monitoring (for more details, see metric timeslice data). Over time, metric timeslice data is aggregated into longer timeslice data records for more efficient storage. For more about how we aggregate this type of data, see Data aggregation. For how to query this type of data, see Query metric timeslice data. metric grouping issue A metric grouping issue occurs when an account sends too many differently named metric timeslice data points to New Relic, and those individual web transactions are not properly aggregated. For example, rather than a single /user/controlpanel/ metric name, you might see /user/controlpanel/alice, /user/controlpanel/bob, and /user/controlpanel/carol. For more information, see Metric grouping issues. minion The software that accepts monitor jobs from a private location. A minion is a packaged virtual appliance that runs in your hypervisor. For more information, see Private locations overview and install and configure private minions. Mobile monitoring Mobile monitoring allows you to monitor and manage the performance of your mobile apps on Android, iOS, tvOS, and other systems. Mobile monitoring provides end-to-end details, including crashes, throughput, HTTP requests, error traces, and more. Not to be confused with New Relic's own mobile apps for Android, iPhone, and iPad. monitor For our Synthetic Monitoring, a monitor ensures your website or API endpoint is available. For more information, see Adding and editing monitors. NerdGraph NerdGraph is our GraphQL API, an efficient and flexible query language that lets you request exactly the data you need, without over-fetching or under-fetching. NerdGraph calls get all the data you need in a single request. NerdGraph also makes it easier to evolve APIs over time and enables powerful developer tools. You can use our NerdGraph GraphiQL explorer to explore the schema and find definitions. With valid New Relic API key, you can try it out yourself at api.newrelic.com/graphiql. Nerdlet A Nerdlet is a component of a New Relic One application. It's a specific UI view, represented by a React JavaScript package. For more information, see Nerdpack file structure. Nerdpack A Nerdpack is a component of a New Relic One application. It's the package containing all the files needed by that application. For more information, see Nerdpack file structure. New Relic Edge with Infinite Tracing New Relic Edge with Infinite Tracing is a fully managed, distributed tracing service that observes 100% of your application traces, then provides actionable data so you can solve issues faster. For more information, see /docs/understand-dependencies/distributed-tracing/get-started/how-new-relic-distributed-tracing-works. New Relic One For more information, see Introduction to New Relic One. New Relic One catalog Our catalog is a collection of applications built on the New Relic One platform. The catalog includes custom apps we've built, public open source apps, and any apps that you buid. You can browse the catalog on New Relic One. NRQL (New Relic query language) NRQL is a query language, similar in form to SQL, that allows you to query the data stored in your New Relic account. non-web transaction APM identifies transactions as either web or non-web. When New Relic does not detect a transaction was initiated by a web request, this is called a non-web transaction. For more information, see Background processes and other non-web transactions. notification The message sent when an incident opens, is acknowledged, or closes. The type of notification is defined by the alert policy's notification channel. For an explanation of how notifications relate to other basic alerts concepts, see Concepts and workflow. notification channel Where we send a notification when an incident opens, is acknowledged, or closes. Available channels include email, mobile push notifications, webhooks, and more. on-host integration On-host integrations refer to integrations that reside on your own servers or hosts and that communicate with our infrastructure agent. For more information, see Introduction to on-host integrations. owner For accounts on our original pricing model, this is a type of user role: the user who initially created the account. For more information, see Users. page load timing With page load timing, New Relic monitors the full load time for end-user browsers. New Relic's application agents dynamically inject JavaScript into the page, then capture the following key load points: Navigation start: The user initiates the transaction. First byte: The browser receives the requested page. DOM ready: The browser has finished parsing DOM. Page ready: Page loading is complete. Page load timing is sometimes referred to as RUM, or real user monitoring. Unlike standard RUM, page load timing also captures JavaScript errors and AJAX requests. For more information, see Page load timing process. parameter Deprecated term; see attribute. parent account New Relic organizations can have a parent/child account structure. This structure was much more important for organizations on our original user model, but is still used for some features for organizations on the New Relic One user model. Learn more about account structure. Parent accounts were previously referred to as \"master accounts\", and child accounts were previously referred to as \"sub-accounts\". permalink A unique URL that links to a view of your application at a specific point in time. Permalinks are useful for troubleshooting and for sharing interesting time windows with colleagues. pinger The component of New Relic that connects to your website to verify your website is accessible. New Relic has pingers in Europe, Asia, and the United States. Each pinger attempts to contact your website at least once every two minutes. If enough pingers are unable to reach your website, your application will be considered down. For in-depth scriptable testing, including real browser tests and tests of API endpoints, see Synthetic Monitoring. Synthetic Monitoring includes free ping monitoring, which allows you to monitor your website from locations around the world. For more information, see Types of Synthetic monitors. polling interval (AWS) Our Amazon integrations query your AWS services according to a polling interval, which varies depending on the integration. Each polling interval occurs for every AWS entity. For example, if you have thirteen Elastic Load Balancers (ELB), each one will be polled every five minutes. Depending on the AWS integration, there may be delays in the timing between the API request and the metric data returned. If you notice unusual delays, follow the integration troubleshooting procedures. PPM (pages per minute) The number of pages per minute your application serves. private location A Synthetic monitor feature that allows you to run Synthetic monitors from within your own systems by creating private minions. Private locations allow you to extend your Synthetic coverage to new geographical locations, and to monitor websites behind your firewall such as an intranet site. For more information, see Private locations overview. recovery period A recovery period of time begins when a data source enters a non-violating state after being in a violating state. The recovery period is set in the condition's threshold. A violation will close when a source remains in a non-violating state and the recovery period time has elapsed. If the data source enters a violating state before the time has elapsed, the recovery period clock will reset and the violation won't close. response time The duration of time between a request for service and a response. For more information, see Response time. restricted user A type of user role on a New Relic account. For more information, see Users. rollup Using the same application name for multiple applications. This allows you to combine data in APM, either from multiple applications, or from multiple instances of an application. For more information, see Rolling up app data. root span For distributed tracing, the root span is the first span in a trace. In many cases, the root span duration will represent the duration of the entire trace, or be very close to it. However, for more complex, modern systems that use a lot of asynchronous, non-blocking processes, this will not be true. For those systems, the root span’s duration may be significantly less than the duration of the trace. RPM The term RPM usually refers to the number of requests per minute your application receives from users. This is usually the same as CPM (calls per minute). Historically, some New Relic monitoring solutions, like APM and Browser Monitoring, used to contain RPM in the URL; for example, https://rpm.newrelic.com. This language use originally referred to Rails performance management because the first iteration of our product monitored Ruby on Rails applications. We monitor many more languages and systems than Ruby now. RUM (real user monitoring) See page load timing. runbook A runbook contains standard procedures and operations typically used by system administrators, network operations staff, and other personnel to handle outages, alert incidents, and other situations. If your organization stores runbook instructions as URLs, you can link this information to an alerts policy so your personnel has easy access to this information when an incident violates the defined policy thresholds. SAML (Security Assertion Markup Language) SAML is an XML-based data format for sharing authentication data between two parties. New Relic accounts must obtain a SAML certificate in order to enable Single Sign On for their users. For more information, see SAML service providers. Selenium Selenium is an open-source browser testing suite. Synthetics uses Selenium to test monitored websites with real browsers. For more information, see monitor types. service A service is a cluster of runtime server processes that accomplish a particular task, usually service requests. Unlike an application, a service is not usually invoked by a human. New Relic offers a variety of integrations that allow you to report data from your services. signal The stream of telemetry data that's watched and alerted on. You use NRQL queries to define a signal. signal filter When we receive data and it's routed to the streaming alerts platform, your NRQL WHERE clause will filter the data coming in. The filtered streaming data is what's evaluated for loss of signal violations, for example. span In a distributed trace, a span is a \"named, timed operation representing a contiguous segment of work in that trace\" (from OpenTracing.io definition). For distributed tracing, spans are displayed in the distributed tracing UI, and the data type Span is available to be queried. See also root span. SSL certificate SSL certificates encrypt data that is being transmitted. While New Relic refers to security certificates as SSL because it is a more commonly used term, all certificates adhere to industry standards for secure encryption in transit. SSO (single sign on) SSO (single sign on) allows you to manage user authentication in New Relic using an external SSO provider. For more information, see Setting up SSO. streaming algorithm This is what determines when the data in an aggregation window is processed. The streaming algorithm uses your server's clock time and the aggregation window size to trigger the alert evaluation process. sub-accounts See master account. Synthetic monitoring Synthetic monitoring allows you to monitor your website or API endpoint via automated, scriptable tools. Use free ping monitor to ensure your website is accessible, or expand your monitoring with browser monitors, which test your website with real browsers. Go further with scripting, to script browsers or API monitors for sophisticated testing. target A target is a resource or component monitored by a New Relic monitoring tool that has been identified in an alert condition. When the data source for that target crosses the defined critical threshold, we will open a violation. Depending on your policy's Incident preference setting, Alerts may create an incident record and send notifications through the defined channels. See also entity. tag Tags are key:value metadata added to monitored apps, hosts, dashboards, and other entities to help you organize your data at a high level. For details, see Tags. thresholds Thresholds are alert condition settings that define a violation. Threshold values include the value a data source must pass to trigger a violation and the time-related settings that define a violation; for example: Passing a certain value for at least x minutes Passing a certain value only once in x minutes While the data source passes a certain value, a degradation period starts. Likewise, when that data source stops passing a certain value, a recovery period starts. The durations of these two time periods are defined in the alert condition threshold settings. Thresholds have a required critical (red) threshold and an optional warning (yellow) threshold. In the UI, the entity's health status indicator will change to yellow or red when a threshold has been crossed and a violation will open. For more information, see Define thresholds. For an explanation of how thresholds relate to other basic Alerts concepts, see Concepts and workflow. throughput Throughput is a measurement of user activity for a monitored application. APM throughput and Browser Monitoring throughput are measured in different ways: APM: requests per minute (RPM) Browser: page views per minute (PPM) tier A tier can refer to how New Relic categorizes or visualizes the various agent language ecosystems that we support. For example: In APM, the color-coded categories that appear on your app's main Overview chart show response time spent in various functions, processes, or agents as tiers; for example, request queuing, garbage collection, Middleware, JVMs, etc. In New Relic labels, TIER can be used to define or classify the client-server architecture; for example, front-end and back-end tiers. \"Tier\" may sometimes be used to refer to our pricing editions. time picker By default the New Relic UI shows data for the past 30 minutes, ending now. To change the time window, use the time picker. time range A time range can refer to a length of time selected in the New Relic UI. New Relic displays a time range depending on the range you select using the time picker. timeslice data See metric timeslice data. trace A trace is a description of how a request travels through a system. Trace data helps you understand the performance of your system and diagnose problems. For more information on how we use trace data, see New Relic data types. traffic light See health status. transaction A transaction is defined as one logical unit of work in an application. This term primarily refers to server-side transactions monitored by APM. For more information, see documentation about web transactions and non-web transactions. The term transaction is also sometimes used in Browser Monitoring. In that case, it primarily refers to activity beginning with a browser-side web request and ending with a complete page load. transaction trace A transaction trace is a complete picture of a single transaction, down to the database queries and exact invocation patterns. With transaction traces, New Relic gives you much deeper visibility into a single slow transaction, which can help you understand a broader problem. For more information, see Transaction traces. UI The New Relic user interface. For more information, see Standard page functions. user A user can refer to a specific user role in a New Relic account. For more information, see Users. UTC Universal Time Coordinated (UTC), or Coordinated Universal Time, is a standard timestamp for synchronizing time around the world. value function (metrics) The numeric value obtained from metric timeslice data; for example, an average, minimum, maximum, total, sample size, etc. violation A violation occurs when the entity monitored by an alert condition reports a value that crosses the thresholds defined in that condition. For an explanation of how violations relate to other basic alerts concepts, see Concepts and workflow. You can view a summary of the violations for a selected incident's page. You can also view the violations for a specific entity from the product's UI. web external Web external is the term applied to the portion of time spent in transactions to external applications from within the code of the application you are monitoring. That time can be a call to a third party company (a payment provider, for example) or it could be a call to another microservice within your own company. Web external demonstrates how performance is impacted by your code executing outside the application you are measuring. web transaction A transaction is defined as one logical unit of work in an application. This term primarily refers to server-side transactions monitored by APM. Web transactions are initiated with an HTTP request. For most organizations, these represent customer-centric interactions and thus are the most important transactions to monitor. For more information, see Web transactions and Non-web transactions. WebDriverJS WebDriver is a Selenium component, used to control Synthetics scripted browsers. Specifically, Synthetics uses WebDriverJS, a Node.js-based flavor of Selenium. For more information, see Writing scripted browsers and Scripted browser examples. workload A workload represents a group of entities that work together to provide a digital service. For more information, see Workloads.",

      "body": "You can configure the New Relic Ruby agent with settings in a configuration file, environment variables, or programmatically with server-side configuration. This document summarizes the configuration options available for the Ruby agent. If the default value for a configuration option is (Dynamic), this means the Ruby agent calculates the default at runtime. The value for the config setting defaults to the value of another setting as appropriate. Configuration methods and precedence The primary (default) method to configure the Ruby agent is via the configuration file (newrelic.yml) in the config subdirectory. To set configuration values using environment variables: Add the prefix NEW_RELIC_ to the setting's name. Replace any periods . with underscores _. You can also configure a few values in the UI via server-side configuration. The Ruby agent follows this order of precedence for configuration: Environment variables Server-side configuration Configuration file (newrelic.yml) Default configuration settings In other words, environment variables override all other configuration settings and info, server-side configuration overrides the configuration file and default config settings, and so on. View and edit config file options The Ruby agent's newrelic.yml is a standard YAML configuration file. It typically includes a Defaults section at the top, plus sections below for each application environment; for example, Development, Testing, and Production. The Ruby agent determines which section of the newrelic.yml config file to read from by looking at certain environment variables to derive the application's environment. This can be useful, for example, when you want to use info for the log_level config setting in your production environment, and you want more verbose log_level config settings (such as debug in your development environment. Here is an example newrelic.yml config file: common: &default_settings license_key: 'YOUR_LICENSE_KEY' app_name: 'My Application Name' production: <<: *default_settings log_level: info development: <<: *default_settings log_level: debug Copy For non-Rails apps, the Ruby agent looks for the following environment variables, in this order, to determine the application environment: NEW_RELIC_ENV RUBY_ENV RAILS_ENV APP_ENV RACK_ENV If the Ruby agent does not detect values for any of those environment variables, it will default the application environment to development and read from the development section of the newrelic.yml config file. When running the Ruby agent in a Rails app, the agent first looks for the NEW_RELIC_ENV environment variable to determine the application environment and which section of the newrelic.yml to use. If NEW_RELIC_ENV is not present, the agent uses the Rails environment (RAILS_ENV or RAILS.env, depending on the version of Rails) . When you edit the config file, be sure to: Indent only with two spaces. Indent only where relevant, in stanzas such as error_collector. If you do not indent correctly, the agent may throw an Unable to parse configuration file error on startup. To view the most current list of available Ruby agent configuration options, use the rake newrelic:config:docs command. This document describes the most common options. Update the config file This documentation applies to the Ruby agent's latest release. For details on earlier versions, refer to the comments in newrelic.yml itself. To update newrelic.yml file after a new release, use the template in the base directory of the agent gem. When you update to new gem versions, examine or diff config/newrelic.yml and newrelic.yml in the installation directory to take advantage of new configuration options. Important Updating the gem does not automatically update config/newrelic.yml. General These settings are available for agent configuration. Some settings depend on your New Relic subscription level. license_key Type String Default \"\" Environ variable NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY Your New Relic license key. agent_enabled Type Boolean Default (Dynamic) Environ variable NEW_RELIC_AGENT_ENABLED If true, allows the Ruby agent to run. app_name Type String Default (Dynamic) Environ variable NEW_RELIC_APP_NAME Specify the application name used to aggregate data in the New Relic UI. To report data to multiple apps at the same time, specify a list of names separated by a semicolon ;. For example, MyApp or MyStagingApp;Instance1. monitor_mode Type Boolean Default (Dynamic) Environ variable NEW_RELIC_MONITOR_MODE When true, the agent transmits data about your app to the New Relic collector. log_level Type String Default \"info\" Environ variable NEW_RELIC_LOG_LEVEL Sets the level of detail of log messages. Possible log levels, in increasing verbosity, are: error, warn, info or debug. high_security Type Boolean Default false Environ variable NEW_RELIC_HIGH_SECURITY If true, enables high security mode. Ensure you understand the implications of high security mode before enabling this setting. security_policies_token Type String Default \"\" Environ variable NEW_RELIC_SECURITY_POLICIES_TOKEN Applies Language Agent Security Policy settings. proxy_host Type String Default nil Environ variable NEW_RELIC_PROXY_HOST Defines a host for communicating with the New Relic collector via a proxy server. proxy_port Type Integer Default 8080 Environ variable NEW_RELIC_PROXY_PORT Defines a port for communicating with the New Relic collector via a proxy server. proxy_user Type String Default nil Environ variable NEW_RELIC_PROXY_USER Defines a user for communicating with the New Relic collector via a proxy server. proxy_pass Type String Default nil Environ variable NEW_RELIC_PROXY_PASS Defines a password for communicating with the New Relic collector via a proxy server. capture_params Type Boolean Default false Environ variable NEW_RELIC_CAPTURE_PARAMS When true, the agent captures HTTP request parameters and attaches them to transaction traces, traced errors, and TransactionError events. Caution When using the capture_params setting, the Ruby agent will not attempt to filter secret information. Recommendation: To filter secret information from request parameters, use the attributes.include setting instead. For more information, see the Ruby attribute examples. config_path Type String Default (Dynamic) Environ variable NEW_RELIC_CONFIG_PATH Path to newrelic.yml. If undefined, the agent checks the following directories (in order): config/newrelic.yml, newrelic.yml, $HOME/.newrelic/newrelic.yml and $HOME/newrelic.yml. apdex_t Type Float Default 0.5 Environ variable NEW_RELIC_APDEX_T DEPRECATED For agent versions 3.5.0 or higher, set your Apdex T via the New Relic UI. sync_startup Type Boolean Default false Environ variable NEW_RELIC_SYNC_STARTUP When set to true, forces a synchronous connection to the New Relic collector during application startup. For very short-lived processes, this helps ensure the New Relic agent has time to report. send_data_on_exit Type Boolean Default true Environ variable NEW_RELIC_SEND_DATA_ON_EXIT If true, enables the exit handler that sends data to the New Relic collector before shutting down. timeout Type Integer Default 120 Environ variable NEW_RELIC_TIMEOUT Defines the maximum number of seconds the agent should spend attempting to connect to the collector. force_install_exit_handler Type Boolean Default false Environ variable NEW_RELIC_FORCE_INSTALL_EXIT_HANDLER Forces the exit handler that sends all cached data to collector before shutting down to be installed regardless of detecting scenarios where it generally should not be. Known use-case for this option is where Sinatra is running as an embedded service within another framework and the agent is detecting the Sinatra app and skipping the at_exit handler as a result. Sinatra classically runs the entire application in an at_exit block and would otherwise misbehave if the Agent's at_exit handler was also installed in those circumstances. Note: send_data_on_exit should also be set to true in tandem with this setting. log_file_name Type String Default \"newrelic_agent.log\" Environ variable NEW_RELIC_LOG_FILE_NAME Defines a name for the log file. log_file_path Type String Default \"log/\" Environ variable NEW_RELIC_LOG_FILE_PATH Defines a path to the agent log file, excluding the filename. prepend_active_record_instrumentation Type Boolean Default false Environ variable NEW_RELIC_PREPEND_ACTIVE_RECORD_INSTRUMENTATION If true, uses Module#prepend rather than alias_method for ActiveRecord instrumentation. capture_memcache_keys Type Boolean Default false Environ variable NEW_RELIC_CAPTURE_MEMCACHE_KEYS Enable or disable the capture of memcache keys from transaction traces. message_tracer.segment_parameters.enabled Type Boolean Default true Environ variable NEW_RELIC_MESSAGE_TRACER_SEGMENT_PARAMETERS_ENABLED If true, the agent will collect metadata about messages and attach them as segment parameters. marshaller Type String Default \"json\" Environ variable NEW_RELIC_MARSHALLER Specifies a marshaller for transmitting data to the New Relic collector. Currently json is the only valid value for this setting. backport_fast_active_record_connection_lookup Type Boolean Default false Environ variable NEW_RELIC_BACKPORT_FAST_ACTIVE_RECORD_CONNECTION_LOOKUP Backports the faster ActiveRecord connection lookup introduced in Rails 6, which improves agent performance when instrumenting ActiveRecord. Note that this setting may not be compatible with other gems that patch ActiveRecord. labels Type String Default \"\" Environ variable NEW_RELIC_LABELS A dictionary of label names and values that will be applied to the data sent from this agent. May also be expressed as a semicolon-delimited ; string of colon-separated : pairs. For example, <var>Server</var>:<var>One</var>;<var>Data Center</var>:<var>Primary</var>. ca_bundle_path Type String Default nil Environ variable NEW_RELIC_CA_BUNDLE_PATH Manual override for the path to your local CA bundle. This CA bundle will be used to validate the SSL certificate presented by New Relic's data collection service. datastore_tracer.instance_reporting.enabled Type Boolean Default true Environ variable NEW_RELIC_DATASTORE_TRACER_INSTANCE_REPORTING_ENABLED If false, the agent will not report datastore instance metrics, nor add host or port_path_or_id parameters to transaction or slow SQL traces. datastore_tracer.database_name_reporting.enabled Type Boolean Default true Environ variable NEW_RELIC_DATASTORE_TRACER_DATABASE_NAME_REPORTING_ENABLED If false, the agent will not add database_name parameter to transaction or slow sql traces. clear_transaction_state_after_fork Type Boolean Default false Environ variable NEW_RELIC_CLEAR_TRANSACTION_STATE_AFTER_FORK If true, the agent will clear Tracer::State in Agent.drop_buffered_data. exclude_newrelic_header Type Boolean Default false Environ variable NEW_RELIC_EXCLUDE_NEWRELIC_HEADER Allows newrelic distributed tracing headers to be suppressed on outbound requests. infinite_tracing.trace_observer.host Type String Default \"\" Environ variable NEW_RELIC_INFINITE_TRACING_TRACE_OBSERVER_HOST Configures the hostname for the Trace Observer Host. When configured, enables tail-based sampling by sending all recorded spans to a Trace Observer for further sampling decisions, irrespective of any usual agent sampling decision. infinite_tracing.trace_observer.port Type Integer Default 443 Environ variable NEW_RELIC_INFINITE_TRACING_TRACE_OBSERVER_PORT Configures the TCP/IP port for the Trace Observer Host Transaction Tracer The transaction traces feature collects detailed information from a selection of transactions, including a summary of the calling sequence, a breakdown of time spent, and a list of SQL queries and their query plans (on mysql and postgresql). Available features depend on your New Relic subscription level. transaction_tracer.enabled Type Boolean Default true Environ variable NEW_RELIC_TRANSACTION_TRACER_ENABLED If true, enables collection of transaction traces. transaction_tracer.transaction_threshold Type Float Default (Dynamic) Environ variable NEW_RELIC_TRANSACTION_TRACER_TRANSACTION_THRESHOLD Specify a threshold in seconds. Transactions with a duration longer than this threshold are eligible for transaction traces. Specify a float value or the string apdex_f. transaction_tracer.record_sql Type String Default \"obfuscated\" Environ variable NEW_RELIC_TRANSACTION_TRACER_RECORD_SQL Obfuscation level for SQL queries reported in transaction trace nodes.

Configuration overview APM agent configuration options allow you to control some aspects of how the agent behaves. Some of these config options are part of the basic install process (like setting your license key and app name), but most are more advanced settings, such as setting a log level, setting up proxy host access, excluding certain attributes, and enabling distributed tracing. The .NET agent gets its configuration from the newrelic.config file, which is generated as part of the install process. By default, only a global newrelic.config file is created, but you can also create app-local newrelic.config files for finer control over a multi-app system. Other ways to set config options include: using environment variables, or setting server-side configuration from the UI. For more on the various config options and what overrides what, see Config settings precedence. Support for both .NET Framework and .NET Core use the same configuration options and have the same APM features, unless otherwise stated. If you make changes to the config file and want to validate that it's in the right format, you can check it against the XSD file (for example, at C:\\ProgramData\\New Relic\\.NET Agent\\newrelic.xsd for Windows) with any XSD validator. Important For IIS: after you change your newrelic.config or app.config file, perform an IISRESET from an administrative command prompt. Log level adjustments do not require a reset. Configuration methods and precedence levels Upon installation, the .NET agent's configuration file (newrelic.config) applies to all monitored applications, but you can configure the agent in other ways. Here's a diagram showing how different configuration options take precedence over one another: This diagram explains the order of precedence for different ways you might configure the .NET agent. Here are details about the configuration methods shown in the diagram, and their precedence levels: .NET configuration Details and precedence web.config or app.config or appsettings.json Configuration settings set in these files take highest precedence. However, if the agent is disabled in the local or global newrelic.config, the NewRelic.AgentEnabled settings in these files will be ignored. Environment variables Second-highest precedence. For more about these, see .NET environment variables. Server-side configuration Third-highest precedence. A limited number of server-side configuration settings are available; the other settings will come from other configuration sources. App-local newrelic.config Fourth-highest precedence. You can create app-local newrelic.config files to configure individual apps on a multi-app system. These local configuration files override settings in the global newrelic.config file. The agent looks for app-local config files in the following directories, in this order: A directory specified in your web.config or app.config file with the NewRelic.ConfigFile property The web app's root directory (with the app.config or web.config) The directory containing your app's executable file Note that the app-local config file must be complete and validate against the XSD file (for example, at C:\\ProgramData\\New Relic\\.NET Agent\\newrelic.xsd for Windows). Default (global) newrelic.config Default source and the lowest precedence. Will configure all applications on a host in the absence of other config files. The global config file is located in the New Relic agent home directory: %PROGRAMDATA%\\New Relic\\.NET Agent Required environment variables New Relic's .NET agent relies on environment variables to tell the .NET Common Language Runtime (CLR) to attach New Relic to your processes. Some .NET agent install procedures (like the MSI installer) will automatically set these variables for you; some procedures will require you to manually set them. Caution Security recommendation: You should consider what users can set system environment variables. You should also secure the accounts under which your applications execute to prevent user environment variables overriding system environment variables .NET Framework environment variables For .NET Framework, the following variables are required: COR_ENABLE_PROFILING=1 COR_PROFILER={71DA0A04-7777-4EC6-9643-7D28B46A8A41} NEWRELIC_INSTALL_PATH=path\\to\\agent\\directory Copy The .NET agent installer will add these to IIS or as system-wide environment variables. .NET Core environment variables For .NET Core, the following variables are required: Linux: CORECLR_ENABLE_PROFILING=1 CORECLR_PROFILER={36032161-FFC0-4B61-B559-F6C5D41BAE5A} CORECLR_NEWRELIC_HOME=path/to/agent/directory CORECLR_PROFILER_PATH=\"${CORECLR_NEWRELIC_HOME}/libNewRelicProfiler.so\" Copy Windows: CORECLR_ENABLE_PROFILING=1 CORECLR_PROFILER={36032161-FFC0-4B61-B559-F6C5D41BAE5A} NEWRELIC_INSTALL_PATH=path\\to\\agent\\directory CORECLR_NEWRELIC_HOME=path\\to\\agent\\directory Copy The .NET agent installer will add these to IIS or as system-wide environment variables. If your system has previously used monitoring services (non-New Relic), you may have a \"profiler conflict\" when trying to install and use the New Relic agent. More details: Profiler conflict explanation New Relic’s .NET agents rely on environment variables to tell the .NET Common Language Runtime (CLR) to load New Relic into your processes. The install-related environment variables are Microsoft variables, not New Relic variables. They can be used by other .NET profilers, and only one profiler can be attached to a process at a time. For this reason, if you have used previous application monitoring products, you may have profiler conflicts. For specific install instructions, see the .NET agent install documentation. Optional environment variables Some configuration options in New Relic's .NET agent can be set via environment variables as an alternative to setting them in a config file. Below is a list of environment variables recognized by the .NET agent with example values. NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY=XXXXXXXX NEW_RELIC_LOG=MyApp.log NEW_RELIC_APP_NAME=Descriptive Name MAX_TRANSACTION_SAMPLES_STORED=500 MAX_EVENT_SAMPLES_STORED=500 NEW_RELIC_DISTRIBUTED_TRACING_ENABLED=true NEW_RELIC_SPAN_EVENTS_ENABLED=false NEW_RELIC_SPAN_EVENTS_MAX_SAMPLES_STORED=2000 NEW_RELIC_LABELS=foo:bar;zip:zap NEW_RELIC_CONFIG_OBSCURING_KEY=XXXXXXXX NEW_RELIC_DISABLE_SAMPLERS=true NEWRELIC_PROFILER_LOG_DIRECTORY=path\\to\\a\\directory (not configurable via config file) NEWRELIC_LOG_DIRECTORY=path\\to\\a\\directory (Insert a directory where you want to put the agent and profiler logs. You can't set this directory for both agent and profiler logs in the configuration file.) NEWRELIC_LOG_LEVEL=off|error|warn|info|debug|finest|all Copy Setup options, newrelic.config Use these options to setup and configure your agent via the newrelic.config file. The New Relic .NET agent supports the following categories of setup options: Configuration element Service element Obscuring key element Proxy element Log element Application element (configuration) Data transmission element Host name Configuration element The root element of the configuration document is a configuration element. <configuration xmlns=\"urn:newrelic-config\" agentEnabled=\"true\" maxStackTraceLines=\"50\" timingPrecision=\"low\"> Copy The configuration element supports the following attributes: agentEnabled Type Boolean Default true Enable or disable the New Relic agent. maxStackTraceLines Type Integer Default 80 The maximum number of stack frames to trace in any stack dump. timingPrecision Type String Default low Controls the precision of the timers. High precision will provide better data, but at a lower execution speed. Possible values are high and low. Service element The first child of the configuration element is a service element. The service element configures the agent's connection to the New Relic service. <service licenseKey=\"YOUR_LICENSE_KEY\" sendEnvironmentInfo=\"true\" syncStartup=\"false\" sendDataOnExit=\"false\" sendDataOnExitThreshold=\"60000\" autoStart=\"true\"/> Copy The service element supports the following attributes: licenseKey (required) Type String Default (none) Your New Relic license key. New Relic uses the license key to match your app's data to the correct account in the UI. Set the license key via environment variable. Alternatively, set the NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY environment variable in the application's environment. NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY=XXXXXXXX Copy sendEnvironmentInfo Type Boolean Default true Instructs the agent to record execution environment information. Environment information includes operating system, agent version, and which assemblies are available. syncStartup Type Boolean Default false Block application startup until the agent connects to New Relic. If set to true, the first transaction may take substantially longer to complete, because it is blocked until the connection to New Relic is finished. sendDataOnExit Type Boolean Default false Block application shutdown while the agent initiates a final harvest cycle and sends all data to New Relic. sendDataOnExitThreshold Type Integer Default 60000 Unit Milliseconds The minimum amount of time the process must run before the agent blocks it from shutting down. This setting only applies when sendDataOnExit is true. completeTransactionsOnThread Type Boolean Default false If false, the agent uses a pool thread to complete the transaction processing. If true, the agent will complete transaction processing on the request thread. requestTimeout Type Integer Default 2000 (sendDataOnExit enabled) 120000 (sendDataOnExit disabled) Unit Milliseconds The agent's request timeout when communicating with New Relic. autoStart Type Boolean Default True Automatically start the .NET agent when the first instrumented method is hit. Obscuring key element The obscuringKey element is an optional child of the service element. The .NET Agent uses this value to deobfuscate supported configuration values. For example, when an obfuscated proxy password is supplied, it will be deobfuscated using this key. <service licenseKey=\"YOUR_LICENSE_KEY\"> <obscuringKey>OBSCURING_KEY</obscuringKey> </service> Copy The obscuring key may also be configured by setting the NEW_RELIC_CONFIG_OBSCURING_KEY environment variable. Caution Security recommendation: The placement of the obscuring Key in the same configuration file as an obfuscated value may pose a security risk. Consider placing the obscuring key in an environment variable and limiting access to environment variables within your environment. Proxy element The proxy element is an optional child of the service element. The proxy element is used when the agent communicates to the New Relic back-end service via a proxy. <service licenseKey=\"YOUR_LICENSE_KEY\"> <proxy host=\"hostname\" port=\"PROXY_PORT\" uriPath=\"path/to/something.aspx\" domain=\"mydomain.com\" user=\"PROXY_USERNAME\" password=\"PROXY_PASSWORD\" passwordObfuscated=\"OBFUSCATED_PROXY_PASSWORD\"/> </service> Copy The proxy element supports the following attributes: host Type String Default (none) Defines the proxy host. port Type Integer Default 8080 Defines the proxy port. uriPath Type String Default (none) Optionally define a proxy URI path. domain Type String Default (none) Optionally define a domain to use when authenticating with the proxy server. user Type String Default (none) Optionally define a user name for authentication. password Type String Default (none) Optionally define a password for authentication. passwordObfuscated Type String Default (none) For additional security, the .NET Agent supports the use of an obfuscated proxy password with the passwordObfuscated attribute. The obfuscated proxy password is generated using the following New Relic CLI command: newrelic agent config obfuscate --key OBSCURING_KEY --value \"CLEAR_TEXT_PROXY_PASSWORD\" Copy Important When using an obfuscated proxy password, the obscuring key must also be configured. Log element The log element is a child of the configuration element. The log element configures New Relic's logging . The agent generates its own log file to keep its logging information separate from your application's logs. <log level=\"info\" auditLog=\"false\" console=\"false\" directory=\"PATH\\TO\\LOG\\DIRECTORY\" fileName=\"FILENAME.log\" /> Copy The log element supports the following attributes: level Type String Default info Defines the level of detail recorded in the log file. Possible values, in increasing order of detail, are: off error warn info debug finest all Alternatively, set the NEWRELIC_LOG_LEVEL environment variable in the application's environment. Important Increasing the log level will increase New Relic's performance impact. auditLog Type Boolean Default false Records all data sent to and received from New Relic in both an auditlog log file and the standard log file. console Type Boolean Default false Send log messages to the console, in addition to the log file. directory Type String Default C:\\ProgramData\\New Relic\\.NET Agent\\Logs The directory to hold log files generated by the agent. If this is omitted, then a directory named logs in the New Relic agent install area will be used by default. fileName Type String Default (none) Defines a name for the log file. If you do not define a fileName, the name is derived from the name of the monitored process. Alternatively, set the NEW_RELIC_LOG environment variable in the application's environment. NEW_RELIC_LOG=MyApp.log Copy Application element (required) The application element is a child of the configuration element. This required element defines your application name, and disables or enables sampling. name Type String Default My Application The name of your .NET application is a child of the application element. New Relic will aggregate your data according to this name. For example, if you have two running applications named AppA and AppB, you will see two applications in the New Relic interface: AppA and AppB. You can also assign up to three names to your app. The first name is the primary name. For example: <application> <name>MY APPLICATION PRIMARY</name> <name>SECOND APP NAME</name> <name>THIRD APP NAME</name> </application> Copy Alternatively, set the NEW_RELIC_APP_NAME environment variable in the application's environment. NEW_RELIC_APP_NAME=Descriptive Name Copy disableSamplers Type Boolean Default false Samplers collect information about memory and CPU consumption. Set this to true to disable sampling. Alternatively, set the NEW_RELIC_DISABLE_SAMPLERS environment variable in the application's environment. NEW_RELIC_DISABLE_SAMPLERS=true Copy Data transmission element The dataTransmission element is a child of the configuration element. This element affects how data is sent to New Relic and can be used if you have specific data transmission requirements. <dataTransmission putForDataSend=\"false\" compressedContentEncoding=\"deflate\"/> Copy The dataTransmission element supports the following attributes: putForDataSend Type Boolean Default false Defines the HTTP method used when sending data to New Relic. Set this to true to enable using the PUT method when sending data. The POST method is used by default. Host name If the default host name label in the APM UI is not useful, you can decorate that name in the New Relic UI with a display name. After the application process is restarted and the .NET agent is reporting again, the display name will appear in the Servers drop-down list. This host name setting does not affect the list of hosts on your application's Summary page. To set a display name, choose one of the following options. The environment variable takes precedence over the config file value. Then restart your application to see your changes in the New Relic UI. Set using config file Set the displayName attribute in the processHost element in newrelic.config. The processHost element is a child of the configuration element. <configuration . . . > <processHost displayName=\"CUSTOM_NAME\" /> </configuration> Copy Set using environment variable Set the NEW_RELIC_PROCESS_HOST_DISPLAY_NAME environment variable: NEW_RELIC_PROCESS_HOST_DISPLAY_NAME = \"CUSTOM_NAME\" Copy Cloud platform utilization Configures the utilization configuration element to control how the agent collects utilization information and sends it to the New Relic service to determine pricing. The agent can collect information from Amazon Web Services (AWS) EC2 instances, Docker containers, Azure, Google Cloud Platform, Pivotal Cloud Foundry, and Kubernetes. detectAws Type Boolean Default true Determines whether the agent polls AWS metadata API. detectAzure Type Boolean Default true Determines whether the agent polls Azure metadata API. detectGcp Type Boolean Default true Determines whether the agent polls GCP metadata API. detectPcf Type Boolean Default true Determines whether the agent polls PCF information from environment variables. detectDocker Type Boolean Default true Determines whether the agent reads Docker information from the file system. detectKubernetes Type Boolean Default true Determines whether the agent polls Kubernetes information from environment variables. Instrumentation options Use these options to configure which elements of your application and environment to instrument. New Relic for .NET supports the following categories of instrumentation options: Instrumentation element Applications element (instrumentation) Attributes element Instrumentation element The instrumentation element is a child of the configuration element. By default, the .NET agent instruments IIS asp worker processes and Azure web and worker roles. To instrument other processes, see Instrumenting custom applications. Applications element (instrumentation) The applications element is a child of the instrumentation element. The applications element specifies which non-web apps to instrument. It contains a name attribute. Important This is not the same as the application (configuration) element, which is a child of the configuration element. <instrumentation> <applications> <application name=\"MyService1.exe\" /> <application name=\"MyService2.exe\" /> <application name=\"MyService3.exe\" /> </applications> </instrumentation> Copy Attributes element An attribute is a key/value pair that determines the properties of an event or transaction. Each attribute is sent to APM transaction traces, APM error traces, Transaction events, TransactionError events, or PageView events. The primary attributes element enables or disables attribute collection for the .NET agent, and defines specific attributes to collect or exclude. You can also configure attribute settings based on their destination: Error collection, transaction traces, browser instrumentation, and transaction events. In this example, the agent excludes all attributes whose key begins with myApiKey (myApiKey.bar, myApiKey.value), but collects the custom attribute myApiKey.foo. <attributes enabled=\"true\"> <exclude>myApiKey.*</exclude> <include>myApiKey.foo</include> </attributes> Copy You can view the .NET APM attributes on the .NET agent attributes page. You can also define custom attributes with the agent API call AddCustomAttribute. enabled Type Boolean Default true Enable or disable attribute collection. When set to false in the primary attribute element, this setting overrides all attribute settings for individual destinations. include Type String Default (none) If attributes are enabled, the agent will collect all attribute keys specified in this list. To specify multiple attribute keys, specify each individually. You can also use a * wildcard character at the end of a key to match multiple attributes (for example, myApiKey.*). For more information, see Attribute rules. exclude Type String Default (none) If attributes are enabled, the agent will not collect attribute keys specified in this list. To specify multiple attribute keys, specify each individually. You can also use a * wildcard character at the end of a key to match multiple attributes (for example, myApiKey.*). For more information, see Attribute rules. Feature options Use these options to enable, disable, and configure New Relic features. New Relic for .NET allows you to configure the following features: App pools Cross application traces Error collection High security mode Strip exception messages Transaction events Custom events Custom parameters Tags/labels Browser instrumentation Slow Queries Transaction traces Datastore tracer Distributed tracing Span events Capture HTTP Request Headers App pools Important This is only applicable to a system's global config file. The applicationPools element is a child of the configuration element. The applicationPools element specifies for the profiler exactly which application pools to instrument and uses the same name as the IIS application pool name. This configuration element is useful when you may need to instrument only a small subset of your app pools. For example, a given server might have several hundred application pools, but only a few of those pools need to be instrumented by the .NET agent. Here is an example of disabling instrumentation for specific application pools: <applicationPools> <applicationPool name=\"Foo\" instrument=\"false\"/> <applicationPool name=\"Bar\" instrument=\"false\"/> </applicationPools> Copy Here is an example of disabling instrumentation for all application pools currently executing on the server and enabling instrumentation for specific application pools: <applicationPools> <defaultBehavior instrument=\"false\"/> <applicationPool name=\"Foo\" instrument=\"true\"/> <applicationPool name=\"Bar\" instrument=\"true\"/> </applicationPools> Copy The applicationPools element supports the following elements: defaultBehavior Type Boolean Default false Defines how the .NET agent will behave on a \"global\" level for application pools served via IIS. The .NET agent instruments all application pools by default. When true, application pools listed under applicationPool with an instrument attribute set to false will not be instrumented. Essentially, when set to false, the application pool list acts as an allow list. When set to true, the application pool list acts as a deny list. applicationPool Defines instrumentation behavior for a specific application pool. The name attribute is the name of an application pool. Enable or disable profiling in the instrument attribute. Define this application in the name attribute. Cross application traces The crossApplicationTracer element is a child of the configuration element. crossApplicationTracer links transaction traces across applications. When linked in a service-oriented architecture, all instrumented applications that communicate with each other via HTTP will now \"link\" transaction traces with the applications that they call and the applications they are called by. Cross application tracing makes it easier to understand the performance relationship between services and applications. <crossApplicationTracer enabled=\"true\"/> Copy The crossApplicationTracer element supports the following attribute: enabled Type Boolean Default true Enable or disable cross application tracing Error collection The errorCollector element is a child of the configuration element. errorCollector configures error collection, which captures information about uncaught exceptions and sends them to New Relic. <errorCollector enabled=\"true\" captureEvents=\"true\" maxEventSamplesStored=\"100\"> <ignoreClasses> <errorClass>System.IO.FileNotFoundException</errorClass> <errorClass>System.Threading.ThreadAbortException</errorClass> </ignoreClasses> <ignoreMessages> <errorClass name=\"System.Exception\"> <message>Ignore message</message> <message>Ignore too</message> </errorClass> </ignoreMessages> <ignoreStatusCodes> <code>401</code> <code>404</code> </ignoreStatusCodes> <expectedClasses> <errorClass>System.ArgumentNullException</errorClass> <errorClass>System.ArgumentOutOfRangeException</errorClass> </expectedClasses> <expectedMessages> <errorClass name=\"System.Exception\"> <message>Expected message</message> <message>Expected too</message> </errorClass> </expectedMessages> <expectedStatusCodes>403,500-505</expectedStatusCodes> <attributes enabled=\"true\"> <exclude>myApiKey.*</exclude> <include>myApiKey.foo</include> </attributes> </errorCollector> Copy Tip For an overview of error configuration in APM, see Manage errors in APM. Important expectedClasses, expectedMessages, and expectedStatusCodes configuration settings require .NET agent version 8.31.0.0 or higher. The errorCollector element supports the following elements and attributes: enabled Type Boolean Default true Enable or disable the error collector. captureEvents Type Boolean Default true Enable or disable the capturing of error events. maxEventSamplesStored Type Integer Default 100 Reservoir limit for error events. ignoreClasses A list of fully qualified class names to be ignored. The maximum number of error class and message combinations that SHOULD be reported is 50. If more than 50 are listed, then only the first 50 SHOULD be used ignoreMessages An optional map of fully qualified class names to list of strings matching a substring of the message of an error. The maximum number of error class and message combinations that SHOULD be reported is 50. If more than 50 are listed, then only the first 50 SHOULD be used ignoreErrors (obsolete) Type String Default (none) Lists specific exceptions to not report to New Relic. The full name of the exception should be used, such as System.IO.FileNotFoundException. ignoreStatusCodes Type String Default (none) Lists specific HTTP error codes to not report to New Relic. You can use standard integral HTTP error codes, such as just 401, or you may use Microsoft full status codes with decimal points, such as 401.4 or 403.18. The status codes should be equal to or greater than 400. expectedClasses A list of fully qualified class names to be marked as expected. The maximum number of error class and message combinations that SHOULD be reported is 50. If more than 50 are listed, then only the first 50 SHOULD be used expectedMessages An optional map of fully qualified class names to list of strings matching a substring of the message of an error. The maximum number of error class and message combinations that SHOULD be reported is 50. If more than 50 are listed, then only the first 50 SHOULD be used expectedStatusCodes A comma separated list of status codes. The list may include integer ranges, using a single dash (-) and will be inclusive of both the starting and ending integer in the range. attributes Use this sub-element to customize your agent attribute settings for error traces. This sub-element uses the same settings as the primary attributes element: enabled, include, and exclude. High security mode The highSecurity element is a child of the configuration element. To enable high security mode, set this property to true and enable the high security property in the New Relic user interface. Enabling high security turns SSL on; request parameters, custom parameters and HTTP request headers are not collected; strip exception messages is enabled; and queries can't be sent to New Relic in their raw form. enabled Type Boolean Default false Enable or disable high security mode. Example: <highSecurity enabled=\"true\"/> Copy Strip exception messages The stripExceptionMessages element is a child of the configuration element. To enable strip exception messages, set this property to true. By default, this is set to false, which means that the agent sends messages from all exceptions to the New Relic collector. If you enable high security mode, this is automatically changed to true, and the agent strips the messages from exceptions. enabled Type Boolean Default false Enable or disable strip exception messages. Example: <stripExceptionMessages enabled=\"true\"/> Copy Transaction events The transactionEvents element is a child of the configuration element. Use transactionEvents to configure transaction events. <transactionEvents enabled=\"true\" maximumSamplesStored=\"10000\"> <attributes enabled=\"true\"> <exclude>myApiKey.*</exclude> <include>myApiKey.foo</include> </attributes> </transactionEvents> Copy The transactionEvents element supports the following attributes: enabled Type Boolean Default true Enable or disable the event recorder. maximumSamplesStored Type Integer Default 10000 The maximum number of samples to store in memory at once. Alternatively, set the MAX_TRANSACTION_SAMPLES_STORED environment variable in the application's environment. MAX_TRANSACTION_SAMPLES_STORED=500 Copy attributes Use this sub-element to customize your agent attribute settings for transaction events. This sub-element uses the same settings as the primary attributes element: enabled, include, and exclude. Tip These attribute settings are specific to transaction events. Attribute settings can be applied globally to all event types to with this configuration setting. Caution When distributed tracing and/or Infinite Tracing are enabled, information from transaction events is applied to the root Span Event of the transaction. Consider applying any attribute settings for transaction events to span events and/or apply them as Global Attribute settings. Custom events The customEvents element is a child of the configuration element. Use customEvents to configure custom events. <customEvents enabled=\"true\" maximumSamplesStored=\"10000\"/> Copy The CustomEvents element supports the following attributes: enabled Type Boolean Default true Enable or disable the event recorder. maximumSamplesStored Type Integer Default 10000 The maximum number of samples to store in memory at once. Alternatively, set the MAX_EVENT_SAMPLES_STORED environment variable in the application's environment. MAX_EVENT_SAMPLES_STORED=500 Copy Custom parameters The customParameters element is a child of the configuration element. Use customParameters to configure custom parameters. <customParameters enabled=\"true\" /> Copy The CustomParameters element supports the following attributes: enabled Type Boolean Default true Enable or disable the capture of custom parameters. Labels (tags) The labels element is a child of the configuration element. This sets tag names and values. The list is a semicolon delimited list of colon-separated name and value pairs. You can also use with the NEW_RELIC_LABELS environment variable. Example: <labels>foo:bar;zip:zap</labels> Copy Browser instrumentation The browserMonitoring element is a child of the configuration element. browserMonitoring configures browser monitoring in your .NET application. Browser gives you insight your end users' performance experience. This is accomplished by measuring the time it takes for your users' browsers to download and render your webpages by injecting a small amount of JavaScript code into the header and footer of each page. // If you use both the Exclude and Attribute elements // the Exclude element must be listed first. <browserMonitoring autoInstrument=\"true\"> <requestPathsExcluded> <path regex=\"url-regex-1\"/> <path regex=\"url-regex-2\"/> ... <path regex=\"url-regex-n\"/> </requestPathsExcluded> <attributes enabled=\"true\"> <exclude>myApiKey.*</exclude> <include>myApiKey.foo</include> </attributes> </browserMonitoring> Copy The browserMonitoring element supports the following attributes: autoInstrument Type Boolean Default true By default the agent automatically injects the browser agent JavaScript. To turn off automatic injection, set this attribute to false. attributes Use this sub-element to customize your agent attribute settings for browser monitoring. This sub-element uses the same settings as the primary attributes element: enabled, include, and exclude. requestPathsExcluded Use this sub-element to prevent the browser agent from being injected in specific pages. The element is used as follows: <requestPathsExcluded> <path regex=\"url-regex-1\"/> <path regex=\"url-regex-2\"/> ... <path regex=\"url-regex-n\"/> </requestPathsExcluded> Copy The agent will not inject the browser agent into pages whose URL matches one of the specified regular expressions. The regular expression should follow Microsoft guidelines for the Regex class. It is a reference to the virtual directory of the path in your application and not the full URL of the path you wish to exclude. For example, to exclude the pages in https://www.mywebsite.com/mywebpages/ you would simply insert /mywebpages/ as the path regex value. The requestPathsExcluded element should be used in cases where it is impossible or undesirable to use the DisableBrowserMonitoring() call. To minimize a possible performance impact try to use as few regular expressions as possible and keep them as simple as possible. Slow queries The slowSql element is a child of the configuration element. slowSql configures capturing information about slow query executions, and captures and obfuscates explain plans for these queries. <slowSql enabled=\"true\"/> Copy The slowSql element supports the following attribute: enabled Type Boolean Default true Enable or disable slow query tracing. Transaction traces The transactionTracer element is a child of the configuration element. transactionTracer configures transaction traces. Included in the trace is the exact call sequence of the transactions, including any query statements issued. <transactionTracer enabled=\"true\" transactionThreshold=\"apdex_f\" recordSql=\"obfuscated\" explainEnabled=\"true\" explainThreshold=\"500\" maxSegments=\"3000\" maxExplainPlans=\"20\"> <attributes enabled=\"true\"> <exclude>myApiKey.*</exclude> <include>myApiKey.foo</include> </attributes> </transactionTracer> Copy The transactionTracer element supports the following attributes: enabled Type Boolean Default true Enable or disable transaction traces. transactionThreshold Type String Default apdex_f Defines the threshold for transaction traces. If a transaction takes longer than the threshold, it is eligible for being traced. See transaction trace basics for more about the rules governing traces. The default value is apdex_f, which sets the threshold to four times the application's apdex_t value. For more information about apdex_t, see Apdex. You can also set the threshold to be a specific time value in milliseconds. recordSql Type String Default obfuscated Select a query tracing policy. Options are off, which records nothing; obfuscated, which records an obfuscated version of the query; or raw, which records the query exactly as it is issued to the database. Caution Recording raw queries may capture sensitive information. explainEnabled Type Boolean Default false When true, the agent captures EXPLAIN statements for slow queries. explainThreshold Type Integer Default 500 Unit Milliseconds The agent collects slow query data for queries that exceed this threshold, along with any available explain plans, as part of transaction traces. maxSegments Type Integer Default 3000 The maximum number of segments to collect in a transaction trace. maxExplainPlans Type Integer Default 20 The maximum number of explain plans to collect during a harvest cycle. maxStackTrace Type Integer Default 0 By default maxStackTrace is set to 0, which disables stack traces as part of a transaction trace. If this value is set greater than 0, then stack traces will be captured for transaction traces. attributes Use this sub-element to customize your agent attribute settings for transaction traces. This sub-element uses the same settings as the primary attributes element: enabled, include, and exclude. Datastore tracer The datastoreTracer element is a child of the configuration element. <datastoreTracer> <instanceReporting enabled=\"true\" /> <databaseNameReporting enabled=\"true\" /> <queryParameters enabled=\"false\" /> </datastoreTracer> Copy The datastoreTracer element supports the following sub-elements: instanceReporting Use this sub-element to enable collection of datastore instance metrics (such as the host and port) for some database drivers. These are reported on slow query traces and transaction traces. The default value of attribute enabled is true. databaseNameReporting Use this sub-element to enable collection of the database name on slow query traces and transaction traces for some database drivers. The default value of attribute enabled is true. queryParameters Use this sub-element to enable collection of the SQL query parameters on slow query traces. The default value of attribute enabled is false. Caution Recording query parameters may capture sensitive information. The transactionTracer.recordSql configuration option must be set to raw or this option is ignored. Distributed tracing The distributedTracing element is a child of the configuration element. <distributedTracing enabled=\"false\" excludeNewrelicHeader=\"false\"/> Copy Distributed tracing lets you see the path that a request takes as it travels through a distributed system. Enabling distributed tracing disables cross application tracing, and has other effects on APM features. Before enabling, read the planning guide. Important Requires .NET agent version 8.6.45.0 or higher. The distributedTracing element supports the following attributes: To enable or disable, see Enable distributed tracing. enabled Type Boolean Default false Alternatively, enable distributed tracing via the NEW_RELIC_DISTRIBUTED_TRACING_ENABLED environment variable in the application's environment. NEW_RELIC_DISTRIBUTED_TRACING_ENABLED=true Copy excludeNewrelicHeader Type Boolean Default false By default, supported versions of the agent utilize both the newrelic header and W3C Trace Context headers for distributed tracing. The newrelic distributed tracing header allows interoperability with older agents that don't support W3C Trace Context headers. Agent versions that support W3C Trace Context headers will prioritize them over newrelic headers for distributed tracing. If you do not want to utilize the newrelic header, setting this to true will result in the agent excluding the newrelic header and only using W3C Trace Context headers for distributed tracing. Distributed tracing reports span events. Span event reporting is enabled by default, but distributed tracing must be enabled for spans to be reported. To disable span events, choose one of the following options: Disable span events via config file Set the <spanEvents> element to false to disable via the newrelic.config file. This element is a child of the <configuration> element. <configuration . . . > <spanEvents enabled=\"false\" /> </configuration> Copy Disable span events via environment variable Set the NEW_RELIC_SPAN_EVENTS_ENABLED environment variable in the application's environment. NEW_RELIC_SPAN_EVENTS_ENABLED=false Copy Infinite Tracing Infinite Tracing extends the distributed tracing service by employing a trace observer that is external to the agent. It observes 100% of your application traces across various services and provides actionable data so you can solve issues faster. Important Infinite Tracing requires .NET Agent version 8.30 or higher. To turn on Infinite Tracing, enable distributed tracing and add the additional settings below <configuration . . . > <distributedTracing enabled=\"true\" /> <infiniteTracing> <trace_observer host=\"YOUR_TRACE_OBSERVER_HOST\" /> </infiniteTracing> </configuration> Copy The infiniteTracing element supports the following elements: trace_observer The trace_observer element identifies an observer host that is independent from the agent. For help getting a valid Infinite Tracing trace observer host entry, see Find or create a trace observer endpoint. The trace observer may be configured using the NEW_RELIC_INFINITE_TRACING_TRACE_OBSERVER_HOST environment variable as well. Important When configuring the trace observer, you should not supply the protocol as part of the host. For example, use myhost.infinitetracing.com instead of https://myhost.infinitetracing.com. Span events The spanEvents element is a child of the configuration element. Use spanEvents to configure span events. <spanEvents enabled=\"true\"> <attributes enabled=\"true\"> <exclude>myApiKey.*</exclude> <include>myApiKey.foo</include> </attributes> </spanEvents> Copy The spanEvents element supports the following attributes: enabled Type Boolean Default true Enable or disable the event recorder. maximumSamplesStored Type Int Default 2000 The maximum number of samples to store in memory at a time. This may be configured using the NEW_RELIC_SPAN_EVENTS_MAX_SAMPLES_STORED environment variable as well. Important This configuration option is only available in the .NET Agent v9.0 or higher. attributes Use this sub-element to customize your agent attribute settings for span events. This sub-element uses the same settings as the primary attributes element: enabled, include, and exclude. Tip These attribute settings are specific to span events. Attribute settings may be applied globally to all event types to with this configuration setting. Capture HTTP Request Headers The allowAllHeaders element is a child of the configuration element. Set this to true to allow the .NET Agent to capture all HTTP request headers as request.headers.{http-header-name} attributes. Set this to false to only allow the .NET agent to collect the following HTTP request headers: request.headers.referer request.headers.accept request.headers.content-length request.headers.host request.headers.user-agent Copy enabled Type Boolean Default false Enable or disable HTTP request headers capture. Example: <allowAllHeaders enabled=\"true\" /> <attributes enabled=\"true\"> <include>request.headers.*</include> </attributes> Copy Important The allowAllHeaders setting is only available in the .NET Agent version 8.40.0+. When using allowAllHeaders to capture attributes, the captured request header attributes are still being controlled by the root level and destination level attributes settings. Without setting the request.header.* in the include list under the attributes element (see the following), the .NET Agent still filters out all header attributes. The default newrelic.config is set to include the request.header.*. <allowAllHeaders enabled=\"true\" /> <attributes enabled=\"true\"> <include>request.headers.*</include> ... </attributes> Copy The default newrelic.config is also set to explicitly exclude the following HTTP request headers to prevent the .NET Agent collecting unwanted data. <attributes enabled=\"true\"> <exclude>request.headers.cookie</exclude> <exclude>request.headers.authorization</exclude> <exclude>request.headers.proxy-authorization</exclude> <exclude>request.headers.x-*</exclude> </attributes> Copy Settings in app.config or web.config For ASP.NET and .NET Framework console apps you can also configure the following settings in your app's app.config or web.config, within the outermost element, <configuration>: Enable and disable the agent <appSettings> <add key = \"NewRelic.AgentEnabled\" value=\"false\" /> </appSettings> Copy Important If the agent is disabled in the local or global newrelic.config, the NewRelic.AgentEnabled settings in these files will be ignored. Application name For more information, see Name your .NET application. <appSettings> <add key = \"NewRelic.AppName\" value =\"Descriptive Name\" /> </appSettings> Copy License key <appSettings> <add key = \"NewRelic.LicenseKey\" value =\"XXXXXXXX\" /> </appSettings> Copy Change newrelic.config location Designates an alternative location for the config file outside of the local root of the app or global config location. The location entered must be an absolute path. <appSettings> <add key = \"NewRelic.ConfigFile\" value=\"C:\\Path-to-alternate-config-dir\\newrelic.config\" /> </appSettings> Copy Settings in appsettings.json For .NET Core apps, you can configure the following settings in appsettings.json if the following is true: The appsettings.json file must be located in the current working directory of the application. The application must have the following dependencies: Microsoft.Extensions.Configuration Microsoft.Extensions.Configuration.Json Microsoft.Extensions.Configuration.EnvironmentVariables Enable and disable the agent { \"NewRelic.AgentEnabled\":\"false\" } Copy Important If the agent is disabled in the local or global newrelic.config, the NewRelic.AgentEnabled setting in this file will be ignored. Application name For more information, see Name your .NET application. { \"NewRelic.AppName\": \"Descriptive Name\" } Copy License key { \"NewRelic.LicenseKey\": \"XXXXXXXX\" } Copy Change newrelic.config location Designates an alternative location for the config file outside of the local root of the app or global config location. The location entered must be an absolute path. { \"NewRelic.ConfigFile\": \"C:\\\\Path-to-alternate-config-dir\\\\newrelic.config\" } Copy",

      "body": "You can configure the New Relic Ruby agent with settings in a configuration file, environment variables, or programmatically with server-side configuration. This document summarizes the configuration options available for the Ruby agent. If the default value for a configuration option is (Dynamic), this means the Ruby agent calculates the default at runtime. The value for the config setting defaults to the value of another setting as appropriate. Configuration methods and precedence The primary (default) method to configure the Ruby agent is via the configuration file (newrelic.yml) in the config subdirectory. To set configuration values using environment variables: Add the prefix NEW_RELIC_ to the setting's name. Replace any periods . with underscores _. You can also configure a few values in the UI via server-side configuration. The Ruby agent follows this order of precedence for configuration: Environment variables Server-side configuration Configuration file (newrelic.yml) Default configuration settings In other words, environment variables override all other configuration settings and info, server-side configuration overrides the configuration file and default config settings, and so on. View and edit config file options The Ruby agent's newrelic.yml is a standard YAML configuration file. It typically includes a Defaults section at the top, plus sections below for each application environment; for example, Development, Testing, and Production. The Ruby agent determines which section of the newrelic.yml config file to read from by looking at certain environment variables to derive the application's environment. This can be useful, for example, when you want to use info for the log_level config setting in your production environment, and you want more verbose log_level config settings (such as debug in your development environment. Here is an example newrelic.yml config file: common: &default_settings license_key: 'YOUR_LICENSE_KEY' app_name: 'My Application Name' production: <<: *default_settings log_level: info development: <<: *default_settings log_level: debug Copy For non-Rails apps, the Ruby agent looks for the following environment variables, in this order, to determine the application environment: NEW_RELIC_ENV RUBY_ENV RAILS_ENV APP_ENV RACK_ENV If the Ruby agent does not detect values for any of those environment variables, it will default the application environment to development and read from the development section of the newrelic.yml config file. When running the Ruby agent in a Rails app, the agent first looks for the NEW_RELIC_ENV environment variable to determine the application environment and which section of the newrelic.yml to use. If NEW_RELIC_ENV is not present, the agent uses the Rails environment (RAILS_ENV or RAILS.env, depending on the version of Rails) . When you edit the config file, be sure to: Indent only with two spaces. Indent only where relevant, in stanzas such as error_collector. If you do not indent correctly, the agent may throw an Unable to parse configuration file error on startup. To view the most current list of available Ruby agent configuration options, use the rake newrelic:config:docs command. This document describes the most common options. Update the config file This documentation applies to the Ruby agent's latest release. For details on earlier versions, refer to the comments in newrelic.yml itself. To update newrelic.yml file after a new release, use the template in the base directory of the agent gem. When you update to new gem versions, examine or diff config/newrelic.yml and newrelic.yml in the installation directory to take advantage of new configuration options. Important Updating the gem does not automatically update config/newrelic.yml. General These settings are available for agent configuration. Some settings depend on your New Relic subscription level. license_key Type String Default \"\" Environ variable NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY Your New Relic license key. agent_enabled Type Boolean Default (Dynamic) Environ variable NEW_RELIC_AGENT_ENABLED If true, allows the Ruby agent to run. app_name Type String Default (Dynamic) Environ variable NEW_RELIC_APP_NAME Specify the application name used to aggregate data in the New Relic UI. To report data to multiple apps at the same time, specify a list of names separated by a semicolon ;. For example, MyApp or MyStagingApp;Instance1. monitor_mode Type Boolean Default (Dynamic) Environ variable NEW_RELIC_MONITOR_MODE When true, the agent transmits data about your app to the New Relic collector. log_level Type String Default \"info\" Environ variable NEW_RELIC_LOG_LEVEL Sets the level of detail of log messages. Possible log levels, in increasing verbosity, are: error, warn, info or debug. high_security Type Boolean Default false Environ variable NEW_RELIC_HIGH_SECURITY If true, enables high security mode. Ensure you understand the implications of high security mode before enabling this setting. security_policies_token Type String Default \"\" Environ variable NEW_RELIC_SECURITY_POLICIES_TOKEN Applies Language Agent Security Policy settings. proxy_host Type String Default nil Environ variable NEW_RELIC_PROXY_HOST Defines a host for communicating with the New Relic collector via a proxy server. proxy_port Type Integer Default 8080 Environ variable NEW_RELIC_PROXY_PORT Defines a port for communicating with the New Relic collector via a proxy server. proxy_user Type String Default nil Environ variable NEW_RELIC_PROXY_USER Defines a user for communicating with the New Relic collector via a proxy server. proxy_pass Type String Default nil Environ variable NEW_RELIC_PROXY_PASS Defines a password for communicating with the New Relic collector via a proxy server. capture_params Type Boolean Default false Environ variable NEW_RELIC_CAPTURE_PARAMS When true, the agent captures HTTP request parameters and attaches them to transaction traces, traced errors, and TransactionError events. Caution When using the capture_params setting, the Ruby agent will not attempt to filter secret information. Recommendation: To filter secret information from request parameters, use the attributes.include setting instead. For more information, see the Ruby attribute examples. config_path Type String Default (Dynamic) Environ variable NEW_RELIC_CONFIG_PATH Path to newrelic.yml. If undefined, the agent checks the following directories (in order): config/newrelic.yml, newrelic.yml, $HOME/.newrelic/newrelic.yml and $HOME/newrelic.yml. apdex_t Type Float Default 0.5 Environ variable NEW_RELIC_APDEX_T DEPRECATED For agent versions 3.5.0 or higher, set your Apdex T via the New Relic UI. sync_startup Type Boolean Default false Environ variable NEW_RELIC_SYNC_STARTUP When set to true, forces a synchronous connection to the New Relic collector during application startup. For very short-lived processes, this helps ensure the New Relic agent has time to report. send_data_on_exit Type Boolean Default true Environ variable NEW_RELIC_SEND_DATA_ON_EXIT If true, enables the exit handler that sends data to the New Relic collector before shutting down. timeout Type Integer Default 120 Environ variable NEW_RELIC_TIMEOUT Defines the maximum number of seconds the agent should spend attempting to connect to the collector. force_install_exit_handler Type Boolean Default false Environ variable NEW_RELIC_FORCE_INSTALL_EXIT_HANDLER Forces the exit handler that sends all cached data to collector before shutting down to be installed regardless of detecting scenarios where it generally should not be. Known use-case for this option is where Sinatra is running as an embedded service within another framework and the agent is detecting the Sinatra app and skipping the at_exit handler as a result. Sinatra classically runs the entire application in an at_exit block and would otherwise misbehave if the Agent's at_exit handler was also installed in those circumstances. Note: send_data_on_exit should also be set to true in tandem with this setting. log_file_name Type String Default \"newrelic_agent.log\" Environ variable NEW_RELIC_LOG_FILE_NAME Defines a name for the log file. log_file_path Type String Default \"log/\" Environ variable NEW_RELIC_LOG_FILE_PATH Defines a path to the agent log file, excluding the filename. prepend_active_record_instrumentation Type Boolean Default false Environ variable NEW_RELIC_PREPEND_ACTIVE_RECORD_INSTRUMENTATION If true, uses Module#prepend rather than alias_method for ActiveRecord instrumentation. capture_memcache_keys Type Boolean Default false Environ variable NEW_RELIC_CAPTURE_MEMCACHE_KEYS Enable or disable the capture of memcache keys from transaction traces. message_tracer.segment_parameters.enabled Type Boolean Default true Environ variable NEW_RELIC_MESSAGE_TRACER_SEGMENT_PARAMETERS_ENABLED If true, the agent will collect metadata about messages and attach them as segment parameters. marshaller Type String Default \"json\" Environ variable NEW_RELIC_MARSHALLER Specifies a marshaller for transmitting data to the New Relic collector. Currently json is the only valid value for this setting. backport_fast_active_record_connection_lookup Type Boolean Default false Environ variable NEW_RELIC_BACKPORT_FAST_ACTIVE_RECORD_CONNECTION_LOOKUP Backports the faster ActiveRecord connection lookup introduced in Rails 6, which improves agent performance when instrumenting ActiveRecord. Note that this setting may not be compatible with other gems that patch ActiveRecord. labels Type String Default \"\" Environ variable NEW_RELIC_LABELS A dictionary of label names and values that will be applied to the data sent from this agent. May also be expressed as a semicolon-delimited ; string of colon-separated : pairs. For example, <var>Server</var>:<var>One</var>;<var>Data Center</var>:<var>Primary</var>. ca_bundle_path Type String Default nil Environ variable NEW_RELIC_CA_BUNDLE_PATH Manual override for the path to your local CA bundle. This CA bundle will be used to validate the SSL certificate presented by New Relic's data collection service. datastore_tracer.instance_reporting.enabled Type Boolean Default true Environ variable NEW_RELIC_DATASTORE_TRACER_INSTANCE_REPORTING_ENABLED If false, the agent will not report datastore instance metrics, nor add host or port_path_or_id parameters to transaction or slow SQL traces. datastore_tracer.database_name_reporting.enabled Type Boolean Default true Environ variable NEW_RELIC_DATASTORE_TRACER_DATABASE_NAME_REPORTING_ENABLED If false, the agent will not add database_name parameter to transaction or slow sql traces. clear_transaction_state_after_fork Type Boolean Default false Environ variable NEW_RELIC_CLEAR_TRANSACTION_STATE_AFTER_FORK If true, the agent will clear Tracer::State in Agent.drop_buffered_data. exclude_newrelic_header Type Boolean Default false Environ variable NEW_RELIC_EXCLUDE_NEWRELIC_HEADER Allows newrelic distributed tracing headers to be suppressed on outbound requests. infinite_tracing.trace_observer.host Type String Default \"\" Environ variable NEW_RELIC_INFINITE_TRACING_TRACE_OBSERVER_HOST Configures the hostname for the Trace Observer Host. When configured, enables tail-based sampling by sending all recorded spans to a Trace Observer for further sampling decisions, irrespective of any usual agent sampling decision. infinite_tracing.trace_observer.port Type Integer Default 443 Environ variable NEW_RELIC_INFINITE_TRACING_TRACE_OBSERVER_PORT Configures the TCP/IP port for the Trace Observer Host Transaction Tracer The transaction traces feature collects detailed information from a selection of transactions, including a summary of the calling sequence, a breakdown of time spent, and a list of SQL queries and their query plans (on mysql and postgresql). Available features depend on your New Relic subscription level. transaction_tracer.enabled Type Boolean Default true Environ variable NEW_RELIC_TRANSACTION_TRACER_ENABLED If true, enables collection of transaction traces. transaction_tracer.transaction_threshold Type Float Default (Dynamic) Environ variable NEW_RELIC_TRANSACTION_TRACER_TRANSACTION_THRESHOLD Specify a threshold in seconds. Transactions with a duration longer than this threshold are eligible for transaction traces. Specify a float value or the string apdex_f. transaction_tracer.record_sql Type String Default \"obfuscated\" Environ variable NEW_RELIC_TRANSACTION_TRACER_RECORD_SQL Obfuscation level for SQL queries reported in transaction trace nodes. By default, this is set to obfuscated, which strips out the numeric and string literals. If you do not want the agent to capture query information, set this to none. If you want the agent to capture all query information in its original form, set this to raw. When you enable high security mode, this is automatically set to obfuscated. transaction_tracer.record_redis_arguments Type Boolean Default false Environ variable NEW_RELIC_TRANSACTION_TRACER_RECORD_REDIS_ARGUMENTS If true, the agent records Redis command arguments in transaction traces. transaction_tracer.capture_attributes Type Boolean Default true Environ variable NEW_RELIC_TRANSACTION_TRACER_CAPTURE_ATTRIBUTES DEPRECATED Use transaction_tracer.attributes.enabled instead. transaction_tracer.explain_threshold Type Float Default 0.5 Environ variable NEW_RELIC_TRANSACTION_TRACER_EXPLAIN_THRESHOLD Threshold (in seconds) above which the agent will collect explain plans. Relevant only when explain_enabled is true. transaction_tracer.explain_enabled Type Boolean Default true Environ variable NEW_RELIC_TRANSACTION_TRACER_EXPLAIN_ENABLED If true, enables the collection of explain plans in transaction traces. This setting will also apply to explain plans in slow SQL traces if slow_sql.explain_enabled is not set separately. transaction_tracer.stack_trace_threshold Type Float Default 0.5 Environ variable NEW_RELIC_TRANSACTION_TRACER_STACK_TRACE_THRESHOLD Specify a threshold in seconds. The agent includes stack traces in transaction trace nodes when the stack trace duration exceeds this threshold. transaction_tracer.limit_segments Type Integer Default 4000 Environ variable NEW_RELIC_TRANSACTION_TRACER_LIMIT_SEGMENTS Maximum number of transaction trace nodes to record in a single transaction trace. Error Collector The agent collects and reports all uncaught exceptions by default. These configuration options allow you to customize the error collection. For information on ignored and expected errors, see this page on Error Analytics in APM. To set expected errors via the NewRelic::Agent.notice_error Ruby method, consult the Ruby Agent API. error_collector.enabled Type Boolean Default true Environ variable NEW_RELIC_ERROR_COLLECTOR_ENABLED If true, the agent captures traced errors and error count metrics. error_collector.capture_attributes Type Boolean Default true Environ variable NEW_RELIC_ERROR_COLLECTOR_CAPTURE_ATTRIBUTES DEPRECATED Use error_collector.attributes.enabled instead. error_collector.ignore_errors Type String Default \"ActionController::RoutingError,Sinatra::NotFound\" Environ variable NEW_RELIC_ERROR_COLLECTOR_IGNORE_ERRORS DEPRECATED Use error_collector.ignore_classes instead.

      "body": "Browser uses a JavaScript snippet, also referred to as an \"agent,\" to instrument your app's webpages. The JavaScript collects data for browser monitoring. To install the browser agent, you can choose from a number of deployment options. If you don't have one already, create a New Relic account. It's free, forever. Get an account Enable browser monitoring Browser Pro+SPA is the default agent when you enable browser monitoring. This automatically gives you access to all of our browser monitoring features. For more information about the browser monitoring options, see Browser agent types in this document. To enable browser monitoring: Go to one.newrelic.com, select Browser, and then select Add more data. Follow the instructions in the UI to add browser monitoring to your app. Generate some traffic for your app, then wait a few minutes for data to appear in New Relic. Optional: After installation is complete and you are seeing data, go to the App settings page for additional agent configuration, or to change the browser agent type. It may take several minutes after enabling the browser monitoring agent before your webpage data appear in New Relic. If have problems, follow our troubleshooting tips. Deployment options No matter which option you use to deploy browser monitoring, the end result is the same: the browser monitoring JavaScript snippet (also referred to as the \"agent\") is inserted into your app pages. The method you select depends on your preferences and business needs. Enable an APM-monitored app When enabling browser monitoring, you can use an APM agent to automatically inject the browser monitoring JavaScript snippet for you. This is the easiest way to install the agent for an app that's already being monitored by APM. APM-monitored apps are listed on your APM Applications index. Enable with copy/paste When enabling browser monitoring, you can manually insert the JavaScript snippet into your app's webpages. The copy/paste option gives you control over the exact placement of our JavaScript snippet, which is required to monitor the webpage's performance. This is useful for: Standalone apps, static sites, and cached pages delivered by CDN APM apps that are not as closely coupled to the browser app as with a standard server-side app (for example, when your client-side app talks to a REST API back end) Some tips for using the JavaScript snippet: Placement in your webpage: Copy the code snippet, then paste it inline into your pages as close to the top of the <head> element as possible, but after any position-sensitive <meta> tags (for example, X-UA-Compatible or charset information). For more information on the inline head placement, see JavaScript placement requirements. License key and app ID: Near the bottom of the generated JavaScript is your browser license key and application ID. This is useful with the REST API and API Explorer. Instrument webpages using the APM agent This information applies to apps that are also monitored by APM. Our APM agents can instrument webpages with the required JavaScript for page load timing. If you are using an APM agent's API to manually add the JavaScript snippet to your webpages, insert the instrumentation snippet as close to the top as possible. This allows you to take advantage of detailed information about browser's AJAX calls and JavaScript errors. For more information, see the instructions for your APM agent: C SDK Go Java .NET Node.js PHP Python Ruby Use REST API This information applies to apps that are also monitored by APM. The REST API lets you manage deployment outside the browser monitoring UI. This is useful for large organizations deploying multiple apps. Browser agent types: Lite, Pro, Pro+SPA We have three types of browser agents: Lite, Pro, and Pro+SPA. The agent type has no impact on your billing. Browser agent type Comparison Pro+SPA This is the default installed agent when you enable browser monitoring. What it includes: Gives you access to all of the Browser Pro features and to Single Page App (SPA) monitoring. Provides detailed page timing data and the most up-to-date New Relic features, including distributed tracing, for all types of applications. Pro+SPA is not limited only to single page applications. After install, you can downgrade anytime to the less advanced agents if you don't want or need SPA monitoring. Pro What it includes: Gives you access to the Browser Pro features. What it doesn't include: Lacks the functionality designed for single page app monitoring. Lite What it includes: Gives you information about some basic page load timing and browser user information. What it doesn't include: Lacks the Browser Pro features and SPA features. Details about how agent types relate to pricing: New Relic One pricing: This pricing model has data ingest as a billing factor. If you want to reduce data ingest, you may want to consider downgrading to lesser agent types after install. Original pricing: Your access to browser monitoring features is gated by your subscription plan, not by the agent type. This means there is no reason not to use the default Pro+SPA agent. After initial agent installation is finished, you can go to the App settings page to edit your configuration or to change your subscription.",

      "body": "Browser monitoring's JavaScript snippet introduces a nearly invisible impact on website performance and user perception of the time it takes a page to load. The JavaScript is included in a packet of webpage data that is sent anyway. In addition, it immediately begins monitoring for errors and events as the rest of the webpage executes. The negligible amount of overhead required to load the JavaScript results in a significant return of actionable data. Overall impact The JavaScript's overhead takes into consideration both the impact on the user and the impact on your systems' performance: User perception: Typically users cannot detect performance degradations on a website of less than 200ms. Browser's JavaScript adds less than 15ms in aggregated time per page load. This is split up over time, so at no point would a user be able to perceive any performance impact due to the JavaScript. Webserver and systems: Browser app monitoring occurs on the user's browser, not on the server. Processing time does not have an impact on your CPU consumption. In addition, we take additional steps to minimize any potential impact on the apps and webpages being monitored. For example, the \"loader\" script is loaded synchronously in the <HEAD> in order to ensure monitoring is enabled for the entire life cycle of the page. This script is included inline, which eliminates the need for another roundtrip network request to a content delivery network (CDN). The \"loader\" comes with the initial page load. Later in the life cycle of the page, New Relic loads an additional monitoring script asynchronously. This script should not have any perceivable effect to the user and is included in the overall overhead of less than 15ms per page. Network impact Browser monitoring also minimizes network traffic for the end user by aggregating data locally (in the client) and sending it back to New Relic on load, at periodic intervals, on unload, or when data has been collected. (During the browser session's idle periods, transmissions may not be required.) Browser agent scripts The agent consists of two scripts. The first script is inserted inline into the HTML document. The second script is downloaded from the content delivery network (js-agent.newrelic.com) when the window load event happens. Find out about browser agent types here. Script Lite Pro Pro + SPA Inline script size 8.3 KB 22 KB 27 KB Downloaded script size 27 KB 27 KB 38 KB Browser agent harvests Data type Lite Pro Pro + SPA Harvest frequency Page view metrics/events yes yes yes One call. Once the second script is downloaded, we immediately make the first harvest call, which generates page view metrics and the PageView event. This is a JSONP call to bam.nr-data.net or bam-cell.nr-data.net. PageViewTiming events yes yes yes All agent types collect PageViewTiming events. The first harvest happens 10 seconds after the agent initializes, after window load event. After that, we send additional PageViewTiming events every 30 seconds, but only if there's data to send. For information about the event types included in these harvest calls, see the PageViewTiming section of our data dictionary. JavaScriptError metrics/events no yes yes First call when agent initializes; every 60 seconds after that. These calls, sent as metrics data, happen every 60 seconds because we include the Ajax calls that the agent itself makes. This information also applies to Ajax metrics. Ajax metrics no yes yes Sent together with JavaScript errors. Ajax events no yes yes Sent together with BrowserInteraction events. These are collected immediately when an interaction finishes. We only collect interactions for the initial page load and for route changes. We also have an API for generating custom interactions. There will be a separate call for each interaction. Typically, these calls are infrequent because they depend on the user interacting with the page. This information also applies to BrowserInteraction events. Session traces no yes yes First call when agent initializes; after that, every 10 seconds if there is data to send. Session traces send the most data, but they are heavily sampled. Only about 75 page views per hour get enabled to send session trace data. The agent sends data every 10 seconds if it has enough data to send. PageAction events no yes yes First call is made when agent initializes; after that, every 30 seconds if there is data to send. BrowserInteraction events no no yes Sent immediately when an interaction finishes. There will always be at least one interaction that represents the initial page load. Additional interactions are collected only if the URL changes (representing route change). Harvest frequency details for Ajax events apply here as well.",

The value will display approximately 4K bytes of data. InfrastructureEvent oldValue If a change is made to the entity, this attribute contains the old value of the inventory that was changed. This will be blank if no change has been made. InfrastructureEvent provider For integrations that use generic event types (like the DatastoreSample event), the provider value specifies the source of the data (the service, or a sub-category of data from that service). Some Insights events are generic and are used by several integrations. For example, the DatastoreSample event is used by several integrations, including the AWS DynamoDB integration and the AWS RDS integration. In these cases, the provider attribute value represents the source of that attribute. This will usually be the service that data comes from or, for integrations that use several provider values, a certain sub-category of data from that service. When a provider value is present for a generic event, that event will have additional integration-specific attributes attached to it. Here’s an example of an Insights NRQL query that returns the attributes present for a DatastoreSample event reported by the AWS RDS integration: SELECT * from DatastoreSample where provider = 'RdsDbCluster' InfrastructureEvent source The fully specified origin of this inventory item. This is typically in the form category/plugin, where plugin is the generic word used for the tool that gathered this data. InfrastructureEvent summary A summary of the change that happened. Uses a human-friendly string, such as Agent disconnected. InfrastructureEvent violationUpdateType The type of change to the violation: For example: open or closed.

Select an event name in the following table to see its attributes. Event Description PageView PageView tracks geographic and timing data for each browser page load. PageViewTiming PageViewTiming sends each data point as a separate event as soon as it is available. This is useful for asynchronous, dynamic pages. To use this event, you must have browser agent version 1149 or higher. For more information, see the PageViewTiming query examples. PageAction PageAction event tracks data on each action performed on a page. Its attributes provide app and geographic data, as well as data about the user’s browser dimensions, session IDs, and referring and page URLs. BrowserInteraction (SPA) BrowserInteraction contains several PageView attributes as well as attributes that are specific to single-page apps (SPA) AjaxRequest An AjaxRequest event is created any time an Ajax call is made. When an Ajax call happens during a BrowserInteraction event, it is decorated with additional attributes related to the browser interaction. The event attributes track geographic and browser information. BrowserTiming (SPA) BrowserTiming is a custom event that captures SPA timing data for browser interactions started using the custom createTracer SPA API method. BrowserTiming contains many of the same attributes used by other events, especially AjaxRequest. JavaScriptError When a JavaScript error occurs, a JavaScriptError event is created. JavaScriptError captures JavaScript error data as well as browser interaction data. For more information, see the JS errors page in the browser UI and the example NRQL queries for browser and SPA events.

      "body": "You can configure the New Relic Ruby agent with settings in a configuration file, environment variables, or programmatically with server-side configuration. This document summarizes the configuration options available for the Ruby agent. If the default value for a configuration option is (Dynamic), this means the Ruby agent calculates the default at runtime. The value for the config setting defaults to the value of another setting as appropriate. Configuration methods and precedence The primary (default) method to configure the Ruby agent is via the configuration file (newrelic.yml) in the config subdirectory. To set configuration values using environment variables: Add the prefix NEW_RELIC_ to the setting's name. Replace any periods . with underscores _. You can also configure a few values in the UI via server-side configuration. The Ruby agent follows this order of precedence for configuration: Environment variables Server-side configuration Configuration file (newrelic.yml) Default configuration settings In other words, environment variables override all other configuration settings and info, server-side configuration overrides the configuration file and default config settings, and so on. View and edit config file options The Ruby agent's newrelic.yml is a standard YAML configuration file. It typically includes a Defaults section at the top, plus sections below for each application environment; for example, Development, Testing, and Production. The Ruby agent determines which section of the newrelic.yml config file to read from by looking at certain environment variables to derive the application's environment. This can be useful, for example, when you want to use info for the log_level config setting in your production environment, and you want more verbose log_level config settings (such as debug in your development environment. Here is an example newrelic.yml config file: common: &default_settings license_key: 'YOUR_LICENSE_KEY' app_name: 'My Application Name' production: <<: *default_settings log_level: info development: <<: *default_settings log_level: debug Copy For non-Rails apps, the Ruby agent looks for the following environment variables, in this order, to determine the application environment: NEW_RELIC_ENV RUBY_ENV RAILS_ENV APP_ENV RACK_ENV If the Ruby agent does not detect values for any of those environment variables, it will default the application environment to development and read from the development section of the newrelic.yml config file. When running the Ruby agent in a Rails app, the agent first looks for the NEW_RELIC_ENV environment variable to determine the application environment and which section of the newrelic.yml to use. If NEW_RELIC_ENV is not present, the agent uses the Rails environment (RAILS_ENV or RAILS.env, depending on the version of Rails) . When you edit the config file, be sure to: Indent only with two spaces. Indent only where relevant, in stanzas such as error_collector. If you do not indent correctly, the agent may throw an Unable to parse configuration file error on startup. To view the most current list of available Ruby agent configuration options, use the rake newrelic:config:docs command. This document describes the most common options. Update the config file This documentation applies to the Ruby agent's latest release. For details on earlier versions, refer to the comments in newrelic.yml itself. To update newrelic.yml file after a new release, use the template in the base directory of the agent gem. When you update to new gem versions, examine or diff config/newrelic.yml and newrelic.yml in the installation directory to take advantage of new configuration options. Important Updating the gem does not automatically update config/newrelic.yml. General These settings are available for agent configuration. Some settings depend on your New Relic subscription level. license_key Type String Default \"\" Environ variable NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY Your New Relic license key. agent_enabled Type Boolean Default (Dynamic) Environ variable NEW_RELIC_AGENT_ENABLED If true, allows the Ruby agent to run. app_name Type String Default (Dynamic) Environ variable NEW_RELIC_APP_NAME Specify the application name used to aggregate data in the New Relic UI. To report data to multiple apps at the same time, specify a list of names separated by a semicolon ;. For example, MyApp or MyStagingApp;Instance1. monitor_mode Type Boolean Default (Dynamic) Environ variable NEW_RELIC_MONITOR_MODE When true, the agent transmits data about your app to the New Relic collector. log_level Type String Default \"info\" Environ variable NEW_RELIC_LOG_LEVEL Sets the level of detail of log messages. Possible log levels, in increasing verbosity, are: error, warn, info or debug. high_security Type Boolean Default false Environ variable NEW_RELIC_HIGH_SECURITY If true, enables high security mode. Ensure you understand the implications of high security mode before enabling this setting. security_policies_token Type String Default \"\" Environ variable NEW_RELIC_SECURITY_POLICIES_TOKEN Applies Language Agent Security Policy settings. proxy_host Type String Default nil Environ variable NEW_RELIC_PROXY_HOST Defines a host for communicating with the New Relic collector via a proxy server. proxy_port Type Integer Default 8080 Environ variable NEW_RELIC_PROXY_PORT Defines a port for communicating with the New Relic collector via a proxy server. proxy_user Type String Default nil Environ variable NEW_RELIC_PROXY_USER Defines a user for communicating with the New Relic collector via a proxy server. proxy_pass Type String Default nil Environ variable NEW_RELIC_PROXY_PASS Defines a password for communicating with the New Relic collector via a proxy server. capture_params Type Boolean Default false Environ variable NEW_RELIC_CAPTURE_PARAMS When true, the agent captures HTTP request parameters and attaches them to transaction traces, traced errors, and TransactionError events. Caution When using the capture_params setting, the Ruby agent will not attempt to filter secret information. Recommendation: To filter secret information from request parameters, use the attributes.include setting instead. For more information, see the Ruby attribute examples. config_path Type String Default (Dynamic) Environ variable NEW_RELIC_CONFIG_PATH Path to newrelic.yml. If undefined, the agent checks the following directories (in order): config/newrelic.yml, newrelic.yml, $HOME/.newrelic/newrelic.yml and $HOME/newrelic.yml. apdex_t Type Float Default 0.5 Environ variable NEW_RELIC_APDEX_T DEPRECATED For agent versions 3.5.0 or higher, set your Apdex T via the New Relic UI. sync_startup Type Boolean Default false Environ variable NEW_RELIC_SYNC_STARTUP When set to true, forces a synchronous connection to the New Relic collector during application startup. For very short-lived processes, this helps ensure the New Relic agent has time to report. send_data_on_exit Type Boolean Default true Environ variable NEW_RELIC_SEND_DATA_ON_EXIT If true, enables the exit handler that sends data to the New Relic collector before shutting down. timeout Type Integer Default 120 Environ variable NEW_RELIC_TIMEOUT Defines the maximum number of seconds the agent should spend attempting to connect to the collector. force_install_exit_handler Type Boolean Default false Environ variable NEW_RELIC_FORCE_INSTALL_EXIT_HANDLER Forces the exit handler that sends all cached data to collector before shutting down to be installed regardless of detecting scenarios where it generally should not be. Known use-case for this option is where Sinatra is running as an embedded service within another framework and the agent is detecting the Sinatra app and skipping the at_exit handler as a result. Sinatra classically runs the entire application in an at_exit block and would otherwise misbehave if the Agent's at_exit handler was also installed in those circumstances. Note: send_data_on_exit should also be set to true in tandem with this setting. log_file_name Type String Default \"newrelic_agent.log\" Environ variable NEW_RELIC_LOG_FILE_NAME Defines a name for the log file. log_file_path Type String Default \"log/\" Environ variable NEW_RELIC_LOG_FILE_PATH Defines a path to the agent log file, excluding the filename. prepend_active_record_instrumentation Type Boolean Default false Environ variable NEW_RELIC_PREPEND_ACTIVE_RECORD_INSTRUMENTATION If true, uses Module#prepend rather than alias_method for ActiveRecord instrumentation. capture_memcache_keys Type Boolean Default false Environ variable NEW_RELIC_CAPTURE_MEMCACHE_KEYS Enable or disable the capture of memcache keys from transaction traces. message_tracer.segment_parameters.enabled Type Boolean Default true Environ variable NEW_RELIC_MESSAGE_TRACER_SEGMENT_PARAMETERS_ENABLED If true, the agent will collect metadata about messages and attach them as segment parameters. marshaller Type String Default \"json\" Environ variable NEW_RELIC_MARSHALLER Specifies a marshaller for transmitting data to the New Relic collector. Currently json is the only valid value for this setting. backport_fast_active_record_connection_lookup Type Boolean Default false Environ variable NEW_RELIC_BACKPORT_FAST_ACTIVE_RECORD_CONNECTION_LOOKUP Backports the faster ActiveRecord connection lookup introduced in Rails 6, which improves agent performance when instrumenting ActiveRecord. Note that this setting may not be compatible with other gems that patch ActiveRecord. labels Type String Default \"\" Environ variable NEW_RELIC_LABELS A dictionary of label names and values that will be applied to the data sent from this agent. May also be expressed as a semicolon-delimited ; string of colon-separated : pairs. For example, <var>Server</var>:<var>One</var>;<var>Data Center</var>:<var>Primary</var>. ca_bundle_path Type String Default nil Environ variable NEW_RELIC_CA_BUNDLE_PATH Manual override for the path to your local CA bundle. This CA bundle will be used to validate the SSL certificate presented by New Relic's data collection service. datastore_tracer.instance_reporting.enabled Type Boolean Default true Environ variable NEW_RELIC_DATASTORE_TRACER_INSTANCE_REPORTING_ENABLED If false, the agent will not report datastore instance metrics, nor add host or port_path_or_id parameters to transaction or slow SQL traces. datastore_tracer.database_name_reporting.enabled Type Boolean Default true Environ variable NEW_RELIC_DATASTORE_TRACER_DATABASE_NAME_REPORTING_ENABLED If false, the agent will not add database_name parameter to transaction or slow sql traces. clear_transaction_state_after_fork Type Boolean Default false Environ variable NEW_RELIC_CLEAR_TRANSACTION_STATE_AFTER_FORK If true, the agent will clear Tracer::State in Agent.drop_buffered_data. exclude_newrelic_header Type Boolean Default false Environ variable NEW_RELIC_EXCLUDE_NEWRELIC_HEADER Allows newrelic distributed tracing headers to be suppressed on outbound requests. infinite_tracing.trace_observer.host Type String Default \"\" Environ variable NEW_RELIC_INFINITE_TRACING_TRACE_OBSERVER_HOST Configures the hostname for the Trace Observer Host. When configured, enables tail-based sampling by sending all recorded spans to a Trace Observer for further sampling decisions, irrespective of any usual agent sampling decision. infinite_tracing.trace_observer.port Type Integer Default 443 Environ variable NEW_RELIC_INFINITE_TRACING_TRACE_OBSERVER_PORT Configures the TCP/IP port for the Trace Observer Host Transaction Tracer The transaction traces feature collects detailed information from a selection of transactions, including a summary of the calling sequence, a breakdown of time spent, and a list of SQL queries and their query plans (on mysql and postgresql). Available features depend on your New Relic subscription level. transaction_tracer.enabled Type Boolean Default true Environ variable NEW_RELIC_TRANSACTION_TRACER_ENABLED If true, enables collection of transaction traces. transaction_tracer.transaction_threshold Type Float Default (Dynamic) Environ variable NEW_RELIC_TRANSACTION_TRACER_TRANSACTION_THRESHOLD Specify a threshold in seconds. Transactions with a duration longer than this threshold are eligible for transaction traces. Specify a float value or the string apdex_f. transaction_tracer.record_sql Type String Default \"obfuscated\" Environ variable NEW_RELIC_TRANSACTION_TRACER_RECORD_SQL Obfuscation level for SQL queries reported in transaction trace nodes. By default, this is set to obfuscated, which strips out the numeric and string literals. If you do not want the agent to capture query information, set this to none. If you want the agent to capture all query information in its original form, set this to raw. When you enable high security mode, this is automatically set to obfuscated. transaction_tracer.record_redis_arguments Type Boolean Default false Environ variable NEW_RELIC_TRANSACTION_TRACER_RECORD_REDIS_ARGUMENTS If true, the agent records Redis command arguments in transaction traces. transaction_tracer.capture_attributes Type Boolean Default true Environ variable NEW_RELIC_TRANSACTION_TRACER_CAPTURE_ATTRIBUTES DEPRECATED Use transaction_tracer.attributes.enabled instead. transaction_tracer.explain_threshold Type Float Default 0.5 Environ variable NEW_RELIC_TRANSACTION_TRACER_EXPLAIN_THRESHOLD Threshold (in seconds) above which the agent will collect explain plans. Relevant only when explain_enabled is true. transaction_tracer.explain_enabled Type Boolean Default true Environ variable NEW_RELIC_TRANSACTION_TRACER_EXPLAIN_ENABLED If true, enables the collection of explain plans in transaction traces. This setting will also apply to explain plans in slow SQL traces if slow_sql.explain_enabled is not set separately. transaction_tracer.stack_trace_threshold Type Float Default 0.5 Environ variable NEW_RELIC_TRANSACTION_TRACER_STACK_TRACE_THRESHOLD Specify a threshold in seconds. The agent includes stack traces in transaction trace nodes when the stack trace duration exceeds this threshold. transaction_tracer.limit_segments Type Integer Default 4000 Environ variable NEW_RELIC_TRANSACTION_TRACER_LIMIT_SEGMENTS Maximum number of transaction trace nodes to record in a single transaction trace. Error Collector The agent collects and reports all uncaught exceptions by default. These configuration options allow you to customize the error collection. For information on ignored and expected errors, see this page on Error Analytics in APM. To set expected errors via the NewRelic::Agent.notice_error Ruby method, consult the Ruby Agent API. error_collector.enabled Type Boolean Default true Environ variable NEW_RELIC_ERROR_COLLECTOR_ENABLED If true, the agent captures traced errors and error count metrics. error_collector.capture_attributes Type Boolean Default true Environ variable NEW_RELIC_ERROR_COLLECTOR_CAPTURE_ATTRIBUTES DEPRECATED Use error_collector.attributes.enabled instead. error_collector.ignore_errors Type String Default \"ActionController::RoutingError,Sinatra::NotFound\" Environ variable NEW_RELIC_ERROR_COLLECTOR_IGNORE_ERRORS DEPRECATED Use error_collector.ignore_classes instead. Specify a comma-delimited list of error classes that the agent should ignore. Caution Server side configuration takes precedence for this setting over all environment configurations. This differs from all other configuration settings where environment variable take precedence over server side configuration. error_collector.ignore_classes Type Array Default [] Environ variable None A list of error classes that the agent should ignore. Caution This option can't be set via environment variable. error_collector.ignore_messages Type Hash Default {} Environ variable None A map of error classes to a list of messages. When an error of one of the classes specified here occurs, if its error message contains one of the strings corresponding to it here, that error will be ignored. Caution This option can't be set via environment variable. error_collector.ignore_status_codes Type String Default \"\" Environ variable NEW_RELIC_ERROR_COLLECTOR_IGNORE_STATUS_CODES A comma separated list of status codes, possibly including ranges. Errors associated with these status codes, where applicable, will be ignored. error_collector.expected_classes Type Array Default [] Environ variable None A list of error classes that the agent should treat as expected. Caution This option can't be set via environment variable. error_collector.expected_messages Type Hash Default {} Environ variable None A map of error classes to a list of messages. When an error of one of the classes specified here occurs, if its error message contains one of the strings corresponding to it here, that error will be treated as expected. Caution This option can't be set via environment variable. error_collector.expected_status_codes Type String Default \"\" Environ variable NEW_RELIC_ERROR_COLLECTOR_EXPECTED_STATUS_CODES A comma separated list of status codes, possibly including ranges. Errors associated with these status codes, where applicable, will be treated as expected. error_collector.max_backtrace_frames Type Integer Default 50 Environ variable NEW_RELIC_ERROR_COLLECTOR_MAX_BACKTRACE_FRAMES Defines the maximum number of frames in an error backtrace.

      "body": "Browser uses a JavaScript snippet, also referred to as an \"agent,\" to instrument your app's webpages. The JavaScript collects data for browser monitoring. To install the browser agent, you can choose from a number of deployment options. If you don't have one already, create a New Relic account. It's free, forever. Get an account Enable browser monitoring Browser Pro+SPA is the default agent when you enable browser monitoring. This automatically gives you access to all of our browser monitoring features. For more information about the browser monitoring options, see Browser agent types in this document. To enable browser monitoring: Go to one.newrelic.com, select Browser, and then select Add more data. Follow the instructions in the UI to add browser monitoring to your app. Generate some traffic for your app, then wait a few minutes for data to appear in New Relic. Optional: After installation is complete and you are seeing data, go to the App settings page for additional agent configuration, or to change the browser agent type. It may take several minutes after enabling the browser monitoring agent before your webpage data appear in New Relic. If have problems, follow our troubleshooting tips. Deployment options No matter which option you use to deploy browser monitoring, the end result is the same: the browser monitoring JavaScript snippet (also referred to as the \"agent\") is inserted into your app pages. The method you select depends on your preferences and business needs. Enable an APM-monitored app When enabling browser monitoring, you can use an APM agent to automatically inject the browser monitoring JavaScript snippet for you. This is the easiest way to install the agent for an app that's already being monitored by APM. APM-monitored apps are listed on your APM Applications index. Enable with copy/paste When enabling browser monitoring, you can manually insert the JavaScript snippet into your app's webpages. The copy/paste option gives you control over the exact placement of our JavaScript snippet, which is required to monitor the webpage's performance. This is useful for: Standalone apps, static sites, and cached pages delivered by CDN APM apps that are not as closely coupled to the browser app as with a standard server-side app (for example, when your client-side app talks to a REST API back end) Some tips for using the JavaScript snippet: Placement in your webpage: Copy the code snippet, then paste it inline into your pages as close to the top of the <head> element as possible, but after any position-sensitive <meta> tags (for example, X-UA-Compatible or charset information). For more information on the inline head placement, see JavaScript placement requirements. License key and app ID: Near the bottom of the generated JavaScript is your browser license key and application ID. This is useful with the REST API and API Explorer. Instrument webpages using the APM agent This information applies to apps that are also monitored by APM. Our APM agents can instrument webpages with the required JavaScript for page load timing. If you are using an APM agent's API to manually add the JavaScript snippet to your webpages, insert the instrumentation snippet as close to the top as possible. This allows you to take advantage of detailed information about browser's AJAX calls and JavaScript errors. For more information, see the instructions for your APM agent: C SDK Go Java .NET Node.js PHP Python Ruby Use REST API This information applies to apps that are also monitored by APM. The REST API lets you manage deployment outside the browser monitoring UI. This is useful for large organizations deploying multiple apps. Browser agent types: Lite, Pro, Pro+SPA We have three types of browser agents: Lite, Pro, and Pro+SPA. The agent type has no impact on your billing. Browser agent type Comparison Pro+SPA This is the default installed agent when you enable browser monitoring. What it includes: Gives you access to all of the Browser Pro features and to Single Page App (SPA) monitoring. Provides detailed page timing data and the most up-to-date New Relic features, including distributed tracing, for all types of applications. Pro+SPA is not limited only to single page applications. After install, you can downgrade anytime to the less advanced agents if you don't want or need SPA monitoring. Pro What it includes: Gives you access to the Browser Pro features. What it doesn't include: Lacks the functionality designed for single page app monitoring. Lite What it includes: Gives you information about some basic page load timing and browser user information. What it doesn't include: Lacks the Browser Pro features and SPA features. Details about how agent types relate to pricing: New Relic One pricing: This pricing model has data ingest as a billing factor. If you want to reduce data ingest, you may want to consider downgrading to lesser agent types after install. Original pricing: Your access to browser monitoring features is gated by your subscription plan, not by the agent type. This means there is no reason not to use the default Pro+SPA agent. After initial agent installation is finished, you can go to the App settings page to edit your configuration or to change your subscription.",

      "body": "Browser monitoring's JavaScript snippet introduces a nearly invisible impact on website performance and user perception of the time it takes a page to load. The JavaScript is included in a packet of webpage data that is sent anyway. In addition, it immediately begins monitoring for errors and events as the rest of the webpage executes. The negligible amount of overhead required to load the JavaScript results in a significant return of actionable data. Overall impact The JavaScript's overhead takes into consideration both the impact on the user and the impact on your systems' performance: User perception: Typically users cannot detect performance degradations on a website of less than 200ms. Browser's JavaScript adds less than 15ms in aggregated time per page load. This is split up over time, so at no point would a user be able to perceive any performance impact due to the JavaScript. Webserver and systems: Browser app monitoring occurs on the user's browser, not on the server. Processing time does not have an impact on your CPU consumption. In addition, we take additional steps to minimize any potential impact on the apps and webpages being monitored. For example, the \"loader\" script is loaded synchronously in the <HEAD> in order to ensure monitoring is enabled for the entire life cycle of the page. This script is included inline, which eliminates the need for another roundtrip network request to a content delivery network (CDN). The \"loader\" comes with the initial page load. Later in the life cycle of the page, New Relic loads an additional monitoring script asynchronously. This script should not have any perceivable effect to the user and is included in the overall overhead of less than 15ms per page. Network impact Browser monitoring also minimizes network traffic for the end user by aggregating data locally (in the client) and sending it back to New Relic on load, at periodic intervals, on unload, or when data has been collected. (During the browser session's idle periods, transmissions may not be required.) Browser agent scripts The agent consists of two scripts. The first script is inserted inline into the HTML document. The second script is downloaded from the content delivery network (js-agent.newrelic.com) when the window load event happens. Find out about browser agent types here. Script Lite Pro Pro + SPA Inline script size 8.3 KB 22 KB 27 KB Downloaded script size 27 KB 27 KB 38 KB Browser agent harvests Data type Lite Pro Pro + SPA Harvest frequency Page view metrics/events yes yes yes One call. Once the second script is downloaded, we immediately make the first harvest call, which generates page view metrics and the PageView event. This is a JSONP call to bam.nr-data.net or bam-cell.nr-data.net. PageViewTiming events yes yes yes All agent types collect PageViewTiming events. The first harvest happens 10 seconds after the agent initializes, after window load event. After that, we send additional PageViewTiming events every 30 seconds, but only if there's data to send. For information about the event types included in these harvest calls, see the PageViewTiming section of our data dictionary. JavaScriptError metrics/events no yes yes First call when agent initializes; every 60 seconds after that. These calls, sent as metrics data, happen every 60 seconds because we include the Ajax calls that the agent itself makes. This information also applies to Ajax metrics. Ajax metrics no yes yes Sent together with JavaScript errors. Ajax events no yes yes Sent together with BrowserInteraction events. These are collected immediately when an interaction finishes. We only collect interactions for the initial page load and for route changes. We also have an API for generating custom interactions. There will be a separate call for each interaction. Typically, these calls are infrequent because they depend on the user interacting with the page. This information also applies to BrowserInteraction events. Session traces no yes yes First call when agent initializes; after that, every 10 seconds if there is data to send. Session traces send the most data, but they are heavily sampled. Only about 75 page views per hour get enabled to send session trace data. The agent sends data every 10 seconds if it has enough data to send. PageAction events no yes yes First call is made when agent initializes; after that, every 30 seconds if there is data to send. BrowserInteraction events no no yes Sent immediately when an interaction finishes. There will always be at least one interaction that represents the initial page load. Additional interactions are collected only if the URL changes (representing route change). Harvest frequency details for Ajax events apply here as well.",

      "body": "You can configure the New Relic Ruby agent with settings in a configuration file, environment variables, or programmatically with server-side configuration. This document summarizes the configuration options available for the Ruby agent. If the default value for a configuration option is (Dynamic), this means the Ruby agent calculates the default at runtime. The value for the config setting defaults to the value of another setting as appropriate. Configuration methods and precedence The primary (default) method to configure the Ruby agent is via the configuration file (newrelic.yml) in the config subdirectory. To set configuration values using environment variables: Add the prefix NEW_RELIC_ to the setting's name. Replace any periods . with underscores _. You can also configure a few values in the UI via server-side configuration. The Ruby agent follows this order of precedence for configuration: Environment variables Server-side configuration Configuration file (newrelic.yml) Default configuration settings In other words, environment variables override all other configuration settings and info, server-side configuration overrides the configuration file and default config settings, and so on. View and edit config file options The Ruby agent's newrelic.yml is a standard YAML configuration file. It typically includes a Defaults section at the top, plus sections below for each application environment; for example, Development, Testing, and Production. The Ruby agent determines which section of the newrelic.yml config file to read from by looking at certain environment variables to derive the application's environment. This can be useful, for example, when you want to use info for the log_level config setting in your production environment, and you want more verbose log_level config settings (such as debug in your development environment. Here is an example newrelic.yml config file: common: &default_settings license_key: 'YOUR_LICENSE_KEY' app_name: 'My Application Name' production: <<: *default_settings log_level: info development: <<: *default_settings log_level: debug Copy For non-Rails apps, the Ruby agent looks for the following environment variables, in this order, to determine the application environment: NEW_RELIC_ENV RUBY_ENV RAILS_ENV APP_ENV RACK_ENV If the Ruby agent does not detect values for any of those environment variables, it will default the application environment to development and read from the development section of the newrelic.yml config file. When running the Ruby agent in a Rails app, the agent first looks for the NEW_RELIC_ENV environment variable to determine the application environment and which section of the newrelic.yml to use. If NEW_RELIC_ENV is not present, the agent uses the Rails environment (RAILS_ENV or RAILS.env, depending on the version of Rails) . When you edit the config file, be sure to: Indent only with two spaces. Indent only where relevant, in stanzas such as error_collector. If you do not indent correctly, the agent may throw an Unable to parse configuration file error on startup. To view the most current list of available Ruby agent configuration options, use the rake newrelic:config:docs command. This document describes the most common options. Update the config file This documentation applies to the Ruby agent's latest release. For details on earlier versions, refer to the comments in newrelic.yml itself. To update newrelic.yml file after a new release, use the template in the base directory of the agent gem. When you update to new gem versions, examine or diff config/newrelic.yml and newrelic.yml in the installation directory to take advantage of new configuration options. Important Updating the gem does not automatically update config/newrelic.yml. General These settings are available for agent configuration. Some settings depend on your New Relic subscription level. license_key Type String Default \"\" Environ variable NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY Your New Relic license key. agent_enabled Type Boolean Default (Dynamic) Environ variable NEW_RELIC_AGENT_ENABLED If true, allows the Ruby agent to run. app_name Type String Default (Dynamic) Environ variable NEW_RELIC_APP_NAME Specify the application name used to aggregate data in the New Relic UI. To report data to multiple apps at the same time, specify a list of names separated by a semicolon ;. For example, MyApp or MyStagingApp;Instance1. monitor_mode Type Boolean Default (Dynamic) Environ variable NEW_RELIC_MONITOR_MODE When true, the agent transmits data about your app to the New Relic collector. log_level Type String Default \"info\" Environ variable NEW_RELIC_LOG_LEVEL Sets the level of detail of log messages. Possible log levels, in increasing verbosity, are: error, warn, info or debug. high_security Type Boolean Default false Environ variable NEW_RELIC_HIGH_SECURITY If true, enables high security mode. Ensure you understand the implications of high security mode before enabling this setting. security_policies_token Type String Default \"\" Environ variable NEW_RELIC_SECURITY_POLICIES_TOKEN Applies Language Agent Security Policy settings. proxy_host Type String Default nil Environ variable NEW_RELIC_PROXY_HOST Defines a host for communicating with the New Relic collector via a proxy server. proxy_port Type Integer Default 8080 Environ variable NEW_RELIC_PROXY_PORT Defines a port for communicating with the New Relic collector via a proxy server. proxy_user Type String Default nil Environ variable NEW_RELIC_PROXY_USER Defines a user for communicating with the New Relic collector via a proxy server. proxy_pass Type String Default nil Environ variable NEW_RELIC_PROXY_PASS Defines a password for communicating with the New Relic collector via a proxy server. capture_params Type Boolean Default false Environ variable NEW_RELIC_CAPTURE_PARAMS When true, the agent captures HTTP request parameters and attaches them to transaction traces, traced errors, and TransactionError events. Caution When using the capture_params setting, the Ruby agent will not attempt to filter secret information. Recommendation: To filter secret information from request parameters, use the attributes.include setting instead. For more information, see the Ruby attribute examples. config_path Type String Default (Dynamic) Environ variable NEW_RELIC_CONFIG_PATH Path to newrelic.yml. If undefined, the agent checks the following directories (in order): config/newrelic.yml, newrelic.yml, $HOME/.newrelic/newrelic.yml and $HOME/newrelic.yml. apdex_t Type Float Default 0.5 Environ variable NEW_RELIC_APDEX_T DEPRECATED For agent versions 3.5.0 or higher, set your Apdex T via the New Relic UI. sync_startup Type Boolean Default false Environ variable NEW_RELIC_SYNC_STARTUP When set to true, forces a synchronous connection to the New Relic collector during application startup. For very short-lived processes, this helps ensure the New Relic agent has time to report. send_data_on_exit Type Boolean Default true Environ variable NEW_RELIC_SEND_DATA_ON_EXIT If true, enables the exit handler that sends data to the New Relic collector before shutting down. timeout Type Integer Default 120 Environ variable NEW_RELIC_TIMEOUT Defines the maximum number of seconds the agent should spend attempting to connect to the collector. force_install_exit_handler Type Boolean Default false Environ variable NEW_RELIC_FORCE_INSTALL_EXIT_HANDLER Forces the exit handler that sends all cached data to collector before shutting down to be installed regardless of detecting scenarios where it generally should not be. Known use-case for this option is where Sinatra is running as an embedded service within another framework and the agent is detecting the Sinatra app and skipping the at_exit handler as a result. Sinatra classically runs the entire application in an at_exit block and would otherwise misbehave if the Agent's at_exit handler was also installed in those circumstances. Note: send_data_on_exit should also be set to true in tandem with this setting. log_file_name Type String Default \"newrelic_agent.log\" Environ variable NEW_RELIC_LOG_FILE_NAME Defines a name for the log file. log_file_path Type String Default \"log/\" Environ variable NEW_RELIC_LOG_FILE_PATH Defines a path to the agent log file, excluding the filename. prepend_active_record_instrumentation Type Boolean Default false Environ variable NEW_RELIC_PREPEND_ACTIVE_RECORD_INSTRUMENTATION If true, uses Module#prepend rather than alias_method for ActiveRecord instrumentation. capture_memcache_keys Type Boolean Default false Environ variable NEW_RELIC_CAPTURE_MEMCACHE_KEYS Enable or disable the capture of memcache keys from transaction traces. message_tracer.segment_parameters.enabled Type Boolean Default true Environ variable NEW_RELIC_MESSAGE_TRACER_SEGMENT_PARAMETERS_ENABLED If true, the agent will collect metadata about messages and attach them as segment parameters. marshaller Type String Default \"json\" Environ variable NEW_RELIC_MARSHALLER Specifies a marshaller for transmitting data to the New Relic collector. Currently json is the only valid value for this setting. backport_fast_active_record_connection_lookup Type Boolean Default false Environ variable NEW_RELIC_BACKPORT_FAST_ACTIVE_RECORD_CONNECTION_LOOKUP Backports the faster ActiveRecord connection lookup introduced in Rails 6, which improves agent performance when instrumenting ActiveRecord. Note that this setting may not be compatible with other gems that patch ActiveRecord. labels Type String Default \"\" Environ variable NEW_RELIC_LABELS A dictionary of label names and values that will be applied to the data sent from this agent. May also be expressed as a semicolon-delimited ; string of colon-separated : pairs. For example, <var>Server</var>:<var>One</var>;<var>Data Center</var>:<var>Primary</var>. ca_bundle_path Type String Default nil Environ variable NEW_RELIC_CA_BUNDLE_PATH Manual override for the path to your local CA bundle. This CA bundle will be used to validate the SSL certificate presented by New Relic's data collection service. datastore_tracer.instance_reporting.enabled Type Boolean Default true Environ variable NEW_RELIC_DATASTORE_TRACER_INSTANCE_REPORTING_ENABLED If false, the agent will not report datastore instance metrics, nor add host or port_path_or_id parameters to transaction or slow SQL traces. datastore_tracer.database_name_reporting.enabled Type Boolean Default true Environ variable NEW_RELIC_DATASTORE_TRACER_DATABASE_NAME_REPORTING_ENABLED If false, the agent will not add database_name parameter to transaction or slow sql traces. clear_transaction_state_after_fork Type Boolean Default false Environ variable NEW_RELIC_CLEAR_TRANSACTION_STATE_AFTER_FORK If true, the agent will clear Tracer::State in Agent.drop_buffered_data. exclude_newrelic_header Type Boolean Default false Environ variable NEW_RELIC_EXCLUDE_NEWRELIC_HEADER Allows newrelic distributed tracing headers to be suppressed on outbound requests. infinite_tracing.trace_observer.host Type String Default \"\" Environ variable NEW_RELIC_INFINITE_TRACING_TRACE_OBSERVER_HOST Configures the hostname for the Trace Observer Host. When configured, enables tail-based sampling by sending all recorded spans to a Trace Observer for further sampling decisions, irrespective of any usual agent sampling decision. infinite_tracing.trace_observer.port Type Integer Default 443 Environ variable NEW_RELIC_INFINITE_TRACING_TRACE_OBSERVER_PORT Configures the TCP/IP port for the Trace Observer Host Transaction Tracer The transaction traces feature collects detailed information from a selection of transactions, including a summary of the calling sequence, a breakdown of time spent, and a list of SQL queries and their query plans (on mysql and postgresql). Available features depend on your New Relic subscription level. transaction_tracer.enabled Type Boolean Default true Environ variable NEW_RELIC_TRANSACTION_TRACER_ENABLED If true, enables collection of transaction traces. transaction_tracer.transaction_threshold Type Float Default (Dynamic) Environ variable NEW_RELIC_TRANSACTION_TRACER_TRANSACTION_THRESHOLD Specify a threshold in seconds. Transactions with a duration longer than this threshold are eligible for transaction traces. Specify a float value or the string apdex_f. transaction_tracer.record_sql Type String Default \"obfuscated\" Environ variable NEW_RELIC_TRANSACTION_TRACER_RECORD_SQL Obfuscation level for SQL queries reported in transaction trace nodes. By default, this is set to obfuscated, which strips out the numeric and string literals. If you do not want the agent to capture query information, set this to none. If you want the agent to capture all query information in its original form, set this to raw. When you enable high security mode, this is automatically set to obfuscated. transaction_tracer.record_redis_arguments Type Boolean Default false Environ variable NEW_RELIC_TRANSACTION_TRACER_RECORD_REDIS_ARGUMENTS If true, the agent records Redis command arguments in transaction traces. transaction_tracer.capture_attributes Type Boolean Default true Environ variable NEW_RELIC_TRANSACTION_TRACER_CAPTURE_ATTRIBUTES DEPRECATED Use transaction_tracer.attributes.enabled instead. transaction_tracer.explain_threshold Type Float Default 0.5 Environ variable NEW_RELIC_TRANSACTION_TRACER_EXPLAIN_THRESHOLD Threshold (in seconds) above which the agent will collect explain plans. Relevant only when explain_enabled is true. transaction_tracer.explain_enabled Type Boolean Default true Environ variable NEW_RELIC_TRANSACTION_TRACER_EXPLAIN_ENABLED If true, enables the collection of explain plans in transaction traces. This setting will also apply to explain plans in slow SQL traces if slow_sql.explain_enabled is not set separately. transaction_tracer.stack_trace_threshold Type Float Default 0.5 Environ variable NEW_RELIC_TRANSACTION_TRACER_STACK_TRACE_THRESHOLD Specify a threshold in seconds. The agent includes stack traces in transaction trace nodes when the stack trace duration exceeds this threshold. transaction_tracer.limit_segments Type Integer Default 4000 Environ variable NEW_RELIC_TRANSACTION_TRACER_LIMIT_SEGMENTS Maximum number of transaction trace nodes to record in a single transaction trace. Error Collector The agent collects and reports all uncaught exceptions by default. These configuration options allow you to customize the error collection. For information on ignored and expected errors, see this page on Error Analytics in APM. To set expected errors via the NewRelic::Agent.notice_error Ruby method, consult the Ruby Agent API. error_collector.enabled Type Boolean Default true Environ variable NEW_RELIC_ERROR_COLLECTOR_ENABLED If true, the agent captures traced errors and error count metrics. error_collector.capture_attributes Type Boolean Default true Environ variable NEW_RELIC_ERROR_COLLECTOR_CAPTURE_ATTRIBUTES DEPRECATED Use error_collector.attributes.enabled instead. error_collector.ignore_errors Type String Default \"ActionController::RoutingError,Sinatra::NotFound\" Environ variable NEW_RELIC_ERROR_COLLECTOR_IGNORE_ERRORS DEPRECATED Use error_collector.ignore_classes instead. Specify a comma-delimited list of error classes that the agent should ignore. Caution Server side configuration takes precedence for this setting over all environment configurations. This differs from all other configuration settings where environment variable take precedence over server side configuration. error_collector.ignore_classes Type Array Default [] Environ variable None A list of error classes that the agent should ignore. Caution This option can't be set via environment variable. error_collector.ignore_messages Type Hash Default {} Environ variable None A map of error classes to a list of messages. When an error of one of the classes specified here occurs, if its error message contains one of the strings corresponding to it here, that error will be ignored. Caution This option can't be set via environment variable. error_collector.ignore_status_codes Type String Default \"\" Environ variable NEW_RELIC_ERROR_COLLECTOR_IGNORE_STATUS_CODES A comma separated list of status codes, possibly including ranges. Errors associated with these status codes, where applicable, will be ignored. error_collector.expected_classes Type Array Default [] Environ variable None A list of error classes that the agent should treat as expected. Caution This option can't be set via environment variable. error_collector.expected_messages Type Hash Default {} Environ variable None A map of error classes to a list of messages. When an error of one of the classes specified here occurs, if its error message contains one of the strings corresponding to it here, that error will be treated as expected. Caution This option can't be set via environment variable. error_collector.expected_status_codes Type String Default \"\" Environ variable NEW_RELIC_ERROR_COLLECTOR_EXPECTED_STATUS_CODES A comma separated list of status codes, possibly including ranges. Errors associated with these status codes, where applicable, will be treated as expected. error_collector.max_backtrace_frames Type Integer Default 50 Environ variable NEW_RELIC_ERROR_COLLECTOR_MAX_BACKTRACE_FRAMES Defines the maximum number of frames in an error backtrace. Backtraces over this amount are truncated at the beginning and end. error_collector.capture_events Type Boolean Default (Dynamic) Environ variable NEW_RELIC_ERROR_COLLECTOR_CAPTURE_EVENTS If true, the agent collects TransactionError events. error_collector.max_event_samples_stored Type Integer Default 100 Environ variable NEW_RELIC_ERROR_COLLECTOR_MAX_EVENT_SAMPLES_STORED Defines the maximum number of TransactionError events sent to Insights per harvest cycle. Browser Monitoring The browser monitoring page load timing feature (sometimes referred to as real user monitoring or RUM) gives you insight into the performance real users are experiencing with your website. This is accomplished by measuring the time it takes for your users' browsers to download and render your web pages by injecting a small amount of JavaScript code into the header and footer of each page. browser_monitoring.auto_instrument Type Boolean Default (Dynamic) Environ variable NEW_RELIC_BROWSER_MONITORING_AUTO_INSTRUMENT If true, enables auto-injection of the JavaScript header for page load timing (sometimes referred to as real user monitoring or RUM). browser_monitoring.capture_attributes Type Boolean Default false Environ variable NEW_RELIC_BROWSER_MONITORING_CAPTURE_ATTRIBUTES DEPRECATED Use browser_monitoring.attributes.enabled instead. Analytics Events New Relic dashboards is a resource to gather and visualize data about your software and what it says about your business. With it you can quickly and easily create real-time dashboards to get immediate answers about end-user experiences, clickstreams, mobile activities, and server transactions. analytics_events.enabled Type Boolean Default true Environ variable NEW_RELIC_ANALYTICS_EVENTS_ENABLED If true, enables analytics event sampling. analytics_events.max_samples_stored Type Integer Default 1200 Environ variable NEW_RELIC_ANALYTICS_EVENTS_MAX_SAMPLES_STORED Defines the maximum number of request events reported from a single harvest. analytics_events.capture_attributes Type Boolean Default true Environ variable NEW_RELIC_ANALYTICS_EVENTS_CAPTURE_ATTRIBUTES DEPRECATED Use transaction_events.attributes.enabled instead. Attributes Attributes are key-value pairs containing information that determines the properties of an event or transaction. These key-value pairs can be viewed within transaction traces in APM, traced errors in APM, transaction events in dashboards, and page views in dashboards. You can customize exactly which attributes will be sent to each of these destinations attributes.enabled Type Boolean Default true Environ variable NEW_RELIC_ATTRIBUTES_ENABLED If true, enables capture of attributes for all destinations. transaction_tracer.attributes.enabled Type Boolean Default (Dynamic) Environ variable NEW_RELIC_TRANSACTION_TRACER_ATTRIBUTES_ENABLED If true, the agent captures attributes from transaction traces. transaction_events.attributes.enabled Type Boolean Default (Dynamic) Environ variable NEW_RELIC_TRANSACTION_EVENTS_ATTRIBUTES_ENABLED If true, the agent captures attributes from transaction events. error_collector.attributes.enabled Type Boolean Default (Dynamic) Environ variable NEW_RELIC_ERROR_COLLECTOR_ATTRIBUTES_ENABLED If true, the agent captures attributes from error collection. browser_monitoring.attributes.enabled Type Boolean Default (Dynamic) Environ variable NEW_RELIC_BROWSER_MONITORING_ATTRIBUTES_ENABLED If true, the agent captures attributes from browser monitoring. span_events.attributes.enabled Type Boolean Default true Environ variable NEW_RELIC_SPAN_EVENTS_ATTRIBUTES_ENABLED If true, the agent captures attributes on span events. transaction_segments.attributes.enabled Type Boolean Default true Environ variable NEW_RELIC_TRANSACTION_SEGMENTS_ATTRIBUTES_ENABLED If true, the agent captures attributes on transaction segments. attributes.exclude Type Array Default [] Environ variable NEW_RELIC_ATTRIBUTES_EXCLUDE Prefix of attributes to exclude from all destinations.

      "body": "Browser uses a JavaScript snippet, also referred to as an \"agent,\" to instrument your app's webpages. The JavaScript collects data for browser monitoring. To install the browser agent, you can choose from a number of deployment options. If you don't have one already, create a New Relic account. It's free, forever. Get an account Enable browser monitoring Browser Pro+SPA is the default agent when you enable browser monitoring. This automatically gives you access to all of our browser monitoring features. For more information about the browser monitoring options, see Browser agent types in this document. To enable browser monitoring: Go to one.newrelic.com, select Browser, and then select Add more data. Follow the instructions in the UI to add browser monitoring to your app. Generate some traffic for your app, then wait a few minutes for data to appear in New Relic. Optional: After installation is complete and you are seeing data, go to the App settings page for additional agent configuration, or to change the browser agent type. It may take several minutes after enabling the browser monitoring agent before your webpage data appear in New Relic. If have problems, follow our troubleshooting tips. Deployment options No matter which option you use to deploy browser monitoring, the end result is the same: the browser monitoring JavaScript snippet (also referred to as the \"agent\") is inserted into your app pages. The method you select depends on your preferences and business needs. Enable an APM-monitored app When enabling browser monitoring, you can use an APM agent to automatically inject the browser monitoring JavaScript snippet for you. This is the easiest way to install the agent for an app that's already being monitored by APM. APM-monitored apps are listed on your APM Applications index. Enable with copy/paste When enabling browser monitoring, you can manually insert the JavaScript snippet into your app's webpages. The copy/paste option gives you control over the exact placement of our JavaScript snippet, which is required to monitor the webpage's performance. This is useful for: Standalone apps, static sites, and cached pages delivered by CDN APM apps that are not as closely coupled to the browser app as with a standard server-side app (for example, when your client-side app talks to a REST API back end) Some tips for using the JavaScript snippet: Placement in your webpage: Copy the code snippet, then paste it inline into your pages as close to the top of the <head> element as possible, but after any position-sensitive <meta> tags (for example, X-UA-Compatible or charset information). For more information on the inline head placement, see JavaScript placement requirements. License key and app ID: Near the bottom of the generated JavaScript is your browser license key and application ID. This is useful with the REST API and API Explorer. Instrument webpages using the APM agent This information applies to apps that are also monitored by APM. Our APM agents can instrument webpages with the required JavaScript for page load timing. If you are using an APM agent's API to manually add the JavaScript snippet to your webpages, insert the instrumentation snippet as close to the top as possible. This allows you to take advantage of detailed information about browser's AJAX calls and JavaScript errors. For more information, see the instructions for your APM agent: C SDK Go Java .NET Node.js PHP Python Ruby Use REST API This information applies to apps that are also monitored by APM. The REST API lets you manage deployment outside the browser monitoring UI. This is useful for large organizations deploying multiple apps. Browser agent types: Lite, Pro, Pro+SPA We have three types of browser agents: Lite, Pro, and Pro+SPA. The agent type has no impact on your billing. Browser agent type Comparison Pro+SPA This is the default installed agent when you enable browser monitoring. What it includes: Gives you access to all of the Browser Pro features and to Single Page App (SPA) monitoring. Provides detailed page timing data and the most up-to-date New Relic features, including distributed tracing, for all types of applications. Pro+SPA is not limited only to single page applications. After install, you can downgrade anytime to the less advanced agents if you don't want or need SPA monitoring. Pro What it includes: Gives you access to the Browser Pro features. What it doesn't include: Lacks the functionality designed for single page app monitoring. Lite What it includes: Gives you information about some basic page load timing and browser user information. What it doesn't include: Lacks the Browser Pro features and SPA features. Details about how agent types relate to pricing: New Relic One pricing: This pricing model has data ingest as a billing factor. If you want to reduce data ingest, you may want to consider downgrading to lesser agent types after install. Original pricing: Your access to browser monitoring features is gated by your subscription plan, not by the agent type. This means there is no reason not to use the default Pro+SPA agent. After initial agent installation is finished, you can go to the App settings page to edit your configuration or to change your subscription.",

      "body": "Browser monitoring's JavaScript snippet introduces a nearly invisible impact on website performance and user perception of the time it takes a page to load. The JavaScript is included in a packet of webpage data that is sent anyway. In addition, it immediately begins monitoring for errors and events as the rest of the webpage executes. The negligible amount of overhead required to load the JavaScript results in a significant return of actionable data. Overall impact The JavaScript's overhead takes into consideration both the impact on the user and the impact on your systems' performance: User perception: Typically users cannot detect performance degradations on a website of less than 200ms. Browser's JavaScript adds less than 15ms in aggregated time per page load. This is split up over time, so at no point would a user be able to perceive any performance impact due to the JavaScript. Webserver and systems: Browser app monitoring occurs on the user's browser, not on the server. Processing time does not have an impact on your CPU consumption. In addition, we take additional steps to minimize any potential impact on the apps and webpages being monitored. For example, the \"loader\" script is loaded synchronously in the <HEAD> in order to ensure monitoring is enabled for the entire life cycle of the page. This script is included inline, which eliminates the need for another roundtrip network request to a content delivery network (CDN). The \"loader\" comes with the initial page load. Later in the life cycle of the page, New Relic loads an additional monitoring script asynchronously. This script should not have any perceivable effect to the user and is included in the overall overhead of less than 15ms per page. Network impact Browser monitoring also minimizes network traffic for the end user by aggregating data locally (in the client) and sending it back to New Relic on load, at periodic intervals, on unload, or when data has been collected. (During the browser session's idle periods, transmissions may not be required.) Browser agent scripts The agent consists of two scripts. The first script is inserted inline into the HTML document. The second script is downloaded from the content delivery network (js-agent.newrelic.com) when the window load event happens. Find out about browser agent types here. Script Lite Pro Pro + SPA Inline script size 8.3 KB 22 KB 27 KB Downloaded script size 27 KB 27 KB 38 KB Browser agent harvests Data type Lite Pro Pro + SPA Harvest frequency Page view metrics/events yes yes yes One call. Once the second script is downloaded, we immediately make the first harvest call, which generates page view metrics and the PageView event. This is a JSONP call to bam.nr-data.net or bam-cell.nr-data.net. PageViewTiming events yes yes yes All agent types collect PageViewTiming events. The first harvest happens 10 seconds after the agent initializes, after window load event. After that, we send additional PageViewTiming events every 30 seconds, but only if there's data to send. For information about the event types included in these harvest calls, see the PageViewTiming section of our data dictionary. JavaScriptError metrics/events no yes yes First call when agent initializes; every 60 seconds after that. These calls, sent as metrics data, happen every 60 seconds because we include the Ajax calls that the agent itself makes. This information also applies to Ajax metrics. Ajax metrics no yes yes Sent together with JavaScript errors. Ajax events no yes yes Sent together with BrowserInteraction events. These are collected immediately when an interaction finishes. We only collect interactions for the initial page load and for route changes. We also have an API for generating custom interactions. There will be a separate call for each interaction. Typically, these calls are infrequent because they depend on the user interacting with the page. This information also applies to BrowserInteraction events. Session traces no yes yes First call when agent initializes; after that, every 10 seconds if there is data to send. Session traces send the most data, but they are heavily sampled. Only about 75 page views per hour get enabled to send session trace data. The agent sends data every 10 seconds if it has enough data to send. PageAction events no yes yes First call is made when agent initializes; after that, every 30 seconds if there is data to send. BrowserInteraction events no no yes Sent immediately when an interaction finishes. There will always be at least one interaction that represents the initial page load. Additional interactions are collected only if the URL changes (representing route change). Harvest frequency details for Ajax events apply here as well.",

      "body": "You can configure the New Relic Ruby agent with settings in a configuration file, environment variables, or programmatically with server-side configuration. This document summarizes the configuration options available for the Ruby agent. If the default value for a configuration option is (Dynamic), this means the Ruby agent calculates the default at runtime. The value for the config setting defaults to the value of another setting as appropriate. Configuration methods and precedence The primary (default) method to configure the Ruby agent is via the configuration file (newrelic.yml) in the config subdirectory. To set configuration values using environment variables: Add the prefix NEW_RELIC_ to the setting's name. Replace any periods . with underscores _. You can also configure a few values in the UI via server-side configuration. The Ruby agent follows this order of precedence for configuration: Environment variables Server-side configuration Configuration file (newrelic.yml) Default configuration settings In other words, environment variables override all other configuration settings and info, server-side configuration overrides the configuration file and default config settings, and so on. View and edit config file options The Ruby agent's newrelic.yml is a standard YAML configuration file. It typically includes a Defaults section at the top, plus sections below for each application environment; for example, Development, Testing, and Production. The Ruby agent determines which section of the newrelic.yml config file to read from by looking at certain environment variables to derive the application's environment. This can be useful, for example, when you want to use info for the log_level config setting in your production environment, and you want more verbose log_level config settings (such as debug in your development environment. Here is an example newrelic.yml config file: common: &default_settings license_key: 'YOUR_LICENSE_KEY' app_name: 'My Application Name' production: <<: *default_settings log_level: info development: <<: *default_settings log_level: debug Copy For non-Rails apps, the Ruby agent looks for the following environment variables, in this order, to determine the application environment: NEW_RELIC_ENV RUBY_ENV RAILS_ENV APP_ENV RACK_ENV If the Ruby agent does not detect values for any of those environment variables, it will default the application environment to development and read from the development section of the newrelic.yml config file. When running the Ruby agent in a Rails app, the agent first looks for the NEW_RELIC_ENV environment variable to determine the application environment and which section of the newrelic.yml to use. If NEW_RELIC_ENV is not present, the agent uses the Rails environment (RAILS_ENV or RAILS.env, depending on the version of Rails) . When you edit the config file, be sure to: Indent only with two spaces. Indent only where relevant, in stanzas such as error_collector. If you do not indent correctly, the agent may throw an Unable to parse configuration file error on startup. To view the most current list of available Ruby agent configuration options, use the rake newrelic:config:docs command. This document describes the most common options. Update the config file This documentation applies to the Ruby agent's latest release. For details on earlier versions, refer to the comments in newrelic.yml itself. To update newrelic.yml file after a new release, use the template in the base directory of the agent gem. When you update to new gem versions, examine or diff config/newrelic.yml and newrelic.yml in the installation directory to take advantage of new configuration options. Important Updating the gem does not automatically update config/newrelic.yml. General These settings are available for agent configuration. Some settings depend on your New Relic subscription level. license_key Type String Default \"\" Environ variable NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY Your New Relic license key. agent_enabled Type Boolean Default (Dynamic) Environ variable NEW_RELIC_AGENT_ENABLED If true, allows the Ruby agent to run. app_name Type String Default (Dynamic) Environ variable NEW_RELIC_APP_NAME Specify the application name used to aggregate data in the New Relic UI. To report data to multiple apps at the same time, specify a list of names separated by a semicolon ;. For example, MyApp or MyStagingApp;Instance1. monitor_mode Type Boolean Default (Dynamic) Environ variable NEW_RELIC_MONITOR_MODE When true, the agent transmits data about your app to the New Relic collector. log_level Type String Default \"info\" Environ variable NEW_RELIC_LOG_LEVEL Sets the level of detail of log messages. Possible log levels, in increasing verbosity, are: error, warn, info or debug. high_security Type Boolean Default false Environ variable NEW_RELIC_HIGH_SECURITY If true, enables high security mode. Ensure you understand the implications of high security mode before enabling this setting. security_policies_token Type String Default \"\" Environ variable NEW_RELIC_SECURITY_POLICIES_TOKEN Applies Language Agent Security Policy settings. proxy_host Type String Default nil Environ variable NEW_RELIC_PROXY_HOST Defines a host for communicating with the New Relic collector via a proxy server. proxy_port Type Integer Default 8080 Environ variable NEW_RELIC_PROXY_PORT Defines a port for communicating with the New Relic collector via a proxy server. proxy_user Type String Default nil Environ variable NEW_RELIC_PROXY_USER Defines a user for communicating with the New Relic collector via a proxy server. proxy_pass Type String Default nil Environ variable NEW_RELIC_PROXY_PASS Defines a password for communicating with the New Relic collector via a proxy server. capture_params Type Boolean Default false Environ variable NEW_RELIC_CAPTURE_PARAMS When true, the agent captures HTTP request parameters and attaches them to transaction traces, traced errors, and TransactionError events. Caution When using the capture_params setting, the Ruby agent will not attempt to filter secret information. Recommendation: To filter secret information from request parameters, use the attributes.include setting instead. For more information, see the Ruby attribute examples. config_path Type String Default (Dynamic) Environ variable NEW_RELIC_CONFIG_PATH Path to newrelic.yml. If undefined, the agent checks the following directories (in order): config/newrelic.yml, newrelic.yml, $HOME/.newrelic/newrelic.yml and $HOME/newrelic.yml. apdex_t Type Float Default 0.5 Environ variable NEW_RELIC_APDEX_T DEPRECATED For agent versions 3.5.0 or higher, set your Apdex T via the New Relic UI. sync_startup Type Boolean Default false Environ variable NEW_RELIC_SYNC_STARTUP When set to true, forces a synchronous connection to the New Relic collector during application startup. For very short-lived processes, this helps ensure the New Relic agent has time to report. send_data_on_exit Type Boolean Default true Environ variable NEW_RELIC_SEND_DATA_ON_EXIT If true, enables the exit handler that sends data to the New Relic collector before shutting down. timeout Type Integer Default 120 Environ variable NEW_RELIC_TIMEOUT Defines the maximum number of seconds the agent should spend attempting to connect to the collector. force_install_exit_handler Type Boolean Default false Environ variable NEW_RELIC_FORCE_INSTALL_EXIT_HANDLER Forces the exit handler that sends all cached data to collector before shutting down to be installed regardless of detecting scenarios where it generally should not be. Known use-case for this option is where Sinatra is running as an embedded service within another framework and the agent is detecting the Sinatra app and skipping the at_exit handler as a result. Sinatra classically runs the entire application in an at_exit block and would otherwise misbehave if the Agent's at_exit handler was also installed in those circumstances. Note: send_data_on_exit should also be set to true in tandem with this setting. log_file_name Type String Default \"newrelic_agent.log\" Environ variable NEW_RELIC_LOG_FILE_NAME Defines a name for the log file. log_file_path Type String Default \"log/\" Environ variable NEW_RELIC_LOG_FILE_PATH Defines a path to the agent log file, excluding the filename. prepend_active_record_instrumentation Type Boolean Default false Environ variable NEW_RELIC_PREPEND_ACTIVE_RECORD_INSTRUMENTATION If true, uses Module#prepend rather than alias_method for ActiveRecord instrumentation. capture_memcache_keys Type Boolean Default false Environ variable NEW_RELIC_CAPTURE_MEMCACHE_KEYS Enable or disable the capture of memcache keys from transaction traces. message_tracer.segment_parameters.enabled Type Boolean Default true Environ variable NEW_RELIC_MESSAGE_TRACER_SEGMENT_PARAMETERS_ENABLED If true, the agent will collect metadata about messages and attach them as segment parameters. marshaller Type String Default \"json\" Environ variable NEW_RELIC_MARSHALLER Specifies a marshaller for transmitting data to the New Relic collector. Currently json is the only valid value for this setting. backport_fast_active_record_connection_lookup Type Boolean Default false Environ variable NEW_RELIC_BACKPORT_FAST_ACTIVE_RECORD_CONNECTION_LOOKUP Backports the faster ActiveRecord connection lookup introduced in Rails 6, which improves agent performance when instrumenting ActiveRecord. Note that this setting may not be compatible with other gems that patch ActiveRecord. labels Type String Default \"\" Environ variable NEW_RELIC_LABELS A dictionary of label names and values that will be applied to the data sent from this agent. May also be expressed as a semicolon-delimited ; string of colon-separated : pairs. For example, <var>Server</var>:<var>One</var>;<var>Data Center</var>:<var>Primary</var>. ca_bundle_path Type String Default nil Environ variable NEW_RELIC_CA_BUNDLE_PATH Manual override for the path to your local CA bundle. This CA bundle will be used to validate the SSL certificate presented by New Relic's data collection service. datastore_tracer.instance_reporting.enabled Type Boolean Default true Environ variable NEW_RELIC_DATASTORE_TRACER_INSTANCE_REPORTING_ENABLED If false, the agent will not report datastore instance metrics, nor add host or port_path_or_id parameters to transaction or slow SQL traces. datastore_tracer.database_name_reporting.enabled Type Boolean Default true Environ variable NEW_RELIC_DATASTORE_TRACER_DATABASE_NAME_REPORTING_ENABLED If false, the agent will not add database_name parameter to transaction or slow sql traces. clear_transaction_state_after_fork Type Boolean Default false Environ variable NEW_RELIC_CLEAR_TRANSACTION_STATE_AFTER_FORK If true, the agent will clear Tracer::State in Agent.drop_buffered_data. exclude_newrelic_header Type Boolean Default false Environ variable NEW_RELIC_EXCLUDE_NEWRELIC_HEADER Allows newrelic distributed tracing headers to be suppressed on outbound requests. infinite_tracing.trace_observer.host Type String Default \"\" Environ variable NEW_RELIC_INFINITE_TRACING_TRACE_OBSERVER_HOST Configures the hostname for the Trace Observer Host. When configured, enables tail-based sampling by sending all recorded spans to a Trace Observer for further sampling decisions, irrespective of any usual agent sampling decision. infinite_tracing.trace_observer.port Type Integer Default 443 Environ variable NEW_RELIC_INFINITE_TRACING_TRACE_OBSERVER_PORT Configures the TCP/IP port for the Trace Observer Host Transaction Tracer The transaction traces feature collects detailed information from a selection of transactions, including a summary of the calling sequence, a breakdown of time spent, and a list of SQL queries and their query plans (on mysql and postgresql). Available features depend on your New Relic subscription level. transaction_tracer.enabled Type Boolean Default true Environ variable NEW_RELIC_TRANSACTION_TRACER_ENABLED If true, enables collection of transaction traces. transaction_tracer.transaction_threshold Type Float Default (Dynamic) Environ variable NEW_RELIC_TRANSACTION_TRACER_TRANSACTION_THRESHOLD Specify a threshold in seconds. Transactions with a duration longer than this threshold are eligible for transaction traces. Specify a float value or the string apdex_f. transaction_tracer.record_sql Type String Default \"obfuscated\" Environ variable NEW_RELIC_TRANSACTION_TRACER_RECORD_SQL Obfuscation level for SQL queries reported in transaction trace nodes. By default, this is set to obfuscated, which strips out the numeric and string literals. If you do not want the agent to capture query information, set this to none. If you want the agent to capture all query information in its original form, set this to raw. When you enable high security mode, this is automatically set to obfuscated. transaction_tracer.record_redis_arguments Type Boolean Default false Environ variable NEW_RELIC_TRANSACTION_TRACER_RECORD_REDIS_ARGUMENTS If true, the agent records Redis command arguments in transaction traces. transaction_tracer.capture_attributes Type Boolean Default true Environ variable NEW_RELIC_TRANSACTION_TRACER_CAPTURE_ATTRIBUTES DEPRECATED Use transaction_tracer.attributes.enabled instead. transaction_tracer.explain_threshold Type Float Default 0.5 Environ variable NEW_RELIC_TRANSACTION_TRACER_EXPLAIN_THRESHOLD Threshold (in seconds) above which the agent will collect explain plans. Relevant only when explain_enabled is true. transaction_tracer.explain_enabled Type Boolean Default true Environ variable NEW_RELIC_TRANSACTION_TRACER_EXPLAIN_ENABLED If true, enables the collection of explain plans in transaction traces. This setting will also apply to explain plans in slow SQL traces if slow_sql.explain_enabled is not set separately. transaction_tracer.stack_trace_threshold Type Float Default 0.5 Environ variable NEW_RELIC_TRANSACTION_TRACER_STACK_TRACE_THRESHOLD Specify a threshold in seconds. The agent includes stack traces in transaction trace nodes when the stack trace duration exceeds this threshold. transaction_tracer.limit_segments Type Integer Default 4000 Environ variable NEW_RELIC_TRANSACTION_TRACER_LIMIT_SEGMENTS Maximum number of transaction trace nodes to record in a single transaction trace. Error Collector The agent collects and reports all uncaught exceptions by default. These configuration options allow you to customize the error collection. For information on ignored and expected errors, see this page on Error Analytics in APM. To set expected errors via the NewRelic::Agent.notice_error Ruby method, consult the Ruby Agent API. error_collector.enabled Type Boolean Default true Environ variable NEW_RELIC_ERROR_COLLECTOR_ENABLED If true, the agent captures traced errors and error count metrics. error_collector.capture_attributes Type Boolean Default true Environ variable NEW_RELIC_ERROR_COLLECTOR_CAPTURE_ATTRIBUTES DEPRECATED Use error_collector.attributes.enabled instead. error_collector.ignore_errors Type String Default \"ActionController::RoutingError,Sinatra::NotFound\" Environ variable NEW_RELIC_ERROR_COLLECTOR_IGNORE_ERRORS DEPRECATED Use error_collector.ignore_classes instead. Specify a comma-delimited list of error classes that the agent should ignore. Caution Server side configuration takes precedence for this setting over all environment configurations. This differs from all other configuration settings where environment variable take precedence over server side configuration. error_collector.ignore_classes Type Array Default [] Environ variable None A list of error classes that the agent should ignore. Caution This option can't be set via environment variable. error_collector.ignore_messages Type Hash Default {} Environ variable None A map of error classes to a list of messages. When an error of one of the classes specified here occurs, if its error message contains one of the strings corresponding to it here, that error will be ignored. Caution This option can't be set via environment variable. error_collector.ignore_status_codes Type String Default \"\" Environ variable NEW_RELIC_ERROR_COLLECTOR_IGNORE_STATUS_CODES A comma separated list of status codes, possibly including ranges. Errors associated with these status codes, where applicable, will be ignored. error_collector.expected_classes Type Array Default [] Environ variable None A list of error classes that the agent should treat as expected. Caution This option can't be set via environment variable. error_collector.expected_messages Type Hash Default {} Environ variable None A map of error classes to a list of messages. When an error of one of the classes specified here occurs, if its error message contains one of the strings corresponding to it here, that error will be treated as expected. Caution This option can't be set via environment variable. error_collector.expected_status_codes Type String Default \"\" Environ variable NEW_RELIC_ERROR_COLLECTOR_EXPECTED_STATUS_CODES A comma separated list of status codes, possibly including ranges. Errors associated with these status codes, where applicable, will be treated as expected. error_collector.max_backtrace_frames Type Integer Default 50 Environ variable NEW_RELIC_ERROR_COLLECTOR_MAX_BACKTRACE_FRAMES Defines the maximum number of frames in an error backtrace. Backtraces over this amount are truncated at the beginning and end. error_collector.capture_events Type Boolean Default (Dynamic) Environ variable NEW_RELIC_ERROR_COLLECTOR_CAPTURE_EVENTS If true, the agent collects TransactionError events. error_collector.max_event_samples_stored Type Integer Default 100 Environ variable NEW_RELIC_ERROR_COLLECTOR_MAX_EVENT_SAMPLES_STORED Defines the maximum number of TransactionError events sent to Insights per harvest cycle. Browser Monitoring The browser monitoring page load timing feature (sometimes referred to as real user monitoring or RUM) gives you insight into the performance real users are experiencing with your website.

      "body": "Browser uses a JavaScript snippet, also referred to as an \"agent,\" to instrument your app's webpages. The JavaScript collects data for browser monitoring. To install the browser agent, you can choose from a number of deployment options. If you don't have one already, create a New Relic account. It's free, forever. Get an account Enable browser monitoring Browser Pro+SPA is the default agent when you enable browser monitoring. This automatically gives you access to all of our browser monitoring features. For more information about the browser monitoring options, see Browser agent types in this document. To enable browser monitoring: Go to one.newrelic.com, select Browser, and then select Add more data. Follow the instructions in the UI to add browser monitoring to your app. Generate some traffic for your app, then wait a few minutes for data to appear in New Relic. Optional: After installation is complete and you are seeing data, go to the App settings page for additional agent configuration, or to change the browser agent type. It may take several minutes after enabling the browser monitoring agent before your webpage data appear in New Relic. If have problems, follow our troubleshooting tips. Deployment options No matter which option you use to deploy browser monitoring, the end result is the same: the browser monitoring JavaScript snippet (also referred to as the \"agent\") is inserted into your app pages. The method you select depends on your preferences and business needs. Enable an APM-monitored app When enabling browser monitoring, you can use an APM agent to automatically inject the browser monitoring JavaScript snippet for you. This is the easiest way to install the agent for an app that's already being monitored by APM. APM-monitored apps are listed on your APM Applications index. Enable with copy/paste When enabling browser monitoring, you can manually insert the JavaScript snippet into your app's webpages. The copy/paste option gives you control over the exact placement of our JavaScript snippet, which is required to monitor the webpage's performance. This is useful for: Standalone apps, static sites, and cached pages delivered by CDN APM apps that are not as closely coupled to the browser app as with a standard server-side app (for example, when your client-side app talks to a REST API back end) Some tips for using the JavaScript snippet: Placement in your webpage: Copy the code snippet, then paste it inline into your pages as close to the top of the <head> element as possible, but after any position-sensitive <meta> tags (for example, X-UA-Compatible or charset information). For more information on the inline head placement, see JavaScript placement requirements. License key and app ID: Near the bottom of the generated JavaScript is your browser license key and application ID. This is useful with the REST API and API Explorer. Instrument webpages using the APM agent This information applies to apps that are also monitored by APM. Our APM agents can instrument webpages with the required JavaScript for page load timing. If you are using an APM agent's API to manually add the JavaScript snippet to your webpages, insert the instrumentation snippet as close to the top as possible. This allows you to take advantage of detailed information about browser's AJAX calls and JavaScript errors. For more information, see the instructions for your APM agent: C SDK Go Java .NET Node.js PHP Python Ruby Use REST API This information applies to apps that are also monitored by APM. The REST API lets you manage deployment outside the browser monitoring UI. This is useful for large organizations deploying multiple apps. Browser agent types: Lite, Pro, Pro+SPA We have three types of browser agents: Lite, Pro, and Pro+SPA. The agent type has no impact on your billing. Browser agent type Comparison Pro+SPA This is the default installed agent when you enable browser monitoring. What it includes: Gives you access to all of the Browser Pro features and to Single Page App (SPA) monitoring. Provides detailed page timing data and the most up-to-date New Relic features, including distributed tracing, for all types of applications. Pro+SPA is not limited only to single page applications. After install, you can downgrade anytime to the less advanced agents if you don't want or need SPA monitoring. Pro What it includes: Gives you access to the Browser Pro features. What it doesn't include: Lacks the functionality designed for single page app monitoring. Lite What it includes: Gives you information about some basic page load timing and browser user information. What it doesn't include: Lacks the Browser Pro features and SPA features. Details about how agent types relate to pricing: New Relic One pricing: This pricing model has data ingest as a billing factor. If you want to reduce data ingest, you may want to consider downgrading to lesser agent types after install. Original pricing: Your access to browser monitoring features is gated by your subscription plan, not by the agent type. This means there is no reason not to use the default Pro+SPA agent. After initial agent installation is finished, you can go to the App settings page to edit your configuration or to change your subscription.",

      "body": "Browser monitoring's JavaScript snippet introduces a nearly invisible impact on website performance and user perception of the time it takes a page to load. The JavaScript is included in a packet of webpage data that is sent anyway. In addition, it immediately begins monitoring for errors and events as the rest of the webpage executes. The negligible amount of overhead required to load the JavaScript results in a significant return of actionable data. Overall impact The JavaScript's overhead takes into consideration both the impact on the user and the impact on your systems' performance: User perception: Typically users cannot detect performance degradations on a website of less than 200ms. Browser's JavaScript adds less than 15ms in aggregated time per page load. This is split up over time, so at no point would a user be able to perceive any performance impact due to the JavaScript. Webserver and systems: Browser app monitoring occurs on the user's browser, not on the server. Processing time does not have an impact on your CPU consumption. In addition, we take additional steps to minimize any potential impact on the apps and webpages being monitored. For example, the \"loader\" script is loaded synchronously in the <HEAD> in order to ensure monitoring is enabled for the entire life cycle of the page. This script is included inline, which eliminates the need for another roundtrip network request to a content delivery network (CDN). The \"loader\" comes with the initial page load. Later in the life cycle of the page, New Relic loads an additional monitoring script asynchronously. This script should not have any perceivable effect to the user and is included in the overall overhead of less than 15ms per page. Network impact Browser monitoring also minimizes network traffic for the end user by aggregating data locally (in the client) and sending it back to New Relic on load, at periodic intervals, on unload, or when data has been collected. (During the browser session's idle periods, transmissions may not be required.) Browser agent scripts The agent consists of two scripts. The first script is inserted inline into the HTML document. The second script is downloaded from the content delivery network (js-agent.newrelic.com) when the window load event happens. Find out about browser agent types here. Script Lite Pro Pro + SPA Inline script size 8.3 KB 22 KB 27 KB Downloaded script size 27 KB 27 KB 38 KB Browser agent harvests Data type Lite Pro Pro + SPA Harvest frequency Page view metrics/events yes yes yes One call. Once the second script is downloaded, we immediately make the first harvest call, which generates page view metrics and the PageView event. This is a JSONP call to bam.nr-data.net or bam-cell.nr-data.net. PageViewTiming events yes yes yes All agent types collect PageViewTiming events. The first harvest happens 10 seconds after the agent initializes, after window load event. After that, we send additional PageViewTiming events every 30 seconds, but only if there's data to send. For information about the event types included in these harvest calls, see the PageViewTiming section of our data dictionary. JavaScriptError metrics/events no yes yes First call when agent initializes; every 60 seconds after that. These calls, sent as metrics data, happen every 60 seconds because we include the Ajax calls that the agent itself makes. This information also applies to Ajax metrics. Ajax metrics no yes yes Sent together with JavaScript errors. Ajax events no yes yes Sent together with BrowserInteraction events. These are collected immediately when an interaction finishes. We only collect interactions for the initial page load and for route changes. We also have an API for generating custom interactions. There will be a separate call for each interaction. Typically, these calls are infrequent because they depend on the user interacting with the page. This information also applies to BrowserInteraction events. Session traces no yes yes First call when agent initializes; after that, every 10 seconds if there is data to send. Session traces send the most data, but they are heavily sampled. Only about 75 page views per hour get enabled to send session trace data. The agent sends data every 10 seconds if it has enough data to send. PageAction events no yes yes First call is made when agent initializes; after that, every 30 seconds if there is data to send. BrowserInteraction events no no yes Sent immediately when an interaction finishes. There will always be at least one interaction that represents the initial page load. Additional interactions are collected only if the URL changes (representing route change). Harvest frequency details for Ajax events apply here as well.",

      "body": "You can configure the New Relic Ruby agent with settings in a configuration file, environment variables, or programmatically with server-side configuration. This document summarizes the configuration options available for the Ruby agent. If the default value for a configuration option is (Dynamic), this means the Ruby agent calculates the default at runtime. The value for the config setting defaults to the value of another setting as appropriate. Configuration methods and precedence The primary (default) method to configure the Ruby agent is via the configuration file (newrelic.yml) in the config subdirectory. To set configuration values using environment variables: Add the prefix NEW_RELIC_ to the setting's name. Replace any periods . with underscores _. You can also configure a few values in the UI via server-side configuration. The Ruby agent follows this order of precedence for configuration: Environment variables Server-side configuration Configuration file (newrelic.yml) Default configuration settings In other words, environment variables override all other configuration settings and info, server-side configuration overrides the configuration file and default config settings, and so on. View and edit config file options The Ruby agent's newrelic.yml is a standard YAML configuration file. It typically includes a Defaults section at the top, plus sections below for each application environment; for example, Development, Testing, and Production. The Ruby agent determines which section of the newrelic.yml config file to read from by looking at certain environment variables to derive the application's environment. This can be useful, for example, when you want to use info for the log_level config setting in your production environment, and you want more verbose log_level config settings (such as debug in your development environment. Here is an example newrelic.yml config file: common: &default_settings license_key: 'YOUR_LICENSE_KEY' app_name: 'My Application Name' production: <<: *default_settings log_level: info development: <<: *default_settings log_level: debug Copy For non-Rails apps, the Ruby agent looks for the following environment variables, in this order, to determine the application environment: NEW_RELIC_ENV RUBY_ENV RAILS_ENV APP_ENV RACK_ENV If the Ruby agent does not detect values for any of those environment variables, it will default the application environment to development and read from the development section of the newrelic.yml config file. When running the Ruby agent in a Rails app, the agent first looks for the NEW_RELIC_ENV environment variable to determine the application environment and which section of the newrelic.yml to use. If NEW_RELIC_ENV is not present, the agent uses the Rails environment (RAILS_ENV or RAILS.env, depending on the version of Rails) . When you edit the config file, be sure to: Indent only with two spaces. Indent only where relevant, in stanzas such as error_collector. If you do not indent correctly, the agent may throw an Unable to parse configuration file error on startup. To view the most current list of available Ruby agent configuration options, use the rake newrelic:config:docs command. This document describes the most common options. Update the config file This documentation applies to the Ruby agent's latest release. For details on earlier versions, refer to the comments in newrelic.yml itself. To update newrelic.yml file after a new release, use the template in the base directory of the agent gem. When you update to new gem versions, examine or diff config/newrelic.yml and newrelic.yml in the installation directory to take advantage of new configuration options. Important Updating the gem does not automatically update config/newrelic.yml. General These settings are available for agent configuration. Some settings depend on your New Relic subscription level. license_key Type String Default \"\" Environ variable NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY Your New Relic license key. agent_enabled Type Boolean Default (Dynamic) Environ variable NEW_RELIC_AGENT_ENABLED If true, allows the Ruby agent to run. app_name Type String Default (Dynamic) Environ variable NEW_RELIC_APP_NAME Specify the application name used to aggregate data in the New Relic UI. To report data to multiple apps at the same time, specify a list of names separated by a semicolon ;. For example, MyApp or MyStagingApp;Instance1. monitor_mode Type Boolean Default (Dynamic) Environ variable NEW_RELIC_MONITOR_MODE When true, the agent transmits data about your app to the New Relic collector. log_level Type String Default \"info\" Environ variable NEW_RELIC_LOG_LEVEL Sets the level of detail of log messages. Possible log levels, in increasing verbosity, are: error, warn, info or debug. high_security Type Boolean Default false Environ variable NEW_RELIC_HIGH_SECURITY If true, enables high security mode. Ensure you understand the implications of high security mode before enabling this setting. security_policies_token Type String Default \"\" Environ variable NEW_RELIC_SECURITY_POLICIES_TOKEN Applies Language Agent Security Policy settings. proxy_host Type String Default nil Environ variable NEW_RELIC_PROXY_HOST Defines a host for communicating with the New Relic collector via a proxy server. proxy_port Type Integer Default 8080 Environ variable NEW_RELIC_PROXY_PORT Defines a port for communicating with the New Relic collector via a proxy server. proxy_user Type String Default nil Environ variable NEW_RELIC_PROXY_USER Defines a user for communicating with the New Relic collector via a proxy server. proxy_pass Type String Default nil Environ variable NEW_RELIC_PROXY_PASS Defines a password for communicating with the New Relic collector via a proxy server. capture_params Type Boolean Default false Environ variable NEW_RELIC_CAPTURE_PARAMS When true, the agent captures HTTP request parameters and attaches them to transaction traces, traced errors, and TransactionError events. Caution When using the capture_params setting, the Ruby agent will not attempt to filter secret information. Recommendation: To filter secret information from request parameters, use the attributes.include setting instead. For more information, see the Ruby attribute examples. config_path Type String Default (Dynamic) Environ variable NEW_RELIC_CONFIG_PATH Path to newrelic.yml. If undefined, the agent checks the following directories (in order): config/newrelic.yml, newrelic.yml, $HOME/.newrelic/newrelic.yml and $HOME/newrelic.yml. apdex_t Type Float Default 0.5 Environ variable NEW_RELIC_APDEX_T DEPRECATED For agent versions 3.5.0 or higher, set your Apdex T via the New Relic UI. sync_startup Type Boolean Default false Environ variable NEW_RELIC_SYNC_STARTUP When set to true, forces a synchronous connection to the New Relic collector during application startup. For very short-lived processes, this helps ensure the New Relic agent has time to report. send_data_on_exit Type Boolean Default true Environ variable NEW_RELIC_SEND_DATA_ON_EXIT If true, enables the exit handler that sends data to the New Relic collector before shutting down. timeout Type Integer Default 120 Environ variable NEW_RELIC_TIMEOUT Defines the maximum number of seconds the agent should spend attempting to connect to the collector. force_install_exit_handler Type Boolean Default false Environ variable NEW_RELIC_FORCE_INSTALL_EXIT_HANDLER Forces the exit handler that sends all cached data to collector before shutting down to be installed regardless of detecting scenarios where it generally should not be. Known use-case for this option is where Sinatra is running as an embedded service within another framework and the agent is detecting the Sinatra app and skipping the at_exit handler as a result. Sinatra classically runs the entire application in an at_exit block and would otherwise misbehave if the Agent's at_exit handler was also installed in those circumstances. Note: send_data_on_exit should also be set to true in tandem with this setting. log_file_name Type String Default \"newrelic_agent.log\" Environ variable NEW_RELIC_LOG_FILE_NAME Defines a name for the log file. log_file_path Type String Default \"log/\" Environ variable NEW_RELIC_LOG_FILE_PATH Defines a path to the agent log file, excluding the filename. prepend_active_record_instrumentation Type Boolean Default false Environ variable NEW_RELIC_PREPEND_ACTIVE_RECORD_INSTRUMENTATION If true, uses Module#prepend rather than alias_method for ActiveRecord instrumentation. capture_memcache_keys Type Boolean Default false Environ variable NEW_RELIC_CAPTURE_MEMCACHE_KEYS Enable or disable the capture of memcache keys from transaction traces. message_tracer.segment_parameters.enabled Type Boolean Default true Environ variable NEW_RELIC_MESSAGE_TRACER_SEGMENT_PARAMETERS_ENABLED If true, the agent will collect metadata about messages and attach them as segment parameters. marshaller Type String Default \"json\" Environ variable NEW_RELIC_MARSHALLER Specifies a marshaller for transmitting data to the New Relic collector.

      "body": "Browser uses a JavaScript snippet, also referred to as an \"agent,\" to instrument your app's webpages. The JavaScript collects data for browser monitoring. To install the browser agent, you can choose from a number of deployment options. If you don't have one already, create a New Relic account. It's free, forever. Get an account Enable browser monitoring Browser Pro+SPA is the default agent when you enable browser monitoring. This automatically gives you access to all of our browser monitoring features. For more information about the browser monitoring options, see Browser agent types in this document. To enable browser monitoring: Go to one.newrelic.com, select Browser, and then select Add more data. Follow the instructions in the UI to add browser monitoring to your app. Generate some traffic for your app, then wait a few minutes for data to appear in New Relic. Optional: After installation is complete and you are seeing data, go to the App settings page for additional agent configuration, or to change the browser agent type. It may take several minutes after enabling the browser monitoring agent before your webpage data appear in New Relic. If have problems, follow our troubleshooting tips. Deployment options No matter which option you use to deploy browser monitoring, the end result is the same: the browser monitoring JavaScript snippet (also referred to as the \"agent\") is inserted into your app pages. The method you select depends on your preferences and business needs. Enable an APM-monitored app When enabling browser monitoring, you can use an APM agent to automatically inject the browser monitoring JavaScript snippet for you. This is the easiest way to install the agent for an app that's already being monitored by APM. APM-monitored apps are listed on your APM Applications index. Enable with copy/paste When enabling browser monitoring, you can manually insert the JavaScript snippet into your app's webpages. The copy/paste option gives you control over the exact placement of our JavaScript snippet, which is required to monitor the webpage's performance. This is useful for: Standalone apps, static sites, and cached pages delivered by CDN APM apps that are not as closely coupled to the browser app as with a standard server-side app (for example, when your client-side app talks to a REST API back end) Some tips for using the JavaScript snippet: Placement in your webpage: Copy the code snippet, then paste it inline into your pages as close to the top of the <head> element as possible, but after any position-sensitive <meta> tags (for example, X-UA-Compatible or charset information). For more information on the inline head placement, see JavaScript placement requirements. License key and app ID: Near the bottom of the generated JavaScript is your browser license key and application ID. This is useful with the REST API and API Explorer. Instrument webpages using the APM agent This information applies to apps that are also monitored by APM. Our APM agents can instrument webpages with the required JavaScript for page load timing. If you are using an APM agent's API to manually add the JavaScript snippet to your webpages, insert the instrumentation snippet as close to the top as possible. This allows you to take advantage of detailed information about browser's AJAX calls and JavaScript errors. For more information, see the instructions for your APM agent: C SDK Go Java .NET Node.js PHP Python Ruby Use REST API This information applies to apps that are also monitored by APM. The REST API lets you manage deployment outside the browser monitoring UI. This is useful for large organizations deploying multiple apps. Browser agent types: Lite, Pro, Pro+SPA We have three types of browser agents: Lite, Pro, and Pro+SPA. The agent type has no impact on your billing. Browser agent type Comparison Pro+SPA This is the default installed agent when you enable browser monitoring. What it includes: Gives you access to all of the Browser Pro features and to Single Page App (SPA) monitoring. Provides detailed page timing data and the most up-to-date New Relic features, including distributed tracing, for all types of applications. Pro+SPA is not limited only to single page applications. After install, you can downgrade anytime to the less advanced agents if you don't want or need SPA monitoring. Pro What it includes: Gives you access to the Browser Pro features. What it doesn't include: Lacks the functionality designed for single page app monitoring. Lite What it includes: Gives you information about some basic page load timing and browser user information. What it doesn't include: Lacks the Browser Pro features and SPA features. Details about how agent types relate to pricing: New Relic One pricing: This pricing model has data ingest as a billing factor. If you want to reduce data ingest, you may want to consider downgrading to lesser agent types after install. Original pricing: Your access to browser monitoring features is gated by your subscription plan, not by the agent type. This means there is no reason not to use the default Pro+SPA agent. After initial agent installation is finished, you can go to the App settings page to edit your configuration or to change your subscription.",

      "body": "Browser monitoring's JavaScript snippet introduces a nearly invisible impact on website performance and user perception of the time it takes a page to load. The JavaScript is included in a packet of webpage data that is sent anyway. In addition, it immediately begins monitoring for errors and events as the rest of the webpage executes. The negligible amount of overhead required to load the JavaScript results in a significant return of actionable data. Overall impact The JavaScript's overhead takes into consideration both the impact on the user and the impact on your systems' performance: User perception: Typically users cannot detect performance degradations on a website of less than 200ms. Browser's JavaScript adds less than 15ms in aggregated time per page load. This is split up over time, so at no point would a user be able to perceive any performance impact due to the JavaScript. Webserver and systems: Browser app monitoring occurs on the user's browser, not on the server. Processing time does not have an impact on your CPU consumption. In addition, we take additional steps to minimize any potential impact on the apps and webpages being monitored. For example, the \"loader\" script is loaded synchronously in the <HEAD> in order to ensure monitoring is enabled for the entire life cycle of the page. This script is included inline, which eliminates the need for another roundtrip network request to a content delivery network (CDN). The \"loader\" comes with the initial page load. Later in the life cycle of the page, New Relic loads an additional monitoring script asynchronously. This script should not have any perceivable effect to the user and is included in the overall overhead of less than 15ms per page. Network impact Browser monitoring also minimizes network traffic for the end user by aggregating data locally (in the client) and sending it back to New Relic on load, at periodic intervals, on unload, or when data has been collected. (During the browser session's idle periods, transmissions may not be required.) Browser agent scripts The agent consists of two scripts. The first script is inserted inline into the HTML document. The second script is downloaded from the content delivery network (js-agent.newrelic.com) when the window load event happens. Find out about browser agent types here. Script Lite Pro Pro + SPA Inline script size 8.3 KB 22 KB 27 KB Downloaded script size 27 KB 27 KB 38 KB Browser agent harvests Data type Lite Pro Pro + SPA Harvest frequency Page view metrics/events yes yes yes One call. Once the second script is downloaded, we immediately make the first harvest call, which generates page view metrics and the PageView event. This is a JSONP call to bam.nr-data.net or bam-cell.nr-data.net. PageViewTiming events yes yes yes All agent types collect PageViewTiming events. The first harvest happens 10 seconds after the agent initializes, after window load event. After that, we send additional PageViewTiming events every 30 seconds, but only if there's data to send. For information about the event types included in these harvest calls, see the PageViewTiming section of our data dictionary. JavaScriptError metrics/events no yes yes First call when agent initializes; every 60 seconds after that. These calls, sent as metrics data, happen every 60 seconds because we include the Ajax calls that the agent itself makes. This information also applies to Ajax metrics. Ajax metrics no yes yes Sent together with JavaScript errors. Ajax events no yes yes Sent together with BrowserInteraction events. These are collected immediately when an interaction finishes. We only collect interactions for the initial page load and for route changes. We also have an API for generating custom interactions. There will be a separate call for each interaction. Typically, these calls are infrequent because they depend on the user interacting with the page. This information also applies to BrowserInteraction events. Session traces no yes yes First call when agent initializes; after that, every 10 seconds if there is data to send. Session traces send the most data, but they are heavily sampled. Only about 75 page views per hour get enabled to send session trace data. The agent sends data every 10 seconds if it has enough data to send. PageAction events no yes yes First call is made when agent initializes; after that, every 30 seconds if there is data to send. BrowserInteraction events no no yes Sent immediately when an interaction finishes. There will always be at least one interaction that represents the initial page load. Additional interactions are collected only if the URL changes (representing route change). Harvest frequency details for Ajax events apply here as well.",

      "body": "Your end-user experience depends on your entire technology stack. You need to quickly understand what's causing a customer complaint or issue. Did the problem come from your infrastructure, your application, or the browsers that ultimately render it? Is it the result of a problematic internet provider, a problem in your own data center with failing CPU or memory, or something else? Tip This doc gives you detailed information about why our browser monitoring solution matters to your business. But if you want to skip ahead, just sign up for a New Relic account. (It's free, forever!) Then, after you install the browser monitoring agent, you can start working with your data. More than Real User Monitoring (RUM) Many websites contain dynamic content that is loaded after the initial page has finished loading, and complex JavaScript code increases the need for error reporting. Browser monitoring in New Relic One provides a Real User Monitoring (RUM) solution that measures the speed and performance of your end users as they navigate to your site from different web browsers, devices, operating systems, and networks. With browser monitoring in New Relic One, you see actionable data about your end users' experience with your app. But browser monitoring in New Relic goes far beyond the initial page load to measure full page life cycle data. For example, our browser UI shows you: Actual performance data, such as by page view popularity and user satisfaction (Apdex) scores Perceived performance data that measures how quickly your async or dynamic visuals and interactive page contents display JavaScript error analytics, stack traces, and line-of-code visibility, to show you the end-user steps leading up to an error itself Session performance with a detailed timeline and heat map of the load and interaction events during a webpage's full life cycle AJAX requests indicating problems with timing, end points, and specific locations in the webpage Hash-based route changes in apps with single-page application (SPA) architectures These tools (and more!) help your teams optimize your end users' page load experience, eliminate bugs, and troubleshoot faster across your full stack. Examine user perceptions Real user data gives insights into actual page performance, but you also need to look into your users' perception of your site's performance. Pages can load content in many different ways, and users control when they interact with that content. This is why some user-centric performance metrics happen outside the standard window onload (page load time) in the browser monitoring agent. The PageViewTiming event provides a more real-time delivery mechanism that does not have a dependency on any other event. Additional metrics include: First paint, first contentful paint, and largest contentful paint First input delay First interaction This helps you understand how users experience your site, both from visual and responsiveness standpoints. Improve interactive app performance Our single-page app (SPA) monitoring automatically tracks route changes, initial page loads, and synchronous and asynchronous activity during browser interactions. You can also use our browser agent and SPA API to monitor virtually anything that executes inside the browser. If you are a developer, SPA monitoring can help you: Create faster, more responsive, highly interactive apps. Monitor the throughput and performance that real users are experiencing. Troubleshoot and resolve problems within the context of the page load. Query and visualize the data to assist with business decisions. Bring better apps to the marketplace more quickly. Correlate front-end and back-end problems With New Relic One, you can instrument any type of data you need, such as metrics, events, logs, and traces. This helps you find actionable data about your end users' experience across the stack. For example: Type of data Comments Locations or domains Limit browser monitoring to focus on specific geographical locations or specific types of end-user activity. You can also monitor or block specific domains. Trends in interactions Use our comparative charting feature for a direct page load time comparison between real user (browser) interactions and trends appearing in Synthetic monitors. Distributed tracing Isolate latency from the web browser through back-end services with distributed tracing. The UI helps you see the connection across across a full transaction, from browser activity, to time spent in network, to back-end activity. Browser types Explore your end users' experience with your app segmented by any types of browsers they use, including: Top browsers by throughput Average page load time by platform type (mobile, desktop, and other) Selected browser type by version (for example, Chrome 31, 32, 33, etc.) This helps you quickly determine whether problems with page load timing may be related to a specific browser type or platform, or whether the problem is more widespread. Get started with browser monitoring Follow these basic steps, and you'll quickly be up and running in New Relic with browser monitoring! Review the compatibility details and basic requirements for browser monitoring. Install the browser agent. Go to [one.newrelic.com > Explorer > Browser applications. Use the Explorer to access all your entities, that is, anything we can identify that reports data, from applications and hosts to custom groupings of any elements. View summary data from your Browser summary page, then drill down into page load timing details and other UI data. Configure your alerts for key performance data, or use our Applied Intelligence solutions to reduce alert noise, correlate incidents, and automatically detect anomalies. Query and visualize your default data (or customize your own), then analyze what that data says about your business. Customize and share your own charts and dashboards.",

Extend agent instrumentation Other helpful tools include: Tools Description Browser monitoring Integrate the Python agent with browser monitoring to gain visibility into end-user browser activity. Simple scripts and background tasks Monitor job-based or task queuing systems, like Celery, or other standalone non-web functions. Business data analysis with data exploration. Use the Python agent with our data explorer to organize, query, and visualize your data to answer key questions about application performance and customer experience. Use default transaction attributes, or add your own. Query your data using the New Relic Query Language (NRQL). Send your own event data. Create and share customizable, interactive dashboards. Install the Python agent Before you install the Python agent, make sure your system meets the system requirements. You must also create a New Relic account. We support a number of web frameworks and libraries right out of the box, including Django, WSGI, and Gunicorn. If you use one of the supported web frameworks, installation is easy. If you use an unsupported framework, the process will involve some additions to your app code and/or web server files. For a quick and simple install process that will work for the majority of setups, follow these simple steps: Download and install the Python package. Create config file. Integrate the Python agent with your application. Read the Quick Start guide Add Python data Monitor non-web scripts, background tasks, and functions The Python agent also lets you monitor non-web scripts, worker processes, tasks, and functions. The installation process for these non-web transactions is similar to the one used for a web app, with one major difference: instead of going through the standard integration process described in the install instructions, you would manually \"wrap\" any function you want to monitor. For more information, see Non-web tasks and processes. For instructions on monitoring Celery tasks, see Celery background tasks. What's next after installation? Once you get the agent up and running, some suggested next steps are: Explore your data in and get comfortable with the user interface. Read our docs on our other observability solutions and the APM page. Change your application's name, or other configuration options. Learn about setting up custom instrumentation for application activity not monitored by default. Consider the Python Telemetry SDK. Troubleshooting After you complete the install process, your data should appear in the APM UI within five minutes. If it does not, use these troubleshooting resources: If no data appears, follow these troubleshooting steps. If you experience issues when installing or running the Python agent on a new host, test that the package is installed correctly and that it can contact New Relic's data collector service. For other problems, see the full list of troubleshooting documentation. Check the source code The Python agent is open source software. That means you can browse its source code and send improvements, or create your own fork and build it. For more information, see the README.",

We’re very proud of the utility and design of our dashboards, alerts, and versatile programmability, but none of it would be possible without the computing power needed to make it all run smoothly. Just like a finely calibrated race car, what you see on the outside may be the most exciting features, and these are the parts you interact with to “drive.” But without an engine designed to win, elegant instrument panels, a responsive clutch, and a great paint job won’t get you anywhere. Under the hood of New Relic lies the engine powering it all: the New Relic Database (NRDB). In this resource, we explain how NRDB helps you succeed in your observability goals. Billions of data points per minute New Relic ingests billions of telemetry data points every minute, serving more than 180,000 accounts simultaneously. To run such a high-volume platform, the underlying database and query capabilities need to be fast, flexible, and scalable. They must also be equally effective for organizations of all sizes, supporting a wide spectrum of telemetry needs and business goals. NRDB provides the power, speed, and scalability you need to monitor your performance across your entire landscape quickly and effectively. Scale, purpose, and equal access to resources To meet the challenging demands for speed, efficiency, scalability, and reliability, we built NRDB with three key objectives. Unlimited scalability: Hosted in the cloud, NRDB's distributed architecture has the capacity for virtually unlimited scale. Monitoring and analysis: With this dual purpose in mind, NRDB handles operational monitoring and data analytics equally well. This means that NRDB can ingest massive amounts of data while also giving you real-time alerting, lightning-fast queries, and charting — all without sacrificing speed. Resources when you need them: As a multi-tenant system supporting tens of thousands of customers, NRDB gives you the resources you need when you need them (which single-tenant systems cannot match). The lifecycle of a query NRDB returns results for queries of all sizes astonishingly fast. To do this, we use parallel processing at massive scale. This architectural approach is equally effective for accelerating a single large query and for allowing numerous users to run small queries simultaneously without impacting speed. It works like this: A user enters a query using one of our tools, such as the query builder, or a dashboard or other type of instrumentation sends an automated query. NRDB starts by sending the query to a router, which in turn sends the query components to hundreds or even thousands of query workers. The query workers find the data, and the process is repeated in reverse, with data returning to populate dashboards, create alerts, or answer discrete queries, among other things. This process yields complete query results in a fraction of the time that other methods would require. To further improve efficiency, NRDB also caches recent queries, allowing it to send those results back to users nearly instantaneously. The result: flexibility, speed, accuracy, and efficiency How big is the difference? Because of NDRB's raw power and purposeful design, New Relic's telemetry products are able to analyze tens of billions of events per second while maintaining a median query response time of 45 milliseconds. We would say, “Your query results are just a heartbeat away,” but mathematically that’s more like a tenth of a heartbeat (unless you’re a mouse). What do these statistics mean for our customers? At the end of the day, NRDB's speed and unique capabilities enable you to identify, analyze, and fix performance problems much faster, reducing downtime so you can get back to business. What’s next? Now it's time to get data into New Relic! New Relic-built agents and integrations There are many ways to get data into your New Relic account. Any New Relic user can use any of our data ingest methods to report data to our platform.When you enable New Relic solutions like APM, browser monitoring, mobile monitoring, infrastructure monitoring, or any of our wide array of quickstarts, by default you'll receive data from your monitored applications, hosts, services, or other entities.

      "body": "Your end-user experience depends on your entire technology stack. You need to quickly understand what's causing a customer complaint or issue. Did the problem come from your infrastructure, your application, or the browsers that ultimately render it? Is it the result of a problematic internet provider, a problem in your own data center with failing CPU or memory, or something else? Tip This doc gives you detailed information about why our browser monitoring solution matters to your business. But if you want to skip ahead, just sign up for a New Relic account. (It's free, forever!) Then, after you install the browser monitoring agent, you can start working with your data. More than Real User Monitoring (RUM) Many websites contain dynamic content that is loaded after the initial page has finished loading, and complex JavaScript code increases the need for error reporting. Browser monitoring in New Relic One provides a Real User Monitoring (RUM) solution that measures the speed and performance of your end users as they navigate to your site from different web browsers, devices, operating systems, and networks. With browser monitoring in New Relic One, you see actionable data about your end users' experience with your app. But browser monitoring in New Relic goes far beyond the initial page load to measure full page life cycle data. For example, our browser UI shows you: Actual performance data, such as by page view popularity and user satisfaction (Apdex) scores Perceived performance data that measures how quickly your async or dynamic visuals and interactive page contents display JavaScript error analytics, stack traces, and line-of-code visibility, to show you the end-user steps leading up to an error itself Session performance with a detailed timeline and heat map of the load and interaction events during a webpage's full life cycle AJAX requests indicating problems with timing, end points, and specific locations in the webpage Hash-based route changes in apps with single-page application (SPA) architectures These tools (and more!) help your teams optimize your end users' page load experience, eliminate bugs, and troubleshoot faster across your full stack. Examine user perceptions Real user data gives insights into actual page performance, but you also need to look into your users' perception of your site's performance. Pages can load content in many different ways, and users control when they interact with that content. This is why some user-centric performance metrics happen outside the standard window onload (page load time) in the browser monitoring agent. The PageViewTiming event provides a more real-time delivery mechanism that does not have a dependency on any other event. Additional metrics include: First paint, first contentful paint, and largest contentful paint First input delay First interaction This helps you understand how users experience your site, both from visual and responsiveness standpoints. Improve interactive app performance Our single-page app (SPA) monitoring automatically tracks route changes, initial page loads, and synchronous and asynchronous activity during browser interactions. You can also use our browser agent and SPA API to monitor virtually anything that executes inside the browser. If you are a developer, SPA monitoring can help you: Create faster, more responsive, highly interactive apps. Monitor the throughput and performance that real users are experiencing. Troubleshoot and resolve problems within the context of the page load. Query and visualize the data to assist with business decisions. Bring better apps to the marketplace more quickly. Correlate front-end and back-end problems With New Relic One, you can instrument any type of data you need, such as metrics, events, logs, and traces. This helps you find actionable data about your end users' experience across the stack. For example: Type of data Comments Locations or domains Limit browser monitoring to focus on specific geographical locations or specific types of end-user activity. You can also monitor or block specific domains. Trends in interactions Use our comparative charting feature for a direct page load time comparison between real user (browser) interactions and trends appearing in Synthetic monitors. Distributed tracing Isolate latency from the web browser through back-end services with distributed tracing. The UI helps you see the connection across across a full transaction, from browser activity, to time spent in network, to back-end activity. Browser types Explore your end users' experience with your app segmented by any types of browsers they use, including: Top browsers by throughput Average page load time by platform type (mobile, desktop, and other) Selected browser type by version (for example, Chrome 31, 32, 33, etc.) This helps you quickly determine whether problems with page load timing may be related to a specific browser type or platform, or whether the problem is more widespread. Get started with browser monitoring Follow these basic steps, and you'll quickly be up and running in New Relic with browser monitoring! Review the compatibility details and basic requirements for browser monitoring. Install the browser agent. Go to [one.newrelic.com > Explorer > Browser applications. Use the Explorer to access all your entities, that is, anything we can identify that reports data, from applications and hosts to custom groupings of any elements. View summary data from your Browser summary page, then drill down into page load timing details and other UI data. Configure your alerts for key performance data, or use our Applied Intelligence solutions to reduce alert noise, correlate incidents, and automatically detect anomalies. Query and visualize your default data (or customize your own), then analyze what that data says about your business. Customize and share your own charts and dashboards.",

You can also extend your performance monitoring to collect and analyze business data to help you improve the customer experience and make data-driven business decisions. With flexible options for custom instrumentation and APIs, The Python agent offers multiple building blocks to customize the data you need from your app. Our Python works with a wide variety of web frameworks and hosting mechanisms, including Django, Gunicorn, WSGI, CherryPy, uWSGI, and more. You can also install the Python agent in a Google App Engine flexible environment. Monitor app performance After you install the Python agent, it begins to collect data about your app. You can view the data as charts and tables in New Relic One. View the big picture of your app. Monitor your app's Apdex (user satisfaction). Get a high-level summary of your app with Summary page. Enable distributed tracing to see activity across an architecture having many services. Install Infrastructure monitoring and view detailed server/host data for your app. Find errors and problems quickly. Track key transactions specific to your business. Create custom dashboards for important metrics. Alert your team when an error or problem occurs before it affects your users. View performance after a deployment. Drill down into performance details. Examine code-level transaction traces. Examine database query traces. Examine error traces. Use thread profiler sessions to see detailed stack traces of sampled threads View logs for your APM and infrastructure data Bring your logs and application's data together to make troubleshooting easier and faster. No need to switch to another UI page in New Relic One. With logs in context, you can see log messages related to your errors and traces directly in your app's UI. You can also see logs in context of your infrastructure data, such as Kubernetes clusters. Extend agent instrumentation Other helpful tools include: Tools Description Browser monitoring Integrate the Python agent with browser monitoring to gain visibility into end-user browser activity. Simple scripts and background tasks Monitor job-based or task queuing systems, like Celery, or other standalone non-web functions. Business data analysis with data exploration. Use the Python agent with our data explorer to organize, query, and visualize your data to answer key questions about application performance and customer experience. Use default transaction attributes, or add your own. Query your data using the New Relic Query Language (NRQL). Send your own event data. Create and share customizable, interactive dashboards. Install the Python agent Before you install the Python agent, make sure your system meets the system requirements. You must also create a New Relic account. We support a number of web frameworks and libraries right out of the box, including Django, WSGI, and Gunicorn. If you use one of the supported web frameworks, installation is easy. If you use an unsupported framework, the process will involve some additions to your app code and/or web server files. For a quick and simple install process that will work for the majority of setups, follow these simple steps: Download and install the Python package. Create config file. Integrate the Python agent with your application. Read the Quick Start guide Add Python data Monitor non-web scripts, background tasks, and functions The Python agent also lets you monitor non-web scripts, worker processes, tasks, and functions. The installation process for these non-web transactions is similar to the one used for a web app, with one major difference: instead of going through the standard integration process described in the install instructions, you would manually \"wrap\" any function you want to monitor. For more information, see Non-web tasks and processes. For instructions on monitoring Celery tasks, see Celery background tasks. What's next after installation? Once you get the agent up and running, some suggested next steps are: Explore your data in and get comfortable with the user interface. Read our docs on our other observability solutions and the APM page. Change your application's name, or other configuration options. Learn about setting up custom instrumentation for application activity not monitored by default. Consider the Python Telemetry SDK. Troubleshooting After you complete the install process, your data should appear in the APM UI within five minutes. If it does not, use these troubleshooting resources: If no data appears, follow these troubleshooting steps. If you experience issues when installing or running the Python agent on a new host, test that the package is installed correctly and that it can contact New Relic's data collector service. For other problems, see the full list of troubleshooting documentation. Check the source code The Python agent is open source software. That means you can browse its source code and send improvements, or create your own fork and build it. For more information, see the README.",

Browser's JavaScript adds less than 15ms in aggregated time per page load. This is split up over time, so at no point would a user be able to perceive any performance impact due to the JavaScript. Webserver and systems: Browser app monitoring occurs on the user's browser, not on the server. Processing time does not have an impact on your CPU consumption. In addition, we take additional steps to minimize any potential impact on the apps and webpages being monitored. For example, the \"loader\" script is loaded synchronously in the <HEAD> in order to ensure monitoring is enabled for the entire life cycle of the page. This script is included inline, which eliminates the need for another roundtrip network request to a content delivery network (CDN). The \"loader\" comes with the initial page load. Later in the life cycle of the page, New Relic loads an additional monitoring script asynchronously. This script should not have any perceivable effect to the user and is included in the overall overhead of less than 15ms per page. Network impact Browser monitoring also minimizes network traffic for the end user by aggregating data locally (in the client) and sending it back to New Relic on load, at periodic intervals, on unload, or when data has been collected. (During the browser session's idle periods, transmissions may not be required.) Browser agent scripts The agent consists of two scripts. The first script is inserted inline into the HTML document. The second script is downloaded from the content delivery network (js-agent.newrelic.com) when the window load event happens. Find out about browser agent types here. Script Lite Pro Pro + SPA Inline script size 8.3 KB 22 KB 27 KB Downloaded script size 27 KB 27 KB 38 KB Browser agent harvests Data type Lite Pro Pro + SPA Harvest frequency Page view metrics/events yes yes yes One call. Once the second script is downloaded, we immediately make the first harvest call, which generates page view metrics and the PageView event. This is a JSONP call to bam.nr-data.net or bam-cell.nr-data.net. PageViewTiming events yes yes yes All agent types collect PageViewTiming events. The first harvest happens 10 seconds after the agent initializes, after window load event. After that, we send additional PageViewTiming events every 30 seconds, but only if there's data to send. For information about the event types included in these harvest calls, see the PageViewTiming section of our data dictionary. JavaScriptError metrics/events no yes yes First call when agent initializes; every 60 seconds after that. These calls, sent as metrics data, happen every 60 seconds because we include the Ajax calls that the agent itself makes. This information also applies to Ajax metrics. Ajax metrics no yes yes Sent together with JavaScript errors. Ajax events no yes yes Sent together with BrowserInteraction events. These are collected immediately when an interaction finishes. We only collect interactions for the initial page load and for route changes. We also have an API for generating custom interactions. There will be a separate call for each interaction. Typically, these calls are infrequent because they depend on the user interacting with the page. This information also applies to BrowserInteraction events. Session traces no yes yes First call when agent initializes; after that, every 10 seconds if there is data to send. Session traces send the most data, but they are heavily sampled. Only about 75 page views per hour get enabled to send session trace data. The agent sends data every 10 seconds if it has enough data to send. PageAction events no yes yes First call is made when agent initializes; after that, every 30 seconds if there is data to send. BrowserInteraction events no no yes Sent immediately when an interaction finishes. There will always be at least one interaction that represents the initial page load. Additional interactions are collected only if the URL changes (representing route change). Harvest frequency details for Ajax events apply here as well.",

      "body": "Your end-user experience depends on your entire technology stack. You need to quickly understand what's causing a customer complaint or issue. Did the problem come from your infrastructure, your application, or the browsers that ultimately render it? Is it the result of a problematic internet provider, a problem in your own data center with failing CPU or memory, or something else? Tip This doc gives you detailed information about why our browser monitoring solution matters to your business. But if you want to skip ahead, just sign up for a New Relic account. (It's free, forever!) Then, after you install the browser monitoring agent, you can start working with your data. More than Real User Monitoring (RUM) Many websites contain dynamic content that is loaded after the initial page has finished loading, and complex JavaScript code increases the need for error reporting. Browser monitoring in New Relic One provides a Real User Monitoring (RUM) solution that measures the speed and performance of your end users as they navigate to your site from different web browsers, devices, operating systems, and networks. With browser monitoring in New Relic One, you see actionable data about your end users' experience with your app. But browser monitoring in New Relic goes far beyond the initial page load to measure full page life cycle data. For example, our browser UI shows you: Actual performance data, such as by page view popularity and user satisfaction (Apdex) scores Perceived performance data that measures how quickly your async or dynamic visuals and interactive page contents display JavaScript error analytics, stack traces, and line-of-code visibility, to show you the end-user steps leading up to an error itself Session performance with a detailed timeline and heat map of the load and interaction events during a webpage's full life cycle AJAX requests indicating problems with timing, end points, and specific locations in the webpage Hash-based route changes in apps with single-page application (SPA) architectures These tools (and more!) help your teams optimize your end users' page load experience, eliminate bugs, and troubleshoot faster across your full stack. Examine user perceptions Real user data gives insights into actual page performance, but you also need to look into your users' perception of your site's performance. Pages can load content in many different ways, and users control when they interact with that content. This is why some user-centric performance metrics happen outside the standard window onload (page load time) in the browser monitoring agent. The PageViewTiming event provides a more real-time delivery mechanism that does not have a dependency on any other event. Additional metrics include: First paint, first contentful paint, and largest contentful paint First input delay First interaction This helps you understand how users experience your site, both from visual and responsiveness standpoints. Improve interactive app performance Our single-page app (SPA) monitoring automatically tracks route changes, initial page loads, and synchronous and asynchronous activity during browser interactions. You can also use our browser agent and SPA API to monitor virtually anything that executes inside the browser. If you are a developer, SPA monitoring can help you: Create faster, more responsive, highly interactive apps. Monitor the throughput and performance that real users are experiencing. Troubleshoot and resolve problems within the context of the page load. Query and visualize the data to assist with business decisions. Bring better apps to the marketplace more quickly. Correlate front-end and back-end problems With New Relic One, you can instrument any type of data you need, such as metrics, events, logs, and traces. This helps you find actionable data about your end users' experience across the stack. For example: Type of data Comments Locations or domains Limit browser monitoring to focus on specific geographical locations or specific types of end-user activity. You can also monitor or block specific domains. Trends in interactions Use our comparative charting feature for a direct page load time comparison between real user (browser) interactions and trends appearing in Synthetic monitors. Distributed tracing Isolate latency from the web browser through back-end services with distributed tracing. The UI helps you see the connection across across a full transaction, from browser activity, to time spent in network, to back-end activity. Browser types Explore your end users' experience with your app segmented by any types of browsers they use, including: Top browsers by throughput Average page load time by platform type (mobile, desktop, and other) Selected browser type by version (for example, Chrome 31, 32, 33, etc.) This helps you quickly determine whether problems with page load timing may be related to a specific browser type or platform, or whether the problem is more widespread. Get started with browser monitoring Follow these basic steps, and you'll quickly be up and running in New Relic with browser monitoring! Review the compatibility details and basic requirements for browser monitoring. Install the browser agent. Go to [one.newrelic.com > Explorer > Browser applications. Use the Explorer to access all your entities, that is, anything we can identify that reports data, from applications and hosts to custom groupings of any elements. View summary data from your Browser summary page, then drill down into page load timing details and other UI data. Configure your alerts for key performance data, or use our Applied Intelligence solutions to reduce alert noise, correlate incidents, and automatically detect anomalies. Query and visualize your default data (or customize your own), then analyze what that data says about your business. Customize and share your own charts and dashboards.",

To install the browser agent, you can choose from a number of deployment options. If you don't have one already, create a New Relic account. It's free, forever. Get an account Enable browser monitoring Browser Pro+SPA is the default agent when you enable browser monitoring. This automatically gives you access to all of our browser monitoring features. For more information about the browser monitoring options, see Browser agent types in this document. To enable browser monitoring: Go to one.newrelic.com, select Browser, and then select Add more data. Follow the instructions in the UI to add browser monitoring to your app. Generate some traffic for your app, then wait a few minutes for data to appear in New Relic. Optional: After installation is complete and you are seeing data, go to the App settings page for additional agent configuration, or to change the browser agent type. It may take several minutes after enabling the browser monitoring agent before your webpage data appear in New Relic. If have problems, follow our troubleshooting tips. Deployment options No matter which option you use to deploy browser monitoring, the end result is the same: the browser monitoring JavaScript snippet (also referred to as the \"agent\") is inserted into your app pages. The method you select depends on your preferences and business needs. Enable an APM-monitored app When enabling browser monitoring, you can use an APM agent to automatically inject the browser monitoring JavaScript snippet for you. This is the easiest way to install the agent for an app that's already being monitored by APM. APM-monitored apps are listed on your APM Applications index. Enable with copy/paste When enabling browser monitoring, you can manually insert the JavaScript snippet into your app's webpages. The copy/paste option gives you control over the exact placement of our JavaScript snippet, which is required to monitor the webpage's performance. This is useful for: Standalone apps, static sites, and cached pages delivered by CDN APM apps that are not as closely coupled to the browser app as with a standard server-side app (for example, when your client-side app talks to a REST API back end) Some tips for using the JavaScript snippet: Placement in your webpage: Copy the code snippet, then paste it inline into your pages as close to the top of the <head> element as possible, but after any position-sensitive <meta> tags (for example, X-UA-Compatible or charset information). For more information on the inline head placement, see JavaScript placement requirements. License key and app ID: Near the bottom of the generated JavaScript is your browser license key and application ID. This is useful with the REST API and API Explorer. Instrument webpages using the APM agent This information applies to apps that are also monitored by APM. Our APM agents can instrument webpages with the required JavaScript for page load timing. If you are using an APM agent's API to manually add the JavaScript snippet to your webpages, insert the instrumentation snippet as close to the top as possible. This allows you to take advantage of detailed information about browser's AJAX calls and JavaScript errors. For more information, see the instructions for your APM agent: C SDK Go Java .NET Node.js PHP Python Ruby Use REST API This information applies to apps that are also monitored by APM. The REST API lets you manage deployment outside the browser monitoring UI. This is useful for large organizations deploying multiple apps. Browser agent types: Lite, Pro, Pro+SPA We have three types of browser agents: Lite, Pro, and Pro+SPA. The agent type has no impact on your billing. Browser agent type Comparison Pro+SPA This is the default installed agent when you enable browser monitoring. What it includes: Gives you access to all of the Browser Pro features and to Single Page App (SPA) monitoring. Provides detailed page timing data and the most up-to-date New Relic features, including distributed tracing, for all types of applications. Pro+SPA is not limited only to single page applications. After install, you can downgrade anytime to the less advanced agents if you don't want or need SPA monitoring. Pro What it includes: Gives you access to the Browser Pro features. What it doesn't include: Lacks the functionality designed for single page app monitoring. Lite What it includes: Gives you information about some basic page load timing and browser user information. What it doesn't include: Lacks the Browser Pro features and SPA features. Details about how agent types relate to pricing: New Relic One pricing: This pricing model has data ingest as a billing factor. If you want to reduce data ingest, you may want to consider downgrading to lesser agent types after install. Original pricing: Your access to browser monitoring features is gated by your subscription plan, not by the agent type. This means there is no reason not to use the default Pro+SPA agent. After initial agent installation is finished, you can go to the App settings page to edit your configuration or to change your subscription.",

You can also extend your performance monitoring to collect and analyze business data to help you improve the customer experience and make data-driven business decisions. With flexible options for custom instrumentation and APIs, The Python agent offers multiple building blocks to customize the data you need from your app. Our Python works with a wide variety of web frameworks and hosting mechanisms, including Django, Gunicorn, WSGI, CherryPy, uWSGI, and more. You can also install the Python agent in a Google App Engine flexible environment. Monitor app performance After you install the Python agent, it begins to collect data about your app. You can view the data as charts and tables in New Relic One. View the big picture of your app. Monitor your app's Apdex (user satisfaction). Get a high-level summary of your app with Summary page. Enable distributed tracing to see activity across an architecture having many services. Install Infrastructure monitoring and view detailed server/host data for your app. Find errors and problems quickly. Track key transactions specific to your business. Create custom dashboards for important metrics. Alert your team when an error or problem occurs before it affects your users. View performance after a deployment. Drill down into performance details. Examine code-level transaction traces. Examine database query traces. Examine error traces. Use thread profiler sessions to see detailed stack traces of sampled threads View logs for your APM and infrastructure data Bring your logs and application's data together to make troubleshooting easier and faster. No need to switch to another UI page in New Relic One. With logs in context, you can see log messages related to your errors and traces directly in your app's UI. You can also see logs in context of your infrastructure data, such as Kubernetes clusters. Extend agent instrumentation Other helpful tools include: Tools Description Browser monitoring Integrate the Python agent with browser monitoring to gain visibility into end-user browser activity. Simple scripts and background tasks Monitor job-based or task queuing systems, like Celery, or other standalone non-web functions. Business data analysis with data exploration. Use the Python agent with our data explorer to organize, query, and visualize your data to answer key questions about application performance and customer experience. Use default transaction attributes, or add your own. Query your data using the New Relic Query Language (NRQL). Send your own event data. Create and share customizable, interactive dashboards. Install the Python agent Before you install the Python agent, make sure your system meets the system requirements. You must also create a New Relic account. We support a number of web frameworks and libraries right out of the box, including Django, WSGI, and Gunicorn. If you use one of the supported web frameworks, installation is easy. If you use an unsupported framework, the process will involve some additions to your app code and/or web server files. For a quick and simple install process that will work for the majority of setups, follow these simple steps: Download and install the Python package. Create config file. Integrate the Python agent with your application. Read the Quick Start guide Add Python data Monitor non-web scripts, background tasks, and functions The Python agent also lets you monitor non-web scripts, worker processes, tasks, and functions. The installation process for these non-web transactions is similar to the one used for a web app, with one major difference: instead of going through the standard integration process described in the install instructions, you would manually \"wrap\" any function you want to monitor. For more information, see Non-web tasks and processes. For instructions on monitoring Celery tasks, see Celery background tasks. What's next after installation? Once you get the agent up and running, some suggested next steps are: Explore your data in and get comfortable with the user interface. Read our docs on our other observability solutions and the APM page. Change your application's name, or other configuration options. Learn about setting up custom instrumentation for application activity not monitored by default. Consider the Python Telemetry SDK. Troubleshooting After you complete the install process, your data should appear in the APM UI within five minutes. If it does not, use these troubleshooting resources: If no data appears, follow these troubleshooting steps. If you experience issues when installing or running the Python agent on a new host, test that the package is installed correctly and that it can contact New Relic's data collector service. For other problems, see the full list of troubleshooting documentation. Check the source code The Python agent is open source software. That means you can browse its source code and send improvements, or create your own fork and build it. For more information, see the README.",

      "body": "Problem You are not seeing AJAX data for your browser app. Solution If your application is instrumented with browser monitoring and is correctly collecting data for other Pro features, follow these steps: 1. Verify you use XMLHttpRequest. Check whether your application uses the XMLHttpRequest object to make AJAX calls. Browser monitoring: Other methods (including the newer Fetch API) currently are not supported when using browser Pro. Single-page app monitoring: Fetch is supported for AJAX requests within a browser interaction with SPA monitoring. If you are making requests using JSONP, see JSONP requirements. 2. Verify the object is instrumented. If you are using XMLHttpRequest, use your browser's dev console to verify that the object has been instrumented by New Relic. Enter the object name at your console. If instrumentation has succeeded, the console should return something like: function (t){var e=new p(t);try{u.emit(\"new-xhr\"... Copy If instrumentation failed, you will see something like: function XMLHttpRequest() { [native_code] } Copy If you see this type of failure response, see Troubleshooting browser monitoring installation. If you see a different response, you may be using another script or library that is conflicting with New Relic instrumentation. Contact support at support.newrelic.com. 3. Verify network access. If the object is properly instrumented, try triggering an AJAX call in your application while monitoring network traffic in the browser's developer tools. Wait up to one minute, and look for a call to bam.nr-data.net/jserrors with an xhr parameter. If the call fails, check for network issues. If you don't see this call, if it fails with an error not related to network access, or if it succeeds but you still aren't seeing data, get support at support.newrelic.com. If your requests use JSONP, see requirements and notes on functionality below: JSONP requirements If your requests use JSONP, these requests will not appear on the AJAX UI page. However, you can view them as assets within session traces. If using SPA monitoring, you can view them on the Breakdown tab of the Page views page. Requirements for JSONP to be recognized: Each JSONP request must use a unique callback function. Most popular libraries (like jQuery) generate a unique callback function dynamically for each request. The query string callback must be named \"callback\" or \"cb\" in order to be recognized by New Relic. This is the default behavior in most popular libraries.",

      "body": "Browser uses a JavaScript snippet, also referred to as an \"agent,\" to instrument your app's webpages. The JavaScript collects data for browser monitoring. To install the browser agent, you can choose from a number of deployment options. If you don't have one already, create a New Relic account. It's free, forever. Get an account Enable browser monitoring Browser Pro+SPA is the default agent when you enable browser monitoring. This automatically gives you access to all of our browser monitoring features. For more information about the browser monitoring options, see Browser agent types in this document. To enable browser monitoring: Go to one.newrelic.com, select Browser, and then select Add more data. Follow the instructions in the UI to add browser monitoring to your app. Generate some traffic for your app, then wait a few minutes for data to appear in New Relic. Optional: After installation is complete and you are seeing data, go to the App settings page for additional agent configuration, or to change the browser agent type. It may take several minutes after enabling the browser monitoring agent before your webpage data appear in New Relic. If have problems, follow our troubleshooting tips. Deployment options No matter which option you use to deploy browser monitoring, the end result is the same: the browser monitoring JavaScript snippet (also referred to as the \"agent\") is inserted into your app pages. The method you select depends on your preferences and business needs. Enable an APM-monitored app When enabling browser monitoring, you can use an APM agent to automatically inject the browser monitoring JavaScript snippet for you. This is the easiest way to install the agent for an app that's already being monitored by APM. APM-monitored apps are listed on your APM Applications index. Enable with copy/paste When enabling browser monitoring, you can manually insert the JavaScript snippet into your app's webpages. The copy/paste option gives you control over the exact placement of our JavaScript snippet, which is required to monitor the webpage's performance. This is useful for: Standalone apps, static sites, and cached pages delivered by CDN APM apps that are not as closely coupled to the browser app as with a standard server-side app (for example, when your client-side app talks to a REST API back end) Some tips for using the JavaScript snippet: Placement in your webpage: Copy the code snippet, then paste it inline into your pages as close to the top of the <head> element as possible, but after any position-sensitive <meta> tags (for example, X-UA-Compatible or charset information). For more information on the inline head placement, see JavaScript placement requirements. License key and app ID: Near the bottom of the generated JavaScript is your browser license key and application ID. This is useful with the REST API and API Explorer. Instrument webpages using the APM agent This information applies to apps that are also monitored by APM. Our APM agents can instrument webpages with the required JavaScript for page load timing. If you are using an APM agent's API to manually add the JavaScript snippet to your webpages, insert the instrumentation snippet as close to the top as possible. This allows you to take advantage of detailed information about browser's AJAX calls and JavaScript errors. For more information, see the instructions for your APM agent: C SDK Go Java .NET Node.js PHP Python Ruby Use REST API This information applies to apps that are also monitored by APM. The REST API lets you manage deployment outside the browser monitoring UI. This is useful for large organizations deploying multiple apps. Browser agent types: Lite, Pro, Pro+SPA We have three types of browser agents: Lite, Pro, and Pro+SPA. The agent type has no impact on your billing. Browser agent type Comparison Pro+SPA This is the default installed agent when you enable browser monitoring. What it includes: Gives you access to all of the Browser Pro features and to Single Page App (SPA) monitoring. Provides detailed page timing data and the most up-to-date New Relic features, including distributed tracing, for all types of applications. Pro+SPA is not limited only to single page applications. After install, you can downgrade anytime to the less advanced agents if you don't want or need SPA monitoring. Pro What it includes: Gives you access to the Browser Pro features. What it doesn't include: Lacks the functionality designed for single page app monitoring. Lite What it includes: Gives you information about some basic page load timing and browser user information. What it doesn't include: Lacks the Browser Pro features and SPA features. Details about how agent types relate to pricing: New Relic One pricing: This pricing model has data ingest as a billing factor. If you want to reduce data ingest, you may want to consider downgrading to lesser agent types after install. Original pricing: Your access to browser monitoring features is gated by your subscription plan, not by the agent type. This means there is no reason not to use the default Pro+SPA agent. After initial agent installation is finished, you can go to the App settings page to edit your configuration or to change your subscription.",

      "body": "Our Python agent monitors your Python application to help you identify and solve performance issues. You can also extend your performance monitoring to collect and analyze business data to help you improve the customer experience and make data-driven business decisions. With flexible options for custom instrumentation and APIs, The Python agent offers multiple building blocks to customize the data you need from your app. Our Python works with a wide variety of web frameworks and hosting mechanisms, including Django, Gunicorn, WSGI, CherryPy, uWSGI, and more. You can also install the Python agent in a Google App Engine flexible environment. Monitor app performance After you install the Python agent, it begins to collect data about your app. You can view the data as charts and tables in New Relic One. View the big picture of your app. Monitor your app's Apdex (user satisfaction). Get a high-level summary of your app with Summary page. Enable distributed tracing to see activity across an architecture having many services. Install Infrastructure monitoring and view detailed server/host data for your app. Find errors and problems quickly. Track key transactions specific to your business. Create custom dashboards for important metrics. Alert your team when an error or problem occurs before it affects your users. View performance after a deployment. Drill down into performance details. Examine code-level transaction traces. Examine database query traces. Examine error traces. Use thread profiler sessions to see detailed stack traces of sampled threads View logs for your APM and infrastructure data Bring your logs and application's data together to make troubleshooting easier and faster. No need to switch to another UI page in New Relic One. With logs in context, you can see log messages related to your errors and traces directly in your app's UI. You can also see logs in context of your infrastructure data, such as Kubernetes clusters. Extend agent instrumentation Other helpful tools include: Tools Description Browser monitoring Integrate the Python agent with browser monitoring to gain visibility into end-user browser activity. Simple scripts and background tasks Monitor job-based or task queuing systems, like Celery, or other standalone non-web functions. Business data analysis with data exploration. Use the Python agent with our data explorer to organize, query, and visualize your data to answer key questions about application performance and customer experience. Use default transaction attributes, or add your own. Query your data using the New Relic Query Language (NRQL). Send your own event data. Create and share customizable, interactive dashboards. Install the Python agent Before you install the Python agent, make sure your system meets the system requirements. You must also create a New Relic account. We support a number of web frameworks and libraries right out of the box, including Django, WSGI, and Gunicorn. If you use one of the supported web frameworks, installation is easy. If you use an unsupported framework, the process will involve some additions to your app code and/or web server files. For a quick and simple install process that will work for the majority of setups, follow these simple steps: Download and install the Python package. Create config file. Integrate the Python agent with your application. Read the Quick Start guide Add Python data Monitor non-web scripts, background tasks, and functions The Python agent also lets you monitor non-web scripts, worker processes, tasks, and functions. The installation process for these non-web transactions is similar to the one used for a web app, with one major difference: instead of going through the standard integration process described in the install instructions, you would manually \"wrap\" any function you want to monitor. For more information, see Non-web tasks and processes. For instructions on monitoring Celery tasks, see Celery background tasks. What's next after installation? Once you get the agent up and running, some suggested next steps are: Explore your data in and get comfortable with the user interface. Read our docs on our other observability solutions and the APM page. Change your application's name, or other configuration options. Learn about setting up custom instrumentation for application activity not monitored by default. Consider the Python Telemetry SDK. Troubleshooting After you complete the install process, your data should appear in the APM UI within five minutes. If it does not, use these troubleshooting resources: If no data appears, follow these troubleshooting steps. If you experience issues when installing or running the Python agent on a new host, test that the package is installed correctly and that it can contact New Relic's data collector service. For other problems, see the full list of troubleshooting documentation. Check the source code The Python agent is open source software. That means you can browse its source code and send improvements, or create your own fork and build it. For more information, see the README.",

      "body": "Browser monitoring's PageViewTiming event sends each data point as a separate event as soon as it is available. Because we do not restrict the timing, you can receive first paint or first interaction data regardless of when it fires. This document describes why and how to use PageViewTiming and its attributes to query data about your site, component loading, and user performance metrics, both from visual and responsiveness standpoints. Why use PageViewTiming? If your application uses asynchronous or dynamic pages, you may need additional details about site or component loading. But pages can load content in many different ways, and users control when they interact with that content. This is why some user-centric performance metrics happen outside the standard window onload (page load time) in the browser agent. For example, users may become impatient and begin clicking as soon as content is on the webpage. Or, they may wait to use the page until long after content is loaded. The PageViewTiming event provides a more real-time delivery mechanism that does not have a dependency on any other event. The additional metrics can help you understand how users experience your site, both from visual and responsiveness standpoints. Support for Google's Core Web Vitals As of agent version 1177 for browser monitoring, we have full support for Google's Core Web Vitals. It requires a Pro or above Browser agent. Note that the metrics that make up Core Web Vitals evolve over time. The current set focuses on three aspects of the user experience: loading, interactivity, and visual stability. It includes the following metrics and their respective thresholds: Core Web Vitals metrics include loading, interactivity, and visual stability. Largest Contentful Paint (LCP): measures loading performance. To provide a good user experience, LCP should occur within 2.5 seconds of when the page first starts loading. First Input Delay (FID): measures interactivity. To provide a good user experience, pages should have a FID of less than 100 milliseconds. Cumulative Layout Shift (CLS): measures visual stability. To provide a good user experience, pages should maintain a CLS of less than 0.1. For each of these metrics, to ensure you're hitting the recommended target for most of your users, a good threshold to measure is the 75th percentile of page loads, segmented across mobile and desktop devices. To learn more, watch our Nerd Days talk on perceived performance. Detailed visual, interactivity, and responsiveness metrics The BrowserInteraction and PageView events end their reporting when they receive the page window load (or window load and AJAX) timing. However, paint and interactivity metrics can happen at any time. PageViewTiming delivers these metrics as a separate event to: Account for the variability in this timing. Avoid setting an arbitrary timeout. Prevent holding BrowserInteraction and PageView events indefinitely. Additional data Comments firstPaint and firstContentfulPaint The firstPaint and firstContentfulPaint attributes already are available with BrowserInteraction and PageView events. However, they are not always reliably captured before the window onload event fires. Using PageViewTiming gives you a way to capture these metrics even if they happen after the original page load time. This gives you a better understanding of the correlation between responsiveness of that load event and the visual rendering of your content. largestContentfulPaint The largestContentfulPaint,metric is available with agent version 1163 or higher. It reports the render time of the largest content element visible in the viewport. Google's research found that looking at when the largest element was rendered was a more accurate way to measure when the main content of a page is loaded and useful. For more information about this metric, including limitations and considerations, see the w3c draft. We also report the cumulative layout shift (CLS) score attribute with LCP. This attribute is reported as cumulativeLayoutShift. Largest Contentful Paint is one of three metrics identified by Google as the Core Web Vitals. LCP values up to 2.5 secs are considered \"Good,\" between 2.5-4.0 secs are considered \"Needs Improvement,\" and above 4.0 secs are considered \"Poor.\" firstInteraction and firstInputDelay With the addition of firstInteraction and firstInputDelay, you can quickly determine the ways that your users are interacting with that visual content. These metrics tell you not only when they interacted, but what type of interaction (mousedown, pointerdown, etc.) and how long it took for them to receive a response from your site. The firstInputDelay metric lies in the middle of FirstContentfulPaint and Time to Interactive (TTI) metrics. It measures the time between when a first input can be made and when the browser's main thread is able to respond to any interactions. We also report the cumulative layout shift (CLS) score attribute at the moment of the user's first interaction. This attribute is reported as cumulativeLayoutShift. First Input Delay is one of three metrics identified by Google as the Core Web Vitals. FID values up to 100 ms are considered \"Good,\" between 100-300 ms are considered \"Needs Improvement,\" and above 300 ms are considered \"Poor.\" For a more detailed explanation, see our browser monitoring release notes. cumulativeLayoutShift Cumulative Layout Shift (CLS) is available with agent v1177 or higher. CLS is an important, user-centric metric for measuring visual stability because it helps quantify how often users experience unexpected layout shifts. A low CLS helps ensure that the page is delightful. This is one of three metrics identified by Google as the Core Web Vitals. Cumulative Layout Shift is one of three metrics identified by Google as the Core Web Vitals. CLS scores up to 0.1 are considered \"Good,\" between 0.1-0.25 are considered \"Needs Improvement,\" and above 0.25 are considered \"Poor.\" timingName You can review different types of activities with the timingName attribute, such as firstPaint, firstContentfulPaint, firstInteraction, largestContentfulPaint, pageHide and windowUnload. For example, a PageViewTiming event may have a timingName of firstPaint and a firstPaint value of .03. The event will also include all default attributes included with the standard BrowserInteraction and PageView events. elementId This is the Id, if specified, of the largestContentfulPaint element. This value will only be reported with the LCP metric. This value can be null. elementSize This is the reported size of the largestContentfulPaint element. This value will only be reported with the LCP metric. pageHide The pageHide event, available with agent v1177 or higher, is sent when the browser hides the current page in the process of presenting a different page from the session's history. For example, when the user clicks the browser's Back button, the current page receives a pageHide event before the previous page is shown. For supporting documentation and browser compatibility for the pageHide event, see the MDN Web Docs site. We also report the cumulative layout shift (CLS) score attribute with pageHide. This attribute is reported as cumulativeLayoutShift. windowLoad The windowLoad event is available with agent v1177 or higher. This is fired when the whole page has loaded, including all dependent resources such as stylesheets and images. For supporting documentation and browser compatibility for the windowLoad event, see the MDN Web Docs site. We also report the cumulative layout shift (CLS) score attribute with windowLoad. This attribute is reported as cumulativeLayoutShift. windowUnload The windowUnload event is available with agent v1163 or higher. This is fired when a document or child resource is being unloaded. For supporting documentation and browser compatibility for the windowUnload event, see the MDN Web Docs site. We also report the cumulative layout shift (CLS) score attribute with windowUnload. This attribute is reported as cumulativeLayoutShift. Compatibility and requirements Requirements: Meets install requirements. Reporting of this event requires browser agent version 1153 or higher and a Pro or Pro+SPA agent. Follow our Browser agent release notes to find out when new metrics are released. These metrics are supported by the following browser versions. For unsupported browsers, no PageViewTiming events will be recorded.

CumulativeLayoutShift Cumulative Layout Shift (CLS) is a metric measuring the stability of the content on a webpage. For a complete description, see web.dev/cls. How is CLS captured in New Relic Shifts in page layout as reported by the Layout Instability API are aggregated throughout the life of the page and reported as an attribute on all PageViewTiming events, representing the CLS value when that event occurred. Using this model, users can look at their CLS value at different points in the page's life; for example, CLS values up until the first-time users interact with the page or hide the page. Approximating other CLS sources Lighthouse captures CLS value only up to the time when a page is loaded, which is useful in a development or lab environment. You can approximate Lighthouse values by looking at the windowLoad PageViewTiming event. CrUX report uses values captured over the lifespan of the page, which is useful to analyze worst-case shifts in a RUM environment. You can approximate CrUX values by looking at the CLS attribute on the windowUnload PageViewTiming event. These values will not be exactly the same because of different sample sets and a difference in how values from long-lived web pages are included. The New Relic browser monitoring agent captures CLS when the page unloads, while CrUX collects and updates the metric throughout the lifespan of the page. How CLS is aggregated As of July 2021, Google has updated the way CLS values are aggregated. Browser monitoring agent versions v12xx use the method described in Evolving the CLS metric. Browser monitoring agent v12xx or higher: Layout shift values are captured in windows. Layout shifts that occurred within 1 second of each other, but no more than 5 seconds between the first and last shift, are part of the same window. A CLS score represents the sum of layout shift values from the window with the highest sum of layout shift values. Prior to Browser agent v12xx: A CLS score represents the sum of all layout shifts that occurred up until that point in the page's life.

If a user navigates from a site without page load timing to a site with page load timing (for example, to the first page on your page load timing-enabled site), special considerations for navigation start time arise. Contents Network estimate The page load timing JavaScript utility file creates a cookie with the navigation start time when a user leaves a page (by hooking an event, beforeunload, or pagehide, depending on the browser). However, when navigating away from a site without page load timing enabled, the JavaScript code will not be present, and the cookie will not be created. Then, when the user hits the first page of a site, the navigation start time cannot be determined, because there is no cookie. In this case the browser agent has all the data (queue time, app time, DOM content and rendering time) except network time. Navigation start time is required to compute network time. Rather than toss the data, the page load timing feature estimates the network time based on recently accumulated averages for your application, regionally. This way the page load timing feature provides a more accurate throughput measurement, and the rest of the data is retained. This is especially important for sites with a high bounce rate (when users visit only one page). The more visitors you have from different regions, the more accurate the network estimate will be. Network estimate unavailable If a network estimate is not available for your application and for the region where the hit originated, the page load timing process reverts to a network estimate across all reporting apps for the region. Failing that, the data is tossed. Note: For browsers that have the Navigation Timing API, this is not an issue, as the navigation start time can be determined without using a cookie.",

      "body": "This document explains: How a web page loads How browser monitoring measures page load timing, also known as real user monitoring (RUM) Tip This is a description of traditional, synchronous page load timing. Browser can also monitor asynchronous page load timing. Page load process Here are the major steps in the loading of most web pages. The numbers 1-6 in the diagram correspond to the numbered steps below. Page load timeline: The steps involved in a web page load. Browser monitoring charts display the following segments of that process: Network, Web application, DOM processing, and Page rendering. A page load begins when a user selects a hyperlink, submits a form, or types a URL in a browser. This is also referred to as the initial request or the navigation start. The user's action sends a request across the network to the web application server. The request reaches the application for processing. (The request may take some time to start being processed. This could be the result of request queuing or it could be other factors.) The app finishes processing and sends an HTML response back across the network to the user's browser. This is sometimes referred to as response start or first byte. (Time To First Byte) The user's browser begins receiving the HTML response, and starts to process the Document Object Model, or DOM. The DOM finishes loading; this point is known as DOM ready. Using the DOM, the user's browser starts to render the page. The page finishes rendering in the user's browser and the window load event fires. (For pages that use asynchronous loading, some elements may continue to load after the window load event occurs.) Page load time charts in browser monitoring Browser monitoring captures the major page load timing segments in the browser Summary page and the Page views page. If you have SPA monitoring enabled, you will have access to both this chart and SPA-specific charts. The charts show: Network Web application time DOM processing Page rendering Other segments as applicable, such as request queuing The chart colors match the colors in the page load timing diagram. one.newrelic.com > Browser > (select an app) > Summary: The load time chart appears on the Summary and Page views page. The way browser collects these times depends on the browser's capability to use the Navigation Timing Specification API. You can add custom page load timing events with the browser agent API. Here are descriptions of the activity included in the browser load time chart segments: Web application The web application time includes the time spent on the application server. This can only be determined if the browser instrumentation for page load timing was provided by an APM agent. Network The Network layer includes time spent in redirects as well as in requesting and receiving HTML. It does not include time on the server or for static assets. Network time measurement starts from the initial click on a link. Network time includes DNS and may include more than one lookup if you have redirects on your site, TCP (including the firewall, unless you have configured request queue time monitoring), and SSL connect time. If you have configured request queue time monitoring, then the network time does not include any of the request queue time that occurs after the X-Request header. If you have not configured request queue time monitoring, then the network time does include all of the request queue time. The Navigation Timing Specification API provides a detailed breakdown of network time. (For old browsers, the timer starts on the \"before unload event.\") For apps that have been deployed using the copy/paste method, Browser includes web app and queue time in Network time. This is because browser relies on the server-side agent to pass the application values to the browser agent through auto-injection. For more information about how this back-end time breaks down from the browser's point of view, use the Session traces page. The session traces report on all the network related events available, so you can see on a case-by-case basis how the browser is spending time on DNS lookups and other network events. Important Even with request queuing configured, the front-end server's setup can still affect network time. This is because the front-end server does not add the queueing time header until after it actually accepts and processes the request. If the front-end server is configured in some way that causes requests to start backlogging and to queue up in the listener socket that the front-end server uses to accept connections, then you will see network time increase for browser monitoring. The queueing time headers can never account for backlog in this listener socket. DOM processing DOM processing is the time it takes to parse the HTML into a DOM and retrieve or execute synchronous scripts. If the browser starts to download images in this phase, page load timing will capture the image load time. The DOM processing and page rendering layers include network time for static assets (assets that are not explicitly retrieved after page load). However, if a script on the page dynamically inserts image tags and loads images after the server or content delivery system (CDN) finishes, page load timing cannot capture the image load time. Page rendering The Page rendering phase is the time between the DOM being complete and the window load event. This phase measures browser-side processing of the page content, and often includes time for scripts and static assets to load. Request queuing Request queuing will be displayed in the load time chart if your account has both browser and APM linked. In New Relic, request queuing refers to the time between a request entering your production systems and it reaching your application. Depending on the specifics of your production infrastructure, this time may include an actual queue that requests enter, or it may represent other functions that take time (such as load balancing or internal network latency). App server requests vs. browser transactions Often the number of app server transactions (requests per minute or rpm) is larger than the number of browser transactions (pages per minute or ppm) for the same application. For more information, see the troubleshooting procedures. Outliers No matter how well your application performs, there will be some slow browsers, platforms, and networks that make your overall aggregate response times appear slower. To minimize the skew caused by outliers, page load timing clamps and scales the end user response times that are greater than 4.5 times your application's browser Apdex T setting to 4.5 times the Apdex T, or to 13.5 seconds, whichever is greater. (Histogram outliers are cut off at 95%.) For example, if your application's end user Apdex T threshold is 8 seconds, those response times will be clamped at 36 seconds. This minimizes the impact of these response times on your overall application but still provides accounting for \"frustrated\" Apdex scores. For SPA monitoring, outliers are handled differently. When the duration of an initial page load or route change reaches 30 minutes, that event is treated as invalid data and is discarded.",

      "body": "Browser monitoring's PageViewTiming event sends each data point as a separate event as soon as it is available. Because we do not restrict the timing, you can receive first paint or first interaction data regardless of when it fires. This document describes why and how to use PageViewTiming and its attributes to query data about your site, component loading, and user performance metrics, both from visual and responsiveness standpoints. Why use PageViewTiming? If your application uses asynchronous or dynamic pages, you may need additional details about site or component loading. But pages can load content in many different ways, and users control when they interact with that content. This is why some user-centric performance metrics happen outside the standard window onload (page load time) in the browser agent. For example, users may become impatient and begin clicking as soon as content is on the webpage. Or, they may wait to use the page until long after content is loaded. The PageViewTiming event provides a more real-time delivery mechanism that does not have a dependency on any other event. The additional metrics can help you understand how users experience your site, both from visual and responsiveness standpoints. Support for Google's Core Web Vitals As of agent version 1177 for browser monitoring, we have full support for Google's Core Web Vitals. It requires a Pro or above Browser agent. Note that the metrics that make up Core Web Vitals evolve over time. The current set focuses on three aspects of the user experience: loading, interactivity, and visual stability. It includes the following metrics and their respective thresholds: Core Web Vitals metrics include loading, interactivity, and visual stability. Largest Contentful Paint (LCP): measures loading performance. To provide a good user experience, LCP should occur within 2.5 seconds of when the page first starts loading. First Input Delay (FID): measures interactivity. To provide a good user experience, pages should have a FID of less than 100 milliseconds. Cumulative Layout Shift (CLS): measures visual stability. To provide a good user experience, pages should maintain a CLS of less than 0.1. For each of these metrics, to ensure you're hitting the recommended target for most of your users, a good threshold to measure is the 75th percentile of page loads, segmented across mobile and desktop devices. To learn more, watch our Nerd Days talk on perceived performance. Detailed visual, interactivity, and responsiveness metrics The BrowserInteraction and PageView events end their reporting when they receive the page window load (or window load and AJAX) timing. However, paint and interactivity metrics can happen at any time. PageViewTiming delivers these metrics as a separate event to: Account for the variability in this timing. Avoid setting an arbitrary timeout. Prevent holding BrowserInteraction and PageView events indefinitely. Additional data Comments firstPaint and firstContentfulPaint The firstPaint and firstContentfulPaint attributes already are available with BrowserInteraction and PageView events. However, they are not always reliably captured before the window onload event fires. Using PageViewTiming gives you a way to capture these metrics even if they happen after the original page load time. This gives you a better understanding of the correlation between responsiveness of that load event and the visual rendering of your content. largestContentfulPaint The largestContentfulPaint,metric is available with agent version 1163 or higher. It reports the render time of the largest content element visible in the viewport. Google's research found that looking at when the largest element was rendered was a more accurate way to measure when the main content of a page is loaded and useful. For more information about this metric, including limitations and considerations, see the w3c draft. We also report the cumulative layout shift (CLS) score attribute with LCP. This attribute is reported as cumulativeLayoutShift. Largest Contentful Paint is one of three metrics identified by Google as the Core Web Vitals. LCP values up to 2.5 secs are considered \"Good,\" between 2.5-4.0 secs are considered \"Needs Improvement,\" and above 4.0 secs are considered \"Poor.\" firstInteraction and firstInputDelay With the addition of firstInteraction and firstInputDelay, you can quickly determine the ways that your users are interacting with that visual content. These metrics tell you not only when they interacted, but what type of interaction (mousedown, pointerdown, etc.) and how long it took for them to receive a response from your site. The firstInputDelay metric lies in the middle of FirstContentfulPaint and Time to Interactive (TTI) metrics. It measures the time between when a first input can be made and when the browser's main thread is able to respond to any interactions. We also report the cumulative layout shift (CLS) score attribute at the moment of the user's first interaction. This attribute is reported as cumulativeLayoutShift. First Input Delay is one of three metrics identified by Google as the Core Web Vitals. FID values up to 100 ms are considered \"Good,\" between 100-300 ms are considered \"Needs Improvement,\" and above 300 ms are considered \"Poor.\" For a more detailed explanation, see our browser monitoring release notes. cumulativeLayoutShift Cumulative Layout Shift (CLS) is available with agent v1177 or higher. CLS is an important, user-centric metric for measuring visual stability because it helps quantify how often users experience unexpected layout shifts. A low CLS helps ensure that the page is delightful. This is one of three metrics identified by Google as the Core Web Vitals. Cumulative Layout Shift is one of three metrics identified by Google as the Core Web Vitals. CLS scores up to 0.1 are considered \"Good,\" between 0.1-0.25 are considered \"Needs Improvement,\" and above 0.25 are considered \"Poor.\" timingName You can review different types of activities with the timingName attribute, such as firstPaint, firstContentfulPaint, firstInteraction, largestContentfulPaint, pageHide and windowUnload. For example, a PageViewTiming event may have a timingName of firstPaint and a firstPaint value of .03. The event will also include all default attributes included with the standard BrowserInteraction and PageView events. elementId This is the Id, if specified, of the largestContentfulPaint element. This value will only be reported with the LCP metric. This value can be null. elementSize This is the reported size of the largestContentfulPaint element. This value will only be reported with the LCP metric. pageHide The pageHide event, available with agent v1177 or higher, is sent when the browser hides the current page in the process of presenting a different page from the session's history. For example, when the user clicks the browser's Back button, the current page receives a pageHide event before the previous page is shown. For supporting documentation and browser compatibility for the pageHide event, see the MDN Web Docs site. We also report the cumulative layout shift (CLS) score attribute with pageHide. This attribute is reported as cumulativeLayoutShift. windowLoad The windowLoad event is available with agent v1177 or higher. This is fired when the whole page has loaded, including all dependent resources such as stylesheets and images. For supporting documentation and browser compatibility for the windowLoad event, see the MDN Web Docs site. We also report the cumulative layout shift (CLS) score attribute with windowLoad. This attribute is reported as cumulativeLayoutShift. windowUnload The windowUnload event is available with agent v1163 or higher. This is fired when a document or child resource is being unloaded. For supporting documentation and browser compatibility for the windowUnload event, see the MDN Web Docs site. We also report the cumulative layout shift (CLS) score attribute with windowUnload. This attribute is reported as cumulativeLayoutShift. Compatibility and requirements Requirements: Meets install requirements. Reporting of this event requires browser agent version 1153 or higher and a Pro or Pro+SPA agent. Follow our Browser agent release notes to find out when new metrics are released. These metrics are supported by the following browser versions. For unsupported browsers, no PageViewTiming events will be recorded.

CumulativeLayoutShift Cumulative Layout Shift (CLS) is a metric measuring the stability of the content on a webpage. For a complete description, see web.dev/cls. How is CLS captured in New Relic Shifts in page layout as reported by the Layout Instability API are aggregated throughout the life of the page and reported as an attribute on all PageViewTiming events, representing the CLS value when that event occurred. Using this model, users can look at their CLS value at different points in the page's life; for example, CLS values up until the first-time users interact with the page or hide the page. Approximating other CLS sources Lighthouse captures CLS value only up to the time when a page is loaded, which is useful in a development or lab environment. You can approximate Lighthouse values by looking at the windowLoad PageViewTiming event. CrUX report uses values captured over the lifespan of the page, which is useful to analyze worst-case shifts in a RUM environment. You can approximate CrUX values by looking at the CLS attribute on the windowUnload PageViewTiming event. These values will not be exactly the same because of different sample sets and a difference in how values from long-lived web pages are included. The New Relic browser monitoring agent captures CLS when the page unloads, while CrUX collects and updates the metric throughout the lifespan of the page. How CLS is aggregated As of July 2021, Google has updated the way CLS values are aggregated. Browser monitoring agent versions v12xx use the method described in Evolving the CLS metric. Browser monitoring agent v12xx or higher: Layout shift values are captured in windows. Layout shifts that occurred within 1 second of each other, but no more than 5 seconds between the first and last shift, are part of the same window. A CLS score represents the sum of layout shift values from the window with the highest sum of layout shift values. Prior to Browser agent v12xx: A CLS score represents the sum of all layout shifts that occurred up until that point in the page's life.

If a user navigates from a site without page load timing to a site with page load timing (for example, to the first page on your page load timing-enabled site), special considerations for navigation start time arise. Contents Network estimate The page load timing JavaScript utility file creates a cookie with the navigation start time when a user leaves a page (by hooking an event, beforeunload, or pagehide, depending on the browser). However, when navigating away from a site without page load timing enabled, the JavaScript code will not be present, and the cookie will not be created. Then, when the user hits the first page of a site, the navigation start time cannot be determined, because there is no cookie. In this case the browser agent has all the data (queue time, app time, DOM content and rendering time) except network time. Navigation start time is required to compute network time. Rather than toss the data, the page load timing feature estimates the network time based on recently accumulated averages for your application, regionally. This way the page load timing feature provides a more accurate throughput measurement, and the rest of the data is retained. This is especially important for sites with a high bounce rate (when users visit only one page). The more visitors you have from different regions, the more accurate the network estimate will be. Network estimate unavailable If a network estimate is not available for your application and for the region where the hit originated, the page load timing process reverts to a network estimate across all reporting apps for the region. Failing that, the data is tossed. Note: For browsers that have the Navigation Timing API, this is not an issue, as the navigation start time can be determined without using a cookie.",

      "body": "Browser monitoring's PageViewTiming event sends each data point as a separate event as soon as it is available. Because we do not restrict the timing, you can receive first paint or first interaction data regardless of when it fires. This document describes why and how to use PageViewTiming and its attributes to query data about your site, component loading, and user performance metrics, both from visual and responsiveness standpoints. Why use PageViewTiming? If your application uses asynchronous or dynamic pages, you may need additional details about site or component loading. But pages can load content in many different ways, and users control when they interact with that content. This is why some user-centric performance metrics happen outside the standard window onload (page load time) in the browser agent. For example, users may become impatient and begin clicking as soon as content is on the webpage. Or, they may wait to use the page until long after content is loaded. The PageViewTiming event provides a more real-time delivery mechanism that does not have a dependency on any other event. The additional metrics can help you understand how users experience your site, both from visual and responsiveness standpoints. Support for Google's Core Web Vitals As of agent version 1177 for browser monitoring, we have full support for Google's Core Web Vitals. It requires a Pro or above Browser agent. Note that the metrics that make up Core Web Vitals evolve over time. The current set focuses on three aspects of the user experience: loading, interactivity, and visual stability. It includes the following metrics and their respective thresholds: Core Web Vitals metrics include loading, interactivity, and visual stability. Largest Contentful Paint (LCP): measures loading performance. To provide a good user experience, LCP should occur within 2.5 seconds of when the page first starts loading. First Input Delay (FID): measures interactivity. To provide a good user experience, pages should have a FID of less than 100 milliseconds. Cumulative Layout Shift (CLS): measures visual stability. To provide a good user experience, pages should maintain a CLS of less than 0.1. For each of these metrics, to ensure you're hitting the recommended target for most of your users, a good threshold to measure is the 75th percentile of page loads, segmented across mobile and desktop devices. To learn more, watch our Nerd Days talk on perceived performance. Detailed visual, interactivity, and responsiveness metrics The BrowserInteraction and PageView events end their reporting when they receive the page window load (or window load and AJAX) timing. However, paint and interactivity metrics can happen at any time. PageViewTiming delivers these metrics as a separate event to: Account for the variability in this timing. Avoid setting an arbitrary timeout. Prevent holding BrowserInteraction and PageView events indefinitely. Additional data Comments firstPaint and firstContentfulPaint The firstPaint and firstContentfulPaint attributes already are available with BrowserInteraction and PageView events. However, they are not always reliably captured before the window onload event fires. Using PageViewTiming gives you a way to capture these metrics even if they happen after the original page load time. This gives you a better understanding of the correlation between responsiveness of that load event and the visual rendering of your content. largestContentfulPaint The largestContentfulPaint,metric is available with agent version 1163 or higher. It reports the render time of the largest content element visible in the viewport. Google's research found that looking at when the largest element was rendered was a more accurate way to measure when the main content of a page is loaded and useful. For more information about this metric, including limitations and considerations, see the w3c draft. We also report the cumulative layout shift (CLS) score attribute with LCP. This attribute is reported as cumulativeLayoutShift. Largest Contentful Paint is one of three metrics identified by Google as the Core Web Vitals. LCP values up to 2.5 secs are considered \"Good,\" between 2.5-4.0 secs are considered \"Needs Improvement,\" and above 4.0 secs are considered \"Poor.\" firstInteraction and firstInputDelay With the addition of firstInteraction and firstInputDelay, you can quickly determine the ways that your users are interacting with that visual content. These metrics tell you not only when they interacted, but what type of interaction (mousedown, pointerdown, etc.) and how long it took for them to receive a response from your site. The firstInputDelay metric lies in the middle of FirstContentfulPaint and Time to Interactive (TTI) metrics. It measures the time between when a first input can be made and when the browser's main thread is able to respond to any interactions. We also report the cumulative layout shift (CLS) score attribute at the moment of the user's first interaction. This attribute is reported as cumulativeLayoutShift. First Input Delay is one of three metrics identified by Google as the Core Web Vitals. FID values up to 100 ms are considered \"Good,\" between 100-300 ms are considered \"Needs Improvement,\" and above 300 ms are considered \"Poor.\" For a more detailed explanation, see our browser monitoring release notes. cumulativeLayoutShift Cumulative Layout Shift (CLS) is available with agent v1177 or higher. CLS is an important, user-centric metric for measuring visual stability because it helps quantify how often users experience unexpected layout shifts. A low CLS helps ensure that the page is delightful. This is one of three metrics identified by Google as the Core Web Vitals. Cumulative Layout Shift is one of three metrics identified by Google as the Core Web Vitals. CLS scores up to 0.1 are considered \"Good,\" between 0.1-0.25 are considered \"Needs Improvement,\" and above 0.25 are considered \"Poor.\" timingName You can review different types of activities with the timingName attribute, such as firstPaint, firstContentfulPaint, firstInteraction, largestContentfulPaint, pageHide and windowUnload. For example, a PageViewTiming event may have a timingName of firstPaint and a firstPaint value of .03. The event will also include all default attributes included with the standard BrowserInteraction and PageView events. elementId This is the Id, if specified, of the largestContentfulPaint element. This value will only be reported with the LCP metric. This value can be null. elementSize This is the reported size of the largestContentfulPaint element. This value will only be reported with the LCP metric. pageHide The pageHide event, available with agent v1177 or higher, is sent when the browser hides the current page in the process of presenting a different page from the session's history. For example, when the user clicks the browser's Back button, the current page receives a pageHide event before the previous page is shown. For supporting documentation and browser compatibility for the pageHide event, see the MDN Web Docs site. We also report the cumulative layout shift (CLS) score attribute with pageHide. This attribute is reported as cumulativeLayoutShift. windowLoad The windowLoad event is available with agent v1177 or higher. This is fired when the whole page has loaded, including all dependent resources such as stylesheets and images. For supporting documentation and browser compatibility for the windowLoad event, see the MDN Web Docs site. We also report the cumulative layout shift (CLS) score attribute with windowLoad. This attribute is reported as cumulativeLayoutShift. windowUnload The windowUnload event is available with agent v1163 or higher. This is fired when a document or child resource is being unloaded. For supporting documentation and browser compatibility for the windowUnload event, see the MDN Web Docs site. We also report the cumulative layout shift (CLS) score attribute with windowUnload. This attribute is reported as cumulativeLayoutShift. Compatibility and requirements Requirements: Meets install requirements. Reporting of this event requires browser agent version 1153 or higher and a Pro or Pro+SPA agent. Follow our Browser agent release notes to find out when new metrics are released. These metrics are supported by the following browser versions. For unsupported browsers, no PageViewTiming events will be recorded. Metrics Supported browser versions cumulativeLayoutShift Chrome 79 Metric is elevated to stable; changes in metric definition will be reported in this log. Chrome 77 Metric exposed via API: Cumulative Layout Shift available via Layout Instability API firstPaint firstContentfulPaint Chrome 60 or higher for desktop and mobile (Android webview and Chrome for Android) Opera 47 or higher for desktop Opera 44 or higher for Android mobile Samsung Internet for mobile largestContentfulPaint Chrome 77 or higher for desktop and mobile firstInteraction firstInputDelay These metrics require the addEventListener browser API. This API is available in all modern browsers, including: Apple Safari Google Chrome Microsoft Internet Explorer (IE) versions 9 or higher Mozilla Firefox pageHide This metric is currently supported by all browsers on desktop and mobile.

      "body": "This document explains: How a web page loads How browser monitoring measures page load timing, also known as real user monitoring (RUM) Tip This is a description of traditional, synchronous page load timing. Browser can also monitor asynchronous page load timing. Page load process Here are the major steps in the loading of most web pages. The numbers 1-6 in the diagram correspond to the numbered steps below. Page load timeline: The steps involved in a web page load. Browser monitoring charts display the following segments of that process: Network, Web application, DOM processing, and Page rendering. A page load begins when a user selects a hyperlink, submits a form, or types a URL in a browser. This is also referred to as the initial request or the navigation start. The user's action sends a request across the network to the web application server. The request reaches the application for processing. (The request may take some time to start being processed. This could be the result of request queuing or it could be other factors.) The app finishes processing and sends an HTML response back across the network to the user's browser. This is sometimes referred to as response start or first byte. (Time To First Byte) The user's browser begins receiving the HTML response, and starts to process the Document Object Model, or DOM. The DOM finishes loading; this point is known as DOM ready. Using the DOM, the user's browser starts to render the page. The page finishes rendering in the user's browser and the window load event fires. (For pages that use asynchronous loading, some elements may continue to load after the window load event occurs.) Page load time charts in browser monitoring Browser monitoring captures the major page load timing segments in the browser Summary page and the Page views page. If you have SPA monitoring enabled, you will have access to both this chart and SPA-specific charts. The charts show: Network Web application time DOM processing Page rendering Other segments as applicable, such as request queuing The chart colors match the colors in the page load timing diagram. one.newrelic.com > Browser > (select an app) > Summary: The load time chart appears on the Summary and Page views page. The way browser collects these times depends on the browser's capability to use the Navigation Timing Specification API. You can add custom page load timing events with the browser agent API. Here are descriptions of the activity included in the browser load time chart segments: Web application The web application time includes the time spent on the application server. This can only be determined if the browser instrumentation for page load timing was provided by an APM agent. Network The Network layer includes time spent in redirects as well as in requesting and receiving HTML. It does not include time on the server or for static assets. Network time measurement starts from the initial click on a link. Network time includes DNS and may include more than one lookup if you have redirects on your site, TCP (including the firewall, unless you have configured request queue time monitoring), and SSL connect time. If you have configured request queue time monitoring, then the network time does not include any of the request queue time that occurs after the X-Request header. If you have not configured request queue time monitoring, then the network time does include all of the request queue time. The Navigation Timing Specification API provides a detailed breakdown of network time. (For old browsers, the timer starts on the \"before unload event.\") For apps that have been deployed using the copy/paste method, Browser includes web app and queue time in Network time. This is because browser relies on the server-side agent to pass the application values to the browser agent through auto-injection. For more information about how this back-end time breaks down from the browser's point of view, use the Session traces page. The session traces report on all the network related events available, so you can see on a case-by-case basis how the browser is spending time on DNS lookups and other network events. Important Even with request queuing configured, the front-end server's setup can still affect network time. This is because the front-end server does not add the queueing time header until after it actually accepts and processes the request. If the front-end server is configured in some way that causes requests to start backlogging and to queue up in the listener socket that the front-end server uses to accept connections, then you will see network time increase for browser monitoring. The queueing time headers can never account for backlog in this listener socket. DOM processing DOM processing is the time it takes to parse the HTML into a DOM and retrieve or execute synchronous scripts. If the browser starts to download images in this phase, page load timing will capture the image load time. The DOM processing and page rendering layers include network time for static assets (assets that are not explicitly retrieved after page load). However, if a script on the page dynamically inserts image tags and loads images after the server or content delivery system (CDN) finishes, page load timing cannot capture the image load time. Page rendering The Page rendering phase is the time between the DOM being complete and the window load event. This phase measures browser-side processing of the page content, and often includes time for scripts and static assets to load. Request queuing Request queuing will be displayed in the load time chart if your account has both browser and APM linked. In New Relic, request queuing refers to the time between a request entering your production systems and it reaching your application. Depending on the specifics of your production infrastructure, this time may include an actual queue that requests enter, or it may represent other functions that take time (such as load balancing or internal network latency). App server requests vs. browser transactions Often the number of app server transactions (requests per minute or rpm) is larger than the number of browser transactions (pages per minute or ppm) for the same application. For more information, see the troubleshooting procedures. Outliers No matter how well your application performs, there will be some slow browsers, platforms, and networks that make your overall aggregate response times appear slower. To minimize the skew caused by outliers, page load timing clamps and scales the end user response times that are greater than 4.5 times your application's browser Apdex T setting to 4.5 times the Apdex T, or to 13.5 seconds, whichever is greater. (Histogram outliers are cut off at 95%.) For example, if your application's end user Apdex T threshold is 8 seconds, those response times will be clamped at 36 seconds. This minimizes the impact of these response times on your overall application but still provides accounting for \"frustrated\" Apdex scores. For SPA monitoring, outliers are handled differently. When the duration of an initial page load or route change reaches 30 minutes, that event is treated as invalid data and is discarded.",
