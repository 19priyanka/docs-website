      "body": "The APM agent that you installed receives data from your applications. The default data retention is based on your pricing edition. New Relic's default security settings automatically work to ensure data privacy and to limit the kind of information New Relic receives. You can also change these settings. Disclosure and audit Our APM agent is a publicly accessible plugin for web applications. The agent does not do any dynamic code generation while communicating with your app, so using the agent will not introduce any code into your application without your knowledge. Most of our agents are open source, so you can see what our code does: C SDK Go .NET Node.js Python Ruby Data collection Using a JSON message format, data the agent receives from your app is posted once a minute to the New Relic user interface. The website returns a JSON response to the agent, indicating if the data was correctly received or if there was an error. New Relic collects the following aggregate metric data: Database activity External web service calls Controller and dispatch activity View activity Uncaught exceptions and counts Process memory and CPU usage This aggregate metric data summarizes calls to specific methods in your application: how many times each one was called and various response time statistics (average, minimum, maximum, and standard deviation). In New Relic, you will see the class and method names along with their aggregate numbers. New Relic optionally collects: Data collection Comments Uncaught errors New Relic captures the error as well as a runtime stack trace of the offending code. Transaction traces These are snapshots of a single transaction. As an option, the agent can also collect the query statements called within the transaction. The default collection uses obfuscation to hide any strings or numbers from the query. For transactions slower than a threshold you set, New Relic also collects data from SQL EXPLAIN. For database calls slower than a configured threshold, New Relic optionally collects runtime stack traces, which are helpful to pinpoint where in the code a database call is made. Custom parameters You can add custom parameters to your application code and record them with transaction traces to provide additional context while you are examining profiling information. Optional: For both errors and transaction traces, the HTTP request parameters can also be recorded. Security settings If you want to restrict the information that New Relic receives, you can enable high security mode. If high security mode or the default settings do not work for your business needs, you can apply custom settings. Default security settings Depending on the agent, the default settings provide security for request parameters, HTTPS usage, and SQL: C SDK default security settings Go default security settings Java default security settings .NET default security settings Node.js default security settings PHP default security settings Python default security settings Ruby default security settings High security mode When the agent is in high security mode, default settings are locked so that users cannot change them. In addition, high security mode applies restrictions to custom events, custom instrumentation, user attributes, exception messages, or message queue parameters, depending on the agent: C SDK: n/a Go high security mode settings Java high security mode settings .NET high security mode settings Node.js high security mode settings PHP high security mode settings Python high security mode settings Ruby high security mode settings Custom security settings If you want custom security settings, you can customize the configuration file, change custom attribute settings, or use the API, depending on your agent: C SDK custom security settings Go custom security settings Java custom security settings .NET custom security mode settings Node.js custom security settings PHP custom security settings Python custom security settings Ruby custom security settings Data received by New Relic This information applies to all APM agents no matter what security settings you have applied. Important Other data that New Relic receives is specific to the security settings for each agent. Data Captured? APM agent language version OS type and version System properties Average response time of transactions in your app URL hits Client IP address Not captured TLS and SSL Our preferred protocol for all domains is TLS 1.2. APM agents enable SSL by default. To verify which release includes SSL by default and to ensure that you have the most up-to-date version, refer to your agent's release notes: C SDK Go Java .NET Node.js PHP Python Ruby The configuration file also includes an optional flag (ssl) to enable or disable SSL using HTTPS. New Relic does not do host authentication with HTTPS, just communication encryption. Exception: You cannot disable SSL for the C SDK. The C SDK daemon can only connect with SSL. New Relic requires HTTPS for all traffic to APM and the REST API. This includes both inbound and outbound traffic. If your REST API call uses HTTP, or if you have disabled SSL in your configuration file, change your script or program to HTTPS. Data transmission Under Java, .NET and PHP, New Relic uses JSON to serialize data. The Ruby agent uses either Ruby marshaling or JSON serialization to send data to New Relic, depending on whether a native JSON encoder is available in under the Ruby version the agent is running on. For required changes when you want to create firewall rules to allow the agent to communicate, see Networks. For more information about security measures for your data in transit to New Relic or at rest in our storage, see Data encryption. Proxies Optional settings are available so that you can configure the agent to communicate through a proxy. To define proxy settings for host, port, domain, user, or password, refer to your agent's configuration file documentation: Agent Proxy settings C SDK -proxy at daemon startup Go transport Java Use proxy settings, including: proxy_host proxy_password proxy_port proxy_user .NET proxy element Node.js proxy PHP newrelic.daemon.proxy or the daemon's proxy setting Python proxy settings Ruby Use proxy settings, including: proxy_host proxy_port proxy_user proxy_pass",

      "body": "Application performance monitoring (APM) provides monitoring of your web or non-web application's performance. APM supports apps using several programming languages. Our APM agents give you real-time observability matched with trending data about your application's performance and the user experience. Agents reveal what is happening deep in your code with end to end transaction tracing and a variety of color-coded charts and reports. Tip To use APM and the rest of our observability platform, join the New Relic family! Sign up to create your free account in only a few seconds. Then ingest up to 100GB of data for free each month. Forever. Identify problems before your users do Our APM agents report and store the state of your application so you can quickly identify potential problems before they affect your end users. With APM, your DevOps teams don't need to guess whether a performance blocker comes from the app itself, CPU availability, database loads, or something entirely unexpected. Use our APM solutions to gather both current and historical information about memory usage, CPU utilization, database query performance, web browser rendering performance, app availability, error analysis, external services, and other useful metrics. We have agents for Go, Java, .NET, Node.js, PHP, Python, and Ruby, as well as a C SDK. Monitor all aspects of your business Tip To get a high-level overview of all your applications and services, use our New Relic Explorer. Take advantage of these APM features, and more: Features Description App performance at a glance When you sign in to APM and select an app for your account, use the Summary page to quickly examine relationships across different aspects of your environment; for example: Web transactions response time: Where is the most time being spent? In the request queue, during different stages of page rendering and execution, from external services, or something else? Transaction traces: Which transactions are the slowest, and why? Error rate and throughput: What relationship is there between a spike in errors or slower throughput for a particular time period? Was there a deployment or outage at that time? Hosts: What kind of impact does this have on CPU usage, memory, etc.? Apdex: How are these events affecting customers' satisfaction with the site? Web and non-web transactions Start by comparing the top twenty web transactions or non-web transactions in terms of most time consuming, slowest average response time, highest throughput, or worst Apdex. From there, drill down into deeper trace levels for individual transactions, which in turn break down into smaller segments and components, from HTTPS requests on down to SQL queries. Want to explore even deeper? Set up distributed tracing to see how requests move across a distributed system. Select the transactions that are most important to your business (key transactions). APM and Infrastructure When your APM and Infrastructure accounts are linked, you will have access to APM data charts on these Infrastructure UI pages: Hosts, Network, Storage, and Processes. Distributed tracing Distributed tracing gives you visibility across distributed systems, showing you the path of a request as it travels between services. This feature is especially valuable for large, distributed systems that rely on many small services and microservices. Logs Bring your logs and APM agent data together to see logs associated with various objects in the New Relic UI such as applications, APM errors, APM traces, and Kubernetes containers. Service maps APM's service maps show your app's connections and dependencies, including databases and external services. Health indicators and performance metrics show you the current operational status for every part of your architecture. You can create and customize service maps to visualize and monitor your complex architectures. Query your data You can query and visualize your data: Sample and search APM transaction and error data to gain full understanding of the data being collected. Browse your data visually with the data explorer. Create custom SQL-like queries of your data using the New Relic Query Language (NRQL), or using our PromQL-style queries. Use dashboards to build advanced data visualizations, contextualize data, and understand what's going on in your system, real-time. These are just a few of APM's features. To find out more, see the table of contents for APM. Ready to get started? Start benefiting from APM in 5 simple steps (and just a few minutes!). Sign up for a New Relic account. Install and customize the language agent for your app. Generate some traffic for your app. Wait a few minutes for New Relic to start receiving your data.

      "body": "Applications are automatically removed from New Relic after 93 days without sending data to our platform. You can also remove an application using the UI, once it has stopped sending data. Key metrics will continue to be available via the New Relic REST API, with the application name remaining reserved. For more information, see Inactive apps in New Relic One and our data retention guidelines. Before attempting to remove an app Before attempting to remove an APM, browser, or mobile app from the New Relic UI, keep in mind: You can downgrade your account to pay less or make it entirely free. To remove an app, you must have a user role with that capability. If an agent is still sending data from an app, you cannot remove an app. Remove an application from New Relic Before removing an APM, browser, or mobile application from New Relic, stop the application from sending data either by disabling the agent or by uninstalling it completely. APM applications Disable the APM agent: C SDK: Do a quick recompile and deploy. For example, surround your instrumentation in #ifdef, and set the value of YOURNAMESPACE_NEWRELIC_ENABLED with your build system. Go: Set Enabled to false. Java: Set agent_enabled to false. .NET: Set Newrelic.AgentEnabled to false. Node.js: Set agent_enabled to false. PHP: Remove or disable both the newrelic.so and newrelic-daemon components. Set newrelic.enabled to false. Python: Set monitor_mode to false. Ruby: Set agent_enabled to false. Restart the application server and wait up to ten minutes. Verify the color-coded health status for the app has turned to gray and is no longer reporting data. To remove the APM application and any browser applications linked to it, you have two options: Click the Delete application button on the APM application/service's Settings page. Go to one.newrelic.com > APM > (select an app/service) > Settings > Application. Or, call the /applications/delete endpoint of the New Relic REST API. For example: curl -X DELETE 'https://api.newrelic.com/v2/applications/YOUR_APP_ID.json' \\ -H 'X-Api-Key:YOUR_API_KEY' -i Copy Browser If you've used the copy/paste method to install the browser agent, remove the JavaScript snippet from your application's pages. After 93 days, the application will be removed from New Relic. Tip If browser data continues to be reported, see our suggestions below. Once your browser application has stopped reporting, you have two ways to remove it: If your browser application is linked to an APM application, deleting the APM application also removes the browser application. See the instructions for deleting an APM application/service above for details. Or, click the Delete application button on the browser application's Application settings page. Go to one.newrelic.com > Browser > (select an app) > Settings > Application settings . Mobile Remove all references/dependencies to the New Relic's mobile SDK/frameworks, then rebuild the application. For more information, see the iOS and Android install docs. After 93 days, the application will be removed from New Relic. Or, once your mobile application has stopped reporting, you can also remove it manually: Click the Delete application button on the mobile application's Settings page. Go to one.newrelic.com > Mobile > (select an app) > Settings > Application . Troubleshooting If you have problems removing an app, here are some possible causes and suggested solutions: You are not an admin on your full user account If you don't have proper permissions, you won't be able to remove an application. You have not waited long enough All app data must stop reporting to New Relic before you can remove that entity from New Relic. In most cases, this takes between 10-15 minutes. In rare cases, it can take a few minutes longer. Not all agents are disabled If you have multiple agents reporting data under the same UI name, then you must make sure you disable or uninstall all of the agents associated with that entity. You have problems removing your PHP app If you have a PHP app and aren't able to remove it from the UI, possible causes include: You have not disabled both components of the PHP agent. You must stop or uninstall both newrelic.so and newrelic-daemon in order to be able to remove a PHP app. For more information, see New Relic daemon processes. You have set up per-directory monitoring of your PHP app, and unexpected PHP data is reporting as the default PHP application in the New Relic UI. To fix this, change the default app name in the PHP agent config. You don't know where the app's data is coming from If you don't know where an app's data is coming from, it may be because the app's name has been changed. When an app name is changed in the UI, it does not change the underlying app name being reported; it only changes how the app name appears in the UI. To see if there is a difference between the reported name and the displayed name: From one.newrelic.com, select APM, then select an application. Scroll down to Settings and select Application. Compare the name in the Application alias field to the name in the Your application still reports as message directly beneath it. To get host information about an app you are not familiar with: From one.newrelic.com, select APM, then select an application. From the summary view, review the Servers list. Once you have identified where app data is coming from, you can remove the app from New Relic. Browser data is still reporting To remove an app from New Relic, all data must have stopped reporting, including browser monitoring data. To verify that you have disabled or uninstalled the APM agent associated with the app: Ensure that browser monitoring is disabled. If your browser monitoring script is inserted by the APM agent, turn it off from inside the UI, in the agent's config file, or in both. If you copied and pasted the monitoring JavaScript snippet in certain pages, remove that JavaScript snippet manually. Ensure all caches have been cleared that the application uses, such as host caches, CDNs, or anything else that caches built pages. Optional: To see a count of how many page views report from each domain, use this NRQL query: SELECT count(*) FROM PageView WHERE appName = 'YOUR_BROWSER_APP_NAME' FACET domain Copy If these steps don't resolve the issue, it is likely due to an end-user's browser cache that hasn't yet cleared. Wait until those caches clear. If your app has internal users, you may be able to identify the users and clear those caches. For more help",

      "body": "Deploying an app can be a risky event—when your app breaks, a bad deployment is often the cause. New Relic allows you to track deployments so you can correlate deploy to your app's performance. Tracking deployments creates deployment markers that appear in APM charts. Options for tracking deployments You can use the New Relic REST API v2 to record new deployments, retrieve a list of past deployments, and delete past deployments on your APM application. In addition, some APM agents have agent-specific methods to record deployments automatically. You can use your Slack integration with New Relic, or a simple webhook, to notify your team in real time of deployments for applications monitored by APM. Slack provides a webhook URL that allows you to post generic JSON that will appear formatted in a chosen Slack channel. There are a few places where you can view deployments in the New Relic UI after they have been recorded. You can view deployments in the UI: In the activity feed of the APM Summary, New Relic One Service summary, and entity summary pages. On APM performance charts as a chart marker. On the Deployments page for summary performance. Tip Deployment markers are not available for Browser applications, but see Browser releases for a way to tag errors with release versions. Record deployments with the REST API You can use the New Relic REST API v2 to record deployments, get a list of past deployments, and delete deployments. The examples in this document use curl as a command line tool. However, you can use any method to make your REST requests. You can also create, view, and delete deployments with the API Explorer. JSON uses double quotes \" for element names and content. Using single quotes ' will cause errors. Record a deployment with POST To record a new deployment, send a POST request that includes your API key to the deployments endpoint. Attach the payload in JSON format (see Character limits and JSON parameters). All payload parameters are optional except revision. For example: curl -X POST \"https://api.newrelic.com/v2/applications/$APP_ID/deployments.json\" \\ -H \"Api-Key:$API_KEY\" \\ -i \\ -H \"Content-Type: application/json\" \\ -d \\ '{ \"deployment\": { \"revision\": \"REVISION\", \"changelog\": \"Added: /v2/deployments.rb, Removed: None\", \"description\": \"Added a deployments resource to the v2 API\", \"user\": \"datanerd@example.com\", \"timestamp\": \"2019-10-08T00:15:36Z\" } }' Copy Record a deployment with PowerShell To record a deployment with PowerShell, send a POST request that includes your API key to the deployments endpoint. Attach the payload in JSON format (see Character limits and JSON parameters). All payload parameters are optional except revision. This example uses PowerShell version 3 or higher: Invoke-WebRequest -Uri https://api.newrelic.com/v2/applications/YOUR_APP_ID/deployments.json -Method POST -Headers @{'Api-Key'='$API_KEY'} -ContentType 'application/json' -Body '{ \"deployment\": { \"revision\": \"REVISION\", \"changelog\": \"Added: /v2/deployments.rb, Removed: None\", \"description\": \"Added a deployments resource to the v2 API\", \"user\": \"datanerd@example.com\", \"timestamp\": \"2019-10-08T00:15:36Z\" } }' Copy This example uses PowerShell version 2 (requires .NET framework 3.5 or higher): $encoding = [System.Text.Encoding]::GetEncoding(\"ASCII\") $data ='{ \"deployment\": { \"revision\": \"REVISION\", \"changelog\": \"Added: /v2/deployments.rb, Removed: None\", \"description\": \"Added a deployments resource to the v2 API\", \"user\": \"datanerd@example.com\", \"timestamp\": \"2019-10-08T00:15:36Z\" } }' $postData = $encoding.GetBytes($data) $request = [System.Net.WebRequest]::Create('https://api.newrelic.com/v2/applications/$APP_ID/deployments.json') $request.Method = 'POST' $request.Headers.add('Api-Key','$API_KEY') $request.ContentType='application/json' $stream = $request.GetRequestStream() $stream.Write($postData,0,$postData.Length) $request.GetResponse() Copy View a list of deployments with GET To retrieve a list of all past deployments for your app, send a GET request that includes your API key to the deployments endpoint. GET requests do not use a JSON payload. For example: curl -X GET \"https://api.newrelic.com/v2/applications/$APP_ID/deployments.json\" \\ -H \"Api-Key:$API_KEY\" \\ -i Copy Sample output from GET This example requests a list of deployments for app ID 9999999: curl -X GET \"https://api.newrelic.com/v2/applications/9999999/deployments.json\" \\ -H \"Api-Key:ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXabcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwx\" \\ -i Copy The API returns this list of deployments: HTTP/1.1 200 OK ETag: \"ABCDEFGHIJKabcdefghijk0123456789\" Cache-Control: max-age=0, private, must-revalidate Content-Type: application/json { \"deployments\": [ { \"id\": 1234567, \"revision\": \"1234123412341234123412341234123412341234\", \"changelog\": \"Fixed the bugs for real this time\", \"description\": \"Example description two\", \"user\": \"Data Nerd\", \"timestamp\": \"2016-02-24T10:09:27-08:00\", \"links\": { \"application\": 9999999 } }, { \"id\": 2345678, \"revision\": \"7890789078907890789078907890789078907890\", \"changelog\": \"Think I fixed all the bugs\", \"description\": null, \"user\": \"Dren Atad\", \"timestamp\": \"2014-10-22T12:23:47-07:00\", \"links\": { \"application\": 9999999 } } ], \"links\": { \"deployment.agent\": \"/v2/applications/{application_id}\" } } Copy Delete a deployment with DELETE To delete a deployment, send a DELETE request that includes your API key to the deployments endpoint. DELETE requests do not use a JSON payload, but you must specify the ID for the deployment you want to delete. To retrieve the ID for a deployment, use the GET request. For example: curl -X DELETE \"https://api.newrelic.com/v2/applications/$APP_ID/deployments/$DEPLOYMENT_ID.json\" \\ -H \"Api-Key:$API_KEY\" \\ -i Copy Character limits and JSON parameters The JSON payload can include the following parameters. Important UTF-8 4 byte characters, such as Emojis and some non-Latin language glyphs, cannot be used in the deployment text. Parameter Data type Description revision String, 127 character maximum Required. A unique ID for this deployment, visible in the Summary page and on the Deployments page. Can be any string, but is usually a version number or a Git checksum. changelog String, 65535 character maximum Optional. A summary of what changed in this deployment, visible in the Deployments page when you select (selected deployment) > Change log. description String, 65535 character maximum Optional. A high-level description of this deployment, visible in the Summary page and on the Deployments page when you select an individual deployment. user String, 31 character maximum Optional. A username to associate with the deployment, visible in the Summary page and on the Deployments page. timestamp ISO 8601 Optional. When the deployment occurred, down to the second. If not specified, the deployment will be recorded at the time when the API call was received. Timestamp requirements: Must be in UTC time. Must be after the most recent deployment timestamp. Cannot be in the future. Must be in ISO8601 format; for example, \"2019-10-08T00:15:36Z\". Record deployments using the New Relic agent Some agents have additional methods to record deployments: All agents: Use the New Relic REST API v2. C: No SDK-specific methods. Use the REST API. Go: No agent-specific methods. Use the REST API. Java: Call the Java agent jar. .NET: Use PowerShell and the REST API. Node.js: No agent-specific methods. Use the REST API. PHP: Use a PHP script. Python: Use the record-deploy subcommand of the newrelic-admin script. Ruby: Use a Capistrano recipe. Notify your team of deployments After a deployment is recorded using the REST API, you can optionally notify a webhook endpoint of the deployment. The destination of the webhook can be your Slack instance. To use webhooks to set up a deployment notification for a Slack channel: Log in to your Slack account as an admin, then go to App directory > Manage > Apps. Search for your New Relic app, then select Add configuration. From Post to channel, select an existing Slack channel or add a new channel, then Add configuration. From the list of options, copy the webhook URL. Go to one.newrelic.com > (account dropdown) > Account settings > Integrations > Deploy notifications > Webhook. Paste the Slack webhook URL, then save. Optional: Send a test message. Tip You can also use webhooks, Slack channels, and other options for alert notifications with New Relic Alerts. End of life notification: Hipchat, Campfire As of September 9, 2019, integrations with Hipchat and Campfire for APM deployment notifications will no longer be available. Recommendation: If you are still using Hipchat or Campfire, use webhooks with Slack channels instead. For more information, see the New Relic Explorers Hub post.",

      "body": "Applications are automatically removed from New Relic after 93 days without sending data to our platform. You can also remove an application using the UI, once it has stopped sending data. Key metrics will continue to be available via the New Relic REST API, with the application name remaining reserved. For more information, see Inactive apps in New Relic One and our data retention guidelines. Before attempting to remove an app Before attempting to remove an APM, browser, or mobile app from the New Relic UI, keep in mind: You can downgrade your account to pay less or make it entirely free. To remove an app, you must have a user role with that capability. If an agent is still sending data from an app, you cannot remove an app. Remove an application from New Relic Before removing an APM, browser, or mobile application from New Relic, stop the application from sending data either by disabling the agent or by uninstalling it completely. APM applications Disable the APM agent: C SDK: Do a quick recompile and deploy. For example, surround your instrumentation in #ifdef, and set the value of YOURNAMESPACE_NEWRELIC_ENABLED with your build system. Go: Set Enabled to false. Java: Set agent_enabled to false. .NET: Set Newrelic.AgentEnabled to false. Node.js: Set agent_enabled to false. PHP: Remove or disable both the newrelic.so and newrelic-daemon components. Set newrelic.enabled to false. Python: Set monitor_mode to false. Ruby: Set agent_enabled to false. Restart the application server and wait up to ten minutes. Verify the color-coded health status for the app has turned to gray and is no longer reporting data. To remove the APM application and any browser applications linked to it, you have two options: Click the Delete application button on the APM application/service's Settings page. Go to one.newrelic.com > APM > (select an app/service) > Settings > Application. Or, call the /applications/delete endpoint of the New Relic REST API. For example: curl -X DELETE 'https://api.newrelic.com/v2/applications/YOUR_APP_ID.json' \\ -H 'X-Api-Key:YOUR_API_KEY' -i Copy Browser If you've used the copy/paste method to install the browser agent, remove the JavaScript snippet from your application's pages. After 93 days, the application will be removed from New Relic. Tip If browser data continues to be reported, see our suggestions below. Once your browser application has stopped reporting, you have two ways to remove it: If your browser application is linked to an APM application, deleting the APM application also removes the browser application. See the instructions for deleting an APM application/service above for details. Or, click the Delete application button on the browser application's Application settings page. Go to one.newrelic.com > Browser > (select an app) > Settings > Application settings . Mobile Remove all references/dependencies to the New Relic's mobile SDK/frameworks, then rebuild the application. For more information, see the iOS and Android install docs. After 93 days, the application will be removed from New Relic. Or, once your mobile application has stopped reporting, you can also remove it manually: Click the Delete application button on the mobile application's Settings page. Go to one.newrelic.com > Mobile > (select an app) > Settings > Application . Troubleshooting If you have problems removing an app, here are some possible causes and suggested solutions: You are not an admin on your full user account If you don't have proper permissions, you won't be able to remove an application. You have not waited long enough All app data must stop reporting to New Relic before you can remove that entity from New Relic. In most cases, this takes between 10-15 minutes. In rare cases, it can take a few minutes longer. Not all agents are disabled If you have multiple agents reporting data under the same UI name, then you must make sure you disable or uninstall all of the agents associated with that entity. You have problems removing your PHP app If you have a PHP app and aren't able to remove it from the UI, possible causes include: You have not disabled both components of the PHP agent. You must stop or uninstall both newrelic.so and newrelic-daemon in order to be able to remove a PHP app. For more information, see New Relic daemon processes. You have set up per-directory monitoring of your PHP app, and unexpected PHP data is reporting as the default PHP application in the New Relic UI. To fix this, change the default app name in the PHP agent config. You don't know where the app's data is coming from If you don't know where an app's data is coming from, it may be because the app's name has been changed. When an app name is changed in the UI, it does not change the underlying app name being reported; it only changes how the app name appears in the UI. To see if there is a difference between the reported name and the displayed name: From one.newrelic.com, select APM, then select an application. Scroll down to Settings and select Application. Compare the name in the Application alias field to the name in the Your application still reports as message directly beneath it. To get host information about an app you are not familiar with: From one.newrelic.com, select APM, then select an application. From the summary view, review the Servers list. Once you have identified where app data is coming from, you can remove the app from New Relic. Browser data is still reporting To remove an app from New Relic, all data must have stopped reporting, including browser monitoring data. To verify that you have disabled or uninstalled the APM agent associated with the app: Ensure that browser monitoring is disabled. If your browser monitoring script is inserted by the APM agent, turn it off from inside the UI, in the agent's config file, or in both. If you copied and pasted the monitoring JavaScript snippet in certain pages, remove that JavaScript snippet manually. Ensure all caches have been cleared that the application uses, such as host caches, CDNs, or anything else that caches built pages. Optional: To see a count of how many page views report from each domain, use this NRQL query: SELECT count(*) FROM PageView WHERE appName = 'YOUR_BROWSER_APP_NAME' FACET domain Copy If these steps don't resolve the issue, it is likely due to an end-user's browser cache that hasn't yet cleared. Wait until those caches clear. If your app has internal users, you may be able to identify the users and clear those caches. For more help",

      "body": "You may want to temporarily disable an APM agent for the purposes of testing or troubleshooting. This document explains procedures for temporarily turning off the APM agent. Related procedures: To permanently disable APM, uninstall the agent. To configure an agent to monitor some things but not others, use custom instrumentation. Disable the APM agent Select your agent type for instructions: C SDK The C SDK cannot be turned on or off directly. However, you can write your code for the SDK so that a quick recompile and deploy can enable or disable your instrumentation. Follow standard procedures to disable or uninstall the C SDK. Go There are two main ways to disable the Go agent: Remove the import of the github.com/newrelic/go-agent package from your application, and remove or comment out any calls to the newrelic namespace. Then, recompile and restart your app. Use the enabled configuration setting. Then, recompile and restart your app. (This will not reduce overhead because the instrumentation is still running; it will only prevent the sending of data to the New Relic collector.) Tip After you disable the agent, it may take several minutes for data to stop showing up. Java There are three main ways to disable the Java agent: Set agent_enabled to false, then restart the JVM. Use the JVM command line flag: -Dnewrelic.config.agent_enabled=false Copy Then restart the JVM. Remove the newrelic.jar or newrelic.yml file, then restart the JVM. Tip After you disable the agent, it may take several minutes for data to stop showing up. .NET The method to disable the agent depends on if you are using Framework or Core: .NET Framework: Set agentEnabled to false in the global newrelic.config file, found in C:\\ProgramData\\New Relic\\.NET Agent\\. If the application is IIS-hosted, restart IIS. If it's self-hosted (non-IIS), restart the application. .NET Core: Set agentEnabled to false in the newrelic.config file found in the Core agent’s installation directory (for Windows alongside NewRelic.Profiler.dll and for Linux alongside NewRelic.Profiler.so). If you use the ASP.NET Core Module, reset IIS. Otherwise, restart your Core application. Tip After you disable the agent, it may take several minutes for data to stop showing up. Node.js There are two main ways to disable the Node.js agent: Set agent_enabled to false in your agent config file, then restart the app server. Set the NEW_RELIC_ENABLED environment variable to false. Tip After you disable the agent, it may take several minutes for data to stop showing up. PHP To disable the PHP agent, set the enabled config setting to false, then restart the web server or PHP. Tip After you disable the agent, it may take several minutes for data to stop showing up. Python There are three main ways to disable the Python agent, depending on your preference and setup: Standard install: Use the monitor_mode configuration setting. This can be done by editing the config file or by using an environment variable. Standard install with newrelic-admin script: Remove reference to that script in your application. Manual instrumentation: Remove the initialization script from your application. Tip After you disable the agent, it may take several minutes for data to stop showing up. Ruby There are several ways to disable the Ruby agent, depending on your preference and setup. These methods will remove most instrumentation but there will still be a small amount of activity and overhead: Use the agent_enabled configuration setting. This can be done in the configuration file or in the per-environment stanzas. Restart your app server afterward. Do the same via an environment variable, then restart the app server. The following methods will remove all instrumentation and overhead: Remove newrelic_rpm from the Gemfile and bundle install. Set the following in the Gemfile and bundle install: gem 'newrelic_rpm', :require => false Copy This option ensures the gem is installed if it's required somewhere in the app, but doesn't install it when bundling.

      "body": "Deploying an app can be a risky event—when your app breaks, a bad deployment is often the cause. New Relic allows you to track deployments so you can correlate deploy to your app's performance. Tracking deployments creates deployment markers that appear in APM charts. Options for tracking deployments You can use the New Relic REST API v2 to record new deployments, retrieve a list of past deployments, and delete past deployments on your APM application. In addition, some APM agents have agent-specific methods to record deployments automatically. You can use your Slack integration with New Relic, or a simple webhook, to notify your team in real time of deployments for applications monitored by APM. Slack provides a webhook URL that allows you to post generic JSON that will appear formatted in a chosen Slack channel. There are a few places where you can view deployments in the New Relic UI after they have been recorded. You can view deployments in the UI: In the activity feed of the APM Summary, New Relic One Service summary, and entity summary pages. On APM performance charts as a chart marker. On the Deployments page for summary performance. Tip Deployment markers are not available for Browser applications, but see Browser releases for a way to tag errors with release versions. Record deployments with the REST API You can use the New Relic REST API v2 to record deployments, get a list of past deployments, and delete deployments. The examples in this document use curl as a command line tool. However, you can use any method to make your REST requests. You can also create, view, and delete deployments with the API Explorer. JSON uses double quotes \" for element names and content. Using single quotes ' will cause errors. Record a deployment with POST To record a new deployment, send a POST request that includes your API key to the deployments endpoint. Attach the payload in JSON format (see Character limits and JSON parameters). All payload parameters are optional except revision. For example: curl -X POST \"https://api.newrelic.com/v2/applications/$APP_ID/deployments.json\" \\ -H \"Api-Key:$API_KEY\" \\ -i \\ -H \"Content-Type: application/json\" \\ -d \\ '{ \"deployment\": { \"revision\": \"REVISION\", \"changelog\": \"Added: /v2/deployments.rb, Removed: None\", \"description\": \"Added a deployments resource to the v2 API\", \"user\": \"datanerd@example.com\", \"timestamp\": \"2019-10-08T00:15:36Z\" } }' Copy Record a deployment with PowerShell To record a deployment with PowerShell, send a POST request that includes your API key to the deployments endpoint. Attach the payload in JSON format (see Character limits and JSON parameters). All payload parameters are optional except revision. This example uses PowerShell version 3 or higher: Invoke-WebRequest -Uri https://api.newrelic.com/v2/applications/YOUR_APP_ID/deployments.json -Method POST -Headers @{'Api-Key'='$API_KEY'} -ContentType 'application/json' -Body '{ \"deployment\": { \"revision\": \"REVISION\", \"changelog\": \"Added: /v2/deployments.rb, Removed: None\", \"description\": \"Added a deployments resource to the v2 API\", \"user\": \"datanerd@example.com\", \"timestamp\": \"2019-10-08T00:15:36Z\" } }' Copy This example uses PowerShell version 2 (requires .NET framework 3.5 or higher): $encoding = [System.Text.Encoding]::GetEncoding(\"ASCII\") $data ='{ \"deployment\": { \"revision\": \"REVISION\", \"changelog\": \"Added: /v2/deployments.rb, Removed: None\", \"description\": \"Added a deployments resource to the v2 API\", \"user\": \"datanerd@example.com\", \"timestamp\": \"2019-10-08T00:15:36Z\" } }' $postData = $encoding.GetBytes($data) $request = [System.Net.WebRequest]::Create('https://api.newrelic.com/v2/applications/$APP_ID/deployments.json') $request.Method = 'POST' $request.Headers.add('Api-Key','$API_KEY') $request.ContentType='application/json' $stream = $request.GetRequestStream() $stream.Write($postData,0,$postData.Length) $request.GetResponse() Copy View a list of deployments with GET To retrieve a list of all past deployments for your app, send a GET request that includes your API key to the deployments endpoint. GET requests do not use a JSON payload. For example: curl -X GET \"https://api.newrelic.com/v2/applications/$APP_ID/deployments.json\" \\ -H \"Api-Key:$API_KEY\" \\ -i Copy Sample output from GET This example requests a list of deployments for app ID 9999999: curl -X GET \"https://api.newrelic.com/v2/applications/9999999/deployments.json\" \\ -H \"Api-Key:ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXabcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwx\" \\ -i Copy The API returns this list of deployments: HTTP/1.1 200 OK ETag: \"ABCDEFGHIJKabcdefghijk0123456789\" Cache-Control: max-age=0, private, must-revalidate Content-Type: application/json { \"deployments\": [ { \"id\": 1234567, \"revision\": \"1234123412341234123412341234123412341234\", \"changelog\": \"Fixed the bugs for real this time\", \"description\": \"Example description two\", \"user\": \"Data Nerd\", \"timestamp\": \"2016-02-24T10:09:27-08:00\", \"links\": { \"application\": 9999999 } }, { \"id\": 2345678, \"revision\": \"7890789078907890789078907890789078907890\", \"changelog\": \"Think I fixed all the bugs\", \"description\": null, \"user\": \"Dren Atad\", \"timestamp\": \"2014-10-22T12:23:47-07:00\", \"links\": { \"application\": 9999999 } } ], \"links\": { \"deployment.agent\": \"/v2/applications/{application_id}\" } } Copy Delete a deployment with DELETE To delete a deployment, send a DELETE request that includes your API key to the deployments endpoint. DELETE requests do not use a JSON payload, but you must specify the ID for the deployment you want to delete. To retrieve the ID for a deployment, use the GET request. For example: curl -X DELETE \"https://api.newrelic.com/v2/applications/$APP_ID/deployments/$DEPLOYMENT_ID.json\" \\ -H \"Api-Key:$API_KEY\" \\ -i Copy Character limits and JSON parameters The JSON payload can include the following parameters. Important UTF-8 4 byte characters, such as Emojis and some non-Latin language glyphs, cannot be used in the deployment text. Parameter Data type Description revision String, 127 character maximum Required. A unique ID for this deployment, visible in the Summary page and on the Deployments page. Can be any string, but is usually a version number or a Git checksum. changelog String, 65535 character maximum Optional. A summary of what changed in this deployment, visible in the Deployments page when you select (selected deployment) > Change log. description String, 65535 character maximum Optional. A high-level description of this deployment, visible in the Summary page and on the Deployments page when you select an individual deployment. user String, 31 character maximum Optional. A username to associate with the deployment, visible in the Summary page and on the Deployments page. timestamp ISO 8601 Optional. When the deployment occurred, down to the second. If not specified, the deployment will be recorded at the time when the API call was received. Timestamp requirements: Must be in UTC time. Must be after the most recent deployment timestamp. Cannot be in the future. Must be in ISO8601 format; for example, \"2019-10-08T00:15:36Z\". Record deployments using the New Relic agent Some agents have additional methods to record deployments: All agents: Use the New Relic REST API v2. C: No SDK-specific methods. Use the REST API. Go: No agent-specific methods. Use the REST API. Java: Call the Java agent jar. .NET: Use PowerShell and the REST API. Node.js: No agent-specific methods. Use the REST API. PHP: Use a PHP script. Python: Use the record-deploy subcommand of the newrelic-admin script. Ruby: Use a Capistrano recipe. Notify your team of deployments After a deployment is recorded using the REST API, you can optionally notify a webhook endpoint of the deployment. The destination of the webhook can be your Slack instance. To use webhooks to set up a deployment notification for a Slack channel: Log in to your Slack account as an admin, then go to App directory > Manage > Apps. Search for your New Relic app, then select Add configuration. From Post to channel, select an existing Slack channel or add a new channel, then Add configuration. From the list of options, copy the webhook URL. Go to one.newrelic.com > (account dropdown) > Account settings > Integrations > Deploy notifications > Webhook. Paste the Slack webhook URL, then save. Optional: Send a test message. Tip You can also use webhooks, Slack channels, and other options for alert notifications with New Relic Alerts. End of life notification: Hipchat, Campfire As of September 9, 2019, integrations with Hipchat and Campfire for APM deployment notifications will no longer be available. Recommendation: If you are still using Hipchat or Campfire, use webhooks with Slack channels instead. For more information, see the New Relic Explorers Hub post.",

      "body": "You may want to temporarily disable an APM agent for the purposes of testing or troubleshooting. This document explains procedures for temporarily turning off the APM agent. Related procedures: To permanently disable APM, uninstall the agent. To configure an agent to monitor some things but not others, use custom instrumentation. Disable the APM agent Select your agent type for instructions: C SDK The C SDK cannot be turned on or off directly. However, you can write your code for the SDK so that a quick recompile and deploy can enable or disable your instrumentation. Follow standard procedures to disable or uninstall the C SDK. Go There are two main ways to disable the Go agent: Remove the import of the github.com/newrelic/go-agent package from your application, and remove or comment out any calls to the newrelic namespace. Then, recompile and restart your app. Use the enabled configuration setting. Then, recompile and restart your app. (This will not reduce overhead because the instrumentation is still running; it will only prevent the sending of data to the New Relic collector.) Tip After you disable the agent, it may take several minutes for data to stop showing up. Java There are three main ways to disable the Java agent: Set agent_enabled to false, then restart the JVM. Use the JVM command line flag: -Dnewrelic.config.agent_enabled=false Copy Then restart the JVM. Remove the newrelic.jar or newrelic.yml file, then restart the JVM. Tip After you disable the agent, it may take several minutes for data to stop showing up. .NET The method to disable the agent depends on if you are using Framework or Core: .NET Framework: Set agentEnabled to false in the global newrelic.config file, found in C:\\ProgramData\\New Relic\\.NET Agent\\. If the application is IIS-hosted, restart IIS. If it's self-hosted (non-IIS), restart the application. .NET Core: Set agentEnabled to false in the newrelic.config file found in the Core agent’s installation directory (for Windows alongside NewRelic.Profiler.dll and for Linux alongside NewRelic.Profiler.so). If you use the ASP.NET Core Module, reset IIS. Otherwise, restart your Core application. Tip After you disable the agent, it may take several minutes for data to stop showing up. Node.js There are two main ways to disable the Node.js agent: Set agent_enabled to false in your agent config file, then restart the app server. Set the NEW_RELIC_ENABLED environment variable to false. Tip After you disable the agent, it may take several minutes for data to stop showing up. PHP To disable the PHP agent, set the enabled config setting to false, then restart the web server or PHP. Tip After you disable the agent, it may take several minutes for data to stop showing up. Python There are three main ways to disable the Python agent, depending on your preference and setup: Standard install: Use the monitor_mode configuration setting. This can be done by editing the config file or by using an environment variable. Standard install with newrelic-admin script: Remove reference to that script in your application. Manual instrumentation: Remove the initialization script from your application. Tip After you disable the agent, it may take several minutes for data to stop showing up. Ruby There are several ways to disable the Ruby agent, depending on your preference and setup. These methods will remove most instrumentation but there will still be a small amount of activity and overhead: Use the agent_enabled configuration setting. This can be done in the configuration file or in the per-environment stanzas. Restart your app server afterward. Do the same via an environment variable, then restart the app server. The following methods will remove all instrumentation and overhead: Remove newrelic_rpm from the Gemfile and bundle install. Set the following in the Gemfile and bundle install: gem 'newrelic_rpm', :require => false Copy This option ensures the gem is installed if it's required somewhere in the app, but doesn't install it when bundling.

      "body": "Our APM agents and mobile agents have limits on the number of events that can be reported. This document explains: Why event-reporting limits are necessary How sampling works How to work with and understand sampled data Difference between events and metrics This document is about limits on event data and how those limits lead to sampling. First, it may help you to understand the differences between these two types of data: Metrics: aggregated measurements over time. Examples: average response time over a one-minute time range, throughput over time, CPU utilization over time. Events: discrete events that happen at a specific moment in time. Examples: a log or error being reported, or a configuration change. Some events are aggregated over time to form metrics (for example: a count of errors over time). These two types of data have different uses: metrics are useful for recognizing patterns over time in your system, and events are useful for drilling down and getting detail about the causes of those patterns. Because metrics are aggregated over time, they’re useful for spotting trends and changes in system behavior. For metrics that represent an aggregated count of events (like an HTTP response time metric), the individual events give you granular detail about what happened, and let you facet by attributes that have high cardinality (like account or user ID). Why sampling of events is necessary Our APM agents and mobile agents have limits on how many events can be reported per harvest cycle. This is necessary because if there were no limit, a very large number of events being sent could have performance impacts on your application or on New Relic. When the limit is reached, the agents begin sampling events. Different agents have different limits, but the goal is to give a representative sample from across the harvest cycle. Also, agents may sample if they can't connect to New Relic. When an agent can’t connect to New Relic, it continues to store data locally. But it must restrict the size of the payload that is eventually sent. For this reason, it samples events during the disconnected period. The longer it is disconnected, the more it will sample. The impact of sampling One result of sampling is that there can be a discrepancy between unsampled metric data and sampled event data. Examples of this: An APM chart showing unsampled metric data may show you higher throughput than an equivalent NRQL query of sampled event data. For more about the difference between our metric timeslice data and event data, see Data types. A non-New Relic monitoring service may show different results from New Relic. Events that are capped and subject to sampling include: Transaction TransactionError Span (see Distributed tracing sampling) Custom events reported via agent API (example: the .NET agent's RecordCustomEvent) Mobile MobileRequest MobileCrash MobileHandledException Important For APM, you can compensate for sampling when querying data. Change how sampling occurs Before attempting to change how sampling occurs, please read these caveats and recommendations: Reporting more events will result in the agent using more memory. There will usually be a way for you to get the data you need without raising an agent's event-reporting limit. The payload size limit is 1MB (10^6 bytes) (compressed), so the number of events may still be affected by that limit. To determine if events are being dropped, see the agent log for a 413 HTTP status message. Here are some ways to impact sampling: Most agents have configuration options for changing the limit on sampled transactions (examples: Java agent’s max_samples_stored or the Android mobile agent’s setMaxEventPoolSize). If it’s important to you that a specific app activity not be sampled, you can use the Event API. You could deploy your application across a greater number of instances. Because the limits are per-agent, more agents will mean a larger event reservoir. APM: Compensate for sampling When querying APM-reported events, you can compensate for sampling by using EXTRAPOLATE. This will give you an approximation of what unsampled data looks like.",

      "body": "Problem CPU percent usage data between APM and Infrastructure seems contradictory, or your CPU usage exceeds 100%. Cause CPU usage data for APM is different than CPU usage data for Infrastructure. In APM, CPU percent usage measures aggregate usage of all instances of an application or service on a given server. In Infrastructure, CPU percent usage is measured differently depending on if you are viewing CPU usage in relation to hosts, or to processes. New Relic APM To view your app's CPU usage: Go to one.newrelic.com > (select an app) and see the CPU usage in the hosts list. The number of instances is listed under each host name (for example, 55 instances). APM CPU percent usage measures aggregate CPU usage of all instances of your app or service on a given server. This percentage is affected by the number of instances running across cores on the server. Multiple instances of a service running on one server or in a multi-core environment can produce CPU usage percentages well above 100%. APM calculates the percentage by aggregating CPU time and dividing by clock time: CPU usage = (instance CPU time + instance CPU time + [...]) / (clock time) Copy Example: Upgrading to a quad core processor If you upgrade from a dual processor to a quad processor under the same architecture, you should see roughly the same CPU numbers for the same loads and applications. If New Relic normalized the calculation, the upgrade would appear to produce an abrupt decrease in your CPU usage, even if the number of cycles you are using would be the same. Adding more instances does not make your code more efficient. New Relic Infrastructure To view your individual host CPU usage: Go to one.newrelic.com > Infrastructure and see CPU %. See individual CPU usage in the hosts list. The exact calculation for CPU usage is measured differently depending on if you are viewing CPU usage in relation to hosts, or to processes: Page Calculation details Hosts On the Hosts page, CPU Percent is a derived metric that is part of the SystemSample event. The CPU percentage is not collected by New Relic, but derived from several other metrics. Specifically, the cpuPercent attribute is an aggregation of cpuUserPercent, cpuSystemPercent, cpuIoWaitPercent and cpuStealPercent. The Hosts page shows metrics from a perspective of your whole system. For example, if a server has 32 cores installed and is showing cpuPercent of 50%, 16 of the 32 cores are being used. Processes On the Processes page, CPU percent is scoped to individual processes, rather than hosts. Because of this, the CPU percent metric does not take into account the resources of the entire system. Instead, it shows how much of a single CPU core each process is taking. For example, with a 32-core server, a process showing cpuPercent of 50% is only taking half of a single core, or about 1.5625% of the CPU cycles available on the whole server. This can result in cpuPercent exceeding 100% on the Processes page. When this occurs, the process is demanding more than a single core’s worth of CPU cycles.",

Examples: a log or error being reported, or a configuration change. Some events are aggregated over time to form metrics (for example: a count of errors over time). These two types of data have different uses: metrics are useful for recognizing patterns over time in your system, and events are useful for drilling down and getting detail about the causes of those patterns. Because metrics are aggregated over time, they’re useful for spotting trends and changes in system behavior. For metrics that represent an aggregated count of events (like an HTTP response time metric), the individual events give you granular detail about what happened, and let you facet by attributes that have high cardinality (like account or user ID). Why sampling of events is necessary Our APM agents and mobile agents have limits on how many events can be reported per harvest cycle. This is necessary because if there were no limit, a very large number of events being sent could have performance impacts on your application or on New Relic. When the limit is reached, the agents begin sampling events. Different agents have different limits, but the goal is to give a representative sample from across the harvest cycle. Also, agents may sample if they can't connect to New Relic. When an agent can’t connect to New Relic, it continues to store data locally. But it must restrict the size of the payload that is eventually sent. For this reason, it samples events during the disconnected period. The longer it is disconnected, the more it will sample. The impact of sampling One result of sampling is that there can be a discrepancy between unsampled metric data and sampled event data. Examples of this: An APM chart showing unsampled metric data may show you higher throughput than an equivalent NRQL query of sampled event data. For more about the difference between our metric timeslice data and event data, see Data types. A non-New Relic monitoring service may show different results from New Relic. Events that are capped and subject to sampling include: Transaction TransactionError Span (see Distributed tracing sampling) Custom events reported via agent API (example: the .NET agent's RecordCustomEvent) Mobile MobileRequest MobileCrash MobileHandledException Important For APM, you can compensate for sampling when querying data. Change how sampling occurs Before attempting to change how sampling occurs, please read these caveats and recommendations: Reporting more events will result in the agent using more memory. There will usually be a way for you to get the data you need without raising an agent's event-reporting limit. The payload size limit is 1MB (10^6 bytes) (compressed), so the number of events may still be affected by that limit. To determine if events are being dropped, see the agent log for a 413 HTTP status message. Here are some ways to impact sampling: Most agents have configuration options for changing the limit on sampled transactions (examples: Java agent’s max_samples_stored or the Android mobile agent’s setMaxEventPoolSize). If it’s important to you that a specific app activity not be sampled, you can use the Event API. You could deploy your application across a greater number of instances. Because the limits are per-agent, more agents will mean a larger event reservoir. APM: Compensate for sampling When querying APM-reported events, you can compensate for sampling by using EXTRAPOLATE. This will give you an approximation of what unsampled data looks like.",

      "body": "Problem CPU percent usage data between APM and Infrastructure seems contradictory, or your CPU usage exceeds 100%. Cause CPU usage data for APM is different than CPU usage data for Infrastructure. In APM, CPU percent usage measures aggregate usage of all instances of an application or service on a given server. In Infrastructure, CPU percent usage is measured differently depending on if you are viewing CPU usage in relation to hosts, or to processes. New Relic APM To view your app's CPU usage: Go to one.newrelic.com > (select an app) and see the CPU usage in the hosts list. The number of instances is listed under each host name (for example, 55 instances). APM CPU percent usage measures aggregate CPU usage of all instances of your app or service on a given server. This percentage is affected by the number of instances running across cores on the server. Multiple instances of a service running on one server or in a multi-core environment can produce CPU usage percentages well above 100%. APM calculates the percentage by aggregating CPU time and dividing by clock time: CPU usage = (instance CPU time + instance CPU time + [...]) / (clock time) Copy Example: Upgrading to a quad core processor If you upgrade from a dual processor to a quad processor under the same architecture, you should see roughly the same CPU numbers for the same loads and applications. If New Relic normalized the calculation, the upgrade would appear to produce an abrupt decrease in your CPU usage, even if the number of cycles you are using would be the same. Adding more instances does not make your code more efficient. New Relic Infrastructure To view your individual host CPU usage: Go to one.newrelic.com > Infrastructure and see CPU %. See individual CPU usage in the hosts list. The exact calculation for CPU usage is measured differently depending on if you are viewing CPU usage in relation to hosts, or to processes: Page Calculation details Hosts On the Hosts page, CPU Percent is a derived metric that is part of the SystemSample event. The CPU percentage is not collected by New Relic, but derived from several other metrics. Specifically, the cpuPercent attribute is an aggregation of cpuUserPercent, cpuSystemPercent, cpuIoWaitPercent and cpuStealPercent. The Hosts page shows metrics from a perspective of your whole system. For example, if a server has 32 cores installed and is showing cpuPercent of 50%, 16 of the 32 cores are being used. Processes On the Processes page, CPU percent is scoped to individual processes, rather than hosts. Because of this, the CPU percent metric does not take into account the resources of the entire system. Instead, it shows how much of a single CPU core each process is taking. For example, with a 32-core server, a process showing cpuPercent of 50% is only taking half of a single core, or about 1.5625% of the CPU cycles available on the whole server. This can result in cpuPercent exceeding 100% on the Processes page. When this occurs, the process is demanding more than a single core’s worth of CPU cycles.",

For example, you can create SLA reports going back more than 12 days, weeks, or months. Tip Access to this feature depends on your subscription level. Browser metrics for SLAs Browser metrics for the End user tier are available only if you have enabled New Relic Browser.

SLA tips Comments Requirements When using the cURL command examples, be sure to replace the placeholder text with your account ID, an API key, and the application ID. Time ranges You are not limited to standard day, week, or month time ranges. For example, you can extract metric data for a \"holiday weekend\" from 12/23 to 12/26 or \"the 20 minutes after our site had problems\" or whatever other period interests you. UTC XML time format You must specify the time in UTC XML format, so be sure to adjust for your time zone compared to UTC. For example, New Relic starts at 16:00:00 on the day before the selected data, since New Relic headquarters are in UTC-8. Summary reports When requesting metrics to use with summary reports, include the query string parameter summarize=true (v2) or summary=1 (v1) as shown in the examples. Scaled statistics Your report has some statistics that are scaled in the SLA reports in New Relic's user interface. New Relic changes the scale of page views in your report to show small numbers. Depending on your traffic, typically it might be displayed in thousands, millions, or billions. Recommendation: To avoid a string of zeroes, divide this number appropriately for your own purposes. End user statistics End user statistics will reflect only the calls in which New Relic Browser data was gathered. For example, end user stats may not appear in situations such as: Browsers types Clients (they might have disabled the JavaScript agent, or blocked traffic to New Relic sites for JavaScript code's location Transactions not in one of those categories, in case the page load did not complete for any reason This is why there are fewer (sometimes many fewer) page views in the End User (Browser) data section than in the App server data section. Examples The following sections contain code examples to acquire the data for values described above for the Daily (24hr) SLA statistics in the default GMT/UTC time zone. Adjust the from= and to= for your time range as desired. There are syntactical differences between New Relic's REST API v2 and v1. The examples show how to use each.

      "body": "Here are troubleshooting tips when using cross application traces. This is not the same as using New Relic's distributed tracing feature. Agent versions and protocols Make sure you meet these requirements for your agent's version, protocols, interfaces, or message queue libraries. If you are using a protocol that is not listed here, you will not see a connection between your applications. Agent version Notes C SDK Use distributed tracing. Go 1.11 or higher HTTP, HTTPS Java 3.9.0 or higher HTTP, HTTPs, JMS 1.1, RabbitMQ The Java agent also supports several message queue libraries, including those that use the JMS 1.1 interface. .NET 4.2 or higher HTTP, and supported .NET messaging systems Node.js 2.0.0 or higher HTTP, HTTPS, RabbitMQ PHP 4.19.0 or higher HTTP, HTTPS, and supported PHP message queuing systems Python 2.38.0.31 or higher HTTP, HTTPS, and supported Python message queuing systems Ruby 4.3.0 or higher HTTP, HTTPS, RabbitMQ Config file requirements In general, New Relic's cross application tracing feature is enabled by default. Requirements to change your configuration file vary, depending on your New Relic agent: C SDK (not supported) Go (not supported) Java .NET Node.js (no specific config file settings needed for Node.js) PHP Python Ruby High throughput apps Cross application traces rely on transaction events to associate related transactions. If you have a high throughput application, your agent may reach the maximum number of events that it can record in a minute and will fall back to sampling events. If a transaction’s events are sampled, you may see an incomplete cross application trace, including sometimes only the transactions that you are focused on. If your application has high throughput, some cross application traces will appear incomplete, sometimes with no links. Try viewing a different transaction trace. To reduce or eliminate sampling, you can also adjust the number of transaction events stored in your agent configuration. High throughput apps Troubleshooting tips Java From the transaction_events stanza, adjust the setting for max_samples_stored. Ruby Adjust the setting for analytics_events.max_samples_stored. Proxies If you expect to see a cross application trace link but it consistently does not appear, there may be a proxy or broker between your application’s communication. Cross application tracing relies on HTTP headers and JMS properties being passed from one application to other. HTTP proxies and message brokers sometimes strip those headers. Multi-threaded processing (Java) If one or more of your Java applications uses an async or \"reactive\" programming model, a transaction's activity may span across multiple threads. New Relic supports the Play framework and Servlet Async but not all async frameworks. For unsupported frameworks, activity on other threads is not reported as part of the transaction. Calls to other applications will not be traced. Sub-accounts Currently cross application traces do not cross New Relic accounts. If you have multiple New Relic accounts (including sub-accounts), you will only see traces for applications within one account.",

      "body": "The word transaction can have several different meanings in the software industry. This document explains how the term is used by New Relic and how transactions are reported. What is a transaction? At New Relic, a transaction is defined as one logical unit of work in a software application. Specifically, it refers to the function calls and method calls that make up that unit of work. For APM, it will often refer to a web transaction, which represents activity that happens from when the application receives a web request to when the response is sent. When you install APM in a supported system, it begins automatically reporting web requests and other important functions and methods. To supplement the default level of monitoring, you can set up custom instrumentation to report additional transactions. Some frameworks do not have a natural concept of a transaction. In other words, there are no predefined pathways that can easily be recognized or monitored as transactions. To define transactions in such frameworks, you can use custom instrumentation. Types of transactions Cumulative transaction data appears in APM on the Transactions page. The two main categories of transactions are web and non-web: Web: Transactions are initiated with an HTTP request. For most organizations, these represent customer-centric interactions and thus are the most important transactions to monitor. Non-web: Non-web transactions are not initiated with a web request. They can include non-web worker processes, background processes, scripts, message queue activity, and other tasks. Transaction segments The individual functions and calls that make up a transaction are called segments. For example external service calls and database calls are segments, and both have their own UI pages in APM. The APM Transactions page displays aggregate transaction segment data. To add segments to a transaction, use custom instrumentation. To see the segments of a specific transaction, use transaction traces. Transaction naming For supported frameworks, transaction names can come from various sources, such as the name given to the transaction by the framework, function names detected during the transaction, or a web request's URL. For transactions that produce many names with a similar format, we consolidate those into general transaction categories. For example, a transaction might be displayed as /user/*/control_panel, where the * represents different user names. To rename transactions or adjust how names are consolidated, use custom instrumentation. Monitoring transactions Here are some other ways you can use APM to monitor transactions: If you want to monitor... Use this... Transactions important to your business Create key transactions, which emphasizes them in the UI and lets you set a custom level of monitoring for them. Async activity Follow the procedures to set up asynchronous activity for your specific APM language agent. Activity across applications Linking transactions across applications gives you more detail about business-relevant application activity. For more information, see the documentation about distributed tracing and cross application traces. Tip To get a high-level overview of all your applications and services, use the New Relic Explorer. Query transactions Transactions are available for querying with an in-depth set of default attributes attached. Using these attributes, you can run queries and create custom charts that APM does not provide by default. For information on how to query your data using our UI or NRQL, see Query New Relic data.",

Configure transaction trace settings via agent You can customize your transaction trace settings via New Relic agent configuration files and other \"local\" configuration methods such as environment variables. For more information about transaction trace configuration options, see the specific New Relic language agent's documentation: C SDK Go Java .NET Node PHP Python Ruby Configure transaction traces using server-side configuration The ability to configure transaction traces using server-side configuration depends on the New Relic agent. If server-side configuration is not supported, the transaction trace settings will be visible in the UI but not editable. If server-side configuration settings are available for your New Relic agent, you can see them at the following: one.newrelic.com > APM > (select an app) > Settings > Application > Server-side agent configuration. Transaction trace settings available using server-side configuration will differ depending on the New Relic agent you use. The UI includes descriptions of each. Settings in the UI may include: Transaction tracing and threshold Record SQL, including recording level and input fields Log SQL and stack trace threshold SQL query plans and threshold Error collection, including HTTP code and error class Slow query tracing Thread profiler Cross application tracing Configure traces for specific (key) transactions If you want to monitor or alert on a transaction differently than other transactions, make it a key transaction. This is useful, for example, when you want to set a transaction-specific Apdex that is different from your general Apdex T threshold. Changing a key transaction's Apdex changes the likelihood that it creates a transaction trace. For example: If you want to make it more likely a key transaction would generate transaction traces, lower its Apdex T value. If you want to make a key transaction less likely to be traced, raise its Apdex T value. Important If you have the transaction trace threshold set to a number of seconds, and not to the default Apdex setting, the number-of-seconds threshold will act as the threshold for all transactions, even for key transactions that have custom Apdex settings. Create custom transactions You can create custom transactions for app activity that isn't being automatically captured as a transaction by the New Relic agent. For more information, see Custom instrumentation. Collect HTTP request attributes, parameters For data security reasons, transaction traces do not collect potentially sensitive HTTP request attributes, sometimes called parameters. Traces do collect some basic HTTP request attributes, which New Relic calls agent attributes. To edit attribute collection settings, see the specific New Relic agent: C SDK Go Java .NET Node.js (does not allow HTTP attribute configuration) PHP Python Ruby For more information, see Collect custom attributes. Delete a transaction trace When you delete a transaction trace, it is deleted permanently. Delete a single transaction trace To delete a transaction trace record permanently: Go to one.newrelic.com > APM > (select an app) > Monitor > Transactions. Under Transaction traces click on the trace you want to delete. On the details page, select Delete this trace. Delete all transaction traces To delete all traces for the selected app permanently: Go to one.newrelic.com > APM > (select an app) > Monitor > Transactions. Click Delete all traces. It may take fifteen minutes or more for all transaction trace records to disappear from the UI. To delete all traces for your account, contact us at support.newrelic.com. Tip If you are doing general record cleanup, you may also want to delete databases and slow query traces or error traces. This will remove potentially sensitive data while retaining your other application data (such as Apdex, deployment information, etc.).",

      "body": "New Relic APM's cross application tracing lets you link transactions between your APM-monitored applications. What is cross application tracing? Important Instead of using cross application tracing, we recommend our distributed tracing features. Distributed tracing is an improvement on the cross application tracing feature and is recommended for large, distributed systems. New Relic APM's cross application traces link transactions between APM apps in your service-oriented architecture (SOA). This is useful, for example, to identify performance problems between your own application (the \"calling\" app) and any internal or external services (the \"called\" app), such as traffic to internal services. This helps you to: Spot bottlenecks in your cross application call flows. Understand from end to end how specific transactions are used by other applications and services. Diagnose problems faster and enhance collaboration across teams. Security considerations Cross application tracing relies on three HTTP headers in order to exchange information between the calling and called applications. The first two (X-NewRelic-ID and X-NewRelic-Transaction) appear as HTTP request headers in outgoing requests sent by an instrumented application. The remaining header (X-NewRelic-App-Data) is inserted into the HTTP response if the called application belongs to the same New Relic account as the calling application. New Relic obfuscates all of these headers using an obfuscation scheme identical to what is used for New Relic Browser's configuration for page load timing (sometimes referred to as real user monitoring or RUM) but with a different key. HTTP header Description X-NewRelic-ID (in request header) Contains the account ID and application ID of the application making the call X-NewRelic-Transaction (in request header) Contains information about an individual transaction created by the call (a GUID unique to the calling transaction, along with information about upstream calls that spawned the transaction) X-NewRelic-App-Data (in the response if applicable) Contains information about the called application, including: Account ID Application ID Name of the called transaction Timing information for the called transaction GUID of the called transaction",

For more information about transaction trace configuration options, see the specific New Relic language agent's documentation: C SDK Go Java .NET Node PHP Python Ruby Configure transaction traces using server-side configuration The ability to configure transaction traces using server-side configuration depends on the New Relic agent. If server-side configuration is not supported, the transaction trace settings will be visible in the UI but not editable. If server-side configuration settings are available for your New Relic agent, you can see them at the following: one.newrelic.com > APM > (select an app) > Settings > Application > Server-side agent configuration. Transaction trace settings available using server-side configuration will differ depending on the New Relic agent you use. The UI includes descriptions of each. Settings in the UI may include: Transaction tracing and threshold Record SQL, including recording level and input fields Log SQL and stack trace threshold SQL query plans and threshold Error collection, including HTTP code and error class Slow query tracing Thread profiler Cross application tracing Configure traces for specific (key) transactions If you want to monitor or alert on a transaction differently than other transactions, make it a key transaction. This is useful, for example, when you want to set a transaction-specific Apdex that is different from your general Apdex T threshold. Changing a key transaction's Apdex changes the likelihood that it creates a transaction trace. For example: If you want to make it more likely a key transaction would generate transaction traces, lower its Apdex T value. If you want to make a key transaction less likely to be traced, raise its Apdex T value. Important If you have the transaction trace threshold set to a number of seconds, and not to the default Apdex setting, the number-of-seconds threshold will act as the threshold for all transactions, even for key transactions that have custom Apdex settings. Create custom transactions You can create custom transactions for app activity that isn't being automatically captured as a transaction by the New Relic agent. For more information, see Custom instrumentation. Collect HTTP request attributes, parameters For data security reasons, transaction traces do not collect potentially sensitive HTTP request attributes, sometimes called parameters. Traces do collect some basic HTTP request attributes, which New Relic calls agent attributes. To edit attribute collection settings, see the specific New Relic agent: C SDK Go Java .NET Node.js (does not allow HTTP attribute configuration) PHP Python Ruby For more information, see Collect custom attributes. Delete a transaction trace When you delete a transaction trace, it is deleted permanently. Delete a single transaction trace To delete a transaction trace record permanently: Go to one.newrelic.com > APM > (select an app) > Monitor > Transactions. Under Transaction traces click on the trace you want to delete. On the details page, select Delete this trace. Delete all transaction traces To delete all traces for the selected app permanently: Go to one.newrelic.com > APM > (select an app) > Monitor > Transactions. Click Delete all traces. It may take fifteen minutes or more for all transaction trace records to disappear from the UI. To delete all traces for your account, contact us at support.newrelic.com. Tip If you are doing general record cleanup, you may also want to delete databases and slow query traces or error traces. This will remove potentially sensitive data while retaining your other application data (such as Apdex, deployment information, etc.).",

      "body": "The word transaction can have several different meanings in the software industry. This document explains how the term is used by New Relic and how transactions are reported. What is a transaction? At New Relic, a transaction is defined as one logical unit of work in a software application. Specifically, it refers to the function calls and method calls that make up that unit of work. For APM, it will often refer to a web transaction, which represents activity that happens from when the application receives a web request to when the response is sent. When you install APM in a supported system, it begins automatically reporting web requests and other important functions and methods. To supplement the default level of monitoring, you can set up custom instrumentation to report additional transactions. Some frameworks do not have a natural concept of a transaction. In other words, there are no predefined pathways that can easily be recognized or monitored as transactions. To define transactions in such frameworks, you can use custom instrumentation. Types of transactions Cumulative transaction data appears in APM on the Transactions page. The two main categories of transactions are web and non-web: Web: Transactions are initiated with an HTTP request. For most organizations, these represent customer-centric interactions and thus are the most important transactions to monitor. Non-web: Non-web transactions are not initiated with a web request. They can include non-web worker processes, background processes, scripts, message queue activity, and other tasks. Transaction segments The individual functions and calls that make up a transaction are called segments. For example external service calls and database calls are segments, and both have their own UI pages in APM. The APM Transactions page displays aggregate transaction segment data. To add segments to a transaction, use custom instrumentation. To see the segments of a specific transaction, use transaction traces. Transaction naming For supported frameworks, transaction names can come from various sources, such as the name given to the transaction by the framework, function names detected during the transaction, or a web request's URL. For transactions that produce many names with a similar format, we consolidate those into general transaction categories. For example, a transaction might be displayed as /user/*/control_panel, where the * represents different user names. To rename transactions or adjust how names are consolidated, use custom instrumentation. Monitoring transactions Here are some other ways you can use APM to monitor transactions: If you want to monitor... Use this... Transactions important to your business Create key transactions, which emphasizes them in the UI and lets you set a custom level of monitoring for them. Async activity Follow the procedures to set up asynchronous activity for your specific APM language agent. Activity across applications Linking transactions across applications gives you more detail about business-relevant application activity. For more information, see the documentation about distributed tracing and cross application traces. Tip To get a high-level overview of all your applications and services, use the New Relic Explorer. Query transactions Transactions are available for querying with an in-depth set of default attributes attached. Using these attributes, you can run queries and create custom charts that APM does not provide by default. For information on how to query your data using our UI or NRQL, see Query New Relic data.",

      "body": "In APM, a transaction trace gives a detailed snapshot of a single transaction in your application. A transaction trace records the available function calls, database calls, and external calls. You can use transaction traces to troubleshoot performance issues and to get detailed low-level insight into how your app is working. What transactions record traces In APM, a transaction trace records the segments that make up a transaction. Because they give you more detail, you can use transaction traces to analyze and troubleshoot performance issues. Here are the default rules that govern which transactions a New Relic agent traces: Over the minute-long harvest cycle, all transactions that violate the threshold (either four times your Apdex T value or a specific number of seconds) are added to a pool of transactions. At the end of that minute, the New Relic agent selects the slowest transaction in that pool and performs a transaction trace on it. These are the general rules, but there are some agent-specific differences. For example: The Java agent collects occasional non-slow transactions. If one transaction is frequently traced, some agents will select other transactions to give a more diverse sampling. If you don't see traces in your account, it's possible that no transactions meet the necessary criteria. In this situation, you can adjust transaction trace settings to ensure some transactions will be traced. If you use Synthetic, you will likely have Synthetic monitor traces. Synthetic traces can happen more frequently than APM traces, potentially several per minute. Configure transaction traces To configure or edit trace settings, see the procedures for: Transaction traces Key transaction traces View transaction traces in UI To view transaction traces: Do one of the following: New Relic Explorer: Go to one.newrelic.com > Explorer > (select an app) > Monitor > Transactions. APM: Go to one.newrelic.com > APM > (select an app) > Monitor > Transactions. In the Transaction traces section, click transaction traces to view additional details.

Trace details page functions Go to one.newrelic.com > APM > (select an app) > Monitor > Transactions > (select a transaction trace) > Trace details. The Trace details page displays a table with the timing data for the segments in a transaction, plus additional features and functions: Trace details page Description Primary trace data, functions The top of each transaction trace UI page shows several primary pieces of data, including the trace time, response time, and, if available, CPU info. Also, sometimes the UI may indicate a partial trace. Available functions include: Delete this trace: When you delete a trace, it cannot be retrieved. Track as key transaction. Duration column The duration of each segment and subsegment is shown as both the number of milliseconds and a percentage of the total transaction time. Especially slow segments are color-coded. Segment column The Segment column displays segment names and counts. Fast and repeat calls may be automatically grouped together. Sometimes you may see Application code as the name of a segment or subsegment. To expand segments, use either of the following: The Expand performance problems button at the top of the page The expand and collapse dropdown arrows next to the segments Drilldown column The Drilldown column may contain icons that link to additional transaction data, if available. Timestamp column The Timestamp column displays the start time of a segment or subsegment, relative to the start of the transaction. For example, a value of 3.150 s indicates that that segment started 3.15 seconds into the transaction. Drilldown options In the Drilldown column, icons indicate that additional data is available: Icon Description Database queries The database icon links to the raw database query for that query segment. Depending on your transaction trace settings, this query can either show as raw data or obfuscated data. If the total time for the segment exceeds the query plan threshold in your settings, the query analysis also will appear, along with a stack trace showing the exact location of the call in your code. Stack traces The magnifying glass links to stack trace details. Aggregate transaction details This icon indicates that cross application tracing details are not available. However, you can select this icon to view aggregated transaction information across multiple invocations of the transaction. Color coding of segment duration data The Duration column of the Trace details table is color-coded: Red: More than 25% of the total transaction time was spent in this segment. Yellow: More than 5% of the total transaction time was spent in this segment. Color-coded durations do not necessarily indicate a problem. Whether the timing is actually a problem depends on what you consider normal and acceptable for your application. Application code in traces If a segment is listed as Application code in the table, it indicates that that section of code was not instrumented. You can use custom instrumentation to get more detail on that part of the code. Segments will often be listed as Application code for partial traces. Partial traces For performance reasons, New Relic APM only captures the first 2,000 segments of a transaction trace (900 for Node.js). If a transaction trace exceeds that number of segments, the agent truncates the transaction trace and displays a message at the top of the Details page: This is a partial trace. The New Relic APM agents have differing rules for when to truncate segments. APM agent Truncate segment rules C SDK Truncates based on segment priority: The root segment has the highest priority. Segments that have seen distributed tracing activity have second-highest priority. Slow segments have third-highest priority. For more information, see the C SDK's documentation about newrelic_transaction_tracer_config_t on GitHub. Go The segment duration must be greater than the TransactionTracer.SegmentThreshold value set in your Go segment configuration. Java, .NET, Ruby These agents truncate traces chronologically. For more information, see the transaction tracer documentation for Java, .NET, or Ruby as applicable. Node.js The Node.js agent only captures the first 900 segments of a transaction trace. For more information, see Node.js transaction tracer configuration. PHP Truncates based on segment duration; the slowest 2,000 segments are captured for the trace. For more information, see PHP transaction tracer configuration. Python Truncates based on segment duration; the slowest 2,000 segments are captured for the trace. For more information, see Python transaction tracer configuration. Segment grouping rules Transaction traces that have a lot of segments can be hard to interpret. New Relic helps you by automatically grouping fast and/or repeated method calls into a single segment grouping. For example, you might see a segment titled 7 fast method calls. This means that, because of their fast completion, New Relic assumed these calls were unlikely to be a problem and grouped them together. You can expand that grouping to see the individual segments. Rules underlying segment grouping include: Fast calls: When New Relic detects four or more consecutive segments with a duration of 7.5 ms or less, these are grouped into a single collapsed header. Identical calls: When New Relic detects four or more consecutive identical calls, this usually indicates an N+1 problem. These segments are collapsed. Expanding the collapsed node displays only the first three calls, not all calls.",

      "body": "This document explains what non-web transactions are in APM, and how you can instrument background tasks and other arbitrary activity to be reported as non-web transactions. What are non-web transactions? The two main New Relic APM transaction categories are web and non-web. Web transactions are transactions we detect as being initiated by a web request; they are the most common type of transaction reported by APM. Non-web transactions are transactions that are not web transactions; we do not detect they were initiated by a web request. This includes processes and jobs that do not handle web requests, such as message processing and background tasks. For example, you might schedule something to run periodically on your server to do database work, send emails, etc. The source is not a web request but something on your server. Some non-web transactions from supported frameworks or services are detected automatically by New Relic; others may be created using custom instrumentation. We intentionally separate your web and non-web transactions in the UI. Non-web vs. web transactions Comments Less directly important Non-web transactions are often background processes and tasks, and they are less directly important to your application's users when compared to web transactions. Long running Non-web transactions are often long-running processes. Separating them from web transactions prevents those results from skewing your customer-facing response times. Omitted from Apdex score Combining your non-web transactions with your web transactions would hurt your Apdex score (a measure of satisfaction with load times). This is why Apdex data for non-web transactions does not appear in the UI. Create non-web transactions To create new non-web transactions, follow the procedures for your APM language agent. C SDK Follow the procedures for instrumenting a non-web transaction. Go Follow the procedures for instrumenting a non-web transaction. Java Follow the procedures for instrumenting a transaction (instrumenting a transaction without web request parameters creates a non-web transaction). .NET By default, the APM .NET agent instruments IIS ASP workers. To instrument other (non-IIS) .NET applications, such as standalone (WCF) services, console apps, and other Windows services, see Instrumenting custom applications and Instrumenting WCF applications. Important For IIS applications, you cannot change web transactions to non-web transactions. Node.js Use startBackgroundTransaction(). PHP To mark a transaction as non-web: use newrelic_background_job and set the flag to true. The PHP agent reports all command-line run scripts as non-web transactions. Python See Python agent non-web transactions. The Python agent also supports non-web transaction reporting from Celery and Gearman. Ruby See Ruby agent non-web transactions. View non-web transactions To view non-web transaction data in the New Relic UI, go to the main chart on the following pages, and then select the Non-web option in the dropdown: New Relic Explorer: Go to one.newrelic.com > Explorer > (select an app) > Summary.

Configure transaction traces To configure or edit trace settings, see the procedures for: Transaction traces Key transaction traces View transaction traces in UI To view transaction traces: Do one of the following: New Relic Explorer: Go to one.newrelic.com > Explorer > (select an app) > Monitor > Transactions. APM: Go to one.newrelic.com > APM > (select an app) > Monitor > Transactions. In the Transaction traces section, click transaction traces to view additional details. Troubleshoot an issue with transaction traces If you expect to see transaction traces but do not see them, follow the troubleshooting procedures.

      "body": "In APM, the Trace details tab shows the timing of individual segments in a transaction trace. This document describes the sections and features of the Trace details tab. Trace details page functions Go to one.newrelic.com > APM > (select an app) > Monitor > Transactions > (select a transaction trace) > Trace details. The Trace details page displays a table with the timing data for the segments in a transaction, plus additional features and functions: Trace details page Description Primary trace data, functions The top of each transaction trace UI page shows several primary pieces of data, including the trace time, response time, and, if available, CPU info. Also, sometimes the UI may indicate a partial trace. Available functions include: Delete this trace: When you delete a trace, it cannot be retrieved. Track as key transaction. Duration column The duration of each segment and subsegment is shown as both the number of milliseconds and a percentage of the total transaction time. Especially slow segments are color-coded. Segment column The Segment column displays segment names and counts. Fast and repeat calls may be automatically grouped together. Sometimes you may see Application code as the name of a segment or subsegment. To expand segments, use either of the following: The Expand performance problems button at the top of the page The expand and collapse dropdown arrows next to the segments Drilldown column The Drilldown column may contain icons that link to additional transaction data, if available. Timestamp column The Timestamp column displays the start time of a segment or subsegment, relative to the start of the transaction. For example, a value of 3.150 s indicates that that segment started 3.15 seconds into the transaction. Drilldown options In the Drilldown column, icons indicate that additional data is available: Icon Description Database queries The database icon links to the raw database query for that query segment. Depending on your transaction trace settings, this query can either show as raw data or obfuscated data. If the total time for the segment exceeds the query plan threshold in your settings, the query analysis also will appear, along with a stack trace showing the exact location of the call in your code. Stack traces The magnifying glass links to stack trace details. Aggregate transaction details This icon indicates that cross application tracing details are not available. However, you can select this icon to view aggregated transaction information across multiple invocations of the transaction. Color coding of segment duration data The Duration column of the Trace details table is color-coded: Red: More than 25% of the total transaction time was spent in this segment. Yellow: More than 5% of the total transaction time was spent in this segment. Color-coded durations do not necessarily indicate a problem. Whether the timing is actually a problem depends on what you consider normal and acceptable for your application. Application code in traces If a segment is listed as Application code in the table, it indicates that that section of code was not instrumented. You can use custom instrumentation to get more detail on that part of the code. Segments will often be listed as Application code for partial traces. Partial traces For performance reasons, New Relic APM only captures the first 2,000 segments of a transaction trace (900 for Node.js). If a transaction trace exceeds that number of segments, the agent truncates the transaction trace and displays a message at the top of the Details page: This is a partial trace. The New Relic APM agents have differing rules for when to truncate segments. APM agent Truncate segment rules C SDK Truncates based on segment priority: The root segment has the highest priority. Segments that have seen distributed tracing activity have second-highest priority. Slow segments have third-highest priority. For more information, see the C SDK's documentation about newrelic_transaction_tracer_config_t on GitHub. Go The segment duration must be greater than the TransactionTracer.SegmentThreshold value set in your Go segment configuration. Java, .NET, Ruby These agents truncate traces chronologically. For more information, see the transaction tracer documentation for Java, .NET, or Ruby as applicable. Node.js The Node.js agent only captures the first 900 segments of a transaction trace. For more information, see Node.js transaction tracer configuration. PHP Truncates based on segment duration; the slowest 2,000 segments are captured for the trace. For more information, see PHP transaction tracer configuration. Python Truncates based on segment duration; the slowest 2,000 segments are captured for the trace. For more information, see Python transaction tracer configuration. Segment grouping rules Transaction traces that have a lot of segments can be hard to interpret. New Relic helps you by automatically grouping fast and/or repeated method calls into a single segment grouping. For example, you might see a segment titled 7 fast method calls. This means that, because of their fast completion, New Relic assumed these calls were unlikely to be a problem and grouped them together. You can expand that grouping to see the individual segments. Rules underlying segment grouping include: Fast calls: When New Relic detects four or more consecutive segments with a duration of 7.5 ms or less, these are grouped into a single collapsed header. Identical calls: When New Relic detects four or more consecutive identical calls, this usually indicates an N+1 problem. These segments are collapsed. Expanding the collapsed node displays only the first three calls, not all calls.",

For the PHP, Node.js, and Go agents, only web transactions can be turned into key transactions. What are key transactions? In New Relic APM, making a transaction a key transaction gives you the following benefits: Key transactions are grouped together in the New Relic UI, so they are easy to find and examine. You can set a custom Apdex threshold for a key transaction. You can set an alert policy for a key transaction. Key transactions are useful for: Important transactions. For your app's most important transactions, making them key transactions means you can quickly find and examine them. You can set stricter Apdex requirements for them, and you can create alert policies for them. Slow transactions. If a transaction is regularly slower than other transactions, it can bring down the Apdex score of the entire application. When you make a transaction a key transaction, you can set a longer-duration Apdex threshold for it so it won't bring down your app's Apdex score.

These may be web transactions or non-web transactions that are important to your business. For most New Relic agents, a key transaction can be any type of transaction. For the PHP, Node.js, and Go agents, only web transactions can be turned into key transactions. What are key transactions? In New Relic APM, making a transaction a key transaction gives you the following benefits: Key transactions are grouped together in the New Relic UI, so they are easy to find and examine. You can set a custom Apdex threshold for a key transaction. You can set an alert policy for a key transaction. Key transactions are useful for: Important transactions. For your app's most important transactions, making them key transactions means you can quickly find and examine them. You can set stricter Apdex requirements for them, and you can create alert policies for them. Slow transactions. If a transaction is regularly slower than other transactions, it can bring down the Apdex score of the entire application. When you make a transaction a key transaction, you can set a longer-duration Apdex threshold for it so it won't bring down your app's Apdex score. Create key transactions To create key transactions, see Create and update key transactions. View key transactions in UI The key transaction's page includes response time and throughput charts, service-level agreement information, a cross application tracing map (if available), and links to alert policy options.

This is useful if the transaction is expected to be faster or slower than other transactions. Important Key transaction Apdex settings override the T value set for that app. This can mean, for example, that a key transaction could be reported as Satisfied but a different transaction in the same app with the same response time could be Frustrated. To change a key transaction's Apdex threshold: Go to one.newrelic.com > More > Key transactions. Select the icon for the transaction you want to edit. Enter a new value in seconds under the Apdex T heading, then save. The Apdex threshold affects how key transaction traces are created.

      "body": "In APM, a transaction trace gives a detailed snapshot of a single transaction in your application. A transaction trace records the available function calls, database calls, and external calls. You can use transaction traces to troubleshoot performance issues and to get detailed low-level insight into how your app is working. What transactions record traces In APM, a transaction trace records the segments that make up a transaction. Because they give you more detail, you can use transaction traces to analyze and troubleshoot performance issues. Here are the default rules that govern which transactions a New Relic agent traces: Over the minute-long harvest cycle, all transactions that violate the threshold (either four times your Apdex T value or a specific number of seconds) are added to a pool of transactions. At the end of that minute, the New Relic agent selects the slowest transaction in that pool and performs a transaction trace on it. These are the general rules, but there are some agent-specific differences. For example: The Java agent collects occasional non-slow transactions. If one transaction is frequently traced, some agents will select other transactions to give a more diverse sampling. If you don't see traces in your account, it's possible that no transactions meet the necessary criteria. In this situation, you can adjust transaction trace settings to ensure some transactions will be traced. If you use Synthetic, you will likely have Synthetic monitor traces. Synthetic traces can happen more frequently than APM traces, potentially several per minute. Configure transaction traces To configure or edit trace settings, see the procedures for: Transaction traces Key transaction traces View transaction traces in UI To view transaction traces: Do one of the following: New Relic Explorer: Go to one.newrelic.com > Explorer > (select an app) > Monitor > Transactions. APM: Go to one.newrelic.com > APM > (select an app) > Monitor > Transactions. In the Transaction traces section, click transaction traces to view additional details.

Trace details page functions Go to one.newrelic.com > APM > (select an app) > Monitor > Transactions > (select a transaction trace) > Trace details. The Trace details page displays a table with the timing data for the segments in a transaction, plus additional features and functions: Trace details page Description Primary trace data, functions The top of each transaction trace UI page shows several primary pieces of data, including the trace time, response time, and, if available, CPU info. Also, sometimes the UI may indicate a partial trace. Available functions include: Delete this trace: When you delete a trace, it cannot be retrieved. Track as key transaction. Duration column The duration of each segment and subsegment is shown as both the number of milliseconds and a percentage of the total transaction time. Especially slow segments are color-coded. Segment column The Segment column displays segment names and counts. Fast and repeat calls may be automatically grouped together. Sometimes you may see Application code as the name of a segment or subsegment. To expand segments, use either of the following: The Expand performance problems button at the top of the page The expand and collapse dropdown arrows next to the segments Drilldown column The Drilldown column may contain icons that link to additional transaction data, if available. Timestamp column The Timestamp column displays the start time of a segment or subsegment, relative to the start of the transaction. For example, a value of 3.150 s indicates that that segment started 3.15 seconds into the transaction. Drilldown options In the Drilldown column, icons indicate that additional data is available: Icon Description Database queries The database icon links to the raw database query for that query segment. Depending on your transaction trace settings, this query can either show as raw data or obfuscated data. If the total time for the segment exceeds the query plan threshold in your settings, the query analysis also will appear, along with a stack trace showing the exact location of the call in your code. Stack traces The magnifying glass links to stack trace details. Aggregate transaction details This icon indicates that cross application tracing details are not available. However, you can select this icon to view aggregated transaction information across multiple invocations of the transaction. Color coding of segment duration data The Duration column of the Trace details table is color-coded: Red: More than 25% of the total transaction time was spent in this segment. Yellow: More than 5% of the total transaction time was spent in this segment. Color-coded durations do not necessarily indicate a problem. Whether the timing is actually a problem depends on what you consider normal and acceptable for your application. Application code in traces If a segment is listed as Application code in the table, it indicates that that section of code was not instrumented. You can use custom instrumentation to get more detail on that part of the code. Segments will often be listed as Application code for partial traces. Partial traces For performance reasons, New Relic APM only captures the first 2,000 segments of a transaction trace (900 for Node.js). If a transaction trace exceeds that number of segments, the agent truncates the transaction trace and displays a message at the top of the Details page: This is a partial trace. The New Relic APM agents have differing rules for when to truncate segments. APM agent Truncate segment rules C SDK Truncates based on segment priority: The root segment has the highest priority. Segments that have seen distributed tracing activity have second-highest priority. Slow segments have third-highest priority. For more information, see the C SDK's documentation about newrelic_transaction_tracer_config_t on GitHub. Go The segment duration must be greater than the TransactionTracer.SegmentThreshold value set in your Go segment configuration. Java, .NET, Ruby These agents truncate traces chronologically. For more information, see the transaction tracer documentation for Java, .NET, or Ruby as applicable. Node.js The Node.js agent only captures the first 900 segments of a transaction trace. For more information, see Node.js transaction tracer configuration. PHP Truncates based on segment duration; the slowest 2,000 segments are captured for the trace. For more information, see PHP transaction tracer configuration. Python Truncates based on segment duration; the slowest 2,000 segments are captured for the trace. For more information, see Python transaction tracer configuration. Segment grouping rules Transaction traces that have a lot of segments can be hard to interpret. New Relic helps you by automatically grouping fast and/or repeated method calls into a single segment grouping. For example, you might see a segment titled 7 fast method calls. This means that, because of their fast completion, New Relic assumed these calls were unlikely to be a problem and grouped them together. You can expand that grouping to see the individual segments. Rules underlying segment grouping include: Fast calls: When New Relic detects four or more consecutive segments with a duration of 7.5 ms or less, these are grouped into a single collapsed header. Identical calls: When New Relic detects four or more consecutive identical calls, this usually indicates an N+1 problem. These segments are collapsed. Expanding the collapsed node displays only the first three calls, not all calls.",

Common database query setting changes include: Collecting raw query data instead of obfuscated or turning off query collection Changing the stack trace threshold Turning on query explain plan collection Use database queries to improve performance Here are some tips to improve your app's database performance: Use database queries Comments Time Look for queries where the TOTAL DURATION contributes large amounts of time to the overall transaction time. This indicates a good place to try to enhance your database query with an index or some other optimization. Duplicate queries Look for queries that repeatedly query the same kind of information; for example, multiple queries to look up individual account IDs. Try rewriting the query to INCLUDE the specific values (account IDs 1, 2, 10, 14, 17, etc.) so that a single query can get all the relevant items. Database overhead Look at the structure of your queries to see if there are opportunities to combine different types of information into a single call; for example, querying for the account ID, name, etc. This is useful, for example, if your database center is in a different geographical location, because this will reduce overhead. The amount of time for your database request and response may be very fast. However, by combining requests into fewer calls, you can reduce that time even more. MySQL From your app's main APM Summary page, compare the database time on the main chart to other processing time. Sudden spikes or larger amounts of database time compared to other processing times may indicate problems. Find other slow queries The Trace details page is useful for examining a specific transaction's details. To see all of your application's slowest queries in one place, use the Slow queries feature.",

Partial traces For performance reasons, New Relic APM only captures the first 2,000 segments of a transaction trace (900 for Node.js). If a transaction trace exceeds that number of segments, the agent truncates the transaction trace and displays a message at the top of the Details page: This is a partial trace. The New Relic APM agents have differing rules for when to truncate segments. APM agent Truncate segment rules C SDK Truncates based on segment priority: The root segment has the highest priority. Segments that have seen distributed tracing activity have second-highest priority. Slow segments have third-highest priority. For more information, see the C SDK's documentation about newrelic_transaction_tracer_config_t on GitHub. Go The segment duration must be greater than the TransactionTracer.SegmentThreshold value set in your Go segment configuration. Java, .NET, Ruby These agents truncate traces chronologically. For more information, see the transaction tracer documentation for Java, .NET, or Ruby as applicable. Node.js The Node.js agent only captures the first 900 segments of a transaction trace. For more information, see Node.js transaction tracer configuration. PHP Truncates based on segment duration; the slowest 2,000 segments are captured for the trace. For more information, see PHP transaction tracer configuration. Python Truncates based on segment duration; the slowest 2,000 segments are captured for the trace. For more information, see Python transaction tracer configuration. Segment grouping rules Transaction traces that have a lot of segments can be hard to interpret. New Relic helps you by automatically grouping fast and/or repeated method calls into a single segment grouping. For example, you might see a segment titled 7 fast method calls. This means that, because of their fast completion, New Relic assumed these calls were unlikely to be a problem and grouped them together. You can expand that grouping to see the individual segments. Rules underlying segment grouping include: Fast calls: When New Relic detects four or more consecutive segments with a duration of 7.5 ms or less, these are grouped into a single collapsed header. Identical calls: When New Relic detects four or more consecutive identical calls, this usually indicates an N+1 problem. These segments are collapsed. Expanding the collapsed node displays only the first three calls, not all calls.",

Configure database query settings You can change database query settings in the same way you change other transaction trace settings; for example, via configuring the New Relic agent or, for some agents, via the UI. Common database query setting changes include: Collecting raw query data instead of obfuscated or turning off query collection Changing the stack trace threshold Turning on query explain plan collection Use database queries to improve performance Here are some tips to improve your app's database performance: Use database queries Comments Time Look for queries where the TOTAL DURATION contributes large amounts of time to the overall transaction time. This indicates a good place to try to enhance your database query with an index or some other optimization. Duplicate queries Look for queries that repeatedly query the same kind of information; for example, multiple queries to look up individual account IDs. Try rewriting the query to INCLUDE the specific values (account IDs 1, 2, 10, 14, 17, etc.) so that a single query can get all the relevant items. Database overhead Look at the structure of your queries to see if there are opportunities to combine different types of information into a single call; for example, querying for the account ID, name, etc. This is useful, for example, if your database center is in a different geographical location, because this will reduce overhead. The amount of time for your database request and response may be very fast. However, by combining requests into fewer calls, you can reduce that time even more. MySQL From your app's main APM Summary page, compare the database time on the main chart to other processing time. Sudden spikes or larger amounts of database time compared to other processing times may indicate problems. Find other slow queries The Trace details page is useful for examining a specific transaction's details. To see all of your application's slowest queries in one place, use the Slow queries feature.",

      "body": "APM transaction traces collect detailed data about your application's transactions. Because they collect detailed data from your app, transaction traces can be a potential security concern. This document explains how to configure transaction traces for your data security needs. Database queries The database query types collected by transaction traces vary by New Relic language agent. Query collection is a potential security and/or privacy concern because queries can contain sensitive values. You can customize database query collection with three different security settings: Obfuscated: This is the default value. This setting strips string literals and numeric sequences from your queries and replaces them with the ? character. For example: the query select * from table where ssn='123-45-6789' would become select * from table where ssn=?. Off: Query collection is turned off entirely. Raw: If you are confident that full query data collection will not impact your data security or your users' privacy, you can change the setting to Raw, which will record all query values. You can edit database query collection with the Record SQL setting, explained in Configure transaction traces. HTTP request attributes and parameters The collection of HTTP request data can expose potentially sensitive data. New Relic calls the key/value data collected during an HTTP request attributes. By default, the collection of attributes is limited to only basic HTTP information that is not a source of sensitive data (for example, response code and host); these are part of the group of basic attributes that New Relic refers to as agent attributes. For data security reasons, the collection of other attributes, including user-specific parameters, is disabled by default. For information on how to enable/disable the collection of specific HTTP attributes and custom attributes, see Configure transaction traces. High security mode New Relic's default settings provide a high level of security. To force the most secure settings for all the applications in your account, you can use the high security mode. This mode ensures that, no matter how your admins and users configure your account, the most secure settings are forced and cannot be overridden. For more information, see High security mode.",

      "body": "In APM, a transaction trace gives a detailed snapshot of a single transaction in your application. A transaction trace records the available function calls, database calls, and external calls. You can use transaction traces to troubleshoot performance issues and to get detailed low-level insight into how your app is working. What transactions record traces In APM, a transaction trace records the segments that make up a transaction. Because they give you more detail, you can use transaction traces to analyze and troubleshoot performance issues. Here are the default rules that govern which transactions a New Relic agent traces: Over the minute-long harvest cycle, all transactions that violate the threshold (either four times your Apdex T value or a specific number of seconds) are added to a pool of transactions. At the end of that minute, the New Relic agent selects the slowest transaction in that pool and performs a transaction trace on it. These are the general rules, but there are some agent-specific differences. For example: The Java agent collects occasional non-slow transactions. If one transaction is frequently traced, some agents will select other transactions to give a more diverse sampling. If you don't see traces in your account, it's possible that no transactions meet the necessary criteria. In this situation, you can adjust transaction trace settings to ensure some transactions will be traced. If you use Synthetic, you will likely have Synthetic monitor traces. Synthetic traces can happen more frequently than APM traces, potentially several per minute. Configure transaction traces To configure or edit trace settings, see the procedures for: Transaction traces Key transaction traces View transaction traces in UI To view transaction traces: Do one of the following: New Relic Explorer: Go to one.newrelic.com > Explorer > (select an app) > Monitor > Transactions. APM: Go to one.newrelic.com > APM > (select an app) > Monitor > Transactions. In the Transaction traces section, click transaction traces to view additional details.

Go to one.newrelic.com > APM > (select an app) > Monitor > Transactions > (select a transaction trace) > Database queries. Use Database queries Use the Database queries page to analyze and troubleshoot a slow transaction. For example: You notice on the APM Overview page that a transaction is abnormally slow. You select a transaction trace to get more details about that transaction. If the trace has associated database data, you select the Database queries page to examine the slow queries in the trace, and use them as the basis to troubleshoot and improve your app's performance. Other functions include: If you want to... Do this... View hidden queries By default, New Relic hides queries that take less than five milliseconds. To view these hidden queries, select the Show fast queries checkbox. View stack traces To view stack traces associated with a database query, click the database icon (in the table's Total duration column). Configure database query settings You can change database query settings in the same way you change other transaction trace settings; for example, via configuring the New Relic agent or, for some agents, via the UI. Common database query setting changes include: Collecting raw query data instead of obfuscated or turning off query collection Changing the stack trace threshold Turning on query explain plan collection Use database queries to improve performance Here are some tips to improve your app's database performance: Use database queries Comments Time Look for queries where the TOTAL DURATION contributes large amounts of time to the overall transaction time. This indicates a good place to try to enhance your database query with an index or some other optimization. Duplicate queries Look for queries that repeatedly query the same kind of information; for example, multiple queries to look up individual account IDs. Try rewriting the query to INCLUDE the specific values (account IDs 1, 2, 10, 14, 17, etc.) so that a single query can get all the relevant items. Database overhead Look at the structure of your queries to see if there are opportunities to combine different types of information into a single call; for example, querying for the account ID, name, etc. This is useful, for example, if your database center is in a different geographical location, because this will reduce overhead. The amount of time for your database request and response may be very fast. However, by combining requests into fewer calls, you can reduce that time even more. MySQL From your app's main APM Summary page, compare the database time on the main chart to other processing time. Sudden spikes or larger amounts of database time compared to other processing times may indicate problems. Find other slow queries The Trace details page is useful for examining a specific transaction's details. To see all of your application's slowest queries in one place, use the Slow queries feature.",

A transaction trace records the available function calls, database calls, and external calls. You can use transaction traces to troubleshoot performance issues and to get detailed low-level insight into how your app is working. What transactions record traces In APM, a transaction trace records the segments that make up a transaction. Because they give you more detail, you can use transaction traces to analyze and troubleshoot performance issues. Here are the default rules that govern which transactions a New Relic agent traces: Over the minute-long harvest cycle, all transactions that violate the threshold (either four times your Apdex T value or a specific number of seconds) are added to a pool of transactions. At the end of that minute, the New Relic agent selects the slowest transaction in that pool and performs a transaction trace on it. These are the general rules, but there are some agent-specific differences. For example: The Java agent collects occasional non-slow transactions. If one transaction is frequently traced, some agents will select other transactions to give a more diverse sampling. If you don't see traces in your account, it's possible that no transactions meet the necessary criteria. In this situation, you can adjust transaction trace settings to ensure some transactions will be traced. If you use Synthetic, you will likely have Synthetic monitor traces. Synthetic traces can happen more frequently than APM traces, potentially several per minute.

Yellow: More than 5% of the total transaction time was spent in this segment. Color-coded durations do not necessarily indicate a problem. Whether the timing is actually a problem depends on what you consider normal and acceptable for your application. Application code in traces If a segment is listed as Application code in the table, it indicates that that section of code was not instrumented. You can use custom instrumentation to get more detail on that part of the code. Segments will often be listed as Application code for partial traces. Partial traces For performance reasons, New Relic APM only captures the first 2,000 segments of a transaction trace (900 for Node.js). If a transaction trace exceeds that number of segments, the agent truncates the transaction trace and displays a message at the top of the Details page: This is a partial trace. The New Relic APM agents have differing rules for when to truncate segments. APM agent Truncate segment rules C SDK Truncates based on segment priority: The root segment has the highest priority. Segments that have seen distributed tracing activity have second-highest priority. Slow segments have third-highest priority. For more information, see the C SDK's documentation about newrelic_transaction_tracer_config_t on GitHub. Go The segment duration must be greater than the TransactionTracer.SegmentThreshold value set in your Go segment configuration. Java, .NET, Ruby These agents truncate traces chronologically. For more information, see the transaction tracer documentation for Java, .NET, or Ruby as applicable. Node.js The Node.js agent only captures the first 900 segments of a transaction trace. For more information, see Node.js transaction tracer configuration. PHP Truncates based on segment duration; the slowest 2,000 segments are captured for the trace. For more information, see PHP transaction tracer configuration. Python Truncates based on segment duration; the slowest 2,000 segments are captured for the trace. For more information, see Python transaction tracer configuration. Segment grouping rules Transaction traces that have a lot of segments can be hard to interpret. New Relic helps you by automatically grouping fast and/or repeated method calls into a single segment grouping. For example, you might see a segment titled 7 fast method calls. This means that, because of their fast completion, New Relic assumed these calls were unlikely to be a problem and grouped them together. You can expand that grouping to see the individual segments. Rules underlying segment grouping include: Fast calls: When New Relic detects four or more consecutive segments with a duration of 7.5 ms or less, these are grouped into a single collapsed header. Identical calls: When New Relic detects four or more consecutive identical calls, this usually indicates an N+1 problem. These segments are collapsed. Expanding the collapsed node displays only the first three calls, not all calls.",

      "body": "APM transaction traces collect detailed data about your application's transactions. Because they collect detailed data from your app, transaction traces can be a potential security concern. This document explains how to configure transaction traces for your data security needs. Database queries The database query types collected by transaction traces vary by New Relic language agent. Query collection is a potential security and/or privacy concern because queries can contain sensitive values. You can customize database query collection with three different security settings: Obfuscated: This is the default value. This setting strips string literals and numeric sequences from your queries and replaces them with the ? character. For example: the query select * from table where ssn='123-45-6789' would become select * from table where ssn=?. Off: Query collection is turned off entirely. Raw: If you are confident that full query data collection will not impact your data security or your users' privacy, you can change the setting to Raw, which will record all query values. You can edit database query collection with the Record SQL setting, explained in Configure transaction traces. HTTP request attributes and parameters The collection of HTTP request data can expose potentially sensitive data. New Relic calls the key/value data collected during an HTTP request attributes. By default, the collection of attributes is limited to only basic HTTP information that is not a source of sensitive data (for example, response code and host); these are part of the group of basic attributes that New Relic refers to as agent attributes. For data security reasons, the collection of other attributes, including user-specific parameters, is disabled by default. For information on how to enable/disable the collection of specific HTTP attributes and custom attributes, see Configure transaction traces. High security mode New Relic's default settings provide a high level of security. To force the most secure settings for all the applications in your account, you can use the high security mode. This mode ensures that, no matter how your admins and users configure your account, the most secure settings are forced and cannot be overridden. For more information, see High security mode.",

If a transaction trace exceeds that number of segments, the agent truncates the transaction trace and displays a message at the top of the Details page: This is a partial trace. The New Relic APM agents have differing rules for when to truncate segments. APM agent Truncate segment rules C SDK Truncates based on segment priority: The root segment has the highest priority. Segments that have seen distributed tracing activity have second-highest priority. Slow segments have third-highest priority. For more information, see the C SDK's documentation about newrelic_transaction_tracer_config_t on GitHub. Go The segment duration must be greater than the TransactionTracer.SegmentThreshold value set in your Go segment configuration. Java, .NET, Ruby These agents truncate traces chronologically. For more information, see the transaction tracer documentation for Java, .NET, or Ruby as applicable. Node.js The Node.js agent only captures the first 900 segments of a transaction trace. For more information, see Node.js transaction tracer configuration. PHP Truncates based on segment duration; the slowest 2,000 segments are captured for the trace. For more information, see PHP transaction tracer configuration. Python Truncates based on segment duration; the slowest 2,000 segments are captured for the trace. For more information, see Python transaction tracer configuration. Segment grouping rules Transaction traces that have a lot of segments can be hard to interpret. New Relic helps you by automatically grouping fast and/or repeated method calls into a single segment grouping. For example, you might see a segment titled 7 fast method calls. This means that, because of their fast completion, New Relic assumed these calls were unlikely to be a problem and grouped them together. You can expand that grouping to see the individual segments. Rules underlying segment grouping include: Fast calls: When New Relic detects four or more consecutive segments with a duration of 7.5 ms or less, these are grouped into a single collapsed header. Identical calls: When New Relic detects four or more consecutive identical calls, this usually indicates an N+1 problem. These segments are collapsed. Expanding the collapsed node displays only the first three calls, not all calls.",

A transaction trace records the available function calls, database calls, and external calls. You can use transaction traces to troubleshoot performance issues and to get detailed low-level insight into how your app is working. What transactions record traces In APM, a transaction trace records the segments that make up a transaction. Because they give you more detail, you can use transaction traces to analyze and troubleshoot performance issues. Here are the default rules that govern which transactions a New Relic agent traces: Over the minute-long harvest cycle, all transactions that violate the threshold (either four times your Apdex T value or a specific number of seconds) are added to a pool of transactions. At the end of that minute, the New Relic agent selects the slowest transaction in that pool and performs a transaction trace on it. These are the general rules, but there are some agent-specific differences. For example: The Java agent collects occasional non-slow transactions. If one transaction is frequently traced, some agents will select other transactions to give a more diverse sampling. If you don't see traces in your account, it's possible that no transactions meet the necessary criteria. In this situation, you can adjust transaction trace settings to ensure some transactions will be traced. If you use Synthetic, you will likely have Synthetic monitor traces.

Because they collect detailed data from your app, transaction traces can be a potential security concern. This document explains how to configure transaction traces for your data security needs. Database queries The database query types collected by transaction traces vary by New Relic language agent. Query collection is a potential security and/or privacy concern because queries can contain sensitive values. You can customize database query collection with three different security settings: Obfuscated: This is the default value. This setting strips string literals and numeric sequences from your queries and replaces them with the ? character. For example: the query select * from table where ssn='123-45-6789' would become select * from table where ssn=?. Off: Query collection is turned off entirely. Raw: If you are confident that full query data collection will not impact your data security or your users' privacy, you can change the setting to Raw, which will record all query values. You can edit database query collection with the Record SQL setting, explained in Configure transaction traces. HTTP request attributes and parameters The collection of HTTP request data can expose potentially sensitive data. New Relic calls the key/value data collected during an HTTP request attributes. By default, the collection of attributes is limited to only basic HTTP information that is not a source of sensitive data (for example, response code and host); these are part of the group of basic attributes that New Relic refers to as agent attributes. For data security reasons, the collection of other attributes, including user-specific parameters, is disabled by default. For information on how to enable/disable the collection of specific HTTP attributes and custom attributes, see Configure transaction traces. High security mode New Relic's default settings provide a high level of security. To force the most secure settings for all the applications in your account, you can use the high security mode. This mode ensures that, no matter how your admins and users configure your account, the most secure settings are forced and cannot be overridden. For more information, see High security mode.",

Trace details page functions Go to one.newrelic.com > APM > (select an app) > Monitor > Transactions > (select a transaction trace) > Trace details. The Trace details page displays a table with the timing data for the segments in a transaction, plus additional features and functions: Trace details page Description Primary trace data, functions The top of each transaction trace UI page shows several primary pieces of data, including the trace time, response time, and, if available, CPU info. Also, sometimes the UI may indicate a partial trace. Available functions include: Delete this trace: When you delete a trace, it cannot be retrieved. Track as key transaction. Duration column The duration of each segment and subsegment is shown as both the number of milliseconds and a percentage of the total transaction time. Especially slow segments are color-coded. Segment column The Segment column displays segment names and counts. Fast and repeat calls may be automatically grouped together. Sometimes you may see Application code as the name of a segment or subsegment. To expand segments, use either of the following: The Expand performance problems button at the top of the page The expand and collapse dropdown arrows next to the segments Drilldown column The Drilldown column may contain icons that link to additional transaction data, if available. Timestamp column The Timestamp column displays the start time of a segment or subsegment, relative to the start of the transaction. For example, a value of 3.150 s indicates that that segment started 3.15 seconds into the transaction. Drilldown options In the Drilldown column, icons indicate that additional data is available: Icon Description Database queries The database icon links to the raw database query for that query segment. Depending on your transaction trace settings, this query can either show as raw data or obfuscated data. If the total time for the segment exceeds the query plan threshold in your settings, the query analysis also will appear, along with a stack trace showing the exact location of the call in your code. Stack traces The magnifying glass links to stack trace details. Aggregate transaction details This icon indicates that cross application tracing details are not available. However, you can select this icon to view aggregated transaction information across multiple invocations of the transaction. Color coding of segment duration data The Duration column of the Trace details table is color-coded: Red: More than 25% of the total transaction time was spent in this segment. Yellow: More than 5% of the total transaction time was spent in this segment. Color-coded durations do not necessarily indicate a problem. Whether the timing is actually a problem depends on what you consider normal and acceptable for your application. Application code in traces If a segment is listed as Application code in the table, it indicates that that section of code was not instrumented. You can use custom instrumentation to get more detail on that part of the code. Segments will often be listed as Application code for partial traces. Partial traces For performance reasons, New Relic APM only captures the first 2,000 segments of a transaction trace (900 for Node.js). If a transaction trace exceeds that number of segments, the agent truncates the transaction trace and displays a message at the top of the Details page: This is a partial trace. The New Relic APM agents have differing rules for when to truncate segments. APM agent Truncate segment rules C SDK Truncates based on segment priority: The root segment has the highest priority. Segments that have seen distributed tracing activity have second-highest priority. Slow segments have third-highest priority. For more information, see the C SDK's documentation about newrelic_transaction_tracer_config_t on GitHub. Go The segment duration must be greater than the TransactionTracer.SegmentThreshold value set in your Go segment configuration. Java, .NET, Ruby These agents truncate traces chronologically. For more information, see the transaction tracer documentation for Java, .NET, or Ruby as applicable. Node.js The Node.js agent only captures the first 900 segments of a transaction trace. For more information, see Node.js transaction tracer configuration. PHP Truncates based on segment duration; the slowest 2,000 segments are captured for the trace. For more information, see PHP transaction tracer configuration. Python Truncates based on segment duration; the slowest 2,000 segments are captured for the trace. For more information, see Python transaction tracer configuration. Segment grouping rules Transaction traces that have a lot of segments can be hard to interpret. New Relic helps you by automatically grouping fast and/or repeated method calls into a single segment grouping. For example, you might see a segment titled 7 fast method calls. This means that, because of their fast completion, New Relic assumed these calls were unlikely to be a problem and grouped them together. You can expand that grouping to see the individual segments. Rules underlying segment grouping include: Fast calls: When New Relic detects four or more consecutive segments with a duration of 7.5 ms or less, these are grouped into a single collapsed header. Identical calls: When New Relic detects four or more consecutive identical calls, this usually indicates an N+1 problem. These segments are collapsed. Expanding the collapsed node displays only the first three calls, not all calls.",

Common database query setting changes include: Collecting raw query data instead of obfuscated or turning off query collection Changing the stack trace threshold Turning on query explain plan collection Use database queries to improve performance Here are some tips to improve your app's database performance: Use database queries Comments Time Look for queries where the TOTAL DURATION contributes large amounts of time to the overall transaction time. This indicates a good place to try to enhance your database query with an index or some other optimization. Duplicate queries Look for queries that repeatedly query the same kind of information; for example, multiple queries to look up individual account IDs. Try rewriting the query to INCLUDE the specific values (account IDs 1, 2, 10, 14, 17, etc.) so that a single query can get all the relevant items. Database overhead Look at the structure of your queries to see if there are opportunities to combine different types of information into a single call; for example, querying for the account ID, name, etc. This is useful, for example, if your database center is in a different geographical location, because this will reduce overhead. The amount of time for your database request and response may be very fast. However, by combining requests into fewer calls, you can reduce that time even more. MySQL From your app's main APM Summary page, compare the database time on the main chart to other processing time. Sudden spikes or larger amounts of database time compared to other processing times may indicate problems. Find other slow queries The Trace details page is useful for examining a specific transaction's details. To see all of your application's slowest queries in one place, use the Slow queries feature.",

      "body": "You can manage your alert notification channels using our GraphQL NerdGraph API. Here are some queries and mutations you can develop in our NerdGraph API explorer. Tip See the NerdGraph introduction for help getting started with NerdGraph API explorer. Get notification channels The notificationChannels query allows you to paginate through all of your notification channels per account. You can also use the notificationChannel query to get a specific notification channel by its ID. Tip Note that certain secret fields (for example passwords or API keys) are obfuscated in the returned fields. List all notification channels for an account This example returns every field for every notification channel on the supplied account ID, up to the page limit of 200. Note how we use inline fragments to refer to the specific fields on the concrete types implementing the AlertsNotificationChannel interface. { actor { account(id: YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID) { alerts { notificationChannels { channels { id name type ... on AlertsXMattersNotificationChannel { config { integrationUrl } } ... on AlertsWebhookNotificationChannel { config { baseUrl basicAuth { password username } customHttpHeaders { name value } customPayloadBody customPayloadType } } ... on AlertsVictorOpsNotificationChannel { config { key routeKey } } ... on AlertsUserNotificationChannel { config { userId } } ... on AlertsSlackNotificationChannel { config { teamChannel url } } ... on AlertsPagerDutyNotificationChannel { config { apiKey } } ... on AlertsOpsGenieNotificationChannel { config { apiKey dataCenterRegion recipients tags teams } } ... on AlertsHipChatNotificationChannel { config { authToken baseUrl roomId } } ... on AlertsEmailNotificationChannel { config { emails includeJson } } ... on AlertsCampfireNotificationChannel { config { room subdomain token } } } totalCount nextCursor } } } } } Copy Paginate through notification channels with cursor pagination If a given account's list of notification channels exceeds the 200 channel page limit, you can use the pagination cursor to retrieve additional pages. With cursor pagination, you continue to request additional pages using the nextCursor until that field returns empty in the response. An empty nextCursor signals that you have reached the end of the result set. Here's an example: { actor { account(id: YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID) { alerts { notificationChannels { channels { id name type } totalCount nextCursor } } } } } Copy The code above returns a set of results like this: { \"data\": { \"actor\": { \"account\": { \"alerts\": { \"notificationChannels\": { \"channels\": [ { \"id\": \"250\", \"name\": \"Channel 1\", \"type\": \"SLACK\" }, { \"id\": \"713\", \"name\": \"Channel 2\", \"type\": \"WEBHOOK\" }, // ... +198 more notification channels in reality ], \"nextCursor\": \"Wh4LK9JYzfACVlNkyvf7Rg==:I5VbSEpgx3UWNA5AOVsUPv4=\", \"totalCount\": 268 } } } } } } Copy In your next request, provide the cursor like so, updating each subsequent request to return the updated cursor, until the cursor is empty: { actor { account(id: YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID) { alerts { notificationChannels(cursor: \"Wh4LK9JYzfACVlNkyvf7Rg==:I5VbSEpgx3UWNA5AOVsUPv4=\") { channels { id name type } totalCount nextCursor } } } } } Copy Find a specific notification channel by id If you have a specific notification channel's ID, the API allows you to look it up directly. Note that because the specific channel is a concrete type implementing the AlertsNotificationChannel interface, you may need to specify certain fields using the ... on syntax for inline fragments. In this example, we are retrieving a Slack channel: { actor { account(id: YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID) { alerts { notificationChannel(id: YOUR_CHANNEL_ID) { id name type ... on AlertsSlackNotificationChannel { config { teamChannel url } } } } } } } Copy Create a notification channel In order to create an alert notification channel, you need to know the specific type of notification channel you want to create (for example email, Slack, etc.), as well as the details necessary to configure it (which will depend on the channel type). Once a notification channel has been created, it can be associated with one or more alert policies. Once associated, those channels will receive notifications from those policies when conditions are violated. Caution While you can query for any existing notification channel type, you can only create a subset of them. Specifically, the user channel type has no editable fields, and the Campfire and HipChat channel types are both deprecated. Create an email notification channel An example create mutation for an email notification channel: mutation { alertsNotificationChannelCreate(accountId: YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID, notificationChannel: { email: { emails: [\"email@test.com\"], includeJson: true, name: \"Some Name <email@test.com>\" } }) { notificationChannel { ... on AlertsEmailNotificationChannel { id name type config { emails includeJson }

tags recipients dataCenterRegion } } } error { description errorType } } } Copy Create a PagerDuty notification channel An example create mutation for a PagerDuty notification channel: mutation {

alertsNotificationChannelCreate(accountId: YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID, notificationChannel: { xMatters: { integrationUrl: \"https://company.instance.xmatters.com/api/xm/v<version>/...\", name: \"xMatters notification channel name\" } }) { notificationChannel { ... on AlertsXMattersNotificationChannel { id name type config { integrationUrl } } } error { description errorType } } } Copy Update a notification channel In order to update an alert notification channel, you need to know the specific type of notification channel you want to change (for example email, Slack, etc.), as well as the details necessary to configure it (which will depend on the channel type). Consistent with other GraphQL APIs, you can update a single field on the channel without knowing anything other than the channel's ID. Caution While you can query for any existing notification channel type, you can only update a subset of them. Specifically, the user channel type has no editable fields, and the Campfire and HipChat channel types are both deprecated. Update an email notification channel An example update mutation for an email notification channel where we're updating only the name: mutation { alertsNotificationChannelUpdate(accountId: YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID, id: YOUR_CHANNEL_ID, notificationChannel: { email: { name: \"Updated Name <email@test.com>\" } }) { notificationChannel { ... on AlertsEmailNotificationChannel { id name type } } error { description errorType notificationChannelId } } } Copy Update an OpsGenie notification channel An example update mutation for an OpsGenie notification channel where we're updating only the name: mutation { alertsNotificationChannelUpdate(accountId: YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID, id: YOUR_CHANNEL_ID, notificationChannel: { opsGenie: { name: \"OpsGenie updated channel name\" } }) { notificationChannel { ... on AlertsOpsGenieNotificationChannel { id name type } } error { description errorType notificationChannelId } } } Copy Update a PagerDuty notification channel An example update mutation for a PagerDuty notification channel where we're updating only the name: mutation { alertsNotificationChannelUpdate(accountId: YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID, id: YOUR_CHANNEL_ID, notificationChannel: { pagerDuty: { name: \"PagerDuty updated channel name\" } }) { notificationChannel { ... on AlertsPagerDutyNotificationChannel { id name type } } error { description errorType notificationChannelId } } } Copy Update a Slack notification channel An example update mutation for a Slack notification channel where we're updating only the name: mutation { alertsNotificationChannelUpdate(accountId: YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID, id: YOUR_CHANNEL_ID, notificationChannel: { slack: { name: \"Slack updated channel name\" } }) { notificationChannel { ... on AlertsSlackNotificationChannel { id name type } } error { description errorType notificationChannelId } } } Copy Update a VictorOps notification channel An example update mutation for a VictorOps notification channel where we're updating only the name: mutation { alertsNotificationChannelUpdate(accountId: YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID, id: YOUR_CHANNEL_ID, id: YOUR_CHANNEL_ID, notificationChannel: { victorOps: { name: \"VictorOps updated channel name\" } }) { notificationChannel { ... on AlertsVictorOpsNotificationChannel { id name type } } error { description errorType notificationChannelId } } } Copy Update a Webhook notification channel An example update mutation for a Webhook notification channel where we're updating only the name: mutation { alertsNotificationChannelUpdate(accountId: YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID, id: YOUR_CHANNEL_ID, notificationChannel: { webhook: { name: \"Webhook updated channel name\" } }) { notificationChannel { ... on AlertsWebhookNotificationChannel { id name type } } error { description errorType notificationChannelId } } } Copy Update an xMatters notification channel An example update mutation for an xMatters notification channel where we're updating only the name: mutation { alertsNotificationChannelUpdate(accountId: YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID, id: YOUR_CHANNEL_ID, notificationChannel: { xMatters: { name: \"xMatters updated channel name\" } }) { notificationChannel { ... on AlertsXMattersNotificationChannel { id name type } } error { description errorType notificationChannelId } } } Copy Delete a notification channel You can delete a notification channel with only the account ID and the channel ID. Note that deleting a channel dissociates it from all policies, meaning that no further notifications will be sent to that channel. mutation { alertsNotificationChannelDelete(accountId: YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID, id: YOUR_CHANNEL_ID) { id error { description errorType notificationChannelId } } } Copy Associate channels to a policy Creating an alert notification channel is not enough: Once the channel has been created, it needs to be associated to one or more policies. Once associated to a policy, the channel can recieve alert notifications when conditions on that policy go into violation. In this example, we associate two channels with a policy: mutation { alertsNotificationChannelsAddToPolicy(accountId: YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID, notificationChannelIds: [FIRST_CHANNEL_ID, SECOND_CHANNEL_ID], policyId: YOUR_POLICY_ID ) { notificationChannels { id } policyId errors { description errorType notificationChannelId } } } Copy Dissociate a channel from a policy In those instances where a notification channel has outlived its usefulness (for example, an email list that has been retired), the time has come to dissociate that channel from the policy (or policies) that are sending alert notifications to it. This API call leaves the channel itself intact, but removes it from the specified policy. In this example, we are removing two channels from a policy (leaving any others in place), and getting back confirmation that those two channel IDs have been removed: mutation { alertsNotificationChannelsRemoveFromPolicy(accountId: YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID, notificationChannelIds: [FIRST_CHANNEL_ID, SECOND_CHANNEL_ID], policyId: YOUR_POLICY_ID ) { notificationChannels { id } policyId errors { description errorType notificationChannelId } } } Copy Tip Removing an alert notification channel from a policy does not delete the policy because it might be used by other policies. On the other hand, deleting a channel will cause all associated channels to stop sending alert notifications to that channel.",

      "body": "Our Oracle Database integration collects key performance metrics on databases, tablespaces, and memory by default. You can customize your configuration to collect even more metrics, giving you detailed characterization of database performance. Read on to install the integration, and to see what data we collect. Compatibility and requirements Our integration is compatible with Oracle Database versions 11.2 and higher. Before installing the integration, make sure that you meet the following requirements: Linux distro compatible with infrastructure, except for RHEL/CentOS/OEL versions lower than 7. Install the infrastructure agent. Oracle Instant Client on the agent box. Oracle database with ORACLE_HOME configured to the correct directory for the root user. Oracle database user with both CONNECT and SELECT privileges on the required global views. Oracle database with a listener.ora file configured to monitor from a remote connection. By default, Oracle Database only listens to localhost. Oracle Database users and privileges In the Oracle database, execute the following statements to create a new user and assign user privileges. USERNAME and similar user-specific values must be replaced. If you use Oracle DB 12c or higher, use ALTER SESSION to access the database and manage users and user properties. Do not run this query if your Oracle DB version is lower than 12c. ALTER SESSION set \"_Oracle_SCRIPT\"=true; Copy Use CREATE USER to add a new user to the database. Replace USER_PASSWORD with the new user's password. CREATE USER USERNAME IDENTIFIED BY \"USER_PASSWORD\"; Copy Tip For assistance with user maintenance questions, consult the Oracle documentation or contact your system or database administrator. Grant CONNECT privileges to the user. GRANT CONNECT TO USERNAME; Copy Grant SELECT privileges to the user on the following global views: cdb_data_files cdb_pdbs cdb_users gv_$sysmetric gv_$pgastat gv_$instance gv_$filestat gv_$parameter sys.dba_data_files gv_$session gv_$sesstat gv_$statname gv_$rowcache gv_$sga gv_$sysstat v_$database gv_$librarycache gv_$sqlarea gv_$system_event dba_tablespaces gv_$session_wait gv_$rollstat v_$instance You can execute the following SQL statements together in one script or individually. GRANT SELECT ON cdb_data_files TO USERNAME; GRANT SELECT ON cdb_pdbs TO USERNAME; GRANT SELECT ON cdb_users TO USERNAME; GRANT SELECT ON gv_$sysmetric TO USERNAME; GRANT SELECT ON gv_$pgastat TO USERNAME; GRANT SELECT ON gv_$instance TO USERNAME; GRANT SELECT ON gv_$filestat TO USERNAME; GRANT SELECT ON gv_$parameter TO USERNAME; GRANT SELECT ON sys.dba_data_files TO USERNAME; GRANT SELECT ON DBA_TABLESPACES TO USERNAME; GRANT SELECT ON DBA_TABLESPACE_USAGE_METRICS TO USERNAME; GRANT SELECT ON gv_$session TO USERNAME; GRANT SELECT ON gv_$sesstat TO USERNAME; GRANT SELECT ON gv_$statname TO USERNAME; GRANT SELECT ON gv_$rowcache TO USERNAME; GRANT SELECT ON gv_$sga TO USERNAME; GRANT SELECT ON gv_$sysstat TO USERNAME; GRANT SELECT ON v_$database TO USERNAME; GRANT SELECT ON gv_$librarycache TO USERNAME; GRANT SELECT ON gv_$sqlarea TO USERNAME; GRANT SELECT ON gv_$system_event TO USERNAME; GRANT SELECT ON dba_tablespaces TO USERNAME; GRANT SELECT ON gv_$session_wait TO USERNAME; GRANT SELECT ON gv_$rollstat TO USERNAME; GRANT SELECT ON v_$instance TO USERNAME; Copy Install and activate To install the Oracle Database integration: Follow the instructions for installing an integration, using the file name nri-oracledb. Change directory to the integrations folder: cd /etc/newrelic-infra/integrations.d Copy Copy the sample configuration file: sudo cp oracledb-config.yml.sample oracledb-config.yml Copy Edit the oracledb-config.yml file as described in the configuration settings. Restart the infrastructure agent. Additional notes: Advanced: It's also possible to install the integration from a tarball file. This gives you full control over the installation and configuration process. On-host integrations do not automatically update. For best results, regularly update the integration package and the infrastructure agent. Configure the integration An integration's YAML-format configuration is where you can place required login credentials and configure how data is collected. Which options you change depend on your setup and preference. For an example configuration, see the example config file. Important With secrets management, you can configure on-host integrations with New Relic infrastructure's agent to use sensitive data (such as passwords) without having to write them as plain text into the integration's configuration file. For more information, see Secrets management. Commands The oracledb-config.yml file accepts the following commands: all_data: collects both inventory and metric data. Arguments The all_data command accepts the following arguments: service_name: Oracle Database service name of the instance (or cluster of instances) to monitor. This field is required. username: username of a user created with the required permissions. This field is required. password: password of a user created with the required permissions. This field is required. is_sys_dba: boolean value that indicates whether the authenticating user has SysDBA permissions. Default: false. oracle_home: path to where ORACLE_HOME is. This field is required. is_sys_oper: boolean value that indicates whether the authenticating user has SysOper permissions. Default: false. tablespaces: A JSON array of tablespaces to collect. If omitted, collects all tablespaces. Default: none (all tablespaces). Due to performance reasons, the integration will refuse to collect tablespace data for more than 200 tablespaces. If your database has more than 200 of tablespaces, you must restrict collection to a smaller number by using the tablespaces parameter. hostname: hostname of the instance to monitor. Default: 127.0.0.1. port: port number on which Oracle Database is running. Default: 1521. connection_string: a full connection string such as those found in tnsnames.ora. If this is specified, it takes priority over host, port, and service_name. extended_metrics: boolean value that indicates whether to collect extended metrics. Default: false. custom_metrics_query: a custom SQL query to run against the configured instance. Each row of the query is added as a new metric set on OracleCustomSample. Each non-null column in the row is added as an attribute on that metric set. custom_metrics_config: a path to a YAML file that contains a list of queries, along with custom sample names and metric type overrides. See example below for details. Labels The labels field controls the environment attribute. Default: production. Example configuration Example oracledb-config.yml file configuration: Example configuration integration_name: com.newrelic.oracledb instances: - name: oracledb command: all_data arguments: username: oracle_user password: oracle_password hostname: oracle-host.localnet oracle_home: <path to ORACLE_HOME> is_sys_dba: true service_name: ORCL custom_metrics_config: <path to custom queries yaml> # custom_metrics_query: >- # SELECT # 'physical_reads' AS \"metric_name\", # 'gauge' AS \"metric_type\", # SUM(PHYRDS) AS \"metric_value\", # INST_ID AS \"instanceID\" # FROM gv$filestat # GROUP BY INST_ID; labels: env: staging Copy Example custom query configuration --- queries: # Metric names are set to the column names in the query results - query: >- SELECT SUM(stat.gets) AS \"gets\", SUM(stat.waits) AS \"waits\", SUM(stat.waits)/SUM(stat.gets) AS \"ratio\", inst.inst_id FROM GV$ROLLSTAT stat, GV$INSTANCE inst WHERE stat.inst_id=inst.inst_id GROUP BY inst.inst_id # If not set explicitly here, metric type will default to # 'gauge' for numbers and 'attribute' for strings metric_types: gets: gauge # If unset, sample_name defaults to OracleCustomSample sample_name: MyCustomSample Copy For more about the general structure of on-host integration configuration, see Configuration.

Troubleshooting Troubleshooting tips: The Oracle library cannot be loaded If monitoring remotely, install the Oracle Instant Client and follow the instructions on how to add libclntsh.so to the shared library search path. If monitoring from the box with Oracle Database installed, install the Oracle Instant Client and add the path ORACLE_HOME/lib to the ldconfig search path. ORACLE_HOME is not set correctly This error will appear in the logs as [ERR] ORA-01284: Error while trying to retrieve text for error. To avoid this error make sure ORACLE_HOME is set correctly for the agent process. The agent runs as root, so its environment is not the same as the oracle user. To verify this setting, execute cat /proc/$(pgrep newrelic-infra)/environ to print out the environment variables for the infrastructure process, the output should include ORACLE_HOME if configured correctly. I get an ORA error To resolve errors of the type ORA, refer to Oracle's error list. Check the source code This integration is open source software. That means you can browse its source code and send improvements, or create your own fork and build it.",

      "body": "The interactive newrelic-install script simplifies installing PHP applications in New Relic. It works with multiple PHP installations as well as installations in non-standard locations. Running it will: Copy the correct PHP modules into place. Install sample ini files. Configure the New Relic proxy daemon. Important Be sure to review the information about working with multiple installations and non-standard locations before running the script. Find the installer script The installer script location depends on how you installed the New Relic PHP agent. Via system package manager: The installation script is in the /usr/bin directory. Via a tarball: The installation script is in the directory where you extracted the tar archive file. The script in the tar distribution includes installation steps otherwise handled by the package manager. Tip To use PHP or any other agent, as well as the rest of our observability platform, join the New Relic family! Sign up to create your free account in only a few seconds. Then ingest up to 100GB of data for free each month. Forever. Work with multiple PHP installations For newrelic-install to correctly detect multiple installations, ensure your PATH environment variable is correctly set. The newrelic-install script can only install the agent for versions it can find. If you want to... Do this... Specify additional directories Use the NR_INSTALL_PATH environment variable with a colon-separated list. Override NR_INSTALL_PATH and PATH Specify a set of directories in the NR_INSTALL_PHPLIST environment variable as a colon-separated list. These directories must contain either the command line version of PHP or the php-config script. Invoke the installer script The script has two modes: install and uninstall. If you invoke it with no arguments, you will be prompted to select a mode. From the command line, run the script at its location: Via system package manager: /usr/bin/newrelic-install Via a tar archive directory: ./newrelic-install Use the install mode Follow this process to install New Relic. 1. Invoke install mode. Invoke install mode by using one of these methods: Run newrelic-install with the install command line option. Run newrelic-install with no options and select the install option from the main menu when invoking the script. 2. Provide your New Relic license key. At the prompt, enter your New Relic license key. This key will be inserted into any INI files created during the rest of the installation process. 3. Select which PHP version to use if applicable. If newrelic-install finds more than one version of PHP, select which version of PHP to use. You will not see this screen if the script only finds a single version of PHP. Example: The menu shows seven options: 1) /usr/bin 2) /usr/local/php/5.2.16/bin 3) /usr/local/php/5.2.16-zts/bin 4) /usr/local/php/5.3.4/bin 5) /usr/local/php/5.3.4-zts/bin 6) /usr/local/php/5.4.19-zts/bin 7) /usr/local/php/5.5.4-zts/bin 0) Exit Select (1-7, 0 to exit, or all): Copy ZTS options apply only to PHP agent versions 9.17 and earlier. ZTS is not available for PHP versions 9.18 or higher. At the menu, use any of these options: To select only one version, enter the number indicating the version you want to use. To select multiple versions, enter a comma- or space-separated list of numbers. To select every version listed, enter the keyword all. To exit the installation process, Enter 0. For each directory selected, the script will attempt to install the agent in the proper place and report on each attempt. Important For PHP installations that allow multiple .ini files, the install script will copy a template file into place, if a modified one is not already installed. Make a note of the .ini files you will need to modify manually. As of PHP agent version 4.0, the installer will not work properly if it detects a single version of PHP 5.1, which is deprecated (2013). If you must run PHP 5.1, use PHP agent version 3.9.5.13. If you need help, get support at support.newrelic.com. 4. Install the daemon if applicable. If the daemon was not installed by the package manager, install the daemon. If this is an update or reinstall, the script provide a confirmation prompt before overwriting the old copy of the daemon. If installation is successful, the script will show this final message: New Relic is now installed on your system. Congratulations! Copy 5. Restart your web server. To activate the PHP agent, restart your web server. If you are running PHP-FPM, you may also need to restart PHP-FPM separately before the agent will be active. 6. Note your archive file. Note the name and location of the install archive file. This file will be located at /tmp/nrinstall-<var>nnnn</var>.tar and will contain both the install log and useful system information to help New Relic Technical Support with troubleshooting. 7. Fine-tune your configuration. After you install New Relic successfully and restart your web server, you can begin gathering data about your applications. After a few minutes, data will begin to appear on your APM Summary page. To fine-tune operation of both the PHP agent and daemon, review the PHP configuration options. Use the install_daemon mode To install the daemon without the agent, use PHP agent 9.2 or higher. Run newrelic-install with the install_daemon command line option. This is useful if the daemon runs on a different host or in a different container than the PHP application. For example, this may happen with agent install on containers. Troubleshoot your PHP installation If there were problems with the installation process, or if no data appears in the UI, review the PHP troubleshooting procedures before contacting New Relic for support. Be sure to attach your archive file to any bug report, as well as the output of the phpinfo() function produced by your web server. Uninstall mode You can uninstall New Relic but keep valuable config files (useful when upgrading), or permanently uninstall New Relic from your system. Uninstall and keep config files. This method is useful when you want to uninstall and upgrade. The uninstall does not remove important configuration files, such as your daemon configuration file. Also, it does not remove any newrelic.ini files that you have modified. To uninstall New Relic using the install script, use either of these options: Invoke newrelic-install with the uninstall option. Run newrelic-install with no options, and select the uninstall option from the main menu when invoking the script. Permanently uninstall New Relic. To permanently uninstall New Relic from your system: Invoke newrelic-install with the purge option. This will remove all the configuration files and any links created at installation time. This will not affect any configuration parameters placed in files such as php.in. Also, this will not remove the software packages installed on the system. To remove the New Relic software packages installed with a package manager, see Uninstalling RedHat and CentOS or Uninstalling Ubuntu and Debian.

      "body": "If you use Browser to monitor end-user browser activity, you can now see end-user-originating browser-side traces in distributed tracing. This document contains: Benefits of this feature Requirements Enable distributed tracing Enable cross-origin resource sharing (CORS) Find and query data Troubleshooting Tip Browser data is available in standard distributed tracing only, not Infinite Tracing. Benefits of browser data in distributed tracing By enabling New Relic to report browser data to distributed tracing, you can see the connection between front-end activity and back-end activity. You can see across a full transaction, from time spent by an end user in the web browser, to network activity, to associated back-end services. Benefits of this feature: Quickly spot latencies, errors, and anomalies in the browser or network Resolve customer-facing problems more quickly All the benefits of distributed tracing applied to your end-user monitoring Requirements and compatibility This feature reports AJAX requests (Fetch and XHR) that occur during a browser interaction. By default, only single-origin requests are monitored unless cross-origin resource sharing is enabled. Make sure you have the minimum versions for your Browser, APM, and APM agents: Browser Pro + SPA, with distributed tracing enabled Browser agent version 1153 or higher Browser agent version 1158 or higher (required for cross-origin resource sharing) Browser agent version 1173 or higher (required for w3c trace context support) APM agent version: C SDK 1.3 or higher Java 5.9.0 or higher PHP 9.4.0 or higher Other APM agent version requirements Enable distributed tracing To enable distributed tracing for Browser monitoring: Make sure you meet requirements, including having: Full-Stack Observability Browser Pro with SPA enabled Go to one.newrelic.com, and click Browser > (select an app) > Settings > Application settings. Turn on the Distributed tracing toggle. By default, for agent version 1173 and above, the newrelic, traceparent, and tracestate headers will be added to all same-origin AJAX requests. Optional: If all of your services are configured to use the w3c trace context headers, you can choose to exclude the newrelic, traceparent, and tracestate headers from requests. Optional: Enable cross-origin resource sharing. Redeploy the Browser agent (either restarting the associated APM agent or updating the copy/paste Browser installation). Enable cross-origin resource sharing (CORS) If you have AJAX requests that need resources from different origins, you can enable cross-origin resource sharing (CORS). By default, distributed tracing for cross-origin requests is not enabled because of browser CORS security restrictions: Distributed tracing is implemented by adding a custom HTTP headers (newrelic, traceparent, and tracestate) to outgoing AJAX requests, and browsers typically do not allow custom headers on cross-origin requests. With the release of agent version 1173, we now support the w3c trace context headers (traceparent and tracestate) so these should also be allowed in your configuration. There are two separate configurations required to enable cross-origin distributed tracing: Configure the service on the different origin to accept the newrelic custom header Configure Browser monitoring to include the target origin in distributed tracing Our step-by-step instructions provide key concepts and steps to enable this feature, but if you need more background about how cross-origin resource sharing works, we recommend this Mozilla developer document. Risks and mitigations Caution Cross-origin resource sharing can expose you to a high level of risk if the services on the different origins are not configured correctly. The AJAX requests will likely return an error, resulting in a variety of failures, including: Resources failing to load (for example, images and key content) Login failures Entire site outages (depending on type of requests enabled) By enabling this cross-origin resource sharing feature, you are acknowledging the following: You understand that this feature is optional and not mandatory. You understand the steps you need to take in order to enable this feature for your services and your domains. You understand that if you do not properly configure your services prior to deployment (including but not limited to configuring your services on your domains to accept custom headers) portions or all of your website will likely malfunction. You understand that New Relic is neither responsible nor liable for errors or issues related to your misconfiguration of servers or services. You fully and solely accept the risks and wish to proceed. The best way to minimize your risk is to ensure you fully understand the process and to try it first in a test environment. Before reading the step-by-step instructions, it may help to first read this overview of the process: To use distributed tracing with cross-origin resources, you populate a list of approved cross-origin resources in New Relic, and then we automatically send the following custom headers to those resources: newrelic, traceparent, and tracestate. For this process to work, you must first ensure that someone has configured the services on the other origins to accept this custom header. Cross-origin resource sharing uses a variety of HTTP headers (both in the request and response). The header that specifically applies to New Relic is the Access-Control-Allow-Headers response header, which can include newrelic, traceparent, tracestate, or newrelic, traceparent, tracestate in its value depending on what tracing strategies you enabled in your APM-monitored application. You must configure your server to return this CORS header in its response. Example: Access-Control-Allow-Headers: newrelic, traceparent, tracestate Important New Relic cannot perform any validation to ensure the services on the other origins were configured correctly. If you're unsure about how to allow these headers, do not add cross-origin resources to the approved list in the New Relic UI. Enable cross-origin resource sharing Caution You should always try enabling CORS in a test environment before setting it up in production. To enable cross-origin resource sharing: Confirm that the services on the other origins are configured to accept the newrelic header using: Access-Control-Allow-Headers: newrelic, traceparent, tracestate (for details, see Risks and mitigations). Confirm that you meet the Browser monitoring requirements. Make sure you are in one.newrelic.com, and click Browser > (select an app) > Application settings. Turn on the Distributed tracing toggle if it's not already enabled. Turn on the Cross-origin resource sharing (CORS) toggle. Under Cross-origin resource sharing (CORS), add cross-origin resources to the approved list. Important Valid cross-origin resources must include: The prefix http:// or https:// The domain name The port number is not required unless it differs from the default for HTTP (port 80) or HTTPS (port 443). Select Save application settings to update the agent configuration. Redeploy the Browser agent (either restarting the associated APM agent or updating the copy/paste Browser installation). Find data Tips for finding and querying data: You can find end-user-originating traces in any New Relic One distributed tracing UI. In the distributed tracing UI, end-user spans are indicated with the icon. To see a span's attributes, select a span in the UI. Spans are reported as Span data, and can be queried in New Relic. Query tips: Query by browser app name by setting browserApp.name to the browser app name. Query for traces containing at least one browser app span with browserApp.name is not null. Query for traces containing at least one back-end app with appName is not null. Query for traces containing both browser and back-end spans by combining the two previous conditions. Troubleshooting If you don't see end-user spans, or are having other distributed tracing issues, see Troubleshooting.",

      "body": "New Relic Browser's Filterable Geography page provides a world view with color-coded performance information about cities, regions, and countries anywhere around the world. You can filter and drill down into detailed information, or use your mouse to select or zoom in and out of any location on the map. The enhanced attributes provide deep visibility not only about your end users' experience with page load timing, but also with network performance anywhere around the world. This level of visual detail is especially useful for professionals in IT and Operations to make business decisions about peering agreements and CDN usage. Contents Requirements Your New Relic Browser subscription level and your time picker settings determine what data you can view: Pro or higher: As of January 2016, the Filterable Geography feature automatically appears in your New Relic Browser user interface. No special setup is required. You can view up to eight days of data. Your application must be enabled to send PageView data to New Relic Insights in order to use Filterable Geography. Lite: The Filterable Geography feature appears in your New Relic Browser's UI menu but currently is not available for use. Any subscription level: If you need to use New Relic Browser's legacy Geography feature, you can still view it from your selected browser app. Factors affecting collected data To capture page load timing information, New Relic Browser uses the Navigation Timing API, which most (but not all) browsers support. If the browsers do not support the Navigation Timing API, then New Relic Browser charts and data points can only show the network data they receive for DNS lookup, connection, secure handshake, etc. This may not be 100% of the app's overall traffic. Also, firewalls may have an impact on the geographical data collected about your end users. View performance data by location one.newrelic.com > Browser > (select an app) > Browser app > Filterable Geography: Here is an example of the map before drilling down into detailed information about London, England. To view or sort the performance information by location: Go to one.newrelic.com > Browser > (select an app) > Filterable Geography. Select the type of performance data to view from the dropdown, or use the default Average page load time. To drill down to a specific area, mouse over or select any area on the geographical map, or select any of the ten worst performing locations from the list to the right of the map. To view specific performance metrics, select any of the attributes below the funnel icon. To view comparison data, select the Page load performance or Historical performance chart below the selected location's geographical map. Use map functions Use any of New Relic's standard user interface functions and page functions to drill down into detailed information. Here is a summary of additional options with the Filterable Geography page. If you want to... Do this... Change what kind of performance data appears Select your choice from the dropdown. Default performance indicator is Average page load time. The map's legend lists the ten best or worst performing areas (depending on the selected performance indicator) for the selected time period. For example: If you select Count, the map's legend shows the top ten locations with the highest number of page loads, as well as the average page load time for each. If you select Connection setup, New Relic Browser first filters out areas with low throughput. Then the map's legend shows the top ten locations where average connection time is the slowest, as well as the average page load time and count for each. View summary performance information about a specific location Mouse over any colored area on the map, select a location from the list, or zoom in and out of any area on the map. View detailed data for a location Select any area of the map. For example: If you select Canada, the map and legend show color-coded performance data for each province and territory. The list to the right of the map shows the top ten worst performing areas. If you select a specific province or territory, the map shows color-coded performance data for the top ten cities. The map includes circled locations which you can mouse over or select to view detailed information. In addition, the Page load performance and Historical performance charts below the map automatically update with each location you select. Hide the list of available attributes Select the funnel icon. Return to a larger world view Select another location on the map, or clear the filter labels above the map. Tip To return to the original map view of the world, select any area on an ocean. Examine heat map details one.newrelic.com > Browser > (select an app) > Browser app > Filterable Geography: Here is an example of the map as you use filter and zoom tools to drill down into detailed information about London, England. Athough overall throughput for the area is good (green), the nearby yellow areas, and the smaller red and orange circles indicate nearby cities with varying levels of throughput problems, not the size of those cities. The Filterable Geography heat map identifies performance quality with color and with the size of circles. Heat map Description Color scale Performance quality ranges from green (the best) to yellow, orange, and then red (the worst). When selecting indicators of usage rather than performance, the heat map shows shades of purple, with the darkest shades indicating the highest usage. The color scale adapts to your app's specific performance. Each area is a percentile range. To view the range for each color segment, mouse over the heat map's legend. Thresholds Different thresholds are dynamically applied to the colors based on the type of performance indicator you select from the dropdown and the maximum value your app has reported. For example, green for Average page load time may indicate 0 to 3.3 seconds, while green for Average network time may indicate 0 to 256 milliseconds. Circles The map's colored circles help you identify areas with performance problems at a glance. Each circle's radius is based on throughput reported for the city it represents, not the size of the city itself. You may see many circles overlapping each other. This usually indicates a grouping of metropolitan areas which represent a geographic area of heavy traffic. Filter performance metrics The Filter feature allows you to select and group data by attributes in various categories, including: Page view Geography Browser Identity Custom The filtered results appear on the geographical map, where you can use any of the standard map functions to explore additional details. Here are some examples. Unsatisfactory network performance by ASN In this example, your organization is preparing to renew a peering agreement with the owner of an autonomous system, called \"My-ASN.\" You are concerned that continued outages and other connection issues are affecting customer satisfaction with your site, and you want to compare its performance with other ASNs. You have a New Relic Browser Pro account. Go to one.newrelic.com > Browser > (select an app) > Filterable Geography. From the performance type dropdown, select Connection setup. Select the funnel icon. To view the specific ASN's performance: From the search window, type My-ASN, and then select this name from the Filter by results. OR To compare performance with other ASNs: From Geography attributes > ASN organizations, review the performance data for each organization on the list, and then select Back to groupings list. To close the filter list, select the funnel icon. Follow standard procedures to use the map functions and view comparative performance details. To clear the filter, select the attribute name. Page rendering performance during sales promotion In this example, your organization has a special three-day sales promotion for an upcoming holiday. Your holiday-merchandise page has undergone major changes, including dozens of new images. You want to look for performance problems with page rendering on Android mobile devices during this sales period. You have a New Relic Browser Pro account. Go to one.newrelic.com > Browser > (select an app) > Filterable Geography. Use the time picker to change the date range to the promotion period. From the performance type dropdown, select Page rendering. Select the funnel icon. From Page view attributes > Page Url, select your site's holiday-merchandise page, and then select Back to groupings list. From Browser attributes > User agent OS, select Android, and then select Back to groupings list. To close the filter list, select the funnel icon. Follow standard procedures to use the map functions and view comparative performance details. To clear the filters, select their attribute names. View comparative performance details Charts on the Page load performance and Historical performance tabs automatically refresh with comparative performance details for the selected location. one.newrelic.com > Browser > (select an app) > Browser app > Filterable Geography: Charts on the Page load performance and Historical performance tabs automatically refresh with details for the selected location. The Page load performance tab shows two charts. The Average page load time chart includes: Average page load time for each segment of the page load timing process in seconds Request queuing information (the time after a request enters your production systems and before it reaches your application) if applicable The Average network time chart shows key elements, including how long it takes for DNS lookup, connection establishment, and secure handshake, in seconds. Tip Sometimes areas on the charts may appear to be zero or near zero. This is because some apps use existing TCP connections, and they do not need to establish new connections. The Historical performance tab shows comparison data for the selected time period, yesterday, and last week for the selected location. This includes: Average response time Throughput in pages per minute (ppm) Available metrics You can filter and group geographical performance data in New Relic Browser and in New Relic Insights. Available metrics include: Performance Metrics Webpage Page load time Throughput (pages per minute or ppm) Network time Connection time Secure connection time Network Autonomous system number and name (ASN) via IP mapping SSL negotiation timing DNS timing Time to first byte ASN latitude and longitude for Internet service providers (ISPs) To ensure end user security, New Relic Browser collects GeoIP information for the end user's ISP. New Relic Browser does not collect GeoIP information for the specific end user. For example, if an end user in Portland, Oregon uses an ISP located in Beaverton, Oregon, New Relic Browser collects the GeoIP information for the ISP in Beaverton. User agents Operating systems Browser names or types Browser versions Device types Performance and usage ranges The color-coded legend shows performance and usage as percentile ranges. Performance color ranges Percentile colors for performance range from green (the best) to red (the worst).

Page load timing, individual asset loads, user interactions, AJAX requests, callbacks, errors, and other events appear in an interactive timeline which includes a detailed waterfall visualization, a heat map overview, and highlighted metrics and problems related to that session. Identify problems and solutions Session traces help you understand: How users experience your page load, including time to DOM load, time waiting for AJAX requests to complete, and the user's interactions with the page How the New Relic metrics reflect your end users' experiences What is the sequence of JavaScript and browser events, which take longer than others, and when each event occurs Where bottlenecks occur, and what may be causing them Why one page load may be slower than others, by providing the context for individual events during a session By connecting performance to user experience and interactions to performance, this detailed and intuitive visualization of all events in the user's session can help pinpoint problem areas and easily identify solutions. Requirements To use Browser monitoring's session traces feature, make sure you meet these requirements: Your agent version must support Browser monitoring. If you're using multiple names for an app, session traces will only report to the most specific application. For accounts older than October 2014, you must enable Browser monitoring and the enhanced Pro features. Browser randomly captures traces only from browsers that support the Resource Timing API. Select a session trace The Session traces index lists the most recent traces based on the time picker selection for the selected app. Session traces are randomly sampled and stored at a rate of 90/hour. You can page through up to 500 traces at a time. Additionally, you can sort and search the list by attributes, including: Full URL, with query string parameters removed Browser type Started at date/time Page load time one.newrelic.com > Browser > (select an app) > Session traces: You can select a session trace from the Browser index. You can also select a session trace directly from the Browser Summary, Page views, JS errors, and AJAX pages. To select a specific session trace: Go to one.newrelic.com and click Browser > (select an app) > Session traces. To locate a session trace from a different date or time period, use the time picker. To limit the index to a specific type of trace, use the search window. To view detailed information, select the session trace's link. Tip You can also select a session trace directly from the Browser Summary, Page views, JS errors and AJAX pages. View session trace details The Session trace details page provides summary information about the trace, a heat map with timing details, and a waterfall of events that you can explore. The color-coded legend identifies the page load events during the webpage's life cycle. For apps that have been deployed using the copy/paste method, Browser monitoring includes web app and queue time in Network time as part of the page load timing process. This is because Browser relies on the server-side agent to pass the application values to the Browser agent through auto-injection. You can view detailed information about how this \"back end\" time breaks down from the browser's point of view. The session traces report on all the network related events available, so you can see on a case-by-case basis how the browser spends time on DNS lookups and other network events. one.newrelic.com > Browser > (select an app) > Session traces > (select a trace): Use Browser's session trace details to examine events and identify problems during the end user's webpage session. To navigate through a session trace, explore the waterfall chart by scrolling vertically through the event stack, or select individual events to view their details. If you want to... Do this... View the web page for this session trace Select the trace link. Jump to a specific time Select the time indicator or event on the heat map. View details about individual events Select any event in the waterfall chart. From there, select View full details if applicable. Change the location on the session trace Click on the heat map, or scroll vertically through the waterfall chart. Zoom in or out of the overall trace Select the plus or minus icons below the heat map. Share the session trace information Create a permalink to paste into a form, ticket, email, etc. Session segment definitions Important session trace measurements are displayed in the upper right corner of the Session traces page. The first four measurements represent how long into a session that the segment ended. For example, if Page Load is 0.202s, that means that the page load event completed 0.202 seconds after the request began. Session segment Description Backend The time from when the request began to when backend activity finished and DOM loading began. DOM processing The time from when the request began to when DOM processing finished. Page load The time from when the request began to when the page load event fired. Waiting on AJAX The time from when the request began to when AJAX activity ended. First interaction The time from when the request began to when the first user activity, like a mouse click or a scroll, was recorded. Duration The total duration of the session. Slow JavaScript execution and repainting Session traces help you identify callbacks in your JavaScript code that execute slowly and block the execution of subsequent calls on the browser's main thread. These calls should execute quickly in order to allow the browser to quickly repaint the page in response to user actions. Session traces highlight any callbacks longer than 33ms. If called in rapid succession (such as inside a requestAnimationFrame loop), callbacks longer than 33ms reduce the frame rate below 30 frames per second. This speed seems sluggish to users.",

This document contains: Benefits of this feature Requirements Enable distributed tracing Enable cross-origin resource sharing (CORS) Find and query data Troubleshooting Tip Browser data is available in standard distributed tracing only, not Infinite Tracing. Benefits of browser data in distributed tracing By enabling New Relic to report browser data to distributed tracing, you can see the connection between front-end activity and back-end activity. You can see across a full transaction, from time spent by an end user in the web browser, to network activity, to associated back-end services. Benefits of this feature: Quickly spot latencies, errors, and anomalies in the browser or network Resolve customer-facing problems more quickly All the benefits of distributed tracing applied to your end-user monitoring Requirements and compatibility This feature reports AJAX requests (Fetch and XHR) that occur during a browser interaction. By default, only single-origin requests are monitored unless cross-origin resource sharing is enabled. Make sure you have the minimum versions for your Browser, APM, and APM agents: Browser Pro + SPA, with distributed tracing enabled Browser agent version 1153 or higher Browser agent version 1158 or higher (required for cross-origin resource sharing) Browser agent version 1173 or higher (required for w3c trace context support) APM agent version: C SDK 1.3 or higher Java 5.9.0 or higher PHP 9.4.0 or higher Other APM agent version requirements Enable distributed tracing To enable distributed tracing for Browser monitoring: Make sure you meet requirements, including having: Full-Stack Observability Browser Pro with SPA enabled Go to one.newrelic.com, and click Browser > (select an app) > Settings > Application settings. Turn on the Distributed tracing toggle. By default, for agent version 1173 and above, the newrelic, traceparent, and tracestate headers will be added to all same-origin AJAX requests. Optional: If all of your services are configured to use the w3c trace context headers, you can choose to exclude the newrelic, traceparent, and tracestate headers from requests. Optional: Enable cross-origin resource sharing. Redeploy the Browser agent (either restarting the associated APM agent or updating the copy/paste Browser installation). Enable cross-origin resource sharing (CORS) If you have AJAX requests that need resources from different origins, you can enable cross-origin resource sharing (CORS). By default, distributed tracing for cross-origin requests is not enabled because of browser CORS security restrictions: Distributed tracing is implemented by adding a custom HTTP headers (newrelic, traceparent, and tracestate) to outgoing AJAX requests, and browsers typically do not allow custom headers on cross-origin requests. With the release of agent version 1173, we now support the w3c trace context headers (traceparent and tracestate) so these should also be allowed in your configuration. There are two separate configurations required to enable cross-origin distributed tracing: Configure the service on the different origin to accept the newrelic custom header Configure Browser monitoring to include the target origin in distributed tracing Our step-by-step instructions provide key concepts and steps to enable this feature, but if you need more background about how cross-origin resource sharing works, we recommend this Mozilla developer document. Risks and mitigations Caution Cross-origin resource sharing can expose you to a high level of risk if the services on the different origins are not configured correctly. The AJAX requests will likely return an error, resulting in a variety of failures, including: Resources failing to load (for example, images and key content) Login failures Entire site outages (depending on type of requests enabled) By enabling this cross-origin resource sharing feature, you are acknowledging the following: You understand that this feature is optional and not mandatory. You understand the steps you need to take in order to enable this feature for your services and your domains. You understand that if you do not properly configure your services prior to deployment (including but not limited to configuring your services on your domains to accept custom headers) portions or all of your website will likely malfunction. You understand that New Relic is neither responsible nor liable for errors or issues related to your misconfiguration of servers or services. You fully and solely accept the risks and wish to proceed. The best way to minimize your risk is to ensure you fully understand the process and to try it first in a test environment. Before reading the step-by-step instructions, it may help to first read this overview of the process: To use distributed tracing with cross-origin resources, you populate a list of approved cross-origin resources in New Relic, and then we automatically send the following custom headers to those resources: newrelic, traceparent, and tracestate. For this process to work, you must first ensure that someone has configured the services on the other origins to accept this custom header. Cross-origin resource sharing uses a variety of HTTP headers (both in the request and response). The header that specifically applies to New Relic is the Access-Control-Allow-Headers response header, which can include newrelic, traceparent, tracestate, or newrelic, traceparent, tracestate in its value depending on what tracing strategies you enabled in your APM-monitored application. You must configure your server to return this CORS header in its response. Example: Access-Control-Allow-Headers: newrelic, traceparent, tracestate Important New Relic cannot perform any validation to ensure the services on the other origins were configured correctly. If you're unsure about how to allow these headers, do not add cross-origin resources to the approved list in the New Relic UI. Enable cross-origin resource sharing Caution You should always try enabling CORS in a test environment before setting it up in production. To enable cross-origin resource sharing: Confirm that the services on the other origins are configured to accept the newrelic header using: Access-Control-Allow-Headers: newrelic, traceparent, tracestate (for details, see Risks and mitigations). Confirm that you meet the Browser monitoring requirements. Make sure you are in one.newrelic.com, and click Browser > (select an app) > Application settings. Turn on the Distributed tracing toggle if it's not already enabled. Turn on the Cross-origin resource sharing (CORS) toggle. Under Cross-origin resource sharing (CORS), add cross-origin resources to the approved list. Important Valid cross-origin resources must include: The prefix http:// or https:// The domain name The port number is not required unless it differs from the default for HTTP (port 80) or HTTPS (port 443). Select Save application settings to update the agent configuration. Redeploy the Browser agent (either restarting the associated APM agent or updating the copy/paste Browser installation). Find data Tips for finding and querying data: You can find end-user-originating traces in any New Relic One distributed tracing UI. In the distributed tracing UI, end-user spans are indicated with the icon. To see a span's attributes, select a span in the UI. Spans are reported as Span data, and can be queried in New Relic. Query tips: Query by browser app name by setting browserApp.name to the browser app name. Query for traces containing at least one browser app span with browserApp.name is not null. Query for traces containing at least one back-end app with appName is not null. Query for traces containing both browser and back-end spans by combining the two previous conditions. Troubleshooting If you don't see end-user spans, or are having other distributed tracing issues, see Troubleshooting.",

      "body": "New Relic Browser's Filterable Geography page provides a world view with color-coded performance information about cities, regions, and countries anywhere around the world. You can filter and drill down into detailed information, or use your mouse to select or zoom in and out of any location on the map. The enhanced attributes provide deep visibility not only about your end users' experience with page load timing, but also with network performance anywhere around the world. This level of visual detail is especially useful for professionals in IT and Operations to make business decisions about peering agreements and CDN usage. Contents Requirements Your New Relic Browser subscription level and your time picker settings determine what data you can view: Pro or higher: As of January 2016, the Filterable Geography feature automatically appears in your New Relic Browser user interface. No special setup is required. You can view up to eight days of data. Your application must be enabled to send PageView data to New Relic Insights in order to use Filterable Geography. Lite: The Filterable Geography feature appears in your New Relic Browser's UI menu but currently is not available for use. Any subscription level: If you need to use New Relic Browser's legacy Geography feature, you can still view it from your selected browser app. Factors affecting collected data To capture page load timing information, New Relic Browser uses the Navigation Timing API, which most (but not all) browsers support. If the browsers do not support the Navigation Timing API, then New Relic Browser charts and data points can only show the network data they receive for DNS lookup, connection, secure handshake, etc. This may not be 100% of the app's overall traffic. Also, firewalls may have an impact on the geographical data collected about your end users. View performance data by location one.newrelic.com > Browser > (select an app) > Browser app > Filterable Geography: Here is an example of the map before drilling down into detailed information about London, England. To view or sort the performance information by location: Go to one.newrelic.com > Browser > (select an app) > Filterable Geography. Select the type of performance data to view from the dropdown, or use the default Average page load time. To drill down to a specific area, mouse over or select any area on the geographical map, or select any of the ten worst performing locations from the list to the right of the map. To view specific performance metrics, select any of the attributes below the funnel icon. To view comparison data, select the Page load performance or Historical performance chart below the selected location's geographical map. Use map functions Use any of New Relic's standard user interface functions and page functions to drill down into detailed information. Here is a summary of additional options with the Filterable Geography page. If you want to... Do this... Change what kind of performance data appears Select your choice from the dropdown. Default performance indicator is Average page load time. The map's legend lists the ten best or worst performing areas (depending on the selected performance indicator) for the selected time period. For example: If you select Count, the map's legend shows the top ten locations with the highest number of page loads, as well as the average page load time for each. If you select Connection setup, New Relic Browser first filters out areas with low throughput. Then the map's legend shows the top ten locations where average connection time is the slowest, as well as the average page load time and count for each. View summary performance information about a specific location Mouse over any colored area on the map, select a location from the list, or zoom in and out of any area on the map. View detailed data for a location Select any area of the map. For example: If you select Canada, the map and legend show color-coded performance data for each province and territory. The list to the right of the map shows the top ten worst performing areas. If you select a specific province or territory, the map shows color-coded performance data for the top ten cities. The map includes circled locations which you can mouse over or select to view detailed information. In addition, the Page load performance and Historical performance charts below the map automatically update with each location you select. Hide the list of available attributes Select the funnel icon. Return to a larger world view Select another location on the map, or clear the filter labels above the map. Tip To return to the original map view of the world, select any area on an ocean. Examine heat map details one.newrelic.com > Browser > (select an app) > Browser app > Filterable Geography: Here is an example of the map as you use filter and zoom tools to drill down into detailed information about London, England. Athough overall throughput for the area is good (green), the nearby yellow areas, and the smaller red and orange circles indicate nearby cities with varying levels of throughput problems, not the size of those cities. The Filterable Geography heat map identifies performance quality with color and with the size of circles. Heat map Description Color scale Performance quality ranges from green (the best) to yellow, orange, and then red (the worst). When selecting indicators of usage rather than performance, the heat map shows shades of purple, with the darkest shades indicating the highest usage. The color scale adapts to your app's specific performance. Each area is a percentile range. To view the range for each color segment, mouse over the heat map's legend. Thresholds Different thresholds are dynamically applied to the colors based on the type of performance indicator you select from the dropdown and the maximum value your app has reported. For example, green for Average page load time may indicate 0 to 3.3 seconds, while green for Average network time may indicate 0 to 256 milliseconds. Circles The map's colored circles help you identify areas with performance problems at a glance. Each circle's radius is based on throughput reported for the city it represents, not the size of the city itself. You may see many circles overlapping each other. This usually indicates a grouping of metropolitan areas which represent a geographic area of heavy traffic. Filter performance metrics The Filter feature allows you to select and group data by attributes in various categories, including: Page view Geography Browser Identity Custom The filtered results appear on the geographical map, where you can use any of the standard map functions to explore additional details. Here are some examples. Unsatisfactory network performance by ASN In this example, your organization is preparing to renew a peering agreement with the owner of an autonomous system, called \"My-ASN.\" You are concerned that continued outages and other connection issues are affecting customer satisfaction with your site, and you want to compare its performance with other ASNs. You have a New Relic Browser Pro account. Go to one.newrelic.com > Browser > (select an app) > Filterable Geography. From the performance type dropdown, select Connection setup. Select the funnel icon. To view the specific ASN's performance: From the search window, type My-ASN, and then select this name from the Filter by results. OR To compare performance with other ASNs: From Geography attributes > ASN organizations, review the performance data for each organization on the list, and then select Back to groupings list. To close the filter list, select the funnel icon. Follow standard procedures to use the map functions and view comparative performance details. To clear the filter, select the attribute name. Page rendering performance during sales promotion In this example, your organization has a special three-day sales promotion for an upcoming holiday. Your holiday-merchandise page has undergone major changes, including dozens of new images. You want to look for performance problems with page rendering on Android mobile devices during this sales period. You have a New Relic Browser Pro account. Go to one.newrelic.com > Browser > (select an app) > Filterable Geography. Use the time picker to change the date range to the promotion period. From the performance type dropdown, select Page rendering. Select the funnel icon. From Page view attributes > Page Url, select your site's holiday-merchandise page, and then select Back to groupings list. From Browser attributes > User agent OS, select Android, and then select Back to groupings list. To close the filter list, select the funnel icon. Follow standard procedures to use the map functions and view comparative performance details. To clear the filters, select their attribute names. View comparative performance details Charts on the Page load performance and Historical performance tabs automatically refresh with comparative performance details for the selected location. one.newrelic.com > Browser > (select an app) > Browser app > Filterable Geography: Charts on the Page load performance and Historical performance tabs automatically refresh with details for the selected location. The Page load performance tab shows two charts. The Average page load time chart includes: Average page load time for each segment of the page load timing process in seconds Request queuing information (the time after a request enters your production systems and before it reaches your application) if applicable The Average network time chart shows key elements, including how long it takes for DNS lookup, connection establishment, and secure handshake, in seconds. Tip Sometimes areas on the charts may appear to be zero or near zero. This is because some apps use existing TCP connections, and they do not need to establish new connections. The Historical performance tab shows comparison data for the selected time period, yesterday, and last week for the selected location. This includes: Average response time Throughput in pages per minute (ppm) Available metrics You can filter and group geographical performance data in New Relic Browser and in New Relic Insights. Available metrics include: Performance Metrics Webpage Page load time Throughput (pages per minute or ppm) Network time Connection time Secure connection time Network Autonomous system number and name (ASN) via IP mapping SSL negotiation timing DNS timing Time to first byte ASN latitude and longitude for Internet service providers (ISPs) To ensure end user security, New Relic Browser collects GeoIP information for the end user's ISP. New Relic Browser does not collect GeoIP information for the specific end user. For example, if an end user in Portland, Oregon uses an ISP located in Beaverton, Oregon, New Relic Browser collects the GeoIP information for the ISP in Beaverton. User agents Operating systems Browser names or types Browser versions Device types Performance and usage ranges The color-coded legend shows performance and usage as percentile ranges. Performance color ranges Percentile colors for performance range from green (the best) to red (the worst).

View error profiles To view Browser monitoring error profiles: Go to one.newrelic.com and click Browser > (select an app) > JS errors. To see error profile details: At the bottom of the JS errors UI page, select an error profile to expand it. What are error profiles? In Browser monitoring, an error profile is a potentially meaningful correlation New Relic has found between your JavaScript error attribute values when compared to normal PageView events. These correlations help you investigate the causes and contributing factors behind your errors. The screenshot below shows an example of an error profile. This error profile shows that the distribution of the userAgentOS attribute values varies significantly when JS error events are compared to normal (non-error) page view events. To investigate further, you could use the filter to display only Windows errors and see if there are other correlations. You can also filter the data used to generate error profiles to help you narrow down potential causes. For an analysis of a specific error profile, see the example error profile explanation. Filter error profile data To further filter the data used to generate error profiles and their comparison page views, use these JS errors page features: Time picker: select a time range used to generate the data. Filter: use the filter to display only error profiles and page views that have the attribute values you choose. You can select multiple attribute values. Example error profile explanation To help you better understand your own error profile data, this is an explanation of an example error profile's data. This error profile example has had a filter of userAgentName = Chrome applied, so it is only showing error data from Chrome browsers. This example profile has had a filter applied so that it is only showing error data from Chrome browsers. Column explanations: The first column is the attribute column. It shows the attribute values with the most deviation when compared to non-error page views. Less significant attribute values are aggregated in the Other category. In this example, the Chrome versions 36, 64, and 65 make up 100% of the errors for Chrome users. The JS errors column shows what percentage of JavaScriptError events have the attribute values from the first column. This column adds up to 100%, representing all errors from the chosen time range and filter set. In this example, a large percentage of Chrome errors are coming from Chrome version 36. If we wanted to investigate this further, we could filter to only show version 36 data. The Page views column shows what percentage of PageView events have the attribute values from the first column. In this example, less than 1% of Chrome users use Chrome version 36, but 55% of errors are generated by users with that version. The Difference column shows you the difference in percentage between the JS errors column and the Page views column. In this example, the 54% indicates that attribute is 54 percentage points higher for error events than for page views.",

This document contains: Benefits of this feature Requirements Enable distributed tracing Enable cross-origin resource sharing (CORS) Find and query data Troubleshooting Tip Browser data is available in standard distributed tracing only, not Infinite Tracing. Benefits of browser data in distributed tracing By enabling New Relic to report browser data to distributed tracing, you can see the connection between front-end activity and back-end activity. You can see across a full transaction, from time spent by an end user in the web browser, to network activity, to associated back-end services. Benefits of this feature: Quickly spot latencies, errors, and anomalies in the browser or network Resolve customer-facing problems more quickly All the benefits of distributed tracing applied to your end-user monitoring Requirements and compatibility This feature reports AJAX requests (Fetch and XHR) that occur during a browser interaction. By default, only single-origin requests are monitored unless cross-origin resource sharing is enabled. Make sure you have the minimum versions for your Browser, APM, and APM agents: Browser Pro + SPA, with distributed tracing enabled Browser agent version 1153 or higher Browser agent version 1158 or higher (required for cross-origin resource sharing) Browser agent version 1173 or higher (required for w3c trace context support) APM agent version: C SDK 1.3 or higher Java 5.9.0 or higher PHP 9.4.0 or higher Other APM agent version requirements Enable distributed tracing To enable distributed tracing for Browser monitoring: Make sure you meet requirements, including having: Full-Stack Observability Browser Pro with SPA enabled Go to one.newrelic.com, and click Browser > (select an app) > Settings > Application settings. Turn on the Distributed tracing toggle. By default, for agent version 1173 and above, the newrelic, traceparent, and tracestate headers will be added to all same-origin AJAX requests. Optional: If all of your services are configured to use the w3c trace context headers, you can choose to exclude the newrelic, traceparent, and tracestate headers from requests. Optional: Enable cross-origin resource sharing. Redeploy the Browser agent (either restarting the associated APM agent or updating the copy/paste Browser installation). Enable cross-origin resource sharing (CORS) If you have AJAX requests that need resources from different origins, you can enable cross-origin resource sharing (CORS). By default, distributed tracing for cross-origin requests is not enabled because of browser CORS security restrictions: Distributed tracing is implemented by adding a custom HTTP headers (newrelic, traceparent, and tracestate) to outgoing AJAX requests, and browsers typically do not allow custom headers on cross-origin requests. With the release of agent version 1173, we now support the w3c trace context headers (traceparent and tracestate) so these should also be allowed in your configuration. There are two separate configurations required to enable cross-origin distributed tracing: Configure the service on the different origin to accept the newrelic custom header Configure Browser monitoring to include the target origin in distributed tracing Our step-by-step instructions provide key concepts and steps to enable this feature, but if you need more background about how cross-origin resource sharing works, we recommend this Mozilla developer document. Risks and mitigations Caution Cross-origin resource sharing can expose you to a high level of risk if the services on the different origins are not configured correctly. The AJAX requests will likely return an error, resulting in a variety of failures, including: Resources failing to load (for example, images and key content) Login failures Entire site outages (depending on type of requests enabled) By enabling this cross-origin resource sharing feature, you are acknowledging the following: You understand that this feature is optional and not mandatory. You understand the steps you need to take in order to enable this feature for your services and your domains. You understand that if you do not properly configure your services prior to deployment (including but not limited to configuring your services on your domains to accept custom headers) portions or all of your website will likely malfunction. You understand that New Relic is neither responsible nor liable for errors or issues related to your misconfiguration of servers or services. You fully and solely accept the risks and wish to proceed. The best way to minimize your risk is to ensure you fully understand the process and to try it first in a test environment. Before reading the step-by-step instructions, it may help to first read this overview of the process: To use distributed tracing with cross-origin resources, you populate a list of approved cross-origin resources in New Relic, and then we automatically send the following custom headers to those resources: newrelic, traceparent, and tracestate. For this process to work, you must first ensure that someone has configured the services on the other origins to accept this custom header. Cross-origin resource sharing uses a variety of HTTP headers (both in the request and response). The header that specifically applies to New Relic is the Access-Control-Allow-Headers response header, which can include newrelic, traceparent, tracestate, or newrelic, traceparent, tracestate in its value depending on what tracing strategies you enabled in your APM-monitored application. You must configure your server to return this CORS header in its response. Example: Access-Control-Allow-Headers: newrelic, traceparent, tracestate Important New Relic cannot perform any validation to ensure the services on the other origins were configured correctly. If you're unsure about how to allow these headers, do not add cross-origin resources to the approved list in the New Relic UI. Enable cross-origin resource sharing Caution You should always try enabling CORS in a test environment before setting it up in production. To enable cross-origin resource sharing: Confirm that the services on the other origins are configured to accept the newrelic header using: Access-Control-Allow-Headers: newrelic, traceparent, tracestate (for details, see Risks and mitigations). Confirm that you meet the Browser monitoring requirements. Make sure you are in one.newrelic.com, and click Browser > (select an app) > Application settings. Turn on the Distributed tracing toggle if it's not already enabled. Turn on the Cross-origin resource sharing (CORS) toggle. Under Cross-origin resource sharing (CORS), add cross-origin resources to the approved list. Important Valid cross-origin resources must include: The prefix http:// or https:// The domain name The port number is not required unless it differs from the default for HTTP (port 80) or HTTPS (port 443). Select Save application settings to update the agent configuration. Redeploy the Browser agent (either restarting the associated APM agent or updating the copy/paste Browser installation). Find data Tips for finding and querying data: You can find end-user-originating traces in any New Relic One distributed tracing UI. In the distributed tracing UI, end-user spans are indicated with the icon. To see a span's attributes, select a span in the UI. Spans are reported as Span data, and can be queried in New Relic. Query tips: Query by browser app name by setting browserApp.name to the browser app name. Query for traces containing at least one browser app span with browserApp.name is not null. Query for traces containing at least one back-end app with appName is not null. Query for traces containing both browser and back-end spans by combining the two previous conditions. Troubleshooting If you don't see end-user spans, or are having other distributed tracing issues, see Troubleshooting.",

      "body": "New Relic Browser's Filterable Geography page provides a world view with color-coded performance information about cities, regions, and countries anywhere around the world. You can filter and drill down into detailed information, or use your mouse to select or zoom in and out of any location on the map. The enhanced attributes provide deep visibility not only about your end users' experience with page load timing, but also with network performance anywhere around the world. This level of visual detail is especially useful for professionals in IT and Operations to make business decisions about peering agreements and CDN usage. Contents Requirements Your New Relic Browser subscription level and your time picker settings determine what data you can view: Pro or higher: As of January 2016, the Filterable Geography feature automatically appears in your New Relic Browser user interface. No special setup is required. You can view up to eight days of data. Your application must be enabled to send PageView data to New Relic Insights in order to use Filterable Geography. Lite: The Filterable Geography feature appears in your New Relic Browser's UI menu but currently is not available for use. Any subscription level: If you need to use New Relic Browser's legacy Geography feature, you can still view it from your selected browser app. Factors affecting collected data To capture page load timing information, New Relic Browser uses the Navigation Timing API, which most (but not all) browsers support. If the browsers do not support the Navigation Timing API, then New Relic Browser charts and data points can only show the network data they receive for DNS lookup, connection, secure handshake, etc. This may not be 100% of the app's overall traffic. Also, firewalls may have an impact on the geographical data collected about your end users. View performance data by location one.newrelic.com > Browser > (select an app) > Browser app > Filterable Geography: Here is an example of the map before drilling down into detailed information about London, England. To view or sort the performance information by location: Go to one.newrelic.com > Browser > (select an app) > Filterable Geography. Select the type of performance data to view from the dropdown, or use the default Average page load time. To drill down to a specific area, mouse over or select any area on the geographical map, or select any of the ten worst performing locations from the list to the right of the map. To view specific performance metrics, select any of the attributes below the funnel icon. To view comparison data, select the Page load performance or Historical performance chart below the selected location's geographical map. Use map functions Use any of New Relic's standard user interface functions and page functions to drill down into detailed information. Here is a summary of additional options with the Filterable Geography page. If you want to... Do this... Change what kind of performance data appears Select your choice from the dropdown. Default performance indicator is Average page load time. The map's legend lists the ten best or worst performing areas (depending on the selected performance indicator) for the selected time period. For example: If you select Count, the map's legend shows the top ten locations with the highest number of page loads, as well as the average page load time for each. If you select Connection setup, New Relic Browser first filters out areas with low throughput. Then the map's legend shows the top ten locations where average connection time is the slowest, as well as the average page load time and count for each. View summary performance information about a specific location Mouse over any colored area on the map, select a location from the list, or zoom in and out of any area on the map. View detailed data for a location Select any area of the map. For example: If you select Canada, the map and legend show color-coded performance data for each province and territory. The list to the right of the map shows the top ten worst performing areas. If you select a specific province or territory, the map shows color-coded performance data for the top ten cities. The map includes circled locations which you can mouse over or select to view detailed information. In addition, the Page load performance and Historical performance charts below the map automatically update with each location you select. Hide the list of available attributes Select the funnel icon. Return to a larger world view Select another location on the map, or clear the filter labels above the map. Tip To return to the original map view of the world, select any area on an ocean. Examine heat map details one.newrelic.com > Browser > (select an app) > Browser app > Filterable Geography: Here is an example of the map as you use filter and zoom tools to drill down into detailed information about London, England. Athough overall throughput for the area is good (green), the nearby yellow areas, and the smaller red and orange circles indicate nearby cities with varying levels of throughput problems, not the size of those cities. The Filterable Geography heat map identifies performance quality with color and with the size of circles. Heat map Description Color scale Performance quality ranges from green (the best) to yellow, orange, and then red (the worst). When selecting indicators of usage rather than performance, the heat map shows shades of purple, with the darkest shades indicating the highest usage. The color scale adapts to your app's specific performance. Each area is a percentile range. To view the range for each color segment, mouse over the heat map's legend. Thresholds Different thresholds are dynamically applied to the colors based on the type of performance indicator you select from the dropdown and the maximum value your app has reported. For example, green for Average page load time may indicate 0 to 3.3 seconds, while green for Average network time may indicate 0 to 256 milliseconds. Circles The map's colored circles help you identify areas with performance problems at a glance. Each circle's radius is based on throughput reported for the city it represents, not the size of the city itself. You may see many circles overlapping each other. This usually indicates a grouping of metropolitan areas which represent a geographic area of heavy traffic. Filter performance metrics The Filter feature allows you to select and group data by attributes in various categories, including: Page view Geography Browser Identity Custom The filtered results appear on the geographical map, where you can use any of the standard map functions to explore additional details. Here are some examples. Unsatisfactory network performance by ASN In this example, your organization is preparing to renew a peering agreement with the owner of an autonomous system, called \"My-ASN.\" You are concerned that continued outages and other connection issues are affecting customer satisfaction with your site, and you want to compare its performance with other ASNs. You have a New Relic Browser Pro account. Go to one.newrelic.com > Browser > (select an app) > Filterable Geography. From the performance type dropdown, select Connection setup. Select the funnel icon. To view the specific ASN's performance: From the search window, type My-ASN, and then select this name from the Filter by results. OR To compare performance with other ASNs: From Geography attributes > ASN organizations, review the performance data for each organization on the list, and then select Back to groupings list. To close the filter list, select the funnel icon. Follow standard procedures to use the map functions and view comparative performance details. To clear the filter, select the attribute name. Page rendering performance during sales promotion In this example, your organization has a special three-day sales promotion for an upcoming holiday. Your holiday-merchandise page has undergone major changes, including dozens of new images. You want to look for performance problems with page rendering on Android mobile devices during this sales period. You have a New Relic Browser Pro account. Go to one.newrelic.com > Browser > (select an app) > Filterable Geography. Use the time picker to change the date range to the promotion period. From the performance type dropdown, select Page rendering. Select the funnel icon. From Page view attributes > Page Url, select your site's holiday-merchandise page, and then select Back to groupings list. From Browser attributes > User agent OS, select Android, and then select Back to groupings list. To close the filter list, select the funnel icon. Follow standard procedures to use the map functions and view comparative performance details. To clear the filters, select their attribute names. View comparative performance details Charts on the Page load performance and Historical performance tabs automatically refresh with comparative performance details for the selected location. one.newrelic.com > Browser > (select an app) > Browser app > Filterable Geography: Charts on the Page load performance and Historical performance tabs automatically refresh with details for the selected location. The Page load performance tab shows two charts. The Average page load time chart includes: Average page load time for each segment of the page load timing process in seconds Request queuing information (the time after a request enters your production systems and before it reaches your application) if applicable The Average network time chart shows key elements, including how long it takes for DNS lookup, connection establishment, and secure handshake, in seconds. Tip Sometimes areas on the charts may appear to be zero or near zero. This is because some apps use existing TCP connections, and they do not need to establish new connections. The Historical performance tab shows comparison data for the selected time period, yesterday, and last week for the selected location. This includes: Average response time Throughput in pages per minute (ppm) Available metrics You can filter and group geographical performance data in New Relic Browser and in New Relic Insights. Available metrics include: Performance Metrics Webpage Page load time Throughput (pages per minute or ppm) Network time Connection time Secure connection time Network Autonomous system number and name (ASN) via IP mapping SSL negotiation timing DNS timing Time to first byte ASN latitude and longitude for Internet service providers (ISPs) To ensure end user security, New Relic Browser collects GeoIP information for the end user's ISP. New Relic Browser does not collect GeoIP information for the specific end user. For example, if an end user in Portland, Oregon uses an ISP located in Beaverton, Oregon, New Relic Browser collects the GeoIP information for the ISP in Beaverton. User agents Operating systems Browser names or types Browser versions Device types Performance and usage ranges The color-coded legend shows performance and usage as percentile ranges. Performance color ranges Percentile colors for performance range from green (the best) to red (the worst).

Page load timing, individual asset loads, user interactions, AJAX requests, callbacks, errors, and other events appear in an interactive timeline which includes a detailed waterfall visualization, a heat map overview, and highlighted metrics and problems related to that session. Identify problems and solutions Session traces help you understand: How users experience your page load, including time to DOM load, time waiting for AJAX requests to complete, and the user's interactions with the page How the New Relic metrics reflect your end users' experiences What is the sequence of JavaScript and browser events, which take longer than others, and when each event occurs Where bottlenecks occur, and what may be causing them Why one page load may be slower than others, by providing the context for individual events during a session By connecting performance to user experience and interactions to performance, this detailed and intuitive visualization of all events in the user's session can help pinpoint problem areas and easily identify solutions. Requirements To use Browser monitoring's session traces feature, make sure you meet these requirements: Your agent version must support Browser monitoring. If you're using multiple names for an app, session traces will only report to the most specific application. For accounts older than October 2014, you must enable Browser monitoring and the enhanced Pro features. Browser randomly captures traces only from browsers that support the Resource Timing API. Select a session trace The Session traces index lists the most recent traces based on the time picker selection for the selected app. Session traces are randomly sampled and stored at a rate of 90/hour. You can page through up to 500 traces at a time. Additionally, you can sort and search the list by attributes, including: Full URL, with query string parameters removed Browser type Started at date/time Page load time one.newrelic.com > Browser > (select an app) > Session traces: You can select a session trace from the Browser index. You can also select a session trace directly from the Browser Summary, Page views, JS errors, and AJAX pages. To select a specific session trace: Go to one.newrelic.com and click Browser > (select an app) > Session traces. To locate a session trace from a different date or time period, use the time picker. To limit the index to a specific type of trace, use the search window. To view detailed information, select the session trace's link. Tip You can also select a session trace directly from the Browser Summary, Page views, JS errors and AJAX pages. View session trace details The Session trace details page provides summary information about the trace, a heat map with timing details, and a waterfall of events that you can explore. The color-coded legend identifies the page load events during the webpage's life cycle. For apps that have been deployed using the copy/paste method, Browser monitoring includes web app and queue time in Network time as part of the page load timing process. This is because Browser relies on the server-side agent to pass the application values to the Browser agent through auto-injection. You can view detailed information about how this \"back end\" time breaks down from the browser's point of view. The session traces report on all the network related events available, so you can see on a case-by-case basis how the browser spends time on DNS lookups and other network events. one.newrelic.com > Browser > (select an app) > Session traces > (select a trace): Use Browser's session trace details to examine events and identify problems during the end user's webpage session. To navigate through a session trace, explore the waterfall chart by scrolling vertically through the event stack, or select individual events to view their details. If you want to... Do this... View the web page for this session trace Select the trace link. Jump to a specific time Select the time indicator or event on the heat map. View details about individual events Select any event in the waterfall chart. From there, select View full details if applicable. Change the location on the session trace Click on the heat map, or scroll vertically through the waterfall chart. Zoom in or out of the overall trace Select the plus or minus icons below the heat map. Share the session trace information Create a permalink to paste into a form, ticket, email, etc. Session segment definitions Important session trace measurements are displayed in the upper right corner of the Session traces page. The first four measurements represent how long into a session that the segment ended. For example, if Page Load is 0.202s, that means that the page load event completed 0.202 seconds after the request began. Session segment Description Backend The time from when the request began to when backend activity finished and DOM loading began. DOM processing The time from when the request began to when DOM processing finished. Page load The time from when the request began to when the page load event fired. Waiting on AJAX The time from when the request began to when AJAX activity ended. First interaction The time from when the request began to when the first user activity, like a mouse click or a scroll, was recorded. Duration The total duration of the session. Slow JavaScript execution and repainting Session traces help you identify callbacks in your JavaScript code that execute slowly and block the execution of subsequent calls on the browser's main thread. These calls should execute quickly in order to allow the browser to quickly repaint the page in response to user actions. Session traces highlight any callbacks longer than 33ms. If called in rapid succession (such as inside a requestAnimationFrame loop), callbacks longer than 33ms reduce the frame rate below 30 frames per second. This speed seems sluggish to users.",

This document contains: Benefits of this feature Requirements Enable distributed tracing Enable cross-origin resource sharing (CORS) Find and query data Troubleshooting Tip Browser data is available in standard distributed tracing only, not Infinite Tracing. Benefits of browser data in distributed tracing By enabling New Relic to report browser data to distributed tracing, you can see the connection between front-end activity and back-end activity. You can see across a full transaction, from time spent by an end user in the web browser, to network activity, to associated back-end services. Benefits of this feature: Quickly spot latencies, errors, and anomalies in the browser or network Resolve customer-facing problems more quickly All the benefits of distributed tracing applied to your end-user monitoring Requirements and compatibility This feature reports AJAX requests (Fetch and XHR) that occur during a browser interaction. By default, only single-origin requests are monitored unless cross-origin resource sharing is enabled. Make sure you have the minimum versions for your Browser, APM, and APM agents: Browser Pro + SPA, with distributed tracing enabled Browser agent version 1153 or higher Browser agent version 1158 or higher (required for cross-origin resource sharing) Browser agent version 1173 or higher (required for w3c trace context support) APM agent version: C SDK 1.3 or higher Java 5.9.0 or higher PHP 9.4.0 or higher Other APM agent version requirements Enable distributed tracing To enable distributed tracing for Browser monitoring: Make sure you meet requirements, including having: Full-Stack Observability Browser Pro with SPA enabled Go to one.newrelic.com, and click Browser > (select an app) > Settings > Application settings. Turn on the Distributed tracing toggle. By default, for agent version 1173 and above, the newrelic, traceparent, and tracestate headers will be added to all same-origin AJAX requests. Optional: If all of your services are configured to use the w3c trace context headers, you can choose to exclude the newrelic, traceparent, and tracestate headers from requests. Optional: Enable cross-origin resource sharing. Redeploy the Browser agent (either restarting the associated APM agent or updating the copy/paste Browser installation). Enable cross-origin resource sharing (CORS) If you have AJAX requests that need resources from different origins, you can enable cross-origin resource sharing (CORS). By default, distributed tracing for cross-origin requests is not enabled because of browser CORS security restrictions: Distributed tracing is implemented by adding a custom HTTP headers (newrelic, traceparent, and tracestate) to outgoing AJAX requests, and browsers typically do not allow custom headers on cross-origin requests. With the release of agent version 1173, we now support the w3c trace context headers (traceparent and tracestate) so these should also be allowed in your configuration. There are two separate configurations required to enable cross-origin distributed tracing: Configure the service on the different origin to accept the newrelic custom header Configure Browser monitoring to include the target origin in distributed tracing Our step-by-step instructions provide key concepts and steps to enable this feature, but if you need more background about how cross-origin resource sharing works, we recommend this Mozilla developer document. Risks and mitigations Caution Cross-origin resource sharing can expose you to a high level of risk if the services on the different origins are not configured correctly. The AJAX requests will likely return an error, resulting in a variety of failures, including: Resources failing to load (for example, images and key content) Login failures Entire site outages (depending on type of requests enabled) By enabling this cross-origin resource sharing feature, you are acknowledging the following: You understand that this feature is optional and not mandatory. You understand the steps you need to take in order to enable this feature for your services and your domains. You understand that if you do not properly configure your services prior to deployment (including but not limited to configuring your services on your domains to accept custom headers) portions or all of your website will likely malfunction. You understand that New Relic is neither responsible nor liable for errors or issues related to your misconfiguration of servers or services. You fully and solely accept the risks and wish to proceed. The best way to minimize your risk is to ensure you fully understand the process and to try it first in a test environment. Before reading the step-by-step instructions, it may help to first read this overview of the process: To use distributed tracing with cross-origin resources, you populate a list of approved cross-origin resources in New Relic, and then we automatically send the following custom headers to those resources: newrelic, traceparent, and tracestate. For this process to work, you must first ensure that someone has configured the services on the other origins to accept this custom header. Cross-origin resource sharing uses a variety of HTTP headers (both in the request and response). The header that specifically applies to New Relic is the Access-Control-Allow-Headers response header, which can include newrelic, traceparent, tracestate, or newrelic, traceparent, tracestate in its value depending on what tracing strategies you enabled in your APM-monitored application. You must configure your server to return this CORS header in its response. Example: Access-Control-Allow-Headers: newrelic, traceparent, tracestate Important New Relic cannot perform any validation to ensure the services on the other origins were configured correctly. If you're unsure about how to allow these headers, do not add cross-origin resources to the approved list in the New Relic UI. Enable cross-origin resource sharing Caution You should always try enabling CORS in a test environment before setting it up in production. To enable cross-origin resource sharing: Confirm that the services on the other origins are configured to accept the newrelic header using: Access-Control-Allow-Headers: newrelic, traceparent, tracestate (for details, see Risks and mitigations). Confirm that you meet the Browser monitoring requirements. Make sure you are in one.newrelic.com, and click Browser > (select an app) > Application settings. Turn on the Distributed tracing toggle if it's not already enabled. Turn on the Cross-origin resource sharing (CORS) toggle. Under Cross-origin resource sharing (CORS), add cross-origin resources to the approved list. Important Valid cross-origin resources must include: The prefix http:// or https:// The domain name The port number is not required unless it differs from the default for HTTP (port 80) or HTTPS (port 443). Select Save application settings to update the agent configuration. Redeploy the Browser agent (either restarting the associated APM agent or updating the copy/paste Browser installation). Find data Tips for finding and querying data: You can find end-user-originating traces in any New Relic One distributed tracing UI. In the distributed tracing UI, end-user spans are indicated with the icon. To see a span's attributes, select a span in the UI. Spans are reported as Span data, and can be queried in New Relic. Query tips: Query by browser app name by setting browserApp.name to the browser app name. Query for traces containing at least one browser app span with browserApp.name is not null. Query for traces containing at least one back-end app with appName is not null. Query for traces containing both browser and back-end spans by combining the two previous conditions. Troubleshooting If you don't see end-user spans, or are having other distributed tracing issues, see Troubleshooting.",

      "body": "Browser uses a JavaScript snippet (or \"agent\") to instrument your app's webpages. The JavaScript collects data for browser monitoring. To install the browser agent, you can choose from a number of deployment options. Tip To use Browser and the rest of our observability platform, join the New Relic family! Sign up to create your free account in only a few seconds. Then ingest up to 100GB of data for free each month. Forever. Select a deployment option No matter which option you use to deploy browser monitoring, the end result is to inject the browser agent's JavaScript snippet into your pages for browser monitoring. The method you select depends on your preferences and business needs. To view the procedure to install and enable the browser agent, click the link for the option you want to use. You can also use the Browser Application settings page to update settings. Important The following configuration options refer only to the browser monitoring agent. These are not the same as the New Relic user roles and editions. Browser deployment option Description Use the APM agent to inject the JavaScript You can use an APM agent to automatically inject the browser monitoring JavaScript snippet for you. This is the easiest way to install the agent for an app that already is being monitored by APM. (APM-monitored apps are listed on your APM Applications index.) Paste the JavaScript snippet into a webpage This allows you to control the exact placement of the JavaScript into your app's webpage(s) by copying and pasting the browser agent's JavaScript snippet. This is useful for: Standalone apps, static sites, and cached pages delivered by CDN APM apps that are not as closely coupled to the browser app as with a standard server-side app (for example, when your client-side app talks to a REST API back end) Enable single-page app (SPA) monitoring Enabling SPA requires a Pro + SPA browser agent subscription, and you may need to re-deploy the browser JavaScript agent. Use the REST API The REST API lets you manage deployment outside the browser UI. This is useful for large organizations deploying multiple apps. Use an APM agent API to manually instrument the JavaScript snippet For apps that are monitored by APM, you can use the APM agent's API to inject the JavaScript manually instead of automatically. Enable an APM-monitored app Use this procedure to automatically deploy the browser agent on an app that is monitored by APM: Go to one.newrelic.com, select Browser, and then select Add more data. In the Back-end, front-end, and mobile applications section, select the New Relic Browser tile. When prompted to select the account you want to add this instrumentation to, choose your account, and click Continue. From the Get started with New Relic Browser page, in the Choose a deployment method section, select Enable via New Relic APM. In the Choose your instrumentation section, select Lite, Pro, or Pro + SPA. In the Configure your instrumentation section, make the selections you want. In the Select your application section, type or use the search window to find an app's name. Click Enable. Important Node.js: To finish enabling the browser agent for a Node.js app, follow the additional procedure to insert the JavaScript header into the beginning of your HTML page's head tag. Generate some traffic for your app. Wait a few minutes for Browser to start collecting data, then select your app from the Browser applications index. Enable with copy/paste Use this procedure to insert browser's JavaScript snippet for browser monitoring into your app's webpages yourself. This option is useful for monitoring static sites (such as Jekyll) or cached pages delivered by CDN. Tip Near the bottom of the generated JavaScript is your browser license key and application ID. This is useful with the REST API and API Explorer. Go to one.newrelic.com, select Browser, and then select Add more data. In the Back-end, front-end, and mobile applications section, select the New Relic Browser tile. When prompted to select the account you want to add this instrumentation to, choose your account, and click Continue. From the Get started with New Relic Browser page, in the Choose a deployment method section, select Copy/Paste JavaScript Code. In the Choose your instrumentation section, select the type of agent: Lite, Pro, or Pro + SPA. In the Configure your instrumentation section, make the selections you want. In the Name your app section, name your app: If your app is monitored by APM, select Yes, then type or use the search window to find the app's name. If you have a standalone app for Browser (not monitored by APM), select No, then type the app's name. Click Enable. A new section, Instrument the agent, opens on the page with JavaScript code for your project. Copy the code snippet, then paste it inline into your pages as close to the top of the <head> element as possible, but after any position-sensitive <meta> tags (for example, X-UA-Compatible or charset information). For more information on the inline head placement, see JavaScript placement requirements. Generate some traffic for your app. Wait a few minutes for Browser to start collecting data, then select your app from the Browser applications index. If you use the copy/paste method, but don't finish the setup process, you can still view and copy the generated JavaScript snippet from your app's Browser Application settings page or by using the REST API (v2). Instrument webpages using the APM agent This information applies to apps that are also monitored by APM. New Relic's agents can instrument webpages with the required JavaScript for page load timing. If you use the APM agent to add the JavaScript snippet to your webpages, insert the instrumentation snippet as close to the top as possible. This allows you to take advantage of detailed information about browser's AJAX calls and JavaScript errors. For more information, see the instructions for your APM agent: C SDK Go Java .NET Node.js PHP Python Ruby Troubleshoot Browser agent installation When you enable browser Pro features for session traces, AJAX calls, or JavaScript errors, it may take approximately five minutes before information becomes available. If you have problems with your browser installation or if no data appears after five minutes, refer to the troubleshooting tips, and restart your agent.",

Rename app monitored by APM If you added an app to Browser already being monitored by APM, the app name that appears in Browser is the same as the app name in the APM UI. To rename the app, use any of these options as applicable. Option Comments Rename and continue collecting data This option is useful when you simply want to give an app a different display name (alias). To change the alias that appears in the New Relic UI, use the app's Settings page: Go to one.newrelic.com > APM > (select an app) > Settings > Application. Stop reporting under the old name To stop reporting data under the old name and begin collecting data with a new name (app identifer), use the APM agent's configuration file. This changes the identifier that New Relic's data collector uses to distinguish one app from another. Based on the data retention schedule, New Relic will retain historical data collected under the old name, and will collect and aggregate data under the new name. If one or more apps share the same name, then their data will be aggregated in the UI. Caution If you change the app identifier, a new application will appear in our user interface with the new name, and data will stop reporting to the app(s) with the old name. Rename app via JavaScript snippet This information applies if you inserted Browser's JavaScript snippet into your: App monitored by APM that was deployed via the copy/paste method Single page app (SPA) Any standalone Browser app that is not also monitored by APM You cannot directly edit the JavaScript snippet in the existing app. Instead, to use your app with a different name: Follow standard procedures to create a new app using the copy/paste method. Provide the new name, and generate the JavaScript snippet. Copy the new JavaScript snippet. In your webpage, replace the JavaScript from your original app with the JavaScript generated for the new app name. If your standalone app has multiple names, copy the custom app IDs in your configuration script to your new app. Based on the data retention schedule, New Relic will retain historical data collected under the old name, and will collect and aggregate data under the new name.

      "body": "Browser monitoring includes strict security measures to provide a robust, standalone product with browser monitoring features. Before you install the Browser agent, make sure your system meets these requirements. Basic requirements To report data to Browser, your application must at a minimum meet two basic requirements: The traffic to the application must be from clients able to load and execute Browser JavaScript code and set cookies. Clients accessing the application must be able to send data to New Relic through HTTP requests. HTTPS is required for Browser Pro features. Important Browsers that subscribe to a disconnect list or that use content filtering extensions such as AdBlock may not be able to send data to New Relic. For example, if you are using the Enhanced Tracking Prevention disconnect list for Mozilla Firefox 69.0 or higher, you will need to change the default configuration. Most typical browser applications meet these requirements. However, browser applications in restricted environments may have difficulty reporting data to New Relic; for example: Hybrid mobile applications Applications installed on unusual hardware, such as point-of-sale terminals or consumer appliances For more information, review the instrumentation for browser monitoring documentation, and verify end-user network access. Browser types Instrumentation is compatible with every browser type, including Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox, Microsoft Internet Explorer and Edge, and Apple Safari. The user interface is compatible with New Relic's supported browser versions. Exceptions Comments Paint timings The firstPaint and firstContentfulPaint attributes in BrowserInteraction, PageView, and PageViewTiming events are only compatible with: Chrome 60 or higher for desktop and mobile (Android webview and Chrome for Android) Opera 47 or higher for desktop Opera 44 or higher for Android mobile Samsung Internet for mobile AJAX AJAX timing features are not available with: Chrome for iPhone and iPad IE 7 and 8 PageAction events PageAction events require a browser that fully supports cross-domain XMLHttpRequests. Internet Explorer versions 9 and lower cannot record PageAction events. Learn more on querying your data. Session traces Session traces are reported only from browsers that support the Resource Timing Specification. SHA-256 New Relic can only monitor browsers that are compatible with SHA-256. APM agents You can deploy the Browser agent for apps monitored by APM, or you can deploy the Browser agent for your standalone apps. For more information, see the installation procedures. If you are deploying Browser for an app using APM, make sure your agent supports Browser monitoring: C SDK: Version 1.0.0 or higher Go: Version 2.5.0 or higher Java: Version 3.4.0 or higher .NET: Version 2.20.25.0 or higher Node.js: Version 1.4.0 or higher PHP: Version 4.4.5.35 or higher Python: Version 2.10.1.9 or higher Ruby: Version 3.7.0.177 or higher Supported frameworks The Browser agent collects data on all front-end frameworks. However, the monitoring occurs on lower-level \"primitives\" that JavaScript frameworks use, so the level of detail collected by the instrumentation may vary depending on your specific framework. Exceptions Comments Zone.js If you're using AngularJS and you want to use Browser's SPA monitoring capabilities, note that Zone.js versions 0.6.18 to 0.6.24 are not compatible with Browser. In all cases, the Browser agent must be loaded before Zone.js to avoid errors. Cypress.io Browser is unable to properly instrument the open and send methods of requests when tests are run in Cypress. This will cause the following error to be thrown: Cannot set property 'status' of undefined Copy This will only affect customers running tests with the Browser agent present in their code. Production applications should not be affected. html2pdf.js This library is not compatible with our SPA-enabled Browser agent due to the way this library wraps promises. If you're using this library, we recommend the Browser Pro agent. Content Security Policy (CSP) considerations In order to obtain accurate browser performance metrics, Browser requires the use of a small, inline JavaScript snippet. New Relic carefully reviews the inline JavaScript to prevent Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) and other potential vulnerabilities. Content Security Policy Level 2 adds restrictions to the types of JavaScript allowed, such as inline scripts. It also limits which domains can load scripts during page load. Important If your website does not allow any third-party hosted JavaScript to run, you must request a CSP exception via your organization’s standard procedures in order to install the Browser monitoring agent. When requesting a CSP exception, follow your organization's standard procedures to contact your web or security team. The Browser JavaScript agent requires the following CSP exceptions in order to run properly. Alternatively, you can add all of these exceptions to the fallback default-src directive (instead of script-src and connect-src). CSP exception Comments unsafe-inline Add to the script-src directive or to the fallback default-src directive. This is required because the agent is installed by including an inline script. https://js-agent.newrelic.com Add to the script-src directive or to the fallback default-src directive. This is where additional script files that the agent requires are hosted. https://bam.nr-data.net https://bam-cell.nr-data.net Important Add https://gov-bam.nr-data.net if you're using FedRAMP-compliant endpoints. Add to the script-src directive or to the fallback default-src directive. This is where the agent sends its collected data. One of the calls to this URL is a JSONP call, which means that the URL must be allowed as a script source. Add to the connect-src directive or to the fallback default-src directive. The connect-src directive affects the URLs that scripts can call (for example, using the XMLHttpRequest interface). If you have CSP restrictions specifically around this directive, then add this URL as an exception.",

This document contains: Benefits of this feature Requirements Enable distributed tracing Enable cross-origin resource sharing (CORS) Find and query data Troubleshooting Tip Browser data is available in standard distributed tracing only, not Infinite Tracing. Benefits of browser data in distributed tracing By enabling New Relic to report browser data to distributed tracing, you can see the connection between front-end activity and back-end activity. You can see across a full transaction, from time spent by an end user in the web browser, to network activity, to associated back-end services. Benefits of this feature: Quickly spot latencies, errors, and anomalies in the browser or network Resolve customer-facing problems more quickly All the benefits of distributed tracing applied to your end-user monitoring Requirements and compatibility This feature reports AJAX requests (Fetch and XHR) that occur during a browser interaction. By default, only single-origin requests are monitored unless cross-origin resource sharing is enabled. Make sure you have the minimum versions for your Browser, APM, and APM agents: Browser Pro + SPA, with distributed tracing enabled Browser agent version 1153 or higher Browser agent version 1158 or higher (required for cross-origin resource sharing) Browser agent version 1173 or higher (required for w3c trace context support) APM agent version: C SDK 1.3 or higher Java 5.9.0 or higher PHP 9.4.0 or higher Other APM agent version requirements Enable distributed tracing To enable distributed tracing for Browser monitoring: Make sure you meet requirements, including having: Full-Stack Observability Browser Pro with SPA enabled Go to one.newrelic.com, and click Browser > (select an app) > Settings > Application settings. Turn on the Distributed tracing toggle. By default, for agent version 1173 and above, the newrelic, traceparent, and tracestate headers will be added to all same-origin AJAX requests. Optional: If all of your services are configured to use the w3c trace context headers, you can choose to exclude the newrelic, traceparent, and tracestate headers from requests. Optional: Enable cross-origin resource sharing. Redeploy the Browser agent (either restarting the associated APM agent or updating the copy/paste Browser installation). Enable cross-origin resource sharing (CORS) If you have AJAX requests that need resources from different origins, you can enable cross-origin resource sharing (CORS). By default, distributed tracing for cross-origin requests is not enabled because of browser CORS security restrictions: Distributed tracing is implemented by adding a custom HTTP headers (newrelic, traceparent, and tracestate) to outgoing AJAX requests, and browsers typically do not allow custom headers on cross-origin requests. With the release of agent version 1173, we now support the w3c trace context headers (traceparent and tracestate) so these should also be allowed in your configuration. There are two separate configurations required to enable cross-origin distributed tracing: Configure the service on the different origin to accept the newrelic custom header Configure Browser monitoring to include the target origin in distributed tracing Our step-by-step instructions provide key concepts and steps to enable this feature, but if you need more background about how cross-origin resource sharing works, we recommend this Mozilla developer document. Risks and mitigations Caution Cross-origin resource sharing can expose you to a high level of risk if the services on the different origins are not configured correctly. The AJAX requests will likely return an error, resulting in a variety of failures, including: Resources failing to load (for example, images and key content) Login failures Entire site outages (depending on type of requests enabled) By enabling this cross-origin resource sharing feature, you are acknowledging the following: You understand that this feature is optional and not mandatory. You understand the steps you need to take in order to enable this feature for your services and your domains. You understand that if you do not properly configure your services prior to deployment (including but not limited to configuring your services on your domains to accept custom headers) portions or all of your website will likely malfunction. You understand that New Relic is neither responsible nor liable for errors or issues related to your misconfiguration of servers or services. You fully and solely accept the risks and wish to proceed. The best way to minimize your risk is to ensure you fully understand the process and to try it first in a test environment. Before reading the step-by-step instructions, it may help to first read this overview of the process: To use distributed tracing with cross-origin resources, you populate a list of approved cross-origin resources in New Relic, and then we automatically send the following custom headers to those resources: newrelic, traceparent, and tracestate. For this process to work, you must first ensure that someone has configured the services on the other origins to accept this custom header. Cross-origin resource sharing uses a variety of HTTP headers (both in the request and response). The header that specifically applies to New Relic is the Access-Control-Allow-Headers response header, which can include newrelic, traceparent, tracestate, or newrelic, traceparent, tracestate in its value depending on what tracing strategies you enabled in your APM-monitored application. You must configure your server to return this CORS header in its response. Example: Access-Control-Allow-Headers: newrelic, traceparent, tracestate Important New Relic cannot perform any validation to ensure the services on the other origins were configured correctly. If you're unsure about how to allow these headers, do not add cross-origin resources to the approved list in the New Relic UI. Enable cross-origin resource sharing Caution You should always try enabling CORS in a test environment before setting it up in production. To enable cross-origin resource sharing: Confirm that the services on the other origins are configured to accept the newrelic header using: Access-Control-Allow-Headers: newrelic, traceparent, tracestate (for details, see Risks and mitigations). Confirm that you meet the Browser monitoring requirements. Make sure you are in one.newrelic.com, and click Browser > (select an app) > Application settings. Turn on the Distributed tracing toggle if it's not already enabled. Turn on the Cross-origin resource sharing (CORS) toggle. Under Cross-origin resource sharing (CORS), add cross-origin resources to the approved list. Important Valid cross-origin resources must include: The prefix http:// or https:// The domain name The port number is not required unless it differs from the default for HTTP (port 80) or HTTPS (port 443). Select Save application settings to update the agent configuration. Redeploy the Browser agent (either restarting the associated APM agent or updating the copy/paste Browser installation). Find data Tips for finding and querying data: You can find end-user-originating traces in any New Relic One distributed tracing UI. In the distributed tracing UI, end-user spans are indicated with the icon. To see a span's attributes, select a span in the UI. Spans are reported as Span data, and can be queried in New Relic. Query tips: Query by browser app name by setting browserApp.name to the browser app name. Query for traces containing at least one browser app span with browserApp.name is not null. Query for traces containing at least one back-end app with appName is not null. Query for traces containing both browser and back-end spans by combining the two previous conditions. Troubleshooting If you don't see end-user spans, or are having other distributed tracing issues, see Troubleshooting.",

      "body": "Browser monitoring includes strict security measures to provide a robust, standalone product with browser monitoring features. Before you install the Browser agent, make sure your system meets these requirements. Basic requirements To report data to Browser, your application must at a minimum meet two basic requirements: The traffic to the application must be from clients able to load and execute Browser JavaScript code and set cookies. Clients accessing the application must be able to send data to New Relic through HTTP requests. HTTPS is required for Browser Pro features. Important Browsers that subscribe to a disconnect list or that use content filtering extensions such as AdBlock may not be able to send data to New Relic. For example, if you are using the Enhanced Tracking Prevention disconnect list for Mozilla Firefox 69.0 or higher, you will need to change the default configuration. Most typical browser applications meet these requirements. However, browser applications in restricted environments may have difficulty reporting data to New Relic; for example: Hybrid mobile applications Applications installed on unusual hardware, such as point-of-sale terminals or consumer appliances For more information, review the instrumentation for browser monitoring documentation, and verify end-user network access. Browser types Instrumentation is compatible with every browser type, including Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox, Microsoft Internet Explorer and Edge, and Apple Safari. The user interface is compatible with New Relic's supported browser versions. Exceptions Comments Paint timings The firstPaint and firstContentfulPaint attributes in BrowserInteraction, PageView, and PageViewTiming events are only compatible with: Chrome 60 or higher for desktop and mobile (Android webview and Chrome for Android) Opera 47 or higher for desktop Opera 44 or higher for Android mobile Samsung Internet for mobile AJAX AJAX timing features are not available with: Chrome for iPhone and iPad IE 7 and 8 PageAction events PageAction events require a browser that fully supports cross-domain XMLHttpRequests. Internet Explorer versions 9 and lower cannot record PageAction events. Learn more on querying your data. Session traces Session traces are reported only from browsers that support the Resource Timing Specification. SHA-256 New Relic can only monitor browsers that are compatible with SHA-256. APM agents You can deploy the Browser agent for apps monitored by APM, or you can deploy the Browser agent for your standalone apps. For more information, see the installation procedures. If you are deploying Browser for an app using APM, make sure your agent supports Browser monitoring: C SDK: Version 1.0.0 or higher Go: Version 2.5.0 or higher Java: Version 3.4.0 or higher .NET: Version 2.20.25.0 or higher Node.js: Version 1.4.0 or higher PHP: Version 4.4.5.35 or higher Python: Version 2.10.1.9 or higher Ruby: Version 3.7.0.177 or higher Supported frameworks The Browser agent collects data on all front-end frameworks. However, the monitoring occurs on lower-level \"primitives\" that JavaScript frameworks use, so the level of detail collected by the instrumentation may vary depending on your specific framework. Exceptions Comments Zone.js If you're using AngularJS and you want to use Browser's SPA monitoring capabilities, note that Zone.js versions 0.6.18 to 0.6.24 are not compatible with Browser. In all cases, the Browser agent must be loaded before Zone.js to avoid errors. Cypress.io Browser is unable to properly instrument the open and send methods of requests when tests are run in Cypress. This will cause the following error to be thrown: Cannot set property 'status' of undefined Copy This will only affect customers running tests with the Browser agent present in their code. Production applications should not be affected. html2pdf.js This library is not compatible with our SPA-enabled Browser agent due to the way this library wraps promises. If you're using this library, we recommend the Browser Pro agent. Content Security Policy (CSP) considerations In order to obtain accurate browser performance metrics, Browser requires the use of a small, inline JavaScript snippet. New Relic carefully reviews the inline JavaScript to prevent Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) and other potential vulnerabilities. Content Security Policy Level 2 adds restrictions to the types of JavaScript allowed, such as inline scripts. It also limits which domains can load scripts during page load. Important If your website does not allow any third-party hosted JavaScript to run, you must request a CSP exception via your organization’s standard procedures in order to install the Browser monitoring agent. When requesting a CSP exception, follow your organization's standard procedures to contact your web or security team. The Browser JavaScript agent requires the following CSP exceptions in order to run properly. Alternatively, you can add all of these exceptions to the fallback default-src directive (instead of script-src and connect-src). CSP exception Comments unsafe-inline Add to the script-src directive or to the fallback default-src directive. This is required because the agent is installed by including an inline script. https://js-agent.newrelic.com Add to the script-src directive or to the fallback default-src directive. This is where additional script files that the agent requires are hosted. https://bam.nr-data.net https://bam-cell.nr-data.net Important Add https://gov-bam.nr-data.net if you're using FedRAMP-compliant endpoints. Add to the script-src directive or to the fallback default-src directive. This is where the agent sends its collected data. One of the calls to this URL is a JSONP call, which means that the URL must be allowed as a script source. Add to the connect-src directive or to the fallback default-src directive. The connect-src directive affects the URLs that scripts can call (for example, using the XMLHttpRequest interface). If you have CSP restrictions specifically around this directive, then add this URL as an exception.",

This document contains: Benefits of this feature Requirements Enable distributed tracing Enable cross-origin resource sharing (CORS) Find and query data Troubleshooting Tip Browser data is available in standard distributed tracing only, not Infinite Tracing. Benefits of browser data in distributed tracing By enabling New Relic to report browser data to distributed tracing, you can see the connection between front-end activity and back-end activity. You can see across a full transaction, from time spent by an end user in the web browser, to network activity, to associated back-end services. Benefits of this feature: Quickly spot latencies, errors, and anomalies in the browser or network Resolve customer-facing problems more quickly All the benefits of distributed tracing applied to your end-user monitoring Requirements and compatibility This feature reports AJAX requests (Fetch and XHR) that occur during a browser interaction. By default, only single-origin requests are monitored unless cross-origin resource sharing is enabled. Make sure you have the minimum versions for your Browser, APM, and APM agents: Browser Pro + SPA, with distributed tracing enabled Browser agent version 1153 or higher Browser agent version 1158 or higher (required for cross-origin resource sharing) Browser agent version 1173 or higher (required for w3c trace context support) APM agent version: C SDK 1.3 or higher Java 5.9.0 or higher PHP 9.4.0 or higher Other APM agent version requirements Enable distributed tracing To enable distributed tracing for Browser monitoring: Make sure you meet requirements, including having: Full-Stack Observability Browser Pro with SPA enabled Go to one.newrelic.com, and click Browser > (select an app) > Settings > Application settings. Turn on the Distributed tracing toggle. By default, for agent version 1173 and above, the newrelic, traceparent, and tracestate headers will be added to all same-origin AJAX requests. Optional: If all of your services are configured to use the w3c trace context headers, you can choose to exclude the newrelic, traceparent, and tracestate headers from requests. Optional: Enable cross-origin resource sharing. Redeploy the Browser agent (either restarting the associated APM agent or updating the copy/paste Browser installation). Enable cross-origin resource sharing (CORS) If you have AJAX requests that need resources from different origins, you can enable cross-origin resource sharing (CORS). By default, distributed tracing for cross-origin requests is not enabled because of browser CORS security restrictions: Distributed tracing is implemented by adding a custom HTTP headers (newrelic, traceparent, and tracestate) to outgoing AJAX requests, and browsers typically do not allow custom headers on cross-origin requests. With the release of agent version 1173, we now support the w3c trace context headers (traceparent and tracestate) so these should also be allowed in your configuration. There are two separate configurations required to enable cross-origin distributed tracing: Configure the service on the different origin to accept the newrelic custom header Configure Browser monitoring to include the target origin in distributed tracing Our step-by-step instructions provide key concepts and steps to enable this feature, but if you need more background about how cross-origin resource sharing works, we recommend this Mozilla developer document. Risks and mitigations Caution Cross-origin resource sharing can expose you to a high level of risk if the services on the different origins are not configured correctly. The AJAX requests will likely return an error, resulting in a variety of failures, including: Resources failing to load (for example, images and key content) Login failures Entire site outages (depending on type of requests enabled) By enabling this cross-origin resource sharing feature, you are acknowledging the following: You understand that this feature is optional and not mandatory. You understand the steps you need to take in order to enable this feature for your services and your domains. You understand that if you do not properly configure your services prior to deployment (including but not limited to configuring your services on your domains to accept custom headers) portions or all of your website will likely malfunction.

Benefits of browser data in distributed tracing By enabling New Relic to report browser data to distributed tracing, you can see the connection between front-end activity and back-end activity. You can see across a full transaction, from time spent by an end user in the web browser, to network activity, to associated back-end services. Benefits of this feature: Quickly spot latencies, errors, and anomalies in the browser or network Resolve customer-facing problems more quickly All the benefits of distributed tracing applied to your end-user monitoring Requirements and compatibility This feature reports AJAX requests (Fetch and XHR) that occur during a browser interaction. By default, only single-origin requests are monitored unless cross-origin resource sharing is enabled. Make sure you have the minimum versions for your Browser, APM, and APM agents: Browser Pro + SPA, with distributed tracing enabled Browser agent version 1153 or higher Browser agent version 1158 or higher (required for cross-origin resource sharing) Browser agent version 1173 or higher (required for w3c trace context support) APM agent version: C SDK 1.3 or higher Java 5.9.0 or higher PHP 9.4.0 or higher Other APM agent version requirements Enable distributed tracing To enable distributed tracing for Browser monitoring: Make sure you meet requirements, including having: Full-Stack Observability Browser Pro with SPA enabled Go to one.newrelic.com, and click Browser > (select an app) > Settings > Application settings. Turn on the Distributed tracing toggle. By default, for agent version 1173 and above, the newrelic, traceparent, and tracestate headers will be added to all same-origin AJAX requests. Optional: If all of your services are configured to use the w3c trace context headers, you can choose to exclude the newrelic, traceparent, and tracestate headers from requests. Optional: Enable cross-origin resource sharing. Redeploy the Browser agent (either restarting the associated APM agent or updating the copy/paste Browser installation). Enable cross-origin resource sharing (CORS) If you have AJAX requests that need resources from different origins, you can enable cross-origin resource sharing (CORS). By default, distributed tracing for cross-origin requests is not enabled because of browser CORS security restrictions: Distributed tracing is implemented by adding a custom HTTP headers (newrelic, traceparent, and tracestate) to outgoing AJAX requests, and browsers typically do not allow custom headers on cross-origin requests. With the release of agent version 1173, we now support the w3c trace context headers (traceparent and tracestate) so these should also be allowed in your configuration. There are two separate configurations required to enable cross-origin distributed tracing: Configure the service on the different origin to accept the newrelic custom header Configure Browser monitoring to include the target origin in distributed tracing Our step-by-step instructions provide key concepts and steps to enable this feature, but if you need more background about how cross-origin resource sharing works, we recommend this Mozilla developer document. Risks and mitigations Caution Cross-origin resource sharing can expose you to a high level of risk if the services on the different origins are not configured correctly. The AJAX requests will likely return an error, resulting in a variety of failures, including: Resources failing to load (for example, images and key content) Login failures Entire site outages (depending on type of requests enabled) By enabling this cross-origin resource sharing feature, you are acknowledging the following: You understand that this feature is optional and not mandatory. You understand the steps you need to take in order to enable this feature for your services and your domains. You understand that if you do not properly configure your services prior to deployment (including but not limited to configuring your services on your domains to accept custom headers) portions or all of your website will likely malfunction. You understand that New Relic is neither responsible nor liable for errors or issues related to your misconfiguration of servers or services. You fully and solely accept the risks and wish to proceed. The best way to minimize your risk is to ensure you fully understand the process and to try it first in a test environment. Before reading the step-by-step instructions, it may help to first read this overview of the process: To use distributed tracing with cross-origin resources, you populate a list of approved cross-origin resources in New Relic, and then we automatically send the following custom headers to those resources: newrelic, traceparent, and tracestate. For this process to work, you must first ensure that someone has configured the services on the other origins to accept this custom header. Cross-origin resource sharing uses a variety of HTTP headers (both in the request and response). The header that specifically applies to New Relic is the Access-Control-Allow-Headers response header, which can include newrelic, traceparent, tracestate, or newrelic, traceparent, tracestate in its value depending on what tracing strategies you enabled in your APM-monitored application. You must configure your server to return this CORS header in its response. Example: Access-Control-Allow-Headers: newrelic, traceparent, tracestate Important New Relic cannot perform any validation to ensure the services on the other origins were configured correctly. If you're unsure about how to allow these headers, do not add cross-origin resources to the approved list in the New Relic UI. Enable cross-origin resource sharing Caution You should always try enabling CORS in a test environment before setting it up in production. To enable cross-origin resource sharing: Confirm that the services on the other origins are configured to accept the newrelic header using: Access-Control-Allow-Headers: newrelic, traceparent, tracestate (for details, see Risks and mitigations). Confirm that you meet the Browser monitoring requirements. Make sure you are in one.newrelic.com, and click Browser > (select an app) > Application settings. Turn on the Distributed tracing toggle if it's not already enabled. Turn on the Cross-origin resource sharing (CORS) toggle. Under Cross-origin resource sharing (CORS), add cross-origin resources to the approved list. Important Valid cross-origin resources must include: The prefix http:// or https:// The domain name The port number is not required unless it differs from the default for HTTP (port 80) or HTTPS (port 443). Select Save application settings to update the agent configuration. Redeploy the Browser agent (either restarting the associated APM agent or updating the copy/paste Browser installation). Find data Tips for finding and querying data: You can find end-user-originating traces in any New Relic One distributed tracing UI. In the distributed tracing UI, end-user spans are indicated with the icon. To see a span's attributes, select a span in the UI. Spans are reported as Span data, and can be queried in New Relic. Query tips: Query by browser app name by setting browserApp.name to the browser app name. Query for traces containing at least one browser app span with browserApp.name is not null. Query for traces containing at least one back-end app with appName is not null. Query for traces containing both browser and back-end spans by combining the two previous conditions. Troubleshooting If you don't see end-user spans, or are having other distributed tracing issues, see Troubleshooting.",

To update to the latest version, check your version number, then follow the steps to update an APM-managed installation or to upgrade a copy/paste installation. Check your version number To verify your Browser version number: View the source code of a page which includes the JavaScript snippet. Search the page source for js-agent.newrelic.com/nr-. The numbers that follow nr- are your current version. For example, js-agent.newrelic.com/nr-593.min.js indicates you are running version 593 of the Browser script. The Pro+SPA agent will have the format js-agent.newrelic.com/nr-spa-1184.min.js To verify the latest version of the Browser script loader: Go to js-agent.newrelic.com/nr-loader-full-current.min.js . Search for js-agent.newrelic.com/nr-, then note the numbers that follow nr-. If the latest version number is higher than the number of the version you are currently running, update your Browser agent. Check deployment method Your Browser agent may have been deployed using the copy/paste method rather than injected with APM. To check which deployment method was used, run this command in the JavaScript console: > newrelic.info.sa Copy If the command returns 1, then your Browser agent used the copy/paste method. Update your APM-managed installation To update your APM-managed Browser installation, restart your APM agent. Your app will automatically update to the latest JavaScript snippet. To ensure the new script registers, you may need to clear your cache. For more information, follow the troubleshooting procedures to manually check and clear the cache. Update your copy/paste installation Use any of the following options to access the Browser JavaScript snippet needed to update a copy/paste installation. After accessing the snippet, be sure to replace all of your existing snippet with the new version. If you have a standalone installation with a few applications, you can retrieve the snippet from the UI, and then replace it with the new version. If you have many applications, you can use the REST API or the loader endpoint to automate the update process. Caution Do not simply change the version number in the existing snippet. This can result in incomplete data collection. For best results after you use any of the following options, always update the agent. Retrieve the snippet from the UI Download the latest version of the snippet: Go to one.newrelic.com > Browser > (select an app) > Application settings. This option is only available for standalone installations. Extract the snippet with the REST API To update the snippet using the New Relic REST API, follow the process for viewing a specific Browser app. The loader_script attribute in your response will include the latest JavaScript snippet. This may be a good solution if you have many applications to manage, or if your Browser app is linked to an APM app. Update using the loader endpoint To update the snippet from the New Relic loader endpoint, use the Browser Pro + SPA endpoint, the Browser Pro endpoint, or the Browser Lite endpoint. These endpoints always point to the latest version of the script snippet. Recommendation: Use the Browser Pro or Pro + SPA loaders regardless of your Browser subscription level. These loaders are compatible with both the Pro and Lite subscription levels. These loader endpoints are generic and do not include your specific configuration data. To add your configuration data to the loaders: Find your Browser application ID and license key: Follow standard procedures to use the New Relic UI or the REST API. Set your Browser application ID and license key immediately after the snippet. NREUM.info = { applicationID: \"YOUR-APPLICATION-ID\", licenseKey: \"YOUR-BROWSER-LICENSE-KEY\" }; Copy",

      "body": "Browser monitoring's PageViewTiming event sends each data point as a separate event as soon as it is available. Because we do not restrict the timing, you can receive first paint or first interaction data regardless of when it fires. This document describes why and how to use PageViewTiming and its attributes to query data about your site, component loading, and user performance metrics, both from visual and responsiveness standpoints. Why use PageViewTiming? If your application uses asynchronous or dynamic pages, you may need additional details about site or component loading. But pages can load content in many different ways, and users control when they interact with that content. This is why some user-centric performance metrics happen outside the standard window onload (page load time) in the Browser agent. For example, users may become impatient and begin clicking as soon as content is on the webpage. Or, they may wait to use the page until long after content is loaded. The PageViewTiming event provides a more real-time delivery mechanism that does not have a dependency on any other event. The additional metrics can help you understand how users experience your site, both from visual and responsiveness standpoints. Support for Google's Core Web Vitals We now, with the release of agent version 1177, have full support for Google's Core Web Vitals for 2020. The metrics that make up Core Web Vitals will evolve over time. The current set for 2020 focuses on three aspects of the user experience—loading, interactivity, and visual stability—and includes the following metrics (and their respective thresholds): Core Web Vitals metrics include loading, interactivity, and visual stability. Largest Contentful Paint (LCP): measures loading performance. To provide a good user experience, LCP should occur within 2.5 seconds of when the page first starts loading. First Input Delay (FID): measures interactivity. To provide a good user experience, pages should have a FID of less than 100 milliseconds. Cumulative Layout Shift (CLS): measures visual stability. To provide a good user experience, pages should maintain a CLS of less than 0.1. For each of the above metrics, to ensure you're hitting the recommended target for most of your users, a good threshold to measure is the 75th percentile of page loads, segmented across mobile and desktop devices. To learn more, watch our Nerd Days talk on perceived performance. Detailed visual, interactivity, and responsiveness metrics The BrowserInteraction and PageView events end their reporting when they receive the page window load (or window load and AJAX) timing. However, paint and interactivity metrics can happen at any time. PageViewTiming delivers these metrics as a separate event to: Account for the variability in this timing. Avoid setting an arbitrary timeout. Prevent holding BrowserInteraction and PageView events indefinitely. Additional data Comments firstPaint and firstContentfulPaint The firstPaint and firstContentfulPaint attributes already are available with BrowserInteraction and PageView events. However, they are not always reliably captured before the window onload event fires. Using PageViewTiming gives you a way to capture these metrics even if they happen after the original page load time. This gives you a better understanding of the correlation between responsiveness of that load event and the visual rendering of your content. largestContentfulPaint This new metric, available with agent version 1163, largestContentfulPaint, reports the render time of the largest content element visible in the viewport. Google's research found looking at when the largest element was rendered was a more accurate way to measure when the main content of a page is loaded and useful. Details on this metric, including limitations and considerations can be found in the w3c draft. In addition, we now report the cumulative layout shift (CLS) score attribute with LCP. This attribute is reported as cumulativeLayoutShift. Largest Contentful Paint is one of three metrics identified by Google as the Core Web Vitals. LCP values up to 2.5 secs are considered \"Good\", between 2.5-4.0 secs considered \"Needs Improvement\", and above 4.0 secs considered \"Poor.\" firstInteraction and firstInputDelay With the addition of firstInteraction and firstInputDelay, you can quickly determine the ways that your users are interacting with that visual content. These metrics tell you not only when they interacted, but what type of interaction (mousedown, pointerdown, etc.) and how long it took for them to receive a response from your site. The firstInputDelay metric lies in the middle of FirstContentfulPaint and Time to Interactive (TTI) metrics, measuring the time between when a first input can be made and when the browser's main thread is able to respond to any interactions. In addition, we now report the cumulative layout shift (CLS) score attribute at the moment of the user's first interaction. This attribute is reported as cumulativeLayoutShift. First Input Delay is one of three metrics identified by Google as the Core Web Vitals. FID values up to 100 ms are considered \"Good\", between 100-300 ms considered \"Needs Improvement\", and above 300 ms considered \"Poor.\" For a more detailed explanation, see the Browser release notes. cumulativeLayoutShift Cumulative Layout Shift (CLS), available with agent v1177, is an important, user-centric metric for measuring visual stability because it helps quantify how often users experience unexpected layout shifts—a low CLS helps ensure that the page is delightful. This is one of three metrics identified by Google as the Core Web Vitals. Cumulative Layout Shift is one of three metrics identified by Google as the Core Web Vitals. CLS scores up to 0.1 are considered \"Good\", between 0.1-0.25 considered \"Needs Improvement\", and above 0.25 considered \"Poor.\" timingName You can review different types of activities with the timingName attribute, such as firstPaint, firstContentfulPaint, firstInteraction, largestContentfulPaint, pageHide and windowUnload. For example, a PageViewTiming event may have a timingName of firstPaint and a firstPaint value of .03. The event will also include all default attributes included with the standard BrowserInteraction and PageView events. elementId This is the Id, if specified, of the largestContentfulPaint element. This value will only be reported with the LCP metric. This value can be null. elementSize This is the reported size of the largestContentfulPaint element. This value will only be reported with the LCP metric. pageHide The pageHide event, available with agent v1177, is sent when the browser hides the current page in the process of presenting a different page from the session's history. For example, when the user clicks the browser's Back button, the current page receives a pageHide event before the previous page is shown. Supporting documentation and browser compatibility for the pageHide event can be found in MDN docs. In addition, we now report the cumulative layout shift (CLS) score attribute with pageHide. This attribute is reported as cumulativeLayoutShift. windowLoad The windowLoad event, available with agent v1177, is fired when the whole page has loaded, including all dependent resources such as stylesheets and images. Supporting documentation and browser compatibility for the Window Load event can be found in MDN docs. In addition, we now report the cumulative layout shift (CLS) score attribute with windowLoad. This attribute is reported as cumulativeLayoutShift. windowUnload The windowUnload event, available with agent v1163, is fired when a document or child resource is being unloaded. Supporting documentation and browser compatibility for the Window Unload event can be found in MDN docs. In addition, we now report the cumulative layout shift (CLS) score attribute with windowUnload. This attribute is reported as cumulativeLayoutShift. Compatibility and requirements In addition to Browser's installation requirements, the PageViewTiming event requires Browser agent version 1153 or higher and a Browser Pro subscription. Follow our Browser agent release notes to find out when new metrics are released. These metrics are supported by the following browser versions. For unsupported browsers, no PageViewTiming events will be recorded.

      "body": "If a browser does not use the Navigation timing API for page load timing (sometimes referred to as real user monitoring or RUM), the browser uses a cookie to determine the navigation start time. If a user navigates from a site without page load timing to a site with page load timing (for example, to the first page on your page load timing-enabled site), special considerations for navigation start time arise. Contents Network estimate The page load timing JavaScript utility file creates a cookie with the navigation start time when a user leaves a page (by hooking an event, beforeunload, or pagehide, depending on the browser). However, when navigating away from a site without page load timing enabled, the JavaScript code will not be present, and the cookie will not be created. Then, when the user hits the first page of a site, the navigation start time cannot be determined, because there is no cookie. In this case Browser monitoring has all the data (queue time, app time, DOM content and rendering time) except network time. Navigation start time is required to compute network time. Rather than toss the data, the page load timing feature estimates the network time based on recently accumulated averages for your application, regionally. This way the page load timing feature provides a more accurate throughput measurement, and the rest of the data is retained. This is especially important for sites with a high bounce rate (when users visit only one page). The more visitors you have from different regions, the more accurate the network estimate will be. Network estimate unavailable If a network estimate is not available for your application and for the region where the hit originated, the page load timing process reverts to a network estimate across all reporting apps for the region. Failing that, the data is tossed. Note: For browsers that have the Navigation Timing API, this is not an issue, as the navigation start time can be determined without using a cookie. For more help Additional documentation resources include: Instrumentation for page load timing (JavaScript elements, data transmission) Page load timing process (overview including time segments and colors, differences between app server requests and page load timing, outliers)",

      "body": "This document describes data privacy related to Browser monitoring and cookies, and details about the cookies themselves. Page load timing (sometimes referred to as real user monitoring or RUM) creates the following cookies that Browser monitoring uses when session tracking in end-user browsers. Tip These cookies are related to Browser app monitoring. For more information about data privacy and requesting data to be deleted, see New Relic personal data requests. Data privacy and legal compliance The default Browser agent configuration does not retain any personal data as defined by common privacy laws such as the EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA). New Relic has taken steps to enable our customers who elect to process personal data in our products to do so in accordance with applicable privacy laws. Use the additional information below to help enable your compliance with such laws: Data Description IP addresses New Relic briefly collects and leverages the IP address from the end-user as part of the data collection process. The IP is captured when a connection is made between the end user's browser and the New Relic data collector. The IP address is included in the web request, much like a caller ID. New Relic uses the IP, much like you see a phone number when somebody calls you. The IP address is used as a lookup value that maps to additional details, allowing New Relic customers to diagnose performance issues. IP address lookup values include: countryCode regionCode city asn (Autonomous System Number) asnOrganization (ISP/Business/Institution) asnLatitude asnLongitude The mapping process for the IP address lookup value is typically complete within minutes, but in some extreme cases may take up to 24 hours to process. Once the mapping process is complete, New Relic no longer retains the IP address. Default cookies The Browser monitoring agent sets cookies by default. Cookies are placed by the Browser agent and the New Relic collector. The New Relic collector places a cookie when the Browser agent makes a connection and transmits data. A cookie consent manager that uses a conditional script loader that only loads tags/snippets when a visitor agrees to a specific type of cookies can be used. By choosing this option there is a risk that page performance will not be captured until the visitor has agreed and the Browser agent is running. With the release of Browser agent v1169, you can turn off cookie collection (JSESSIONID and NREUM) for your Browser app by using the Application settings page in the New Relic UI. Once this configuration value is set to false (OFF), you will no longer see the session information in your event data. By default, the value is set to true (ON) for all existing Browser apps as well as newly created ones. For more information, see our documentation about cookie collection and session tracking. Personal data through custom Browser configuration New Relic offers the option to manually configure your agent through the Browser monitoring API. This could be used to capture personal data, subject to the restrictions set forth in the Terms of Service with New Relic. (For example, no credit card numbers or sensitive categories of personal data, which are contractually prohibited.) New Relic responds to the instructions specified by the agents, including collecting personal data that may be custom configured. If you (as the data controller) receive a request from one of your own customers and determine that personal data sent to New Relic for processing must be deleted, see New Relic personal data requests. JSESSIONID The JSESSIONID cookie is used to store a session identifier so that New Relic can monitor session counts for an application. The cookie value is generated by Jetty. Components Description Session identifier This is used by New Relic to monitor session counts for an application. Domain The JSESSIONID cookie is associated with the New Relic domain. Expiration JSESSIONID is a session cookie that is deleted when the browser closes. NREUM This cookie is only created in browsers that do not support the Navigation Timing API. When a browser supports the Navigation Timing API, a native interface can be used to determine navigation start time. Mozilla Firefox versions 7 or higher support the Navigation Timing API. However, a bug exists in Firefox's early implementations of the Navigation Timing API that Browser monitoring works around by using this cookie. Components Description Navigation start time Navigation start time is required to measure end user response time. The cookie is written when the current page unloads (as the next navigation begins). Document location Stored as a hash. The document location is used with the referring page URL to validate that the start time refers to the page that was previously being viewed or refreshed (to avoid using an invalid start time from a different navigation). Referring page URLs Stored as a hash. The referring page URL is used with the document location to validate that the start time refers to the page that was previously being viewed or refreshed (to avoid using an invalid start time from a different navigation). Domain The NREUM cookie is associated with the root path of the domain in which the New Relic agent executes. Expiration NREUM is a session cookie that is deleted when the browser closes. NRAGENT The NRAGENT cookie is set only if you use Browser agent version v443 or lower. It is created when a token is handed out to an end user by the New Relic collector. End-user metrics are communicated to New Relic collectors via a JSONP request from the browser (script retrieval). The returned JavaScript contains a call to set the token identifier which is written to the cookie on the next navigation (when the page unloads). This achieves a cross-domain communication between the New Relic collector and the New Relic agent. This cookie is used to communicate between the New Relic collector aggregating end user metrics and the agent(s) running in the associated web application. A token identifies and correlates application tier transaction traces with corresponding browser traces. Components Description Token identifier The 16-character token identifier helps with cross-domain communication between the New Relic collector and the New Relic agent. Domain The NRAGENT cookie is associated with the root path of the domain in which the New Relic agent executes. Expiration NRAGENT is a session cookie that is deleted when the browser closes.",

      "body": "Browser monitoring's PageViewTiming event sends each data point as a separate event as soon as it is available. Because we do not restrict the timing, you can receive first paint or first interaction data regardless of when it fires. This document describes why and how to use PageViewTiming and its attributes to query data about your site, component loading, and user performance metrics, both from visual and responsiveness standpoints. Why use PageViewTiming? If your application uses asynchronous or dynamic pages, you may need additional details about site or component loading. But pages can load content in many different ways, and users control when they interact with that content. This is why some user-centric performance metrics happen outside the standard window onload (page load time) in the Browser agent. For example, users may become impatient and begin clicking as soon as content is on the webpage. Or, they may wait to use the page until long after content is loaded. The PageViewTiming event provides a more real-time delivery mechanism that does not have a dependency on any other event. The additional metrics can help you understand how users experience your site, both from visual and responsiveness standpoints. Support for Google's Core Web Vitals We now, with the release of agent version 1177, have full support for Google's Core Web Vitals for 2020. The metrics that make up Core Web Vitals will evolve over time. The current set for 2020 focuses on three aspects of the user experience—loading, interactivity, and visual stability—and includes the following metrics (and their respective thresholds): Core Web Vitals metrics include loading, interactivity, and visual stability. Largest Contentful Paint (LCP): measures loading performance. To provide a good user experience, LCP should occur within 2.5 seconds of when the page first starts loading. First Input Delay (FID): measures interactivity. To provide a good user experience, pages should have a FID of less than 100 milliseconds. Cumulative Layout Shift (CLS): measures visual stability. To provide a good user experience, pages should maintain a CLS of less than 0.1. For each of the above metrics, to ensure you're hitting the recommended target for most of your users, a good threshold to measure is the 75th percentile of page loads, segmented across mobile and desktop devices. To learn more, watch our Nerd Days talk on perceived performance. Detailed visual, interactivity, and responsiveness metrics The BrowserInteraction and PageView events end their reporting when they receive the page window load (or window load and AJAX) timing. However, paint and interactivity metrics can happen at any time. PageViewTiming delivers these metrics as a separate event to: Account for the variability in this timing. Avoid setting an arbitrary timeout. Prevent holding BrowserInteraction and PageView events indefinitely. Additional data Comments firstPaint and firstContentfulPaint The firstPaint and firstContentfulPaint attributes already are available with BrowserInteraction and PageView events. However, they are not always reliably captured before the window onload event fires. Using PageViewTiming gives you a way to capture these metrics even if they happen after the original page load time. This gives you a better understanding of the correlation between responsiveness of that load event and the visual rendering of your content. largestContentfulPaint This new metric, available with agent version 1163, largestContentfulPaint, reports the render time of the largest content element visible in the viewport. Google's research found looking at when the largest element was rendered was a more accurate way to measure when the main content of a page is loaded and useful. Details on this metric, including limitations and considerations can be found in the w3c draft. In addition, we now report the cumulative layout shift (CLS) score attribute with LCP. This attribute is reported as cumulativeLayoutShift. Largest Contentful Paint is one of three metrics identified by Google as the Core Web Vitals. LCP values up to 2.5 secs are considered \"Good\", between 2.5-4.0 secs considered \"Needs Improvement\", and above 4.0 secs considered \"Poor.\" firstInteraction and firstInputDelay With the addition of firstInteraction and firstInputDelay, you can quickly determine the ways that your users are interacting with that visual content. These metrics tell you not only when they interacted, but what type of interaction (mousedown, pointerdown, etc.) and how long it took for them to receive a response from your site. The firstInputDelay metric lies in the middle of FirstContentfulPaint and Time to Interactive (TTI) metrics, measuring the time between when a first input can be made and when the browser's main thread is able to respond to any interactions. In addition, we now report the cumulative layout shift (CLS) score attribute at the moment of the user's first interaction. This attribute is reported as cumulativeLayoutShift. First Input Delay is one of three metrics identified by Google as the Core Web Vitals. FID values up to 100 ms are considered \"Good\", between 100-300 ms considered \"Needs Improvement\", and above 300 ms considered \"Poor.\" For a more detailed explanation, see the Browser release notes. cumulativeLayoutShift Cumulative Layout Shift (CLS), available with agent v1177, is an important, user-centric metric for measuring visual stability because it helps quantify how often users experience unexpected layout shifts—a low CLS helps ensure that the page is delightful. This is one of three metrics identified by Google as the Core Web Vitals. Cumulative Layout Shift is one of three metrics identified by Google as the Core Web Vitals. CLS scores up to 0.1 are considered \"Good\", between 0.1-0.25 considered \"Needs Improvement\", and above 0.25 considered \"Poor.\" timingName You can review different types of activities with the timingName attribute, such as firstPaint, firstContentfulPaint, firstInteraction, largestContentfulPaint, pageHide and windowUnload. For example, a PageViewTiming event may have a timingName of firstPaint and a firstPaint value of .03. The event will also include all default attributes included with the standard BrowserInteraction and PageView events. elementId This is the Id, if specified, of the largestContentfulPaint element. This value will only be reported with the LCP metric. This value can be null. elementSize This is the reported size of the largestContentfulPaint element. This value will only be reported with the LCP metric. pageHide The pageHide event, available with agent v1177, is sent when the browser hides the current page in the process of presenting a different page from the session's history. For example, when the user clicks the browser's Back button, the current page receives a pageHide event before the previous page is shown. Supporting documentation and browser compatibility for the pageHide event can be found in MDN docs. In addition, we now report the cumulative layout shift (CLS) score attribute with pageHide. This attribute is reported as cumulativeLayoutShift. windowLoad The windowLoad event, available with agent v1177, is fired when the whole page has loaded, including all dependent resources such as stylesheets and images. Supporting documentation and browser compatibility for the Window Load event can be found in MDN docs. In addition, we now report the cumulative layout shift (CLS) score attribute with windowLoad. This attribute is reported as cumulativeLayoutShift. windowUnload The windowUnload event, available with agent v1163, is fired when a document or child resource is being unloaded. Supporting documentation and browser compatibility for the Window Unload event can be found in MDN docs. In addition, we now report the cumulative layout shift (CLS) score attribute with windowUnload. This attribute is reported as cumulativeLayoutShift. Compatibility and requirements In addition to Browser's installation requirements, the PageViewTiming event requires Browser agent version 1153 or higher and a Browser Pro subscription. Follow our Browser agent release notes to find out when new metrics are released. These metrics are supported by the following browser versions.

      "body": "If a browser does not use the Navigation timing API for page load timing (sometimes referred to as real user monitoring or RUM), the browser uses a cookie to determine the navigation start time. If a user navigates from a site without page load timing to a site with page load timing (for example, to the first page on your page load timing-enabled site), special considerations for navigation start time arise. Contents Network estimate The page load timing JavaScript utility file creates a cookie with the navigation start time when a user leaves a page (by hooking an event, beforeunload, or pagehide, depending on the browser). However, when navigating away from a site without page load timing enabled, the JavaScript code will not be present, and the cookie will not be created. Then, when the user hits the first page of a site, the navigation start time cannot be determined, because there is no cookie. In this case Browser monitoring has all the data (queue time, app time, DOM content and rendering time) except network time. Navigation start time is required to compute network time. Rather than toss the data, the page load timing feature estimates the network time based on recently accumulated averages for your application, regionally. This way the page load timing feature provides a more accurate throughput measurement, and the rest of the data is retained. This is especially important for sites with a high bounce rate (when users visit only one page). The more visitors you have from different regions, the more accurate the network estimate will be. Network estimate unavailable If a network estimate is not available for your application and for the region where the hit originated, the page load timing process reverts to a network estimate across all reporting apps for the region. Failing that, the data is tossed. Note: For browsers that have the Navigation Timing API, this is not an issue, as the navigation start time can be determined without using a cookie.

This document contains: Benefits of this feature Requirements Enable distributed tracing Enable cross-origin resource sharing (CORS) Find and query data Troubleshooting Tip Browser data is available in standard distributed tracing only, not Infinite Tracing. Benefits of browser data in distributed tracing By enabling New Relic to report browser data to distributed tracing, you can see the connection between front-end activity and back-end activity. You can see across a full transaction, from time spent by an end user in the web browser, to network activity, to associated back-end services. Benefits of this feature: Quickly spot latencies, errors, and anomalies in the browser or network Resolve customer-facing problems more quickly All the benefits of distributed tracing applied to your end-user monitoring Requirements and compatibility This feature reports AJAX requests (Fetch and XHR) that occur during a browser interaction. By default, only single-origin requests are monitored unless cross-origin resource sharing is enabled. Make sure you have the minimum versions for your Browser, APM, and APM agents: Browser Pro + SPA, with distributed tracing enabled Browser agent version 1153 or higher Browser agent version 1158 or higher (required for cross-origin resource sharing) Browser agent version 1173 or higher (required for w3c trace context support) APM agent version: C SDK 1.3 or higher Java 5.9.0 or higher PHP 9.4.0 or higher Other APM agent version requirements Enable distributed tracing To enable distributed tracing for Browser monitoring: Make sure you meet requirements, including having: Full-Stack Observability Browser Pro with SPA enabled Go to one.newrelic.com, and click Browser > (select an app) > Settings > Application settings. Turn on the Distributed tracing toggle. By default, for agent version 1173 and above, the newrelic, traceparent, and tracestate headers will be added to all same-origin AJAX requests. Optional: If all of your services are configured to use the w3c trace context headers, you can choose to exclude the newrelic, traceparent, and tracestate headers from requests. Optional: Enable cross-origin resource sharing. Redeploy the Browser agent (either restarting the associated APM agent or updating the copy/paste Browser installation). Enable cross-origin resource sharing (CORS) If you have AJAX requests that need resources from different origins, you can enable cross-origin resource sharing (CORS). By default, distributed tracing for cross-origin requests is not enabled because of browser CORS security restrictions: Distributed tracing is implemented by adding a custom HTTP headers (newrelic, traceparent, and tracestate) to outgoing AJAX requests, and browsers typically do not allow custom headers on cross-origin requests. With the release of agent version 1173, we now support the w3c trace context headers (traceparent and tracestate) so these should also be allowed in your configuration. There are two separate configurations required to enable cross-origin distributed tracing: Configure the service on the different origin to accept the newrelic custom header Configure Browser monitoring to include the target origin in distributed tracing Our step-by-step instructions provide key concepts and steps to enable this feature, but if you need more background about how cross-origin resource sharing works, we recommend this Mozilla developer document. Risks and mitigations Caution Cross-origin resource sharing can expose you to a high level of risk if the services on the different origins are not configured correctly. The AJAX requests will likely return an error, resulting in a variety of failures, including: Resources failing to load (for example, images and key content) Login failures Entire site outages (depending on type of requests enabled) By enabling this cross-origin resource sharing feature, you are acknowledging the following: You understand that this feature is optional and not mandatory. You understand the steps you need to take in order to enable this feature for your services and your domains. You understand that if you do not properly configure your services prior to deployment (including but not limited to configuring your services on your domains to accept custom headers) portions or all of your website will likely malfunction. You understand that New Relic is neither responsible nor liable for errors or issues related to your misconfiguration of servers or services. You fully and solely accept the risks and wish to proceed. The best way to minimize your risk is to ensure you fully understand the process and to try it first in a test environment. Before reading the step-by-step instructions, it may help to first read this overview of the process: To use distributed tracing with cross-origin resources, you populate a list of approved cross-origin resources in New Relic, and then we automatically send the following custom headers to those resources: newrelic, traceparent, and tracestate. For this process to work, you must first ensure that someone has configured the services on the other origins to accept this custom header. Cross-origin resource sharing uses a variety of HTTP headers (both in the request and response). The header that specifically applies to New Relic is the Access-Control-Allow-Headers response header, which can include newrelic, traceparent, tracestate, or newrelic, traceparent, tracestate in its value depending on what tracing strategies you enabled in your APM-monitored application. You must configure your server to return this CORS header in its response. Example: Access-Control-Allow-Headers: newrelic, traceparent, tracestate Important New Relic cannot perform any validation to ensure the services on the other origins were configured correctly. If you're unsure about how to allow these headers, do not add cross-origin resources to the approved list in the New Relic UI. Enable cross-origin resource sharing Caution You should always try enabling CORS in a test environment before setting it up in production. To enable cross-origin resource sharing: Confirm that the services on the other origins are configured to accept the newrelic header using: Access-Control-Allow-Headers: newrelic, traceparent, tracestate (for details, see Risks and mitigations). Confirm that you meet the Browser monitoring requirements. Make sure you are in one.newrelic.com, and click Browser > (select an app) > Application settings. Turn on the Distributed tracing toggle if it's not already enabled. Turn on the Cross-origin resource sharing (CORS) toggle. Under Cross-origin resource sharing (CORS), add cross-origin resources to the approved list. Important Valid cross-origin resources must include: The prefix http:// or https:// The domain name The port number is not required unless it differs from the default for HTTP (port 80) or HTTPS (port 443). Select Save application settings to update the agent configuration. Redeploy the Browser agent (either restarting the associated APM agent or updating the copy/paste Browser installation). Find data Tips for finding and querying data: You can find end-user-originating traces in any New Relic One distributed tracing UI. In the distributed tracing UI, end-user spans are indicated with the icon. To see a span's attributes, select a span in the UI. Spans are reported as Span data, and can be queried in New Relic. Query tips: Query by browser app name by setting browserApp.name to the browser app name. Query for traces containing at least one browser app span with browserApp.name is not null. Query for traces containing at least one back-end app with appName is not null. Query for traces containing both browser and back-end spans by combining the two previous conditions. Troubleshooting If you don't see end-user spans, or are having other distributed tracing issues, see Troubleshooting.",

      "body": "Problem You're looking for performance breakdowns for specific pages or endpoints on the browser monitoring Page views UI page or AJAX UI page. The UI doesn't show the URL group you're looking for, or it only shows / and /*. This behavior also appears in SPA data in BrowserInteraction events and applies to browserInteractionName, targetGroupedUrl, and previousGroupedUrl attributes. Solution Browser monitoring automatically \"learns\" to group your page views when your application is first deployed, and it adds that information to an allow list for URLs. Sometimes this grouping may not match your current page view information. To solve this problem, manage your application's URL segment list settings by editing existing rules or by adding the domains and URL segments that make up your site's URLs. After you add the necessary rules, you should see a useful breakdown of your information in the UI. Here are some useful tips: Adding segments to your allow list Tip Use constant URL segments. Only add the URL segments that remain constant across many page views. Do not add unique segments such as IDs or highly-specific categories, because this can lead to metric grouping issues. Enter exact matches. Enter any URL segments as exact matches, including case. Use existing rules. If a rule already appears for a domain: Go to one.newrelic.com > Browser > (select an app) > Settings > Segment allow lists. Rather than creating a new rule, edit the existing rule, and add the domain to the UI's Allow listed segments field. Group sub-domains. Group similar sub-domains such as foo.domain.com and bar.domain.com under *.domain.com. This grouping must occur just before the top-level domain name. Set up single-page apps. If your site is a single-page application and you only see / under page views, then your grouping is working correctly. New Relic records subsequent requests as AJAX loads, and your AJAX page will contain more detailed information. If it doesn't, then follow the tips in this document. Remove rules when appropriate. If you need to remove a rule, get support at support.newrelic.com.",

      "body": "Browser uses a JavaScript snippet (or \"agent\") to instrument your app's webpages. The JavaScript collects data for browser monitoring. To install the browser agent, you can choose from a number of deployment options. Tip To use Browser and the rest of our observability platform, join the New Relic family! Sign up to create your free account in only a few seconds. Then ingest up to 100GB of data for free each month. Forever. Select a deployment option No matter which option you use to deploy browser monitoring, the end result is to inject the browser agent's JavaScript snippet into your pages for browser monitoring. The method you select depends on your preferences and business needs. To view the procedure to install and enable the browser agent, click the link for the option you want to use. You can also use the Browser Application settings page to update settings. Important The following configuration options refer only to the browser monitoring agent. These are not the same as the New Relic user roles and editions. Browser deployment option Description Use the APM agent to inject the JavaScript You can use an APM agent to automatically inject the browser monitoring JavaScript snippet for you. This is the easiest way to install the agent for an app that already is being monitored by APM. (APM-monitored apps are listed on your APM Applications index.) Paste the JavaScript snippet into a webpage This allows you to control the exact placement of the JavaScript into your app's webpage(s) by copying and pasting the browser agent's JavaScript snippet. This is useful for: Standalone apps, static sites, and cached pages delivered by CDN APM apps that are not as closely coupled to the browser app as with a standard server-side app (for example, when your client-side app talks to a REST API back end) Enable single-page app (SPA) monitoring Enabling SPA requires a Pro + SPA browser agent subscription, and you may need to re-deploy the browser JavaScript agent. Use the REST API The REST API lets you manage deployment outside the browser UI. This is useful for large organizations deploying multiple apps. Use an APM agent API to manually instrument the JavaScript snippet For apps that are monitored by APM, you can use the APM agent's API to inject the JavaScript manually instead of automatically. Enable an APM-monitored app Use this procedure to automatically deploy the browser agent on an app that is monitored by APM: Go to one.newrelic.com, select Browser, and then select Add more data. In the Back-end, front-end, and mobile applications section, select the New Relic Browser tile. When prompted to select the account you want to add this instrumentation to, choose your account, and click Continue. From the Get started with New Relic Browser page, in the Choose a deployment method section, select Enable via New Relic APM. In the Choose your instrumentation section, select Lite, Pro, or Pro + SPA. In the Configure your instrumentation section, make the selections you want. In the Select your application section, type or use the search window to find an app's name. Click Enable. Important Node.js: To finish enabling the browser agent for a Node.js app, follow the additional procedure to insert the JavaScript header into the beginning of your HTML page's head tag. Generate some traffic for your app. Wait a few minutes for Browser to start collecting data, then select your app from the Browser applications index. Enable with copy/paste Use this procedure to insert browser's JavaScript snippet for browser monitoring into your app's webpages yourself. This option is useful for monitoring static sites (such as Jekyll) or cached pages delivered by CDN. Tip Near the bottom of the generated JavaScript is your browser license key and application ID. This is useful with the REST API and API Explorer. Go to one.newrelic.com, select Browser, and then select Add more data. In the Back-end, front-end, and mobile applications section, select the New Relic Browser tile. When prompted to select the account you want to add this instrumentation to, choose your account, and click Continue. From the Get started with New Relic Browser page, in the Choose a deployment method section, select Copy/Paste JavaScript Code. In the Choose your instrumentation section, select the type of agent: Lite, Pro, or Pro + SPA. In the Configure your instrumentation section, make the selections you want. In the Name your app section, name your app: If your app is monitored by APM, select Yes, then type or use the search window to find the app's name. If you have a standalone app for Browser (not monitored by APM), select No, then type the app's name. Click Enable. A new section, Instrument the agent, opens on the page with JavaScript code for your project. Copy the code snippet, then paste it inline into your pages as close to the top of the <head> element as possible, but after any position-sensitive <meta> tags (for example, X-UA-Compatible or charset information). For more information on the inline head placement, see JavaScript placement requirements. Generate some traffic for your app. Wait a few minutes for Browser to start collecting data, then select your app from the Browser applications index. If you use the copy/paste method, but don't finish the setup process, you can still view and copy the generated JavaScript snippet from your app's Browser Application settings page or by using the REST API (v2). Instrument webpages using the APM agent This information applies to apps that are also monitored by APM. New Relic's agents can instrument webpages with the required JavaScript for page load timing. If you use the APM agent to add the JavaScript snippet to your webpages, insert the instrumentation snippet as close to the top as possible. This allows you to take advantage of detailed information about browser's AJAX calls and JavaScript errors. For more information, see the instructions for your APM agent: C SDK Go Java .NET Node.js PHP Python Ruby Troubleshoot Browser agent installation When you enable browser Pro features for session traces, AJAX calls, or JavaScript errors, it may take approximately five minutes before information becomes available. If you have problems with your browser installation or if no data appears after five minutes, refer to the troubleshooting tips, and restart your agent.",

      "body": "If you use Browser to monitor end-user browser activity, you can now see end-user-originating browser-side traces in distributed tracing. This document contains: Benefits of this feature Requirements Enable distributed tracing Enable cross-origin resource sharing (CORS) Find and query data Troubleshooting Tip Browser data is available in standard distributed tracing only, not Infinite Tracing. Benefits of browser data in distributed tracing By enabling New Relic to report browser data to distributed tracing, you can see the connection between front-end activity and back-end activity. You can see across a full transaction, from time spent by an end user in the web browser, to network activity, to associated back-end services. Benefits of this feature: Quickly spot latencies, errors, and anomalies in the browser or network Resolve customer-facing problems more quickly All the benefits of distributed tracing applied to your end-user monitoring Requirements and compatibility This feature reports AJAX requests (Fetch and XHR) that occur during a browser interaction. By default, only single-origin requests are monitored unless cross-origin resource sharing is enabled. Make sure you have the minimum versions for your Browser, APM, and APM agents: Browser Pro + SPA, with distributed tracing enabled Browser agent version 1153 or higher Browser agent version 1158 or higher (required for cross-origin resource sharing) Browser agent version 1173 or higher (required for w3c trace context support) APM agent version: C SDK 1.3 or higher Java 5.9.0 or higher PHP 9.4.0 or higher Other APM agent version requirements Enable distributed tracing To enable distributed tracing for Browser monitoring: Make sure you meet requirements, including having: Full-Stack Observability Browser Pro with SPA enabled Go to one.newrelic.com, and click Browser > (select an app) > Settings > Application settings. Turn on the Distributed tracing toggle. By default, for agent version 1173 and above, the newrelic, traceparent, and tracestate headers will be added to all same-origin AJAX requests. Optional: If all of your services are configured to use the w3c trace context headers, you can choose to exclude the newrelic, traceparent, and tracestate headers from requests. Optional: Enable cross-origin resource sharing. Redeploy the Browser agent (either restarting the associated APM agent or updating the copy/paste Browser installation). Enable cross-origin resource sharing (CORS) If you have AJAX requests that need resources from different origins, you can enable cross-origin resource sharing (CORS). By default, distributed tracing for cross-origin requests is not enabled because of browser CORS security restrictions: Distributed tracing is implemented by adding a custom HTTP headers (newrelic, traceparent, and tracestate) to outgoing AJAX requests, and browsers typically do not allow custom headers on cross-origin requests. With the release of agent version 1173, we now support the w3c trace context headers (traceparent and tracestate) so these should also be allowed in your configuration. There are two separate configurations required to enable cross-origin distributed tracing: Configure the service on the different origin to accept the newrelic custom header Configure Browser monitoring to include the target origin in distributed tracing Our step-by-step instructions provide key concepts and steps to enable this feature, but if you need more background about how cross-origin resource sharing works, we recommend this Mozilla developer document. Risks and mitigations Caution Cross-origin resource sharing can expose you to a high level of risk if the services on the different origins are not configured correctly. The AJAX requests will likely return an error, resulting in a variety of failures, including: Resources failing to load (for example, images and key content) Login failures Entire site outages (depending on type of requests enabled) By enabling this cross-origin resource sharing feature, you are acknowledging the following: You understand that this feature is optional and not mandatory. You understand the steps you need to take in order to enable this feature for your services and your domains. You understand that if you do not properly configure your services prior to deployment (including but not limited to configuring your services on your domains to accept custom headers) portions or all of your website will likely malfunction. You understand that New Relic is neither responsible nor liable for errors or issues related to your misconfiguration of servers or services. You fully and solely accept the risks and wish to proceed. The best way to minimize your risk is to ensure you fully understand the process and to try it first in a test environment. Before reading the step-by-step instructions, it may help to first read this overview of the process: To use distributed tracing with cross-origin resources, you populate a list of approved cross-origin resources in New Relic, and then we automatically send the following custom headers to those resources: newrelic, traceparent, and tracestate. For this process to work, you must first ensure that someone has configured the services on the other origins to accept this custom header. Cross-origin resource sharing uses a variety of HTTP headers (both in the request and response). The header that specifically applies to New Relic is the Access-Control-Allow-Headers response header, which can include newrelic, traceparent, tracestate, or newrelic, traceparent, tracestate in its value depending on what tracing strategies you enabled in your APM-monitored application. You must configure your server to return this CORS header in its response. Example: Access-Control-Allow-Headers: newrelic, traceparent, tracestate Important New Relic cannot perform any validation to ensure the services on the other origins were configured correctly. If you're unsure about how to allow these headers, do not add cross-origin resources to the approved list in the New Relic UI. Enable cross-origin resource sharing Caution You should always try enabling CORS in a test environment before setting it up in production. To enable cross-origin resource sharing: Confirm that the services on the other origins are configured to accept the newrelic header using: Access-Control-Allow-Headers: newrelic, traceparent, tracestate (for details, see Risks and mitigations). Confirm that you meet the Browser monitoring requirements. Make sure you are in one.newrelic.com, and click Browser > (select an app) > Application settings. Turn on the Distributed tracing toggle if it's not already enabled. Turn on the Cross-origin resource sharing (CORS) toggle. Under Cross-origin resource sharing (CORS), add cross-origin resources to the approved list. Important Valid cross-origin resources must include: The prefix http:// or https:// The domain name The port number is not required unless it differs from the default for HTTP (port 80) or HTTPS (port 443). Select Save application settings to update the agent configuration. Redeploy the Browser agent (either restarting the associated APM agent or updating the copy/paste Browser installation). Find data Tips for finding and querying data: You can find end-user-originating traces in any New Relic One distributed tracing UI. In the distributed tracing UI, end-user spans are indicated with the icon. To see a span's attributes, select a span in the UI. Spans are reported as Span data, and can be queried in New Relic. Query tips: Query by browser app name by setting browserApp.name to the browser app name. Query for traces containing at least one browser app span with browserApp.name is not null. Query for traces containing at least one back-end app with appName is not null. Query for traces containing both browser and back-end spans by combining the two previous conditions. Troubleshooting If you don't see end-user spans, or are having other distributed tracing issues, see Troubleshooting.",

      "body": "Problem You're looking for performance breakdowns for specific pages or endpoints on the browser monitoring Page views UI page or AJAX UI page. The UI doesn't show the URL group you're looking for, or it only shows / and /*. This behavior also appears in SPA data in BrowserInteraction events and applies to browserInteractionName, targetGroupedUrl, and previousGroupedUrl attributes. Solution Browser monitoring automatically \"learns\" to group your page views when your application is first deployed, and it adds that information to an allow list for URLs. Sometimes this grouping may not match your current page view information. To solve this problem, manage your application's URL segment list settings by editing existing rules or by adding the domains and URL segments that make up your site's URLs. After you add the necessary rules, you should see a useful breakdown of your information in the UI. Here are some useful tips: Adding segments to your allow list Tip Use constant URL segments. Only add the URL segments that remain constant across many page views. Do not add unique segments such as IDs or highly-specific categories, because this can lead to metric grouping issues. Enter exact matches. Enter any URL segments as exact matches, including case. Use existing rules. If a rule already appears for a domain: Go to one.newrelic.com > Browser > (select an app) > Settings > Segment allow lists. Rather than creating a new rule, edit the existing rule, and add the domain to the UI's Allow listed segments field. Group sub-domains. Group similar sub-domains such as foo.domain.com and bar.domain.com under *.domain.com. This grouping must occur just before the top-level domain name. Set up single-page apps. If your site is a single-page application and you only see / under page views, then your grouping is working correctly. New Relic records subsequent requests as AJAX loads, and your AJAX page will contain more detailed information. If it doesn't, then follow the tips in this document. Remove rules when appropriate. If you need to remove a rule, get support at support.newrelic.com.",

To install the browser agent, you can choose from a number of deployment options. Tip To use Browser and the rest of our observability platform, join the New Relic family! Sign up to create your free account in only a few seconds. Then ingest up to 100GB of data for free each month. Forever. Select a deployment option No matter which option you use to deploy browser monitoring, the end result is to inject the browser agent's JavaScript snippet into your pages for browser monitoring. The method you select depends on your preferences and business needs. To view the procedure to install and enable the browser agent, click the link for the option you want to use. You can also use the Browser Application settings page to update settings. Important The following configuration options refer only to the browser monitoring agent. These are not the same as the New Relic user roles and editions. Browser deployment option Description Use the APM agent to inject the JavaScript You can use an APM agent to automatically inject the browser monitoring JavaScript snippet for you. This is the easiest way to install the agent for an app that already is being monitored by APM. (APM-monitored apps are listed on your APM Applications index.) Paste the JavaScript snippet into a webpage This allows you to control the exact placement of the JavaScript into your app's webpage(s) by copying and pasting the browser agent's JavaScript snippet. This is useful for: Standalone apps, static sites, and cached pages delivered by CDN APM apps that are not as closely coupled to the browser app as with a standard server-side app (for example, when your client-side app talks to a REST API back end) Enable single-page app (SPA) monitoring Enabling SPA requires a Pro + SPA browser agent subscription, and you may need to re-deploy the browser JavaScript agent. Use the REST API The REST API lets you manage deployment outside the browser UI. This is useful for large organizations deploying multiple apps. Use an APM agent API to manually instrument the JavaScript snippet For apps that are monitored by APM, you can use the APM agent's API to inject the JavaScript manually instead of automatically. Enable an APM-monitored app Use this procedure to automatically deploy the browser agent on an app that is monitored by APM: Go to one.newrelic.com, select Browser, and then select Add more data. In the Back-end, front-end, and mobile applications section, select the New Relic Browser tile. When prompted to select the account you want to add this instrumentation to, choose your account, and click Continue. From the Get started with New Relic Browser page, in the Choose a deployment method section, select Enable via New Relic APM. In the Choose your instrumentation section, select Lite, Pro, or Pro + SPA. In the Configure your instrumentation section, make the selections you want. In the Select your application section, type or use the search window to find an app's name. Click Enable. Important Node.js: To finish enabling the browser agent for a Node.js app, follow the additional procedure to insert the JavaScript header into the beginning of your HTML page's head tag. Generate some traffic for your app. Wait a few minutes for Browser to start collecting data, then select your app from the Browser applications index. Enable with copy/paste Use this procedure to insert browser's JavaScript snippet for browser monitoring into your app's webpages yourself. This option is useful for monitoring static sites (such as Jekyll) or cached pages delivered by CDN. Tip Near the bottom of the generated JavaScript is your browser license key and application ID. This is useful with the REST API and API Explorer. Go to one.newrelic.com, select Browser, and then select Add more data. In the Back-end, front-end, and mobile applications section, select the New Relic Browser tile. When prompted to select the account you want to add this instrumentation to, choose your account, and click Continue. From the Get started with New Relic Browser page, in the Choose a deployment method section, select Copy/Paste JavaScript Code. In the Choose your instrumentation section, select the type of agent: Lite, Pro, or Pro + SPA. In the Configure your instrumentation section, make the selections you want. In the Name your app section, name your app: If your app is monitored by APM, select Yes, then type or use the search window to find the app's name. If you have a standalone app for Browser (not monitored by APM), select No, then type the app's name. Click Enable. A new section, Instrument the agent, opens on the page with JavaScript code for your project. Copy the code snippet, then paste it inline into your pages as close to the top of the <head> element as possible, but after any position-sensitive <meta> tags (for example, X-UA-Compatible or charset information). For more information on the inline head placement, see JavaScript placement requirements. Generate some traffic for your app. Wait a few minutes for Browser to start collecting data, then select your app from the Browser applications index. If you use the copy/paste method, but don't finish the setup process, you can still view and copy the generated JavaScript snippet from your app's Browser Application settings page or by using the REST API (v2). Instrument webpages using the APM agent This information applies to apps that are also monitored by APM. New Relic's agents can instrument webpages with the required JavaScript for page load timing. If you use the APM agent to add the JavaScript snippet to your webpages, insert the instrumentation snippet as close to the top as possible. This allows you to take advantage of detailed information about browser's AJAX calls and JavaScript errors. For more information, see the instructions for your APM agent: C SDK Go Java .NET Node.js PHP Python Ruby Troubleshoot Browser agent installation When you enable browser Pro features for session traces, AJAX calls, or JavaScript errors, it may take approximately five minutes before information becomes available. If you have problems with your browser installation or if no data appears after five minutes, refer to the troubleshooting tips, and restart your agent.",

In addition: For browser apps that are also monitored by APM, you can view the back-end transactions associated with the page view; for example, ApplicationsController#Show. For URLs that are also monitored by Synthetics, you can use New Relic's comparative charting feature. This provides a direct page load time comparison between real user (Browser) interactions and trends appearing in Synthetics monitors. one.newrelic.com > Browser > (select an app) > Page views: This page provides detailed information about page load time, throughput, top transactions, and traces. To view detailed information about which pages the end users are viewing for your app: Go to one.newrelic.com > Browser > (select an app) > Page views. Select the time period or sort order, or keep the defaults. If available, select the type of view for page load timing information as a chart (default), histogram, or percentile. To view summary information about a specific transaction, mouse over the transaction's name on the list. To compare page load time between real user (Browser) interactions and trends appearing in Synthetic monitors, select a page monitored by Synthetics, then examine additional comparative charting details. Examine timing details for page loads The Browser page load time chart view shows the average page load time broken down into segments. This chart also appears on the Browser Summary page and Browsers detail page. one.newrelic.com > Browser > (select an app) > Page views: The Browser page load time chart shows the average page load time broken down into segments indicating the end users' experience (sometimes referred to as real user monitoring or RUM). The page load timing process shows colored-coded details: Page load timing process Description Request queuing (black) Wait time between the web server and the application code. Large numbers indicate a busy application server. Web application (purple) Time spent in the application code. Network (brown) The network latency, or the time it takes for a request to make a round trip over the Internet.

This document contains: Benefits of this feature Requirements Enable distributed tracing Enable cross-origin resource sharing (CORS) Find and query data Troubleshooting Tip Browser data is available in standard distributed tracing only, not Infinite Tracing. Benefits of browser data in distributed tracing By enabling New Relic to report browser data to distributed tracing, you can see the connection between front-end activity and back-end activity. You can see across a full transaction, from time spent by an end user in the web browser, to network activity, to associated back-end services. Benefits of this feature: Quickly spot latencies, errors, and anomalies in the browser or network Resolve customer-facing problems more quickly All the benefits of distributed tracing applied to your end-user monitoring Requirements and compatibility This feature reports AJAX requests (Fetch and XHR) that occur during a browser interaction. By default, only single-origin requests are monitored unless cross-origin resource sharing is enabled. Make sure you have the minimum versions for your Browser, APM, and APM agents: Browser Pro + SPA, with distributed tracing enabled Browser agent version 1153 or higher Browser agent version 1158 or higher (required for cross-origin resource sharing) Browser agent version 1173 or higher (required for w3c trace context support) APM agent version: C SDK 1.3 or higher Java 5.9.0 or higher PHP 9.4.0 or higher Other APM agent version requirements Enable distributed tracing To enable distributed tracing for Browser monitoring: Make sure you meet requirements, including having: Full-Stack Observability Browser Pro with SPA enabled Go to one.newrelic.com, and click Browser > (select an app) > Settings > Application settings. Turn on the Distributed tracing toggle. By default, for agent version 1173 and above, the newrelic, traceparent, and tracestate headers will be added to all same-origin AJAX requests. Optional: If all of your services are configured to use the w3c trace context headers, you can choose to exclude the newrelic, traceparent, and tracestate headers from requests. Optional: Enable cross-origin resource sharing. Redeploy the Browser agent (either restarting the associated APM agent or updating the copy/paste Browser installation). Enable cross-origin resource sharing (CORS) If you have AJAX requests that need resources from different origins, you can enable cross-origin resource sharing (CORS). By default, distributed tracing for cross-origin requests is not enabled because of browser CORS security restrictions: Distributed tracing is implemented by adding a custom HTTP headers (newrelic, traceparent, and tracestate) to outgoing AJAX requests, and browsers typically do not allow custom headers on cross-origin requests. With the release of agent version 1173, we now support the w3c trace context headers (traceparent and tracestate) so these should also be allowed in your configuration. There are two separate configurations required to enable cross-origin distributed tracing: Configure the service on the different origin to accept the newrelic custom header Configure Browser monitoring to include the target origin in distributed tracing Our step-by-step instructions provide key concepts and steps to enable this feature, but if you need more background about how cross-origin resource sharing works, we recommend this Mozilla developer document. Risks and mitigations Caution Cross-origin resource sharing can expose you to a high level of risk if the services on the different origins are not configured correctly. The AJAX requests will likely return an error, resulting in a variety of failures, including: Resources failing to load (for example, images and key content) Login failures Entire site outages (depending on type of requests enabled) By enabling this cross-origin resource sharing feature, you are acknowledging the following: You understand that this feature is optional and not mandatory. You understand the steps you need to take in order to enable this feature for your services and your domains. You understand that if you do not properly configure your services prior to deployment (including but not limited to configuring your services on your domains to accept custom headers) portions or all of your website will likely malfunction. You understand that New Relic is neither responsible nor liable for errors or issues related to your misconfiguration of servers or services. You fully and solely accept the risks and wish to proceed. The best way to minimize your risk is to ensure you fully understand the process and to try it first in a test environment. Before reading the step-by-step instructions, it may help to first read this overview of the process: To use distributed tracing with cross-origin resources, you populate a list of approved cross-origin resources in New Relic, and then we automatically send the following custom headers to those resources: newrelic, traceparent, and tracestate. For this process to work, you must first ensure that someone has configured the services on the other origins to accept this custom header. Cross-origin resource sharing uses a variety of HTTP headers (both in the request and response). The header that specifically applies to New Relic is the Access-Control-Allow-Headers response header, which can include newrelic, traceparent, tracestate, or newrelic, traceparent, tracestate in its value depending on what tracing strategies you enabled in your APM-monitored application. You must configure your server to return this CORS header in its response. Example: Access-Control-Allow-Headers: newrelic, traceparent, tracestate Important New Relic cannot perform any validation to ensure the services on the other origins were configured correctly. If you're unsure about how to allow these headers, do not add cross-origin resources to the approved list in the New Relic UI. Enable cross-origin resource sharing Caution You should always try enabling CORS in a test environment before setting it up in production. To enable cross-origin resource sharing: Confirm that the services on the other origins are configured to accept the newrelic header using: Access-Control-Allow-Headers: newrelic, traceparent, tracestate (for details, see Risks and mitigations). Confirm that you meet the Browser monitoring requirements. Make sure you are in one.newrelic.com, and click Browser > (select an app) > Application settings. Turn on the Distributed tracing toggle if it's not already enabled. Turn on the Cross-origin resource sharing (CORS) toggle. Under Cross-origin resource sharing (CORS), add cross-origin resources to the approved list. Important Valid cross-origin resources must include: The prefix http:// or https:// The domain name The port number is not required unless it differs from the default for HTTP (port 80) or HTTPS (port 443). Select Save application settings to update the agent configuration. Redeploy the Browser agent (either restarting the associated APM agent or updating the copy/paste Browser installation). Find data Tips for finding and querying data: You can find end-user-originating traces in any New Relic One distributed tracing UI. In the distributed tracing UI, end-user spans are indicated with the icon. To see a span's attributes, select a span in the UI. Spans are reported as Span data, and can be queried in New Relic. Query tips: Query by browser app name by setting browserApp.name to the browser app name. Query for traces containing at least one browser app span with browserApp.name is not null. Query for traces containing at least one back-end app with appName is not null. Query for traces containing both browser and back-end spans by combining the two previous conditions. Troubleshooting If you don't see end-user spans, or are having other distributed tracing issues, see Troubleshooting.",

Optional: Enable cross-origin resource sharing. Redeploy the Browser agent (either restarting the associated APM agent or updating the copy/paste Browser installation). Enable cross-origin resource sharing (CORS) If you have AJAX requests that need resources from different origins, you can enable cross-origin resource sharing (CORS). By default, distributed tracing for cross-origin requests is not enabled because of browser CORS security restrictions: Distributed tracing is implemented by adding a custom HTTP headers (newrelic, traceparent, and tracestate) to outgoing AJAX requests, and browsers typically do not allow custom headers on cross-origin requests. With the release of agent version 1173, we now support the w3c trace context headers (traceparent and tracestate) so these should also be allowed in your configuration. There are two separate configurations required to enable cross-origin distributed tracing: Configure the service on the different origin to accept the newrelic custom header Configure Browser monitoring to include the target origin in distributed tracing Our step-by-step instructions provide key concepts and steps to enable this feature, but if you need more background about how cross-origin resource sharing works, we recommend this Mozilla developer document. Risks and mitigations Caution Cross-origin resource sharing can expose you to a high level of risk if the services on the different origins are not configured correctly. The AJAX requests will likely return an error, resulting in a variety of failures, including: Resources failing to load (for example, images and key content) Login failures Entire site outages (depending on type of requests enabled) By enabling this cross-origin resource sharing feature, you are acknowledging the following: You understand that this feature is optional and not mandatory. You understand the steps you need to take in order to enable this feature for your services and your domains. You understand that if you do not properly configure your services prior to deployment (including but not limited to configuring your services on your domains to accept custom headers) portions or all of your website will likely malfunction. You understand that New Relic is neither responsible nor liable for errors or issues related to your misconfiguration of servers or services. You fully and solely accept the risks and wish to proceed. The best way to minimize your risk is to ensure you fully understand the process and to try it first in a test environment. Before reading the step-by-step instructions, it may help to first read this overview of the process: To use distributed tracing with cross-origin resources, you populate a list of approved cross-origin resources in New Relic, and then we automatically send the following custom headers to those resources: newrelic, traceparent, and tracestate. For this process to work, you must first ensure that someone has configured the services on the other origins to accept this custom header. Cross-origin resource sharing uses a variety of HTTP headers (both in the request and response). The header that specifically applies to New Relic is the Access-Control-Allow-Headers response header, which can include newrelic, traceparent, tracestate, or newrelic, traceparent, tracestate in its value depending on what tracing strategies you enabled in your APM-monitored application. You must configure your server to return this CORS header in its response. Example: Access-Control-Allow-Headers: newrelic, traceparent, tracestate Important New Relic cannot perform any validation to ensure the services on the other origins were configured correctly. If you're unsure about how to allow these headers, do not add cross-origin resources to the approved list in the New Relic UI. Enable cross-origin resource sharing Caution You should always try enabling CORS in a test environment before setting it up in production. To enable cross-origin resource sharing: Confirm that the services on the other origins are configured to accept the newrelic header using: Access-Control-Allow-Headers: newrelic, traceparent, tracestate (for details, see Risks and mitigations). Confirm that you meet the Browser monitoring requirements. Make sure you are in one.newrelic.com, and click Browser > (select an app) > Application settings. Turn on the Distributed tracing toggle if it's not already enabled. Turn on the Cross-origin resource sharing (CORS) toggle. Under Cross-origin resource sharing (CORS), add cross-origin resources to the approved list. Important Valid cross-origin resources must include: The prefix http:// or https:// The domain name The port number is not required unless it differs from the default for HTTP (port 80) or HTTPS (port 443). Select Save application settings to update the agent configuration. Redeploy the Browser agent (either restarting the associated APM agent or updating the copy/paste Browser installation). Find data Tips for finding and querying data: You can find end-user-originating traces in any New Relic One distributed tracing UI. In the distributed tracing UI, end-user spans are indicated with the icon. To see a span's attributes, select a span in the UI. Spans are reported as Span data, and can be queried in New Relic. Query tips: Query by browser app name by setting browserApp.name to the browser app name. Query for traces containing at least one browser app span with browserApp.name is not null. Query for traces containing at least one back-end app with appName is not null. Query for traces containing both browser and back-end spans by combining the two previous conditions. Troubleshooting If you don't see end-user spans, or are having other distributed tracing issues, see Troubleshooting.",

Requirements Agent version nr-593 or higher. Description This API call sends a Browser PageAction event with your user-defined name and optional attributes to dashboards, along with several default attributes. This is useful to track any event that is not already tracked automatically by the Browser agent, such as clicking a Subscribe button or accessing a tutorial. PageAction events are sent to New Relic One every 30 seconds, with a maximum of 120 events per 30-second harvest cycle, per browser. After the 120-event limit is reached, additional events are not captured for that harvest cycle. Parameters Parameter Description $name string Required. Name or category of the action. Reports to New Relic One as the actionName attribute. Avoid using reserved NRQL words when you name the attribute or value. $attributes JSON object Optional. JSON object with one or more key/value pairs. For example: {key:\"value\"}. The key will report to New Relic One as its own PageAction attribute with the specified values.

The actionName is copy-text-button and the value is reported as another attribute called Result that corresponds to methods named success and error that handle the outcome. $('.copy-text').click(function (){ var clipboard = new Clipboard ('.copy-text'); clipboard.on('success', function(event) { // Do stuff // Report data to New Relic One if (typeof newrelic == 'object') { newrelic.addPageAction('copy-text-button', {result: 'success'}); } }); clipboard.on('error', function(event) { // Do stuff // Report data to New Relic One if (typeof newrelic == 'object') { newrelic.addPageAction('copy-text-button', {result: 'error'}); } }); }); Copy Then in the query builder, you can create a pie chart to see the breakdown of how many button clicks resulted in success versus error over the past 30 days: SELECT count(*) AS 'Clicks' FROM PageAction WHERE actionName = 'copy-text-button' FACET result SINCE 30 days ago Copy Or you can create a query to see what pages have the most copy button clicks in the last 30 days: SELECT count(*) AS 'Clicks' FROM PageAction WHERE actionName = 'copy-text-button' FACET currentUrl SINCE 30 days ago Copy Capture form input This example captures user input (email addresses) from a form called Signup.

Requirements Agent version nr-593 or higher. Description The Browser API call adds a user-defined attribute name and value to subsequent events on the page. Make this call before the window load event fires (when that data is transmitted) in order for the attributes to be included in the PageView event. Once an attribute is set, New Relic One records it with all PageAction events until the page is reloaded or the attribute is manually unset. If you are using SPA monitoring with a compatible agent version, attributes set with this call will also be included in newrelic.interaction events. However, attributes set using the SPA API will take precedence over these attributes. Errors for custom attributes will be included in events on the JS Errors page. To view or log errors for a custom attribute via API, use the Browser API's noticeError call. Parameters Parameter Description $name string Required. Name of the attribute. Appears as column in the PageView event. It will also appear as a column in the PageAction event if you are using it. Avoid using reserved NRQL words when you name the attribute/value. $value string OR integer Required. Value of the attribute. Appears as the value in the named attribute column in the PageView event. It will appear as a column in the PageAction event if you are using it. Custom attribute values cannot be complex objects, only simple types such as Strings and Integers. Avoid using reserved NRQL words when you name the attribute/value.

Description This API call sends a Browser PageAction event with your user-defined name and optional attributes to dashboards, along with several default attributes. This is useful to track any event that is not already tracked automatically by the Browser agent, such as clicking a Subscribe button or accessing a tutorial. PageAction events are sent to New Relic One every 30 seconds, with a maximum of 120 events per 30-second harvest cycle, per browser. After the 120-event limit is reached, additional events are not captured for that harvest cycle. Parameters Parameter Description $name string Required. Name or category of the action. Reports to New Relic One as the actionName attribute. Avoid using reserved NRQL words when you name the attribute or value. $attributes JSON object Optional. JSON object with one or more key/value pairs. For example: {key:\"value\"}. The key will report to New Relic One as its own PageAction attribute with the specified values. Avoid using reserved NRQL words when you name the attribute/value. Examples Record link clicks (JavaScript) This example records a PageAction event whenever a user selects the Try Me link.

Requirements Agent version nr-593 or higher. Description This API call sends a Browser PageAction event with your user-defined name and optional attributes to dashboards, along with several default attributes. This is useful to track any event that is not already tracked automatically by the Browser agent, such as clicking a Subscribe button or accessing a tutorial. PageAction events are sent to New Relic One every 30 seconds, with a maximum of 120 events per 30-second harvest cycle, per browser. After the 120-event limit is reached, additional events are not captured for that harvest cycle. Parameters Parameter Description $name string Required. Name or category of the action. Reports to New Relic One as the actionName attribute. Avoid using reserved NRQL words when you name the attribute or value. $attributes JSON object Optional. JSON object with one or more key/value pairs. For example: {key:\"value\"}. The key will report to New Relic One as its own PageAction attribute with the specified values. Avoid using reserved NRQL words when you name the attribute/value. Examples Record link clicks (JavaScript) This example records a PageAction event whenever a user selects the Try Me link. The event is recorded with an actionName of clickedTryMe: < a href=\"/demo\" id=\"try-me\" >Try Me!< /a> <script> document.getElementById('try-me').addEventListener('click',function (e) { newrelic.addPageAction('clickedTryMe'); }) </script> Copy You can then query the number of times the Try Me button was clicked with the following NRQL query: SELECT count(*) FROM PageAction WHERE actionName='clickedTryMe' SINCE 1 hour ago Copy Record link clicks (jQuery) This example sends a PageAction event when a user clicks on an element with the class copy-text. The actionName is copy-text-button and the value is reported as another attribute called Result that corresponds to methods named success and error that handle the outcome. $('.copy-text').click(function (){ var clipboard = new Clipboard ('.copy-text'); clipboard.on('success', function(event) { // Do stuff // Report data to New Relic One if (typeof newrelic == 'object') { newrelic.addPageAction('copy-text-button', {result: 'success'}); } }); clipboard.on('error', function(event) { // Do stuff // Report data to New Relic One if (typeof newrelic == 'object') { newrelic.addPageAction('copy-text-button', {result: 'error'}); } }); }); Copy Then in the query builder, you can create a pie chart to see the breakdown of how many button clicks resulted in success versus error over the past 30 days: SELECT count(*) AS 'Clicks' FROM PageAction WHERE actionName = 'copy-text-button' FACET result SINCE 30 days ago Copy Or you can create a query to see what pages have the most copy button clicks in the last 30 days: SELECT count(*) AS 'Clicks' FROM PageAction WHERE actionName = 'copy-text-button' FACET currentUrl SINCE 30 days ago Copy Capture form input This example captures user input (email addresses) from a form called Signup. The event is recorded with an actionName of userSignup: <form action=\"/signup\" id=\"myform\"> <input id=\"email\" name=\"email\"> <input type=\"submit\" value=\"Signup\"> </form> <script type=\"text/javascript\"> document.getElementById('myform').addEventListener('submit', function (e) { var email = e.target.elements['email'].value; newrelic.addPageAction('userSignup', {email: email}); }) </script> Copy You can then see the emails that you gathered with the following NRQL query: SELECT uniques(email) FROM PageAction WHERE actionName='userSignup' SINCE 1 hour ago Copy",

You must call this method to override this behavior and guarantee the interaction will be recorded. Return values This method returns the same API object created by interaction(), which is associated with a BrowserInteraction event. Examples /* window.addEventListener('scroll', () => { if (atBottomOfPage()) { newrelic.interaction() // Start monitoring this interaction. .setName('loadNextPage') // Set name of interaction. .save(); // Ensure that this interaction will be saved as a BrowserInteraction event when it ends. loadNextPage() // Start loading the next page. } }) */ Copy",

New interaction: If the API calls it when New Relic is not currently monitoring an interaction, a new interaction is created. New object: If the API calls it again within the same interaction, a new object referencing the current interaction is created. Parameters The parameters depend on the specific SPA interaction API call. Return values This method returns an API object that is bound to a specific BrowserInteraction event.

The methods can also be used on a handle you assign with a variable.

Requirements Agent version nr-593 or higher. Description This API call sends a Browser PageAction event with your user-defined name and optional attributes to dashboards, along with several default attributes. This is useful to track any event that is not already tracked automatically by the Browser agent, such as clicking a Subscribe button or accessing a tutorial. PageAction events are sent to New Relic One every 30 seconds, with a maximum of 120 events per 30-second harvest cycle, per browser. After the 120-event limit is reached, additional events are not captured for that harvest cycle. Parameters Parameter Description $name string Required. Name or category of the action. Reports to New Relic One as the actionName attribute. Avoid using reserved NRQL words when you name the attribute or value. $attributes JSON object Optional. JSON object with one or more key/value pairs. For example: {key:\"value\"}. The key will report to New Relic One as its own PageAction attribute with the specified values. Avoid using reserved NRQL words when you name the attribute/value. Examples Record link clicks (JavaScript) This example records a PageAction event whenever a user selects the Try Me link. The event is recorded with an actionName of clickedTryMe: < a href=\"/demo\" id=\"try-me\" >Try Me!< /a> <script> document.getElementById('try-me').addEventListener('click',function (e) { newrelic.addPageAction('clickedTryMe'); }) </script> Copy You can then query the number of times the Try Me button was clicked with the following NRQL query: SELECT count(*) FROM PageAction WHERE actionName='clickedTryMe' SINCE 1 hour ago Copy Record link clicks (jQuery) This example sends a PageAction event when a user clicks on an element with the class copy-text. The actionName is copy-text-button and the value is reported as another attribute called Result that corresponds to methods named success and error that handle the outcome. $('.copy-text').click(function (){ var clipboard = new Clipboard ('.copy-text'); clipboard.on('success', function(event) { // Do stuff // Report data to New Relic One if (typeof newrelic == 'object') { newrelic.addPageAction('copy-text-button', {result: 'success'}); } }); clipboard.on('error', function(event) { // Do stuff // Report data to New Relic One if (typeof newrelic == 'object') { newrelic.addPageAction('copy-text-button', {result: 'error'}); } }); }); Copy Then in the query builder, you can create a pie chart to see the breakdown of how many button clicks resulted in success versus error over the past 30 days: SELECT count(*) AS 'Clicks' FROM PageAction WHERE actionName = 'copy-text-button' FACET result SINCE 30 days ago Copy Or you can create a query to see what pages have the most copy button clicks in the last 30 days: SELECT count(*) AS 'Clicks' FROM PageAction WHERE actionName = 'copy-text-button' FACET currentUrl SINCE 30 days ago Copy Capture form input This example captures user input (email addresses) from a form called Signup. The event is recorded with an actionName of userSignup: <form action=\"/signup\" id=\"myform\"> <input id=\"email\" name=\"email\"> <input type=\"submit\" value=\"Signup\"> </form> <script type=\"text/javascript\"> document.getElementById('myform').addEventListener('submit', function (e) { var email = e.target.elements['email'].value; newrelic.addPageAction('userSignup', {email: email}); }) </script> Copy You can then see the emails that you gathered with the following NRQL query: SELECT uniques(email) FROM PageAction WHERE actionName='userSignup' SINCE 1 hour ago Copy",

Requirements Agent version nr-593 or higher. Description This API call sends a Browser PageAction event with your user-defined name and optional attributes to dashboards, along with several default attributes. This is useful to track any event that is not already tracked automatically by the Browser agent, such as clicking a Subscribe button or accessing a tutorial. PageAction events are sent to New Relic One every 30 seconds, with a maximum of 120 events per 30-second harvest cycle, per browser. After the 120-event limit is reached, additional events are not captured for that harvest cycle. Parameters Parameter Description $name string Required. Name or category of the action. Reports to New Relic One as the actionName attribute. Avoid using reserved NRQL words when you name the attribute or value. $attributes JSON object Optional. JSON object with one or more key/value pairs. For example: {key:\"value\"}. The key will report to New Relic One as its own PageAction attribute with the specified values. Avoid using reserved NRQL words when you name the attribute/value. Examples Record link clicks (JavaScript) This example records a PageAction event whenever a user selects the Try Me link. The event is recorded with an actionName of clickedTryMe: < a href=\"/demo\" id=\"try-me\" >Try Me!< /a> <script> document.getElementById('try-me').addEventListener('click',function (e) { newrelic.addPageAction('clickedTryMe'); }) </script> Copy You can then query the number of times the Try Me button was clicked with the following NRQL query: SELECT count(*) FROM PageAction WHERE actionName='clickedTryMe' SINCE 1 hour ago Copy Record link clicks (jQuery) This example sends a PageAction event when a user clicks on an element with the class copy-text. The actionName is copy-text-button and the value is reported as another attribute called Result that corresponds to methods named success and error that handle the outcome. $('.copy-text').click(function (){ var clipboard = new Clipboard ('.copy-text'); clipboard.on('success', function(event) { // Do stuff // Report data to New Relic One if (typeof newrelic == 'object') { newrelic.addPageAction('copy-text-button', {result: 'success'}); } }); clipboard.on('error', function(event) { // Do stuff // Report data to New Relic One if (typeof newrelic == 'object') { newrelic.addPageAction('copy-text-button', {result: 'error'}); } }); }); Copy Then in the query builder, you can create a pie chart to see the breakdown of how many button clicks resulted in success versus error over the past 30 days: SELECT count(*) AS 'Clicks' FROM PageAction WHERE actionName = 'copy-text-button' FACET result SINCE 30 days ago Copy Or you can create a query to see what pages have the most copy button clicks in the last 30 days: SELECT count(*) AS 'Clicks' FROM PageAction WHERE actionName = 'copy-text-button' FACET currentUrl SINCE 30 days ago Copy Capture form input This example captures user input (email addresses) from a form called Signup. The event is recorded with an actionName of userSignup: <form action=\"/signup\" id=\"myform\"> <input id=\"email\" name=\"email\"> <input type=\"submit\" value=\"Signup\"> </form> <script type=\"text/javascript\"> document.getElementById('myform').addEventListener('submit', function (e) { var email = e.target.elements['email'].value; newrelic.addPageAction('userSignup', {email: email}); }) </script> Copy You can then see the emails that you gathered with the following NRQL query: SELECT uniques(email) FROM PageAction WHERE actionName='userSignup' SINCE 1 hour ago Copy",

Each time this method is called for the same BrowserInteraction, a new object is created, but it still references the same interaction. Examples SPA API methods can be used on newrelic.interaction(). The methods can also be used on a handle you assign with a variable. For example: myInteraction = newrelic.interaction() myInteraction.save() Copy The named handle can be saved and used from outside an interaction, but methods will have no effect after the interaction has ended.",

Requirements Agent version nr-593 or higher. Description This API call sends a Browser PageAction event with your user-defined name and optional attributes to dashboards, along with several default attributes. This is useful to track any event that is not already tracked automatically by the Browser agent, such as clicking a Subscribe button or accessing a tutorial. PageAction events are sent to New Relic One every 30 seconds, with a maximum of 120 events per 30-second harvest cycle, per browser. After the 120-event limit is reached, additional events are not captured for that harvest cycle. Parameters Parameter Description $name string Required. Name or category of the action. Reports to New Relic One as the actionName attribute. Avoid using reserved NRQL words when you name the attribute or value. $attributes JSON object Optional. JSON object with one or more key/value pairs. For example: {key:\"value\"}. The key will report to New Relic One as its own PageAction attribute with the specified values. Avoid using reserved NRQL words when you name the attribute/value. Examples Record link clicks (JavaScript) This example records a PageAction event whenever a user selects the Try Me link. The event is recorded with an actionName of clickedTryMe: < a href=\"/demo\" id=\"try-me\" >Try Me!< /a> <script> document.getElementById('try-me').addEventListener('click',function (e) { newrelic.addPageAction('clickedTryMe'); }) </script> Copy You can then query the number of times the Try Me button was clicked with the following NRQL query: SELECT count(*) FROM PageAction WHERE actionName='clickedTryMe' SINCE 1 hour ago Copy Record link clicks (jQuery) This example sends a PageAction event when a user clicks on an element with the class copy-text. The actionName is copy-text-button and the value is reported as another attribute called Result that corresponds to methods named success and error that handle the outcome. $('.copy-text').click(function (){ var clipboard = new Clipboard ('.copy-text'); clipboard.on('success', function(event) { // Do stuff // Report data to New Relic One if (typeof newrelic == 'object') { newrelic.addPageAction('copy-text-button', {result: 'success'}); } }); clipboard.on('error', function(event) { // Do stuff // Report data to New Relic One if (typeof newrelic == 'object') { newrelic.addPageAction('copy-text-button', {result: 'error'}); } }); }); Copy Then in the query builder, you can create a pie chart to see the breakdown of how many button clicks resulted in success versus error over the past 30 days: SELECT count(*) AS 'Clicks' FROM PageAction WHERE actionName = 'copy-text-button' FACET result SINCE 30 days ago Copy Or you can create a query to see what pages have the most copy button clicks in the last 30 days: SELECT count(*) AS 'Clicks' FROM PageAction WHERE actionName = 'copy-text-button' FACET currentUrl SINCE 30 days ago Copy Capture form input This example captures user input (email addresses) from a form called Signup.

Requirements Agent version nr-593 or higher. Description The Browser API call adds a user-defined attribute name and value to subsequent events on the page. Make this call before the window load event fires (when that data is transmitted) in order for the attributes to be included in the PageView event. Once an attribute is set, New Relic One records it with all PageAction events until the page is reloaded or the attribute is manually unset. If you are using SPA monitoring with a compatible agent version, attributes set with this call will also be included in newrelic.interaction events. However, attributes set using the SPA API will take precedence over these attributes. Errors for custom attributes will be included in events on the JS Errors page. To view or log errors for a custom attribute via API, use the Browser API's noticeError call. Parameters Parameter Description $name string Required. Name of the attribute. Appears as column in the PageView event. It will also appear as a column in the PageAction event if you are using it. Avoid using reserved NRQL words when you name the attribute/value. $value string OR integer Required. Value of the attribute. Appears as the value in the named attribute column in the PageView event. It will appear as a column in the PageAction event if you are using it. Custom attribute values cannot be complex objects, only simple types such as Strings and Integers. Avoid using reserved NRQL words when you name the attribute/value.

Requirements Agent version nr-593 or higher. Description This API call sends a Browser PageAction event with your user-defined name and optional attributes to dashboards, along with several default attributes. This is useful to track any event that is not already tracked automatically by the Browser agent, such as clicking a Subscribe button or accessing a tutorial. PageAction events are sent to New Relic One every 30 seconds, with a maximum of 120 events per 30-second harvest cycle, per browser. After the 120-event limit is reached, additional events are not captured for that harvest cycle. Parameters Parameter Description $name string Required. Name or category of the action. Reports to New Relic One as the actionName attribute. Avoid using reserved NRQL words when you name the attribute or value. $attributes JSON object Optional. JSON object with one or more key/value pairs. For example: {key:\"value\"}. The key will report to New Relic One as its own PageAction attribute with the specified values. Avoid using reserved NRQL words when you name the attribute/value. Examples Record link clicks (JavaScript) This example records a PageAction event whenever a user selects the Try Me link. The event is recorded with an actionName of clickedTryMe: < a href=\"/demo\" id=\"try-me\" >Try Me!< /a> <script> document.getElementById('try-me').addEventListener('click',function (e) { newrelic.addPageAction('clickedTryMe'); }) </script> Copy You can then query the number of times the Try Me button was clicked with the following NRQL query: SELECT count(*) FROM PageAction WHERE actionName='clickedTryMe' SINCE 1 hour ago Copy Record link clicks (jQuery) This example sends a PageAction event when a user clicks on an element with the class copy-text. The actionName is copy-text-button and the value is reported as another attribute called Result that corresponds to methods named success and error that handle the outcome. $('.copy-text').click(function (){ var clipboard = new Clipboard ('.copy-text'); clipboard.on('success', function(event) { // Do stuff // Report data to New Relic One if (typeof newrelic == 'object') { newrelic.addPageAction('copy-text-button', {result: 'success'}); } }); clipboard.on('error', function(event) { // Do stuff // Report data to New Relic One if (typeof newrelic == 'object') { newrelic.addPageAction('copy-text-button', {result: 'error'}); } }); }); Copy Then in the query builder, you can create a pie chart to see the breakdown of how many button clicks resulted in success versus error over the past 30 days: SELECT count(*) AS 'Clicks' FROM PageAction WHERE actionName = 'copy-text-button' FACET result SINCE 30 days ago Copy Or you can create a query to see what pages have the most copy button clicks in the last 30 days: SELECT count(*) AS 'Clicks' FROM PageAction WHERE actionName = 'copy-text-button' FACET currentUrl SINCE 30 days ago Copy Capture form input This example captures user input (email addresses) from a form called Signup. The event is recorded with an actionName of userSignup: <form action=\"/signup\" id=\"myform\"> <input id=\"email\" name=\"email\"> <input type=\"submit\" value=\"Signup\"> </form> <script type=\"text/javascript\"> document.getElementById('myform').addEventListener('submit', function (e) { var email = e.target.elements['email'].value; newrelic.addPageAction('userSignup', {email: email}); }) </script> Copy You can then see the emails that you gathered with the following NRQL query: SELECT uniques(email) FROM PageAction WHERE actionName='userSignup' SINCE 1 hour ago Copy",

Requirements Agent version nr-593 or higher. Description The Browser API call adds a user-defined attribute name and value to subsequent events on the page. Make this call before the window load event fires (when that data is transmitted) in order for the attributes to be included in the PageView event. Once an attribute is set, New Relic One records it with all PageAction events until the page is reloaded or the attribute is manually unset. If you are using SPA monitoring with a compatible agent version, attributes set with this call will also be included in newrelic.interaction events. However, attributes set using the SPA API will take precedence over these attributes. Errors for custom attributes will be included in events on the JS Errors page. To view or log errors for a custom attribute via API, use the Browser API's noticeError call. Parameters Parameter Description $name string Required. Name of the attribute. Appears as column in the PageView event. It will also appear as a column in the PageAction event if you are using it. Avoid using reserved NRQL words when you name the attribute/value. $value string OR integer Required. Value of the attribute. Appears as the value in the named attribute column in the PageView event.

Requirements Agent version nr-593 or higher. Description This API call sends a Browser PageAction event with your user-defined name and optional attributes to dashboards, along with several default attributes. This is useful to track any event that is not already tracked automatically by the Browser agent, such as clicking a Subscribe button or accessing a tutorial. PageAction events are sent to New Relic One every 30 seconds, with a maximum of 120 events per 30-second harvest cycle, per browser. After the 120-event limit is reached, additional events are not captured for that harvest cycle. Parameters Parameter Description $name string Required. Name or category of the action. Reports to New Relic One as the actionName attribute. Avoid using reserved NRQL words when you name the attribute or value. $attributes JSON object Optional. JSON object with one or more key/value pairs. For example: {key:\"value\"}. The key will report to New Relic One as its own PageAction attribute with the specified values. Avoid using reserved NRQL words when you name the attribute/value. Examples Record link clicks (JavaScript) This example records a PageAction event whenever a user selects the Try Me link. The event is recorded with an actionName of clickedTryMe: < a href=\"/demo\" id=\"try-me\" >Try Me!< /a> <script> document.getElementById('try-me').addEventListener('click',function (e) { newrelic.addPageAction('clickedTryMe'); }) </script> Copy You can then query the number of times the Try Me button was clicked with the following NRQL query: SELECT count(*) FROM PageAction WHERE actionName='clickedTryMe' SINCE 1 hour ago Copy Record link clicks (jQuery) This example sends a PageAction event when a user clicks on an element with the class copy-text. The actionName is copy-text-button and the value is reported as another attribute called Result that corresponds to methods named success and error that handle the outcome. $('.copy-text').click(function (){ var clipboard = new Clipboard ('.copy-text'); clipboard.on('success', function(event) { // Do stuff // Report data to New Relic One if (typeof newrelic == 'object') { newrelic.addPageAction('copy-text-button', {result: 'success'}); } }); clipboard.on('error', function(event) { // Do stuff // Report data to New Relic One if (typeof newrelic == 'object') { newrelic.addPageAction('copy-text-button', {result: 'error'}); } }); }); Copy Then in the query builder, you can create a pie chart to see the breakdown of how many button clicks resulted in success versus error over the past 30 days: SELECT count(*) AS 'Clicks' FROM PageAction WHERE actionName = 'copy-text-button' FACET result SINCE 30 days ago Copy Or you can create a query to see what pages have the most copy button clicks in the last 30 days: SELECT count(*) AS 'Clicks' FROM PageAction WHERE actionName = 'copy-text-button' FACET currentUrl SINCE 30 days ago Copy Capture form input This example captures user input (email addresses) from a form called Signup. The event is recorded with an actionName of userSignup: <form action=\"/signup\" id=\"myform\"> <input id=\"email\" name=\"email\"> <input type=\"submit\" value=\"Signup\"> </form> <script type=\"text/javascript\"> document.getElementById('myform').addEventListener('submit', function (e) { var email = e.target.elements['email'].value; newrelic.addPageAction('userSignup', {email: email}); }) </script> Copy You can then see the emails that you gathered with the following NRQL query: SELECT uniques(email) FROM PageAction WHERE actionName='userSignup' SINCE 1 hour ago Copy",

Requirements Agent version nr-593 or higher. Description This API call sends a Browser PageAction event with your user-defined name and optional attributes to dashboards, along with several default attributes. This is useful to track any event that is not already tracked automatically by the Browser agent, such as clicking a Subscribe button or accessing a tutorial. PageAction events are sent to New Relic One every 30 seconds, with a maximum of 120 events per 30-second harvest cycle, per browser. After the 120-event limit is reached, additional events are not captured for that harvest cycle. Parameters Parameter Description $name string Required. Name or category of the action. Reports to New Relic One as the actionName attribute. Avoid using reserved NRQL words when you name the attribute or value. $attributes JSON object Optional. JSON object with one or more key/value pairs. For example: {key:\"value\"}. The key will report to New Relic One as its own PageAction attribute with the specified values. Avoid using reserved NRQL words when you name the attribute/value. Examples Record link clicks (JavaScript) This example records a PageAction event whenever a user selects the Try Me link. The event is recorded with an actionName of clickedTryMe: < a href=\"/demo\" id=\"try-me\" >Try Me!< /a> <script> document.getElementById('try-me').addEventListener('click',function (e) { newrelic.addPageAction('clickedTryMe'); }) </script> Copy You can then query the number of times the Try Me button was clicked with the following NRQL query: SELECT count(*) FROM PageAction WHERE actionName='clickedTryMe' SINCE 1 hour ago Copy Record link clicks (jQuery) This example sends a PageAction event when a user clicks on an element with the class copy-text. The actionName is copy-text-button and the value is reported as another attribute called Result that corresponds to methods named success and error that handle the outcome. $('.copy-text').click(function (){ var clipboard = new Clipboard ('.copy-text'); clipboard.on('success', function(event) { // Do stuff // Report data to New Relic One if (typeof newrelic == 'object') { newrelic.addPageAction('copy-text-button', {result: 'success'}); } }); clipboard.on('error', function(event) { // Do stuff // Report data to New Relic One if (typeof newrelic == 'object') { newrelic.addPageAction('copy-text-button', {result: 'error'}); } }); }); Copy Then in the query builder, you can create a pie chart to see the breakdown of how many button clicks resulted in success versus error over the past 30 days: SELECT count(*) AS 'Clicks' FROM PageAction WHERE actionName = 'copy-text-button' FACET result SINCE 30 days ago Copy Or you can create a query to see what pages have the most copy button clicks in the last 30 days: SELECT count(*) AS 'Clicks' FROM PageAction WHERE actionName = 'copy-text-button' FACET currentUrl SINCE 30 days ago Copy Capture form input This example captures user input (email addresses) from a form called Signup. The event is recorded with an actionName of userSignup: <form action=\"/signup\" id=\"myform\"> <input id=\"email\" name=\"email\"> <input type=\"submit\" value=\"Signup\"> </form> <script type=\"text/javascript\"> document.getElementById('myform').addEventListener('submit', function (e) { var email = e.target.elements['email'].value; newrelic.addPageAction('userSignup', {email: email}); }) </script> Copy You can then see the emails that you gathered with the following NRQL query: SELECT uniques(email) FROM PageAction WHERE actionName='userSignup' SINCE 1 hour ago Copy",

The actionName is copy-text-button and the value is reported as another attribute called Result that corresponds to methods named success and error that handle the outcome. $('.copy-text').click(function (){ var clipboard = new Clipboard ('.copy-text'); clipboard.on('success', function(event) { // Do stuff // Report data to New Relic One if (typeof newrelic == 'object') { newrelic.addPageAction('copy-text-button', {result: 'success'}); } }); clipboard.on('error', function(event) { // Do stuff // Report data to New Relic One if (typeof newrelic == 'object') { newrelic.addPageAction('copy-text-button', {result: 'error'}); } }); }); Copy Then in the query builder, you can create a pie chart to see the breakdown of how many button clicks resulted in success versus error over the past 30 days: SELECT count(*) AS 'Clicks' FROM PageAction WHERE actionName = 'copy-text-button' FACET result SINCE 30 days ago Copy Or you can create a query to see what pages have the most copy button clicks in the last 30 days: SELECT count(*) AS 'Clicks' FROM PageAction WHERE actionName = 'copy-text-button' FACET currentUrl SINCE 30 days ago Copy Capture form input This example captures user input (email addresses) from a form called Signup. The event is recorded with an actionName of userSignup: <form action=\"/signup\" id=\"myform\"> <input id=\"email\" name=\"email\"> <input type=\"submit\" value=\"Signup\"> </form> <script type=\"text/javascript\"> document.getElementById('myform').addEventListener('submit', function (e) { var email = e.target.elements['email'].value; newrelic.addPageAction('userSignup', {email: email}); }) </script> Copy You can then see the emails that you gathered with the following NRQL query: SELECT uniques(email) FROM PageAction WHERE actionName='userSignup' SINCE 1 hour ago Copy",

The event is recorded with an actionName of userSignup: <form action=\"/signup\" id=\"myform\"> <input id=\"email\" name=\"email\"> <input type=\"submit\" value=\"Signup\"> </form> <script type=\"text/javascript\"> document.getElementById('myform').addEventListener('submit', function (e) { var email = e.target.elements['email'].value; newrelic.addPageAction('userSignup', {email: email}); }) </script> Copy You can then see the emails that you gathered with the following NRQL query: SELECT uniques(email) FROM PageAction WHERE actionName='userSignup' SINCE 1 hour ago Copy",

      "body": "New Relic Browser's Filterable Geography page provides a world view with color-coded performance information about cities, regions, and countries anywhere around the world. You can filter and drill down into detailed information, or use your mouse to select or zoom in and out of any location on the map. The enhanced attributes provide deep visibility not only about your end users' experience with page load timing, but also with network performance anywhere around the world. This level of visual detail is especially useful for professionals in IT and Operations to make business decisions about peering agreements and CDN usage. Contents Requirements Your New Relic Browser subscription level and your time picker settings determine what data you can view: Pro or higher: As of January 2016, the Filterable Geography feature automatically appears in your New Relic Browser user interface. No special setup is required. You can view up to eight days of data. Your application must be enabled to send PageView data to New Relic Insights in order to use Filterable Geography. Lite: The Filterable Geography feature appears in your New Relic Browser's UI menu but currently is not available for use. Any subscription level: If you need to use New Relic Browser's legacy Geography feature, you can still view it from your selected browser app. Factors affecting collected data To capture page load timing information, New Relic Browser uses the Navigation Timing API, which most (but not all) browsers support. If the browsers do not support the Navigation Timing API, then New Relic Browser charts and data points can only show the network data they receive for DNS lookup, connection, secure handshake, etc. This may not be 100% of the app's overall traffic. Also, firewalls may have an impact on the geographical data collected about your end users. View performance data by location one.newrelic.com > Browser > (select an app) > Browser app > Filterable Geography: Here is an example of the map before drilling down into detailed information about London, England. To view or sort the performance information by location: Go to one.newrelic.com > Browser > (select an app) > Filterable Geography. Select the type of performance data to view from the dropdown, or use the default Average page load time. To drill down to a specific area, mouse over or select any area on the geographical map, or select any of the ten worst performing locations from the list to the right of the map. To view specific performance metrics, select any of the attributes below the funnel icon. To view comparison data, select the Page load performance or Historical performance chart below the selected location's geographical map. Use map functions Use any of New Relic's standard user interface functions and page functions to drill down into detailed information. Here is a summary of additional options with the Filterable Geography page. If you want to... Do this... Change what kind of performance data appears Select your choice from the dropdown. Default performance indicator is Average page load time. The map's legend lists the ten best or worst performing areas (depending on the selected performance indicator) for the selected time period. For example: If you select Count, the map's legend shows the top ten locations with the highest number of page loads, as well as the average page load time for each. If you select Connection setup, New Relic Browser first filters out areas with low throughput. Then the map's legend shows the top ten locations where average connection time is the slowest, as well as the average page load time and count for each. View summary performance information about a specific location Mouse over any colored area on the map, select a location from the list, or zoom in and out of any area on the map. View detailed data for a location Select any area of the map. For example: If you select Canada, the map and legend show color-coded performance data for each province and territory. The list to the right of the map shows the top ten worst performing areas. If you select a specific province or territory, the map shows color-coded performance data for the top ten cities. The map includes circled locations which you can mouse over or select to view detailed information. In addition, the Page load performance and Historical performance charts below the map automatically update with each location you select. Hide the list of available attributes Select the funnel icon. Return to a larger world view Select another location on the map, or clear the filter labels above the map. Tip To return to the original map view of the world, select any area on an ocean. Examine heat map details one.newrelic.com > Browser > (select an app) > Browser app > Filterable Geography: Here is an example of the map as you use filter and zoom tools to drill down into detailed information about London, England. Athough overall throughput for the area is good (green), the nearby yellow areas, and the smaller red and orange circles indicate nearby cities with varying levels of throughput problems, not the size of those cities. The Filterable Geography heat map identifies performance quality with color and with the size of circles. Heat map Description Color scale Performance quality ranges from green (the best) to yellow, orange, and then red (the worst). When selecting indicators of usage rather than performance, the heat map shows shades of purple, with the darkest shades indicating the highest usage. The color scale adapts to your app's specific performance. Each area is a percentile range. To view the range for each color segment, mouse over the heat map's legend. Thresholds Different thresholds are dynamically applied to the colors based on the type of performance indicator you select from the dropdown and the maximum value your app has reported. For example, green for Average page load time may indicate 0 to 3.3 seconds, while green for Average network time may indicate 0 to 256 milliseconds. Circles The map's colored circles help you identify areas with performance problems at a glance. Each circle's radius is based on throughput reported for the city it represents, not the size of the city itself. You may see many circles overlapping each other. This usually indicates a grouping of metropolitan areas which represent a geographic area of heavy traffic. Filter performance metrics The Filter feature allows you to select and group data by attributes in various categories, including: Page view Geography Browser Identity Custom The filtered results appear on the geographical map, where you can use any of the standard map functions to explore additional details. Here are some examples. Unsatisfactory network performance by ASN In this example, your organization is preparing to renew a peering agreement with the owner of an autonomous system, called \"My-ASN.\" You are concerned that continued outages and other connection issues are affecting customer satisfaction with your site, and you want to compare its performance with other ASNs. You have a New Relic Browser Pro account. Go to one.newrelic.com > Browser > (select an app) > Filterable Geography. From the performance type dropdown, select Connection setup. Select the funnel icon. To view the specific ASN's performance: From the search window, type My-ASN, and then select this name from the Filter by results. OR To compare performance with other ASNs: From Geography attributes > ASN organizations, review the performance data for each organization on the list, and then select Back to groupings list. To close the filter list, select the funnel icon. Follow standard procedures to use the map functions and view comparative performance details. To clear the filter, select the attribute name. Page rendering performance during sales promotion In this example, your organization has a special three-day sales promotion for an upcoming holiday. Your holiday-merchandise page has undergone major changes, including dozens of new images. You want to look for performance problems with page rendering on Android mobile devices during this sales period. You have a New Relic Browser Pro account. Go to one.newrelic.com > Browser > (select an app) > Filterable Geography. Use the time picker to change the date range to the promotion period. From the performance type dropdown, select Page rendering. Select the funnel icon. From Page view attributes > Page Url, select your site's holiday-merchandise page, and then select Back to groupings list. From Browser attributes > User agent OS, select Android, and then select Back to groupings list. To close the filter list, select the funnel icon. Follow standard procedures to use the map functions and view comparative performance details. To clear the filters, select their attribute names. View comparative performance details Charts on the Page load performance and Historical performance tabs automatically refresh with comparative performance details for the selected location. one.newrelic.com > Browser > (select an app) > Browser app > Filterable Geography: Charts on the Page load performance and Historical performance tabs automatically refresh with details for the selected location. The Page load performance tab shows two charts. The Average page load time chart includes: Average page load time for each segment of the page load timing process in seconds Request queuing information (the time after a request enters your production systems and before it reaches your application) if applicable The Average network time chart shows key elements, including how long it takes for DNS lookup, connection establishment, and secure handshake, in seconds. Tip Sometimes areas on the charts may appear to be zero or near zero. This is because some apps use existing TCP connections, and they do not need to establish new connections. The Historical performance tab shows comparison data for the selected time period, yesterday, and last week for the selected location. This includes: Average response time Throughput in pages per minute (ppm) Available metrics You can filter and group geographical performance data in New Relic Browser and in New Relic Insights. Available metrics include: Performance Metrics Webpage Page load time Throughput (pages per minute or ppm) Network time Connection time Secure connection time Network Autonomous system number and name (ASN) via IP mapping SSL negotiation timing DNS timing Time to first byte ASN latitude and longitude for Internet service providers (ISPs) To ensure end user security, New Relic Browser collects GeoIP information for the end user's ISP. New Relic Browser does not collect GeoIP information for the specific end user. For example, if an end user in Portland, Oregon uses an ISP located in Beaverton, Oregon, New Relic Browser collects the GeoIP information for the ISP in Beaverton. User agents Operating systems Browser names or types Browser versions Device types Performance and usage ranges The color-coded legend shows performance and usage as percentile ranges. Performance color ranges Percentile colors for performance range from green (the best) to red (the worst). Performance percentile ranges (best to worst) Green Yellow Orange Red Back-end duration 0-74.9 75-86.9 87-94.9 95+ Connection setup duration 0-96.9 97-97.9 98-98.9 99+ DNS lookup duration 0-96.9 97-97.9 98-98.9 99+ DOM processing duration 0-74.9 75-86.9 87-94.9 95+ Network duration 0-74.9 75-86.9 87-94.9 95+ Page load duration 0-74.9 75-86.9 87-94.9 95+ Page rendering duration 0-74.9 75-86.9 87-94.9 95+ Queue duration 0-74.9 75-86.9 87-94.9 95+ Secure handshake duration 0-96.9 97-97.9 98-98.9 99+ Web app duration 0-74.9 75-86.9 87-94.9 95+ Usage color ranges Percentile colors for usage counts appear as shades of purple, from lightest (lowest usage) to darkest (highest usage).

Page load timing, individual asset loads, user interactions, AJAX requests, callbacks, errors, and other events appear in an interactive timeline which includes a detailed waterfall visualization, a heat map overview, and highlighted metrics and problems related to that session. Identify problems and solutions Session traces help you understand: How users experience your page load, including time to DOM load, time waiting for AJAX requests to complete, and the user's interactions with the page How the New Relic metrics reflect your end users' experiences What is the sequence of JavaScript and browser events, which take longer than others, and when each event occurs Where bottlenecks occur, and what may be causing them Why one page load may be slower than others, by providing the context for individual events during a session By connecting performance to user experience and interactions to performance, this detailed and intuitive visualization of all events in the user's session can help pinpoint problem areas and easily identify solutions. Requirements To use Browser monitoring's session traces feature, make sure you meet these requirements: Your agent version must support Browser monitoring. If you're using multiple names for an app, session traces will only report to the most specific application. For accounts older than October 2014, you must enable Browser monitoring and the enhanced Pro features. Browser randomly captures traces only from browsers that support the Resource Timing API. Select a session trace The Session traces index lists the most recent traces based on the time picker selection for the selected app. Session traces are randomly sampled and stored at a rate of 90/hour. You can page through up to 500 traces at a time. Additionally, you can sort and search the list by attributes, including: Full URL, with query string parameters removed Browser type Started at date/time Page load time one.newrelic.com > Browser > (select an app) > Session traces: You can select a session trace from the Browser index. You can also select a session trace directly from the Browser Summary, Page views, JS errors, and AJAX pages. To select a specific session trace: Go to one.newrelic.com and click Browser > (select an app) > Session traces. To locate a session trace from a different date or time period, use the time picker. To limit the index to a specific type of trace, use the search window. To view detailed information, select the session trace's link. Tip You can also select a session trace directly from the Browser Summary, Page views, JS errors and AJAX pages. View session trace details The Session trace details page provides summary information about the trace, a heat map with timing details, and a waterfall of events that you can explore. The color-coded legend identifies the page load events during the webpage's life cycle. For apps that have been deployed using the copy/paste method, Browser monitoring includes web app and queue time in Network time as part of the page load timing process. This is because Browser relies on the server-side agent to pass the application values to the Browser agent through auto-injection. You can view detailed information about how this \"back end\" time breaks down from the browser's point of view. The session traces report on all the network related events available, so you can see on a case-by-case basis how the browser spends time on DNS lookups and other network events. one.newrelic.com > Browser > (select an app) > Session traces > (select a trace): Use Browser's session trace details to examine events and identify problems during the end user's webpage session.

Share the session trace information Create a permalink to paste into a form, ticket, email, etc. Session segment definitions Important session trace measurements are displayed in the upper right corner of the Session traces page. The first four measurements represent how long into a session that the segment ended. For example, if Page Load is 0.202s, that means that the page load event completed 0.202 seconds after the request began. Session segment Description Backend The time from when the request began to when backend activity finished and DOM loading began. DOM processing The time from when the request began to when DOM processing finished. Page load The time from when the request began to when the page load event fired. Waiting on AJAX The time from when the request began to when AJAX activity ended. First interaction The time from when the request began to when the first user activity, like a mouse click or a scroll, was recorded. Duration The total duration of the session. Slow JavaScript execution and repainting Session traces help you identify callbacks in your JavaScript code that execute slowly and block the execution of subsequent calls on the browser's main thread. These calls should execute quickly in order to allow the browser to quickly repaint the page in response to user actions. Session traces highlight any callbacks longer than 33ms. If called in rapid succession (such as inside a requestAnimationFrame loop), callbacks longer than 33ms reduce the frame rate below 30 frames per second. This speed seems sluggish to users.",

View error profiles To view Browser monitoring error profiles: Go to one.newrelic.com and click Browser > (select an app) > JS errors. To see error profile details: At the bottom of the JS errors UI page, select an error profile to expand it. What are error profiles? In Browser monitoring, an error profile is a potentially meaningful correlation New Relic has found between your JavaScript error attribute values when compared to normal PageView events. These correlations help you investigate the causes and contributing factors behind your errors. The screenshot below shows an example of an error profile. This error profile shows that the distribution of the userAgentOS attribute values varies significantly when JS error events are compared to normal (non-error) page view events. To investigate further, you could use the filter to display only Windows errors and see if there are other correlations. You can also filter the data used to generate error profiles to help you narrow down potential causes. For an analysis of a specific error profile, see the example error profile explanation. Filter error profile data To further filter the data used to generate error profiles and their comparison page views, use these JS errors page features: Time picker: select a time range used to generate the data. Filter: use the filter to display only error profiles and page views that have the attribute values you choose. You can select multiple attribute values. Example error profile explanation To help you better understand your own error profile data, this is an explanation of an example error profile's data. This error profile example has had a filter of userAgentName = Chrome applied, so it is only showing error data from Chrome browsers. This example profile has had a filter applied so that it is only showing error data from Chrome browsers. Column explanations: The first column is the attribute column. It shows the attribute values with the most deviation when compared to non-error page views. Less significant attribute values are aggregated in the Other category. In this example, the Chrome versions 36, 64, and 65 make up 100% of the errors for Chrome users. The JS errors column shows what percentage of JavaScriptError events have the attribute values from the first column. This column adds up to 100%, representing all errors from the chosen time range and filter set. In this example, a large percentage of Chrome errors are coming from Chrome version 36. If we wanted to investigate this further, we could filter to only show version 36 data. The Page views column shows what percentage of PageView events have the attribute values from the first column. In this example, less than 1% of Chrome users use Chrome version 36, but 55% of errors are generated by users with that version. The Difference column shows you the difference in percentage between the JS errors column and the Page views column. In this example, the 54% indicates that attribute is 54 percentage points higher for error events than for page views.",

This document contains: Benefits of this feature Requirements Enable distributed tracing Enable cross-origin resource sharing (CORS) Find and query data Troubleshooting Tip Browser data is available in standard distributed tracing only, not Infinite Tracing. Benefits of browser data in distributed tracing By enabling New Relic to report browser data to distributed tracing, you can see the connection between front-end activity and back-end activity. You can see across a full transaction, from time spent by an end user in the web browser, to network activity, to associated back-end services. Benefits of this feature: Quickly spot latencies, errors, and anomalies in the browser or network Resolve customer-facing problems more quickly All the benefits of distributed tracing applied to your end-user monitoring Requirements and compatibility This feature reports AJAX requests (Fetch and XHR) that occur during a browser interaction. By default, only single-origin requests are monitored unless cross-origin resource sharing is enabled. Make sure you have the minimum versions for your Browser, APM, and APM agents: Browser Pro + SPA, with distributed tracing enabled Browser agent version 1153 or higher Browser agent version 1158 or higher (required for cross-origin resource sharing) Browser agent version 1173 or higher (required for w3c trace context support) APM agent version: C SDK 1.3 or higher Java 5.9.0 or higher PHP 9.4.0 or higher Other APM agent version requirements Enable distributed tracing To enable distributed tracing for Browser monitoring: Make sure you meet requirements, including having: Full-Stack Observability Browser Pro with SPA enabled Go to one.newrelic.com, and click Browser > (select an app) > Settings > Application settings. Turn on the Distributed tracing toggle. By default, for agent version 1173 and above, the newrelic, traceparent, and tracestate headers will be added to all same-origin AJAX requests. Optional: If all of your services are configured to use the w3c trace context headers, you can choose to exclude the newrelic, traceparent, and tracestate headers from requests. Optional: Enable cross-origin resource sharing. Redeploy the Browser agent (either restarting the associated APM agent or updating the copy/paste Browser installation). Enable cross-origin resource sharing (CORS) If you have AJAX requests that need resources from different origins, you can enable cross-origin resource sharing (CORS). By default, distributed tracing for cross-origin requests is not enabled because of browser CORS security restrictions: Distributed tracing is implemented by adding a custom HTTP headers (newrelic, traceparent, and tracestate) to outgoing AJAX requests, and browsers typically do not allow custom headers on cross-origin requests. With the release of agent version 1173, we now support the w3c trace context headers (traceparent and tracestate) so these should also be allowed in your configuration. There are two separate configurations required to enable cross-origin distributed tracing: Configure the service on the different origin to accept the newrelic custom header Configure Browser monitoring to include the target origin in distributed tracing Our step-by-step instructions provide key concepts and steps to enable this feature, but if you need more background about how cross-origin resource sharing works, we recommend this Mozilla developer document. Risks and mitigations Caution Cross-origin resource sharing can expose you to a high level of risk if the services on the different origins are not configured correctly. The AJAX requests will likely return an error, resulting in a variety of failures, including: Resources failing to load (for example, images and key content) Login failures Entire site outages (depending on type of requests enabled) By enabling this cross-origin resource sharing feature, you are acknowledging the following: You understand that this feature is optional and not mandatory. You understand the steps you need to take in order to enable this feature for your services and your domains. You understand that if you do not properly configure your services prior to deployment (including but not limited to configuring your services on your domains to accept custom headers) portions or all of your website will likely malfunction. You understand that New Relic is neither responsible nor liable for errors or issues related to your misconfiguration of servers or services. You fully and solely accept the risks and wish to proceed. The best way to minimize your risk is to ensure you fully understand the process and to try it first in a test environment. Before reading the step-by-step instructions, it may help to first read this overview of the process: To use distributed tracing with cross-origin resources, you populate a list of approved cross-origin resources in New Relic, and then we automatically send the following custom headers to those resources: newrelic, traceparent, and tracestate. For this process to work, you must first ensure that someone has configured the services on the other origins to accept this custom header. Cross-origin resource sharing uses a variety of HTTP headers (both in the request and response). The header that specifically applies to New Relic is the Access-Control-Allow-Headers response header, which can include newrelic, traceparent, tracestate, or newrelic, traceparent, tracestate in its value depending on what tracing strategies you enabled in your APM-monitored application. You must configure your server to return this CORS header in its response. Example: Access-Control-Allow-Headers: newrelic, traceparent, tracestate Important New Relic cannot perform any validation to ensure the services on the other origins were configured correctly. If you're unsure about how to allow these headers, do not add cross-origin resources to the approved list in the New Relic UI. Enable cross-origin resource sharing Caution You should always try enabling CORS in a test environment before setting it up in production. To enable cross-origin resource sharing: Confirm that the services on the other origins are configured to accept the newrelic header using: Access-Control-Allow-Headers: newrelic, traceparent, tracestate (for details, see Risks and mitigations). Confirm that you meet the Browser monitoring requirements. Make sure you are in one.newrelic.com, and click Browser > (select an app) > Application settings. Turn on the Distributed tracing toggle if it's not already enabled. Turn on the Cross-origin resource sharing (CORS) toggle. Under Cross-origin resource sharing (CORS), add cross-origin resources to the approved list. Important Valid cross-origin resources must include: The prefix http:// or https:// The domain name The port number is not required unless it differs from the default for HTTP (port 80) or HTTPS (port 443). Select Save application settings to update the agent configuration. Redeploy the Browser agent (either restarting the associated APM agent or updating the copy/paste Browser installation). Find data Tips for finding and querying data: You can find end-user-originating traces in any New Relic One distributed tracing UI. In the distributed tracing UI, end-user spans are indicated with the icon. To see a span's attributes, select a span in the UI. Spans are reported as Span data, and can be queried in New Relic. Query tips: Query by browser app name by setting browserApp.name to the browser app name. Query for traces containing at least one browser app span with browserApp.name is not null. Query for traces containing at least one back-end app with appName is not null. Query for traces containing both browser and back-end spans by combining the two previous conditions. Troubleshooting If you don't see end-user spans, or are having other distributed tracing issues, see Troubleshooting.",

      "body": "New Relic Browser's Filterable Geography page provides a world view with color-coded performance information about cities, regions, and countries anywhere around the world. You can filter and drill down into detailed information, or use your mouse to select or zoom in and out of any location on the map. The enhanced attributes provide deep visibility not only about your end users' experience with page load timing, but also with network performance anywhere around the world. This level of visual detail is especially useful for professionals in IT and Operations to make business decisions about peering agreements and CDN usage. Contents Requirements Your New Relic Browser subscription level and your time picker settings determine what data you can view: Pro or higher: As of January 2016, the Filterable Geography feature automatically appears in your New Relic Browser user interface. No special setup is required. You can view up to eight days of data. Your application must be enabled to send PageView data to New Relic Insights in order to use Filterable Geography. Lite: The Filterable Geography feature appears in your New Relic Browser's UI menu but currently is not available for use. Any subscription level: If you need to use New Relic Browser's legacy Geography feature, you can still view it from your selected browser app. Factors affecting collected data To capture page load timing information, New Relic Browser uses the Navigation Timing API, which most (but not all) browsers support. If the browsers do not support the Navigation Timing API, then New Relic Browser charts and data points can only show the network data they receive for DNS lookup, connection, secure handshake, etc. This may not be 100% of the app's overall traffic. Also, firewalls may have an impact on the geographical data collected about your end users. View performance data by location one.newrelic.com > Browser > (select an app) > Browser app > Filterable Geography: Here is an example of the map before drilling down into detailed information about London, England. To view or sort the performance information by location: Go to one.newrelic.com > Browser > (select an app) > Filterable Geography. Select the type of performance data to view from the dropdown, or use the default Average page load time. To drill down to a specific area, mouse over or select any area on the geographical map, or select any of the ten worst performing locations from the list to the right of the map. To view specific performance metrics, select any of the attributes below the funnel icon. To view comparison data, select the Page load performance or Historical performance chart below the selected location's geographical map. Use map functions Use any of New Relic's standard user interface functions and page functions to drill down into detailed information. Here is a summary of additional options with the Filterable Geography page. If you want to... Do this... Change what kind of performance data appears Select your choice from the dropdown. Default performance indicator is Average page load time. The map's legend lists the ten best or worst performing areas (depending on the selected performance indicator) for the selected time period. For example: If you select Count, the map's legend shows the top ten locations with the highest number of page loads, as well as the average page load time for each. If you select Connection setup, New Relic Browser first filters out areas with low throughput. Then the map's legend shows the top ten locations where average connection time is the slowest, as well as the average page load time and count for each. View summary performance information about a specific location Mouse over any colored area on the map, select a location from the list, or zoom in and out of any area on the map. View detailed data for a location Select any area of the map. For example: If you select Canada, the map and legend show color-coded performance data for each province and territory. The list to the right of the map shows the top ten worst performing areas. If you select a specific province or territory, the map shows color-coded performance data for the top ten cities. The map includes circled locations which you can mouse over or select to view detailed information. In addition, the Page load performance and Historical performance charts below the map automatically update with each location you select. Hide the list of available attributes Select the funnel icon. Return to a larger world view Select another location on the map, or clear the filter labels above the map. Tip To return to the original map view of the world, select any area on an ocean. Examine heat map details one.newrelic.com > Browser > (select an app) > Browser app > Filterable Geography: Here is an example of the map as you use filter and zoom tools to drill down into detailed information about London, England. Athough overall throughput for the area is good (green), the nearby yellow areas, and the smaller red and orange circles indicate nearby cities with varying levels of throughput problems, not the size of those cities. The Filterable Geography heat map identifies performance quality with color and with the size of circles. Heat map Description Color scale Performance quality ranges from green (the best) to yellow, orange, and then red (the worst). When selecting indicators of usage rather than performance, the heat map shows shades of purple, with the darkest shades indicating the highest usage. The color scale adapts to your app's specific performance. Each area is a percentile range. To view the range for each color segment, mouse over the heat map's legend. Thresholds Different thresholds are dynamically applied to the colors based on the type of performance indicator you select from the dropdown and the maximum value your app has reported. For example, green for Average page load time may indicate 0 to 3.3 seconds, while green for Average network time may indicate 0 to 256 milliseconds. Circles The map's colored circles help you identify areas with performance problems at a glance. Each circle's radius is based on throughput reported for the city it represents, not the size of the city itself. You may see many circles overlapping each other. This usually indicates a grouping of metropolitan areas which represent a geographic area of heavy traffic. Filter performance metrics The Filter feature allows you to select and group data by attributes in various categories, including: Page view Geography Browser Identity Custom The filtered results appear on the geographical map, where you can use any of the standard map functions to explore additional details. Here are some examples. Unsatisfactory network performance by ASN In this example, your organization is preparing to renew a peering agreement with the owner of an autonomous system, called \"My-ASN.\" You are concerned that continued outages and other connection issues are affecting customer satisfaction with your site, and you want to compare its performance with other ASNs. You have a New Relic Browser Pro account. Go to one.newrelic.com > Browser > (select an app) > Filterable Geography. From the performance type dropdown, select Connection setup. Select the funnel icon. To view the specific ASN's performance: From the search window, type My-ASN, and then select this name from the Filter by results. OR To compare performance with other ASNs: From Geography attributes > ASN organizations, review the performance data for each organization on the list, and then select Back to groupings list. To close the filter list, select the funnel icon. Follow standard procedures to use the map functions and view comparative performance details. To clear the filter, select the attribute name. Page rendering performance during sales promotion In this example, your organization has a special three-day sales promotion for an upcoming holiday. Your holiday-merchandise page has undergone major changes, including dozens of new images. You want to look for performance problems with page rendering on Android mobile devices during this sales period. You have a New Relic Browser Pro account. Go to one.newrelic.com > Browser > (select an app) > Filterable Geography. Use the time picker to change the date range to the promotion period. From the performance type dropdown, select Page rendering. Select the funnel icon. From Page view attributes > Page Url, select your site's holiday-merchandise page, and then select Back to groupings list. From Browser attributes > User agent OS, select Android, and then select Back to groupings list. To close the filter list, select the funnel icon. Follow standard procedures to use the map functions and view comparative performance details. To clear the filters, select their attribute names. View comparative performance details Charts on the Page load performance and Historical performance tabs automatically refresh with comparative performance details for the selected location. one.newrelic.com > Browser > (select an app) > Browser app > Filterable Geography: Charts on the Page load performance and Historical performance tabs automatically refresh with details for the selected location. The Page load performance tab shows two charts. The Average page load time chart includes: Average page load time for each segment of the page load timing process in seconds Request queuing information (the time after a request enters your production systems and before it reaches your application) if applicable The Average network time chart shows key elements, including how long it takes for DNS lookup, connection establishment, and secure handshake, in seconds. Tip Sometimes areas on the charts may appear to be zero or near zero. This is because some apps use existing TCP connections, and they do not need to establish new connections. The Historical performance tab shows comparison data for the selected time period, yesterday, and last week for the selected location. This includes: Average response time Throughput in pages per minute (ppm) Available metrics You can filter and group geographical performance data in New Relic Browser and in New Relic Insights. Available metrics include: Performance Metrics Webpage Page load time Throughput (pages per minute or ppm) Network time Connection time Secure connection time Network Autonomous system number and name (ASN) via IP mapping SSL negotiation timing DNS timing Time to first byte ASN latitude and longitude for Internet service providers (ISPs) To ensure end user security, New Relic Browser collects GeoIP information for the end user's ISP. New Relic Browser does not collect GeoIP information for the specific end user. For example, if an end user in Portland, Oregon uses an ISP located in Beaverton, Oregon, New Relic Browser collects the GeoIP information for the ISP in Beaverton. User agents Operating systems Browser names or types Browser versions Device types Performance and usage ranges The color-coded legend shows performance and usage as percentile ranges. Performance color ranges Percentile colors for performance range from green (the best) to red (the worst).

Page load timing, individual asset loads, user interactions, AJAX requests, callbacks, errors, and other events appear in an interactive timeline which includes a detailed waterfall visualization, a heat map overview, and highlighted metrics and problems related to that session. Identify problems and solutions Session traces help you understand: How users experience your page load, including time to DOM load, time waiting for AJAX requests to complete, and the user's interactions with the page How the New Relic metrics reflect your end users' experiences What is the sequence of JavaScript and browser events, which take longer than others, and when each event occurs Where bottlenecks occur, and what may be causing them Why one page load may be slower than others, by providing the context for individual events during a session By connecting performance to user experience and interactions to performance, this detailed and intuitive visualization of all events in the user's session can help pinpoint problem areas and easily identify solutions. Requirements To use Browser monitoring's session traces feature, make sure you meet these requirements: Your agent version must support Browser monitoring. If you're using multiple names for an app, session traces will only report to the most specific application. For accounts older than October 2014, you must enable Browser monitoring and the enhanced Pro features. Browser randomly captures traces only from browsers that support the Resource Timing API. Select a session trace The Session traces index lists the most recent traces based on the time picker selection for the selected app. Session traces are randomly sampled and stored at a rate of 90/hour. You can page through up to 500 traces at a time. Additionally, you can sort and search the list by attributes, including: Full URL, with query string parameters removed Browser type Started at date/time Page load time one.newrelic.com > Browser > (select an app) > Session traces: You can select a session trace from the Browser index. You can also select a session trace directly from the Browser Summary, Page views, JS errors, and AJAX pages. To select a specific session trace: Go to one.newrelic.com and click Browser > (select an app) > Session traces. To locate a session trace from a different date or time period, use the time picker. To limit the index to a specific type of trace, use the search window. To view detailed information, select the session trace's link. Tip You can also select a session trace directly from the Browser Summary, Page views, JS errors and AJAX pages. View session trace details The Session trace details page provides summary information about the trace, a heat map with timing details, and a waterfall of events that you can explore. The color-coded legend identifies the page load events during the webpage's life cycle. For apps that have been deployed using the copy/paste method, Browser monitoring includes web app and queue time in Network time as part of the page load timing process. This is because Browser relies on the server-side agent to pass the application values to the Browser agent through auto-injection. You can view detailed information about how this \"back end\" time breaks down from the browser's point of view. The session traces report on all the network related events available, so you can see on a case-by-case basis how the browser spends time on DNS lookups and other network events. one.newrelic.com > Browser > (select an app) > Session traces > (select a trace): Use Browser's session trace details to examine events and identify problems during the end user's webpage session. To navigate through a session trace, explore the waterfall chart by scrolling vertically through the event stack, or select individual events to view their details. If you want to... Do this... View the web page for this session trace Select the trace link. Jump to a specific time Select the time indicator or event on the heat map. View details about individual events Select any event in the waterfall chart. From there, select View full details if applicable. Change the location on the session trace Click on the heat map, or scroll vertically through the waterfall chart. Zoom in or out of the overall trace Select the plus or minus icons below the heat map. Share the session trace information Create a permalink to paste into a form, ticket, email, etc. Session segment definitions Important session trace measurements are displayed in the upper right corner of the Session traces page. The first four measurements represent how long into a session that the segment ended. For example, if Page Load is 0.202s, that means that the page load event completed 0.202 seconds after the request began. Session segment Description Backend The time from when the request began to when backend activity finished and DOM loading began. DOM processing The time from when the request began to when DOM processing finished. Page load The time from when the request began to when the page load event fired. Waiting on AJAX The time from when the request began to when AJAX activity ended. First interaction The time from when the request began to when the first user activity, like a mouse click or a scroll, was recorded. Duration The total duration of the session. Slow JavaScript execution and repainting Session traces help you identify callbacks in your JavaScript code that execute slowly and block the execution of subsequent calls on the browser's main thread. These calls should execute quickly in order to allow the browser to quickly repaint the page in response to user actions. Session traces highlight any callbacks longer than 33ms. If called in rapid succession (such as inside a requestAnimationFrame loop), callbacks longer than 33ms reduce the frame rate below 30 frames per second. This speed seems sluggish to users.",

This document contains: Benefits of this feature Requirements Enable distributed tracing Enable cross-origin resource sharing (CORS) Find and query data Troubleshooting Tip Browser data is available in standard distributed tracing only, not Infinite Tracing. Benefits of browser data in distributed tracing By enabling New Relic to report browser data to distributed tracing, you can see the connection between front-end activity and back-end activity. You can see across a full transaction, from time spent by an end user in the web browser, to network activity, to associated back-end services. Benefits of this feature: Quickly spot latencies, errors, and anomalies in the browser or network Resolve customer-facing problems more quickly All the benefits of distributed tracing applied to your end-user monitoring Requirements and compatibility This feature reports AJAX requests (Fetch and XHR) that occur during a browser interaction. By default, only single-origin requests are monitored unless cross-origin resource sharing is enabled. Make sure you have the minimum versions for your Browser, APM, and APM agents: Browser Pro + SPA, with distributed tracing enabled Browser agent version 1153 or higher Browser agent version 1158 or higher (required for cross-origin resource sharing) Browser agent version 1173 or higher (required for w3c trace context support) APM agent version: C SDK 1.3 or higher Java 5.9.0 or higher PHP 9.4.0 or higher Other APM agent version requirements Enable distributed tracing To enable distributed tracing for Browser monitoring: Make sure you meet requirements, including having: Full-Stack Observability Browser Pro with SPA enabled Go to one.newrelic.com, and click Browser > (select an app) > Settings > Application settings. Turn on the Distributed tracing toggle. By default, for agent version 1173 and above, the newrelic, traceparent, and tracestate headers will be added to all same-origin AJAX requests. Optional: If all of your services are configured to use the w3c trace context headers, you can choose to exclude the newrelic, traceparent, and tracestate headers from requests. Optional: Enable cross-origin resource sharing. Redeploy the Browser agent (either restarting the associated APM agent or updating the copy/paste Browser installation). Enable cross-origin resource sharing (CORS) If you have AJAX requests that need resources from different origins, you can enable cross-origin resource sharing (CORS). By default, distributed tracing for cross-origin requests is not enabled because of browser CORS security restrictions: Distributed tracing is implemented by adding a custom HTTP headers (newrelic, traceparent, and tracestate) to outgoing AJAX requests, and browsers typically do not allow custom headers on cross-origin requests. With the release of agent version 1173, we now support the w3c trace context headers (traceparent and tracestate) so these should also be allowed in your configuration. There are two separate configurations required to enable cross-origin distributed tracing: Configure the service on the different origin to accept the newrelic custom header Configure Browser monitoring to include the target origin in distributed tracing Our step-by-step instructions provide key concepts and steps to enable this feature, but if you need more background about how cross-origin resource sharing works, we recommend this Mozilla developer document. Risks and mitigations Caution Cross-origin resource sharing can expose you to a high level of risk if the services on the different origins are not configured correctly. The AJAX requests will likely return an error, resulting in a variety of failures, including: Resources failing to load (for example, images and key content) Login failures Entire site outages (depending on type of requests enabled) By enabling this cross-origin resource sharing feature, you are acknowledging the following: You understand that this feature is optional and not mandatory. You understand the steps you need to take in order to enable this feature for your services and your domains. You understand that if you do not properly configure your services prior to deployment (including but not limited to configuring your services on your domains to accept custom headers) portions or all of your website will likely malfunction. You understand that New Relic is neither responsible nor liable for errors or issues related to your misconfiguration of servers or services. You fully and solely accept the risks and wish to proceed. The best way to minimize your risk is to ensure you fully understand the process and to try it first in a test environment. Before reading the step-by-step instructions, it may help to first read this overview of the process: To use distributed tracing with cross-origin resources, you populate a list of approved cross-origin resources in New Relic, and then we automatically send the following custom headers to those resources: newrelic, traceparent, and tracestate. For this process to work, you must first ensure that someone has configured the services on the other origins to accept this custom header. Cross-origin resource sharing uses a variety of HTTP headers (both in the request and response). The header that specifically applies to New Relic is the Access-Control-Allow-Headers response header, which can include newrelic, traceparent, tracestate, or newrelic, traceparent, tracestate in its value depending on what tracing strategies you enabled in your APM-monitored application. You must configure your server to return this CORS header in its response. Example: Access-Control-Allow-Headers: newrelic, traceparent, tracestate Important New Relic cannot perform any validation to ensure the services on the other origins were configured correctly. If you're unsure about how to allow these headers, do not add cross-origin resources to the approved list in the New Relic UI. Enable cross-origin resource sharing Caution You should always try enabling CORS in a test environment before setting it up in production. To enable cross-origin resource sharing: Confirm that the services on the other origins are configured to accept the newrelic header using: Access-Control-Allow-Headers: newrelic, traceparent, tracestate (for details, see Risks and mitigations). Confirm that you meet the Browser monitoring requirements. Make sure you are in one.newrelic.com, and click Browser > (select an app) > Application settings. Turn on the Distributed tracing toggle if it's not already enabled. Turn on the Cross-origin resource sharing (CORS) toggle. Under Cross-origin resource sharing (CORS), add cross-origin resources to the approved list. Important Valid cross-origin resources must include: The prefix http:// or https:// The domain name The port number is not required unless it differs from the default for HTTP (port 80) or HTTPS (port 443). Select Save application settings to update the agent configuration. Redeploy the Browser agent (either restarting the associated APM agent or updating the copy/paste Browser installation). Find data Tips for finding and querying data: You can find end-user-originating traces in any New Relic One distributed tracing UI. In the distributed tracing UI, end-user spans are indicated with the icon. To see a span's attributes, select a span in the UI. Spans are reported as Span data, and can be queried in New Relic. Query tips: Query by browser app name by setting browserApp.name to the browser app name. Query for traces containing at least one browser app span with browserApp.name is not null. Query for traces containing at least one back-end app with appName is not null. Query for traces containing both browser and back-end spans by combining the two previous conditions. Troubleshooting If you don't see end-user spans, or are having other distributed tracing issues, see Troubleshooting.",

      "body": "On Browser monitoring's JS errors UI page, error profiles give you insight about potential causes of your JavaScript errors. View error profiles To view Browser monitoring error profiles: Go to one.newrelic.com and click Browser > (select an app) > JS errors. To see error profile details: At the bottom of the JS errors UI page, select an error profile to expand it. What are error profiles? In Browser monitoring, an error profile is a potentially meaningful correlation New Relic has found between your JavaScript error attribute values when compared to normal PageView events. These correlations help you investigate the causes and contributing factors behind your errors. The screenshot below shows an example of an error profile. This error profile shows that the distribution of the userAgentOS attribute values varies significantly when JS error events are compared to normal (non-error) page view events. To investigate further, you could use the filter to display only Windows errors and see if there are other correlations. You can also filter the data used to generate error profiles to help you narrow down potential causes. For an analysis of a specific error profile, see the example error profile explanation. Filter error profile data To further filter the data used to generate error profiles and their comparison page views, use these JS errors page features: Time picker: select a time range used to generate the data. Filter: use the filter to display only error profiles and page views that have the attribute values you choose. You can select multiple attribute values. Example error profile explanation To help you better understand your own error profile data, this is an explanation of an example error profile's data. This error profile example has had a filter of userAgentName = Chrome applied, so it is only showing error data from Chrome browsers. This example profile has had a filter applied so that it is only showing error data from Chrome browsers. Column explanations: The first column is the attribute column. It shows the attribute values with the most deviation when compared to non-error page views. Less significant attribute values are aggregated in the Other category. In this example, the Chrome versions 36, 64, and 65 make up 100% of the errors for Chrome users. The JS errors column shows what percentage of JavaScriptError events have the attribute values from the first column. This column adds up to 100%, representing all errors from the chosen time range and filter set. In this example, a large percentage of Chrome errors are coming from Chrome version 36. If we wanted to investigate this further, we could filter to only show version 36 data. The Page views column shows what percentage of PageView events have the attribute values from the first column. In this example, less than 1% of Chrome users use Chrome version 36, but 55% of errors are generated by users with that version. The Difference column shows you the difference in percentage between the JS errors column and the Page views column.

      "body": "If you use Browser to monitor end-user browser activity, you can now see end-user-originating browser-side traces in distributed tracing. This document contains: Benefits of this feature Requirements Enable distributed tracing Enable cross-origin resource sharing (CORS) Find and query data Troubleshooting Tip Browser data is available in standard distributed tracing only, not Infinite Tracing. Benefits of browser data in distributed tracing By enabling New Relic to report browser data to distributed tracing, you can see the connection between front-end activity and back-end activity. You can see across a full transaction, from time spent by an end user in the web browser, to network activity, to associated back-end services. Benefits of this feature: Quickly spot latencies, errors, and anomalies in the browser or network Resolve customer-facing problems more quickly All the benefits of distributed tracing applied to your end-user monitoring Requirements and compatibility This feature reports AJAX requests (Fetch and XHR) that occur during a browser interaction. By default, only single-origin requests are monitored unless cross-origin resource sharing is enabled. Make sure you have the minimum versions for your Browser, APM, and APM agents: Browser Pro + SPA, with distributed tracing enabled Browser agent version 1153 or higher Browser agent version 1158 or higher (required for cross-origin resource sharing) Browser agent version 1173 or higher (required for w3c trace context support) APM agent version: C SDK 1.3 or higher Java 5.9.0 or higher PHP 9.4.0 or higher Other APM agent version requirements Enable distributed tracing To enable distributed tracing for Browser monitoring: Make sure you meet requirements, including having: Full-Stack Observability Browser Pro with SPA enabled Go to one.newrelic.com, and click Browser > (select an app) > Settings > Application settings. Turn on the Distributed tracing toggle. By default, for agent version 1173 and above, the newrelic, traceparent, and tracestate headers will be added to all same-origin AJAX requests. Optional: If all of your services are configured to use the w3c trace context headers, you can choose to exclude the newrelic, traceparent, and tracestate headers from requests. Optional: Enable cross-origin resource sharing. Redeploy the Browser agent (either restarting the associated APM agent or updating the copy/paste Browser installation). Enable cross-origin resource sharing (CORS) If you have AJAX requests that need resources from different origins, you can enable cross-origin resource sharing (CORS). By default, distributed tracing for cross-origin requests is not enabled because of browser CORS security restrictions: Distributed tracing is implemented by adding a custom HTTP headers (newrelic, traceparent, and tracestate) to outgoing AJAX requests, and browsers typically do not allow custom headers on cross-origin requests. With the release of agent version 1173, we now support the w3c trace context headers (traceparent and tracestate) so these should also be allowed in your configuration. There are two separate configurations required to enable cross-origin distributed tracing: Configure the service on the different origin to accept the newrelic custom header Configure Browser monitoring to include the target origin in distributed tracing Our step-by-step instructions provide key concepts and steps to enable this feature, but if you need more background about how cross-origin resource sharing works, we recommend this Mozilla developer document. Risks and mitigations Caution Cross-origin resource sharing can expose you to a high level of risk if the services on the different origins are not configured correctly. The AJAX requests will likely return an error, resulting in a variety of failures, including: Resources failing to load (for example, images and key content) Login failures Entire site outages (depending on type of requests enabled) By enabling this cross-origin resource sharing feature, you are acknowledging the following: You understand that this feature is optional and not mandatory. You understand the steps you need to take in order to enable this feature for your services and your domains. You understand that if you do not properly configure your services prior to deployment (including but not limited to configuring your services on your domains to accept custom headers) portions or all of your website will likely malfunction. You understand that New Relic is neither responsible nor liable for errors or issues related to your misconfiguration of servers or services. You fully and solely accept the risks and wish to proceed. The best way to minimize your risk is to ensure you fully understand the process and to try it first in a test environment. Before reading the step-by-step instructions, it may help to first read this overview of the process: To use distributed tracing with cross-origin resources, you populate a list of approved cross-origin resources in New Relic, and then we automatically send the following custom headers to those resources: newrelic, traceparent, and tracestate. For this process to work, you must first ensure that someone has configured the services on the other origins to accept this custom header. Cross-origin resource sharing uses a variety of HTTP headers (both in the request and response). The header that specifically applies to New Relic is the Access-Control-Allow-Headers response header, which can include newrelic, traceparent, tracestate, or newrelic, traceparent, tracestate in its value depending on what tracing strategies you enabled in your APM-monitored application. You must configure your server to return this CORS header in its response. Example: Access-Control-Allow-Headers: newrelic, traceparent, tracestate Important New Relic cannot perform any validation to ensure the services on the other origins were configured correctly. If you're unsure about how to allow these headers, do not add cross-origin resources to the approved list in the New Relic UI. Enable cross-origin resource sharing Caution You should always try enabling CORS in a test environment before setting it up in production. To enable cross-origin resource sharing: Confirm that the services on the other origins are configured to accept the newrelic header using: Access-Control-Allow-Headers: newrelic, traceparent, tracestate (for details, see Risks and mitigations). Confirm that you meet the Browser monitoring requirements. Make sure you are in one.newrelic.com, and click Browser > (select an app) > Application settings. Turn on the Distributed tracing toggle if it's not already enabled. Turn on the Cross-origin resource sharing (CORS) toggle. Under Cross-origin resource sharing (CORS), add cross-origin resources to the approved list. Important Valid cross-origin resources must include: The prefix http:// or https:// The domain name The port number is not required unless it differs from the default for HTTP (port 80) or HTTPS (port 443). Select Save application settings to update the agent configuration. Redeploy the Browser agent (either restarting the associated APM agent or updating the copy/paste Browser installation). Find data Tips for finding and querying data: You can find end-user-originating traces in any New Relic One distributed tracing UI. In the distributed tracing UI, end-user spans are indicated with the icon. To see a span's attributes, select a span in the UI. Spans are reported as Span data, and can be queried in New Relic. Query tips: Query by browser app name by setting browserApp.name to the browser app name. Query for traces containing at least one browser app span with browserApp.name is not null. Query for traces containing at least one back-end app with appName is not null. Query for traces containing both browser and back-end spans by combining the two previous conditions. Troubleshooting If you don't see end-user spans, or are having other distributed tracing issues, see Troubleshooting.",

      "body": "New Relic Browser's Filterable Geography page provides a world view with color-coded performance information about cities, regions, and countries anywhere around the world. You can filter and drill down into detailed information, or use your mouse to select or zoom in and out of any location on the map. The enhanced attributes provide deep visibility not only about your end users' experience with page load timing, but also with network performance anywhere around the world. This level of visual detail is especially useful for professionals in IT and Operations to make business decisions about peering agreements and CDN usage. Contents Requirements Your New Relic Browser subscription level and your time picker settings determine what data you can view: Pro or higher: As of January 2016, the Filterable Geography feature automatically appears in your New Relic Browser user interface. No special setup is required. You can view up to eight days of data. Your application must be enabled to send PageView data to New Relic Insights in order to use Filterable Geography. Lite: The Filterable Geography feature appears in your New Relic Browser's UI menu but currently is not available for use. Any subscription level: If you need to use New Relic Browser's legacy Geography feature, you can still view it from your selected browser app. Factors affecting collected data To capture page load timing information, New Relic Browser uses the Navigation Timing API, which most (but not all) browsers support. If the browsers do not support the Navigation Timing API, then New Relic Browser charts and data points can only show the network data they receive for DNS lookup, connection, secure handshake, etc. This may not be 100% of the app's overall traffic. Also, firewalls may have an impact on the geographical data collected about your end users. View performance data by location one.newrelic.com > Browser > (select an app) > Browser app > Filterable Geography: Here is an example of the map before drilling down into detailed information about London, England. To view or sort the performance information by location: Go to one.newrelic.com > Browser > (select an app) > Filterable Geography. Select the type of performance data to view from the dropdown, or use the default Average page load time. To drill down to a specific area, mouse over or select any area on the geographical map, or select any of the ten worst performing locations from the list to the right of the map. To view specific performance metrics, select any of the attributes below the funnel icon. To view comparison data, select the Page load performance or Historical performance chart below the selected location's geographical map. Use map functions Use any of New Relic's standard user interface functions and page functions to drill down into detailed information. Here is a summary of additional options with the Filterable Geography page. If you want to... Do this... Change what kind of performance data appears Select your choice from the dropdown. Default performance indicator is Average page load time. The map's legend lists the ten best or worst performing areas (depending on the selected performance indicator) for the selected time period. For example: If you select Count, the map's legend shows the top ten locations with the highest number of page loads, as well as the average page load time for each. If you select Connection setup, New Relic Browser first filters out areas with low throughput. Then the map's legend shows the top ten locations where average connection time is the slowest, as well as the average page load time and count for each. View summary performance information about a specific location Mouse over any colored area on the map, select a location from the list, or zoom in and out of any area on the map. View detailed data for a location Select any area of the map. For example: If you select Canada, the map and legend show color-coded performance data for each province and territory. The list to the right of the map shows the top ten worst performing areas. If you select a specific province or territory, the map shows color-coded performance data for the top ten cities. The map includes circled locations which you can mouse over or select to view detailed information. In addition, the Page load performance and Historical performance charts below the map automatically update with each location you select. Hide the list of available attributes Select the funnel icon. Return to a larger world view Select another location on the map, or clear the filter labels above the map. Tip To return to the original map view of the world, select any area on an ocean. Examine heat map details one.newrelic.com > Browser > (select an app) > Browser app > Filterable Geography: Here is an example of the map as you use filter and zoom tools to drill down into detailed information about London, England. Athough overall throughput for the area is good (green), the nearby yellow areas, and the smaller red and orange circles indicate nearby cities with varying levels of throughput problems, not the size of those cities. The Filterable Geography heat map identifies performance quality with color and with the size of circles. Heat map Description Color scale Performance quality ranges from green (the best) to yellow, orange, and then red (the worst). When selecting indicators of usage rather than performance, the heat map shows shades of purple, with the darkest shades indicating the highest usage. The color scale adapts to your app's specific performance. Each area is a percentile range. To view the range for each color segment, mouse over the heat map's legend. Thresholds Different thresholds are dynamically applied to the colors based on the type of performance indicator you select from the dropdown and the maximum value your app has reported. For example, green for Average page load time may indicate 0 to 3.3 seconds, while green for Average network time may indicate 0 to 256 milliseconds. Circles The map's colored circles help you identify areas with performance problems at a glance. Each circle's radius is based on throughput reported for the city it represents, not the size of the city itself. You may see many circles overlapping each other. This usually indicates a grouping of metropolitan areas which represent a geographic area of heavy traffic. Filter performance metrics The Filter feature allows you to select and group data by attributes in various categories, including: Page view Geography Browser Identity Custom The filtered results appear on the geographical map, where you can use any of the standard map functions to explore additional details. Here are some examples. Unsatisfactory network performance by ASN In this example, your organization is preparing to renew a peering agreement with the owner of an autonomous system, called \"My-ASN.\" You are concerned that continued outages and other connection issues are affecting customer satisfaction with your site, and you want to compare its performance with other ASNs. You have a New Relic Browser Pro account. Go to one.newrelic.com > Browser > (select an app) > Filterable Geography. From the performance type dropdown, select Connection setup. Select the funnel icon. To view the specific ASN's performance: From the search window, type My-ASN, and then select this name from the Filter by results. OR To compare performance with other ASNs: From Geography attributes > ASN organizations, review the performance data for each organization on the list, and then select Back to groupings list. To close the filter list, select the funnel icon. Follow standard procedures to use the map functions and view comparative performance details. To clear the filter, select the attribute name. Page rendering performance during sales promotion In this example, your organization has a special three-day sales promotion for an upcoming holiday. Your holiday-merchandise page has undergone major changes, including dozens of new images. You want to look for performance problems with page rendering on Android mobile devices during this sales period. You have a New Relic Browser Pro account. Go to one.newrelic.com > Browser > (select an app) > Filterable Geography. Use the time picker to change the date range to the promotion period. From the performance type dropdown, select Page rendering. Select the funnel icon. From Page view attributes > Page Url, select your site's holiday-merchandise page, and then select Back to groupings list. From Browser attributes > User agent OS, select Android, and then select Back to groupings list. To close the filter list, select the funnel icon. Follow standard procedures to use the map functions and view comparative performance details. To clear the filters, select their attribute names. View comparative performance details Charts on the Page load performance and Historical performance tabs automatically refresh with comparative performance details for the selected location. one.newrelic.com > Browser > (select an app) > Browser app > Filterable Geography: Charts on the Page load performance and Historical performance tabs automatically refresh with details for the selected location. The Page load performance tab shows two charts. The Average page load time chart includes: Average page load time for each segment of the page load timing process in seconds Request queuing information (the time after a request enters your production systems and before it reaches your application) if applicable The Average network time chart shows key elements, including how long it takes for DNS lookup, connection establishment, and secure handshake, in seconds. Tip Sometimes areas on the charts may appear to be zero or near zero. This is because some apps use existing TCP connections, and they do not need to establish new connections. The Historical performance tab shows comparison data for the selected time period, yesterday, and last week for the selected location. This includes: Average response time Throughput in pages per minute (ppm) Available metrics You can filter and group geographical performance data in New Relic Browser and in New Relic Insights. Available metrics include: Performance Metrics Webpage Page load time Throughput (pages per minute or ppm) Network time Connection time Secure connection time Network Autonomous system number and name (ASN) via IP mapping SSL negotiation timing DNS timing Time to first byte ASN latitude and longitude for Internet service providers (ISPs) To ensure end user security, New Relic Browser collects GeoIP information for the end user's ISP. New Relic Browser does not collect GeoIP information for the specific end user. For example, if an end user in Portland, Oregon uses an ISP located in Beaverton, Oregon, New Relic Browser collects the GeoIP information for the ISP in Beaverton. User agents Operating systems Browser names or types Browser versions Device types Performance and usage ranges The color-coded legend shows performance and usage as percentile ranges.

Requirements To use Browser monitoring's session traces feature, make sure you meet these requirements: Your agent version must support Browser monitoring. If you're using multiple names for an app, session traces will only report to the most specific application. For accounts older than October 2014, you must enable Browser monitoring and the enhanced Pro features. Browser randomly captures traces only from browsers that support the Resource Timing API. Select a session trace The Session traces index lists the most recent traces based on the time picker selection for the selected app. Session traces are randomly sampled and stored at a rate of 90/hour.

Share the session trace information Create a permalink to paste into a form, ticket, email, etc. Session segment definitions Important session trace measurements are displayed in the upper right corner of the Session traces page. The first four measurements represent how long into a session that the segment ended. For example, if Page Load is 0.202s, that means that the page load event completed 0.202 seconds after the request began. Session segment Description Backend The time from when the request began to when backend activity finished and DOM loading began. DOM processing The time from when the request began to when DOM processing finished. Page load The time from when the request began to when the page load event fired. Waiting on AJAX The time from when the request began to when AJAX activity ended. First interaction The time from when the request began to when the first user activity, like a mouse click or a scroll, was recorded. Duration The total duration of the session. Slow JavaScript execution and repainting Session traces help you identify callbacks in your JavaScript code that execute slowly and block the execution of subsequent calls on the browser's main thread. These calls should execute quickly in order to allow the browser to quickly repaint the page in response to user actions. Session traces highlight any callbacks longer than 33ms. If called in rapid succession (such as inside a requestAnimationFrame loop), callbacks longer than 33ms reduce the frame rate below 30 frames per second. This speed seems sluggish to users.",

      "body": "If you use Browser to monitor end-user browser activity, you can now see end-user-originating browser-side traces in distributed tracing. This document contains: Benefits of this feature Requirements Enable distributed tracing Enable cross-origin resource sharing (CORS) Find and query data Troubleshooting Tip Browser data is available in standard distributed tracing only, not Infinite Tracing. Benefits of browser data in distributed tracing By enabling New Relic to report browser data to distributed tracing, you can see the connection between front-end activity and back-end activity. You can see across a full transaction, from time spent by an end user in the web browser, to network activity, to associated back-end services. Benefits of this feature: Quickly spot latencies, errors, and anomalies in the browser or network Resolve customer-facing problems more quickly All the benefits of distributed tracing applied to your end-user monitoring Requirements and compatibility This feature reports AJAX requests (Fetch and XHR) that occur during a browser interaction. By default, only single-origin requests are monitored unless cross-origin resource sharing is enabled. Make sure you have the minimum versions for your Browser, APM, and APM agents: Browser Pro + SPA, with distributed tracing enabled Browser agent version 1153 or higher Browser agent version 1158 or higher (required for cross-origin resource sharing) Browser agent version 1173 or higher (required for w3c trace context support) APM agent version: C SDK 1.3 or higher Java 5.9.0 or higher PHP 9.4.0 or higher Other APM agent version requirements Enable distributed tracing To enable distributed tracing for Browser monitoring: Make sure you meet requirements, including having: Full-Stack Observability Browser Pro with SPA enabled Go to one.newrelic.com, and click Browser > (select an app) > Settings > Application settings. Turn on the Distributed tracing toggle. By default, for agent version 1173 and above, the newrelic, traceparent, and tracestate headers will be added to all same-origin AJAX requests. Optional: If all of your services are configured to use the w3c trace context headers, you can choose to exclude the newrelic, traceparent, and tracestate headers from requests. Optional: Enable cross-origin resource sharing. Redeploy the Browser agent (either restarting the associated APM agent or updating the copy/paste Browser installation). Enable cross-origin resource sharing (CORS) If you have AJAX requests that need resources from different origins, you can enable cross-origin resource sharing (CORS). By default, distributed tracing for cross-origin requests is not enabled because of browser CORS security restrictions: Distributed tracing is implemented by adding a custom HTTP headers (newrelic, traceparent, and tracestate) to outgoing AJAX requests, and browsers typically do not allow custom headers on cross-origin requests. With the release of agent version 1173, we now support the w3c trace context headers (traceparent and tracestate) so these should also be allowed in your configuration. There are two separate configurations required to enable cross-origin distributed tracing: Configure the service on the different origin to accept the newrelic custom header Configure Browser monitoring to include the target origin in distributed tracing Our step-by-step instructions provide key concepts and steps to enable this feature, but if you need more background about how cross-origin resource sharing works, we recommend this Mozilla developer document. Risks and mitigations Caution Cross-origin resource sharing can expose you to a high level of risk if the services on the different origins are not configured correctly. The AJAX requests will likely return an error, resulting in a variety of failures, including: Resources failing to load (for example, images and key content) Login failures Entire site outages (depending on type of requests enabled) By enabling this cross-origin resource sharing feature, you are acknowledging the following: You understand that this feature is optional and not mandatory. You understand the steps you need to take in order to enable this feature for your services and your domains. You understand that if you do not properly configure your services prior to deployment (including but not limited to configuring your services on your domains to accept custom headers) portions or all of your website will likely malfunction. You understand that New Relic is neither responsible nor liable for errors or issues related to your misconfiguration of servers or services. You fully and solely accept the risks and wish to proceed. The best way to minimize your risk is to ensure you fully understand the process and to try it first in a test environment. Before reading the step-by-step instructions, it may help to first read this overview of the process: To use distributed tracing with cross-origin resources, you populate a list of approved cross-origin resources in New Relic, and then we automatically send the following custom headers to those resources: newrelic, traceparent, and tracestate. For this process to work, you must first ensure that someone has configured the services on the other origins to accept this custom header. Cross-origin resource sharing uses a variety of HTTP headers (both in the request and response). The header that specifically applies to New Relic is the Access-Control-Allow-Headers response header, which can include newrelic, traceparent, tracestate, or newrelic, traceparent, tracestate in its value depending on what tracing strategies you enabled in your APM-monitored application. You must configure your server to return this CORS header in its response. Example: Access-Control-Allow-Headers: newrelic, traceparent, tracestate Important New Relic cannot perform any validation to ensure the services on the other origins were configured correctly. If you're unsure about how to allow these headers, do not add cross-origin resources to the approved list in the New Relic UI. Enable cross-origin resource sharing Caution You should always try enabling CORS in a test environment before setting it up in production. To enable cross-origin resource sharing: Confirm that the services on the other origins are configured to accept the newrelic header using: Access-Control-Allow-Headers: newrelic, traceparent, tracestate (for details, see Risks and mitigations). Confirm that you meet the Browser monitoring requirements. Make sure you are in one.newrelic.com, and click Browser > (select an app) > Application settings. Turn on the Distributed tracing toggle if it's not already enabled. Turn on the Cross-origin resource sharing (CORS) toggle. Under Cross-origin resource sharing (CORS), add cross-origin resources to the approved list. Important Valid cross-origin resources must include: The prefix http:// or https:// The domain name The port number is not required unless it differs from the default for HTTP (port 80) or HTTPS (port 443). Select Save application settings to update the agent configuration. Redeploy the Browser agent (either restarting the associated APM agent or updating the copy/paste Browser installation). Find data Tips for finding and querying data: You can find end-user-originating traces in any New Relic One distributed tracing UI. In the distributed tracing UI, end-user spans are indicated with the icon. To see a span's attributes, select a span in the UI. Spans are reported as Span data, and can be queried in New Relic. Query tips: Query by browser app name by setting browserApp.name to the browser app name. Query for traces containing at least one browser app span with browserApp.name is not null. Query for traces containing at least one back-end app with appName is not null. Query for traces containing both browser and back-end spans by combining the two previous conditions. Troubleshooting If you don't see end-user spans, or are having other distributed tracing issues, see Troubleshooting.",

You can filter and drill down into detailed information, or use your mouse to select or zoom in and out of any location on the map. The enhanced attributes provide deep visibility not only about your end users' experience with page load timing, but also with network performance anywhere around the world. This level of visual detail is especially useful for professionals in IT and Operations to make business decisions about peering agreements and CDN usage. Contents Requirements Your New Relic Browser subscription level and your time picker settings determine what data you can view: Pro or higher: As of January 2016, the Filterable Geography feature automatically appears in your New Relic Browser user interface. No special setup is required. You can view up to eight days of data. Your application must be enabled to send PageView data to New Relic Insights in order to use Filterable Geography. Lite: The Filterable Geography feature appears in your New Relic Browser's UI menu but currently is not available for use. Any subscription level: If you need to use New Relic Browser's legacy Geography feature, you can still view it from your selected browser app. Factors affecting collected data To capture page load timing information, New Relic Browser uses the Navigation Timing API, which most (but not all) browsers support. If the browsers do not support the Navigation Timing API, then New Relic Browser charts and data points can only show the network data they receive for DNS lookup, connection, secure handshake, etc. This may not be 100% of the app's overall traffic. Also, firewalls may have an impact on the geographical data collected about your end users. View performance data by location one.newrelic.com > Browser > (select an app) > Browser app > Filterable Geography: Here is an example of the map before drilling down into detailed information about London, England. To view or sort the performance information by location: Go to one.newrelic.com > Browser > (select an app) > Filterable Geography. Select the type of performance data to view from the dropdown, or use the default Average page load time. To drill down to a specific area, mouse over or select any area on the geographical map, or select any of the ten worst performing locations from the list to the right of the map. To view specific performance metrics, select any of the attributes below the funnel icon. To view comparison data, select the Page load performance or Historical performance chart below the selected location's geographical map. Use map functions Use any of New Relic's standard user interface functions and page functions to drill down into detailed information. Here is a summary of additional options with the Filterable Geography page. If you want to... Do this... Change what kind of performance data appears Select your choice from the dropdown. Default performance indicator is Average page load time. The map's legend lists the ten best or worst performing areas (depending on the selected performance indicator) for the selected time period. For example: If you select Count, the map's legend shows the top ten locations with the highest number of page loads, as well as the average page load time for each. If you select Connection setup, New Relic Browser first filters out areas with low throughput. Then the map's legend shows the top ten locations where average connection time is the slowest, as well as the average page load time and count for each. View summary performance information about a specific location Mouse over any colored area on the map, select a location from the list, or zoom in and out of any area on the map. View detailed data for a location Select any area of the map. For example: If you select Canada, the map and legend show color-coded performance data for each province and territory. The list to the right of the map shows the top ten worst performing areas. If you select a specific province or territory, the map shows color-coded performance data for the top ten cities. The map includes circled locations which you can mouse over or select to view detailed information. In addition, the Page load performance and Historical performance charts below the map automatically update with each location you select. Hide the list of available attributes Select the funnel icon. Return to a larger world view Select another location on the map, or clear the filter labels above the map. Tip To return to the original map view of the world, select any area on an ocean. Examine heat map details one.newrelic.com > Browser > (select an app) > Browser app > Filterable Geography: Here is an example of the map as you use filter and zoom tools to drill down into detailed information about London, England. Athough overall throughput for the area is good (green), the nearby yellow areas, and the smaller red and orange circles indicate nearby cities with varying levels of throughput problems, not the size of those cities. The Filterable Geography heat map identifies performance quality with color and with the size of circles. Heat map Description Color scale Performance quality ranges from green (the best) to yellow, orange, and then red (the worst). When selecting indicators of usage rather than performance, the heat map shows shades of purple, with the darkest shades indicating the highest usage. The color scale adapts to your app's specific performance. Each area is a percentile range. To view the range for each color segment, mouse over the heat map's legend. Thresholds Different thresholds are dynamically applied to the colors based on the type of performance indicator you select from the dropdown and the maximum value your app has reported. For example, green for Average page load time may indicate 0 to 3.3 seconds, while green for Average network time may indicate 0 to 256 milliseconds. Circles The map's colored circles help you identify areas with performance problems at a glance. Each circle's radius is based on throughput reported for the city it represents, not the size of the city itself. You may see many circles overlapping each other. This usually indicates a grouping of metropolitan areas which represent a geographic area of heavy traffic. Filter performance metrics The Filter feature allows you to select and group data by attributes in various categories, including: Page view Geography Browser Identity Custom The filtered results appear on the geographical map, where you can use any of the standard map functions to explore additional details. Here are some examples. Unsatisfactory network performance by ASN In this example, your organization is preparing to renew a peering agreement with the owner of an autonomous system, called \"My-ASN.\" You are concerned that continued outages and other connection issues are affecting customer satisfaction with your site, and you want to compare its performance with other ASNs. You have a New Relic Browser Pro account. Go to one.newrelic.com > Browser > (select an app) > Filterable Geography. From the performance type dropdown, select Connection setup. Select the funnel icon. To view the specific ASN's performance: From the search window, type My-ASN, and then select this name from the Filter by results. OR To compare performance with other ASNs: From Geography attributes > ASN organizations, review the performance data for each organization on the list, and then select Back to groupings list. To close the filter list, select the funnel icon. Follow standard procedures to use the map functions and view comparative performance details. To clear the filter, select the attribute name. Page rendering performance during sales promotion In this example, your organization has a special three-day sales promotion for an upcoming holiday. Your holiday-merchandise page has undergone major changes, including dozens of new images. You want to look for performance problems with page rendering on Android mobile devices during this sales period. You have a New Relic Browser Pro account. Go to one.newrelic.com > Browser > (select an app) > Filterable Geography. Use the time picker to change the date range to the promotion period. From the performance type dropdown, select Page rendering. Select the funnel icon. From Page view attributes > Page Url, select your site's holiday-merchandise page, and then select Back to groupings list. From Browser attributes > User agent OS, select Android, and then select Back to groupings list. To close the filter list, select the funnel icon. Follow standard procedures to use the map functions and view comparative performance details. To clear the filters, select their attribute names. View comparative performance details Charts on the Page load performance and Historical performance tabs automatically refresh with comparative performance details for the selected location. one.newrelic.com > Browser > (select an app) > Browser app > Filterable Geography: Charts on the Page load performance and Historical performance tabs automatically refresh with details for the selected location. The Page load performance tab shows two charts. The Average page load time chart includes: Average page load time for each segment of the page load timing process in seconds Request queuing information (the time after a request enters your production systems and before it reaches your application) if applicable The Average network time chart shows key elements, including how long it takes for DNS lookup, connection establishment, and secure handshake, in seconds. Tip Sometimes areas on the charts may appear to be zero or near zero. This is because some apps use existing TCP connections, and they do not need to establish new connections. The Historical performance tab shows comparison data for the selected time period, yesterday, and last week for the selected location. This includes: Average response time Throughput in pages per minute (ppm) Available metrics You can filter and group geographical performance data in New Relic Browser and in New Relic Insights. Available metrics include: Performance Metrics Webpage Page load time Throughput (pages per minute or ppm) Network time Connection time Secure connection time Network Autonomous system number and name (ASN) via IP mapping SSL negotiation timing DNS timing Time to first byte ASN latitude and longitude for Internet service providers (ISPs) To ensure end user security, New Relic Browser collects GeoIP information for the end user's ISP. New Relic Browser does not collect GeoIP information for the specific end user. For example, if an end user in Portland, Oregon uses an ISP located in Beaverton, Oregon, New Relic Browser collects the GeoIP information for the ISP in Beaverton. User agents Operating systems Browser names or types Browser versions Device types Performance and usage ranges The color-coded legend shows performance and usage as percentile ranges.

Page load timing, individual asset loads, user interactions, AJAX requests, callbacks, errors, and other events appear in an interactive timeline which includes a detailed waterfall visualization, a heat map overview, and highlighted metrics and problems related to that session. Identify problems and solutions Session traces help you understand: How users experience your page load, including time to DOM load, time waiting for AJAX requests to complete, and the user's interactions with the page How the New Relic metrics reflect your end users' experiences What is the sequence of JavaScript and browser events, which take longer than others, and when each event occurs Where bottlenecks occur, and what may be causing them Why one page load may be slower than others, by providing the context for individual events during a session By connecting performance to user experience and interactions to performance, this detailed and intuitive visualization of all events in the user's session can help pinpoint problem areas and easily identify solutions. Requirements To use Browser monitoring's session traces feature, make sure you meet these requirements: Your agent version must support Browser monitoring. If you're using multiple names for an app, session traces will only report to the most specific application. For accounts older than October 2014, you must enable Browser monitoring and the enhanced Pro features. Browser randomly captures traces only from browsers that support the Resource Timing API. Select a session trace The Session traces index lists the most recent traces based on the time picker selection for the selected app. Session traces are randomly sampled and stored at a rate of 90/hour. You can page through up to 500 traces at a time. Additionally, you can sort and search the list by attributes, including: Full URL, with query string parameters removed Browser type Started at date/time Page load time one.newrelic.com > Browser > (select an app) > Session traces: You can select a session trace from the Browser index. You can also select a session trace directly from the Browser Summary, Page views, JS errors, and AJAX pages. To select a specific session trace: Go to one.newrelic.com and click Browser > (select an app) > Session traces. To locate a session trace from a different date or time period, use the time picker. To limit the index to a specific type of trace, use the search window. To view detailed information, select the session trace's link. Tip You can also select a session trace directly from the Browser Summary, Page views, JS errors and AJAX pages. View session trace details The Session trace details page provides summary information about the trace, a heat map with timing details, and a waterfall of events that you can explore. The color-coded legend identifies the page load events during the webpage's life cycle. For apps that have been deployed using the copy/paste method, Browser monitoring includes web app and queue time in Network time as part of the page load timing process. This is because Browser relies on the server-side agent to pass the application values to the Browser agent through auto-injection. You can view detailed information about how this \"back end\" time breaks down from the browser's point of view. The session traces report on all the network related events available, so you can see on a case-by-case basis how the browser spends time on DNS lookups and other network events. one.newrelic.com > Browser > (select an app) > Session traces > (select a trace): Use Browser's session trace details to examine events and identify problems during the end user's webpage session. To navigate through a session trace, explore the waterfall chart by scrolling vertically through the event stack, or select individual events to view their details. If you want to... Do this... View the web page for this session trace Select the trace link. Jump to a specific time Select the time indicator or event on the heat map. View details about individual events Select any event in the waterfall chart. From there, select View full details if applicable. Change the location on the session trace Click on the heat map, or scroll vertically through the waterfall chart. Zoom in or out of the overall trace Select the plus or minus icons below the heat map. Share the session trace information Create a permalink to paste into a form, ticket, email, etc. Session segment definitions Important session trace measurements are displayed in the upper right corner of the Session traces page. The first four measurements represent how long into a session that the segment ended. For example, if Page Load is 0.202s, that means that the page load event completed 0.202 seconds after the request began. Session segment Description Backend The time from when the request began to when backend activity finished and DOM loading began. DOM processing The time from when the request began to when DOM processing finished. Page load The time from when the request began to when the page load event fired. Waiting on AJAX The time from when the request began to when AJAX activity ended. First interaction The time from when the request began to when the first user activity, like a mouse click or a scroll, was recorded. Duration The total duration of the session. Slow JavaScript execution and repainting Session traces help you identify callbacks in your JavaScript code that execute slowly and block the execution of subsequent calls on the browser's main thread. These calls should execute quickly in order to allow the browser to quickly repaint the page in response to user actions. Session traces highlight any callbacks longer than 33ms. If called in rapid succession (such as inside a requestAnimationFrame loop), callbacks longer than 33ms reduce the frame rate below 30 frames per second. This speed seems sluggish to users.",

This document contains: Benefits of this feature Requirements Enable distributed tracing Enable cross-origin resource sharing (CORS) Find and query data Troubleshooting Tip Browser data is available in standard distributed tracing only, not Infinite Tracing. Benefits of browser data in distributed tracing By enabling New Relic to report browser data to distributed tracing, you can see the connection between front-end activity and back-end activity. You can see across a full transaction, from time spent by an end user in the web browser, to network activity, to associated back-end services. Benefits of this feature: Quickly spot latencies, errors, and anomalies in the browser or network Resolve customer-facing problems more quickly All the benefits of distributed tracing applied to your end-user monitoring Requirements and compatibility This feature reports AJAX requests (Fetch and XHR) that occur during a browser interaction. By default, only single-origin requests are monitored unless cross-origin resource sharing is enabled. Make sure you have the minimum versions for your Browser, APM, and APM agents: Browser Pro + SPA, with distributed tracing enabled Browser agent version 1153 or higher Browser agent version 1158 or higher (required for cross-origin resource sharing) Browser agent version 1173 or higher (required for w3c trace context support) APM agent version: C SDK 1.3 or higher Java 5.9.0 or higher PHP 9.4.0 or higher Other APM agent version requirements Enable distributed tracing To enable distributed tracing for Browser monitoring: Make sure you meet requirements, including having: Full-Stack Observability Browser Pro with SPA enabled Go to one.newrelic.com, and click Browser > (select an app) > Settings > Application settings. Turn on the Distributed tracing toggle. By default, for agent version 1173 and above, the newrelic, traceparent, and tracestate headers will be added to all same-origin AJAX requests. Optional: If all of your services are configured to use the w3c trace context headers, you can choose to exclude the newrelic, traceparent, and tracestate headers from requests. Optional: Enable cross-origin resource sharing. Redeploy the Browser agent (either restarting the associated APM agent or updating the copy/paste Browser installation). Enable cross-origin resource sharing (CORS) If you have AJAX requests that need resources from different origins, you can enable cross-origin resource sharing (CORS). By default, distributed tracing for cross-origin requests is not enabled because of browser CORS security restrictions: Distributed tracing is implemented by adding a custom HTTP headers (newrelic, traceparent, and tracestate) to outgoing AJAX requests, and browsers typically do not allow custom headers on cross-origin requests. With the release of agent version 1173, we now support the w3c trace context headers (traceparent and tracestate) so these should also be allowed in your configuration. There are two separate configurations required to enable cross-origin distributed tracing: Configure the service on the different origin to accept the newrelic custom header Configure Browser monitoring to include the target origin in distributed tracing Our step-by-step instructions provide key concepts and steps to enable this feature, but if you need more background about how cross-origin resource sharing works, we recommend this Mozilla developer document. Risks and mitigations Caution Cross-origin resource sharing can expose you to a high level of risk if the services on the different origins are not configured correctly. The AJAX requests will likely return an error, resulting in a variety of failures, including: Resources failing to load (for example, images and key content) Login failures Entire site outages (depending on type of requests enabled) By enabling this cross-origin resource sharing feature, you are acknowledging the following: You understand that this feature is optional and not mandatory. You understand the steps you need to take in order to enable this feature for your services and your domains. You understand that if you do not properly configure your services prior to deployment (including but not limited to configuring your services on your domains to accept custom headers) portions or all of your website will likely malfunction. You understand that New Relic is neither responsible nor liable for errors or issues related to your misconfiguration of servers or services. You fully and solely accept the risks and wish to proceed. The best way to minimize your risk is to ensure you fully understand the process and to try it first in a test environment. Before reading the step-by-step instructions, it may help to first read this overview of the process: To use distributed tracing with cross-origin resources, you populate a list of approved cross-origin resources in New Relic, and then we automatically send the following custom headers to those resources: newrelic, traceparent, and tracestate. For this process to work, you must first ensure that someone has configured the services on the other origins to accept this custom header. Cross-origin resource sharing uses a variety of HTTP headers (both in the request and response). The header that specifically applies to New Relic is the Access-Control-Allow-Headers response header, which can include newrelic, traceparent, tracestate, or newrelic, traceparent, tracestate in its value depending on what tracing strategies you enabled in your APM-monitored application. You must configure your server to return this CORS header in its response. Example: Access-Control-Allow-Headers: newrelic, traceparent, tracestate Important New Relic cannot perform any validation to ensure the services on the other origins were configured correctly. If you're unsure about how to allow these headers, do not add cross-origin resources to the approved list in the New Relic UI. Enable cross-origin resource sharing Caution You should always try enabling CORS in a test environment before setting it up in production. To enable cross-origin resource sharing: Confirm that the services on the other origins are configured to accept the newrelic header using: Access-Control-Allow-Headers: newrelic, traceparent, tracestate (for details, see Risks and mitigations). Confirm that you meet the Browser monitoring requirements. Make sure you are in one.newrelic.com, and click Browser > (select an app) > Application settings. Turn on the Distributed tracing toggle if it's not already enabled. Turn on the Cross-origin resource sharing (CORS) toggle. Under Cross-origin resource sharing (CORS), add cross-origin resources to the approved list. Important Valid cross-origin resources must include: The prefix http:// or https:// The domain name The port number is not required unless it differs from the default for HTTP (port 80) or HTTPS (port 443). Select Save application settings to update the agent configuration. Redeploy the Browser agent (either restarting the associated APM agent or updating the copy/paste Browser installation). Find data Tips for finding and querying data: You can find end-user-originating traces in any New Relic One distributed tracing UI. In the distributed tracing UI, end-user spans are indicated with the icon. To see a span's attributes, select a span in the UI. Spans are reported as Span data, and can be queried in New Relic. Query tips: Query by browser app name by setting browserApp.name to the browser app name. Query for traces containing at least one browser app span with browserApp.name is not null. Query for traces containing at least one back-end app with appName is not null. Query for traces containing both browser and back-end spans by combining the two previous conditions. Troubleshooting If you don't see end-user spans, or are having other distributed tracing issues, see Troubleshooting.",

      "body": "Browser uses a JavaScript snippet (or \"agent\") to instrument your app's webpages. The JavaScript collects data for browser monitoring. To install the browser agent, you can choose from a number of deployment options. Tip To use Browser and the rest of our observability platform, join the New Relic family! Sign up to create your free account in only a few seconds. Then ingest up to 100GB of data for free each month. Forever. Select a deployment option No matter which option you use to deploy browser monitoring, the end result is to inject the browser agent's JavaScript snippet into your pages for browser monitoring. The method you select depends on your preferences and business needs. To view the procedure to install and enable the browser agent, click the link for the option you want to use. You can also use the Browser Application settings page to update settings. Important The following configuration options refer only to the browser monitoring agent. These are not the same as the New Relic user roles and editions. Browser deployment option Description Use the APM agent to inject the JavaScript You can use an APM agent to automatically inject the browser monitoring JavaScript snippet for you. This is the easiest way to install the agent for an app that already is being monitored by APM. (APM-monitored apps are listed on your APM Applications index.) Paste the JavaScript snippet into a webpage This allows you to control the exact placement of the JavaScript into your app's webpage(s) by copying and pasting the browser agent's JavaScript snippet. This is useful for: Standalone apps, static sites, and cached pages delivered by CDN APM apps that are not as closely coupled to the browser app as with a standard server-side app (for example, when your client-side app talks to a REST API back end) Enable single-page app (SPA) monitoring Enabling SPA requires a Pro + SPA browser agent subscription, and you may need to re-deploy the browser JavaScript agent. Use the REST API The REST API lets you manage deployment outside the browser UI. This is useful for large organizations deploying multiple apps. Use an APM agent API to manually instrument the JavaScript snippet For apps that are monitored by APM, you can use the APM agent's API to inject the JavaScript manually instead of automatically. Enable an APM-monitored app Use this procedure to automatically deploy the browser agent on an app that is monitored by APM: Go to one.newrelic.com, select Browser, and then select Add more data. In the Back-end, front-end, and mobile applications section, select the New Relic Browser tile. When prompted to select the account you want to add this instrumentation to, choose your account, and click Continue. From the Get started with New Relic Browser page, in the Choose a deployment method section, select Enable via New Relic APM. In the Choose your instrumentation section, select Lite, Pro, or Pro + SPA. In the Configure your instrumentation section, make the selections you want. In the Select your application section, type or use the search window to find an app's name. Click Enable. Important Node.js: To finish enabling the browser agent for a Node.js app, follow the additional procedure to insert the JavaScript header into the beginning of your HTML page's head tag. Generate some traffic for your app. Wait a few minutes for Browser to start collecting data, then select your app from the Browser applications index. Enable with copy/paste Use this procedure to insert browser's JavaScript snippet for browser monitoring into your app's webpages yourself. This option is useful for monitoring static sites (such as Jekyll) or cached pages delivered by CDN. Tip Near the bottom of the generated JavaScript is your browser license key and application ID. This is useful with the REST API and API Explorer. Go to one.newrelic.com, select Browser, and then select Add more data. In the Back-end, front-end, and mobile applications section, select the New Relic Browser tile. When prompted to select the account you want to add this instrumentation to, choose your account, and click Continue. From the Get started with New Relic Browser page, in the Choose a deployment method section, select Copy/Paste JavaScript Code. In the Choose your instrumentation section, select the type of agent: Lite, Pro, or Pro + SPA. In the Configure your instrumentation section, make the selections you want. In the Name your app section, name your app: If your app is monitored by APM, select Yes, then type or use the search window to find the app's name. If you have a standalone app for Browser (not monitored by APM), select No, then type the app's name. Click Enable. A new section, Instrument the agent, opens on the page with JavaScript code for your project. Copy the code snippet, then paste it inline into your pages as close to the top of the <head> element as possible, but after any position-sensitive <meta> tags (for example, X-UA-Compatible or charset information). For more information on the inline head placement, see JavaScript placement requirements. Generate some traffic for your app. Wait a few minutes for Browser to start collecting data, then select your app from the Browser applications index. If you use the copy/paste method, but don't finish the setup process, you can still view and copy the generated JavaScript snippet from your app's Browser Application settings page or by using the REST API (v2). Instrument webpages using the APM agent This information applies to apps that are also monitored by APM. New Relic's agents can instrument webpages with the required JavaScript for page load timing. If you use the APM agent to add the JavaScript snippet to your webpages, insert the instrumentation snippet as close to the top as possible. This allows you to take advantage of detailed information about browser's AJAX calls and JavaScript errors. For more information, see the instructions for your APM agent: C SDK Go Java .NET Node.js PHP Python Ruby Troubleshoot Browser agent installation When you enable browser Pro features for session traces, AJAX calls, or JavaScript errors, it may take approximately five minutes before information becomes available. If you have problems with your browser installation or if no data appears after five minutes, refer to the troubleshooting tips, and restart your agent.",

Rename app monitored by APM If you added an app to Browser already being monitored by APM, the app name that appears in Browser is the same as the app name in the APM UI. To rename the app, use any of these options as applicable. Option Comments Rename and continue collecting data This option is useful when you simply want to give an app a different display name (alias). To change the alias that appears in the New Relic UI, use the app's Settings page: Go to one.newrelic.com > APM > (select an app) > Settings > Application. Stop reporting under the old name To stop reporting data under the old name and begin collecting data with a new name (app identifer), use the APM agent's configuration file. This changes the identifier that New Relic's data collector uses to distinguish one app from another.

There are two separate configurations required to enable cross-origin distributed tracing: Configure the service on the different origin to accept the newrelic custom header Configure Browser monitoring to include the target origin in distributed tracing Our step-by-step instructions provide key concepts and steps to enable this feature, but if you need more background about how cross-origin resource sharing works, we recommend this Mozilla developer document. Risks and mitigations Caution Cross-origin resource sharing can expose you to a high level of risk if the services on the different origins are not configured correctly. The AJAX requests will likely return an error, resulting in a variety of failures, including: Resources failing to load (for example, images and key content) Login failures Entire site outages (depending on type of requests enabled) By enabling this cross-origin resource sharing feature, you are acknowledging the following: You understand that this feature is optional and not mandatory. You understand the steps you need to take in order to enable this feature for your services and your domains. You understand that if you do not properly configure your services prior to deployment (including but not limited to configuring your services on your domains to accept custom headers) portions or all of your website will likely malfunction. You understand that New Relic is neither responsible nor liable for errors or issues related to your misconfiguration of servers or services. You fully and solely accept the risks and wish to proceed. The best way to minimize your risk is to ensure you fully understand the process and to try it first in a test environment. Before reading the step-by-step instructions, it may help to first read this overview of the process: To use distributed tracing with cross-origin resources, you populate a list of approved cross-origin resources in New Relic, and then we automatically send the following custom headers to those resources: newrelic, traceparent, and tracestate. For this process to work, you must first ensure that someone has configured the services on the other origins to accept this custom header. Cross-origin resource sharing uses a variety of HTTP headers (both in the request and response). The header that specifically applies to New Relic is the Access-Control-Allow-Headers response header, which can include newrelic, traceparent, tracestate, or newrelic, traceparent, tracestate in its value depending on what tracing strategies you enabled in your APM-monitored application. You must configure your server to return this CORS header in its response. Example: Access-Control-Allow-Headers: newrelic, traceparent, tracestate Important New Relic cannot perform any validation to ensure the services on the other origins were configured correctly. If you're unsure about how to allow these headers, do not add cross-origin resources to the approved list in the New Relic UI. Enable cross-origin resource sharing Caution You should always try enabling CORS in a test environment before setting it up in production. To enable cross-origin resource sharing: Confirm that the services on the other origins are configured to accept the newrelic header using: Access-Control-Allow-Headers: newrelic, traceparent, tracestate (for details, see Risks and mitigations). Confirm that you meet the Browser monitoring requirements. Make sure you are in one.newrelic.com, and click Browser > (select an app) > Application settings. Turn on the Distributed tracing toggle if it's not already enabled. Turn on the Cross-origin resource sharing (CORS) toggle. Under Cross-origin resource sharing (CORS), add cross-origin resources to the approved list. Important Valid cross-origin resources must include: The prefix http:// or https:// The domain name The port number is not required unless it differs from the default for HTTP (port 80) or HTTPS (port 443). Select Save application settings to update the agent configuration. Redeploy the Browser agent (either restarting the associated APM agent or updating the copy/paste Browser installation). Find data Tips for finding and querying data: You can find end-user-originating traces in any New Relic One distributed tracing UI. In the distributed tracing UI, end-user spans are indicated with the icon. To see a span's attributes, select a span in the UI. Spans are reported as Span data, and can be queried in New Relic. Query tips: Query by browser app name by setting browserApp.name to the browser app name. Query for traces containing at least one browser app span with browserApp.name is not null. Query for traces containing at least one back-end app with appName is not null. Query for traces containing both browser and back-end spans by combining the two previous conditions. Troubleshooting If you don't see end-user spans, or are having other distributed tracing issues, see Troubleshooting.",

To install the browser agent, you can choose from a number of deployment options. Tip To use Browser and the rest of our observability platform, join the New Relic family! Sign up to create your free account in only a few seconds. Then ingest up to 100GB of data for free each month. Forever. Select a deployment option No matter which option you use to deploy browser monitoring, the end result is to inject the browser agent's JavaScript snippet into your pages for browser monitoring. The method you select depends on your preferences and business needs. To view the procedure to install and enable the browser agent, click the link for the option you want to use. You can also use the Browser Application settings page to update settings. Important The following configuration options refer only to the browser monitoring agent. These are not the same as the New Relic user roles and editions. Browser deployment option Description Use the APM agent to inject the JavaScript You can use an APM agent to automatically inject the browser monitoring JavaScript snippet for you. This is the easiest way to install the agent for an app that already is being monitored by APM. (APM-monitored apps are listed on your APM Applications index.) Paste the JavaScript snippet into a webpage This allows you to control the exact placement of the JavaScript into your app's webpage(s) by copying and pasting the browser agent's JavaScript snippet. This is useful for: Standalone apps, static sites, and cached pages delivered by CDN APM apps that are not as closely coupled to the browser app as with a standard server-side app (for example, when your client-side app talks to a REST API back end) Enable single-page app (SPA) monitoring Enabling SPA requires a Pro + SPA browser agent subscription, and you may need to re-deploy the browser JavaScript agent. Use the REST API The REST API lets you manage deployment outside the browser UI. This is useful for large organizations deploying multiple apps. Use an APM agent API to manually instrument the JavaScript snippet For apps that are monitored by APM, you can use the APM agent's API to inject the JavaScript manually instead of automatically. Enable an APM-monitored app Use this procedure to automatically deploy the browser agent on an app that is monitored by APM: Go to one.newrelic.com, select Browser, and then select Add more data. In the Back-end, front-end, and mobile applications section, select the New Relic Browser tile. When prompted to select the account you want to add this instrumentation to, choose your account, and click Continue. From the Get started with New Relic Browser page, in the Choose a deployment method section, select Enable via New Relic APM. In the Choose your instrumentation section, select Lite, Pro, or Pro + SPA. In the Configure your instrumentation section, make the selections you want. In the Select your application section, type or use the search window to find an app's name. Click Enable. Important Node.js: To finish enabling the browser agent for a Node.js app, follow the additional procedure to insert the JavaScript header into the beginning of your HTML page's head tag. Generate some traffic for your app. Wait a few minutes for Browser to start collecting data, then select your app from the Browser applications index. Enable with copy/paste Use this procedure to insert browser's JavaScript snippet for browser monitoring into your app's webpages yourself. This option is useful for monitoring static sites (such as Jekyll) or cached pages delivered by CDN. Tip Near the bottom of the generated JavaScript is your browser license key and application ID. This is useful with the REST API and API Explorer. Go to one.newrelic.com, select Browser, and then select Add more data. In the Back-end, front-end, and mobile applications section, select the New Relic Browser tile. When prompted to select the account you want to add this instrumentation to, choose your account, and click Continue. From the Get started with New Relic Browser page, in the Choose a deployment method section, select Copy/Paste JavaScript Code. In the Choose your instrumentation section, select the type of agent: Lite, Pro, or Pro + SPA. In the Configure your instrumentation section, make the selections you want. In the Name your app section, name your app: If your app is monitored by APM, select Yes, then type or use the search window to find the app's name. If you have a standalone app for Browser (not monitored by APM), select No, then type the app's name. Click Enable. A new section, Instrument the agent, opens on the page with JavaScript code for your project. Copy the code snippet, then paste it inline into your pages as close to the top of the <head> element as possible, but after any position-sensitive <meta> tags (for example, X-UA-Compatible or charset information). For more information on the inline head placement, see JavaScript placement requirements. Generate some traffic for your app. Wait a few minutes for Browser to start collecting data, then select your app from the Browser applications index. If you use the copy/paste method, but don't finish the setup process, you can still view and copy the generated JavaScript snippet from your app's Browser Application settings page or by using the REST API (v2). Instrument webpages using the APM agent This information applies to apps that are also monitored by APM. New Relic's agents can instrument webpages with the required JavaScript for page load timing. If you use the APM agent to add the JavaScript snippet to your webpages, insert the instrumentation snippet as close to the top as possible. This allows you to take advantage of detailed information about browser's AJAX calls and JavaScript errors. For more information, see the instructions for your APM agent: C SDK Go Java .NET Node.js PHP Python Ruby Troubleshoot Browser agent installation When you enable browser Pro features for session traces, AJAX calls, or JavaScript errors, it may take approximately five minutes before information becomes available. If you have problems with your browser installation or if no data appears after five minutes, refer to the troubleshooting tips, and restart your agent.",

Rename app monitored by APM If you added an app to Browser already being monitored by APM, the app name that appears in Browser is the same as the app name in the APM UI. To rename the app, use any of these options as applicable. Option Comments Rename and continue collecting data This option is useful when you simply want to give an app a different display name (alias). To change the alias that appears in the New Relic UI, use the app's Settings page: Go to one.newrelic.com > APM > (select an app) > Settings > Application. Stop reporting under the old name To stop reporting data under the old name and begin collecting data with a new name (app identifer), use the APM agent's configuration file. This changes the identifier that New Relic's data collector uses to distinguish one app from another. Based on the data retention schedule, New Relic will retain historical data collected under the old name, and will collect and aggregate data under the new name. If one or more apps share the same name, then their data will be aggregated in the UI. Caution If you change the app identifier, a new application will appear in our user interface with the new name, and data will stop reporting to the app(s) with the old name. Rename app via JavaScript snippet This information applies if you inserted Browser's JavaScript snippet into your: App monitored by APM that was deployed via the copy/paste method Single page app (SPA) Any standalone Browser app that is not also monitored by APM You cannot directly edit the JavaScript snippet in the existing app. Instead, to use your app with a different name: Follow standard procedures to create a new app using the copy/paste method. Provide the new name, and generate the JavaScript snippet. Copy the new JavaScript snippet. In your webpage, replace the JavaScript from your original app with the JavaScript generated for the new app name. If your standalone app has multiple names, copy the custom app IDs in your configuration script to your new app. Based on the data retention schedule, New Relic will retain historical data collected under the old name, and will collect and aggregate data under the new name.

Rename app monitored by APM If you added an app to Browser already being monitored by APM, the app name that appears in Browser is the same as the app name in the APM UI. To rename the app, use any of these options as applicable. Option Comments Rename and continue collecting data This option is useful when you simply want to give an app a different display name (alias). To change the alias that appears in the New Relic UI, use the app's Settings page: Go to one.newrelic.com > APM > (select an app) > Settings > Application. Stop reporting under the old name To stop reporting data under the old name and begin collecting data with a new name (app identifer), use the APM agent's configuration file. This changes the identifier that New Relic's data collector uses to distinguish one app from another. Based on the data retention schedule, New Relic will retain historical data collected under the old name, and will collect and aggregate data under the new name. If one or more apps share the same name, then their data will be aggregated in the UI. Caution If you change the app identifier, a new application will appear in our user interface with the new name, and data will stop reporting to the app(s) with the old name. Rename app via JavaScript snippet This information applies if you inserted Browser's JavaScript snippet into your: App monitored by APM that was deployed via the copy/paste method Single page app (SPA) Any standalone Browser app that is not also monitored by APM You cannot directly edit the JavaScript snippet in the existing app. Instead, to use your app with a different name: Follow standard procedures to create a new app using the copy/paste method. Provide the new name, and generate the JavaScript snippet. Copy the new JavaScript snippet. In your webpage, replace the JavaScript from your original app with the JavaScript generated for the new app name. If your standalone app has multiple names, copy the custom app IDs in your configuration script to your new app. Based on the data retention schedule, New Relic will retain historical data collected under the old name, and will collect and aggregate data under the new name. Rename app via New Relic REST API (v2) This information applies only to Browser apps that are also monitored by APM. You cannot change the app name via the REST API if you used the copy/paste method to insert Browser's JavaScript snippet into your app. Follow standard procedures to change the APM app alias via REST API or API Explorer.

This document contains: Benefits of this feature Requirements Enable distributed tracing Enable cross-origin resource sharing (CORS) Find and query data Troubleshooting Tip Browser data is available in standard distributed tracing only, not Infinite Tracing. Benefits of browser data in distributed tracing By enabling New Relic to report browser data to distributed tracing, you can see the connection between front-end activity and back-end activity. You can see across a full transaction, from time spent by an end user in the web browser, to network activity, to associated back-end services. Benefits of this feature: Quickly spot latencies, errors, and anomalies in the browser or network Resolve customer-facing problems more quickly All the benefits of distributed tracing applied to your end-user monitoring Requirements and compatibility This feature reports AJAX requests (Fetch and XHR) that occur during a browser interaction. By default, only single-origin requests are monitored unless cross-origin resource sharing is enabled. Make sure you have the minimum versions for your Browser, APM, and APM agents: Browser Pro + SPA, with distributed tracing enabled Browser agent version 1153 or higher Browser agent version 1158 or higher (required for cross-origin resource sharing) Browser agent version 1173 or higher (required for w3c trace context support) APM agent version: C SDK 1.3 or higher Java 5.9.0 or higher PHP 9.4.0 or higher Other APM agent version requirements Enable distributed tracing To enable distributed tracing for Browser monitoring: Make sure you meet requirements, including having: Full-Stack Observability Browser Pro with SPA enabled Go to one.newrelic.com, and click Browser > (select an app) > Settings > Application settings. Turn on the Distributed tracing toggle. By default, for agent version 1173 and above, the newrelic, traceparent, and tracestate headers will be added to all same-origin AJAX requests. Optional: If all of your services are configured to use the w3c trace context headers, you can choose to exclude the newrelic, traceparent, and tracestate headers from requests. Optional: Enable cross-origin resource sharing. Redeploy the Browser agent (either restarting the associated APM agent or updating the copy/paste Browser installation). Enable cross-origin resource sharing (CORS) If you have AJAX requests that need resources from different origins, you can enable cross-origin resource sharing (CORS). By default, distributed tracing for cross-origin requests is not enabled because of browser CORS security restrictions: Distributed tracing is implemented by adding a custom HTTP headers (newrelic, traceparent, and tracestate) to outgoing AJAX requests, and browsers typically do not allow custom headers on cross-origin requests. With the release of agent version 1173, we now support the w3c trace context headers (traceparent and tracestate) so these should also be allowed in your configuration. There are two separate configurations required to enable cross-origin distributed tracing: Configure the service on the different origin to accept the newrelic custom header Configure Browser monitoring to include the target origin in distributed tracing Our step-by-step instructions provide key concepts and steps to enable this feature, but if you need more background about how cross-origin resource sharing works, we recommend this Mozilla developer document. Risks and mitigations Caution Cross-origin resource sharing can expose you to a high level of risk if the services on the different origins are not configured correctly. The AJAX requests will likely return an error, resulting in a variety of failures, including: Resources failing to load (for example, images and key content) Login failures Entire site outages (depending on type of requests enabled) By enabling this cross-origin resource sharing feature, you are acknowledging the following: You understand that this feature is optional and not mandatory. You understand the steps you need to take in order to enable this feature for your services and your domains. You understand that if you do not properly configure your services prior to deployment (including but not limited to configuring your services on your domains to accept custom headers) portions or all of your website will likely malfunction. You understand that New Relic is neither responsible nor liable for errors or issues related to your misconfiguration of servers or services. You fully and solely accept the risks and wish to proceed. The best way to minimize your risk is to ensure you fully understand the process and to try it first in a test environment. Before reading the step-by-step instructions, it may help to first read this overview of the process: To use distributed tracing with cross-origin resources, you populate a list of approved cross-origin resources in New Relic, and then we automatically send the following custom headers to those resources: newrelic, traceparent, and tracestate. For this process to work, you must first ensure that someone has configured the services on the other origins to accept this custom header. Cross-origin resource sharing uses a variety of HTTP headers (both in the request and response). The header that specifically applies to New Relic is the Access-Control-Allow-Headers response header, which can include newrelic, traceparent, tracestate, or newrelic, traceparent, tracestate in its value depending on what tracing strategies you enabled in your APM-monitored application. You must configure your server to return this CORS header in its response. Example: Access-Control-Allow-Headers: newrelic, traceparent, tracestate Important New Relic cannot perform any validation to ensure the services on the other origins were configured correctly. If you're unsure about how to allow these headers, do not add cross-origin resources to the approved list in the New Relic UI. Enable cross-origin resource sharing Caution You should always try enabling CORS in a test environment before setting it up in production. To enable cross-origin resource sharing: Confirm that the services on the other origins are configured to accept the newrelic header using: Access-Control-Allow-Headers: newrelic, traceparent, tracestate (for details, see Risks and mitigations). Confirm that you meet the Browser monitoring requirements. Make sure you are in one.newrelic.com, and click Browser > (select an app) > Application settings. Turn on the Distributed tracing toggle if it's not already enabled. Turn on the Cross-origin resource sharing (CORS) toggle. Under Cross-origin resource sharing (CORS), add cross-origin resources to the approved list. Important Valid cross-origin resources must include: The prefix http:// or https:// The domain name The port number is not required unless it differs from the default for HTTP (port 80) or HTTPS (port 443). Select Save application settings to update the agent configuration. Redeploy the Browser agent (either restarting the associated APM agent or updating the copy/paste Browser installation). Find data Tips for finding and querying data: You can find end-user-originating traces in any New Relic One distributed tracing UI. In the distributed tracing UI, end-user spans are indicated with the icon. To see a span's attributes, select a span in the UI. Spans are reported as Span data, and can be queried in New Relic. Query tips: Query by browser app name by setting browserApp.name to the browser app name. Query for traces containing at least one browser app span with browserApp.name is not null. Query for traces containing at least one back-end app with appName is not null. Query for traces containing both browser and back-end spans by combining the two previous conditions. Troubleshooting If you don't see end-user spans, or are having other distributed tracing issues, see Troubleshooting.",

If you use the APM app deployment method, your Settings page will not show the JavaScript snippet. Tip You can also use the New Relic REST API (v2) or API Explorer to list these values. When you select anywhere in the JavaScript snippet that appears in the user interface, Browser monitoring automatically selects the entire snippet. The browser monitoring license key and application ID appear near the end of the JavaScript snippet. one.newrelic.com > Browser > Settings: The end of the JavaScript generated for copy/paste deployments includes your browser monitoring license key and application ID. To obtain only the browser monitoring license key and application ID information: Go to one.newrelic.com > Browser > Settings. Select and copy the generated JavaScript, and paste it into a text file. Delete everything in the text file except the browser monitoring license key and app ID information (just above the ending </script> tag), and save.

This document contains: Benefits of this feature Requirements Enable distributed tracing Enable cross-origin resource sharing (CORS) Find and query data Troubleshooting Tip Browser data is available in standard distributed tracing only, not Infinite Tracing. Benefits of browser data in distributed tracing By enabling New Relic to report browser data to distributed tracing, you can see the connection between front-end activity and back-end activity. You can see across a full transaction, from time spent by an end user in the web browser, to network activity, to associated back-end services. Benefits of this feature: Quickly spot latencies, errors, and anomalies in the browser or network Resolve customer-facing problems more quickly All the benefits of distributed tracing applied to your end-user monitoring Requirements and compatibility This feature reports AJAX requests (Fetch and XHR) that occur during a browser interaction. By default, only single-origin requests are monitored unless cross-origin resource sharing is enabled. Make sure you have the minimum versions for your Browser, APM, and APM agents: Browser Pro + SPA, with distributed tracing enabled Browser agent version 1153 or higher Browser agent version 1158 or higher (required for cross-origin resource sharing) Browser agent version 1173 or higher (required for w3c trace context support) APM agent version: C SDK 1.3 or higher Java 5.9.0 or higher PHP 9.4.0 or higher Other APM agent version requirements Enable distributed tracing To enable distributed tracing for Browser monitoring: Make sure you meet requirements, including having: Full-Stack Observability Browser Pro with SPA enabled Go to one.newrelic.com, and click Browser > (select an app) > Settings > Application settings. Turn on the Distributed tracing toggle. By default, for agent version 1173 and above, the newrelic, traceparent, and tracestate headers will be added to all same-origin AJAX requests. Optional: If all of your services are configured to use the w3c trace context headers, you can choose to exclude the newrelic, traceparent, and tracestate headers from requests. Optional: Enable cross-origin resource sharing. Redeploy the Browser agent (either restarting the associated APM agent or updating the copy/paste Browser installation). Enable cross-origin resource sharing (CORS) If you have AJAX requests that need resources from different origins, you can enable cross-origin resource sharing (CORS). By default, distributed tracing for cross-origin requests is not enabled because of browser CORS security restrictions: Distributed tracing is implemented by adding a custom HTTP headers (newrelic, traceparent, and tracestate) to outgoing AJAX requests, and browsers typically do not allow custom headers on cross-origin requests. With the release of agent version 1173, we now support the w3c trace context headers (traceparent and tracestate) so these should also be allowed in your configuration. There are two separate configurations required to enable cross-origin distributed tracing: Configure the service on the different origin to accept the newrelic custom header Configure Browser monitoring to include the target origin in distributed tracing Our step-by-step instructions provide key concepts and steps to enable this feature, but if you need more background about how cross-origin resource sharing works, we recommend this Mozilla developer document. Risks and mitigations Caution Cross-origin resource sharing can expose you to a high level of risk if the services on the different origins are not configured correctly. The AJAX requests will likely return an error, resulting in a variety of failures, including: Resources failing to load (for example, images and key content) Login failures Entire site outages (depending on type of requests enabled) By enabling this cross-origin resource sharing feature, you are acknowledging the following: You understand that this feature is optional and not mandatory. You understand the steps you need to take in order to enable this feature for your services and your domains. You understand that if you do not properly configure your services prior to deployment (including but not limited to configuring your services on your domains to accept custom headers) portions or all of your website will likely malfunction. You understand that New Relic is neither responsible nor liable for errors or issues related to your misconfiguration of servers or services. You fully and solely accept the risks and wish to proceed. The best way to minimize your risk is to ensure you fully understand the process and to try it first in a test environment. Before reading the step-by-step instructions, it may help to first read this overview of the process: To use distributed tracing with cross-origin resources, you populate a list of approved cross-origin resources in New Relic, and then we automatically send the following custom headers to those resources: newrelic, traceparent, and tracestate. For this process to work, you must first ensure that someone has configured the services on the other origins to accept this custom header. Cross-origin resource sharing uses a variety of HTTP headers (both in the request and response). The header that specifically applies to New Relic is the Access-Control-Allow-Headers response header, which can include newrelic, traceparent, tracestate, or newrelic, traceparent, tracestate in its value depending on what tracing strategies you enabled in your APM-monitored application. You must configure your server to return this CORS header in its response. Example: Access-Control-Allow-Headers: newrelic, traceparent, tracestate Important New Relic cannot perform any validation to ensure the services on the other origins were configured correctly. If you're unsure about how to allow these headers, do not add cross-origin resources to the approved list in the New Relic UI. Enable cross-origin resource sharing Caution You should always try enabling CORS in a test environment before setting it up in production. To enable cross-origin resource sharing: Confirm that the services on the other origins are configured to accept the newrelic header using: Access-Control-Allow-Headers: newrelic, traceparent, tracestate (for details, see Risks and mitigations). Confirm that you meet the Browser monitoring requirements. Make sure you are in one.newrelic.com, and click Browser > (select an app) > Application settings. Turn on the Distributed tracing toggle if it's not already enabled. Turn on the Cross-origin resource sharing (CORS) toggle. Under Cross-origin resource sharing (CORS), add cross-origin resources to the approved list. Important Valid cross-origin resources must include: The prefix http:// or https:// The domain name The port number is not required unless it differs from the default for HTTP (port 80) or HTTPS (port 443). Select Save application settings to update the agent configuration. Redeploy the Browser agent (either restarting the associated APM agent or updating the copy/paste Browser installation). Find data Tips for finding and querying data: You can find end-user-originating traces in any New Relic One distributed tracing UI. In the distributed tracing UI, end-user spans are indicated with the icon. To see a span's attributes, select a span in the UI. Spans are reported as Span data, and can be queried in New Relic. Query tips: Query by browser app name by setting browserApp.name to the browser app name. Query for traces containing at least one browser app span with browserApp.name is not null. Query for traces containing at least one back-end app with appName is not null. Query for traces containing both browser and back-end spans by combining the two previous conditions. Troubleshooting If you don't see end-user spans, or are having other distributed tracing issues, see Troubleshooting.",

      "body": "Browser uses a JavaScript snippet (or \"agent\") to instrument your app's webpages. The JavaScript collects data for browser monitoring. To install the browser agent, you can choose from a number of deployment options. Tip To use Browser and the rest of our observability platform, join the New Relic family! Sign up to create your free account in only a few seconds. Then ingest up to 100GB of data for free each month. Forever. Select a deployment option No matter which option you use to deploy browser monitoring, the end result is to inject the browser agent's JavaScript snippet into your pages for browser monitoring. The method you select depends on your preferences and business needs. To view the procedure to install and enable the browser agent, click the link for the option you want to use. You can also use the Browser Application settings page to update settings. Important The following configuration options refer only to the browser monitoring agent. These are not the same as the New Relic user roles and editions. Browser deployment option Description Use the APM agent to inject the JavaScript You can use an APM agent to automatically inject the browser monitoring JavaScript snippet for you. This is the easiest way to install the agent for an app that already is being monitored by APM. (APM-monitored apps are listed on your APM Applications index.) Paste the JavaScript snippet into a webpage This allows you to control the exact placement of the JavaScript into your app's webpage(s) by copying and pasting the browser agent's JavaScript snippet. This is useful for: Standalone apps, static sites, and cached pages delivered by CDN APM apps that are not as closely coupled to the browser app as with a standard server-side app (for example, when your client-side app talks to a REST API back end) Enable single-page app (SPA) monitoring Enabling SPA requires a Pro + SPA browser agent subscription, and you may need to re-deploy the browser JavaScript agent. Use the REST API The REST API lets you manage deployment outside the browser UI. This is useful for large organizations deploying multiple apps. Use an APM agent API to manually instrument the JavaScript snippet For apps that are monitored by APM, you can use the APM agent's API to inject the JavaScript manually instead of automatically. Enable an APM-monitored app Use this procedure to automatically deploy the browser agent on an app that is monitored by APM: Go to one.newrelic.com, select Browser, and then select Add more data. In the Back-end, front-end, and mobile applications section, select the New Relic Browser tile. When prompted to select the account you want to add this instrumentation to, choose your account, and click Continue. From the Get started with New Relic Browser page, in the Choose a deployment method section, select Enable via New Relic APM. In the Choose your instrumentation section, select Lite, Pro, or Pro + SPA. In the Configure your instrumentation section, make the selections you want. In the Select your application section, type or use the search window to find an app's name. Click Enable. Important Node.js: To finish enabling the browser agent for a Node.js app, follow the additional procedure to insert the JavaScript header into the beginning of your HTML page's head tag. Generate some traffic for your app. Wait a few minutes for Browser to start collecting data, then select your app from the Browser applications index. Enable with copy/paste Use this procedure to insert browser's JavaScript snippet for browser monitoring into your app's webpages yourself. This option is useful for monitoring static sites (such as Jekyll) or cached pages delivered by CDN. Tip Near the bottom of the generated JavaScript is your browser license key and application ID. This is useful with the REST API and API Explorer. Go to one.newrelic.com, select Browser, and then select Add more data. In the Back-end, front-end, and mobile applications section, select the New Relic Browser tile. When prompted to select the account you want to add this instrumentation to, choose your account, and click Continue. From the Get started with New Relic Browser page, in the Choose a deployment method section, select Copy/Paste JavaScript Code. In the Choose your instrumentation section, select the type of agent: Lite, Pro, or Pro + SPA. In the Configure your instrumentation section, make the selections you want. In the Name your app section, name your app: If your app is monitored by APM, select Yes, then type or use the search window to find the app's name. If you have a standalone app for Browser (not monitored by APM), select No, then type the app's name. Click Enable. A new section, Instrument the agent, opens on the page with JavaScript code for your project. Copy the code snippet, then paste it inline into your pages as close to the top of the <head> element as possible, but after any position-sensitive <meta> tags (for example, X-UA-Compatible or charset information). For more information on the inline head placement, see JavaScript placement requirements. Generate some traffic for your app. Wait a few minutes for Browser to start collecting data, then select your app from the Browser applications index. If you use the copy/paste method, but don't finish the setup process, you can still view and copy the generated JavaScript snippet from your app's Browser Application settings page or by using the REST API (v2). Instrument webpages using the APM agent This information applies to apps that are also monitored by APM. New Relic's agents can instrument webpages with the required JavaScript for page load timing. If you use the APM agent to add the JavaScript snippet to your webpages, insert the instrumentation snippet as close to the top as possible. This allows you to take advantage of detailed information about browser's AJAX calls and JavaScript errors. For more information, see the instructions for your APM agent: C SDK Go Java .NET Node.js PHP Python Ruby Troubleshoot Browser agent installation When you enable browser Pro features for session traces, AJAX calls, or JavaScript errors, it may take approximately five minutes before information becomes available. If you have problems with your browser installation or if no data appears after five minutes, refer to the troubleshooting tips, and restart your agent.",

Rename app monitored by APM If you added an app to Browser already being monitored by APM, the app name that appears in Browser is the same as the app name in the APM UI. To rename the app, use any of these options as applicable. Option Comments Rename and continue collecting data This option is useful when you simply want to give an app a different display name (alias). To change the alias that appears in the New Relic UI, use the app's Settings page: Go to one.newrelic.com > APM > (select an app) > Settings > Application. Stop reporting under the old name To stop reporting data under the old name and begin collecting data with a new name (app identifer), use the APM agent's configuration file. This changes the identifier that New Relic's data collector uses to distinguish one app from another. Based on the data retention schedule, New Relic will retain historical data collected under the old name, and will collect and aggregate data under the new name. If one or more apps share the same name, then their data will be aggregated in the UI.

      "body": "Browser monitoring includes strict security measures to provide a robust, standalone product with browser monitoring features. Before you install the Browser agent, make sure your system meets these requirements. Basic requirements To report data to Browser, your application must at a minimum meet two basic requirements: The traffic to the application must be from clients able to load and execute Browser JavaScript code and set cookies. Clients accessing the application must be able to send data to New Relic through HTTP requests. HTTPS is required for Browser Pro features. Important Browsers that subscribe to a disconnect list or that use content filtering extensions such as AdBlock may not be able to send data to New Relic. For example, if you are using the Enhanced Tracking Prevention disconnect list for Mozilla Firefox 69.0 or higher, you will need to change the default configuration. Most typical browser applications meet these requirements. However, browser applications in restricted environments may have difficulty reporting data to New Relic; for example: Hybrid mobile applications Applications installed on unusual hardware, such as point-of-sale terminals or consumer appliances For more information, review the instrumentation for browser monitoring documentation, and verify end-user network access. Browser types Instrumentation is compatible with every browser type, including Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox, Microsoft Internet Explorer and Edge, and Apple Safari. The user interface is compatible with New Relic's supported browser versions. Exceptions Comments Paint timings The firstPaint and firstContentfulPaint attributes in BrowserInteraction, PageView, and PageViewTiming events are only compatible with: Chrome 60 or higher for desktop and mobile (Android webview and Chrome for Android) Opera 47 or higher for desktop Opera 44 or higher for Android mobile Samsung Internet for mobile AJAX AJAX timing features are not available with: Chrome for iPhone and iPad IE 7 and 8 PageAction events PageAction events require a browser that fully supports cross-domain XMLHttpRequests. Internet Explorer versions 9 and lower cannot record PageAction events. Learn more on querying your data. Session traces Session traces are reported only from browsers that support the Resource Timing Specification. SHA-256 New Relic can only monitor browsers that are compatible with SHA-256. APM agents You can deploy the Browser agent for apps monitored by APM, or you can deploy the Browser agent for your standalone apps. For more information, see the installation procedures. If you are deploying Browser for an app using APM, make sure your agent supports Browser monitoring: C SDK: Version 1.0.0 or higher Go: Version 2.5.0 or higher Java: Version 3.4.0 or higher .NET: Version 2.20.25.0 or higher Node.js: Version 1.4.0 or higher PHP: Version 4.4.5.35 or higher Python: Version 2.10.1.9 or higher Ruby: Version 3.7.0.177 or higher Supported frameworks The Browser agent collects data on all front-end frameworks. However, the monitoring occurs on lower-level \"primitives\" that JavaScript frameworks use, so the level of detail collected by the instrumentation may vary depending on your specific framework. Exceptions Comments Zone.js If you're using AngularJS and you want to use Browser's SPA monitoring capabilities, note that Zone.js versions 0.6.18 to 0.6.24 are not compatible with Browser. In all cases, the Browser agent must be loaded before Zone.js to avoid errors. Cypress.io Browser is unable to properly instrument the open and send methods of requests when tests are run in Cypress. This will cause the following error to be thrown: Cannot set property 'status' of undefined Copy This will only affect customers running tests with the Browser agent present in their code. Production applications should not be affected. html2pdf.js This library is not compatible with our SPA-enabled Browser agent due to the way this library wraps promises. If you're using this library, we recommend the Browser Pro agent. Content Security Policy (CSP) considerations In order to obtain accurate browser performance metrics, Browser requires the use of a small, inline JavaScript snippet. New Relic carefully reviews the inline JavaScript to prevent Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) and other potential vulnerabilities. Content Security Policy Level 2 adds restrictions to the types of JavaScript allowed, such as inline scripts. It also limits which domains can load scripts during page load. Important If your website does not allow any third-party hosted JavaScript to run, you must request a CSP exception via your organization’s standard procedures in order to install the Browser monitoring agent. When requesting a CSP exception, follow your organization's standard procedures to contact your web or security team. The Browser JavaScript agent requires the following CSP exceptions in order to run properly. Alternatively, you can add all of these exceptions to the fallback default-src directive (instead of script-src and connect-src). CSP exception Comments unsafe-inline Add to the script-src directive or to the fallback default-src directive. This is required because the agent is installed by including an inline script. https://js-agent.newrelic.com Add to the script-src directive or to the fallback default-src directive. This is where additional script files that the agent requires are hosted. https://bam.nr-data.net https://bam-cell.nr-data.net Important Add https://gov-bam.nr-data.net if you're using FedRAMP-compliant endpoints. Add to the script-src directive or to the fallback default-src directive. This is where the agent sends its collected data. One of the calls to this URL is a JSONP call, which means that the URL must be allowed as a script source. Add to the connect-src directive or to the fallback default-src directive. The connect-src directive affects the URLs that scripts can call (for example, using the XMLHttpRequest interface). If you have CSP restrictions specifically around this directive, then add this URL as an exception.",

This document contains: Benefits of this feature Requirements Enable distributed tracing Enable cross-origin resource sharing (CORS) Find and query data Troubleshooting Tip Browser data is available in standard distributed tracing only, not Infinite Tracing. Benefits of browser data in distributed tracing By enabling New Relic to report browser data to distributed tracing, you can see the connection between front-end activity and back-end activity. You can see across a full transaction, from time spent by an end user in the web browser, to network activity, to associated back-end services. Benefits of this feature: Quickly spot latencies, errors, and anomalies in the browser or network Resolve customer-facing problems more quickly All the benefits of distributed tracing applied to your end-user monitoring Requirements and compatibility This feature reports AJAX requests (Fetch and XHR) that occur during a browser interaction. By default, only single-origin requests are monitored unless cross-origin resource sharing is enabled. Make sure you have the minimum versions for your Browser, APM, and APM agents: Browser Pro + SPA, with distributed tracing enabled Browser agent version 1153 or higher Browser agent version 1158 or higher (required for cross-origin resource sharing) Browser agent version 1173 or higher (required for w3c trace context support) APM agent version: C SDK 1.3 or higher Java 5.9.0 or higher PHP 9.4.0 or higher Other APM agent version requirements Enable distributed tracing To enable distributed tracing for Browser monitoring: Make sure you meet requirements, including having: Full-Stack Observability Browser Pro with SPA enabled Go to one.newrelic.com, and click Browser > (select an app) > Settings > Application settings. Turn on the Distributed tracing toggle. By default, for agent version 1173 and above, the newrelic, traceparent, and tracestate headers will be added to all same-origin AJAX requests. Optional: If all of your services are configured to use the w3c trace context headers, you can choose to exclude the newrelic, traceparent, and tracestate headers from requests. Optional: Enable cross-origin resource sharing. Redeploy the Browser agent (either restarting the associated APM agent or updating the copy/paste Browser installation). Enable cross-origin resource sharing (CORS) If you have AJAX requests that need resources from different origins, you can enable cross-origin resource sharing (CORS). By default, distributed tracing for cross-origin requests is not enabled because of browser CORS security restrictions: Distributed tracing is implemented by adding a custom HTTP headers (newrelic, traceparent, and tracestate) to outgoing AJAX requests, and browsers typically do not allow custom headers on cross-origin requests. With the release of agent version 1173, we now support the w3c trace context headers (traceparent and tracestate) so these should also be allowed in your configuration. There are two separate configurations required to enable cross-origin distributed tracing: Configure the service on the different origin to accept the newrelic custom header Configure Browser monitoring to include the target origin in distributed tracing Our step-by-step instructions provide key concepts and steps to enable this feature, but if you need more background about how cross-origin resource sharing works, we recommend this Mozilla developer document. Risks and mitigations Caution Cross-origin resource sharing can expose you to a high level of risk if the services on the different origins are not configured correctly. The AJAX requests will likely return an error, resulting in a variety of failures, including: Resources failing to load (for example, images and key content) Login failures Entire site outages (depending on type of requests enabled) By enabling this cross-origin resource sharing feature, you are acknowledging the following: You understand that this feature is optional and not mandatory. You understand the steps you need to take in order to enable this feature for your services and your domains. You understand that if you do not properly configure your services prior to deployment (including but not limited to configuring your services on your domains to accept custom headers) portions or all of your website will likely malfunction. You understand that New Relic is neither responsible nor liable for errors or issues related to your misconfiguration of servers or services. You fully and solely accept the risks and wish to proceed. The best way to minimize your risk is to ensure you fully understand the process and to try it first in a test environment. Before reading the step-by-step instructions, it may help to first read this overview of the process: To use distributed tracing with cross-origin resources, you populate a list of approved cross-origin resources in New Relic, and then we automatically send the following custom headers to those resources: newrelic, traceparent, and tracestate. For this process to work, you must first ensure that someone has configured the services on the other origins to accept this custom header. Cross-origin resource sharing uses a variety of HTTP headers (both in the request and response). The header that specifically applies to New Relic is the Access-Control-Allow-Headers response header, which can include newrelic, traceparent, tracestate, or newrelic, traceparent, tracestate in its value depending on what tracing strategies you enabled in your APM-monitored application. You must configure your server to return this CORS header in its response. Example: Access-Control-Allow-Headers: newrelic, traceparent, tracestate Important New Relic cannot perform any validation to ensure the services on the other origins were configured correctly. If you're unsure about how to allow these headers, do not add cross-origin resources to the approved list in the New Relic UI. Enable cross-origin resource sharing Caution You should always try enabling CORS in a test environment before setting it up in production. To enable cross-origin resource sharing: Confirm that the services on the other origins are configured to accept the newrelic header using: Access-Control-Allow-Headers: newrelic, traceparent, tracestate (for details, see Risks and mitigations). Confirm that you meet the Browser monitoring requirements. Make sure you are in one.newrelic.com, and click Browser > (select an app) > Application settings. Turn on the Distributed tracing toggle if it's not already enabled. Turn on the Cross-origin resource sharing (CORS) toggle. Under Cross-origin resource sharing (CORS), add cross-origin resources to the approved list. Important Valid cross-origin resources must include: The prefix http:// or https:// The domain name The port number is not required unless it differs from the default for HTTP (port 80) or HTTPS (port 443). Select Save application settings to update the agent configuration. Redeploy the Browser agent (either restarting the associated APM agent or updating the copy/paste Browser installation). Find data Tips for finding and querying data: You can find end-user-originating traces in any New Relic One distributed tracing UI. In the distributed tracing UI, end-user spans are indicated with the icon. To see a span's attributes, select a span in the UI. Spans are reported as Span data, and can be queried in New Relic. Query tips: Query by browser app name by setting browserApp.name to the browser app name. Query for traces containing at least one browser app span with browserApp.name is not null. Query for traces containing at least one back-end app with appName is not null. Query for traces containing both browser and back-end spans by combining the two previous conditions. Troubleshooting If you don't see end-user spans, or are having other distributed tracing issues, see Troubleshooting.",

Make sure you have the minimum versions for your Browser, APM, and APM agents: Browser Pro + SPA, with distributed tracing enabled Browser agent version 1153 or higher Browser agent version 1158 or higher (required for cross-origin resource sharing) Browser agent version 1173 or higher (required for w3c trace context support) APM agent version: C SDK 1.3 or higher Java 5.9.0 or higher PHP 9.4.0 or higher Other APM agent version requirements Enable distributed tracing To enable distributed tracing for Browser monitoring: Make sure you meet requirements, including having: Full-Stack Observability Browser Pro with SPA enabled Go to one.newrelic.com, and click Browser > (select an app) > Settings > Application settings. Turn on the Distributed tracing toggle. By default, for agent version 1173 and above, the newrelic, traceparent, and tracestate headers will be added to all same-origin AJAX requests. Optional: If all of your services are configured to use the w3c trace context headers, you can choose to exclude the newrelic, traceparent, and tracestate headers from requests. Optional: Enable cross-origin resource sharing. Redeploy the Browser agent (either restarting the associated APM agent or updating the copy/paste Browser installation). Enable cross-origin resource sharing (CORS) If you have AJAX requests that need resources from different origins, you can enable cross-origin resource sharing (CORS). By default, distributed tracing for cross-origin requests is not enabled because of browser CORS security restrictions: Distributed tracing is implemented by adding a custom HTTP headers (newrelic, traceparent, and tracestate) to outgoing AJAX requests, and browsers typically do not allow custom headers on cross-origin requests. With the release of agent version 1173, we now support the w3c trace context headers (traceparent and tracestate) so these should also be allowed in your configuration. There are two separate configurations required to enable cross-origin distributed tracing: Configure the service on the different origin to accept the newrelic custom header Configure Browser monitoring to include the target origin in distributed tracing Our step-by-step instructions provide key concepts and steps to enable this feature, but if you need more background about how cross-origin resource sharing works, we recommend this Mozilla developer document. Risks and mitigations Caution Cross-origin resource sharing can expose you to a high level of risk if the services on the different origins are not configured correctly. The AJAX requests will likely return an error, resulting in a variety of failures, including: Resources failing to load (for example, images and key content) Login failures Entire site outages (depending on type of requests enabled) By enabling this cross-origin resource sharing feature, you are acknowledging the following: You understand that this feature is optional and not mandatory. You understand the steps you need to take in order to enable this feature for your services and your domains. You understand that if you do not properly configure your services prior to deployment (including but not limited to configuring your services on your domains to accept custom headers) portions or all of your website will likely malfunction. You understand that New Relic is neither responsible nor liable for errors or issues related to your misconfiguration of servers or services. You fully and solely accept the risks and wish to proceed. The best way to minimize your risk is to ensure you fully understand the process and to try it first in a test environment. Before reading the step-by-step instructions, it may help to first read this overview of the process: To use distributed tracing with cross-origin resources, you populate a list of approved cross-origin resources in New Relic, and then we automatically send the following custom headers to those resources: newrelic, traceparent, and tracestate. For this process to work, you must first ensure that someone has configured the services on the other origins to accept this custom header. Cross-origin resource sharing uses a variety of HTTP headers (both in the request and response). The header that specifically applies to New Relic is the Access-Control-Allow-Headers response header, which can include newrelic, traceparent, tracestate, or newrelic, traceparent, tracestate in its value depending on what tracing strategies you enabled in your APM-monitored application. You must configure your server to return this CORS header in its response. Example: Access-Control-Allow-Headers: newrelic, traceparent, tracestate Important New Relic cannot perform any validation to ensure the services on the other origins were configured correctly. If you're unsure about how to allow these headers, do not add cross-origin resources to the approved list in the New Relic UI. Enable cross-origin resource sharing Caution You should always try enabling CORS in a test environment before setting it up in production. To enable cross-origin resource sharing: Confirm that the services on the other origins are configured to accept the newrelic header using: Access-Control-Allow-Headers: newrelic, traceparent, tracestate (for details, see Risks and mitigations). Confirm that you meet the Browser monitoring requirements. Make sure you are in one.newrelic.com, and click Browser > (select an app) > Application settings. Turn on the Distributed tracing toggle if it's not already enabled. Turn on the Cross-origin resource sharing (CORS) toggle. Under Cross-origin resource sharing (CORS), add cross-origin resources to the approved list. Important Valid cross-origin resources must include: The prefix http:// or https:// The domain name The port number is not required unless it differs from the default for HTTP (port 80) or HTTPS (port 443). Select Save application settings to update the agent configuration. Redeploy the Browser agent (either restarting the associated APM agent or updating the copy/paste Browser installation). Find data Tips for finding and querying data: You can find end-user-originating traces in any New Relic One distributed tracing UI. In the distributed tracing UI, end-user spans are indicated with the icon. To see a span's attributes, select a span in the UI. Spans are reported as Span data, and can be queried in New Relic. Query tips: Query by browser app name by setting browserApp.name to the browser app name. Query for traces containing at least one browser app span with browserApp.name is not null. Query for traces containing at least one back-end app with appName is not null. Query for traces containing both browser and back-end spans by combining the two previous conditions. Troubleshooting If you don't see end-user spans, or are having other distributed tracing issues, see Troubleshooting.",

      "body": "Problem You're looking for performance breakdowns for specific pages or endpoints on the browser monitoring Page views UI page or AJAX UI page. The UI doesn't show the URL group you're looking for, or it only shows / and /*. This behavior also appears in SPA data in BrowserInteraction events and applies to browserInteractionName, targetGroupedUrl, and previousGroupedUrl attributes. Solution Browser monitoring automatically \"learns\" to group your page views when your application is first deployed, and it adds that information to an allow list for URLs. Sometimes this grouping may not match your current page view information. To solve this problem, manage your application's URL segment list settings by editing existing rules or by adding the domains and URL segments that make up your site's URLs. After you add the necessary rules, you should see a useful breakdown of your information in the UI. Here are some useful tips: Adding segments to your allow list Tip Use constant URL segments. Only add the URL segments that remain constant across many page views. Do not add unique segments such as IDs or highly-specific categories, because this can lead to metric grouping issues. Enter exact matches. Enter any URL segments as exact matches, including case. Use existing rules. If a rule already appears for a domain: Go to one.newrelic.com > Browser > (select an app) > Settings > Segment allow lists. Rather than creating a new rule, edit the existing rule, and add the domain to the UI's Allow listed segments field. Group sub-domains. Group similar sub-domains such as foo.domain.com and bar.domain.com under *.domain.com. This grouping must occur just before the top-level domain name. Set up single-page apps. If your site is a single-page application and you only see / under page views, then your grouping is working correctly. New Relic records subsequent requests as AJAX loads, and your AJAX page will contain more detailed information. If it doesn't, then follow the tips in this document. Remove rules when appropriate. If you need to remove a rule, get support at support.newrelic.com.",

To install the browser agent, you can choose from a number of deployment options. Tip To use Browser and the rest of our observability platform, join the New Relic family! Sign up to create your free account in only a few seconds. Then ingest up to 100GB of data for free each month. Forever. Select a deployment option No matter which option you use to deploy browser monitoring, the end result is to inject the browser agent's JavaScript snippet into your pages for browser monitoring. The method you select depends on your preferences and business needs. To view the procedure to install and enable the browser agent, click the link for the option you want to use. You can also use the Browser Application settings page to update settings. Important The following configuration options refer only to the browser monitoring agent. These are not the same as the New Relic user roles and editions. Browser deployment option Description Use the APM agent to inject the JavaScript You can use an APM agent to automatically inject the browser monitoring JavaScript snippet for you. This is the easiest way to install the agent for an app that already is being monitored by APM. (APM-monitored apps are listed on your APM Applications index.) Paste the JavaScript snippet into a webpage This allows you to control the exact placement of the JavaScript into your app's webpage(s) by copying and pasting the browser agent's JavaScript snippet. This is useful for: Standalone apps, static sites, and cached pages delivered by CDN APM apps that are not as closely coupled to the browser app as with a standard server-side app (for example, when your client-side app talks to a REST API back end) Enable single-page app (SPA) monitoring Enabling SPA requires a Pro + SPA browser agent subscription, and you may need to re-deploy the browser JavaScript agent. Use the REST API The REST API lets you manage deployment outside the browser UI. This is useful for large organizations deploying multiple apps. Use an APM agent API to manually instrument the JavaScript snippet For apps that are monitored by APM, you can use the APM agent's API to inject the JavaScript manually instead of automatically. Enable an APM-monitored app Use this procedure to automatically deploy the browser agent on an app that is monitored by APM: Go to one.newrelic.com, select Browser, and then select Add more data. In the Back-end, front-end, and mobile applications section, select the New Relic Browser tile. When prompted to select the account you want to add this instrumentation to, choose your account, and click Continue. From the Get started with New Relic Browser page, in the Choose a deployment method section, select Enable via New Relic APM. In the Choose your instrumentation section, select Lite, Pro, or Pro + SPA. In the Configure your instrumentation section, make the selections you want. In the Select your application section, type or use the search window to find an app's name. Click Enable. Important Node.js: To finish enabling the browser agent for a Node.js app, follow the additional procedure to insert the JavaScript header into the beginning of your HTML page's head tag. Generate some traffic for your app. Wait a few minutes for Browser to start collecting data, then select your app from the Browser applications index. Enable with copy/paste Use this procedure to insert browser's JavaScript snippet for browser monitoring into your app's webpages yourself. This option is useful for monitoring static sites (such as Jekyll) or cached pages delivered by CDN. Tip Near the bottom of the generated JavaScript is your browser license key and application ID. This is useful with the REST API and API Explorer. Go to one.newrelic.com, select Browser, and then select Add more data. In the Back-end, front-end, and mobile applications section, select the New Relic Browser tile. When prompted to select the account you want to add this instrumentation to, choose your account, and click Continue. From the Get started with New Relic Browser page, in the Choose a deployment method section, select Copy/Paste JavaScript Code. In the Choose your instrumentation section, select the type of agent: Lite, Pro, or Pro + SPA. In the Configure your instrumentation section, make the selections you want. In the Name your app section, name your app: If your app is monitored by APM, select Yes, then type or use the search window to find the app's name. If you have a standalone app for Browser (not monitored by APM), select No, then type the app's name. Click Enable. A new section, Instrument the agent, opens on the page with JavaScript code for your project. Copy the code snippet, then paste it inline into your pages as close to the top of the <head> element as possible, but after any position-sensitive <meta> tags (for example, X-UA-Compatible or charset information). For more information on the inline head placement, see JavaScript placement requirements. Generate some traffic for your app. Wait a few minutes for Browser to start collecting data, then select your app from the Browser applications index. If you use the copy/paste method, but don't finish the setup process, you can still view and copy the generated JavaScript snippet from your app's Browser Application settings page or by using the REST API (v2). Instrument webpages using the APM agent This information applies to apps that are also monitored by APM. New Relic's agents can instrument webpages with the required JavaScript for page load timing. If you use the APM agent to add the JavaScript snippet to your webpages, insert the instrumentation snippet as close to the top as possible. This allows you to take advantage of detailed information about browser's AJAX calls and JavaScript errors. For more information, see the instructions for your APM agent: C SDK Go Java .NET Node.js PHP Python Ruby Troubleshoot Browser agent installation When you enable browser Pro features for session traces, AJAX calls, or JavaScript errors, it may take approximately five minutes before information becomes available. If you have problems with your browser installation or if no data appears after five minutes, refer to the troubleshooting tips, and restart your agent.",

With the release of agent version 1173, we now support the w3c trace context headers (traceparent and tracestate) so these should also be allowed in your configuration. There are two separate configurations required to enable cross-origin distributed tracing: Configure the service on the different origin to accept the newrelic custom header Configure Browser monitoring to include the target origin in distributed tracing Our step-by-step instructions provide key concepts and steps to enable this feature, but if you need more background about how cross-origin resource sharing works, we recommend this Mozilla developer document. Risks and mitigations Caution Cross-origin resource sharing can expose you to a high level of risk if the services on the different origins are not configured correctly. The AJAX requests will likely return an error, resulting in a variety of failures, including: Resources failing to load (for example, images and key content) Login failures Entire site outages (depending on type of requests enabled) By enabling this cross-origin resource sharing feature, you are acknowledging the following: You understand that this feature is optional and not mandatory. You understand the steps you need to take in order to enable this feature for your services and your domains. You understand that if you do not properly configure your services prior to deployment (including but not limited to configuring your services on your domains to accept custom headers) portions or all of your website will likely malfunction. You understand that New Relic is neither responsible nor liable for errors or issues related to your misconfiguration of servers or services. You fully and solely accept the risks and wish to proceed. The best way to minimize your risk is to ensure you fully understand the process and to try it first in a test environment. Before reading the step-by-step instructions, it may help to first read this overview of the process: To use distributed tracing with cross-origin resources, you populate a list of approved cross-origin resources in New Relic, and then we automatically send the following custom headers to those resources: newrelic, traceparent, and tracestate. For this process to work, you must first ensure that someone has configured the services on the other origins to accept this custom header. Cross-origin resource sharing uses a variety of HTTP headers (both in the request and response). The header that specifically applies to New Relic is the Access-Control-Allow-Headers response header, which can include newrelic, traceparent, tracestate, or newrelic, traceparent, tracestate in its value depending on what tracing strategies you enabled in your APM-monitored application. You must configure your server to return this CORS header in its response. Example: Access-Control-Allow-Headers: newrelic, traceparent, tracestate Important New Relic cannot perform any validation to ensure the services on the other origins were configured correctly. If you're unsure about how to allow these headers, do not add cross-origin resources to the approved list in the New Relic UI. Enable cross-origin resource sharing Caution You should always try enabling CORS in a test environment before setting it up in production. To enable cross-origin resource sharing: Confirm that the services on the other origins are configured to accept the newrelic header using: Access-Control-Allow-Headers: newrelic, traceparent, tracestate (for details, see Risks and mitigations). Confirm that you meet the Browser monitoring requirements. Make sure you are in one.newrelic.com, and click Browser > (select an app) > Application settings. Turn on the Distributed tracing toggle if it's not already enabled. Turn on the Cross-origin resource sharing (CORS) toggle. Under Cross-origin resource sharing (CORS), add cross-origin resources to the approved list. Important Valid cross-origin resources must include: The prefix http:// or https:// The domain name The port number is not required unless it differs from the default for HTTP (port 80) or HTTPS (port 443). Select Save application settings to update the agent configuration. Redeploy the Browser agent (either restarting the associated APM agent or updating the copy/paste Browser installation). Find data Tips for finding and querying data: You can find end-user-originating traces in any New Relic One distributed tracing UI. In the distributed tracing UI, end-user spans are indicated with the icon. To see a span's attributes, select a span in the UI. Spans are reported as Span data, and can be queried in New Relic. Query tips: Query by browser app name by setting browserApp.name to the browser app name. Query for traces containing at least one browser app span with browserApp.name is not null. Query for traces containing at least one back-end app with appName is not null. Query for traces containing both browser and back-end spans by combining the two previous conditions. Troubleshooting If you don't see end-user spans, or are having other distributed tracing issues, see Troubleshooting.",

      "body": "Browser uses a JavaScript snippet (or \"agent\") to instrument your app's webpages. The JavaScript collects data for browser monitoring. To install the browser agent, you can choose from a number of deployment options. Tip To use Browser and the rest of our observability platform, join the New Relic family! Sign up to create your free account in only a few seconds. Then ingest up to 100GB of data for free each month. Forever. Select a deployment option No matter which option you use to deploy browser monitoring, the end result is to inject the browser agent's JavaScript snippet into your pages for browser monitoring. The method you select depends on your preferences and business needs. To view the procedure to install and enable the browser agent, click the link for the option you want to use. You can also use the Browser Application settings page to update settings. Important The following configuration options refer only to the browser monitoring agent. These are not the same as the New Relic user roles and editions. Browser deployment option Description Use the APM agent to inject the JavaScript You can use an APM agent to automatically inject the browser monitoring JavaScript snippet for you. This is the easiest way to install the agent for an app that already is being monitored by APM. (APM-monitored apps are listed on your APM Applications index.) Paste the JavaScript snippet into a webpage This allows you to control the exact placement of the JavaScript into your app's webpage(s) by copying and pasting the browser agent's JavaScript snippet. This is useful for: Standalone apps, static sites, and cached pages delivered by CDN APM apps that are not as closely coupled to the browser app as with a standard server-side app (for example, when your client-side app talks to a REST API back end) Enable single-page app (SPA) monitoring Enabling SPA requires a Pro + SPA browser agent subscription, and you may need to re-deploy the browser JavaScript agent. Use the REST API The REST API lets you manage deployment outside the browser UI. This is useful for large organizations deploying multiple apps. Use an APM agent API to manually instrument the JavaScript snippet For apps that are monitored by APM, you can use the APM agent's API to inject the JavaScript manually instead of automatically. Enable an APM-monitored app Use this procedure to automatically deploy the browser agent on an app that is monitored by APM: Go to one.newrelic.com, select Browser, and then select Add more data. In the Back-end, front-end, and mobile applications section, select the New Relic Browser tile. When prompted to select the account you want to add this instrumentation to, choose your account, and click Continue. From the Get started with New Relic Browser page, in the Choose a deployment method section, select Enable via New Relic APM. In the Choose your instrumentation section, select Lite, Pro, or Pro + SPA. In the Configure your instrumentation section, make the selections you want. In the Select your application section, type or use the search window to find an app's name. Click Enable. Important Node.js: To finish enabling the browser agent for a Node.js app, follow the additional procedure to insert the JavaScript header into the beginning of your HTML page's head tag. Generate some traffic for your app. Wait a few minutes for Browser to start collecting data, then select your app from the Browser applications index. Enable with copy/paste Use this procedure to insert browser's JavaScript snippet for browser monitoring into your app's webpages yourself. This option is useful for monitoring static sites (such as Jekyll) or cached pages delivered by CDN. Tip Near the bottom of the generated JavaScript is your browser license key and application ID. This is useful with the REST API and API Explorer. Go to one.newrelic.com, select Browser, and then select Add more data. In the Back-end, front-end, and mobile applications section, select the New Relic Browser tile. When prompted to select the account you want to add this instrumentation to, choose your account, and click Continue. From the Get started with New Relic Browser page, in the Choose a deployment method section, select Copy/Paste JavaScript Code. In the Choose your instrumentation section, select the type of agent: Lite, Pro, or Pro + SPA. In the Configure your instrumentation section, make the selections you want. In the Name your app section, name your app: If your app is monitored by APM, select Yes, then type or use the search window to find the app's name. If you have a standalone app for Browser (not monitored by APM), select No, then type the app's name. Click Enable. A new section, Instrument the agent, opens on the page with JavaScript code for your project. Copy the code snippet, then paste it inline into your pages as close to the top of the <head> element as possible, but after any position-sensitive <meta> tags (for example, X-UA-Compatible or charset information). For more information on the inline head placement, see JavaScript placement requirements. Generate some traffic for your app. Wait a few minutes for Browser to start collecting data, then select your app from the Browser applications index. If you use the copy/paste method, but don't finish the setup process, you can still view and copy the generated JavaScript snippet from your app's Browser Application settings page or by using the REST API (v2). Instrument webpages using the APM agent This information applies to apps that are also monitored by APM. New Relic's agents can instrument webpages with the required JavaScript for page load timing. If you use the APM agent to add the JavaScript snippet to your webpages, insert the instrumentation snippet as close to the top as possible. This allows you to take advantage of detailed information about browser's AJAX calls and JavaScript errors. For more information, see the instructions for your APM agent: C SDK Go Java .NET Node.js PHP Python Ruby Troubleshoot Browser agent installation When you enable browser Pro features for session traces, AJAX calls, or JavaScript errors, it may take approximately five minutes before information becomes available. If you have problems with your browser installation or if no data appears after five minutes, refer to the troubleshooting tips, and restart your agent.",

      "body": "Running the latest version of Browser monitoring ensures you can access all Browser features and enhancements. To update to the latest version, check your version number, then follow the steps to update an APM-managed installation or to upgrade a copy/paste installation. Check your version number To verify your Browser version number: View the source code of a page which includes the JavaScript snippet. Search the page source for js-agent.newrelic.com/nr-. The numbers that follow nr- are your current version. For example, js-agent.newrelic.com/nr-593.min.js indicates you are running version 593 of the Browser script. The Pro+SPA agent will have the format js-agent.newrelic.com/nr-spa-1184.min.js To verify the latest version of the Browser script loader: Go to js-agent.newrelic.com/nr-loader-full-current.min.js . Search for js-agent.newrelic.com/nr-, then note the numbers that follow nr-. If the latest version number is higher than the number of the version you are currently running, update your Browser agent. Check deployment method Your Browser agent may have been deployed using the copy/paste method rather than injected with APM. To check which deployment method was used, run this command in the JavaScript console: > newrelic.info.sa Copy If the command returns 1, then your Browser agent used the copy/paste method. Update your APM-managed installation To update your APM-managed Browser installation, restart your APM agent. Your app will automatically update to the latest JavaScript snippet. To ensure the new script registers, you may need to clear your cache. For more information, follow the troubleshooting procedures to manually check and clear the cache. Update your copy/paste installation Use any of the following options to access the Browser JavaScript snippet needed to update a copy/paste installation. After accessing the snippet, be sure to replace all of your existing snippet with the new version. If you have a standalone installation with a few applications, you can retrieve the snippet from the UI, and then replace it with the new version. If you have many applications, you can use the REST API or the loader endpoint to automate the update process. Caution Do not simply change the version number in the existing snippet. This can result in incomplete data collection. For best results after you use any of the following options, always update the agent. Retrieve the snippet from the UI Download the latest version of the snippet: Go to one.newrelic.com > Browser > (select an app) > Application settings. This option is only available for standalone installations. Extract the snippet with the REST API To update the snippet using the New Relic REST API, follow the process for viewing a specific Browser app. The loader_script attribute in your response will include the latest JavaScript snippet. This may be a good solution if you have many applications to manage, or if your Browser app is linked to an APM app. Update using the loader endpoint To update the snippet from the New Relic loader endpoint, use the Browser Pro + SPA endpoint, the Browser Pro endpoint, or the Browser Lite endpoint. These endpoints always point to the latest version of the script snippet. Recommendation: Use the Browser Pro or Pro + SPA loaders regardless of your Browser subscription level. These loaders are compatible with both the Pro and Lite subscription levels. These loader endpoints are generic and do not include your specific configuration data. To add your configuration data to the loaders: Find your Browser application ID and license key: Follow standard procedures to use the New Relic UI or the REST API. Set your Browser application ID and license key immediately after the snippet. NREUM.info = { applicationID: \"YOUR-APPLICATION-ID\", licenseKey: \"YOUR-BROWSER-LICENSE-KEY\" }; Copy",

To update to the latest version, check your version number, then follow the steps to update an APM-managed installation or to upgrade a copy/paste installation. Check your version number To verify your Browser version number: View the source code of a page which includes the JavaScript snippet. Search the page source for js-agent.newrelic.com/nr-. The numbers that follow nr- are your current version. For example, js-agent.newrelic.com/nr-593.min.js indicates you are running version 593 of the Browser script. The Pro+SPA agent will have the format js-agent.newrelic.com/nr-spa-1184.min.js To verify the latest version of the Browser script loader: Go to js-agent.newrelic.com/nr-loader-full-current.min.js . Search for js-agent.newrelic.com/nr-, then note the numbers that follow nr-. If the latest version number is higher than the number of the version you are currently running, update your Browser agent. Check deployment method Your Browser agent may have been deployed using the copy/paste method rather than injected with APM. To check which deployment method was used, run this command in the JavaScript console: > newrelic.info.sa Copy If the command returns 1, then your Browser agent used the copy/paste method. Update your APM-managed installation To update your APM-managed Browser installation, restart your APM agent. Your app will automatically update to the latest JavaScript snippet. To ensure the new script registers, you may need to clear your cache. For more information, follow the troubleshooting procedures to manually check and clear the cache. Update your copy/paste installation Use any of the following options to access the Browser JavaScript snippet needed to update a copy/paste installation. After accessing the snippet, be sure to replace all of your existing snippet with the new version. If you have a standalone installation with a few applications, you can retrieve the snippet from the UI, and then replace it with the new version. If you have many applications, you can use the REST API or the loader endpoint to automate the update process. Caution Do not simply change the version number in the existing snippet. This can result in incomplete data collection. For best results after you use any of the following options, always update the agent. Retrieve the snippet from the UI Download the latest version of the snippet: Go to one.newrelic.com > Browser > (select an app) > Application settings. This option is only available for standalone installations. Extract the snippet with the REST API To update the snippet using the New Relic REST API, follow the process for viewing a specific Browser app. The loader_script attribute in your response will include the latest JavaScript snippet. This may be a good solution if you have many applications to manage, or if your Browser app is linked to an APM app. Update using the loader endpoint To update the snippet from the New Relic loader endpoint, use the Browser Pro + SPA endpoint, the Browser Pro endpoint, or the Browser Lite endpoint. These endpoints always point to the latest version of the script snippet. Recommendation: Use the Browser Pro or Pro + SPA loaders regardless of your Browser subscription level. These loaders are compatible with both the Pro and Lite subscription levels. These loader endpoints are generic and do not include your specific configuration data. To add your configuration data to the loaders: Find your Browser application ID and license key: Follow standard procedures to use the New Relic UI or the REST API. Set your Browser application ID and license key immediately after the snippet. NREUM.info = { applicationID: \"YOUR-APPLICATION-ID\", licenseKey: \"YOUR-BROWSER-LICENSE-KEY\" }; Copy",

This document contains: Benefits of this feature Requirements Enable distributed tracing Enable cross-origin resource sharing (CORS) Find and query data Troubleshooting Tip Browser data is available in standard distributed tracing only, not Infinite Tracing. Benefits of browser data in distributed tracing By enabling New Relic to report browser data to distributed tracing, you can see the connection between front-end activity and back-end activity. You can see across a full transaction, from time spent by an end user in the web browser, to network activity, to associated back-end services. Benefits of this feature: Quickly spot latencies, errors, and anomalies in the browser or network Resolve customer-facing problems more quickly All the benefits of distributed tracing applied to your end-user monitoring Requirements and compatibility This feature reports AJAX requests (Fetch and XHR) that occur during a browser interaction. By default, only single-origin requests are monitored unless cross-origin resource sharing is enabled. Make sure you have the minimum versions for your Browser, APM, and APM agents: Browser Pro + SPA, with distributed tracing enabled Browser agent version 1153 or higher Browser agent version 1158 or higher (required for cross-origin resource sharing) Browser agent version 1173 or higher (required for w3c trace context support) APM agent version: C SDK 1.3 or higher Java 5.9.0 or higher PHP 9.4.0 or higher Other APM agent version requirements Enable distributed tracing To enable distributed tracing for Browser monitoring: Make sure you meet requirements, including having: Full-Stack Observability Browser Pro with SPA enabled Go to one.newrelic.com, and click Browser > (select an app) > Settings > Application settings. Turn on the Distributed tracing toggle. By default, for agent version 1173 and above, the newrelic, traceparent, and tracestate headers will be added to all same-origin AJAX requests. Optional: If all of your services are configured to use the w3c trace context headers, you can choose to exclude the newrelic, traceparent, and tracestate headers from requests. Optional: Enable cross-origin resource sharing. Redeploy the Browser agent (either restarting the associated APM agent or updating the copy/paste Browser installation). Enable cross-origin resource sharing (CORS) If you have AJAX requests that need resources from different origins, you can enable cross-origin resource sharing (CORS). By default, distributed tracing for cross-origin requests is not enabled because of browser CORS security restrictions: Distributed tracing is implemented by adding a custom HTTP headers (newrelic, traceparent, and tracestate) to outgoing AJAX requests, and browsers typically do not allow custom headers on cross-origin requests. With the release of agent version 1173, we now support the w3c trace context headers (traceparent and tracestate) so these should also be allowed in your configuration. There are two separate configurations required to enable cross-origin distributed tracing: Configure the service on the different origin to accept the newrelic custom header Configure Browser monitoring to include the target origin in distributed tracing Our step-by-step instructions provide key concepts and steps to enable this feature, but if you need more background about how cross-origin resource sharing works, we recommend this Mozilla developer document. Risks and mitigations Caution Cross-origin resource sharing can expose you to a high level of risk if the services on the different origins are not configured correctly. The AJAX requests will likely return an error, resulting in a variety of failures, including: Resources failing to load (for example, images and key content) Login failures Entire site outages (depending on type of requests enabled) By enabling this cross-origin resource sharing feature, you are acknowledging the following: You understand that this feature is optional and not mandatory. You understand the steps you need to take in order to enable this feature for your services and your domains. You understand that if you do not properly configure your services prior to deployment (including but not limited to configuring your services on your domains to accept custom headers) portions or all of your website will likely malfunction. You understand that New Relic is neither responsible nor liable for errors or issues related to your misconfiguration of servers or services. You fully and solely accept the risks and wish to proceed. The best way to minimize your risk is to ensure you fully understand the process and to try it first in a test environment. Before reading the step-by-step instructions, it may help to first read this overview of the process: To use distributed tracing with cross-origin resources, you populate a list of approved cross-origin resources in New Relic, and then we automatically send the following custom headers to those resources: newrelic, traceparent, and tracestate. For this process to work, you must first ensure that someone has configured the services on the other origins to accept this custom header. Cross-origin resource sharing uses a variety of HTTP headers (both in the request and response). The header that specifically applies to New Relic is the Access-Control-Allow-Headers response header, which can include newrelic, traceparent, tracestate, or newrelic, traceparent, tracestate in its value depending on what tracing strategies you enabled in your APM-monitored application. You must configure your server to return this CORS header in its response. Example: Access-Control-Allow-Headers: newrelic, traceparent, tracestate Important New Relic cannot perform any validation to ensure the services on the other origins were configured correctly. If you're unsure about how to allow these headers, do not add cross-origin resources to the approved list in the New Relic UI. Enable cross-origin resource sharing Caution You should always try enabling CORS in a test environment before setting it up in production. To enable cross-origin resource sharing: Confirm that the services on the other origins are configured to accept the newrelic header using: Access-Control-Allow-Headers: newrelic, traceparent, tracestate (for details, see Risks and mitigations). Confirm that you meet the Browser monitoring requirements. Make sure you are in one.newrelic.com, and click Browser > (select an app) > Application settings. Turn on the Distributed tracing toggle if it's not already enabled. Turn on the Cross-origin resource sharing (CORS) toggle. Under Cross-origin resource sharing (CORS), add cross-origin resources to the approved list. Important Valid cross-origin resources must include: The prefix http:// or https:// The domain name The port number is not required unless it differs from the default for HTTP (port 80) or HTTPS (port 443). Select Save application settings to update the agent configuration. Redeploy the Browser agent (either restarting the associated APM agent or updating the copy/paste Browser installation). Find data Tips for finding and querying data: You can find end-user-originating traces in any New Relic One distributed tracing UI. In the distributed tracing UI, end-user spans are indicated with the icon. To see a span's attributes, select a span in the UI. Spans are reported as Span data, and can be queried in New Relic. Query tips: Query by browser app name by setting browserApp.name to the browser app name. Query for traces containing at least one browser app span with browserApp.name is not null. Query for traces containing at least one back-end app with appName is not null. Query for traces containing both browser and back-end spans by combining the two previous conditions. Troubleshooting If you don't see end-user spans, or are having other distributed tracing issues, see Troubleshooting.",

Compatibility and requirements This private beta is closed. This feature and all related services will be deprecated in July 2021. In addition to browser monitoring's installation requirements, Browser's AMP agent requires: Browser AMP requirements Comments New Relic Browser New Relic's browser requirements include Browser Pro account, which includes access to New Relic Insights data depending on your Browser subscription level. Browser app ID To capture AMP throughput, browser monitoring needs the app ID for each app: Go to one.newrelic.com > Browser and select an application from the index. Copy the numeric value that follows /browser/1234567890 in the URL. Browser monitoring license key To obtain only the browser monitoring license key: Go to one.newrelic.com > Browser > Settings. Select and copy the generated JavaScript, and paste it into a text file. Delete everything in the text file except the browser monitoring license key (just above the ending </script> tag), and save. Install Browser's AMP agent New Relic has partnered with The Amp Project to incorporate New Relic Browser's AMP agent in with the AMP Analytics repo. Before installing, read the requirements. To install the Browser AMP agent into your AMP app: Add the attribute newrelic to your AMP analytics code. For more information, see the AMP site. Add the browser app ID and license key. To send data from one AMP page to multiple Browser apps, include quote marks and a comma to separate each Browser app ID. For example: \"appId\": [\"123\", \"124\", \"125\"] <amp-analytics type=\"newrelic\" id=\"newrelic\"> <script type=\"application/json\"> { \"vars\": { \"appId\": \"\", \"licenseKey\": \"\" } } </script> </amp-analytics> Copy Query AMP events Currently, your AMP data will not appear in the New Relic's browser monitoring UI. This is intentional; any AMP data sent to the New Relic collector will be removed automatically from your browser monitoring metrics. In the meantime, you can run NRQL queries to compare your AMP page to non-AMP pages. The dashboard data provides standard performance key metrics. New Relic stores AMP events in the PageView and BrowserInteraction events. To view the AMP events, run the following NRQL queries: SELECT * FROM BrowserInteraction WHERE mobileOptimized = 'amp' SELECT * FROM PageView WHERE mobileOptimized = 'amp' Here's an example of a dashboard showing AMP event data after you install New Relic Browser's AMP JavaScript snippet into the body of your AMP pages.

      "body": "Browser monitoring's PageViewTiming event sends each data point as a separate event as soon as it is available. Because we do not restrict the timing, you can receive first paint or first interaction data regardless of when it fires. This document describes why and how to use PageViewTiming and its attributes to query data about your site, component loading, and user performance metrics, both from visual and responsiveness standpoints. Why use PageViewTiming? If your application uses asynchronous or dynamic pages, you may need additional details about site or component loading. But pages can load content in many different ways, and users control when they interact with that content. This is why some user-centric performance metrics happen outside the standard window onload (page load time) in the Browser agent. For example, users may become impatient and begin clicking as soon as content is on the webpage. Or, they may wait to use the page until long after content is loaded. The PageViewTiming event provides a more real-time delivery mechanism that does not have a dependency on any other event. The additional metrics can help you understand how users experience your site, both from visual and responsiveness standpoints. Support for Google's Core Web Vitals We now, with the release of agent version 1177, have full support for Google's Core Web Vitals for 2020. The metrics that make up Core Web Vitals will evolve over time. The current set for 2020 focuses on three aspects of the user experience—loading, interactivity, and visual stability—and includes the following metrics (and their respective thresholds): Core Web Vitals metrics include loading, interactivity, and visual stability. Largest Contentful Paint (LCP): measures loading performance. To provide a good user experience, LCP should occur within 2.5 seconds of when the page first starts loading. First Input Delay (FID): measures interactivity. To provide a good user experience, pages should have a FID of less than 100 milliseconds. Cumulative Layout Shift (CLS): measures visual stability. To provide a good user experience, pages should maintain a CLS of less than 0.1. For each of the above metrics, to ensure you're hitting the recommended target for most of your users, a good threshold to measure is the 75th percentile of page loads, segmented across mobile and desktop devices. To learn more, watch our Nerd Days talk on perceived performance. Detailed visual, interactivity, and responsiveness metrics The BrowserInteraction and PageView events end their reporting when they receive the page window load (or window load and AJAX) timing. However, paint and interactivity metrics can happen at any time. PageViewTiming delivers these metrics as a separate event to: Account for the variability in this timing. Avoid setting an arbitrary timeout. Prevent holding BrowserInteraction and PageView events indefinitely. Additional data Comments firstPaint and firstContentfulPaint The firstPaint and firstContentfulPaint attributes already are available with BrowserInteraction and PageView events. However, they are not always reliably captured before the window onload event fires. Using PageViewTiming gives you a way to capture these metrics even if they happen after the original page load time. This gives you a better understanding of the correlation between responsiveness of that load event and the visual rendering of your content. largestContentfulPaint This new metric, available with agent version 1163, largestContentfulPaint, reports the render time of the largest content element visible in the viewport. Google's research found looking at when the largest element was rendered was a more accurate way to measure when the main content of a page is loaded and useful. Details on this metric, including limitations and considerations can be found in the w3c draft. In addition, we now report the cumulative layout shift (CLS) score attribute with LCP. This attribute is reported as cumulativeLayoutShift. Largest Contentful Paint is one of three metrics identified by Google as the Core Web Vitals. LCP values up to 2.5 secs are considered \"Good\", between 2.5-4.0 secs considered \"Needs Improvement\", and above 4.0 secs considered \"Poor.\" firstInteraction and firstInputDelay With the addition of firstInteraction and firstInputDelay, you can quickly determine the ways that your users are interacting with that visual content. These metrics tell you not only when they interacted, but what type of interaction (mousedown, pointerdown, etc.) and how long it took for them to receive a response from your site. The firstInputDelay metric lies in the middle of FirstContentfulPaint and Time to Interactive (TTI) metrics, measuring the time between when a first input can be made and when the browser's main thread is able to respond to any interactions. In addition, we now report the cumulative layout shift (CLS) score attribute at the moment of the user's first interaction. This attribute is reported as cumulativeLayoutShift. First Input Delay is one of three metrics identified by Google as the Core Web Vitals. FID values up to 100 ms are considered \"Good\", between 100-300 ms considered \"Needs Improvement\", and above 300 ms considered \"Poor.\" For a more detailed explanation, see the Browser release notes. cumulativeLayoutShift Cumulative Layout Shift (CLS), available with agent v1177, is an important, user-centric metric for measuring visual stability because it helps quantify how often users experience unexpected layout shifts—a low CLS helps ensure that the page is delightful. This is one of three metrics identified by Google as the Core Web Vitals. Cumulative Layout Shift is one of three metrics identified by Google as the Core Web Vitals. CLS scores up to 0.1 are considered \"Good\", between 0.1-0.25 considered \"Needs Improvement\", and above 0.25 considered \"Poor.\" timingName You can review different types of activities with the timingName attribute, such as firstPaint, firstContentfulPaint, firstInteraction, largestContentfulPaint, pageHide and windowUnload. For example, a PageViewTiming event may have a timingName of firstPaint and a firstPaint value of .03. The event will also include all default attributes included with the standard BrowserInteraction and PageView events. elementId This is the Id, if specified, of the largestContentfulPaint element. This value will only be reported with the LCP metric. This value can be null. elementSize This is the reported size of the largestContentfulPaint element. This value will only be reported with the LCP metric. pageHide The pageHide event, available with agent v1177, is sent when the browser hides the current page in the process of presenting a different page from the session's history. For example, when the user clicks the browser's Back button, the current page receives a pageHide event before the previous page is shown. Supporting documentation and browser compatibility for the pageHide event can be found in MDN docs. In addition, we now report the cumulative layout shift (CLS) score attribute with pageHide. This attribute is reported as cumulativeLayoutShift. windowLoad The windowLoad event, available with agent v1177, is fired when the whole page has loaded, including all dependent resources such as stylesheets and images. Supporting documentation and browser compatibility for the Window Load event can be found in MDN docs. In addition, we now report the cumulative layout shift (CLS) score attribute with windowLoad. This attribute is reported as cumulativeLayoutShift. windowUnload The windowUnload event, available with agent v1163, is fired when a document or child resource is being unloaded. Supporting documentation and browser compatibility for the Window Unload event can be found in MDN docs. In addition, we now report the cumulative layout shift (CLS) score attribute with windowUnload. This attribute is reported as cumulativeLayoutShift. Compatibility and requirements In addition to Browser's installation requirements, the PageViewTiming event requires Browser agent version 1153 or higher and a Browser Pro subscription. Follow our Browser agent release notes to find out when new metrics are released. These metrics are supported by the following browser versions. For unsupported browsers, no PageViewTiming events will be recorded. Metrics Supported browser versions cumulativeLayoutShift Chrome 79 Metric is elevated to stable; changes in metric definition will be reported in this log. Chrome 77 Metric exposed via API: Cumulative Layout Shift available via Layout Instability API firstPaint firstContentfulPaint Chrome 60 or higher for desktop and mobile (Android webview and Chrome for Android) Opera 47 or higher for desktop Opera 44 or higher for Android mobile Samsung Internet for mobile largestContentfulPaint Chrome 77 or higher for desktop and mobile firstInteraction firstInputDelay These metrics require the addEventListener Browser API. This API is available in all modern browsers, including: Apple Safari Google Chrome Microsoft Internet Explorer (IE) versions 9 or higher Mozilla Firefox pageHide This metric is currently supported by all browsers on desktop and mobile.

      "body": "This document describes data privacy related to Browser monitoring and cookies, and details about the cookies themselves. Page load timing (sometimes referred to as real user monitoring or RUM) creates the following cookies that Browser monitoring uses when session tracking in end-user browsers. Tip These cookies are related to Browser app monitoring. For more information about data privacy and requesting data to be deleted, see New Relic personal data requests. Data privacy and legal compliance The default Browser agent configuration does not retain any personal data as defined by common privacy laws such as the EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA). New Relic has taken steps to enable our customers who elect to process personal data in our products to do so in accordance with applicable privacy laws. Use the additional information below to help enable your compliance with such laws: Data Description IP addresses New Relic briefly collects and leverages the IP address from the end-user as part of the data collection process. The IP is captured when a connection is made between the end user's browser and the New Relic data collector. The IP address is included in the web request, much like a caller ID. New Relic uses the IP, much like you see a phone number when somebody calls you. The IP address is used as a lookup value that maps to additional details, allowing New Relic customers to diagnose performance issues. IP address lookup values include: countryCode regionCode city asn (Autonomous System Number) asnOrganization (ISP/Business/Institution) asnLatitude asnLongitude The mapping process for the IP address lookup value is typically complete within minutes, but in some extreme cases may take up to 24 hours to process. Once the mapping process is complete, New Relic no longer retains the IP address. Default cookies The Browser monitoring agent sets cookies by default. Cookies are placed by the Browser agent and the New Relic collector. The New Relic collector places a cookie when the Browser agent makes a connection and transmits data. A cookie consent manager that uses a conditional script loader that only loads tags/snippets when a visitor agrees to a specific type of cookies can be used. By choosing this option there is a risk that page performance will not be captured until the visitor has agreed and the Browser agent is running. With the release of Browser agent v1169, you can turn off cookie collection (JSESSIONID and NREUM) for your Browser app by using the Application settings page in the New Relic UI. Once this configuration value is set to false (OFF), you will no longer see the session information in your event data. By default, the value is set to true (ON) for all existing Browser apps as well as newly created ones. For more information, see our documentation about cookie collection and session tracking. Personal data through custom Browser configuration New Relic offers the option to manually configure your agent through the Browser monitoring API. This could be used to capture personal data, subject to the restrictions set forth in the Terms of Service with New Relic. (For example, no credit card numbers or sensitive categories of personal data, which are contractually prohibited.) New Relic responds to the instructions specified by the agents, including collecting personal data that may be custom configured. If you (as the data controller) receive a request from one of your own customers and determine that personal data sent to New Relic for processing must be deleted, see New Relic personal data requests. JSESSIONID The JSESSIONID cookie is used to store a session identifier so that New Relic can monitor session counts for an application. The cookie value is generated by Jetty. Components Description Session identifier This is used by New Relic to monitor session counts for an application. Domain The JSESSIONID cookie is associated with the New Relic domain. Expiration JSESSIONID is a session cookie that is deleted when the browser closes. NREUM This cookie is only created in browsers that do not support the Navigation Timing API. When a browser supports the Navigation Timing API, a native interface can be used to determine navigation start time. Mozilla Firefox versions 7 or higher support the Navigation Timing API. However, a bug exists in Firefox's early implementations of the Navigation Timing API that Browser monitoring works around by using this cookie. Components Description Navigation start time Navigation start time is required to measure end user response time. The cookie is written when the current page unloads (as the next navigation begins). Document location Stored as a hash. The document location is used with the referring page URL to validate that the start time refers to the page that was previously being viewed or refreshed (to avoid using an invalid start time from a different navigation). Referring page URLs Stored as a hash. The referring page URL is used with the document location to validate that the start time refers to the page that was previously being viewed or refreshed (to avoid using an invalid start time from a different navigation). Domain The NREUM cookie is associated with the root path of the domain in which the New Relic agent executes. Expiration NREUM is a session cookie that is deleted when the browser closes. NRAGENT The NRAGENT cookie is set only if you use Browser agent version v443 or lower. It is created when a token is handed out to an end user by the New Relic collector. End-user metrics are communicated to New Relic collectors via a JSONP request from the browser (script retrieval). The returned JavaScript contains a call to set the token identifier which is written to the cookie on the next navigation (when the page unloads). This achieves a cross-domain communication between the New Relic collector and the New Relic agent. This cookie is used to communicate between the New Relic collector aggregating end user metrics and the agent(s) running in the associated web application. A token identifies and correlates application tier transaction traces with corresponding browser traces. Components Description Token identifier The 16-character token identifier helps with cross-domain communication between the New Relic collector and the New Relic agent.

      "body": "Browser monitoring's PageViewTiming event sends each data point as a separate event as soon as it is available. Because we do not restrict the timing, you can receive first paint or first interaction data regardless of when it fires. This document describes why and how to use PageViewTiming and its attributes to query data about your site, component loading, and user performance metrics, both from visual and responsiveness standpoints. Why use PageViewTiming? If your application uses asynchronous or dynamic pages, you may need additional details about site or component loading. But pages can load content in many different ways, and users control when they interact with that content. This is why some user-centric performance metrics happen outside the standard window onload (page load time) in the Browser agent. For example, users may become impatient and begin clicking as soon as content is on the webpage. Or, they may wait to use the page until long after content is loaded. The PageViewTiming event provides a more real-time delivery mechanism that does not have a dependency on any other event. The additional metrics can help you understand how users experience your site, both from visual and responsiveness standpoints. Support for Google's Core Web Vitals We now, with the release of agent version 1177, have full support for Google's Core Web Vitals for 2020. The metrics that make up Core Web Vitals will evolve over time. The current set for 2020 focuses on three aspects of the user experience—loading, interactivity, and visual stability—and includes the following metrics (and their respective thresholds): Core Web Vitals metrics include loading, interactivity, and visual stability. Largest Contentful Paint (LCP): measures loading performance. To provide a good user experience, LCP should occur within 2.5 seconds of when the page first starts loading. First Input Delay (FID): measures interactivity. To provide a good user experience, pages should have a FID of less than 100 milliseconds. Cumulative Layout Shift (CLS): measures visual stability. To provide a good user experience, pages should maintain a CLS of less than 0.1. For each of the above metrics, to ensure you're hitting the recommended target for most of your users, a good threshold to measure is the 75th percentile of page loads, segmented across mobile and desktop devices. To learn more, watch our Nerd Days talk on perceived performance. Detailed visual, interactivity, and responsiveness metrics The BrowserInteraction and PageView events end their reporting when they receive the page window load (or window load and AJAX) timing. However, paint and interactivity metrics can happen at any time. PageViewTiming delivers these metrics as a separate event to: Account for the variability in this timing. Avoid setting an arbitrary timeout. Prevent holding BrowserInteraction and PageView events indefinitely. Additional data Comments firstPaint and firstContentfulPaint The firstPaint and firstContentfulPaint attributes already are available with BrowserInteraction and PageView events. However, they are not always reliably captured before the window onload event fires. Using PageViewTiming gives you a way to capture these metrics even if they happen after the original page load time. This gives you a better understanding of the correlation between responsiveness of that load event and the visual rendering of your content. largestContentfulPaint This new metric, available with agent version 1163, largestContentfulPaint, reports the render time of the largest content element visible in the viewport. Google's research found looking at when the largest element was rendered was a more accurate way to measure when the main content of a page is loaded and useful. Details on this metric, including limitations and considerations can be found in the w3c draft. In addition, we now report the cumulative layout shift (CLS) score attribute with LCP. This attribute is reported as cumulativeLayoutShift. Largest Contentful Paint is one of three metrics identified by Google as the Core Web Vitals. LCP values up to 2.5 secs are considered \"Good\", between 2.5-4.0 secs considered \"Needs Improvement\", and above 4.0 secs considered \"Poor.\" firstInteraction and firstInputDelay With the addition of firstInteraction and firstInputDelay, you can quickly determine the ways that your users are interacting with that visual content. These metrics tell you not only when they interacted, but what type of interaction (mousedown, pointerdown, etc.) and how long it took for them to receive a response from your site. The firstInputDelay metric lies in the middle of FirstContentfulPaint and Time to Interactive (TTI) metrics, measuring the time between when a first input can be made and when the browser's main thread is able to respond to any interactions. In addition, we now report the cumulative layout shift (CLS) score attribute at the moment of the user's first interaction. This attribute is reported as cumulativeLayoutShift. First Input Delay is one of three metrics identified by Google as the Core Web Vitals. FID values up to 100 ms are considered \"Good\", between 100-300 ms considered \"Needs Improvement\", and above 300 ms considered \"Poor.\" For a more detailed explanation, see the Browser release notes. cumulativeLayoutShift Cumulative Layout Shift (CLS), available with agent v1177, is an important, user-centric metric for measuring visual stability because it helps quantify how often users experience unexpected layout shifts—a low CLS helps ensure that the page is delightful. This is one of three metrics identified by Google as the Core Web Vitals. Cumulative Layout Shift is one of three metrics identified by Google as the Core Web Vitals. CLS scores up to 0.1 are considered \"Good\", between 0.1-0.25 considered \"Needs Improvement\", and above 0.25 considered \"Poor.\" timingName You can review different types of activities with the timingName attribute, such as firstPaint, firstContentfulPaint, firstInteraction, largestContentfulPaint, pageHide and windowUnload. For example, a PageViewTiming event may have a timingName of firstPaint and a firstPaint value of .03. The event will also include all default attributes included with the standard BrowserInteraction and PageView events. elementId This is the Id, if specified, of the largestContentfulPaint element. This value will only be reported with the LCP metric. This value can be null. elementSize This is the reported size of the largestContentfulPaint element. This value will only be reported with the LCP metric. pageHide The pageHide event, available with agent v1177, is sent when the browser hides the current page in the process of presenting a different page from the session's history. For example, when the user clicks the browser's Back button, the current page receives a pageHide event before the previous page is shown. Supporting documentation and browser compatibility for the pageHide event can be found in MDN docs. In addition, we now report the cumulative layout shift (CLS) score attribute with pageHide. This attribute is reported as cumulativeLayoutShift. windowLoad The windowLoad event, available with agent v1177, is fired when the whole page has loaded, including all dependent resources such as stylesheets and images. Supporting documentation and browser compatibility for the Window Load event can be found in MDN docs. In addition, we now report the cumulative layout shift (CLS) score attribute with windowLoad. This attribute is reported as cumulativeLayoutShift. windowUnload The windowUnload event, available with agent v1163, is fired when a document or child resource is being unloaded. Supporting documentation and browser compatibility for the Window Unload event can be found in MDN docs. In addition, we now report the cumulative layout shift (CLS) score attribute with windowUnload. This attribute is reported as cumulativeLayoutShift. Compatibility and requirements In addition to Browser's installation requirements, the PageViewTiming event requires Browser agent version 1153 or higher and a Browser Pro subscription. Follow our Browser agent release notes to find out when new metrics are released. These metrics are supported by the following browser versions. For unsupported browsers, no PageViewTiming events will be recorded. Metrics Supported browser versions cumulativeLayoutShift Chrome 79 Metric is elevated to stable; changes in metric definition will be reported in this log. Chrome 77 Metric exposed via API: Cumulative Layout Shift available via Layout Instability API firstPaint firstContentfulPaint Chrome 60 or higher for desktop and mobile (Android webview and Chrome for Android) Opera 47 or higher for desktop Opera 44 or higher for Android mobile Samsung Internet for mobile largestContentfulPaint Chrome 77 or higher for desktop and mobile firstInteraction firstInputDelay These metrics require the addEventListener Browser API. This API is available in all modern browsers, including: Apple Safari Google Chrome Microsoft Internet Explorer (IE) versions 9 or higher Mozilla Firefox pageHide This metric is currently supported by all browsers on desktop and mobile.

      "body": "This document describes data privacy related to Browser monitoring and cookies, and details about the cookies themselves. Page load timing (sometimes referred to as real user monitoring or RUM) creates the following cookies that Browser monitoring uses when session tracking in end-user browsers. Tip These cookies are related to Browser app monitoring. For more information about data privacy and requesting data to be deleted, see New Relic personal data requests. Data privacy and legal compliance The default Browser agent configuration does not retain any personal data as defined by common privacy laws such as the EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA). New Relic has taken steps to enable our customers who elect to process personal data in our products to do so in accordance with applicable privacy laws. Use the additional information below to help enable your compliance with such laws: Data Description IP addresses New Relic briefly collects and leverages the IP address from the end-user as part of the data collection process. The IP is captured when a connection is made between the end user's browser and the New Relic data collector. The IP address is included in the web request, much like a caller ID. New Relic uses the IP, much like you see a phone number when somebody calls you. The IP address is used as a lookup value that maps to additional details, allowing New Relic customers to diagnose performance issues. IP address lookup values include: countryCode regionCode city asn (Autonomous System Number) asnOrganization (ISP/Business/Institution) asnLatitude asnLongitude The mapping process for the IP address lookup value is typically complete within minutes, but in some extreme cases may take up to 24 hours to process. Once the mapping process is complete, New Relic no longer retains the IP address. Default cookies The Browser monitoring agent sets cookies by default. Cookies are placed by the Browser agent and the New Relic collector. The New Relic collector places a cookie when the Browser agent makes a connection and transmits data. A cookie consent manager that uses a conditional script loader that only loads tags/snippets when a visitor agrees to a specific type of cookies can be used. By choosing this option there is a risk that page performance will not be captured until the visitor has agreed and the Browser agent is running. With the release of Browser agent v1169, you can turn off cookie collection (JSESSIONID and NREUM) for your Browser app by using the Application settings page in the New Relic UI. Once this configuration value is set to false (OFF), you will no longer see the session information in your event data. By default, the value is set to true (ON) for all existing Browser apps as well as newly created ones. For more information, see our documentation about cookie collection and session tracking. Personal data through custom Browser configuration New Relic offers the option to manually configure your agent through the Browser monitoring API. This could be used to capture personal data, subject to the restrictions set forth in the Terms of Service with New Relic. (For example, no credit card numbers or sensitive categories of personal data, which are contractually prohibited.) New Relic responds to the instructions specified by the agents, including collecting personal data that may be custom configured. If you (as the data controller) receive a request from one of your own customers and determine that personal data sent to New Relic for processing must be deleted, see New Relic personal data requests. JSESSIONID The JSESSIONID cookie is used to store a session identifier so that New Relic can monitor session counts for an application. The cookie value is generated by Jetty. Components Description Session identifier This is used by New Relic to monitor session counts for an application. Domain The JSESSIONID cookie is associated with the New Relic domain. Expiration JSESSIONID is a session cookie that is deleted when the browser closes. NREUM This cookie is only created in browsers that do not support the Navigation Timing API. When a browser supports the Navigation Timing API, a native interface can be used to determine navigation start time. Mozilla Firefox versions 7 or higher support the Navigation Timing API. However, a bug exists in Firefox's early implementations of the Navigation Timing API that Browser monitoring works around by using this cookie. Components Description Navigation start time Navigation start time is required to measure end user response time. The cookie is written when the current page unloads (as the next navigation begins). Document location Stored as a hash. The document location is used with the referring page URL to validate that the start time refers to the page that was previously being viewed or refreshed (to avoid using an invalid start time from a different navigation). Referring page URLs Stored as a hash. The referring page URL is used with the document location to validate that the start time refers to the page that was previously being viewed or refreshed (to avoid using an invalid start time from a different navigation). Domain The NREUM cookie is associated with the root path of the domain in which the New Relic agent executes. Expiration NREUM is a session cookie that is deleted when the browser closes. NRAGENT The NRAGENT cookie is set only if you use Browser agent version v443 or lower. It is created when a token is handed out to an end user by the New Relic collector. End-user metrics are communicated to New Relic collectors via a JSONP request from the browser (script retrieval). The returned JavaScript contains a call to set the token identifier which is written to the cookie on the next navigation (when the page unloads). This achieves a cross-domain communication between the New Relic collector and the New Relic agent. This cookie is used to communicate between the New Relic collector aggregating end user metrics and the agent(s) running in the associated web application. A token identifies and correlates application tier transaction traces with corresponding browser traces. Components Description Token identifier The 16-character token identifier helps with cross-domain communication between the New Relic collector and the New Relic agent. Domain The NRAGENT cookie is associated with the root path of the domain in which the New Relic agent executes. Expiration NRAGENT is a session cookie that is deleted when the browser closes.",

Because we do not restrict the timing, you can receive first paint or first interaction data regardless of when it fires. This document describes why and how to use PageViewTiming and its attributes to query data about your site, component loading, and user performance metrics, both from visual and responsiveness standpoints. Why use PageViewTiming? If your application uses asynchronous or dynamic pages, you may need additional details about site or component loading. But pages can load content in many different ways, and users control when they interact with that content. This is why some user-centric performance metrics happen outside the standard window onload (page load time) in the Browser agent. For example, users may become impatient and begin clicking as soon as content is on the webpage. Or, they may wait to use the page until long after content is loaded. The PageViewTiming event provides a more real-time delivery mechanism that does not have a dependency on any other event. The additional metrics can help you understand how users experience your site, both from visual and responsiveness standpoints. Support for Google's Core Web Vitals We now, with the release of agent version 1177, have full support for Google's Core Web Vitals for 2020. The metrics that make up Core Web Vitals will evolve over time. The current set for 2020 focuses on three aspects of the user experience—loading, interactivity, and visual stability—and includes the following metrics (and their respective thresholds): Core Web Vitals metrics include loading, interactivity, and visual stability. Largest Contentful Paint (LCP): measures loading performance. To provide a good user experience, LCP should occur within 2.5 seconds of when the page first starts loading. First Input Delay (FID): measures interactivity. To provide a good user experience, pages should have a FID of less than 100 milliseconds. Cumulative Layout Shift (CLS): measures visual stability. To provide a good user experience, pages should maintain a CLS of less than 0.1. For each of the above metrics, to ensure you're hitting the recommended target for most of your users, a good threshold to measure is the 75th percentile of page loads, segmented across mobile and desktop devices. To learn more, watch our Nerd Days talk on perceived performance. Detailed visual, interactivity, and responsiveness metrics The BrowserInteraction and PageView events end their reporting when they receive the page window load (or window load and AJAX) timing. However, paint and interactivity metrics can happen at any time. PageViewTiming delivers these metrics as a separate event to: Account for the variability in this timing. Avoid setting an arbitrary timeout. Prevent holding BrowserInteraction and PageView events indefinitely. Additional data Comments firstPaint and firstContentfulPaint The firstPaint and firstContentfulPaint attributes already are available with BrowserInteraction and PageView events. However, they are not always reliably captured before the window onload event fires. Using PageViewTiming gives you a way to capture these metrics even if they happen after the original page load time. This gives you a better understanding of the correlation between responsiveness of that load event and the visual rendering of your content. largestContentfulPaint This new metric, available with agent version 1163, largestContentfulPaint, reports the render time of the largest content element visible in the viewport. Google's research found looking at when the largest element was rendered was a more accurate way to measure when the main content of a page is loaded and useful. Details on this metric, including limitations and considerations can be found in the w3c draft. In addition, we now report the cumulative layout shift (CLS) score attribute with LCP. This attribute is reported as cumulativeLayoutShift. Largest Contentful Paint is one of three metrics identified by Google as the Core Web Vitals. LCP values up to 2.5 secs are considered \"Good\", between 2.5-4.0 secs considered \"Needs Improvement\", and above 4.0 secs considered \"Poor.\" firstInteraction and firstInputDelay With the addition of firstInteraction and firstInputDelay, you can quickly determine the ways that your users are interacting with that visual content. These metrics tell you not only when they interacted, but what type of interaction (mousedown, pointerdown, etc.) and how long it took for them to receive a response from your site. The firstInputDelay metric lies in the middle of FirstContentfulPaint and Time to Interactive (TTI) metrics, measuring the time between when a first input can be made and when the browser's main thread is able to respond to any interactions. In addition, we now report the cumulative layout shift (CLS) score attribute at the moment of the user's first interaction. This attribute is reported as cumulativeLayoutShift. First Input Delay is one of three metrics identified by Google as the Core Web Vitals. FID values up to 100 ms are considered \"Good\", between 100-300 ms considered \"Needs Improvement\", and above 300 ms considered \"Poor.\" For a more detailed explanation, see the Browser release notes. cumulativeLayoutShift Cumulative Layout Shift (CLS), available with agent v1177, is an important, user-centric metric for measuring visual stability because it helps quantify how often users experience unexpected layout shifts—a low CLS helps ensure that the page is delightful. This is one of three metrics identified by Google as the Core Web Vitals. Cumulative Layout Shift is one of three metrics identified by Google as the Core Web Vitals. CLS scores up to 0.1 are considered \"Good\", between 0.1-0.25 considered \"Needs Improvement\", and above 0.25 considered \"Poor.\" timingName You can review different types of activities with the timingName attribute, such as firstPaint, firstContentfulPaint, firstInteraction, largestContentfulPaint, pageHide and windowUnload. For example, a PageViewTiming event may have a timingName of firstPaint and a firstPaint value of .03. The event will also include all default attributes included with the standard BrowserInteraction and PageView events. elementId This is the Id, if specified, of the largestContentfulPaint element. This value will only be reported with the LCP metric. This value can be null. elementSize This is the reported size of the largestContentfulPaint element. This value will only be reported with the LCP metric. pageHide The pageHide event, available with agent v1177, is sent when the browser hides the current page in the process of presenting a different page from the session's history. For example, when the user clicks the browser's Back button, the current page receives a pageHide event before the previous page is shown. Supporting documentation and browser compatibility for the pageHide event can be found in MDN docs. In addition, we now report the cumulative layout shift (CLS) score attribute with pageHide. This attribute is reported as cumulativeLayoutShift. windowLoad The windowLoad event, available with agent v1177, is fired when the whole page has loaded, including all dependent resources such as stylesheets and images. Supporting documentation and browser compatibility for the Window Load event can be found in MDN docs. In addition, we now report the cumulative layout shift (CLS) score attribute with windowLoad. This attribute is reported as cumulativeLayoutShift. windowUnload The windowUnload event, available with agent v1163, is fired when a document or child resource is being unloaded. Supporting documentation and browser compatibility for the Window Unload event can be found in MDN docs. In addition, we now report the cumulative layout shift (CLS) score attribute with windowUnload. This attribute is reported as cumulativeLayoutShift. Compatibility and requirements In addition to Browser's installation requirements, the PageViewTiming event requires Browser agent version 1153 or higher and a Browser Pro subscription. Follow our Browser agent release notes to find out when new metrics are released. These metrics are supported by the following browser versions. For unsupported browsers, no PageViewTiming events will be recorded.

      "body": "This document describes data privacy related to Browser monitoring and cookies, and details about the cookies themselves. Page load timing (sometimes referred to as real user monitoring or RUM) creates the following cookies that Browser monitoring uses when session tracking in end-user browsers. Tip These cookies are related to Browser app monitoring. For more information about data privacy and requesting data to be deleted, see New Relic personal data requests. Data privacy and legal compliance The default Browser agent configuration does not retain any personal data as defined by common privacy laws such as the EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA). New Relic has taken steps to enable our customers who elect to process personal data in our products to do so in accordance with applicable privacy laws. Use the additional information below to help enable your compliance with such laws: Data Description IP addresses New Relic briefly collects and leverages the IP address from the end-user as part of the data collection process. The IP is captured when a connection is made between the end user's browser and the New Relic data collector. The IP address is included in the web request, much like a caller ID. New Relic uses the IP, much like you see a phone number when somebody calls you. The IP address is used as a lookup value that maps to additional details, allowing New Relic customers to diagnose performance issues. IP address lookup values include: countryCode regionCode city asn (Autonomous System Number) asnOrganization (ISP/Business/Institution) asnLatitude asnLongitude The mapping process for the IP address lookup value is typically complete within minutes, but in some extreme cases may take up to 24 hours to process. Once the mapping process is complete, New Relic no longer retains the IP address. Default cookies The Browser monitoring agent sets cookies by default. Cookies are placed by the Browser agent and the New Relic collector. The New Relic collector places a cookie when the Browser agent makes a connection and transmits data. A cookie consent manager that uses a conditional script loader that only loads tags/snippets when a visitor agrees to a specific type of cookies can be used. By choosing this option there is a risk that page performance will not be captured until the visitor has agreed and the Browser agent is running. With the release of Browser agent v1169, you can turn off cookie collection (JSESSIONID and NREUM) for your Browser app by using the Application settings page in the New Relic UI. Once this configuration value is set to false (OFF), you will no longer see the session information in your event data. By default, the value is set to true (ON) for all existing Browser apps as well as newly created ones. For more information, see our documentation about cookie collection and session tracking. Personal data through custom Browser configuration New Relic offers the option to manually configure your agent through the Browser monitoring API. This could be used to capture personal data, subject to the restrictions set forth in the Terms of Service with New Relic. (For example, no credit card numbers or sensitive categories of personal data, which are contractually prohibited.) New Relic responds to the instructions specified by the agents, including collecting personal data that may be custom configured. If you (as the data controller) receive a request from one of your own customers and determine that personal data sent to New Relic for processing must be deleted, see New Relic personal data requests. JSESSIONID The JSESSIONID cookie is used to store a session identifier so that New Relic can monitor session counts for an application. The cookie value is generated by Jetty. Components Description Session identifier This is used by New Relic to monitor session counts for an application. Domain The JSESSIONID cookie is associated with the New Relic domain. Expiration JSESSIONID is a session cookie that is deleted when the browser closes. NREUM This cookie is only created in browsers that do not support the Navigation Timing API. When a browser supports the Navigation Timing API, a native interface can be used to determine navigation start time. Mozilla Firefox versions 7 or higher support the Navigation Timing API. However, a bug exists in Firefox's early implementations of the Navigation Timing API that Browser monitoring works around by using this cookie. Components Description Navigation start time Navigation start time is required to measure end user response time. The cookie is written when the current page unloads (as the next navigation begins). Document location Stored as a hash. The document location is used with the referring page URL to validate that the start time refers to the page that was previously being viewed or refreshed (to avoid using an invalid start time from a different navigation). Referring page URLs Stored as a hash. The referring page URL is used with the document location to validate that the start time refers to the page that was previously being viewed or refreshed (to avoid using an invalid start time from a different navigation). Domain The NREUM cookie is associated with the root path of the domain in which the New Relic agent executes. Expiration NREUM is a session cookie that is deleted when the browser closes. NRAGENT The NRAGENT cookie is set only if you use Browser agent version v443 or lower. It is created when a token is handed out to an end user by the New Relic collector. End-user metrics are communicated to New Relic collectors via a JSONP request from the browser (script retrieval). The returned JavaScript contains a call to set the token identifier which is written to the cookie on the next navigation (when the page unloads). This achieves a cross-domain communication between the New Relic collector and the New Relic agent. This cookie is used to communicate between the New Relic collector aggregating end user metrics and the agent(s) running in the associated web application. A token identifies and correlates application tier transaction traces with corresponding browser traces. Components Description Token identifier The 16-character token identifier helps with cross-domain communication between the New Relic collector and the New Relic agent. Domain The NRAGENT cookie is associated with the root path of the domain in which the New Relic agent executes. Expiration NRAGENT is a session cookie that is deleted when the browser closes.",

Page load timing (sometimes referred to as real user monitoring or RUM) creates the following cookies that Browser monitoring uses when session tracking in end-user browsers. Tip These cookies are related to Browser app monitoring. For more information about data privacy and requesting data to be deleted, see New Relic personal data requests. Data privacy and legal compliance The default Browser agent configuration does not retain any personal data as defined by common privacy laws such as the EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA). New Relic has taken steps to enable our customers who elect to process personal data in our products to do so in accordance with applicable privacy laws. Use the additional information below to help enable your compliance with such laws: Data Description IP addresses New Relic briefly collects and leverages the IP address from the end-user as part of the data collection process. The IP is captured when a connection is made between the end user's browser and the New Relic data collector. The IP address is included in the web request, much like a caller ID. New Relic uses the IP, much like you see a phone number when somebody calls you. The IP address is used as a lookup value that maps to additional details, allowing New Relic customers to diagnose performance issues. IP address lookup values include: countryCode regionCode city asn (Autonomous System Number) asnOrganization (ISP/Business/Institution) asnLatitude asnLongitude The mapping process for the IP address lookup value is typically complete within minutes, but in some extreme cases may take up to 24 hours to process. Once the mapping process is complete, New Relic no longer retains the IP address. Default cookies The Browser monitoring agent sets cookies by default. Cookies are placed by the Browser agent and the New Relic collector. The New Relic collector places a cookie when the Browser agent makes a connection and transmits data. A cookie consent manager that uses a conditional script loader that only loads tags/snippets when a visitor agrees to a specific type of cookies can be used. By choosing this option there is a risk that page performance will not be captured until the visitor has agreed and the Browser agent is running. With the release of Browser agent v1169, you can turn off cookie collection (JSESSIONID and NREUM) for your Browser app by using the Application settings page in the New Relic UI. Once this configuration value is set to false (OFF), you will no longer see the session information in your event data. By default, the value is set to true (ON) for all existing Browser apps as well as newly created ones. For more information, see our documentation about cookie collection and session tracking. Personal data through custom Browser configuration New Relic offers the option to manually configure your agent through the Browser monitoring API. This could be used to capture personal data, subject to the restrictions set forth in the Terms of Service with New Relic. (For example, no credit card numbers or sensitive categories of personal data, which are contractually prohibited.) New Relic responds to the instructions specified by the agents, including collecting personal data that may be custom configured. If you (as the data controller) receive a request from one of your own customers and determine that personal data sent to New Relic for processing must be deleted, see New Relic personal data requests. JSESSIONID The JSESSIONID cookie is used to store a session identifier so that New Relic can monitor session counts for an application. The cookie value is generated by Jetty. Components Description Session identifier This is used by New Relic to monitor session counts for an application. Domain The JSESSIONID cookie is associated with the New Relic domain.

      "body": "Pages can be cached in the browser or on a server. A cached page will contain stale (previously generated) application and queue times. Contents Detecting cached pages Browser monitoring detects cached pages by comparing the total back-end time against app and queue time. When the sum of app and queue time is greater than the total back-end time, Browser monitoring assumes the page was cached and aggregates the request with app and queue times as 0. Here are some additional tips for cached pages: Java: Flush the app server’s \"work\" cache. This forces the app server to recompile. .NET: Make sure your asp.net cache directory is clean by using the command flush_dotnet_temp.cmd. This forces the app server to recompile ASPs with page load timing instrumentation. Node.js: By default, Node.js does not cache pages. PHP: If you have a CDN cache your dynamic pages, make sure the cache contains the page load timing instrumentation. Python: Restart your app. Ruby: Look at the header information for automatic vs. manual instrumentation. For example, if you want to ignore specific webpages, you must disable automatic browser monitoring from the user interface, and then manually instrument the webpages that you do want to be tagged.

Have minimal impact on overall page load time and search engine optimization (SEO), including search engine ranking, indexing, crawl efficiency, or other SEO-related concerns. Contents Efficiency of inline JavaScript The most effective method for Browser monitoring is to include a minimal amount of JavaScript instrumentation code inline in the head of the monitored page. This code then retrieves the remainder of the necessary code after the page finishes loading. Other Browser monitoring methods include JavaScript code at the end of the page body or exclusively using an external script. However, these methods can limit visibility into the end users' experience. Impact on SEO Performance testing results indicate that using Browser monitoring's JavaScript has a negligible effect on page load time. In addition, it has no negative impact on how users or search engines interact with your site. Google's consistent recommendation to website owners is to build a site that is valuable to users and accessible to search engine crawlers. Google rankings favor sites that provide the most relevant information and the best user experience. Browser monitoring can help you improve user experience by identifying performance bottlenecks, including: Slow page loads Problematic JavaScript errors Long AJAX calls Identifying Javascript errors is especially helpful because Google's bots are increasingly running the JavaScript code on websites they crawl in order to access content provided by AJAX-heavy web applications. A JavaScript error that previously was only visible to human users (for example, a broken button) could affect whether the Google bots can successfully interact with your site. We understand that SEO and traffic referred by search engines are critically important to many businesses. When used effectively, Browser monitoring can even increase a site's ranking in Google and other search engines by improving performance and user experience.

      "body": "Browser monitoring provides insights into how your application or site behaves when it is loaded in a web browser. Browser only records performance data, as explained in this document. It does not record any data used or stored by the monitored application unless you explicitly configure it to do so. For more information about New Relic's security measures, see our security and privacy documentation, or visit the New Relic security website. Reported data Browser reports many different types of data to help you analyze your website's performance. It only reports page view data, unless you have subscribed to Pro features. You can also enable functionality for AJAX requests, JavaScript errors, and session traces. For most data types, Browser transmits the data securely using HTTPS encryption. The Browser agent transmits data to New Relic's collectors by using either of the domains bam.nr-data.net or bam-cell.nr-data.net. Here is a summary of the types of data reported by Browser monitoring. Page view data This data is reported once per page view and consists of: Page load timing data Name of the server-side app controller that served the page, if available (obfuscated in the page and during transmission) Additional custom parameters set by the server-side app controller, if available (obfuscated in the page and during transmission) Additional custom parameters set by the Browser agent API, if set prior to page load This information appears on the Page views page. For data security reasons, Browser does not record or collect URL query strings. Server-side data can only be collected when the host is also instrumented by New Relic and the browser monitoring instrumentation is injected by the agent. For more information about how we collect and present this data, see Instrumentation for page load timing. AJAX timing data When enabled, Browser periodically reports AJAX timing data until the user navigates away from or closes the page. (New Relic automatically filters out all AJAX requests that take longer than two minutes.) Data includes: Hostnames, ports, and paths (but not search/query parameters) of AJAX request URLs HTTP status code of responses Byte size of request message bodies Name of the server-side app controller servicing the AJAX request and server-side timing data (obfuscated in the page and during transmission), when the browser instrumentation is injected by the New Relic agent Timing data for the AJAX transaction Timing data for the AJAX callbacks This information appears on the AJAX page. JavaScript error data When enabled, Browser periodically reports data about every error that occurs on the page until the user navigates away from or closes the page. This information appears on the JavaScript errors page. For each error, the data includes: Exception class of the error Error message containing arbitrary text Stack trace of the error, which may contain function names and URLs of scripts causing the error Error messages typically do not contain any confidential or sensitive information. However, it is possible for messages to be purposefully constructed with sensitive information. Before enabling JavaScript error reporting, ensure that your website does not expose any sensitive information in error messages. Session trace data When enabled, Browser periodically reports data on the details of the a single page's life cycle, including user interactions, AJAX loads, and JavaScript errors, until the user navigates away from or closes the page. New Relic automatically stops recording further data after ten minutes. Data includes: Asset load timing details User interactions such as scrolling, mousing, and clicking JavaScript error timing and other JavaScript error information Triggered Javascript events Session traces are captured randomly at a fixed rate from among the monitored page views. Session trace information appears on the Session traces page. SPA data If you use Browser's single-page app (SPA) monitoring, New Relic reports the following data once per page load or route change. Browser data for page views, AJAX timing, JavaScript errors, and session traces Hash fragments associated with SPA route changes Additional custom parameters added from the SPA API When SPA monitoring has been enabled, this information appears on the Page views page. Server-side data can only be collected when the host is also instrumented by New Relic, and the Browser monitoring instrumentation is injected by the agent. For more information about how we collect and present this data, see Instrumentation for page load timing. URL query strings The Browser agent uses the HTTP referer attribute to track page URLs. URLs can sometimes contain potentially sensitive user-entered query data (for example, a user's name). For data security reasons, Browser does not record or collect URL query strings. Visitor's IP address Browser uses the visitor's IP address to enrich data for additional visitor segmentation. Details such as the ASN and geoID are mapped to Browser data from the IP address. For data security reasons, Browser does not retain the visitor's IP address for reporting. The IP address is obtained in the HTTP header from the request to the New Relic collector. New Relic does not retain the visitor's IP address after the attributes have been mapped. The IP address value is overwritten within 24 hours of data being collected. Browser types Browser determines the browser type from the User-Agent header and the geographical location based on the browser's IP address. New Relic does not retain the IP address, only the country and region associated with the performance data. This information appears on the selected app's Geography page. Also, details about specific browser types appear on the selected app's Browsers page. CDN access Page load timing requires access to the content delivery network (CDN), where New Relic's utility JavaScript file (nr.js) is hosted. The domain name for the file (js-agent.newrelic.com) remains static, but the number in the path (version) may change periodically. A script tag is injected by the New Relic agent (or pasted into the webpage for standalone apps) that references the JavaScript on the CDN, which is then loaded by the browser. The loaded JavaScript collects and reports the metrics dynamically to either of the domains bam.nr-data.net or bam-cell.nr-data.net. Important If your end users are behind a firewall or proxy and do not have access to the CDN or to New Relic's networks (including bam.nr-data.net and bam-cell.nr-data.net), Browser monitoring will not work. Cookies Browser monitoring creates cookies in the end user's browser. If the user has cookies disabled, page load timing (sometimes referred to as real user monitoring or RUM) will not be able to track sessions properly. Also, if the user has an older browser that does not support the Navigation Timing Specification API, page load timing will not be able to track response times as accurately. New Relic's cookies generated by Browser agents older than version 995 may not contain the secure attribute. This is because page load timing data transmission in versions before version 995 use HTTP when the page is HTTP, but use HTTPS when the page is HTTPS. All Browser agent versions above version 995 will always use the secure flag for cookies and transmit over HTTPS. JavaScript and AJAX data may contain more sensitive information, so they are always transmitted over HTTPS. Transmission of these cookies using HTTP or access to them from JavaScript is not a significant security risk, because the cookies are not used to make security decisions or allow access to an account. They are used only to collect performance data, with any identifiable data obfuscated. For customers subject to special guidelines for cookie collection, such as those under the EU GDPR/PECR ICO Guidelines, we now provide the option to disable cookie collection for your application. Please see our Browser agent v1169 release notes for more information. Important If your site uses P3P, it must be configured to allow these cookies. JSONP requests Page load timing metrics are reported to New Relic using a Script GET, also known as a JSONP request. The Script GET returns a value that is subsequently stored in a cookie and used to trigger trace capturing.",

This document contains: Benefits of this feature Requirements Enable distributed tracing Enable cross-origin resource sharing (CORS) Find and query data Troubleshooting Tip Browser data is available in standard distributed tracing only, not Infinite Tracing. Benefits of browser data in distributed tracing By enabling New Relic to report browser data to distributed tracing, you can see the connection between front-end activity and back-end activity. You can see across a full transaction, from time spent by an end user in the web browser, to network activity, to associated back-end services. Benefits of this feature: Quickly spot latencies, errors, and anomalies in the browser or network Resolve customer-facing problems more quickly All the benefits of distributed tracing applied to your end-user monitoring Requirements and compatibility This feature reports AJAX requests (Fetch and XHR) that occur during a browser interaction. By default, only single-origin requests are monitored unless cross-origin resource sharing is enabled. Make sure you have the minimum versions for your Browser, APM, and APM agents: Browser Pro + SPA, with distributed tracing enabled Browser agent version 1153 or higher Browser agent version 1158 or higher (required for cross-origin resource sharing) Browser agent version 1173 or higher (required for w3c trace context support) APM agent version: C SDK 1.3 or higher Java 5.9.0 or higher PHP 9.4.0 or higher Other APM agent version requirements Enable distributed tracing To enable distributed tracing for Browser monitoring: Make sure you meet requirements, including having: Full-Stack Observability Browser Pro with SPA enabled Go to one.newrelic.com, and click Browser > (select an app) > Settings > Application settings. Turn on the Distributed tracing toggle. By default, for agent version 1173 and above, the newrelic, traceparent, and tracestate headers will be added to all same-origin AJAX requests. Optional: If all of your services are configured to use the w3c trace context headers, you can choose to exclude the newrelic, traceparent, and tracestate headers from requests. Optional: Enable cross-origin resource sharing. Redeploy the Browser agent (either restarting the associated APM agent or updating the copy/paste Browser installation). Enable cross-origin resource sharing (CORS) If you have AJAX requests that need resources from different origins, you can enable cross-origin resource sharing (CORS). By default, distributed tracing for cross-origin requests is not enabled because of browser CORS security restrictions: Distributed tracing is implemented by adding a custom HTTP headers (newrelic, traceparent, and tracestate) to outgoing AJAX requests, and browsers typically do not allow custom headers on cross-origin requests. With the release of agent version 1173, we now support the w3c trace context headers (traceparent and tracestate) so these should also be allowed in your configuration. There are two separate configurations required to enable cross-origin distributed tracing: Configure the service on the different origin to accept the newrelic custom header Configure Browser monitoring to include the target origin in distributed tracing Our step-by-step instructions provide key concepts and steps to enable this feature, but if you need more background about how cross-origin resource sharing works, we recommend this Mozilla developer document. Risks and mitigations Caution Cross-origin resource sharing can expose you to a high level of risk if the services on the different origins are not configured correctly. The AJAX requests will likely return an error, resulting in a variety of failures, including: Resources failing to load (for example, images and key content) Login failures Entire site outages (depending on type of requests enabled) By enabling this cross-origin resource sharing feature, you are acknowledging the following: You understand that this feature is optional and not mandatory. You understand the steps you need to take in order to enable this feature for your services and your domains. You understand that if you do not properly configure your services prior to deployment (including but not limited to configuring your services on your domains to accept custom headers) portions or all of your website will likely malfunction. You understand that New Relic is neither responsible nor liable for errors or issues related to your misconfiguration of servers or services. You fully and solely accept the risks and wish to proceed. The best way to minimize your risk is to ensure you fully understand the process and to try it first in a test environment. Before reading the step-by-step instructions, it may help to first read this overview of the process: To use distributed tracing with cross-origin resources, you populate a list of approved cross-origin resources in New Relic, and then we automatically send the following custom headers to those resources: newrelic, traceparent, and tracestate. For this process to work, you must first ensure that someone has configured the services on the other origins to accept this custom header. Cross-origin resource sharing uses a variety of HTTP headers (both in the request and response). The header that specifically applies to New Relic is the Access-Control-Allow-Headers response header, which can include newrelic, traceparent, tracestate, or newrelic, traceparent, tracestate in its value depending on what tracing strategies you enabled in your APM-monitored application. You must configure your server to return this CORS header in its response. Example: Access-Control-Allow-Headers: newrelic, traceparent, tracestate Important New Relic cannot perform any validation to ensure the services on the other origins were configured correctly. If you're unsure about how to allow these headers, do not add cross-origin resources to the approved list in the New Relic UI. Enable cross-origin resource sharing Caution You should always try enabling CORS in a test environment before setting it up in production. To enable cross-origin resource sharing: Confirm that the services on the other origins are configured to accept the newrelic header using: Access-Control-Allow-Headers: newrelic, traceparent, tracestate (for details, see Risks and mitigations). Confirm that you meet the Browser monitoring requirements. Make sure you are in one.newrelic.com, and click Browser > (select an app) > Application settings. Turn on the Distributed tracing toggle if it's not already enabled. Turn on the Cross-origin resource sharing (CORS) toggle. Under Cross-origin resource sharing (CORS), add cross-origin resources to the approved list. Important Valid cross-origin resources must include: The prefix http:// or https:// The domain name The port number is not required unless it differs from the default for HTTP (port 80) or HTTPS (port 443). Select Save application settings to update the agent configuration. Redeploy the Browser agent (either restarting the associated APM agent or updating the copy/paste Browser installation). Find data Tips for finding and querying data: You can find end-user-originating traces in any New Relic One distributed tracing UI. In the distributed tracing UI, end-user spans are indicated with the icon. To see a span's attributes, select a span in the UI. Spans are reported as Span data, and can be queried in New Relic. Query tips: Query by browser app name by setting browserApp.name to the browser app name. Query for traces containing at least one browser app span with browserApp.name is not null. Query for traces containing at least one back-end app with appName is not null. Query for traces containing both browser and back-end spans by combining the two previous conditions. Troubleshooting If you don't see end-user spans, or are having other distributed tracing issues, see Troubleshooting.",

The JavaScript is included in a packet of webpage data that is sent anyway. In addition, it immediately begins monitoring for errors and events as the rest of the webpage executes. The negligible amount of overhead required to load the JavaScript results in a significant return of actionable data. Contents Overall impact The JavaScript's overhead takes into consideration both the impact on the user and the impact on your systems' performance: User perception: Typically users cannot detect performance degradations on a website of less than 200ms. Browser's JavaScript adds less than 15ms in aggregated time per page load. This is split up over time, so at no point would a user be able to perceive any performance impact due to the JavaScript. Webserver and systems: Browser App Monitoring occurs on the user's browser, not on the server. Processing time does not have an impact on your CPU consumption. In addition, we take additional steps to minimize any potential impact on the apps and webpages being monitored. For example, the \"loader\" script is loaded synchronously in the <HEAD> in order to ensure monitoring is enabled for the entire life cycle of the page. This script is included inline, which eliminates the need for another roundtrip network request to a content delivery network (CDN). The \"loader\" comes with the initial page load. Later in the life cycle of the page, New Relic loads an additional monitoring script asynchronously. This script should not have any perceivable effect to the user and is included in the overall overhead of less than 15ms per page. Network impact Browser monitoring also minimizes network traffic for the end user by aggregating data locally (in the client) and sending it back to New Relic on load, at periodic intervals, on unload, or when data has been collected. (During the browser session's idle periods, transmissions may not be required.)

Page view data This data is reported once per page view and consists of: Page load timing data Name of the server-side app controller that served the page, if available (obfuscated in the page and during transmission) Additional custom parameters set by the server-side app controller, if available (obfuscated in the page and during transmission) Additional custom parameters set by the Browser agent API, if set prior to page load This information appears on the Page views page. For data security reasons, Browser does not record or collect URL query strings. Server-side data can only be collected when the host is also instrumented by New Relic and the browser monitoring instrumentation is injected by the agent. For more information about how we collect and present this data, see Instrumentation for page load timing. AJAX timing data When enabled, Browser periodically reports AJAX timing data until the user navigates away from or closes the page. (New Relic automatically filters out all AJAX requests that take longer than two minutes.) Data includes: Hostnames, ports, and paths (but not search/query parameters) of AJAX request URLs HTTP status code of responses Byte size of request message bodies Name of the server-side app controller servicing the AJAX request and server-side timing data (obfuscated in the page and during transmission), when the browser instrumentation is injected by the New Relic agent Timing data for the AJAX transaction Timing data for the AJAX callbacks This information appears on the AJAX page. JavaScript error data When enabled, Browser periodically reports data about every error that occurs on the page until the user navigates away from or closes the page. This information appears on the JavaScript errors page. For each error, the data includes: Exception class of the error Error message containing arbitrary text Stack trace of the error, which may contain function names and URLs of scripts causing the error Error messages typically do not contain any confidential or sensitive information. However, it is possible for messages to be purposefully constructed with sensitive information. Before enabling JavaScript error reporting, ensure that your website does not expose any sensitive information in error messages. Session trace data When enabled, Browser periodically reports data on the details of the a single page's life cycle, including user interactions, AJAX loads, and JavaScript errors, until the user navigates away from or closes the page. New Relic automatically stops recording further data after ten minutes. Data includes: Asset load timing details User interactions such as scrolling, mousing, and clicking JavaScript error timing and other JavaScript error information Triggered Javascript events Session traces are captured randomly at a fixed rate from among the monitored page views. Session trace information appears on the Session traces page. SPA data If you use Browser's single-page app (SPA) monitoring, New Relic reports the following data once per page load or route change. Browser data for page views, AJAX timing, JavaScript errors, and session traces Hash fragments associated with SPA route changes Additional custom parameters added from the SPA API When SPA monitoring has been enabled, this information appears on the Page views page. Server-side data can only be collected when the host is also instrumented by New Relic, and the Browser monitoring instrumentation is injected by the agent. For more information about how we collect and present this data, see Instrumentation for page load timing. URL query strings The Browser agent uses the HTTP referer attribute to track page URLs. URLs can sometimes contain potentially sensitive user-entered query data (for example, a user's name). For data security reasons, Browser does not record or collect URL query strings. Visitor's IP address Browser uses the visitor's IP address to enrich data for additional visitor segmentation. Details such as the ASN and geoID are mapped to Browser data from the IP address. For data security reasons, Browser does not retain the visitor's IP address for reporting. The IP address is obtained in the HTTP header from the request to the New Relic collector. New Relic does not retain the visitor's IP address after the attributes have been mapped. The IP address value is overwritten within 24 hours of data being collected. Browser types Browser determines the browser type from the User-Agent header and the geographical location based on the browser's IP address. New Relic does not retain the IP address, only the country and region associated with the performance data. This information appears on the selected app's Geography page. Also, details about specific browser types appear on the selected app's Browsers page. CDN access Page load timing requires access to the content delivery network (CDN), where New Relic's utility JavaScript file (nr.js) is hosted. The domain name for the file (js-agent.newrelic.com) remains static, but the number in the path (version) may change periodically. A script tag is injected by the New Relic agent (or pasted into the webpage for standalone apps) that references the JavaScript on the CDN, which is then loaded by the browser. The loaded JavaScript collects and reports the metrics dynamically to either of the domains bam.nr-data.net or bam-cell.nr-data.net. Important If your end users are behind a firewall or proxy and do not have access to the CDN or to New Relic's networks (including bam.nr-data.net and bam-cell.nr-data.net), Browser monitoring will not work. Cookies Browser monitoring creates cookies in the end user's browser. If the user has cookies disabled, page load timing (sometimes referred to as real user monitoring or RUM) will not be able to track sessions properly. Also, if the user has an older browser that does not support the Navigation Timing Specification API, page load timing will not be able to track response times as accurately. New Relic's cookies generated by Browser agents older than version 995 may not contain the secure attribute. This is because page load timing data transmission in versions before version 995 use HTTP when the page is HTTP, but use HTTPS when the page is HTTPS. All Browser agent versions above version 995 will always use the secure flag for cookies and transmit over HTTPS. JavaScript and AJAX data may contain more sensitive information, so they are always transmitted over HTTPS. Transmission of these cookies using HTTP or access to them from JavaScript is not a significant security risk, because the cookies are not used to make security decisions or allow access to an account. They are used only to collect performance data, with any identifiable data obfuscated. For customers subject to special guidelines for cookie collection, such as those under the EU GDPR/PECR ICO Guidelines, we now provide the option to disable cookie collection for your application. Please see our Browser agent v1169 release notes for more information. Important If your site uses P3P, it must be configured to allow these cookies. JSONP requests Page load timing metrics are reported to New Relic using a Script GET, also known as a JSONP request. The Script GET returns a value that is subsequently stored in a cookie and used to trigger trace capturing.",

This document contains: Benefits of this feature Requirements Enable distributed tracing Enable cross-origin resource sharing (CORS) Find and query data Troubleshooting Tip Browser data is available in standard distributed tracing only, not Infinite Tracing. Benefits of browser data in distributed tracing By enabling New Relic to report browser data to distributed tracing, you can see the connection between front-end activity and back-end activity. You can see across a full transaction, from time spent by an end user in the web browser, to network activity, to associated back-end services. Benefits of this feature: Quickly spot latencies, errors, and anomalies in the browser or network Resolve customer-facing problems more quickly All the benefits of distributed tracing applied to your end-user monitoring Requirements and compatibility This feature reports AJAX requests (Fetch and XHR) that occur during a browser interaction. By default, only single-origin requests are monitored unless cross-origin resource sharing is enabled. Make sure you have the minimum versions for your Browser, APM, and APM agents: Browser Pro + SPA, with distributed tracing enabled Browser agent version 1153 or higher Browser agent version 1158 or higher (required for cross-origin resource sharing) Browser agent version 1173 or higher (required for w3c trace context support) APM agent version: C SDK 1.3 or higher Java 5.9.0 or higher PHP 9.4.0 or higher Other APM agent version requirements Enable distributed tracing To enable distributed tracing for Browser monitoring: Make sure you meet requirements, including having: Full-Stack Observability Browser Pro with SPA enabled Go to one.newrelic.com, and click Browser > (select an app) > Settings > Application settings. Turn on the Distributed tracing toggle. By default, for agent version 1173 and above, the newrelic, traceparent, and tracestate headers will be added to all same-origin AJAX requests. Optional: If all of your services are configured to use the w3c trace context headers, you can choose to exclude the newrelic, traceparent, and tracestate headers from requests. Optional: Enable cross-origin resource sharing. Redeploy the Browser agent (either restarting the associated APM agent or updating the copy/paste Browser installation). Enable cross-origin resource sharing (CORS) If you have AJAX requests that need resources from different origins, you can enable cross-origin resource sharing (CORS). By default, distributed tracing for cross-origin requests is not enabled because of browser CORS security restrictions: Distributed tracing is implemented by adding a custom HTTP headers (newrelic, traceparent, and tracestate) to outgoing AJAX requests, and browsers typically do not allow custom headers on cross-origin requests. With the release of agent version 1173, we now support the w3c trace context headers (traceparent and tracestate) so these should also be allowed in your configuration. There are two separate configurations required to enable cross-origin distributed tracing: Configure the service on the different origin to accept the newrelic custom header Configure Browser monitoring to include the target origin in distributed tracing Our step-by-step instructions provide key concepts and steps to enable this feature, but if you need more background about how cross-origin resource sharing works, we recommend this Mozilla developer document. Risks and mitigations Caution Cross-origin resource sharing can expose you to a high level of risk if the services on the different origins are not configured correctly. The AJAX requests will likely return an error, resulting in a variety of failures, including: Resources failing to load (for example, images and key content) Login failures Entire site outages (depending on type of requests enabled) By enabling this cross-origin resource sharing feature, you are acknowledging the following: You understand that this feature is optional and not mandatory. You understand the steps you need to take in order to enable this feature for your services and your domains. You understand that if you do not properly configure your services prior to deployment (including but not limited to configuring your services on your domains to accept custom headers) portions or all of your website will likely malfunction. You understand that New Relic is neither responsible nor liable for errors or issues related to your misconfiguration of servers or services. You fully and solely accept the risks and wish to proceed. The best way to minimize your risk is to ensure you fully understand the process and to try it first in a test environment. Before reading the step-by-step instructions, it may help to first read this overview of the process: To use distributed tracing with cross-origin resources, you populate a list of approved cross-origin resources in New Relic, and then we automatically send the following custom headers to those resources: newrelic, traceparent, and tracestate. For this process to work, you must first ensure that someone has configured the services on the other origins to accept this custom header. Cross-origin resource sharing uses a variety of HTTP headers (both in the request and response). The header that specifically applies to New Relic is the Access-Control-Allow-Headers response header, which can include newrelic, traceparent, tracestate, or newrelic, traceparent, tracestate in its value depending on what tracing strategies you enabled in your APM-monitored application. You must configure your server to return this CORS header in its response. Example: Access-Control-Allow-Headers: newrelic, traceparent, tracestate Important New Relic cannot perform any validation to ensure the services on the other origins were configured correctly. If you're unsure about how to allow these headers, do not add cross-origin resources to the approved list in the New Relic UI. Enable cross-origin resource sharing Caution You should always try enabling CORS in a test environment before setting it up in production. To enable cross-origin resource sharing: Confirm that the services on the other origins are configured to accept the newrelic header using: Access-Control-Allow-Headers: newrelic, traceparent, tracestate (for details, see Risks and mitigations). Confirm that you meet the Browser monitoring requirements. Make sure you are in one.newrelic.com, and click Browser > (select an app) > Application settings. Turn on the Distributed tracing toggle if it's not already enabled. Turn on the Cross-origin resource sharing (CORS) toggle. Under Cross-origin resource sharing (CORS), add cross-origin resources to the approved list. Important Valid cross-origin resources must include: The prefix http:// or https:// The domain name The port number is not required unless it differs from the default for HTTP (port 80) or HTTPS (port 443). Select Save application settings to update the agent configuration. Redeploy the Browser agent (either restarting the associated APM agent or updating the copy/paste Browser installation). Find data Tips for finding and querying data: You can find end-user-originating traces in any New Relic One distributed tracing UI. In the distributed tracing UI, end-user spans are indicated with the icon. To see a span's attributes, select a span in the UI. Spans are reported as Span data, and can be queried in New Relic. Query tips: Query by browser app name by setting browserApp.name to the browser app name. Query for traces containing at least one browser app span with browserApp.name is not null. Query for traces containing at least one back-end app with appName is not null. Query for traces containing both browser and back-end spans by combining the two previous conditions. Troubleshooting If you don't see end-user spans, or are having other distributed tracing issues, see Troubleshooting.",

The JavaScript is included in a packet of webpage data that is sent anyway. In addition, it immediately begins monitoring for errors and events as the rest of the webpage executes. The negligible amount of overhead required to load the JavaScript results in a significant return of actionable data. Contents Overall impact The JavaScript's overhead takes into consideration both the impact on the user and the impact on your systems' performance: User perception: Typically users cannot detect performance degradations on a website of less than 200ms. Browser's JavaScript adds less than 15ms in aggregated time per page load. This is split up over time, so at no point would a user be able to perceive any performance impact due to the JavaScript. Webserver and systems: Browser App Monitoring occurs on the user's browser, not on the server. Processing time does not have an impact on your CPU consumption. In addition, we take additional steps to minimize any potential impact on the apps and webpages being monitored. For example, the \"loader\" script is loaded synchronously in the <HEAD> in order to ensure monitoring is enabled for the entire life cycle of the page. This script is included inline, which eliminates the need for another roundtrip network request to a content delivery network (CDN). The \"loader\" comes with the initial page load. Later in the life cycle of the page, New Relic loads an additional monitoring script asynchronously. This script should not have any perceivable effect to the user and is included in the overall overhead of less than 15ms per page. Network impact Browser monitoring also minimizes network traffic for the end user by aggregating data locally (in the client) and sending it back to New Relic on load, at periodic intervals, on unload, or when data has been collected. (During the browser session's idle periods, transmissions may not be required.)

Have minimal impact on overall page load time and search engine optimization (SEO), including search engine ranking, indexing, crawl efficiency, or other SEO-related concerns. Contents Efficiency of inline JavaScript The most effective method for Browser monitoring is to include a minimal amount of JavaScript instrumentation code inline in the head of the monitored page. This code then retrieves the remainder of the necessary code after the page finishes loading. Other Browser monitoring methods include JavaScript code at the end of the page body or exclusively using an external script. However, these methods can limit visibility into the end users' experience. Impact on SEO Performance testing results indicate that using Browser monitoring's JavaScript has a negligible effect on page load time. In addition, it has no negative impact on how users or search engines interact with your site. Google's consistent recommendation to website owners is to build a site that is valuable to users and accessible to search engine crawlers. Google rankings favor sites that provide the most relevant information and the best user experience. Browser monitoring can help you improve user experience by identifying performance bottlenecks, including: Slow page loads Problematic JavaScript errors Long AJAX calls Identifying Javascript errors is especially helpful because Google's bots are increasingly running the JavaScript code on websites they crawl in order to access content provided by AJAX-heavy web applications. A JavaScript error that previously was only visible to human users (for example, a broken button) could affect whether the Google bots can successfully interact with your site.

The AJAX requests will likely return an error, resulting in a variety of failures, including: Resources failing to load (for example, images and key content) Login failures Entire site outages (depending on type of requests enabled) By enabling this cross-origin resource sharing feature, you are acknowledging the following: You understand that this feature is optional and not mandatory. You understand the steps you need to take in order to enable this feature for your services and your domains. You understand that if you do not properly configure your services prior to deployment (including but not limited to configuring your services on your domains to accept custom headers) portions or all of your website will likely malfunction. You understand that New Relic is neither responsible nor liable for errors or issues related to your misconfiguration of servers or services. You fully and solely accept the risks and wish to proceed. The best way to minimize your risk is to ensure you fully understand the process and to try it first in a test environment. Before reading the step-by-step instructions, it may help to first read this overview of the process: To use distributed tracing with cross-origin resources, you populate a list of approved cross-origin resources in New Relic, and then we automatically send the following custom headers to those resources: newrelic, traceparent, and tracestate. For this process to work, you must first ensure that someone has configured the services on the other origins to accept this custom header. Cross-origin resource sharing uses a variety of HTTP headers (both in the request and response). The header that specifically applies to New Relic is the Access-Control-Allow-Headers response header, which can include newrelic, traceparent, tracestate, or newrelic, traceparent, tracestate in its value depending on what tracing strategies you enabled in your APM-monitored application. You must configure your server to return this CORS header in its response. Example: Access-Control-Allow-Headers: newrelic, traceparent, tracestate Important New Relic cannot perform any validation to ensure the services on the other origins were configured correctly. If you're unsure about how to allow these headers, do not add cross-origin resources to the approved list in the New Relic UI. Enable cross-origin resource sharing Caution You should always try enabling CORS in a test environment before setting it up in production. To enable cross-origin resource sharing: Confirm that the services on the other origins are configured to accept the newrelic header using: Access-Control-Allow-Headers: newrelic, traceparent, tracestate (for details, see Risks and mitigations). Confirm that you meet the Browser monitoring requirements. Make sure you are in one.newrelic.com, and click Browser > (select an app) > Application settings. Turn on the Distributed tracing toggle if it's not already enabled. Turn on the Cross-origin resource sharing (CORS) toggle. Under Cross-origin resource sharing (CORS), add cross-origin resources to the approved list. Important Valid cross-origin resources must include: The prefix http:// or https:// The domain name The port number is not required unless it differs from the default for HTTP (port 80) or HTTPS (port 443). Select Save application settings to update the agent configuration. Redeploy the Browser agent (either restarting the associated APM agent or updating the copy/paste Browser installation). Find data Tips for finding and querying data: You can find end-user-originating traces in any New Relic One distributed tracing UI. In the distributed tracing UI, end-user spans are indicated with the icon. To see a span's attributes, select a span in the UI. Spans are reported as Span data, and can be queried in New Relic. Query tips: Query by browser app name by setting browserApp.name to the browser app name. Query for traces containing at least one browser app span with browserApp.name is not null. Query for traces containing at least one back-end app with appName is not null. Query for traces containing both browser and back-end spans by combining the two previous conditions. Troubleshooting If you don't see end-user spans, or are having other distributed tracing issues, see Troubleshooting.",

Enable cross-origin resource sharing (CORS) If you have AJAX requests that need resources from different origins, you can enable cross-origin resource sharing (CORS). By default, distributed tracing for cross-origin requests is not enabled because of browser CORS security restrictions: Distributed tracing is implemented by adding a custom HTTP headers (newrelic, traceparent, and tracestate) to outgoing AJAX requests, and browsers typically do not allow custom headers on cross-origin requests.

      "body": "Problem You're looking for performance breakdowns for specific pages or endpoints on the browser monitoring Page views UI page or AJAX UI page. The UI doesn't show the URL group you're looking for, or it only shows / and /*. This behavior also appears in SPA data in BrowserInteraction events and applies to browserInteractionName, targetGroupedUrl, and previousGroupedUrl attributes. Solution Browser monitoring automatically \"learns\" to group your page views when your application is first deployed, and it adds that information to an allow list for URLs. Sometimes this grouping may not match your current page view information. To solve this problem, manage your application's URL segment list settings by editing existing rules or by adding the domains and URL segments that make up your site's URLs. After you add the necessary rules, you should see a useful breakdown of your information in the UI. Here are some useful tips: Adding segments to your allow list Tip Use constant URL segments. Only add the URL segments that remain constant across many page views. Do not add unique segments such as IDs or highly-specific categories, because this can lead to metric grouping issues. Enter exact matches. Enter any URL segments as exact matches, including case. Use existing rules. If a rule already appears for a domain: Go to one.newrelic.com > Browser > (select an app) > Settings > Segment allow lists. Rather than creating a new rule, edit the existing rule, and add the domain to the UI's Allow listed segments field. Group sub-domains. Group similar sub-domains such as foo.domain.com and bar.domain.com under *.domain.com. This grouping must occur just before the top-level domain name. Set up single-page apps. If your site is a single-page application and you only see / under page views, then your grouping is working correctly. New Relic records subsequent requests as AJAX loads, and your AJAX page will contain more detailed information. If it doesn't, then follow the tips in this document. Remove rules when appropriate. If you need to remove a rule, get support at support.newrelic.com.",

      "body": "Browser uses a JavaScript snippet (or \"agent\") to instrument your app's webpages. The JavaScript collects data for browser monitoring. To install the browser agent, you can choose from a number of deployment options. Tip To use Browser and the rest of our observability platform, join the New Relic family! Sign up to create your free account in only a few seconds. Then ingest up to 100GB of data for free each month. Forever. Select a deployment option No matter which option you use to deploy browser monitoring, the end result is to inject the browser agent's JavaScript snippet into your pages for browser monitoring. The method you select depends on your preferences and business needs. To view the procedure to install and enable the browser agent, click the link for the option you want to use. You can also use the Browser Application settings page to update settings. Important The following configuration options refer only to the browser monitoring agent. These are not the same as the New Relic user roles and editions. Browser deployment option Description Use the APM agent to inject the JavaScript You can use an APM agent to automatically inject the browser monitoring JavaScript snippet for you. This is the easiest way to install the agent for an app that already is being monitored by APM. (APM-monitored apps are listed on your APM Applications index.) Paste the JavaScript snippet into a webpage This allows you to control the exact placement of the JavaScript into your app's webpage(s) by copying and pasting the browser agent's JavaScript snippet. This is useful for: Standalone apps, static sites, and cached pages delivered by CDN APM apps that are not as closely coupled to the browser app as with a standard server-side app (for example, when your client-side app talks to a REST API back end) Enable single-page app (SPA) monitoring Enabling SPA requires a Pro + SPA browser agent subscription, and you may need to re-deploy the browser JavaScript agent. Use the REST API The REST API lets you manage deployment outside the browser UI. This is useful for large organizations deploying multiple apps. Use an APM agent API to manually instrument the JavaScript snippet For apps that are monitored by APM, you can use the APM agent's API to inject the JavaScript manually instead of automatically. Enable an APM-monitored app Use this procedure to automatically deploy the browser agent on an app that is monitored by APM: Go to one.newrelic.com, select Browser, and then select Add more data. In the Back-end, front-end, and mobile applications section, select the New Relic Browser tile. When prompted to select the account you want to add this instrumentation to, choose your account, and click Continue. From the Get started with New Relic Browser page, in the Choose a deployment method section, select Enable via New Relic APM. In the Choose your instrumentation section, select Lite, Pro, or Pro + SPA. In the Configure your instrumentation section, make the selections you want. In the Select your application section, type or use the search window to find an app's name. Click Enable. Important Node.js: To finish enabling the browser agent for a Node.js app, follow the additional procedure to insert the JavaScript header into the beginning of your HTML page's head tag. Generate some traffic for your app. Wait a few minutes for Browser to start collecting data, then select your app from the Browser applications index. Enable with copy/paste Use this procedure to insert browser's JavaScript snippet for browser monitoring into your app's webpages yourself. This option is useful for monitoring static sites (such as Jekyll) or cached pages delivered by CDN. Tip Near the bottom of the generated JavaScript is your browser license key and application ID. This is useful with the REST API and API Explorer. Go to one.newrelic.com, select Browser, and then select Add more data. In the Back-end, front-end, and mobile applications section, select the New Relic Browser tile. When prompted to select the account you want to add this instrumentation to, choose your account, and click Continue. From the Get started with New Relic Browser page, in the Choose a deployment method section, select Copy/Paste JavaScript Code. In the Choose your instrumentation section, select the type of agent: Lite, Pro, or Pro + SPA. In the Configure your instrumentation section, make the selections you want. In the Name your app section, name your app: If your app is monitored by APM, select Yes, then type or use the search window to find the app's name. If you have a standalone app for Browser (not monitored by APM), select No, then type the app's name. Click Enable. A new section, Instrument the agent, opens on the page with JavaScript code for your project. Copy the code snippet, then paste it inline into your pages as close to the top of the <head> element as possible, but after any position-sensitive <meta> tags (for example, X-UA-Compatible or charset information). For more information on the inline head placement, see JavaScript placement requirements. Generate some traffic for your app. Wait a few minutes for Browser to start collecting data, then select your app from the Browser applications index. If you use the copy/paste method, but don't finish the setup process, you can still view and copy the generated JavaScript snippet from your app's Browser Application settings page or by using the REST API (v2). Instrument webpages using the APM agent This information applies to apps that are also monitored by APM. New Relic's agents can instrument webpages with the required JavaScript for page load timing. If you use the APM agent to add the JavaScript snippet to your webpages, insert the instrumentation snippet as close to the top as possible. This allows you to take advantage of detailed information about browser's AJAX calls and JavaScript errors.

Make sure you have the minimum versions for your Browser, APM, and APM agents: Browser Pro + SPA, with distributed tracing enabled Browser agent version 1153 or higher Browser agent version 1158 or higher (required for cross-origin resource sharing) Browser agent version 1173 or higher (required for w3c trace context support) APM agent version: C SDK 1.3 or higher Java 5.9.0 or higher PHP 9.4.0 or higher Other APM agent version requirements Enable distributed tracing To enable distributed tracing for Browser monitoring: Make sure you meet requirements, including having: Full-Stack Observability Browser Pro with SPA enabled Go to one.newrelic.com, and click Browser > (select an app) > Settings > Application settings. Turn on the Distributed tracing toggle. By default, for agent version 1173 and above, the newrelic, traceparent, and tracestate headers will be added to all same-origin AJAX requests. Optional: If all of your services are configured to use the w3c trace context headers, you can choose to exclude the newrelic, traceparent, and tracestate headers from requests. Optional: Enable cross-origin resource sharing. Redeploy the Browser agent (either restarting the associated APM agent or updating the copy/paste Browser installation). Enable cross-origin resource sharing (CORS) If you have AJAX requests that need resources from different origins, you can enable cross-origin resource sharing (CORS). By default, distributed tracing for cross-origin requests is not enabled because of browser CORS security restrictions: Distributed tracing is implemented by adding a custom HTTP headers (newrelic, traceparent, and tracestate) to outgoing AJAX requests, and browsers typically do not allow custom headers on cross-origin requests. With the release of agent version 1173, we now support the w3c trace context headers (traceparent and tracestate) so these should also be allowed in your configuration. There are two separate configurations required to enable cross-origin distributed tracing: Configure the service on the different origin to accept the newrelic custom header Configure Browser monitoring to include the target origin in distributed tracing Our step-by-step instructions provide key concepts and steps to enable this feature, but if you need more background about how cross-origin resource sharing works, we recommend this Mozilla developer document. Risks and mitigations Caution Cross-origin resource sharing can expose you to a high level of risk if the services on the different origins are not configured correctly. The AJAX requests will likely return an error, resulting in a variety of failures, including: Resources failing to load (for example, images and key content) Login failures Entire site outages (depending on type of requests enabled) By enabling this cross-origin resource sharing feature, you are acknowledging the following: You understand that this feature is optional and not mandatory. You understand the steps you need to take in order to enable this feature for your services and your domains. You understand that if you do not properly configure your services prior to deployment (including but not limited to configuring your services on your domains to accept custom headers) portions or all of your website will likely malfunction. You understand that New Relic is neither responsible nor liable for errors or issues related to your misconfiguration of servers or services. You fully and solely accept the risks and wish to proceed. The best way to minimize your risk is to ensure you fully understand the process and to try it first in a test environment. Before reading the step-by-step instructions, it may help to first read this overview of the process: To use distributed tracing with cross-origin resources, you populate a list of approved cross-origin resources in New Relic, and then we automatically send the following custom headers to those resources: newrelic, traceparent, and tracestate. For this process to work, you must first ensure that someone has configured the services on the other origins to accept this custom header. Cross-origin resource sharing uses a variety of HTTP headers (both in the request and response). The header that specifically applies to New Relic is the Access-Control-Allow-Headers response header, which can include newrelic, traceparent, tracestate, or newrelic, traceparent, tracestate in its value depending on what tracing strategies you enabled in your APM-monitored application. You must configure your server to return this CORS header in its response. Example: Access-Control-Allow-Headers: newrelic, traceparent, tracestate Important New Relic cannot perform any validation to ensure the services on the other origins were configured correctly. If you're unsure about how to allow these headers, do not add cross-origin resources to the approved list in the New Relic UI. Enable cross-origin resource sharing Caution You should always try enabling CORS in a test environment before setting it up in production. To enable cross-origin resource sharing: Confirm that the services on the other origins are configured to accept the newrelic header using: Access-Control-Allow-Headers: newrelic, traceparent, tracestate (for details, see Risks and mitigations). Confirm that you meet the Browser monitoring requirements. Make sure you are in one.newrelic.com, and click Browser > (select an app) > Application settings. Turn on the Distributed tracing toggle if it's not already enabled. Turn on the Cross-origin resource sharing (CORS) toggle. Under Cross-origin resource sharing (CORS), add cross-origin resources to the approved list. Important Valid cross-origin resources must include: The prefix http:// or https:// The domain name The port number is not required unless it differs from the default for HTTP (port 80) or HTTPS (port 443). Select Save application settings to update the agent configuration. Redeploy the Browser agent (either restarting the associated APM agent or updating the copy/paste Browser installation). Find data Tips for finding and querying data: You can find end-user-originating traces in any New Relic One distributed tracing UI. In the distributed tracing UI, end-user spans are indicated with the icon. To see a span's attributes, select a span in the UI. Spans are reported as Span data, and can be queried in New Relic. Query tips: Query by browser app name by setting browserApp.name to the browser app name. Query for traces containing at least one browser app span with browserApp.name is not null. Query for traces containing at least one back-end app with appName is not null. Query for traces containing both browser and back-end spans by combining the two previous conditions.

      "body": "Problem You're looking for performance breakdowns for specific pages or endpoints on the browser monitoring Page views UI page or AJAX UI page. The UI doesn't show the URL group you're looking for, or it only shows / and /*. This behavior also appears in SPA data in BrowserInteraction events and applies to browserInteractionName, targetGroupedUrl, and previousGroupedUrl attributes. Solution Browser monitoring automatically \"learns\" to group your page views when your application is first deployed, and it adds that information to an allow list for URLs. Sometimes this grouping may not match your current page view information. To solve this problem, manage your application's URL segment list settings by editing existing rules or by adding the domains and URL segments that make up your site's URLs. After you add the necessary rules, you should see a useful breakdown of your information in the UI. Here are some useful tips: Adding segments to your allow list Tip Use constant URL segments. Only add the URL segments that remain constant across many page views. Do not add unique segments such as IDs or highly-specific categories, because this can lead to metric grouping issues. Enter exact matches. Enter any URL segments as exact matches, including case. Use existing rules. If a rule already appears for a domain: Go to one.newrelic.com > Browser > (select an app) > Settings > Segment allow lists. Rather than creating a new rule, edit the existing rule, and add the domain to the UI's Allow listed segments field. Group sub-domains. Group similar sub-domains such as foo.domain.com and bar.domain.com under *.domain.com. This grouping must occur just before the top-level domain name. Set up single-page apps. If your site is a single-page application and you only see / under page views, then your grouping is working correctly. New Relic records subsequent requests as AJAX loads, and your AJAX page will contain more detailed information. If it doesn't, then follow the tips in this document. Remove rules when appropriate. If you need to remove a rule, get support at support.newrelic.com.",

      "body": "Browser uses a JavaScript snippet (or \"agent\") to instrument your app's webpages. The JavaScript collects data for browser monitoring. To install the browser agent, you can choose from a number of deployment options. Tip To use Browser and the rest of our observability platform, join the New Relic family! Sign up to create your free account in only a few seconds. Then ingest up to 100GB of data for free each month. Forever. Select a deployment option No matter which option you use to deploy browser monitoring, the end result is to inject the browser agent's JavaScript snippet into your pages for browser monitoring. The method you select depends on your preferences and business needs. To view the procedure to install and enable the browser agent, click the link for the option you want to use. You can also use the Browser Application settings page to update settings. Important The following configuration options refer only to the browser monitoring agent. These are not the same as the New Relic user roles and editions. Browser deployment option Description Use the APM agent to inject the JavaScript You can use an APM agent to automatically inject the browser monitoring JavaScript snippet for you. This is the easiest way to install the agent for an app that already is being monitored by APM. (APM-monitored apps are listed on your APM Applications index.) Paste the JavaScript snippet into a webpage This allows you to control the exact placement of the JavaScript into your app's webpage(s) by copying and pasting the browser agent's JavaScript snippet. This is useful for: Standalone apps, static sites, and cached pages delivered by CDN APM apps that are not as closely coupled to the browser app as with a standard server-side app (for example, when your client-side app talks to a REST API back end) Enable single-page app (SPA) monitoring Enabling SPA requires a Pro + SPA browser agent subscription, and you may need to re-deploy the browser JavaScript agent. Use the REST API The REST API lets you manage deployment outside the browser UI. This is useful for large organizations deploying multiple apps. Use an APM agent API to manually instrument the JavaScript snippet For apps that are monitored by APM, you can use the APM agent's API to inject the JavaScript manually instead of automatically. Enable an APM-monitored app Use this procedure to automatically deploy the browser agent on an app that is monitored by APM: Go to one.newrelic.com, select Browser, and then select Add more data. In the Back-end, front-end, and mobile applications section, select the New Relic Browser tile. When prompted to select the account you want to add this instrumentation to, choose your account, and click Continue. From the Get started with New Relic Browser page, in the Choose a deployment method section, select Enable via New Relic APM. In the Choose your instrumentation section, select Lite, Pro, or Pro + SPA. In the Configure your instrumentation section, make the selections you want. In the Select your application section, type or use the search window to find an app's name. Click Enable. Important Node.js: To finish enabling the browser agent for a Node.js app, follow the additional procedure to insert the JavaScript header into the beginning of your HTML page's head tag. Generate some traffic for your app. Wait a few minutes for Browser to start collecting data, then select your app from the Browser applications index. Enable with copy/paste Use this procedure to insert browser's JavaScript snippet for browser monitoring into your app's webpages yourself. This option is useful for monitoring static sites (such as Jekyll) or cached pages delivered by CDN. Tip Near the bottom of the generated JavaScript is your browser license key and application ID. This is useful with the REST API and API Explorer. Go to one.newrelic.com, select Browser, and then select Add more data. In the Back-end, front-end, and mobile applications section, select the New Relic Browser tile. When prompted to select the account you want to add this instrumentation to, choose your account, and click Continue. From the Get started with New Relic Browser page, in the Choose a deployment method section, select Copy/Paste JavaScript Code. In the Choose your instrumentation section, select the type of agent: Lite, Pro, or Pro + SPA. In the Configure your instrumentation section, make the selections you want. In the Name your app section, name your app: If your app is monitored by APM, select Yes, then type or use the search window to find the app's name. If you have a standalone app for Browser (not monitored by APM), select No, then type the app's name. Click Enable. A new section, Instrument the agent, opens on the page with JavaScript code for your project. Copy the code snippet, then paste it inline into your pages as close to the top of the <head> element as possible, but after any position-sensitive <meta> tags (for example, X-UA-Compatible or charset information). For more information on the inline head placement, see JavaScript placement requirements. Generate some traffic for your app. Wait a few minutes for Browser to start collecting data, then select your app from the Browser applications index. If you use the copy/paste method, but don't finish the setup process, you can still view and copy the generated JavaScript snippet from your app's Browser Application settings page or by using the REST API (v2). Instrument webpages using the APM agent This information applies to apps that are also monitored by APM. New Relic's agents can instrument webpages with the required JavaScript for page load timing. If you use the APM agent to add the JavaScript snippet to your webpages, insert the instrumentation snippet as close to the top as possible. This allows you to take advantage of detailed information about browser's AJAX calls and JavaScript errors. For more information, see the instructions for your APM agent: C SDK Go Java .NET Node.js PHP Python Ruby Troubleshoot Browser agent installation When you enable browser Pro features for session traces, AJAX calls, or JavaScript errors, it may take approximately five minutes before information becomes available.

Rather than creating a new rule, edit the existing rule, and add the domain to the UI's Allow listed segments field. Group sub-domains. Group similar sub-domains such as foo.domain.com and bar.domain.com under *.domain.com. This grouping must occur just before the top-level domain name. Set up single-page apps. If your site is a single-page application and you only see / under page views, then your grouping is working correctly.

This document contains: Benefits of this feature Requirements Enable distributed tracing Enable cross-origin resource sharing (CORS) Find and query data Troubleshooting Tip Browser data is available in standard distributed tracing only, not Infinite Tracing. Benefits of browser data in distributed tracing By enabling New Relic to report browser data to distributed tracing, you can see the connection between front-end activity and back-end activity. You can see across a full transaction, from time spent by an end user in the web browser, to network activity, to associated back-end services. Benefits of this feature: Quickly spot latencies, errors, and anomalies in the browser or network Resolve customer-facing problems more quickly All the benefits of distributed tracing applied to your end-user monitoring Requirements and compatibility This feature reports AJAX requests (Fetch and XHR) that occur during a browser interaction. By default, only single-origin requests are monitored unless cross-origin resource sharing is enabled. Make sure you have the minimum versions for your Browser, APM, and APM agents: Browser Pro + SPA, with distributed tracing enabled Browser agent version 1153 or higher Browser agent version 1158 or higher (required for cross-origin resource sharing) Browser agent version 1173 or higher (required for w3c trace context support) APM agent version: C SDK 1.3 or higher Java 5.9.0 or higher PHP 9.4.0 or higher Other APM agent version requirements Enable distributed tracing To enable distributed tracing for Browser monitoring: Make sure you meet requirements, including having: Full-Stack Observability Browser Pro with SPA enabled Go to one.newrelic.com, and click Browser > (select an app) > Settings > Application settings. Turn on the Distributed tracing toggle. By default, for agent version 1173 and above, the newrelic, traceparent, and tracestate headers will be added to all same-origin AJAX requests. Optional: If all of your services are configured to use the w3c trace context headers, you can choose to exclude the newrelic, traceparent, and tracestate headers from requests. Optional: Enable cross-origin resource sharing. Redeploy the Browser agent (either restarting the associated APM agent or updating the copy/paste Browser installation). Enable cross-origin resource sharing (CORS) If you have AJAX requests that need resources from different origins, you can enable cross-origin resource sharing (CORS). By default, distributed tracing for cross-origin requests is not enabled because of browser CORS security restrictions: Distributed tracing is implemented by adding a custom HTTP headers (newrelic, traceparent, and tracestate) to outgoing AJAX requests, and browsers typically do not allow custom headers on cross-origin requests. With the release of agent version 1173, we now support the w3c trace context headers (traceparent and tracestate) so these should also be allowed in your configuration. There are two separate configurations required to enable cross-origin distributed tracing: Configure the service on the different origin to accept the newrelic custom header Configure Browser monitoring to include the target origin in distributed tracing Our step-by-step instructions provide key concepts and steps to enable this feature, but if you need more background about how cross-origin resource sharing works, we recommend this Mozilla developer document. Risks and mitigations Caution Cross-origin resource sharing can expose you to a high level of risk if the services on the different origins are not configured correctly. The AJAX requests will likely return an error, resulting in a variety of failures, including: Resources failing to load (for example, images and key content) Login failures Entire site outages (depending on type of requests enabled) By enabling this cross-origin resource sharing feature, you are acknowledging the following: You understand that this feature is optional and not mandatory. You understand the steps you need to take in order to enable this feature for your services and your domains. You understand that if you do not properly configure your services prior to deployment (including but not limited to configuring your services on your domains to accept custom headers) portions or all of your website will likely malfunction. You understand that New Relic is neither responsible nor liable for errors or issues related to your misconfiguration of servers or services. You fully and solely accept the risks and wish to proceed. The best way to minimize your risk is to ensure you fully understand the process and to try it first in a test environment. Before reading the step-by-step instructions, it may help to first read this overview of the process: To use distributed tracing with cross-origin resources, you populate a list of approved cross-origin resources in New Relic, and then we automatically send the following custom headers to those resources: newrelic, traceparent, and tracestate. For this process to work, you must first ensure that someone has configured the services on the other origins to accept this custom header. Cross-origin resource sharing uses a variety of HTTP headers (both in the request and response). The header that specifically applies to New Relic is the Access-Control-Allow-Headers response header, which can include newrelic, traceparent, tracestate, or newrelic, traceparent, tracestate in its value depending on what tracing strategies you enabled in your APM-monitored application. You must configure your server to return this CORS header in its response. Example: Access-Control-Allow-Headers: newrelic, traceparent, tracestate Important New Relic cannot perform any validation to ensure the services on the other origins were configured correctly. If you're unsure about how to allow these headers, do not add cross-origin resources to the approved list in the New Relic UI. Enable cross-origin resource sharing Caution You should always try enabling CORS in a test environment before setting it up in production. To enable cross-origin resource sharing: Confirm that the services on the other origins are configured to accept the newrelic header using: Access-Control-Allow-Headers: newrelic, traceparent, tracestate (for details, see Risks and mitigations). Confirm that you meet the Browser monitoring requirements. Make sure you are in one.newrelic.com, and click Browser > (select an app) > Application settings. Turn on the Distributed tracing toggle if it's not already enabled. Turn on the Cross-origin resource sharing (CORS) toggle. Under Cross-origin resource sharing (CORS), add cross-origin resources to the approved list. Important Valid cross-origin resources must include: The prefix http:// or https:// The domain name The port number is not required unless it differs from the default for HTTP (port 80) or HTTPS (port 443). Select Save application settings to update the agent configuration. Redeploy the Browser agent (either restarting the associated APM agent or updating the copy/paste Browser installation). Find data Tips for finding and querying data: You can find end-user-originating traces in any New Relic One distributed tracing UI. In the distributed tracing UI, end-user spans are indicated with the icon. To see a span's attributes, select a span in the UI. Spans are reported as Span data, and can be queried in New Relic. Query tips: Query by browser app name by setting browserApp.name to the browser app name. Query for traces containing at least one browser app span with browserApp.name is not null. Query for traces containing at least one back-end app with appName is not null. Query for traces containing both browser and back-end spans by combining the two previous conditions. Troubleshooting If you don't see end-user spans, or are having other distributed tracing issues, see Troubleshooting.",

Make sure you have the minimum versions for your Browser, APM, and APM agents: Browser Pro + SPA, with distributed tracing enabled Browser agent version 1153 or higher Browser agent version 1158 or higher (required for cross-origin resource sharing) Browser agent version 1173 or higher (required for w3c trace context support) APM agent version: C SDK 1.3 or higher Java 5.9.0 or higher PHP 9.4.0 or higher Other APM agent version requirements Enable distributed tracing To enable distributed tracing for Browser monitoring: Make sure you meet requirements, including having: Full-Stack Observability Browser Pro with SPA enabled Go to one.newrelic.com, and click Browser > (select an app) > Settings > Application settings. Turn on the Distributed tracing toggle. By default, for agent version 1173 and above, the newrelic, traceparent, and tracestate headers will be added to all same-origin AJAX requests. Optional: If all of your services are configured to use the w3c trace context headers, you can choose to exclude the newrelic, traceparent, and tracestate headers from requests. Optional: Enable cross-origin resource sharing. Redeploy the Browser agent (either restarting the associated APM agent or updating the copy/paste Browser installation). Enable cross-origin resource sharing (CORS) If you have AJAX requests that need resources from different origins, you can enable cross-origin resource sharing (CORS). By default, distributed tracing for cross-origin requests is not enabled because of browser CORS security restrictions: Distributed tracing is implemented by adding a custom HTTP headers (newrelic, traceparent, and tracestate) to outgoing AJAX requests, and browsers typically do not allow custom headers on cross-origin requests. With the release of agent version 1173, we now support the w3c trace context headers (traceparent and tracestate) so these should also be allowed in your configuration. There are two separate configurations required to enable cross-origin distributed tracing: Configure the service on the different origin to accept the newrelic custom header Configure Browser monitoring to include the target origin in distributed tracing Our step-by-step instructions provide key concepts and steps to enable this feature, but if you need more background about how cross-origin resource sharing works, we recommend this Mozilla developer document. Risks and mitigations Caution Cross-origin resource sharing can expose you to a high level of risk if the services on the different origins are not configured correctly. The AJAX requests will likely return an error, resulting in a variety of failures, including: Resources failing to load (for example, images and key content) Login failures Entire site outages (depending on type of requests enabled) By enabling this cross-origin resource sharing feature, you are acknowledging the following: You understand that this feature is optional and not mandatory. You understand the steps you need to take in order to enable this feature for your services and your domains. You understand that if you do not properly configure your services prior to deployment (including but not limited to configuring your services on your domains to accept custom headers) portions or all of your website will likely malfunction. You understand that New Relic is neither responsible nor liable for errors or issues related to your misconfiguration of servers or services. You fully and solely accept the risks and wish to proceed. The best way to minimize your risk is to ensure you fully understand the process and to try it first in a test environment. Before reading the step-by-step instructions, it may help to first read this overview of the process: To use distributed tracing with cross-origin resources, you populate a list of approved cross-origin resources in New Relic, and then we automatically send the following custom headers to those resources: newrelic, traceparent, and tracestate. For this process to work, you must first ensure that someone has configured the services on the other origins to accept this custom header. Cross-origin resource sharing uses a variety of HTTP headers (both in the request and response). The header that specifically applies to New Relic is the Access-Control-Allow-Headers response header, which can include newrelic, traceparent, tracestate, or newrelic, traceparent, tracestate in its value depending on what tracing strategies you enabled in your APM-monitored application. You must configure your server to return this CORS header in its response. Example: Access-Control-Allow-Headers: newrelic, traceparent, tracestate Important New Relic cannot perform any validation to ensure the services on the other origins were configured correctly. If you're unsure about how to allow these headers, do not add cross-origin resources to the approved list in the New Relic UI. Enable cross-origin resource sharing Caution You should always try enabling CORS in a test environment before setting it up in production. To enable cross-origin resource sharing: Confirm that the services on the other origins are configured to accept the newrelic header using: Access-Control-Allow-Headers: newrelic, traceparent, tracestate (for details, see Risks and mitigations). Confirm that you meet the Browser monitoring requirements. Make sure you are in one.newrelic.com, and click Browser > (select an app) > Application settings. Turn on the Distributed tracing toggle if it's not already enabled. Turn on the Cross-origin resource sharing (CORS) toggle. Under Cross-origin resource sharing (CORS), add cross-origin resources to the approved list. Important Valid cross-origin resources must include: The prefix http:// or https:// The domain name The port number is not required unless it differs from the default for HTTP (port 80) or HTTPS (port 443). Select Save application settings to update the agent configuration. Redeploy the Browser agent (either restarting the associated APM agent or updating the copy/paste Browser installation). Find data Tips for finding and querying data: You can find end-user-originating traces in any New Relic One distributed tracing UI. In the distributed tracing UI, end-user spans are indicated with the icon. To see a span's attributes, select a span in the UI. Spans are reported as Span data, and can be queried in New Relic. Query tips: Query by browser app name by setting browserApp.name to the browser app name. Query for traces containing at least one browser app span with browserApp.name is not null. Query for traces containing at least one back-end app with appName is not null. Query for traces containing both browser and back-end spans by combining the two previous conditions. Troubleshooting If you don't see end-user spans, or are having other distributed tracing issues, see Troubleshooting.",

      "body": "Problem You're looking for performance breakdowns for specific pages or endpoints on the browser monitoring Page views UI page or AJAX UI page. The UI doesn't show the URL group you're looking for, or it only shows / and /*. This behavior also appears in SPA data in BrowserInteraction events and applies to browserInteractionName, targetGroupedUrl, and previousGroupedUrl attributes. Solution Browser monitoring automatically \"learns\" to group your page views when your application is first deployed, and it adds that information to an allow list for URLs. Sometimes this grouping may not match your current page view information. To solve this problem, manage your application's URL segment list settings by editing existing rules or by adding the domains and URL segments that make up your site's URLs. After you add the necessary rules, you should see a useful breakdown of your information in the UI. Here are some useful tips: Adding segments to your allow list Tip Use constant URL segments. Only add the URL segments that remain constant across many page views. Do not add unique segments such as IDs or highly-specific categories, because this can lead to metric grouping issues. Enter exact matches. Enter any URL segments as exact matches, including case. Use existing rules. If a rule already appears for a domain: Go to one.newrelic.com > Browser > (select an app) > Settings > Segment allow lists. Rather than creating a new rule, edit the existing rule, and add the domain to the UI's Allow listed segments field. Group sub-domains. Group similar sub-domains such as foo.domain.com and bar.domain.com under *.domain.com. This grouping must occur just before the top-level domain name. Set up single-page apps. If your site is a single-page application and you only see / under page views, then your grouping is working correctly. New Relic records subsequent requests as AJAX loads, and your AJAX page will contain more detailed information. If it doesn't, then follow the tips in this document. Remove rules when appropriate. If you need to remove a rule, get support at support.newrelic.com.",

To install the browser agent, you can choose from a number of deployment options. Tip To use Browser and the rest of our observability platform, join the New Relic family! Sign up to create your free account in only a few seconds. Then ingest up to 100GB of data for free each month. Forever. Select a deployment option No matter which option you use to deploy browser monitoring, the end result is to inject the browser agent's JavaScript snippet into your pages for browser monitoring. The method you select depends on your preferences and business needs. To view the procedure to install and enable the browser agent, click the link for the option you want to use. You can also use the Browser Application settings page to update settings. Important The following configuration options refer only to the browser monitoring agent. These are not the same as the New Relic user roles and editions. Browser deployment option Description Use the APM agent to inject the JavaScript You can use an APM agent to automatically inject the browser monitoring JavaScript snippet for you. This is the easiest way to install the agent for an app that already is being monitored by APM. (APM-monitored apps are listed on your APM Applications index.) Paste the JavaScript snippet into a webpage This allows you to control the exact placement of the JavaScript into your app's webpage(s) by copying and pasting the browser agent's JavaScript snippet. This is useful for: Standalone apps, static sites, and cached pages delivered by CDN APM apps that are not as closely coupled to the browser app as with a standard server-side app (for example, when your client-side app talks to a REST API back end) Enable single-page app (SPA) monitoring Enabling SPA requires a Pro + SPA browser agent subscription, and you may need to re-deploy the browser JavaScript agent. Use the REST API The REST API lets you manage deployment outside the browser UI. This is useful for large organizations deploying multiple apps. Use an APM agent API to manually instrument the JavaScript snippet For apps that are monitored by APM, you can use the APM agent's API to inject the JavaScript manually instead of automatically. Enable an APM-monitored app Use this procedure to automatically deploy the browser agent on an app that is monitored by APM: Go to one.newrelic.com, select Browser, and then select Add more data. In the Back-end, front-end, and mobile applications section, select the New Relic Browser tile. When prompted to select the account you want to add this instrumentation to, choose your account, and click Continue. From the Get started with New Relic Browser page, in the Choose a deployment method section, select Enable via New Relic APM. In the Choose your instrumentation section, select Lite, Pro, or Pro + SPA. In the Configure your instrumentation section, make the selections you want. In the Select your application section, type or use the search window to find an app's name. Click Enable. Important Node.js: To finish enabling the browser agent for a Node.js app, follow the additional procedure to insert the JavaScript header into the beginning of your HTML page's head tag. Generate some traffic for your app. Wait a few minutes for Browser to start collecting data, then select your app from the Browser applications index. Enable with copy/paste Use this procedure to insert browser's JavaScript snippet for browser monitoring into your app's webpages yourself. This option is useful for monitoring static sites (such as Jekyll) or cached pages delivered by CDN. Tip Near the bottom of the generated JavaScript is your browser license key and application ID. This is useful with the REST API and API Explorer. Go to one.newrelic.com, select Browser, and then select Add more data.

The AJAX requests will likely return an error, resulting in a variety of failures, including: Resources failing to load (for example, images and key content) Login failures Entire site outages (depending on type of requests enabled) By enabling this cross-origin resource sharing feature, you are acknowledging the following: You understand that this feature is optional and not mandatory. You understand the steps you need to take in order to enable this feature for your services and your domains. You understand that if you do not properly configure your services prior to deployment (including but not limited to configuring your services on your domains to accept custom headers) portions or all of your website will likely malfunction. You understand that New Relic is neither responsible nor liable for errors or issues related to your misconfiguration of servers or services. You fully and solely accept the risks and wish to proceed. The best way to minimize your risk is to ensure you fully understand the process and to try it first in a test environment. Before reading the step-by-step instructions, it may help to first read this overview of the process: To use distributed tracing with cross-origin resources, you populate a list of approved cross-origin resources in New Relic, and then we automatically send the following custom headers to those resources: newrelic, traceparent, and tracestate. For this process to work, you must first ensure that someone has configured the services on the other origins to accept this custom header. Cross-origin resource sharing uses a variety of HTTP headers (both in the request and response). The header that specifically applies to New Relic is the Access-Control-Allow-Headers response header, which can include newrelic, traceparent, tracestate, or newrelic, traceparent, tracestate in its value depending on what tracing strategies you enabled in your APM-monitored application. You must configure your server to return this CORS header in its response. Example: Access-Control-Allow-Headers: newrelic, traceparent, tracestate Important New Relic cannot perform any validation to ensure the services on the other origins were configured correctly. If you're unsure about how to allow these headers, do not add cross-origin resources to the approved list in the New Relic UI. Enable cross-origin resource sharing Caution You should always try enabling CORS in a test environment before setting it up in production. To enable cross-origin resource sharing: Confirm that the services on the other origins are configured to accept the newrelic header using: Access-Control-Allow-Headers: newrelic, traceparent, tracestate (for details, see Risks and mitigations). Confirm that you meet the Browser monitoring requirements. Make sure you are in one.newrelic.com, and click Browser > (select an app) > Application settings. Turn on the Distributed tracing toggle if it's not already enabled. Turn on the Cross-origin resource sharing (CORS) toggle. Under Cross-origin resource sharing (CORS), add cross-origin resources to the approved list. Important Valid cross-origin resources must include: The prefix http:// or https:// The domain name The port number is not required unless it differs from the default for HTTP (port 80) or HTTPS (port 443). Select Save application settings to update the agent configuration. Redeploy the Browser agent (either restarting the associated APM agent or updating the copy/paste Browser installation). Find data Tips for finding and querying data: You can find end-user-originating traces in any New Relic One distributed tracing UI. In the distributed tracing UI, end-user spans are indicated with the icon. To see a span's attributes, select a span in the UI. Spans are reported as Span data, and can be queried in New Relic. Query tips: Query by browser app name by setting browserApp.name to the browser app name. Query for traces containing at least one browser app span with browserApp.name is not null. Query for traces containing at least one back-end app with appName is not null. Query for traces containing both browser and back-end spans by combining the two previous conditions. Troubleshooting If you don't see end-user spans, or are having other distributed tracing issues, see Troubleshooting.",

      "body": "Browser uses a JavaScript snippet (or \"agent\") to instrument your app's webpages. The JavaScript collects data for browser monitoring. To install the browser agent, you can choose from a number of deployment options. Tip To use Browser and the rest of our observability platform, join the New Relic family! Sign up to create your free account in only a few seconds. Then ingest up to 100GB of data for free each month. Forever. Select a deployment option No matter which option you use to deploy browser monitoring, the end result is to inject the browser agent's JavaScript snippet into your pages for browser monitoring. The method you select depends on your preferences and business needs. To view the procedure to install and enable the browser agent, click the link for the option you want to use. You can also use the Browser Application settings page to update settings. Important The following configuration options refer only to the browser monitoring agent. These are not the same as the New Relic user roles and editions. Browser deployment option Description Use the APM agent to inject the JavaScript You can use an APM agent to automatically inject the browser monitoring JavaScript snippet for you. This is the easiest way to install the agent for an app that already is being monitored by APM. (APM-monitored apps are listed on your APM Applications index.) Paste the JavaScript snippet into a webpage This allows you to control the exact placement of the JavaScript into your app's webpage(s) by copying and pasting the browser agent's JavaScript snippet. This is useful for: Standalone apps, static sites, and cached pages delivered by CDN APM apps that are not as closely coupled to the browser app as with a standard server-side app (for example, when your client-side app talks to a REST API back end) Enable single-page app (SPA) monitoring Enabling SPA requires a Pro + SPA browser agent subscription, and you may need to re-deploy the browser JavaScript agent. Use the REST API The REST API lets you manage deployment outside the browser UI. This is useful for large organizations deploying multiple apps. Use an APM agent API to manually instrument the JavaScript snippet For apps that are monitored by APM, you can use the APM agent's API to inject the JavaScript manually instead of automatically. Enable an APM-monitored app Use this procedure to automatically deploy the browser agent on an app that is monitored by APM: Go to one.newrelic.com, select Browser, and then select Add more data. In the Back-end, front-end, and mobile applications section, select the New Relic Browser tile. When prompted to select the account you want to add this instrumentation to, choose your account, and click Continue. From the Get started with New Relic Browser page, in the Choose a deployment method section, select Enable via New Relic APM. In the Choose your instrumentation section, select Lite, Pro, or Pro + SPA. In the Configure your instrumentation section, make the selections you want. In the Select your application section, type or use the search window to find an app's name. Click Enable. Important Node.js: To finish enabling the browser agent for a Node.js app, follow the additional procedure to insert the JavaScript header into the beginning of your HTML page's head tag. Generate some traffic for your app. Wait a few minutes for Browser to start collecting data, then select your app from the Browser applications index. Enable with copy/paste Use this procedure to insert browser's JavaScript snippet for browser monitoring into your app's webpages yourself. This option is useful for monitoring static sites (such as Jekyll) or cached pages delivered by CDN. Tip Near the bottom of the generated JavaScript is your browser license key and application ID. This is useful with the REST API and API Explorer. Go to one.newrelic.com, select Browser, and then select Add more data. In the Back-end, front-end, and mobile applications section, select the New Relic Browser tile. When prompted to select the account you want to add this instrumentation to, choose your account, and click Continue. From the Get started with New Relic Browser page, in the Choose a deployment method section, select Copy/Paste JavaScript Code. In the Choose your instrumentation section, select the type of agent: Lite, Pro, or Pro + SPA. In the Configure your instrumentation section, make the selections you want. In the Name your app section, name your app: If your app is monitored by APM, select Yes, then type or use the search window to find the app's name. If you have a standalone app for Browser (not monitored by APM), select No, then type the app's name. Click Enable. A new section, Instrument the agent, opens on the page with JavaScript code for your project. Copy the code snippet, then paste it inline into your pages as close to the top of the <head> element as possible, but after any position-sensitive <meta> tags (for example, X-UA-Compatible or charset information). For more information on the inline head placement, see JavaScript placement requirements. Generate some traffic for your app. Wait a few minutes for Browser to start collecting data, then select your app from the Browser applications index. If you use the copy/paste method, but don't finish the setup process, you can still view and copy the generated JavaScript snippet from your app's Browser Application settings page or by using the REST API (v2). Instrument webpages using the APM agent This information applies to apps that are also monitored by APM. New Relic's agents can instrument webpages with the required JavaScript for page load timing. If you use the APM agent to add the JavaScript snippet to your webpages, insert the instrumentation snippet as close to the top as possible. This allows you to take advantage of detailed information about browser's AJAX calls and JavaScript errors. For more information, see the instructions for your APM agent: C SDK Go Java .NET Node.js PHP Python Ruby Troubleshoot Browser agent installation When you enable browser Pro features for session traces, AJAX calls, or JavaScript errors, it may take approximately five minutes before information becomes available.

This document contains: Benefits of this feature Requirements Enable distributed tracing Enable cross-origin resource sharing (CORS) Find and query data Troubleshooting Tip Browser data is available in standard distributed tracing only, not Infinite Tracing. Benefits of browser data in distributed tracing By enabling New Relic to report browser data to distributed tracing, you can see the connection between front-end activity and back-end activity. You can see across a full transaction, from time spent by an end user in the web browser, to network activity, to associated back-end services. Benefits of this feature: Quickly spot latencies, errors, and anomalies in the browser or network Resolve customer-facing problems more quickly All the benefits of distributed tracing applied to your end-user monitoring Requirements and compatibility This feature reports AJAX requests (Fetch and XHR) that occur during a browser interaction. By default, only single-origin requests are monitored unless cross-origin resource sharing is enabled.

To install the browser agent, you can choose from a number of deployment options. Tip To use Browser and the rest of our observability platform, join the New Relic family! Sign up to create your free account in only a few seconds. Then ingest up to 100GB of data for free each month. Forever. Select a deployment option No matter which option you use to deploy browser monitoring, the end result is to inject the browser agent's JavaScript snippet into your pages for browser monitoring. The method you select depends on your preferences and business needs. To view the procedure to install and enable the browser agent, click the link for the option you want to use. You can also use the Browser Application settings page to update settings. Important The following configuration options refer only to the browser monitoring agent. These are not the same as the New Relic user roles and editions. Browser deployment option Description Use the APM agent to inject the JavaScript You can use an APM agent to automatically inject the browser monitoring JavaScript snippet for you. This is the easiest way to install the agent for an app that already is being monitored by APM. (APM-monitored apps are listed on your APM Applications index.) Paste the JavaScript snippet into a webpage This allows you to control the exact placement of the JavaScript into your app's webpage(s) by copying and pasting the browser agent's JavaScript snippet. This is useful for: Standalone apps, static sites, and cached pages delivered by CDN APM apps that are not as closely coupled to the browser app as with a standard server-side app (for example, when your client-side app talks to a REST API back end) Enable single-page app (SPA) monitoring Enabling SPA requires a Pro + SPA browser agent subscription, and you may need to re-deploy the browser JavaScript agent. Use the REST API The REST API lets you manage deployment outside the browser UI. This is useful for large organizations deploying multiple apps. Use an APM agent API to manually instrument the JavaScript snippet For apps that are monitored by APM, you can use the APM agent's API to inject the JavaScript manually instead of automatically. Enable an APM-monitored app Use this procedure to automatically deploy the browser agent on an app that is monitored by APM: Go to one.newrelic.com, select Browser, and then select Add more data. In the Back-end, front-end, and mobile applications section, select the New Relic Browser tile. When prompted to select the account you want to add this instrumentation to, choose your account, and click Continue. From the Get started with New Relic Browser page, in the Choose a deployment method section, select Enable via New Relic APM. In the Choose your instrumentation section, select Lite, Pro, or Pro + SPA. In the Configure your instrumentation section, make the selections you want. In the Select your application section, type or use the search window to find an app's name. Click Enable. Important Node.js: To finish enabling the browser agent for a Node.js app, follow the additional procedure to insert the JavaScript header into the beginning of your HTML page's head tag. Generate some traffic for your app. Wait a few minutes for Browser to start collecting data, then select your app from the Browser applications index. Enable with copy/paste Use this procedure to insert browser's JavaScript snippet for browser monitoring into your app's webpages yourself. This option is useful for monitoring static sites (such as Jekyll) or cached pages delivered by CDN. Tip Near the bottom of the generated JavaScript is your browser license key and application ID. This is useful with the REST API and API Explorer. Go to one.newrelic.com, select Browser, and then select Add more data. In the Back-end, front-end, and mobile applications section, select the New Relic Browser tile. When prompted to select the account you want to add this instrumentation to, choose your account, and click Continue. From the Get started with New Relic Browser page, in the Choose a deployment method section, select Copy/Paste JavaScript Code. In the Choose your instrumentation section, select the type of agent: Lite, Pro, or Pro + SPA. In the Configure your instrumentation section, make the selections you want. In the Name your app section, name your app: If your app is monitored by APM, select Yes, then type or use the search window to find the app's name. If you have a standalone app for Browser (not monitored by APM), select No, then type the app's name. Click Enable. A new section, Instrument the agent, opens on the page with JavaScript code for your project. Copy the code snippet, then paste it inline into your pages as close to the top of the <head> element as possible, but after any position-sensitive <meta> tags (for example, X-UA-Compatible or charset information). For more information on the inline head placement, see JavaScript placement requirements. Generate some traffic for your app. Wait a few minutes for Browser to start collecting data, then select your app from the Browser applications index. If you use the copy/paste method, but don't finish the setup process, you can still view and copy the generated JavaScript snippet from your app's Browser Application settings page or by using the REST API (v2). Instrument webpages using the APM agent This information applies to apps that are also monitored by APM. New Relic's agents can instrument webpages with the required JavaScript for page load timing. If you use the APM agent to add the JavaScript snippet to your webpages, insert the instrumentation snippet as close to the top as possible.

This document contains: Benefits of this feature Requirements Enable distributed tracing Enable cross-origin resource sharing (CORS) Find and query data Troubleshooting Tip Browser data is available in standard distributed tracing only, not Infinite Tracing. Benefits of browser data in distributed tracing By enabling New Relic to report browser data to distributed tracing, you can see the connection between front-end activity and back-end activity. You can see across a full transaction, from time spent by an end user in the web browser, to network activity, to associated back-end services. Benefits of this feature: Quickly spot latencies, errors, and anomalies in the browser or network Resolve customer-facing problems more quickly All the benefits of distributed tracing applied to your end-user monitoring Requirements and compatibility This feature reports AJAX requests (Fetch and XHR) that occur during a browser interaction. By default, only single-origin requests are monitored unless cross-origin resource sharing is enabled. Make sure you have the minimum versions for your Browser, APM, and APM agents: Browser Pro + SPA, with distributed tracing enabled Browser agent version 1153 or higher Browser agent version 1158 or higher (required for cross-origin resource sharing) Browser agent version 1173 or higher (required for w3c trace context support) APM agent version: C SDK 1.3 or higher Java 5.9.0 or higher PHP 9.4.0 or higher Other APM agent version requirements Enable distributed tracing To enable distributed tracing for Browser monitoring: Make sure you meet requirements, including having: Full-Stack Observability Browser Pro with SPA enabled Go to one.newrelic.com, and click Browser > (select an app) > Settings > Application settings. Turn on the Distributed tracing toggle. By default, for agent version 1173 and above, the newrelic, traceparent, and tracestate headers will be added to all same-origin AJAX requests. Optional: If all of your services are configured to use the w3c trace context headers, you can choose to exclude the newrelic, traceparent, and tracestate headers from requests. Optional: Enable cross-origin resource sharing. Redeploy the Browser agent (either restarting the associated APM agent or updating the copy/paste Browser installation). Enable cross-origin resource sharing (CORS) If you have AJAX requests that need resources from different origins, you can enable cross-origin resource sharing (CORS). By default, distributed tracing for cross-origin requests is not enabled because of browser CORS security restrictions: Distributed tracing is implemented by adding a custom HTTP headers (newrelic, traceparent, and tracestate) to outgoing AJAX requests, and browsers typically do not allow custom headers on cross-origin requests. With the release of agent version 1173, we now support the w3c trace context headers (traceparent and tracestate) so these should also be allowed in your configuration. There are two separate configurations required to enable cross-origin distributed tracing: Configure the service on the different origin to accept the newrelic custom header Configure Browser monitoring to include the target origin in distributed tracing Our step-by-step instructions provide key concepts and steps to enable this feature, but if you need more background about how cross-origin resource sharing works, we recommend this Mozilla developer document. Risks and mitigations Caution Cross-origin resource sharing can expose you to a high level of risk if the services on the different origins are not configured correctly. The AJAX requests will likely return an error, resulting in a variety of failures, including: Resources failing to load (for example, images and key content) Login failures Entire site outages (depending on type of requests enabled) By enabling this cross-origin resource sharing feature, you are acknowledging the following: You understand that this feature is optional and not mandatory. You understand the steps you need to take in order to enable this feature for your services and your domains. You understand that if you do not properly configure your services prior to deployment (including but not limited to configuring your services on your domains to accept custom headers) portions or all of your website will likely malfunction. You understand that New Relic is neither responsible nor liable for errors or issues related to your misconfiguration of servers or services. You fully and solely accept the risks and wish to proceed. The best way to minimize your risk is to ensure you fully understand the process and to try it first in a test environment. Before reading the step-by-step instructions, it may help to first read this overview of the process: To use distributed tracing with cross-origin resources, you populate a list of approved cross-origin resources in New Relic, and then we automatically send the following custom headers to those resources: newrelic, traceparent, and tracestate. For this process to work, you must first ensure that someone has configured the services on the other origins to accept this custom header. Cross-origin resource sharing uses a variety of HTTP headers (both in the request and response). The header that specifically applies to New Relic is the Access-Control-Allow-Headers response header, which can include newrelic, traceparent, tracestate, or newrelic, traceparent, tracestate in its value depending on what tracing strategies you enabled in your APM-monitored application. You must configure your server to return this CORS header in its response. Example: Access-Control-Allow-Headers: newrelic, traceparent, tracestate Important New Relic cannot perform any validation to ensure the services on the other origins were configured correctly. If you're unsure about how to allow these headers, do not add cross-origin resources to the approved list in the New Relic UI. Enable cross-origin resource sharing Caution You should always try enabling CORS in a test environment before setting it up in production. To enable cross-origin resource sharing: Confirm that the services on the other origins are configured to accept the newrelic header using: Access-Control-Allow-Headers: newrelic, traceparent, tracestate (for details, see Risks and mitigations). Confirm that you meet the Browser monitoring requirements. Make sure you are in one.newrelic.com, and click Browser > (select an app) > Application settings. Turn on the Distributed tracing toggle if it's not already enabled. Turn on the Cross-origin resource sharing (CORS) toggle. Under Cross-origin resource sharing (CORS), add cross-origin resources to the approved list. Important Valid cross-origin resources must include: The prefix http:// or https:// The domain name The port number is not required unless it differs from the default for HTTP (port 80) or HTTPS (port 443). Select Save application settings to update the agent configuration. Redeploy the Browser agent (either restarting the associated APM agent or updating the copy/paste Browser installation). Find data Tips for finding and querying data: You can find end-user-originating traces in any New Relic One distributed tracing UI. In the distributed tracing UI, end-user spans are indicated with the icon. To see a span's attributes, select a span in the UI. Spans are reported as Span data, and can be queried in New Relic. Query tips: Query by browser app name by setting browserApp.name to the browser app name. Query for traces containing at least one browser app span with browserApp.name is not null. Query for traces containing at least one back-end app with appName is not null. Query for traces containing both browser and back-end spans by combining the two previous conditions. Troubleshooting If you don't see end-user spans, or are having other distributed tracing issues, see Troubleshooting.",

Deployment via APM agent These troubleshooting steps apply to problems when the browser monitoring agent is installed on an app already being monitored by an APM agent: Enable your app Verify that browser monitoring has been enabled in your application's Browser settings: Go to one.newrelic.com > Browser > (select an app) > Settings. Follow standard procedures to enable browser settings for each app. Flush your webserver cache. Wait a few more minutes for data to arrive. Try the next steps if you still do not see any data. Update your APM agent More recent APM agents place the page load timing scripts more accurately. Before continuing with these troubleshooting tips, make sure you have the most recent release for your APM agent. Tip For agent version requirements for page load timing, see Compatibility and requirements. Verify the JavaScript snippets Check your page's source for the two script elements required to capture metrics and send them to New Relic. In a browser, view the source of your page, and look for a script element near the beginning like this: <script type=\"text/javascript\"> (window.NREUM||(NREUM={})).loader_config={xpid:\"VRUGVVJS\";window.NREUM||(NREUM={}),__nr_require=function a(b,c,d){ ... Copy OR like this: <script type=\"text/javascript\"> window.NREUM||(NREUM={}),__nr_require=function a (b,c,d){ ... Copy Also verify that a second script element exists in one of two locations, depending on the app server agent language. C SDK: n/a Go: n/a Java: Before the </body> tag (which must be added to the page if missing) .NET: Immediately before the first script element Node.js: Immediately before the first script element PHP: At the end of the body element Python: In the head element or at the end of the body element Ruby: Immediately before the first script element The second tag contains configuration and timing data, and looks like this: <script type=\"text/javascript\"> window.NREUM||(NREUM={});NREUM.info={\"beacon\":\"bam.nr-data.net\",\"errorBeacon\":\"bam.nr-data.net\"... Copy If either script element is missing, continue troubleshooting with the following steps. If the script elements are present and data does not appear after several minutes, get support at support.newrelic.com. Check other JavaScript error monitors If you see JavaScript errors on your webpage, or if you do not see any data on your JavaScript errors page in the New Relic UI, check if any other JavaScript error monitoring frameworks have been enabled for your app. Some JavaScript error monitors may interfere with functionality for browser monitoring. Configure auto-instrumentation If you are using New Relic's automatic instrumentation feature, ensure your agent is configured properly. Each agent has a configuration file setting and specific instructions to turn auto-instrumentation on or off: C SDK: n/a Go: n/a Java .NET Node.js agent: Currently not supported; see manual instrumentation procedures PHP Python Ruby Important If you modify your agent's configuration file, be sure to restart your app. Verify manual API instrumentation If you are manually calling the New Relic agent API to generate and insert the JavaScript, verify that the calls are actually being made. The APIs and how to use them are specific to your agent: C SDK: n/a Go: n/a Java agent .NET agent Node.js agent (see also the Node.js troubleshooting procedures) PHP agent Python agent Ruby agent Restart your APM app If you modified your APM agent's configuration file, be sure to restart your application so that it picks up the modified settings. Java agent: Flush the app server’s \"work\" cache. This forces the app server to recompile. .NET agent: Make sure your asp.net cache directory is clean by using the command flush_dotnet_temp.cmd. This forces the app server to recompile ASPs with page load timing instrumentation. Checkpoint: Verify JavaScript on page Verify that the JavaScript is on the page as detailed in the previous step Verify the JavaScript snippets. If it is not on the page, use the manual instrumentation as detailed in Verify manual API instrumentation. The Javascript must be present on your page before you can proceed to the next step. Verify end-user network access If your application is loaded primarily within a secured local network, ensure that your users can reach the necessary network endpoints to report browser data. This includes New Relic's CDNs and beacon. Deployment via JavaScript copy/paste These troubleshooting steps apply to problems when New Relic's browser monitoring agent was deployed using the HTML copy/paste method: Enable your app Verify that browser monitoring has been enabled in your application's Browser settings: Go to one.newrelic.com > Browser > (select an app) > Settings. Follow standard procedures to enable browser settings for each app. Flush your webserver cache. Wait a few more minutes for data to arrive. Try the next steps if you still do not see any data. Verify the JavaScript snippets Check your page's source for the script element required to capture metrics and send them to New Relic. In a browser, view the source of your page, and look for a script element near the beginning like this: <script type=\"text/javascript\"> window.NREUM||(NREUM={}),__nr_require=function a (b,c,d){ ... Copy If the script element is missing, make sure that you have pasted it in and deployed your new code. If you have not yet pasted in the JavaScript snippet, you can copy it again from your browser app's Settings page. If applicable, restart the application serving these pages. If you still don't see the script, continue troubleshooting with the following steps. Clear any cached versions of your pages For the Javascript snippets to appear in pages served by your application, ensure that any cached versions of the pages from before you added the code have been cleared. Check any CDN caches. Flush your webserver cache. Check the JavaScript placement and completeness Insert the JavaScript as close to the top of the HEAD as possible, but after any position-sensitive META tags (X-UA-Compatible and charset). It must be outside any comments. Here is an example of the general format: <!DOCTYPE html> <html> <head> <meta tags> {PLACE NEW RELIC SCRIPT TAG HERE} <script and link tags> </head> <body> ... </body> </html> Copy If the Javascript is correctly placed, compare it with the original snippet you generated to ensure it is complete and identical. Incomplete or modified snippets may not report correctly. Check other JavaScript error monitors If you see JavaScript errors on your webpage, or if you do not see any data on your JavaScript errors page in the New Relic UI, check if any other JavaScript error monitoring frameworks have been enabled for your app. Some JavaScript error monitors may interfere with functionality for browser monitoring. Verify end-user network access If your application is loaded primarily within a secured local network, ensure that your users can reach the necessary network endpoints to report browser data. This includes New Relic's CDNs and beacon. Razor framework: Check for a parser error message If you use the copy/paste installation method in a .NET app that uses the Razor Framework, this may result in the following error: Parser Error Message: \"\").pop().split(\"\" is not valid at the start of a code block. Only identifiers, keywords, comments, \"(\" and \"{\" are valid. Copy The error is caused by an @ symbol in theJavaScript snippet for browser monitoring . The @ symbol represents the beginning of a code block in Razor. The line that causes the problem is: .split(\"@\").pop().split(\":\") Copy To fix this issue, use one of these workarounds: Wrap the Browser JavaScript snippet in <text></text> tags to force it to be interpreted as content. OR Add another @ to the line to escape it. Check that the line looks like this: .split(\"@@\").pop().split(\":\") Copy Use only one of the workarounds. Using both will break the code again.",

      "body": "If you use Browser to monitor end-user browser activity, you can now see end-user-originating browser-side traces in distributed tracing. This document contains: Benefits of this feature Requirements Enable distributed tracing Enable cross-origin resource sharing (CORS) Find and query data Troubleshooting Tip Browser data is available in standard distributed tracing only, not Infinite Tracing. Benefits of browser data in distributed tracing By enabling New Relic to report browser data to distributed tracing, you can see the connection between front-end activity and back-end activity. You can see across a full transaction, from time spent by an end user in the web browser, to network activity, to associated back-end services. Benefits of this feature: Quickly spot latencies, errors, and anomalies in the browser or network Resolve customer-facing problems more quickly All the benefits of distributed tracing applied to your end-user monitoring Requirements and compatibility This feature reports AJAX requests (Fetch and XHR) that occur during a browser interaction. By default, only single-origin requests are monitored unless cross-origin resource sharing is enabled. Make sure you have the minimum versions for your Browser, APM, and APM agents: Browser Pro + SPA, with distributed tracing enabled Browser agent version 1153 or higher Browser agent version 1158 or higher (required for cross-origin resource sharing) Browser agent version 1173 or higher (required for w3c trace context support) APM agent version: C SDK 1.3 or higher Java 5.9.0 or higher PHP 9.4.0 or higher Other APM agent version requirements Enable distributed tracing To enable distributed tracing for Browser monitoring: Make sure you meet requirements, including having: Full-Stack Observability Browser Pro with SPA enabled Go to one.newrelic.com, and click Browser > (select an app) > Settings > Application settings. Turn on the Distributed tracing toggle. By default, for agent version 1173 and above, the newrelic, traceparent, and tracestate headers will be added to all same-origin AJAX requests. Optional: If all of your services are configured to use the w3c trace context headers, you can choose to exclude the newrelic, traceparent, and tracestate headers from requests. Optional: Enable cross-origin resource sharing. Redeploy the Browser agent (either restarting the associated APM agent or updating the copy/paste Browser installation). Enable cross-origin resource sharing (CORS) If you have AJAX requests that need resources from different origins, you can enable cross-origin resource sharing (CORS). By default, distributed tracing for cross-origin requests is not enabled because of browser CORS security restrictions: Distributed tracing is implemented by adding a custom HTTP headers (newrelic, traceparent, and tracestate) to outgoing AJAX requests, and browsers typically do not allow custom headers on cross-origin requests. With the release of agent version 1173, we now support the w3c trace context headers (traceparent and tracestate) so these should also be allowed in your configuration. There are two separate configurations required to enable cross-origin distributed tracing: Configure the service on the different origin to accept the newrelic custom header Configure Browser monitoring to include the target origin in distributed tracing Our step-by-step instructions provide key concepts and steps to enable this feature, but if you need more background about how cross-origin resource sharing works, we recommend this Mozilla developer document. Risks and mitigations Caution Cross-origin resource sharing can expose you to a high level of risk if the services on the different origins are not configured correctly. The AJAX requests will likely return an error, resulting in a variety of failures, including: Resources failing to load (for example, images and key content) Login failures Entire site outages (depending on type of requests enabled) By enabling this cross-origin resource sharing feature, you are acknowledging the following: You understand that this feature is optional and not mandatory. You understand the steps you need to take in order to enable this feature for your services and your domains. You understand that if you do not properly configure your services prior to deployment (including but not limited to configuring your services on your domains to accept custom headers) portions or all of your website will likely malfunction. You understand that New Relic is neither responsible nor liable for errors or issues related to your misconfiguration of servers or services. You fully and solely accept the risks and wish to proceed. The best way to minimize your risk is to ensure you fully understand the process and to try it first in a test environment. Before reading the step-by-step instructions, it may help to first read this overview of the process: To use distributed tracing with cross-origin resources, you populate a list of approved cross-origin resources in New Relic, and then we automatically send the following custom headers to those resources: newrelic, traceparent, and tracestate. For this process to work, you must first ensure that someone has configured the services on the other origins to accept this custom header. Cross-origin resource sharing uses a variety of HTTP headers (both in the request and response). The header that specifically applies to New Relic is the Access-Control-Allow-Headers response header, which can include newrelic, traceparent, tracestate, or newrelic, traceparent, tracestate in its value depending on what tracing strategies you enabled in your APM-monitored application. You must configure your server to return this CORS header in its response. Example: Access-Control-Allow-Headers: newrelic, traceparent, tracestate Important New Relic cannot perform any validation to ensure the services on the other origins were configured correctly. If you're unsure about how to allow these headers, do not add cross-origin resources to the approved list in the New Relic UI. Enable cross-origin resource sharing Caution You should always try enabling CORS in a test environment before setting it up in production. To enable cross-origin resource sharing: Confirm that the services on the other origins are configured to accept the newrelic header using: Access-Control-Allow-Headers: newrelic, traceparent, tracestate (for details, see Risks and mitigations). Confirm that you meet the Browser monitoring requirements. Make sure you are in one.newrelic.com, and click Browser > (select an app) > Application settings. Turn on the Distributed tracing toggle if it's not already enabled. Turn on the Cross-origin resource sharing (CORS) toggle. Under Cross-origin resource sharing (CORS), add cross-origin resources to the approved list. Important Valid cross-origin resources must include: The prefix http:// or https:// The domain name The port number is not required unless it differs from the default for HTTP (port 80) or HTTPS (port 443). Select Save application settings to update the agent configuration. Redeploy the Browser agent (either restarting the associated APM agent or updating the copy/paste Browser installation). Find data Tips for finding and querying data: You can find end-user-originating traces in any New Relic One distributed tracing UI. In the distributed tracing UI, end-user spans are indicated with the icon. To see a span's attributes, select a span in the UI. Spans are reported as Span data, and can be queried in New Relic. Query tips: Query by browser app name by setting browserApp.name to the browser app name. Query for traces containing at least one browser app span with browserApp.name is not null. Query for traces containing at least one back-end app with appName is not null. Query for traces containing both browser and back-end spans by combining the two previous conditions. Troubleshooting If you don't see end-user spans, or are having other distributed tracing issues, see Troubleshooting.",

      "body": "Problem You're looking for performance breakdowns for specific pages or endpoints on the browser monitoring Page views UI page or AJAX UI page. The UI doesn't show the URL group you're looking for, or it only shows / and /*. This behavior also appears in SPA data in BrowserInteraction events and applies to browserInteractionName, targetGroupedUrl, and previousGroupedUrl attributes. Solution Browser monitoring automatically \"learns\" to group your page views when your application is first deployed, and it adds that information to an allow list for URLs. Sometimes this grouping may not match your current page view information. To solve this problem, manage your application's URL segment list settings by editing existing rules or by adding the domains and URL segments that make up your site's URLs. After you add the necessary rules, you should see a useful breakdown of your information in the UI. Here are some useful tips: Adding segments to your allow list Tip Use constant URL segments. Only add the URL segments that remain constant across many page views. Do not add unique segments such as IDs or highly-specific categories, because this can lead to metric grouping issues. Enter exact matches. Enter any URL segments as exact matches, including case. Use existing rules. If a rule already appears for a domain: Go to one.newrelic.com > Browser > (select an app) > Settings > Segment allow lists. Rather than creating a new rule, edit the existing rule, and add the domain to the UI's Allow listed segments field. Group sub-domains. Group similar sub-domains such as foo.domain.com and bar.domain.com under *.domain.com. This grouping must occur just before the top-level domain name. Set up single-page apps. If your site is a single-page application and you only see / under page views, then your grouping is working correctly. New Relic records subsequent requests as AJAX loads, and your AJAX page will contain more detailed information. If it doesn't, then follow the tips in this document. Remove rules when appropriate. If you need to remove a rule, get support at support.newrelic.com.",

To install the browser agent, you can choose from a number of deployment options. Tip To use Browser and the rest of our observability platform, join the New Relic family! Sign up to create your free account in only a few seconds. Then ingest up to 100GB of data for free each month. Forever. Select a deployment option No matter which option you use to deploy browser monitoring, the end result is to inject the browser agent's JavaScript snippet into your pages for browser monitoring. The method you select depends on your preferences and business needs. To view the procedure to install and enable the browser agent, click the link for the option you want to use. You can also use the Browser Application settings page to update settings. Important The following configuration options refer only to the browser monitoring agent. These are not the same as the New Relic user roles and editions. Browser deployment option Description Use the APM agent to inject the JavaScript You can use an APM agent to automatically inject the browser monitoring JavaScript snippet for you. This is the easiest way to install the agent for an app that already is being monitored by APM. (APM-monitored apps are listed on your APM Applications index.) Paste the JavaScript snippet into a webpage This allows you to control the exact placement of the JavaScript into your app's webpage(s) by copying and pasting the browser agent's JavaScript snippet. This is useful for: Standalone apps, static sites, and cached pages delivered by CDN APM apps that are not as closely coupled to the browser app as with a standard server-side app (for example, when your client-side app talks to a REST API back end) Enable single-page app (SPA) monitoring Enabling SPA requires a Pro + SPA browser agent subscription, and you may need to re-deploy the browser JavaScript agent. Use the REST API The REST API lets you manage deployment outside the browser UI. This is useful for large organizations deploying multiple apps. Use an APM agent API to manually instrument the JavaScript snippet For apps that are monitored by APM, you can use the APM agent's API to inject the JavaScript manually instead of automatically. Enable an APM-monitored app Use this procedure to automatically deploy the browser agent on an app that is monitored by APM: Go to one.newrelic.com, select Browser, and then select Add more data. In the Back-end, front-end, and mobile applications section, select the New Relic Browser tile. When prompted to select the account you want to add this instrumentation to, choose your account, and click Continue. From the Get started with New Relic Browser page, in the Choose a deployment method section, select Enable via New Relic APM. In the Choose your instrumentation section, select Lite, Pro, or Pro + SPA. In the Configure your instrumentation section, make the selections you want. In the Select your application section, type or use the search window to find an app's name. Click Enable. Important Node.js: To finish enabling the browser agent for a Node.js app, follow the additional procedure to insert the JavaScript header into the beginning of your HTML page's head tag. Generate some traffic for your app. Wait a few minutes for Browser to start collecting data, then select your app from the Browser applications index. Enable with copy/paste Use this procedure to insert browser's JavaScript snippet for browser monitoring into your app's webpages yourself. This option is useful for monitoring static sites (such as Jekyll) or cached pages delivered by CDN. Tip Near the bottom of the generated JavaScript is your browser license key and application ID. This is useful with the REST API and API Explorer. Go to one.newrelic.com, select Browser, and then select Add more data. In the Back-end, front-end, and mobile applications section, select the New Relic Browser tile. When prompted to select the account you want to add this instrumentation to, choose your account, and click Continue. From the Get started with New Relic Browser page, in the Choose a deployment method section, select Copy/Paste JavaScript Code. In the Choose your instrumentation section, select the type of agent: Lite, Pro, or Pro + SPA. In the Configure your instrumentation section, make the selections you want. In the Name your app section, name your app: If your app is monitored by APM, select Yes, then type or use the search window to find the app's name. If you have a standalone app for Browser (not monitored by APM), select No, then type the app's name. Click Enable. A new section, Instrument the agent, opens on the page with JavaScript code for your project. Copy the code snippet, then paste it inline into your pages as close to the top of the <head> element as possible, but after any position-sensitive <meta> tags (for example, X-UA-Compatible or charset information). For more information on the inline head placement, see JavaScript placement requirements. Generate some traffic for your app. Wait a few minutes for Browser to start collecting data, then select your app from the Browser applications index. If you use the copy/paste method, but don't finish the setup process, you can still view and copy the generated JavaScript snippet from your app's Browser Application settings page or by using the REST API (v2). Instrument webpages using the APM agent This information applies to apps that are also monitored by APM. New Relic's agents can instrument webpages with the required JavaScript for page load timing. If you use the APM agent to add the JavaScript snippet to your webpages, insert the instrumentation snippet as close to the top as possible. This allows you to take advantage of detailed information about browser's AJAX calls and JavaScript errors.

      "body": "If you use Browser to monitor end-user browser activity, you can now see end-user-originating browser-side traces in distributed tracing. This document contains: Benefits of this feature Requirements Enable distributed tracing Enable cross-origin resource sharing (CORS) Find and query data Troubleshooting Tip Browser data is available in standard distributed tracing only, not Infinite Tracing. Benefits of browser data in distributed tracing By enabling New Relic to report browser data to distributed tracing, you can see the connection between front-end activity and back-end activity. You can see across a full transaction, from time spent by an end user in the web browser, to network activity, to associated back-end services. Benefits of this feature: Quickly spot latencies, errors, and anomalies in the browser or network Resolve customer-facing problems more quickly All the benefits of distributed tracing applied to your end-user monitoring Requirements and compatibility This feature reports AJAX requests (Fetch and XHR) that occur during a browser interaction. By default, only single-origin requests are monitored unless cross-origin resource sharing is enabled. Make sure you have the minimum versions for your Browser, APM, and APM agents: Browser Pro + SPA, with distributed tracing enabled Browser agent version 1153 or higher Browser agent version 1158 or higher (required for cross-origin resource sharing) Browser agent version 1173 or higher (required for w3c trace context support) APM agent version: C SDK 1.3 or higher Java 5.9.0 or higher PHP 9.4.0 or higher Other APM agent version requirements Enable distributed tracing To enable distributed tracing for Browser monitoring: Make sure you meet requirements, including having: Full-Stack Observability Browser Pro with SPA enabled Go to one.newrelic.com, and click Browser > (select an app) > Settings > Application settings. Turn on the Distributed tracing toggle. By default, for agent version 1173 and above, the newrelic, traceparent, and tracestate headers will be added to all same-origin AJAX requests. Optional: If all of your services are configured to use the w3c trace context headers, you can choose to exclude the newrelic, traceparent, and tracestate headers from requests. Optional: Enable cross-origin resource sharing. Redeploy the Browser agent (either restarting the associated APM agent or updating the copy/paste Browser installation). Enable cross-origin resource sharing (CORS) If you have AJAX requests that need resources from different origins, you can enable cross-origin resource sharing (CORS). By default, distributed tracing for cross-origin requests is not enabled because of browser CORS security restrictions: Distributed tracing is implemented by adding a custom HTTP headers (newrelic, traceparent, and tracestate) to outgoing AJAX requests, and browsers typically do not allow custom headers on cross-origin requests. With the release of agent version 1173, we now support the w3c trace context headers (traceparent and tracestate) so these should also be allowed in your configuration. There are two separate configurations required to enable cross-origin distributed tracing: Configure the service on the different origin to accept the newrelic custom header Configure Browser monitoring to include the target origin in distributed tracing Our step-by-step instructions provide key concepts and steps to enable this feature, but if you need more background about how cross-origin resource sharing works, we recommend this Mozilla developer document. Risks and mitigations Caution Cross-origin resource sharing can expose you to a high level of risk if the services on the different origins are not configured correctly. The AJAX requests will likely return an error, resulting in a variety of failures, including: Resources failing to load (for example, images and key content) Login failures Entire site outages (depending on type of requests enabled) By enabling this cross-origin resource sharing feature, you are acknowledging the following: You understand that this feature is optional and not mandatory. You understand the steps you need to take in order to enable this feature for your services and your domains. You understand that if you do not properly configure your services prior to deployment (including but not limited to configuring your services on your domains to accept custom headers) portions or all of your website will likely malfunction. You understand that New Relic is neither responsible nor liable for errors or issues related to your misconfiguration of servers or services. You fully and solely accept the risks and wish to proceed. The best way to minimize your risk is to ensure you fully understand the process and to try it first in a test environment. Before reading the step-by-step instructions, it may help to first read this overview of the process: To use distributed tracing with cross-origin resources, you populate a list of approved cross-origin resources in New Relic, and then we automatically send the following custom headers to those resources: newrelic, traceparent, and tracestate. For this process to work, you must first ensure that someone has configured the services on the other origins to accept this custom header. Cross-origin resource sharing uses a variety of HTTP headers (both in the request and response). The header that specifically applies to New Relic is the Access-Control-Allow-Headers response header, which can include newrelic, traceparent, tracestate, or newrelic, traceparent, tracestate in its value depending on what tracing strategies you enabled in your APM-monitored application. You must configure your server to return this CORS header in its response. Example: Access-Control-Allow-Headers: newrelic, traceparent, tracestate Important New Relic cannot perform any validation to ensure the services on the other origins were configured correctly. If you're unsure about how to allow these headers, do not add cross-origin resources to the approved list in the New Relic UI. Enable cross-origin resource sharing Caution You should always try enabling CORS in a test environment before setting it up in production. To enable cross-origin resource sharing: Confirm that the services on the other origins are configured to accept the newrelic header using: Access-Control-Allow-Headers: newrelic, traceparent, tracestate (for details, see Risks and mitigations). Confirm that you meet the Browser monitoring requirements. Make sure you are in one.newrelic.com, and click Browser > (select an app) > Application settings. Turn on the Distributed tracing toggle if it's not already enabled. Turn on the Cross-origin resource sharing (CORS) toggle. Under Cross-origin resource sharing (CORS), add cross-origin resources to the approved list. Important Valid cross-origin resources must include: The prefix http:// or https:// The domain name The port number is not required unless it differs from the default for HTTP (port 80) or HTTPS (port 443). Select Save application settings to update the agent configuration. Redeploy the Browser agent (either restarting the associated APM agent or updating the copy/paste Browser installation). Find data Tips for finding and querying data: You can find end-user-originating traces in any New Relic One distributed tracing UI. In the distributed tracing UI, end-user spans are indicated with the icon. To see a span's attributes, select a span in the UI. Spans are reported as Span data, and can be queried in New Relic. Query tips: Query by browser app name by setting browserApp.name to the browser app name. Query for traces containing at least one browser app span with browserApp.name is not null. Query for traces containing at least one back-end app with appName is not null. Query for traces containing both browser and back-end spans by combining the two previous conditions. Troubleshooting If you don't see end-user spans, or are having other distributed tracing issues, see Troubleshooting.",

      "body": "Problem You're looking for performance breakdowns for specific pages or endpoints on the browser monitoring Page views UI page or AJAX UI page. The UI doesn't show the URL group you're looking for, or it only shows / and /*. This behavior also appears in SPA data in BrowserInteraction events and applies to browserInteractionName, targetGroupedUrl, and previousGroupedUrl attributes. Solution Browser monitoring automatically \"learns\" to group your page views when your application is first deployed, and it adds that information to an allow list for URLs. Sometimes this grouping may not match your current page view information. To solve this problem, manage your application's URL segment list settings by editing existing rules or by adding the domains and URL segments that make up your site's URLs. After you add the necessary rules, you should see a useful breakdown of your information in the UI. Here are some useful tips: Adding segments to your allow list Tip Use constant URL segments. Only add the URL segments that remain constant across many page views. Do not add unique segments such as IDs or highly-specific categories, because this can lead to metric grouping issues. Enter exact matches. Enter any URL segments as exact matches, including case. Use existing rules. If a rule already appears for a domain: Go to one.newrelic.com > Browser > (select an app) > Settings > Segment allow lists. Rather than creating a new rule, edit the existing rule, and add the domain to the UI's Allow listed segments field. Group sub-domains. Group similar sub-domains such as foo.domain.com and bar.domain.com under *.domain.com. This grouping must occur just before the top-level domain name. Set up single-page apps. If your site is a single-page application and you only see / under page views, then your grouping is working correctly. New Relic records subsequent requests as AJAX loads, and your AJAX page will contain more detailed information. If it doesn't, then follow the tips in this document. Remove rules when appropriate. If you need to remove a rule, get support at support.newrelic.com.",

      "body": "Browser uses a JavaScript snippet (or \"agent\") to instrument your app's webpages. The JavaScript collects data for browser monitoring. To install the browser agent, you can choose from a number of deployment options. Tip To use Browser and the rest of our observability platform, join the New Relic family! Sign up to create your free account in only a few seconds. Then ingest up to 100GB of data for free each month. Forever. Select a deployment option No matter which option you use to deploy browser monitoring, the end result is to inject the browser agent's JavaScript snippet into your pages for browser monitoring. The method you select depends on your preferences and business needs. To view the procedure to install and enable the browser agent, click the link for the option you want to use. You can also use the Browser Application settings page to update settings. Important The following configuration options refer only to the browser monitoring agent. These are not the same as the New Relic user roles and editions. Browser deployment option Description Use the APM agent to inject the JavaScript You can use an APM agent to automatically inject the browser monitoring JavaScript snippet for you. This is the easiest way to install the agent for an app that already is being monitored by APM. (APM-monitored apps are listed on your APM Applications index.) Paste the JavaScript snippet into a webpage This allows you to control the exact placement of the JavaScript into your app's webpage(s) by copying and pasting the browser agent's JavaScript snippet. This is useful for: Standalone apps, static sites, and cached pages delivered by CDN APM apps that are not as closely coupled to the browser app as with a standard server-side app (for example, when your client-side app talks to a REST API back end) Enable single-page app (SPA) monitoring Enabling SPA requires a Pro + SPA browser agent subscription, and you may need to re-deploy the browser JavaScript agent. Use the REST API The REST API lets you manage deployment outside the browser UI. This is useful for large organizations deploying multiple apps. Use an APM agent API to manually instrument the JavaScript snippet For apps that are monitored by APM, you can use the APM agent's API to inject the JavaScript manually instead of automatically. Enable an APM-monitored app Use this procedure to automatically deploy the browser agent on an app that is monitored by APM: Go to one.newrelic.com, select Browser, and then select Add more data. In the Back-end, front-end, and mobile applications section, select the New Relic Browser tile. When prompted to select the account you want to add this instrumentation to, choose your account, and click Continue. From the Get started with New Relic Browser page, in the Choose a deployment method section, select Enable via New Relic APM. In the Choose your instrumentation section, select Lite, Pro, or Pro + SPA. In the Configure your instrumentation section, make the selections you want. In the Select your application section, type or use the search window to find an app's name. Click Enable. Important Node.js: To finish enabling the browser agent for a Node.js app, follow the additional procedure to insert the JavaScript header into the beginning of your HTML page's head tag. Generate some traffic for your app. Wait a few minutes for Browser to start collecting data, then select your app from the Browser applications index. Enable with copy/paste Use this procedure to insert browser's JavaScript snippet for browser monitoring into your app's webpages yourself. This option is useful for monitoring static sites (such as Jekyll) or cached pages delivered by CDN. Tip Near the bottom of the generated JavaScript is your browser license key and application ID. This is useful with the REST API and API Explorer. Go to one.newrelic.com, select Browser, and then select Add more data. In the Back-end, front-end, and mobile applications section, select the New Relic Browser tile. When prompted to select the account you want to add this instrumentation to, choose your account, and click Continue. From the Get started with New Relic Browser page, in the Choose a deployment method section, select Copy/Paste JavaScript Code. In the Choose your instrumentation section, select the type of agent: Lite, Pro, or Pro + SPA. In the Configure your instrumentation section, make the selections you want. In the Name your app section, name your app: If your app is monitored by APM, select Yes, then type or use the search window to find the app's name. If you have a standalone app for Browser (not monitored by APM), select No, then type the app's name. Click Enable. A new section, Instrument the agent, opens on the page with JavaScript code for your project. Copy the code snippet, then paste it inline into your pages as close to the top of the <head> element as possible, but after any position-sensitive <meta> tags (for example, X-UA-Compatible or charset information). For more information on the inline head placement, see JavaScript placement requirements. Generate some traffic for your app. Wait a few minutes for Browser to start collecting data, then select your app from the Browser applications index. If you use the copy/paste method, but don't finish the setup process, you can still view and copy the generated JavaScript snippet from your app's Browser Application settings page or by using the REST API (v2). Instrument webpages using the APM agent This information applies to apps that are also monitored by APM. New Relic's agents can instrument webpages with the required JavaScript for page load timing. If you use the APM agent to add the JavaScript snippet to your webpages, insert the instrumentation snippet as close to the top as possible. This allows you to take advantage of detailed information about browser's AJAX calls and JavaScript errors.
