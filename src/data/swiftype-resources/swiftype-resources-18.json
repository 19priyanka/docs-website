      "body": "You can't just hit the edit button docs.newrelic.com to make edits to the home page. The page that opens is index.js, the file that manages the parts of the home page, but not the content. It's rare that you'll need to make changes to this file. Most home page changes will be to add a new tile or section to the page, or update links. These types of changes are handled in two files: src/data/homepage.yml - contains home page section titles, section descriptions, and the URLs for tiles. src/i18n/translations/en/translation.json - contains tile info, including the title and short description of tiles. Update a link's URL Change or add new links using homepage.yml. In homepage.yml, search for the link you want to change. Edit the URL, save, commit, and PR the change. Add a new tile to the home page You'll make changes to both homepage.yml and translations.json On the translations.json doc, find the spot where you want to add the new tile (which section, and in what order you want it to appear), and add a new entry with this format: \"t#\": { \"title\": \"tile name\", \"description\": \"Short description.\" }, Copy Make sure you update the number on the tile. If you want to insert it in the middle of a group, update all the subsequent tile numbers as well. Save the file. Open homepage.yml, find the spot where the new tile will be, and add a new line with the relative link for the new tile. For example, - /docs/new-relic-one/use-new-relic-one/workloads/workloads-isolate-resolve-incidents-faster Save and check that your new tile builds properly on a local build. Commit, push, PR when you're ready. Add a new section to the home page On the translations.json page, add a new section modeled in the spot where you want the new section to appear. Include at least one title. For example, here's the TDP entry, with one tile: \"errors-inbox\": { \"title\": \"Errors Inbox\", \"description\": \"A single place to proactively detect, triage, and take action on all the errors before they impact customers.\", \"t1\": { \"title\": \"Introduction to Errors Inbox\", \"description\": \"How to manage all your monitoring in one place.\" }, Copy When you're done creating the info, save the file. In the homepage.yml page, find the corresponding location for the new section, and add the short name you provided in the translation.json file, title, description, and tile URLs. For example, here's the corresponding TDP section on homepage.yml. errors-inbox: title: Errors Inbox description: A single place to proactively detect, triage, and take action on all the errors before they impact customers. tiles: - /docs/errors-inbox/errors-inbox Copy Save, build locally, commit, PR. Edit the home page left nav The left nav of the home page is controlled by src/nav/root.yml. This is a basic yml file, similar to our taxonomy files. Each link on the left nav needs a title and a path: - title: Welcome to New Relic path: /docs/using-new-relic - title: New Relic One path: /docs/new-relic-one/use-new-relic-one - title: Guides and best practices path: /docs/new-relic-solutions - title: section-break - title: Alerts and Applied Intelligence path: /docs/alerts-applied-intelligence Copy You can add a new link by following the pattern above or delete a link by removing the corresponding title and path. Section breaks are added by including a - title: section-break line. The left nav reflects the exact order of root.yml, so it's easy to organize it as needed.",

For more information on related features, see our docs on Alerts notification channels, Incident Intelligence destinations, and Proactive Detection notifications. Alerts and Applied Intelligence notification integrations are specific services and platforms you can use to send notifications from New Relic. Integration details Read more about each of our specific notification integrations. Atlassian Jira Integrate New Relic with Atlassian Jira(Cloud) and automatically create and update Jira issues. Permissions The required permissions from the Jira API-Token are create, edit, and close tickets. To enable the two-way sync toggle, the provided Jira API-Key should have an Admin role. Set up a Jira destination Create Jira issues, then enable Jira and New Relic to share updates and stay synced. To create a Jira destination, enter the following information: Destination name: Custom name to identify the destination Jira account endpoint: the URL of the destination User-name: this will be the email address of the user making the connection API token: generated from your Atlassian account Important New Relic currently supports Atlassian-Jira Classic (company-managed) projects. Before saving the destination, we recommend you test the connection via the test connection button. Jira destination configuration. We recommand to test the connection before saving. Two-way sync You can enable a two-way integration with Jira to keep the issues' state synced with the corresponding state in New Relic. To enable two-way sync, turn on the ‘two-way integration’ toggle. When turned on, a Jira Webhook would be created in your Jira account at a later stage, for the selected project (see ‘customize a message template’). The webhook would contain access details to Newrelic (URL and Newrelic-API-KEY) Configure the message template To configure a template for a Jira issue, you first need to choose a destination. You will be able to create a new destination at this stage. Upon successful connection to the destination, you will need to choose a project, and then select the Jira issue type you would like to be used. Once the issue-type is selected, the configured project's fields are fetched from your account and automatically mapped to your Jira instance. To help you get started, we automatically present the required and recommended fields and values. Required fields must be set with a value. You can add or remove optional fields(use the X mark on their right side) Jira message template. Send a test notification You can see how the JIRA issue will appear by clicking a test notification with default field values. If successful, a JIRA issue will be created and a link will appear. ServiceNow (Incident-Management) Integrate New Relic with ServiceNow Incident-Management and automatically create and update incidents. Roles As part of the integrations, we fetch fields from the your serviceNow incident table and optional values. For this, the provided ServiceNow user details required read permissions for the tables: sys_dictionary, sys_choice, sys_user and task. A read/write permission to incident To be able to fetch users for the caller column, we required read permissions for the sys_users table. The above permissions can be achieved with the roles personalize_choices, personalize_dictionary, rest_service, itil. Read/Write permissions to the api_key_credentials table is required to enable two-way integration. This can be covered with the roles credentials_admin and discovery_admin. Set up a destination To create a ServiceNow destination, enter the following information: Destination Name: custom name to identify the destination Domain: the URL of the destination User-name: the name of the user Password: the user name’s password Before saving the destination, we recommend testing the connection by clicking the test connection button. Two-way sync You can configure a two-way integration with ServiceNow Incidents Management to keep the incidents' state synced with the corresponding state in New Relic. Here are some required steps to remember when configuring the two-way integration: Turn on the two-way integration toggle. Open and download this XML file, which includes the business rule triggering events back to New Relic One. In the ServiceNow sidebar menu, go to System Definition > Business Rules. Click the menu icon in one of the column headers, select Import XML and upload the XML file you downloaded. Once the Destination is saved, a New-Relic API-Key will be kept in the api_key_credentials. The key would sent in a header as part of the callback REST call to New-Relic Configure the message template Upon a successful connection, ServiceNow incident table columns are fetched from your account and automatically mapped to your ServiceNow instance. To help you get started, we automatically present the required and recommended fields and values. Required fields must be set with a value. You can add or remove optional fields(use the X mark on their right side) Select, edit or remove fields for the ServiceNow-Incident template. Send a test notification You can see how the ServiceNow incident will appear by clicking a test notification with default field values. If successful, an incident will be created and a link will appear. Slack Send notifications-messages to your Slack channels. Prerequisites Your Slack workspace needs to have the New Relic application installed. The application must be approved by a workspace admin before it can be individually installed by users Set up a Slack destination Click on the `one-click Slack authentication' will lead you to the Slack landing page to continue the OAuth2 authentication process. On the Slack landing page, if you're not signed into the required workspace, you're redirected to Slack to sign in. Add your workspace name or select the relevant workspace and click Continue. When signed in to the selected workspace, you are requested to allow New Relic to perform the specified actions. Clicking `Allow' will redirect you back to the Destination page. Configure the Slack message settings Select a Destination(Workspace) and select a Slack-channel where the messages will be sent. You can create a new destination if there is no pre-defined destination for the required workspace. Note that, for privacy reasons, users need to be authenticated to select private channels (one-time process) Send a test notification You can send a test notification with a pre-defined example payload to the channel. This creates a message in the selected Slack-channel. Webhook Use the webhook notifier to send the notification messages to any endpoint you like. Set up a webhook destination To create a webhook destination, you need the following: Destination Name: A unique destination name URL: the endpoint of the target application, authentication and custom headers if needed. Authorization mechanism (Optional):. Can be basic authentication or a bearer token Configure the webhook event template Pick a webhook destination from the list and configure the HTTP-POST request. The request configuration requires you to: Set a name for the template. Select a pre-configured destination from the destinations list or create a new one. Add custom headers (optional). Configure the request’s payload. Customize the webhook payload You can use the default payload or customize it to contain the required data. Pick Variables from the variables menu and apply handlebars syntax to enrich your webhook. Note that the request’s content-type is JSON by default. Hence, the payload needs to keep the JSON form. See Usage examples The ‘preview’ section on the right hand-side shows an expected payload after the template is rendered. If the eventual payload would not form a valid Json, an error will be shown and it won’t be possible to save the template. If the webhook payload conforms a valid Json, you can send a test notification to your defined webhook destination We recommend sending a test notification to make sure that everything's connected correctly. Email Send email notifications to users. Configure the email settings Add one or more recipients. Users with New Relic accounts can be found via autocomplete when searching for their name or email address. To add a user without a New Relic account or email distribution list, add the full email address. Every recipient will be translated into a 'destination'. You can follow the email notifications per destination in the notifications-log Send a test notification You can send a test notification to make sure the email notifications reach the inbox.",

      "body": "With secrets management, you can configure the agent and on-host integrations to use sensitive data (such as passwords) without having to write them as plain text into the configuration files. Currently, Hashicorp Vault, AWS KMS, CyberArk, and New Relic CLI obfuscation are supported. Learn more in this NerdBytes video (5:12 minutes). Define secrets To use secrets in a configuration YAML file: Define a variables section, where each entry is a name for a secret object. In each entry, include the source of the secret and the proper configuration to retrieve those secrets. In the general configuration section, set ${variable.property} placeholders that will be automatically replaced by the properties of the secret object. The secret object can be defined as a simple string or json object. Important If the secrets retrieval fails, the integration won't be executed, as the infrastructure agent does not have all the data it requires to execute. For example, the following configuration will retrieve an object named creds from Vault (you can define the object's name for the secret.) Let's assume that the stored object is a valid JSON with a property named user and another property named password. We want to use them to set the basic HTTP credentials of the status_url property from an Nginx on-host integration: integration_name: com.newrelic.nginx variables: creds: vault: http: url: http://my.vault.host/v1/newengine/data/secret headers: X-Vault-Token: my-vault-token instances: - name: nginx-server-metrics command: metrics arguments: status_url: http://${creds.user}:${creds.password}@example.com/status status_module: discover remote_monitoring: true labels: env: production role: load_balancer Copy Tip Both simple strings and valid JSON objects can be retrieved from variables. When using JSON objects make sure both keys and values are enclosed with double-quotes. Using environment variables Environment variables can be used into the variables section with the {{MY_ENV_VAR}} notation. When doing so, environment variables are expanded and their value is replaced at runtime. Use this method to avoid having sensitive values such as tokens or obfuscation keys included in the configuration file. When using environment variables in on-host integration configuration files the passthrough_environment setting must be defined. Secrets variables Define secrets in each configuration under a variables section. Each entry is a user-defined secret name that will store the properties of the retrieved secrets. Each variable can contain the following properties: YAML key Description ttl Type: String Amount of time before a secret is refreshed. This can be a number followed by a time unit (s, m or h). Examples: 30s, 10m, 1h Default: 1h aws-kms AWS KMS secret retrieval configuration vault Vault secret retrieval configuration cyberark-cli CyberArk command line interface configuration cyberark-api CyberArk REST API configuration obfuscated New Relic CLI obfuscation AWS KMS secrets To retrieve your secrets from Amazon KMS, you can set the following properties in your aws-kms section. Not all fields are required. For example, you will need either data, file, or http to provide the encoded KMS string. YAML key Description data Type: String Base64 encoded KMS string to decrypt file Type: String Path to file containing Base64 encoded KMS string to decrypt http Type: YAML properties HTTP configuration to use to request Base64 encoded KMS string to decrypt. For more information, see Vault http. credential_file Type: String Path to AWS credentials file config_file Type: String Path to AWS config file region Type: String AWS KMS region type Type: String (plain, equal, or json) Secret value format: plain: a raw string to be stored directly into the destination variable. equal: a key=property one-line string to be stored as object properties into the destination variable. json: a JSON object to be stored as properties into the destination variable. Secrets of type plain or json use dot notation; for example, ${mysecret.nestedkey}. The following example will allow retrieving a plain password string from AWS KMS. It must be decrypted from the provided data encoded string. variables: myPassword: aws-kms: data: T0hBSStGTEVY region: ap-southeast-2 credential_file: \"./my-aws-credentials-file\" config_file: \"./my-aws-config-file\" type: plain Copy Vault secrets Vault must enable an http field containing the HTTP configuration used to connect to Vault. The http entry can contain the following entries: YAML key Description url Type: String URL to request data from tls_config Type: YAML properties Use the TLS configuration properties headers Type: YAML map Request headers tls_config properties Important Secrets must use dot notation, for example, ${mysecret.nestedkey}. YAML key Description enable Type: Boolean Enable TLS Default: false insecure_skip_verify Type: Boolean Skip verifying server’s certificate chain and host Default: false min_version Type: UInt16 The minimum SSL/TLS version that is acceptable Default: 0 (which uses TLS version 1.0) max_version Type: UInt16 The maximum SSL/TLS version that is acceptable Default: 0 (which uses TLS version 1.3) ca Type: String TLS certificate \"\" The following example will retrieve a secret using a Vault token from a secured server, and skip the server certificates verification: variables: mydata: vault: http: url: https://my.vault.host/v1/newengine/data/secret headers: X-Vault-Token: my-vault-token tls_config: insecure_skip_verify: true Copy CyberArk command line interface To retrieve secrets from the CyberArk command line interface (CLI) use the following configuration, all keys are required YAML Key Description cli Type: string Full path to the CyberArk CLI executable Default: \"\" app-id Type: string Application id of the secret holder Default: \"\" safe Type: string Safe containing the secret Default: \"\" folder Type: string Folder containing the secret Default: \"\" object Type: string The object the secret is associated with Default: \"\" The following example will retrieve a CyberArk secret using the command line interface: variables: credentials: cyberark-cli: cli: /full/path/to/clipasswordsdk app-id: my-appid safe: my-safe folder: my-folder object: my-object Copy CyberArk REST API To retrieve secrets using the CyberArk REST API there must be a http key containing the HTTP configuration. The http key contains these sub-keys, only url is required: YAML key Description url Type: String URL to request data from, this key is required Default: none tls_config Type: YAML properties Use the TLS configuration properties headers Type: YAML map Request headers The following example will retrieve a secret using the CyberArk REST API, skipping server certificate verification: variables: credentials: cyberark-api: http: url: https://hostname/AIMWebService/api/Accounts?AppID=myAppID&Query=Safe=mySafe;Object=myObject tls_config: insecure_skip_verify: true Copy New Relic CLI Obfuscation Important We recommend using any of the supported secrets providers instead of the simple obfuscation when possible. See our guidelines below to define environment variables to avoid having the obfuscation key in configuration files. Use Powershell on Windows hosts, rather than the Command Prompt window, since the Command Prompt window can handle quotation marks in unexpected ways. Tip Infrastructure Agent 1.14.0 or above is required You can use the New Relic CLI obfuscate command to obscure sensitive information in the infrastructure agent or any on-host integration configuration file. Steps: Install the New Relic CLI on any host (it can be your development host). Run the CLI obfuscate command in order to generate the obfuscated value: newrelic agent config obfuscate --value '<plain_text_config_value>' --key '<obfuscation_key>' Copy Copy the result of the cli command into the text argument in the obfuscated section as shown in the examples below. You can obfuscate JSON blocks if you need to reference multiple values in your configuration YML file. Note that you may need to escape the quotation marks \"\" with backslashes on Windows hosts. For example: '{\\\"attribute\\\":\\\"value\\\".... In addition, use Powershell on Windows hosts, rather than the Command Prompt window, since the Command Prompt window can handle quotation marks in unexpected ways. newrelic agent config obfuscate --value '{\"attribute\":\"value\", \"attribute2\":\"value2\"}' --key '<obfuscation_key>' Copy YAML key Description key Type: String The string used when obfuscating the clear-text value using New Relic CLI Default: none secret Type: String The output of the newrelic-cli command Default: none Integrations configuration example The following example will allow retrieving the Nginx user and password that has been obfuscated using the New Relic CLI. This example uses dot notation when retrieving the credentials, since the obfuscated value was a JSON block: integration_name: com.newrelic.nginx variables: creds: obfuscated: key: 'random_key_used_in_cli' secret: 'obscured_output_from_cli' instances: - name: nginx-server-metrics command: metrics arguments: status_url: http://${creds.user}:${creds.password}@example.com/status status_module: discover remote_monitoring: true Copy It's recommended to use environment variables for the obfuscation arguments as shown in the example below: integration_name: com.newrelic.nginx variables: creds: obfuscated: key: {{OBFUSCATION_KEY}} secret: {{OBFUSCATION_TEXT}} instances: - name: nginx-server-metrics command: metrics arguments: status_url: http://${creds.user}:${creds.password}@example.com/status status_module: discover remote_monitoring: true Copy Agent configuration example This example allows retrieving a string that contains the proxy details (user, password and host): variables: obfuscated_proxy: obfuscated: key: 'random_key_used_in_cli' secret: 'obscured_output_from_cli' proxy: ${obfuscated_proxy} Copy",

      "body": "The New Relic Ruby agent automatically collects many metrics. It also includes an API you can use to collect additional metrics about your application. If you see large Application Code segments in transaction trace details, custom instrumentation can give a more complete picture of what is going on in your application. Tip Collecting too many metrics can impact the performance of your application and New Relic. To avoid data problems, keep the total number of unique metrics introduced by custom instrumentation under 2000. Method tracers The easiest way to capture custom instrumentation is by tracing calls to a particular method. Tracing a method as described below will insert an additional node in your transaction traces for each invocation of that method, providing greater detail about where time is going in your transactions. Method tracers are software probes you can put on a method of any class. The probes use module prepending to insert themselves when the target methods execute and gather custom instrumentation on their performance. Tracing in class definitions Method tracers can be used within normal class definitions, as long as the target method has been defined first: require 'new_relic/agent/method_tracer' class Foo include ::NewRelic::Agent::MethodTracer def generate_image ... end add_method_tracer :generate_image, 'Custom/generate_image' end Copy To instrument a class method, add the method tracer in the class singleton: require 'new_relic/agent/method_tracer' class Foo def self.generate_image ... end class << self include ::NewRelic::Agent::MethodTracer add_method_tracer :generate_image, 'Custom/generate_image' end end Copy add_method_tracer takes an optional metric name and a hash of options. For more information, see add_method_tracer in the New Relic RubyDoc . Tracing initializers Important This procedure does not work for Rails version 7 or higher. For Rails, a common way to add instrumentation is to create an initializer and \"monkey patch\" the instrumentation directives. For example, to add a method tracer to MyCache#get: Make sure the MyCache class is loaded before adding the method tracer. Add the following in a file named config/initializers/rpm_instrumentation.rb: require 'new_relic/agent/method_tracer' MyCache.class_eval do include ::NewRelic::Agent::MethodTracer add_method_tracer :get end Copy Tracing blocks of code Sometimes a single method is so complex that tracking overall time doesn't give enough detail. In these cases, you can wrap a block of code with a tracer. Call trace_execution_scoped passing the code to trace as a block: extend ::NewRelic::Agent::MethodTracer def slow_action self.class.trace_execution_scoped(['Custom/slow_action/beginning_work']) do # do stuff and report execution time with a custom metric name end # more stuff, whose time will be \"blamed\" to slow_action end Copy For more information, see add_method_tracer in the New Relic RubyDoc . Naming transactions Instrumented transactions are used to determine the throughput and overall response time for your application. The name of the method and the class will be used for the name of the transaction as reported to New Relic. For more information, see Viewing transaction traces. Normally the agent automatically chooses the transaction name. If you want to change the name of a transaction while it is still running, use NewRelic::Agent.set_transaction_name and the corresponding NewRelic::Agent.get_transaction_name. Important Do not use brackets [suffix] at the end of your transaction name. New Relic automatically strips brackets from the name. Instead, use parentheses (suffix) or other symbols if needed. This is useful if you want to segment your transaction based on some criteria. For example, if you wanted to vary the transaction name by response format in Rails: class UsersController def index @users = User.all respond_to do |format| format.html format.json do NewRelic::Agent.set_transaction_name('Users/index.json') render :json => @users end format.xml do NewRelic::Agent.set_transaction_name('Users/index.xml') render :xml => @users end end end end Copy Renaming transactions can also be used to segment your requests around some business criteria. For example, you could segment a transaction into \"Big Customer\" and \"Small Customer\" with code like this: class UsersController before_filter :segment_new_relic_by_customer_size def segment_new_relic_by_customer_size new_relic_name = NewRelic::Agent.get_transaction_name if current_user.big_customer? NewRelic::Agent.set_transaction_name(\"#{new_relic_name} - big customer\") else NewRelic::Agent.set_transaction_name(\"#{new_relic_name} - small customer\") end end end Copy Tracing transaction entry points Ordinarily the agent will be able to identify transactions within your application, but if you're not using a supported framework, or if you'd like to record transactions that the agent is not automatically recording, you can define methods as being transaction entry points: class Controller include NewRelic::Agent::Instrumentation::ControllerInstrumentation def transaction # execute a transaction end add_transaction_tracer :transaction end Copy Instrumenting non-web transactions Along with method-level tracing, you can instrument non-web transactions, such as background tasks, with the same level of transaction and error detail as web transactions. For more information, see Monitoring Ruby background processes and daemons. Advanced custom instrumentation When tracing code not automatically instrumented by the agent, the standard method tracers will usually be enough. However, sometimes you need to instrument something more complex than a single method call. For example, you may want to instrument a few lines of code within a method, or you may want to start a transaction in one part of your code and finish it elsewhere. The Tracer module, introduced in agent version 6.0, provides a flexible API that lets you create transactions and segments as well as interact with the current transaction. Instrumenting a section of code To instrument a section of code, wrap the code in a block, then pass the block to the Tracer.in_transaction method: require 'new_relic/agent/tracer' def long_and_complex_process expensive_setup Tracer.in_transaction(partial_name: 'Complex/process', category: :task) do code_to_be_instrumented end expensive_teardown end Copy The agent will ensure that a transaction exists, and will create a segment within it for the code inside the block. Starting a transaction or segment If you need to start a transaction at one location in your code but finish it in another (as can happen with callback-based events), call Tracer.start_transaction_or_segment. You must call finish on the return value of this method: require 'new_relic/agent/tracer' class MyEventWatcher def event_started @transaction = Tracer.start_transaction_or_segment( partial_name: 'MyEventWatcher/my_event', category: :task) end def event_completed @transaction.finish end end Copy For more information, see trace_execution_scoped in the New Relic RubyDoc.",

      "body": "Our automated user management allows allows you to import and configure your New Relic users from your identity provider via SCIM. This guide provides Azure AD-specific details on how to configure the New Relic Azure AD SCIM/SSO application. Requirements Before using this guide, read the requirements and procedure overview. Note that these instructions require going back and forth between your identity provider and New Relic. Step 1. Create authentication domain and enable SCIM For how to get to the New Relic authentication domain UI, see Authentication domain. If you don't already have one, create a new authentication domain for your SCIM-provisioned users by clicking + Add new. For that authentication domain, under Source of users, select SCIM. Copy and save the API token for later use. Note that this will be shown only once. Step 2. Set up Azure's New Relic app Next, you'll set up Azure's New Relic SAML/SCIM app. Azure AD provides an application gallery, which includes various integrations for Azure AD, including the ones that New Relic offers. To set this up: Go to the Azure Active Directory admin center, and sign in if necessary. aad.portal.azure.com/ Click on All services in the left hand menu. In the main pane, click on Enterprise applications. Click on +New Application. Find our SCIM/SSO application by entering New Relic in the name search box, and click on the application New Relic by organization (not New Relic by account). Click on Add. Step 3. Configure connection Configure the New Relic SCIM/SSO application to automatically provision your users to New Relic. From the New Relic SCIM/SSO application page, click on the Provisioning link in the sidebar. In the main pane, click on Get started. In the Provisioning Mode pick-list, choose Automatic. In New Relic's authentication domain UI, set up a new domain with SCIM enabled. In Azure AD's New Relic SCIM/SSO app, in the Admin credentials section, fill out the Tenant URL and Secret token fields with the values provided in New Relic's authentication domain UI. To verify you can connect to New Relic, click Test Connection. When you see a message indicating verification success, click Save. The New Relic SCIM/SSO application can now connect with New Relic. Continue with the following section to configure the provisioning rules. Step 4. Configure provisioning rules Initially, nothing is configured to be sent to New Relic. You must configure Azure AD to send changes for user creation, updates, and deactivation. Go to the Provisioning page and complete the following: Expand the Mappings section. Click Provision Azure Active Directory Users. Verify the Target Object Actions Create Update and Delete checkboxes are all checked. Verify the Attribute Mappings look correct for your environment. Each of the New Relic attributes shown in the list must receive a value. Tip Ensure that the Azure Active Directory attributes shown in the list on the left are good sources for the information to send to New Relic. In particular, not all environments set the mail attribute. If your environment does not set the mail attribute, userPrincipalName could be a good alternative. Leave the switch for Enabled set to Off until you're done with the user and group configuration in the next section. Once all configuration is ready, return to this page and set the switch to On. Click Save. Here's an example of a filled-in attribute mapping page with the default values. Your values may be configured differently depending on your situation. After saving the provisioning rules, the New Relic SCIM/SSO application is ready to provision any changes made to users assigned to the application. Continue with the following section to assign users and groups to the New Relic SCIM/SSO application. Step 5. Set your users' user type When your users are provisioned in New Relic, you're able to see them in the User management UI. If you're adding users to New Relic via SCIM but not managing their user type via SCIM, they start out as basic users. To convert users to full platform users, you have two options: Use the User management UI to edit users. Configure the Azure app to manage user type. Step 6. Assign access grants Once these steps are completed, you should be able to see your users in New Relic by going to the User management UI. Now that your users are present in New Relic, you must grant them access to specific roles on specific accounts. If this is not done, your users don't yet have access to New Relic. To learn how to do this, see: How access grants work The user management tutorial Step 7. Configure SAML SSO To enable SAML SSO for your users, see the SAML instructions.",

      "body": "Overview Digital customer experience is your end user’s experience across all your digital touch points. There are four core factors that impact a user’s experience: Availability (Is it reachable?) Performance (Does it perform well enough to be usable?) Content quality (Does it have what users need and can they find it?) Product and content relevance (Does it have what users care about?) Digital customer experience includes web, mobile, and IoT. The first version of this guide is focused on measuring the end user web experience. Quality Foundation is about creating a standard practice to help you understand your digital customer experience in a meaningful way. This implementation guide will help you: Look at customer experience in relation to: Global functions, such as search and login Lines of business Regions Report back to business stakeholders on what they care about Prioritize what you work on Create a repeatable practice Desired Outcome Improve customer engagement and retention by measuring and improving performance in a way that better aligns to the end user experience. Key Performance Indicators Quality Foundation measures the following KPIs: Availability This KPI measures whether or not your application or its pages can be accessed by your users Goal: Improve uptime and availablity Thresholds: < 99% warning < 95% critical 99% or \"2 9's\" is a good minimum standard of availability, even for employee applications or sub-pages. We configure these default thresholds into the dashboards. You can easily change this to better suit expectations for your application. Largest contentful paint (LCP) Part of Core Web Vitals. Largest Contentful Paint (LCP) measures the time it takes to load the largest image after a user has navigated to a new page. Goal: Reduce LCP to 2.5 seconds or better for the 75% percentile for all pages or at least the most critical pages. Thresholds: Warning: > 2.5 seconds Critical: > 4.0 seconds LCP thresholds are defined by the team at Google. The thresholds and the supporting logic behind them can be found here. First input delay (FID) Part of Core Web Vitals. Measures the interactivity of a page by tracking the time between user interaction (such as clicking a link or entering text) when the browser begins processing the event. Goal: Reduce FID to 100 milliseconds or better for the 75% percentile for all pages or at least the most critical pages. Thresholds: Warning: > 100 milliseconds Critical: > 300 milliseconds FID thresholds are defined by the team at Google. The thresholds and the supporting logic behind them can be found here. Cumulative layout shift (CLS) Part of Core Web Vitals. Measures how much the page layout shifts during render. Goal: Maintain a score of 0.1 or less for the 75% percentile for all pages or at least the most critical pages. Thresholds: Warning: > 0.1 score Critical: > 0.25 score CLS thresholds are defined by the team at Google. The thresholds and the supporting logic behind them can be found here. Time to first byte (TTFB) This KPI measures the time from navigation start (a user clicking a link) to the browser receiving the first byte of the response from the server. Google considers TTFB secondary to Core Web Vitals. We recommend measuring it for a more complete picture. It can be revealing if you see a change in LCP, because it answers the question as to whether the change occurred server side or client side. Goal: Reduce the time to first byte by improving CDN, network, and service performance. Thresholds: Warning > 0.5 seconds Critical > 1.0 seconds According to Google and Search Engine People, 500 milliseconds is a decent TTFB for pages with dynamic content. You can find mention of these recommendations here. Ajax response times Slow ajax calls can make the user feel as though nothing is happening or the page is broken. If the response time is slow enough, users may even abandon the journey. Goal: Measure and improve ajax response times. Thresholds: Warning > 2 seconds Critical > 2.5 seconds These thresholds come from experience with customers across a variety of industries. HTTP error rate HTTP errors (or HTTP 4xx and 5xx responses) happen when calls to the backend are not successful. Goal: Measure and reduce the HTTP error rate to ensure your customers are able to do what they came to your site to do. Thresholds: Warning < 99% of requests are successful Critical < 97% of requests are successful These thresholds come from experience with customers across a variety of industries. We made the assumption that every ajax request is associated with something the user is trying to achieve and treat it accordingly. Because users will often retry failed actions, we allowed for space between warning and critical thresholds. If the ajax requests being measured are an important part of the user journey, we recommended aiming for higher success rates, such as 99.5% or 99.9%. If the ajax requests are tied to login requests, separate 4xx response codes from 5xx response codes and set a much lower threshold for the 4xx responses. You can look to historical response code rates to determine a reasonable threshold. JavaScript error rate This KPI measures the number of JavaScript errors per page view. Goal: Remove irrelevant JavaScript errors being tracked either by tuning ingest or using filtering. Reduce JavaScript errors that impact customer performance. Thresholds: Warning: > 5% errors per page view Critical: > 10% errors per page view These thresholds come from experience with customers across a variety of industries. For each KPI, we defined thresholds - one for warning, another for critical. You might ask where these values come from or how you can be sure they should apply to your application. Our thresholds are the ones recommended by Google (as with Core Web Vitals) or by us, based on our experience across a large number of customers and applications. If you feel strongly that they should be different, you can adjust them, but you should do this at the organizational level rather than on an application by application basis. Quality Foundation helps you identify where in your application you need to make improvements that will optimize user retention, conversion and satisfaction. It is less about where things are and more about where to get to. It also shows you what you should be measuring going forward. You can use this to define SLOs (in a service level dashboard) and alert on them. Prerequisites Required knowledge Familiarity with synthetic monitoring Familiarity with browser monitoring Familiarity with basic Browser UI views Familiarity with SPA data in Browser UI Required Installation and Configuration Browser Pro installed in all pages SPA enabled for single page applications Synthetics monitors configured: Ping monitors configured for anonymous users Scripted synthetics check configured for login flow Monitors should be configured to test from all regions applicable to your users Monitors should be configured for each domain and each login flow Data retention for browser events greater than or equal to 2x an average sprint Establish current state Review instrumented pages Validate Browser URL grouping Understand how you will segment your data Import the quality foundation dashboard Capture current performance for each dashboard page Review instrumented pages Review Browser apps and pages to make sure that everything you expect to report back to New Relic is. You can do this by reviewing the Page Views tab in the Browser UI or running the following query: SELECT uniques(pageUrl) from PageView LIMIT MAX Copy You may need to filter out URLs that contain request or customer ID. Validate Browser URL grouping Ensure Browser segments are captured correctly so user experience performance is measurable in both the NewRelic UI as well as at the aggregate level when querying via NRQL. A segment is the text between two / in a URL or between . of a domain name. For example, in the URL website.com/product/widget-name, the segments are: website .com product widget-name When there are a lot of URLs with a lot of segments, URLs can get crushed, so that website.com/product/widget-name becomes website.com/ or website.com/product/. In this example, the first crushed URL is not particularly useful, but the second one may be a useful way of aggregating customer experience data for the product. Not sure whether you need to tune your configuration? Import the Segment Allow List Investigation dashboard in GitHub to help. Once you’ve identified which segments to add, you can add them using Segment allow lists in Browser. Understand how you will segment your data Make Customer Experience data understandable and actionable by breaking it out into different segments. In this case, segments refer to groups of data. It does not refer to sections of URLs, as in segment allow lists. Consider the following statements: Most of our users experience 3 seconds or better to first input delay. On average, we see 2 seconds to the largest contentful paint. Last week, there were 1 million page views. Compared to: Most of the users in the US, Canada, and EMEA experience 2 seconds or better to first input delay. Malaysia and Indonesia users experience 4 seconds; we are looking into this. Customers buying car insurance typically see 1 second to largest contentful paint. For home insurance, it’s 4 seconds. Last week, there were 700,000 page views on mobile browser apps compared to 300,000 on desktop. Let’s make sure we’re optimizing our mobile experience. Typical segmentation involves breaking down user experience into the following categories: Segment Guidance Region/Location Basic: Group by country. Browser events automatically contain the country code of requests, so there is nothing you need to do to break it out further. Advanced: Make regional grouping match regional SLO groups by creating your own region attribute using custom attributes in Browser. Facet by countryCode.

Advanced: Add product offering as a custom attribute to browser pages using custom attributes. Environment During instrumentation or afterwards, follow a naming convention that specifies the environment in Browser. Well named browser apps specify product and/or function as well as environment. Examples: account-management.prod hotels-book.prod car-insurance.uat Using app naming conventions to specify the environment supports filtering data in both the UI and in dashboards. For more information, see the documentation for how to rename Browser apps. Team In some organizations, a single team supports multiple products, while in others, a product is big enough to be supported by multiple teams. Report on team performance against customer experience or engagement by either adding the team name to the Browser app name (for example, account-management.prod.unicorn-squad) or by using custom attributes. Import the quality foundation dashboard This step creates the dashboard that you will use to measure your customer experience and improve it. Clone the GitHub repository. Follow the GitHub repository README instructions to implement the dashboard. Make sure to align the dashboard to lines of business or customer facing offerings rather than teams. This ensures optimization time is spent where it is most impactful. Capture current performance for each dashboard page Follow the GitHub README instructions. Use the dashboard from the previous step to understand the overall performance for each line of business. If relevant, apply filters to see performance across region or device. If values drop below targets and it matters, add it to the sheet as a candidate for improvement. Not worth tracking: A company that sells insurance in the US only notices poor performance in Malaysia. Worth tracking: A company that sells insurance in the US only notices poor performance with respect to mobile users in the US. Improvement Process Plan your work Decide which KPIs to improve Improve targeted KPIs Improve page load performance Improve AJAX response times Improve the AJAX error rate Improve JavaScript errors Plan your work Whether you have a dedicated initiative to improve performance or classifying as ongoing maintenance, you need to track your progress at the end of every sprint. Decide which KPIs to improve You now know what your user experience looks like across multiple lines of business. Where should you be improving? Start with business priorities. If you have clear business directives or have access to a senior manager above who does, you should focus on what matters most to your organization. For example, let’s say your company has recently launched a new initiative around a line of business but the KPIs associated with the UI are below target. This is where you should focus time initially. Next, focus on KPIs for each line of business. Finally, filter each line of business by device, region, etc., to see if additional focus is needed for specific regions or devices. Improve targeted KPIs To track your progress, create a new dashboard or add a new page to the existing dashboard and name it Quality Foundation KPI Improvement. For more information, see Improve Web Uptime. Improve page load performance Narrow your focus to specific pages that aren’t meeting target KPI values. For each page load KPI result that is out of bounds in the Quality Foundation Dashboard, remove the COMPARE WITH clause and add FACET pageUrl/targetGroupedUrl LIMIT MAX to find which pages are the poor performers. Use targetGroupedUrl when there are many results; for example, when the customer ID is part of the URL. Otherwise, use pageUrl. Original Dashboard query: FROM PageViewTiming SELECT percentile(largestContentfulPaint, 75) WHERE appName ='WebPortal' AND pageUrl LIKE '%phone%' SINCE 1 week AGO COMPARE WITH 1 week AGO Copy New query to identify problem pages: FROM PageViewTiming SELECT percentile(largestContentfulPaint, 75) WHERE appName ='WebPortal' AND pageUrl LIKE '%phone%' FACET targetGroupedUrl LIMIT MAX Copy Once you have identified which pages to improve, improve them following these best practices. Improve AJAX response times Find the slow requests. Go to the Ajax duration widget on the dashboard. View query, then open in query builder. Add facet requestUrl LIMIT MAX to the end of the query. Run the query. View the results as a table and save to your KPI Improvement dashboard as LOB - AjaxResponseTimes. Focus improving requests with a timeToSettle > 2.5s. Use New Relic’s recommended best practices to improve response times. See AJAX troubleshooting tips. Improve the AJAX error rate Find the failing requests. Go to Dashboards > Query builder. Enter FROM AjaxRequest SELECT percentage(count(*), WHERE httpResponseCode >= 400) WHERE httpResponseCode >= 200 AND <Ajax Request filter> SINCE 1 week AGO facet pageUrl, appName Copy Run the query. View the results as a table and save to your KPI Improvement dashboard as LOB - Pages with AjaxErrors. Run the query again for the most problematic pages to find the requests that are failing: FROM AjaxRequest SELECT percentage(count(*), WHERE httpResponseCode >= 400) WHERE httpResponseCode >= 200 AND pageUrl=<problematic page> AND appName = <corresponding app> <Ajax Request filter> SINCE 1 week AGO facet requestUrl Copy Use New Relic’s recommended best practices to improve response times. See AJAX troubleshooting tips. Improve JavaScript errors Find the most common failures. Go to Dashboards > Query builder Enter FROM JavaScriptError SELECT count(errorClass) SINCE 1 week AGO WHERE <PageView filter> FACET transactionName, errorClass, errorMessage, domain Copy Run the query. View the results as a table and save to your KPI Improvement dashboard as LOB - Javascript Errors. Use this information to figure out which errors need to be addressed Use New Relic’s recommended best practices to resolve errors that need addressing. See JavaScript errors page: Detect and analyze errors. Remove third party errors that do not add value. You may be using a third party JavaScript that is noisy but works as expected. You can take a couple of approaches: Remove the domain name from the JavaScript error/Pageview ratio widget and add it as its own widget so you can see unexpected changes. You can alert on this using Baseline NRQL alerts. Drop the JavaScript error using drop filters. Only use this option if the volume of errors is impacting your data ingest in a significant way. Be as specific as you can in the drop filter. Conclusion Best practices to adopt Revisit performance metrics (shared in this document as Quality Foundation KPIs) at the end of each sprint. Incorporate performance improvements into developer sprints. Openly share metrics with the lines of the business you support as well as other internal stakeholders. Define Customer Experience SLOs. Create alerts for business critical drops in Quality Foundation KPIs. Value Realization At the end of this process you should now: Have an understanding of your end user experience in a way that is tangible, actionable, and easy for engineers as well as the business to understand. Know how releases impact your end customers. Know how your customers are impacted by service, infrastructure, or network level events. See latency issues caused by backend services if they exist. Have created, or be on the path to create, a common language with business owners so you are working together. This can open new avenues for recognition and sponsorship for new projects.",

      "body": "Overview IT Operations is expected to provide services that meet the business’s requirements for performance and reliability. However, many ops teams attempt to measure performance and reliability using legacy methods, like measuring resource consumption. That, in turn, requires that they create complex dashboards of granular metrics which they then try to correlate with application performance and reliability. These complex dashboards require subject matter experts to interpret the results for business stakeholders. Legacy methods create barriers to understanding what a good system state looks like and how bad system states impact the business. Essentially, IT ends up not sharing a common metric vocabulary with the business. This fundamental disconnect will result in the perception that IT is not able to deliver the services that the business requires, with all the implications and impacts that perception carries. Service Level Management (SLM) eliminates that disconnect by better explaining the overall performance of a system in terms that are easily understood by both IT and the business. The intent is to show whether or not the system is meeting its performance and reliability expectations, and if it is trending toward or away from improvement, so proactive steps can be taken. The end goal is that systems are better oriented toward desired business outcomes with IT’s attention focused on issues in areas with the highest business impact. You are a good candidate for SLM if any of the following are true: The business impact of performance and reliability issues are not well understood by all stakeholders. Your MTTx is too high. You are collecting many resource consumption metrics (such as CPU, disk, or memory) or are maintaining many metric correlation rules in order to identify system problems. You can’t see the value of your observability tool(s). Desired outcome Service Level Management’s overall goal is to easily measure and communicate the overall health, performance, and quality of your digital products and services to all stakeholders. By implementing SLM at key output points in your systems, you will have a simpler and more responsive observability practice, tighter alignment with the business, and faster paths to improvement. The SLM process described in this guide will help you to identify the points in your systems where you should measure the key performance metrics of service performance and quality. It will also define and drive a simpler alerting strategy, continuous improvement methodologies, and improved problem resolution workflows. Key performance indicators You will use the SLM process to collect and measure the following KPIs, often referred to as the “Golden Signals”: Service response time Service response time measures the amount of time a service requires to process a transaction. It starts when a transaction request is received by the service and ends when the response is sent. Goal: Reduce transaction response time. Best practices: Measure response time at service boundaries. Use continuous improvement processes to drive down response times. Ensure that non-business transactions (such as health checks) are not included or measured. Map this KPI back to business impact. Report KPIs to all stakeholders. Service quality Service quality is the number of transactions that result in an unhandled error. Typically, these are transactions whose HTTP response code is greater than or equal to 400. Goal: Reduce the number of unhandled errors. Best practices: Measure error rates at service boundaries. Continually identify and remediate sources of high error volumes. Map this KPI back to business impact. Report KPIs to all stakeholders. Service level objective attainment SLO attainment is the percentage of time a business service is meeting its response time and quality goals. Goal: Improve response time and quality to ensure high SLO attainment. Best practices: Use continuous improvement processes to maintain / improve SLO attainment. Map this KPI back to business impact. Report KPIs to all stakeholders. Service uptime Service uptime is the percentage of time a service can be reached by at least one client. Typically this is measured using synthetic transactions from representative remote locations. Goal: Use continuous improvement processes to watch uptime metrics and take appropriate steps to ensure uptime meets business requirements. Best practices: Use continuous improvement processes to maintain / improve SLO attainment. Map this KPI back to business impact Report KPIs to all stakeholders. These KPIs directly measure the most important aspects of an IT service, speed and quality, in a way that is easy and intuitive to understand and communicate to technical and non-technical stakeholders. Prerequisites Before you begin, if you don’t have equivalent experience, you should complete the New Relic University (NRU) Overview Course. You should also have a basic understanding of: New Relic One APM and infrastructure monitoring New Relic One Dashboards and NRQL New Relic One alerting best practices Establish current state As with any continuous improvement process, the first step of SLM is to establish the current state of your KPIs. To do so, you will need to perform the following tasks: Determine in-scope services Identify service boundaries Deploy instrumentation Perform SLM educational workshops Analyze KPIs and set baseline SLOs Establish / optimize Alerting Build problem resolution workflows Execute continuous improvement review To help illustrate this process, we are going to apply it to an example IT service, an ecommerce site for a cellular telephone provider. Determine in-scope services You should first identify the IT services that are going to be in-scope for the initial iteration of the SLM process. These services should be key to ongoing business operations and as close to your customers as possible. Most commonly, you will be applying the SLM process to an application, since that is the service your customers are expecting you to deliver. SLM can be applied to infrastructure-based services; however, it is a more advanced application of SLM which is applicable to a much smaller set of organizations. If you are considering implementing SLM for infrastructure, you should ensure that the service(s) you are instrumenting are actually the closest to your organization’s end-customer. If your infrastructure is hosting a customer-facing app, then the app should be the target of SLM. Absent anything else, a good methodology for identifying in-scope services is to consult your disaster recovery plan. Typically, the most critical business services are prioritized there. Identify service boundaries Next, you should identify each service’s boundary, which is the service component that is closest to the client sending transaction requests. This should be the application receiving the request from the client, browser, or mobile device, and may also be known as the \"external API.\" Reverse proxies, CDNs, and load balancers are not part of the service boundary. Their service level compliance should be measured via the Uptime KPI (external test requests for connectivity). If your services are using APM, you can identify service boundaries using the service map or dependencies features. A service component is on a boundary if it has no inbound connections. In the example below (from a service map), you can see that the WebPortal is on the boundary. An example of using service maps in New Relic One to identify service boundaries. In contrast, the following screenshot (from the dependencies page) shows that the Inventory Service is not on a boundary since it has incoming connections from the WebPortal. Subsequent examples in this guide will build on the WebPortal service boundary. An example of using the dependencies UI in New Relic One to identify service boundaries. You should understand that the SLM process defines a service boundary as being downstream of any dependencies. The service boundary is the point where all the effects and impacts of dependent services are measured as they contribute to the total response time and quality of the service. By measuring service level compliance at the boundary, you will be able to see the impact that all service components upstream of the boundary have on service delivery. This means that your initial steps into SLM can focus on the services that are closest to your users, yet still capture the contribution of more distant services. As your practice matures, you will be able to identify the next round of upstream services that would benefit from direct SLM instrumentation. In our example, the WebService is downstream of the Fulfillment, Plan, Promo, Login, and Inventory services (among others). By applying SLM at the WebService, we will be seeing the impact of the upstream services on the WebService. Any impactful issues with an upstream service will be reflected in the WebService’s service level KPIs. By instrumenting one service, we are capturing the contribution of five additional services. This greatly simplifies our observability practice. In time, problematic upstream services will self-identify themselves as candidates for direct SLM instrumentation. Deploy instrumentation To collect SLM service response time and transaction success KPIs, you need to deploy instrumentation into the components of your production apps on the service boundary. If you don’t have instrumentation that can do this in production already, then you will need to engage the teams and stakeholders that can help you to get this done. For detailed information on deploying the New Relic instrumentation that can gather this information, see our APM install documentation. The uptime KPIs can be collected using synthetic transactions, which don’t require any instrumentation to be added to the service. If needed, you can start your SLM journey there while waiting for the direct instrumentation to be deployed. The uptime tests should perform a basic, yet realistic, check of the service’s functionality. For detailed information on this capability, see our synthetic monitoring documentation. Perform SLM educational workshops You should share the self-paced New Relic Essentials training course with the appropriate stakeholders so they can understand how the New Relic technology platform will aid in the SLM process. Analyze KPIs and set baseline SLOs The SLM process uses speed and quality as its key performance indicators. In technical terms, speed means response time and quality means error rate. At the end of this phase, you will have created baseline service level objectives for each service in the form of a percentage. For example: “98% of service X’s transactions will be error free and occur in less than 500 milliseconds.” For each in-scope service, you should analyze speed and quality at the service boundary. This will give you an overall understanding of how the entire service and all of its dependencies are performing. As you iterate through the SLM process, you can then identify and prioritize the upstream service components that require direct SLM instrumentation. To analyze KPIs, you should do the following for each service: Identify the volume and 95th percentile response time for each of the service’s transactions over a relatively long period of time, typically between seven days and one month. It is important that you use percentile rather than average, so you can see the entire range of response times, including outliers. If you use averages, you will hide outliers. The following is an example of the initial baseline report. Here you can see the volume, p95 response time, and error volume for the WebPortal and a few other services. The WebPortal’s p95 response time is .36 seconds (or 36 milliseconds), so we have decided to set the SLO target to 0.4 seconds. Example of an initial baseline report measuring volume and 95th percentile response time. Next you should review and identify any non-business transactions, since they should not be included in the SLO attainment calculation. For example, you should not include health check / keep alive transactions and you may not want to include administrative transactions. In the example below, we are looking at some of the transactions from the WebPortal service. We have decided that the about.jsp transaction is a non-business transaction that should not be tracked in our SLO attainment calculation. Example showing transaction breakdowns from the initial baseline report to help identify what to track (or not track) for SLO. Finally, import and edit the SLM template dashboard to exclude non-business transactions. Then use the p95 response time as your baseline response time service level objective. For the example chart, we chose 0.4 seconds as our response time threshold and set our service level objective to 95%. This means that we are expecting 95% of the WebPortal’s business transactions to complete in 0.4 seconds or less and without an error. The red line on the chart shows us our 95% service level objective. Example chart now excluding the non-business transactions. As you can see, there are periods of hours where the app is not meeting its SLOs. If we are going to maintain the 95% target, we would need to identify and fix the service components or dependencies that are causing these problems. Establish or optimize alerting After you have set your service level objectives, you will then configure alerts that will inform you when your SLO attainment has dipped below your goal. These alerts will show you when incidents with a high business impact are occurring. When they are triggered, they should be given a high priority and you should engage the proper teams to start the process of diagnosing the source of the problem. A basic starting point is to configure an alert that triggers when your SLO attainment has dipped under your baseline for more than 10 minutes. For more information, see our documentation on configuring alerts. Build problem resolution workflows As we’ve been discussing, the intent of the SLM process is to identify when business impacting issues occur in your IT services. When this occurs, a diagnostic investigation should be launched. The goal of the investigation is to identify what service element is causing the business impacting issue. SLM tells you that there is a problem with business impact, the diagnostic process helps you to find where the problem is. Typically, your high level diagnostic workflow will start at the service boundary and go as follows: Look at the service’s individual transactions and see which one(s) are departing from their performance and/or response time SLOs. Look at each service component responsible for delivering that transaction until you find the component that is failing. Use in-depth diagnostics to identify the root cause of the problem and then resolve it. Execute continuous improvement review This is an ongoing phase of the SLM process where data is reviewed and adjustments are made as required. Your KPIs should be reported to upper management to ensure that stakeholder teams are appropriately prioritizing work and that you are meeting the SLO goals you’ve set. Periodic KPIs should be recorded and retained over periods of months to years to establish a baseline and to show the rate of improvement. In addition, each time you execute the continuous improvement process, you should: Review each service’s architecture to ensure your instrumentation is deployed at the boundary and that there are no observabilty gaps. Review each service’s transactions to confirm that only business transactions are included in your SLO calculations. Review each service’s SLO and determine if it meets the business’s performance and quality requirements. If it does not, then the SLO should be changed and the appropriate stakeholders notified so they can work to improve performance and quality. Review your SLO attainment and determine if any upstream services should be added to the SLM process. Next steps After you’ve established the SLM process, you should identify other services that would benefit from SLM instrumentation. These may be other front-line services or upstream dependencies of services that are covered by SLOs that have shown themselves to be frequent contributors to SLO attainment failures. As you do this, you should start to measure and report your SLM coverage as a percentage of applications covered by SLOs. For example, you may say that 20% of your apps have established SLOs. As SLM expands into your organization and as its value is seen by management and other stakeholders, you may find that you need a dedicated team to manage the SLM process. The SLM process should also become a primary driver to help you prioritize issue resolution activities. SLO attainment failures are a direct indicator that your IT services are having a negative business impact which is visible to your customers as poor performance and/or unhandled errors. Value realization Once the SLM process is established, you will see a reduction in the effort required to identify business impacting issues, a better ability to communicate with your business stakeholders, and an easier time proving the business’ return on investment in IT services. Your SLM KPIs will provide quantifiable proof of these improvements. In addtion, you should be able to simplify your observability strategy by removing or reducing your dependency on legacy consumption metrics and the logic required to correlate them against your true goal of measuring performance and quality. Once you are firmly on the path to SLM's goals, consider moving to other use cases within the Uptime, Performance, and Reliability value stream, such as Service Level Management, or Reliability Engineering.

      "body": "Overview \"Do I have all the telemetry I need to adequately measure my service?\" The process of onboarding a service for production monitoring tends to start from the end and work its way to the beginning. Typically, a service is instantiated with agent based monitoring and the team responsible for service delivery needs to read the telemetry coming out of the agent like tea leaves. They work their way backward to understand how the service functions by what can be observed. At New Relic, through tens of thousands of observability deployments, we have discovered that the more involved designers, architects, and developers can be in the definition of optimal service delivery measurement, the better. The emergence of the IT aphorism shift left speaks to the need to involve developers more directly in the software lifecycle activities that happen after the development stage is complete. In the case of service observability, we find there is little specific guidance on how developers can meaningfully contribute to production telemetry definitions. This guide is intended to provide practical suggestions for developers to evaluate the state of your telemetry and suggest paths to improve it. Observability programs that closely link developer expectations with the runtime behavior of production systems are much more effective to diagnose and remediate aberrant conditions. The closer developer connection also produces services that are more robust and performant. You’re a good candidate for service characterization if any of the following are true: Your development teams are disconnected from production observability design. Your production monitoring program suffers from a lag between the introduction of new services/capabilities and their coverage with telemetry and alerting. You need to provide additional business context to your instrumentation for diagnosis and business KPI measurement. You employ a highly customized or proprietary software framework. Your service is under active development. Legacy services, and services built from commercial-off-the-shelf platforms tend to be better served with generic instrumentation options. Desired outcome This guide focuses on the metrics derived from your service’s runtime operation (its code execution) as well as external measurements of execution (through synthetic testing). Service instrumentation planning is the approach used to describe a single service runtime through telemetry. Modern monitoring systems provide deep insight into the technical details of service implementation. The power of distributed trace or bytecode instrumentation allows operations teams to quickly collect detailed service telemetry. Unfortunately, operations teams are often not in the best position to evaluate the quality of the telemetry gathered from the instrumentation. This challenge is compounded by the fact that service delivery teams are asked to implement telemetry collection for the first time in live production systems. Exposing inadequately instrumented services to production users for the purposes of refining that instrumentation creates a period that puts customer satisfaction at risk. This burn-in period often becomes difficult to escape as new features are delivered from code bases without a strong linkage between software delivery and observability programs. By having your development staff involved in improving your service instrumentation, you should realize observability benefits in the following ways. Better informed development decisions by: Detecting areas of volatility or unexpected behavior and addressing them. Understanding what dependencies in your code lack redundancy or robustness, and taking measures to refactor the service. Appreciating how end-user cohorts are employing your software. You can better understand where improvements will have the biggest impact. Improved troubleshooting: More precise and contextually relevant telemetry from your service will allow for more accurate and actionable detection of faults. With better telemetry naming, operations staff can use a common language with developers during incidents, reducing the time to triage and remediate incidents. Key performance indicators It is important to identify some simple KPIs that help to gauge the ongoing improvements in your software delivery and operations programs. The following outlines some suggested KPIs to consider as you invest in improved instrumentation. Business KPIs are aligned to your overall program objectives and should be consistently measured to demonstrate ongoing program improvement for each service. Practitioner KPIs are used to measure changes in the execution of job functions for those participating in the development and management of services. Business KPIs Service quality A metric is required to define how well your service is operating. This will depend upon the needs of your organization and the constraints of the services being monitored. Goal: Improved service quality attainment score over time. Best practices: Create a graphical representation as a trend of Service Quality achievement for defined periods (Monthly / Quarterly). Service Apdex can provide an effective Service specific quality score. (See Apdex: Measure user satisfaction.) A well defined Service Level Management (SLM) approach using SLIs that describe the level of expected operation for service boundaries can be a useful way to establish a single measurement of quality. Release frequency The number of releases for a given service. This should indicate the velocity of the software delivery organization. Often release frequency isn’t immediately comparable between development organizations. Instead, weighting high-value releases or features to bugs can provide an improved comparative context. Goal: Consistency of attainment with consistent or improving Service Quality indicator. Best practices: Can be derived from deployment markers or other events sent to New Relic. Measure directly from code or project management tools such as Jira, BitBucket, GitHub. Consider implementing a collection mechanism to capture release events and store them directly in New Relic. See NR1 CICD Innovation for example JIRA and BitBucket configs. Practitioner KPIs Feature release frequency Quantification of the percentage of releases that are directly related to new feature development versus bug fixes or technical debt retirement. The relationship to feature to fix will vary between teams and projects based on the history of the service. Goal: A consistent or improving feature release frequency consistent with the service delivery goals. Best practices: Practitioner feature release frequency is often acquired in the same manner as the broader release frequency business KPI. This metric is then made available to the development team for the service. Mean time to close Average duration of alert-driven incidents in New Relic. See Alert Quality Management Use Case Implementation Guide for more details. Goal: Steady decrease of incident close time for identified services. Best practices: Follow the Alert Quality Management Use Case Implementation Guide, understanding Service behavior through the lens of the alerts defined to help improve service delivery. Prerequisites Before you begin to introduce Service Instrumentation into your development processes, get acquainted with New Relic fundamentals available from New Relic University. In addition to NRU training, review and keep the following documentation resources handy: APM agent install and configuration Instrumentation guides: C-SDK Go Java .NET Node.js PHP Python Ruby OpenTelemetry SDKs Introduction to New Relic synthetic monitoring Establish current state Determine your instrumentation needs Understand endpoint testing Determine your instrumentation needs Instrumentation is the process to acquire telemetry from a software system and its associated services for the purpose of describing that software system's runtime behavior and business function. Monitoring systems tend to provide generic capabilities for telemetry acquisition that can be fine tuned to close gaps when monitoring the function of a software system. This use case assumes that your Observability Program has completed the Quality Foundation OMA use case implementation guide and that you have a well considered and deployed telemetry collection architecture for your services. With the possible exception of alert definition, instrumentation offers the most open-ended and customizable activities related to observability. The New Relic One platform provides features to highly customize your use of instrumentation. Because of this, you should carefully consider the amount of time and effort you’re going to put into instrumenting your services. Like all service instrumentation assets and dependencies, the introduction of instrumentation will require ongoing oversight and maintenance and therefore is a form of technical debt you will accrue for your project. As you begin the process of instrumentation, you want to continually ask yourself the question: Is the visibility I will gain from this instrumentation worth the cost of implementation and support? Decision matrix As a first step you should evaluate the default instrumentation you obtain from your Observability platform and ask yourself the question: Does the telemetry adequately describe the function and the purpose of my service? Think about what your service does. Perhaps it receives an order, needs to validate the order for integrity, conveys that order to a clearinghouse service, and receives a confirmation code that is relayed back to the requestor. This example gives a clear path to break down the function of service and evaluate if we have enough telemetry and context to make informed appraisals of how the service is functioning. Conceptual service that receives and processes http requests. If this conceptual diagram represents the implementation of the service, you need to know at any moment in time: How many requests do I receive? How many messages and HTTP requests do I send? How many requests are successful? What is the response time for a full request? What is the response time for invocation to a dependency? How much resource should this process take under what number of requests? What are all my points of failure? Most monitoring frameworks for application runtimes will gather telemetry like this as basic functionality. However, sometimes specific implementation of your service will pose a challenge to the generic instrumentation assumptions made by the monitoring software. In this case your Observability platform will need to accommodate your needs and provide an ability to modify a default monitoring configuration. The following table documents some additional situations where you would consider adding additional telemetry or metadata capture through instrumentation. The practices section that follows describes how to close those gaps to ensure your observability platform provides telemetry needed to manage your service. Considerations for instrumentation: Are my base telemetry requirements satisfied? If not, document the gaps and evaluate if they can be closed through custom configuration or additional instrumentation techniques. Can I isolate discrete user stories within the telemetry? If not, use trace capabilities of agents to capture the invocation of a discrete user story with adequate context metadata. Do I have insight into the parameters that are invoking user stories? If not, use custom attributes through agent SDKs to add context to the transactions and spans. Can I measure the major functional components of the software? If not, use instrumentation SDKs to create baseline metrics on a specific functional element of the code. (cache lookups, processing routines, or utility functions). Can I measure the client interactions from my code to external systems? If not, ensure requests and responses are encapsulated by component level tracking. If the client invocation is asynchronous, consider implementing distributed trace features to view the successive processing. Understand endpoint testing Endpoint testing is a simple and practical approach that greatly expedites how to determine the root cause of a given system failure. It allows operations and supporting teams to quickly know there is a real problem, and isolate that problem to a specific service. Modern software systems depend on a number of services to complete their tasks. Historically, the process of monitoring those service endpoints was straightforward. The architecture team would produce a well documented map of dependencies for the operations team. The operations team would dutifully create a check of the itemized endpoints. Today, with continuous delivery processes and small batch changes, new endpoints and dependencies can be created and deployed at a rate that makes it difficult for an operations team to anticipate and proactively define synthetic checks. By giving the service developers greater scope of control to define production services tests during the development phase, you will greatly increase the coverage of endpoint tests for your Observability program. Decision matrix To determine whether to create a synthetic check is straightforward. You will want to know the first occurrence of a failure for a dependency. If you answer “yes” to any of the following questions, consider creating a dedicated synthetic check. Is the end point customer facing? Does the endpoint invoke new dependencies? Is the endpoint on a different network infrastructure? Is the endpoint shared between multiple services? Is the endpoint a content origin supported by a CDN? Improvement process Config based instrumentation Isolate service functions Define custom transaction names Measure service components Ensure your frameworks are measured Track every external call Test your endpoints Config based instrumentation Each New Relic agent provides a variety of configuration options. Typically you will define a standard approach to include the agents within infrastructure hosts, application runtimes, and connections to your cloud service providers. Default agent configurations are generic and widely applicable. One of the best ways for developers to influence the applicability of deployment is by overriding the default configuration options for your service instance. The following are default instrumentation options to consider. Create an effective service name Tip New Relic agents provide a variety of mechanisms to define the Service runtime name. Please see the application naming guide to find the implementation details for your runtime environment. The name you give a service provides the namespace (where you will find the agent data). One of the most important strategies New Relic uses to understand the behavior of your services is to aggregate like things together and to use the commonalities derived from aggregation to isolate variance. Modern services are often deployed to multiple contexts to ensure capacity handling or specific functional segmentation. In order to take advantage of the benefits of aggregation, it is very important that your service runtimes are grouping instances with identical operational characteristics. Therefore, when deploying services, pay close attention to the following three criteria to help you name your deployed services: Does my service target a specific audience? Is my service running a different codebase? Is my codebase using a different runtime configuration? If you answer “yes” to any of these questions, consider creating a unique name for your service. Audience criteria Think of the audience as the group of end users or service functions. If your service is split between North American and European deployments, the runtimes in those deployments should be grouped accordingly. For example: newrelic.appname = PORTAL_AMER Copy and newrelic.appname = PORTAL_EMEA Copy This will group the telemetry created by that audience together, allowing you to better understand the contextual similarities of service problems related to a specific user audience. Sometimes the way we deploy applications divides the operational context of a service, such as a portal application with administrative functions. Maybe the admin functions are baked into the general portal codebase, but only one instance in a cluster is handling the portal admin requests. In that case you have a functional audience segmentation opportunity, so you should ensure that it is named appropriately. For example: newrelic.appname = PORTAL_MAIN Copy and newrelic.appname = PORTAL_ADMIN Copy Codebase criteria If you’re running different code versions under the guise of one service, consider segmenting those runtime instances and incorporating version naming as part of your naming scheme. When you group code together as one service name that is executing different service versions, you’re increasing the noise to signal ratio of any metrics you produce. Different code versions might use different amounts of compute resource or process data differently. It becomes very difficult to determine if a service is behaving normally when the signals you get from the metrics are due to different functional implementations. Consider adding a numeric identifier to the service name if you have multiple versions running concurrently. For example: newrelic.appname = PORTAL_MAIN_V112 Copy and newrelic.appname = PORTAL_MAIN_V115 Copy If you employ feature flag framework frameworks like LaunchDarkly or Split, you may have multiple versions of an application or service within a single codebase. Please consult the Isolating Service Functions section to address those conditions. Runtime criteria If an instance of a service is deployed to a system with different runtime constraints, it should be encapsulated in its own telemetry namespace. This can be a deployment to a different datacenter that offers network connectivity advantages to a shared resource, or perhaps the service is running on a separate compute tier with a different memory or thread configuration. These characteristics that affect the code runtime operation can cause different behaviors that lead to different operations behaviors. For example: newrelic.appname = PORTAL_NYC_DC Copy and newrelic.appname = PORTAL_REALLY_BIG_FOOTPRINT Copy Override default agent configuration Tip The New Relic agents provide a variety of options for runtime configuration. Please refer to the agent configuration guide for the options specific to your runtime. Each New Relic APM agent provides a variety of options to modify the default configuration. The most comprehensive and consistent location is the configuration file that accompanies each agent install. However, New Relic agents can also be configured by passing command line parameters directly to the service instance runtime, by using environment variables, or by calling functions within the agent's SDK at runtime. .NET agent configuration options: Using the New Relic .NET SDK API Environment variables Config file options Isolate service functions As the Create an effective service name section indicated, one of the primary objectives of instrumentation is to configure the New Relic agent to group like runtime constraints together as a single named unit. We suggest this because software systems should behave in deterministic ways. For a specific set of inputs, you should get an expected range of measurable outcomes. The degree to which we can comfortably contain these constraints into named service runtime components greatly helps us understand normal behavior and isolate aberrant behavior. Once you have settled on an effective service naming strategy, the next step is to look within the telemetry collected for the service and determine if it suitably isolates the service’s functionality. The implementation pattern we most often encounter is a series of functions being invoked by a web request. The initial receipt and handling of a web request to a service runtime results in the allocation of processing resources. New Relic defines this resource allocation and code execution as a transaction. The New Relic agent is configured with a set of assumptions that create namespaces for transactions as they are detected. Those assumptions differ between the agent language runtime. For example, a good example of how the New Relic Java agent determines the transaction name can be found in the Java agent's transaction naming documentation. However, even after the agent transaction naming protocol has been applied, it may leave you with an unsatisfactory result. By adding additional instrumentation to name the transaction to improve its context, this can greatly improve your understanding of the service’s execution behavior. The goal for transaction naming should be an APM transactions view that provides good segmentation of the services functions in an approach that is easy to understand for a non-developer. New Relic service transaction breakdown view. The transaction breakdown image is a good example of transaction segmentation. It provides detailed tracking of the amount of work being done by each transaction within the broader codebase of the service. It also displays the transaction with a plain user-friendly name that offers some hint of its business context (what the transaction does). As you learn more about naming transactions and including attributes, be sure to make your naming approach accessible for non-technical observers of the data. Transaction breakdown: the transactions in this service seem to be highly weighted to one transaction name with a pretty generic name. Breakdowns like this beg the question: \"Is this a good representation of the work my service does?\" The obtuse transaction breakdown image demonstrates a bad example of transaction name segmentation. In this case we have about 60% of the transaction volume being named OperationHandler/handle. Both the percentage attribution of the transaction volume and the generic nature of the name indicate there might be an overly zealous aggregation of transactions underneath that transaction namespace. A good way to validate your transaction naming approach is to review the distribution of response times for your transaction over a significant period of time in the service web transaction histogram dashboard. The service transaction histogram view shows the count of transactions that fall into each response time bucket. A good naming strategy tends to display a normal distribution. The service transaction image shows a wide range of transaction response rates. Although the bulk of the transactions land in the 0-200 millisecond range, it indicates values ranging from 200-1000 milliseconds. When you have a highly distributed range of responses for a transaction, you should ask yourself: What information do I have during the transaction execution that can help me name this transaction? In many cases, non-normal distributions are a direct result of the parameters being passed to a request, or the work the transaction is being asked to do. It is pretty easy to consider that a service query transaction might take a data range as a parameter. The date range when small might provide a faster lookup time. Therefore, perhaps providing a meaning scheme that is derived from some expected parameter constraints (> 1day, 1-5 days, >5 days) might provide a more meaningful segmentation. Your objective is to create a transaction name that facilitates grouping transactions with the fewest unique characteristics. A more normal distribution of transaction segmentation where individual transactions report more consistent response time attainment with fewer exceptions. The normal distribution image demonstrates more purposefully named transactions within a service. In this case the web transaction response times are more closely grouped, indicating consistent execution characteristics. By ensuring your transaction naming strategy provides a consistent mechanism to group your service’s functions by the types of operations they are performing, you will be able to quickly isolate aberrant behavior, or better understand the root cause of the variations. This will allow you to refactor your application and increase the overall predictability of your service’s functions. Define custom transaction names Tip Consult the New Relic agent API guide for your language agent to review the transaction naming procedure for your runtime. The New Relic agent transaction naming service requires the invocation of a SetName(String name) like API call to the New Relic agent SDK. Each language runtime agent has its own syntax and option for setting the name. For example, to take the value of an http request parameter and use it to name a transaction in the New Relic Java agent, you can use code similar to this: com.newrelic.agent.Agent.LOG.finer(\"[my query handler] Renaming transaction based on an important query parameter\"); com.newrelic.api.agent.NewRelic.setTransactionName(\"Query Handler_\" + (javax.servlet.http.HttpServletRequest)_servletrequest_0).getParameter(\"important_query_parm\")); Copy Please note: There is a maximum capacity to transaction names within New Relic. Your transaction naming strategy will have to trade off a degree of specificity if there are thousands of potential transaction names. When too many transaction names are being reported, New Relic will attempt to create rules to group those transaction names. More details can be found in the agent troubleshooting guide related to metric grouping issues. Should you suspect a metric grouping issue, open a support case with New Relic, and we will be happy to work with you to isolate the cause of the transaction naming issue. Capture parameters with your transactions Tip Consult the New Relic agent custom attributes guide for your agent language to review the metadata enhancement options for attribute customization. The transaction name is a powerful way for you to segment your Service’s functionality so that you can better understand its behavior. This allows you to discretely isolate functionality directly in the New Relic UI. However, there are many occasions when you will want to get some additional context on the function of your Service without resorting to isolating the transaction name. This can be accomplished by introducing attribute capture by your Service. You can add name:value pair attributes to decorate the details of each transaction. The attributes will be available in each transaction event through the APM transaction trace and errors UI, or through direct query of parameters from the NRDB transaction event type. After you select a transaction trace, you can view the custom attributes you have set for your Service’s transaction. Here is an example of the transaction trace details you can see in the APM errors UI. Custom attributes displayed in the APM errors UI. If you have developed a useful transaction name segmentation, you can use the additional context of the attributes to better understand the inputs, cohorts, or segments that led to an unexpected result. In addition to being able to understand the context of your transaction within the APM UI, the introduction of parameters is an extremely useful tool to aggregate and analyze transactions by querying transaction data directly. Custom attributes are added to each transaction, making it easy to isolate and facet on specific conditions. NRQL query expression that uses a custom attribute to facet database call duration. The parameter capture approach can also be used with feature flag systems like Split or LaunchDarkly. In this case, as you are implementing the decision handler for the feature flag, consider capturing the flag context (for example, optimized_version = on) that is being applied to the block of code controlling the version or feature the customer sees. NRQL query that demonstrates the result when the state of a feature flag is captured by a transaction custom attribute. The feature flag state attribute allows us to understand the impact of the code execution path on performance, throughput, and dependency utilization. For example, to take the value of an http request parameter and save it as a custom attribute in the New Relic Java agent, you can use code similar to this: com.newrelic.agent.Agent.LOG.finer(\"[my query handler] Adding an Attribute to transaction based on an important query parameter\"); com.newrelic.api.agent.NewRelic.addCustomParameter(\"ImportantParm\", (javax.servlet.http.HttpServletRequest)_servletrequest_0).getParameter(\"important_query_parm\")); Copy Measure service components The behavior of a specific transaction within the context of a service is a powerful way to segregate functionality and ensure a software system is operating effectively. However, another way to look at the behavior of a software system is to review the detailed component execution model of its implementation. The application framework code components are shared throughout the service, and the ongoing evaluation of component performance can provide an insight into the overall service health. Within New Relic One there are two places we can observe component execution details. The service summary dashboard in APM provides a view of the composite execution of the service broken down by its component parts (for example, garbage collection execution or database calls). This summary dashboard provides a breakdown of major component types within the application. Memcached, External Web Invocations, MySQL and Dirac are all examples of shared code frameworks that the collective transactions of the Service are using to execute their business logic. A similar breakdown is provided on a transaction by transaction basis. This single transaction summary view breaks out the contributing execution time by component. This helps you see the aggregate performance of components within a transaction. Transaction component segments will tend to demonstrate consistent performance behavior, you can use this consistency to detect a change in its fundamental behavior. This can be a good indication of an underlying issue. Resource constraints tend to manifest more obviously within component frameworks than within individual transaction details. This allows you to infer characteristics of dependencies through the common constraints being experienced by all code running within a service. Ensure your frameworks are measured Tip Consult the New Relic agent instrumentation and SDK guides under the language agent for your service runtime to find information about adding metric names to your instrumentation. The syntax for framework instrumentation is specific to the language your service is written in, but the general approach is consistent for all. Consider the threads of execution within your Services as an analogy for transactions within New Relic telemetry. Each method or function execution on the stack is an opportunity to add additional instrumentation. In this way New Relic maintains a time-annotated invocation stack for the transaction and uses those method/function start/stop timings to aggregate it into a series of component metrics. A simple Node.js application making a call to a MongoDB. The two major components of the application are the receipt of the request and get/put operations to the MongoDB. If a particular segment of logic is crucial to the function of your Service or transaction, consider wrapping that call with callbacks to the New Relic agent so that the agent can understand that it has entered a discrete code component and can aggregate the time consumed within that component accordingly. By passing a metric name to the callback, you will create a component segment metric for your service and transaction. The metric naming option is specific to the instrumentation language, so be sure to consult the specific language documentation. The New Relic agents allow you to specify a custom metric name for the instrumentation. The metricName will be used to determine the aggregated metric for the component. The following example demonstrates the metricName parameter being passed to a Java agent SDK @Trace annotation. @Weave public abstract class MQOutboundMessageContext implements OutboundTransportMessageContext { @Trace(dispatcher = true, metricName=\"MQTransport\") public void send(final TransportSendListener listener) throws TransportException { try { NewRelic.getAgent().getTracedMethod().setMetricName(\"Message\", \"MQ\", \"Produce\"); MQHelper.processSendMessage(this, NewRelic.getAgent().getTracedMethod()); } catch (Exception e) { NewRelic.getAgent().getLogger().log(Level.FINE, e, \"Unable to set metadata on outgoing MQ message\"); } Weaver.callOriginal(); } } Copy Track every external service call Tip Consult the New Relic agent instrumentation and SDK guides under the language agent for your service runtime to find the details of client library instrumentation. Client instrumentation refers to encapsulating a call from your service to an external resource. Generally, New Relic agents are aware of clients popular for HTTP, gRPC, messaging, and database protocols and will apply the appropriate instrumentation pattern to aggregate calls to those clients as external services. External service dashboard details within New Relic APM. If you have written your own client handler for a protocol, or are using something very new or somewhat niche, the New Relic agent may not recognize the client and record the behavior of the client call. To this end you should verify the external services and databases within APM to represent all expected externalities for your service. Database protocol dashboard details within New Relic APM. It is important to validate that all your services' dependencies are represented here. If you do not see your service dependencies, you will need to introduce new instrumentation to intercept the external call so that your APM agent can track it accordingly. The following example demonstrates wrapping an external call in Golang for capture by the agent. package main import ( \"net/http\" \"github.com/newrelic/go-agent/v3/newrelic\" ) func currentTransaction() *newrelic.Transaction { return nil } func main() { txn := currentTransaction() client := &http.Client{} request, _ := http.NewRequest(\"GET\", \"http://www.example.com\", nil) segment := newrelic.StartExternalSegment(txn, request) response, _ := client.Do(request) segment.Response = response segment.End() } Copy Examples of other agent API external call tracing: Go ExternalSegment Java ExternalParameters Python external_trace Test your endpoints Endpoint testing provides two benefits to your Service Instrumentation program. Defect detection: By encoding a test for an endpoint that produces a simple true/false result, it allows the operations team to isolate discrete failures to determine if the integrity of service delivery has been compromised. Baselining: Synthetic or machine tests provide a predictable set of conditions that allow you to evaluate the consistency of your service delivery from a control perspective. New Relic’s synthetic monitoring offers the ability to create a variety of testing types by employing an enhanced Selenium JavaScript SDK. Once a Selenium-based test script has been defined, New Relic will manage the location of the script execution as well as its frequency. New Relic synthetics launch dashboard. The synthetic test offers a variety of test options, each with its own focus. For more information see our synthetic monitoring documentation. From the perspective of a Service developer, the monitor type that is most frequently employed is Endpoint availability. This monitor type provides the ability to script http request conditions. These can be as simple as a POST or GET to an accessible API, or involve multiple steps where the Selenium monitoring script successively evaluates requests to ascertain functional integrity of a multi-step process. In practice, developers should consider implementing the simplest possible test to evaluate endpoint availability and integrity. For example, you have just created a new Service endpoint that provides the current exchange rate for a group of currencies. This is a simple GET at an endpoint that returns a JSON object array. Request example: http://example-ip:3000/exchange Response example: [ { \"status\": [ \"quote\" ], \"_id\": \"5b9bf97f61c22f4fb5beb5c9\", \"name\": \"cdn\", \"Created_date\": \"2021-07-12T18:10:07.488Z\", \"__v\": 1 }, { \"status\": [ \"quote\" ], \"_id\": \"5b9bfb2a61c22f4fb5beb5ca\", \"name\": \"usd\", \"Created_date\": \"2021-07-12T18:17:14.224Z\", \"__v\": 0.80 }, { \"status\": [ \"quote\" ], \"_id\": \"5b9bfb3261c22f4fb5beb5cb\", \"name\": \"eur\", \"Created_date\": \"2021-07-12T18:17:22.476Z\", \"__v\": 0.68 }, { \"status\": [ \"quote\" ], \"_id\": \"5b9bfb3761c22f4fb5beb5cc\", \"name\": \"mex\", \"Created_date\": \"2021-07-12T18:17:27.009Z\", \"__v\": 15.97 } ] Copy In order for this service to be considered operational, it needs to respond to requests but also provide the four currency responses. We’re not worried about the content at the moment, just the fact we get four elements back in the array one, for each CDN, USD, EUR and MEX currencies. Using New Relic synthetic monitoring, an API test script could look like the following: /** * This script checks to see if we get the currency data from the endpoint. */ var assert = require('assert'); var myQueryKey = 'secret_key'; var options = { uri: 'http://example_ip:3000/exchange', headers: { 'X-Query-Key': myQueryKey, 'Accept': 'application/json' } }; function callback (err, response, body){ var data = JSON.parse(body); var info = body; if (Array.isArray(data)) { if (data.length !== 4) { assert.fail('Unexpected results in API Call, result was ' + JSON.stringify(data)); } } } $http.get(options, callback); Copy The synthetics script can be directly configured in the New Relic interface, but we highly recommend you maintain your endpoint tests within your source repository system and employ automation. This will help ensure your endpoint testing accompanies the new endpoint dependencies that your Services introduce to production service delivery. Value realization The impact of Service Instrumentation will be directly related to the level of attention you’re willing to invest in overseeing the process. Like the process of monitoring services, your Observability program will benefit through a dedicated team function that thinks critically about its expectations of return for its investment in effort. Here is some guidance to think about the cost of investment for your organization and expectation of benefit. The following section outlines an approach for estimating the investments and returns you should expect by incorporating Service Instrumentation into your Observability practice. Investments Training Ensure all developers are familiar with New Relic agent SDKs and platform capabilities. Cost Model: Dependent on your company's developer FTE model and project estimation. Estimation: Typically a number of hours for a developer to become effective using New Relic instrumentation features. Initial: 16 HRS Training / Exploration Recurring: 4 HRS/Q Review Per developer a yearly investment of 16-40 hours training to develop core skills and maintain skills currency for New Relic platform Development and maintenance The development effort required to implement and maintain instrumentation within a Service project. Cost Model: Dependent on your company's developer FTE model and project estimation. Estimation: This tends to be dependent on the scope of the project and the amount of instrumentation work required. Initial: 8 HRS per developer per service Recurring: 4 HRS/Q Maintenance Per developer a project estimation of 16-32 hours developing and maintaining Service instrumentation Returns AQM impact Alert Quality Management delivers significant benefit to the operations team by ensuring the alert notifications from variant system performance are dealt with swiftly. This improves service delivery and resource allocation during incident remediation. An effective instrumentation practice federated into your observability program will greatly improve your team’s ability to create meaningful alerts. KPIs: Volume: Incident Count Volume: Accumulated Incident Duration Volume: Mean-Time-To-Close (MTTC) User Engagement: Mean Time to Investigate Outcomes: Less alert noise Greater alert and incident responsiveness Less unknown root cause Increased operations productivity Improved service delivery Service quality improvement Improving your service quality will have a direct impact on the key financial metrics for your Service. This will require that you have a well rationalized financial model for your application. Typically this return can be projected by associating a currency value for each percent improvement on a core service quality measure like errors or apdex attainment. As your investment in Service Instrumentation increases, you should see improved attainment on your service quality measures. KPIs: Service Quality (Business KPI) Outcomes: Decreased number of user impacting errors More performant and resilient Service components Service delivery improvement By providing better telemetry from your Service instances, your delivery organization should be able to more quickly detect volatility or downtime and remediate faster. This will lead to better overall service delivery KPIs and decrease episodes of outage or degradation. Cost can be associated with the amount of time it takes to detect, investigate and remediate an incident. This might be related to the value the Service provides your organization that will be lost during an event, or may be related to the general cost to deal with the poorly behaving Service. KPIs: Mean time to detect (MTTD) Mean time to identify (MTTI) Mean time to resolve (MTTR) Outcomes: Decreased time to detect incidents Decreased time to resolve incidents",

Then replace the template information with your own text, lists, and tables as needed. Before you create sections, start your doc with a brief introduction, usually no more than a paragraph, that helps readers understand what your doc will cover. Your introduction (and the structure of your doc) should help readers understand within ten seconds whether they are in the right place. Section example Begin each section with a meaningful H2 title. The docs site uses these to generate the contents, which appears automatically in the left navigation. If you want to include a screenshot with the section, provide a permalink for the Docs team to create the image for you. Due to security requirements, the Docs team manages all images on the docs site. Code example def article_url(category, article, options={}) url_for(options.reverse_merge( :controller => 'articles';, :action => 'show', :category => category, :article => article )) end Copy List example For multi-step, actionable procedures, use ordered lists (ol in HTML or numbers in Markdown). For example: Add require('newrelic'); as the first line of your app's main module. Use the command npm install newrelic --save for each application you want to monitor. For unordered lists, use bullets (ul in HTML or * in Markdown). For example: Black White For complex lists, consider using collapsers. Table example Tables help organize detailed lists so the information is easier to skim. Tables are easier to manage in HTML. For exammple: <table> <thead> <tr> <th width={200}> **Item** </th> <th> **Requirements** </th> </tr> </thead> <tbody> <tr> <td> Some thing </td> <td> More detailed information about it </td> </tr> <tr> <td> Another thing </td> <td> More detailed information about another thing </td> </tr> </tbody> </table> Copy Tables created in Markdown use three or more hyphens --- to create each column’s header, and pipes | to separate each column. For example: | Item | Requirements ------------ | ------------ | Some thing | More detailed information about it | Another thing | More detailed information about another thing Copy",

      "body": "We use the data dictionary to provide information about data types (for example, Transaction, Metric, Log) and attached attributes. This is exposed in the New Relic query experience, on hovering over the data types and attributes. And we also expose the dictionary to the public. This doc contains info on how to add data to the dictionary. Note that currently we don't have infrastructure integration data in the dictionary. We also have very few attributes for the Metric data type, just a few basic default ones, despite there being many potential attributes attached to that data type depending on what the data source is. Data dictionary structure The data in the data dictionary is structured like this: Data types: sometimes called \"events\" for historical reasons, these are the NRDB data objects, like Transaction, Metric, Log, Span, etc. Attributes: these are key:value pairs attached to data types. One attribute can have multiple data types listed for it. For example, appName is on multiple data types. Data source: The New Relic product from which the data originates. With the current implementation, a data type must have a single data source assigned. This isn't ideal, as theoretically a data type can come from multiple sources. Add a new data type To add a new data type: Make a new folder in this directory, alongside the other directories: src/data-dictionary/events Copy Duplicate a data type file (for example, this Metric data type), place it in the new folder, and fill it out with the new info. For how to add attributes on a new data type, keep reading. Add attributes To add attributes: Check if there's an existing attribute that has the same name and same general definition as the one you're trying to add. If it exists, edit that file to include the new data type (under events:). If an existing attribute is fairly close in definition but not exact, try to edit the definition so it works for all associated data types. If there is no existing attribute, create a new one. The easiest way is to copy an existing attribute file, edit all relevant fields to be accurate, and place it in the folder of the data type it's attached to (for example, Transaction). When writing an attribute, try to keep it as concise as possible, and avoid using links. For more on that, see Style. If the attribute has one of the units of measurement we use (like units: percentage (%)), add that to the front matter. For info on units, see Units. Attribute style guidelines When adding or editing attributes, some things to keep in mind: Aim for concise descriptions. Notes on this: Feel free to use sentence fragments. Feel free to edit definitions submitted from internal teams as sometimes their definitions will be overly long or have unneeded links. Some attributes are only present in some situations (for example, when a specific APM agent is used, or when a specific config option is true). We should avoid documenting most of these, with the idea that most customers will only care about the data because it's being reported for them, and won't care about the things that factor into the reasons why it wouldn't be reported. If it's thought that the addition would help customers who already have the data reporting understand the data better, you can include it. Write so it reads well as plain text. Details on this: Note that the docs site data dictionary has our usual docs styles available, but the query UI definitions have no styling available. This means that you should write definitions so that they are understandable without any styling, as plain text. You can often avoid any need for styling (for example, data types like Transaction are easy to understand as plain text, as are most phrasings that use attribute names or values. When plain text makes something too ambiguous and you need some styling, use back ticks to indicate attributes or values (for example, a definition like: Reported when ` category ` is ` http ` ). Using this also sets us up for success if we implement styling in the UI definitions in the future. We should avoid links because those aren't visible in the query UI; the query UI only displays plain text. However, every attribute entry in the query UI does display a 'See attribute in docs' link that links to the complete and normally formatted docs site entry. This means that we can use links provided that they will display in an easy to understand way in the query UI. For example, here's an example of an attribute that would read clearly in plain text despite not having a link. We should avoid using a link format like \"For more information, see Create an alert condition\", because it wouldn't read well in plain text, and would choose something like \"For more information, see our alert condition docs.\" Using units of measurement Attribute entries have an optional unit of measurement field in the front matter. For example, here the front matter for an attribute with a percent unit of measurement: --- name: cpuPercent type: attribute units: percentage (%) events: - ProcessSample --- Copy What unit of measurement to select for an attribute is sometimes obvious, like if the attribute value is measured in milliseconds (units: milliseconds (ms)) or seconds (units: seconds (s)) or a percentage (units: percentage (%)). We also have several units of measurement that are not obvious, like count, enum, rate, and ID. (Technically, these aren't actually \"units of measurement\" and are more just conceptual data types but we're doing it this way as a workaround so you can ignore the fact that units of measurement isn't actually accurate.) The main reason we want to specify this information is that this will control what kinds of queries or charts can be created or auto-suggested by New Relic. For example, the New Relic UI wouldn't want to auto-suggest a chart graphing the average of ID values because that wouldn't make any sense. So attributes with accurate units, such as data types, will help product provide more practical help/suggestions to customers in future. Here are some tips for the non-obvious unit types: count: This is a count of something, though not a count of time-based units. For a number to be a count, it must (a) only be capable of increasing during a given time/sampling period, and (b) have a theoretically uncapped range. This wouldn't be used for a count of time units; if it was a count of seconds, for example, you would just use 'seconds' as the unit of measurement. A couple of examples of a count: databaseCallCount threadConcurrency enum: enum is short for enumerated list. In other words, it is a specific range of numbers that represent other non-numeric elements. For example, an attribute that had HTTP error codes (404, 505, etc.) as possible values would be an enum. A range of numbers that represent color codes would be another example of an enum. (Theoretically, an enum can represent lists without numeric values but we have no need to categorize strings so we only care about numeric-value lists.) Example: httpResponsecode. rate: Use this for any rate (for example, count per second). These are typically for averaged rates over small units of time, like second or millisecond. We previously have used the unit of time for these attributes (for example, using seconds as the unit of measurement for a count per second rate), but now we want to use rate for these. This is necessary because the types of displays used for rates would be different than the types of displays used for a simpler duration/count measurement. Example: MySQL integration attribute db.innodb.dataReadBytesPerSecond, which has the definition \"Rate at which data is read from InnoDB tables in bytes per second.\" id: Use ID for any identification number attribute. Example: appId.",

When you edit a file, tech writers on our team review it for style, grammar, and formatting. That said, if you're curious about our style guidelines, you're welcome (but not obligated) to take a look. Edit a doc If you see a minor problem in our documentation that you want to quickly fix, you can use GitHub to edit the file and submit your pull request. A member of the Docs team will review your edit and publish your changes. We'll follow up with you if we have any questions. To edit existing content without building the site locally: On the docs site, navigate to the doc you'd like to edit. Click Edit page on the top corner of the right nav. A GitHub page will open with the source of the doc. Click the pencil icon in the top right. Make your edits (don't worry too much about formatting or grammar, we're happy to take care of that). At the bottom of the page, enter a commit message that describes your change, then click Commit changes. Follow the prompts to submit your pull request. A member of the Docs team will review your pull request and comment with any feedback. Once we've merged your pull request into the Develop branch, your changes will go live with our next deploy (usually within a few hours). If you'd like to go deeper with development, see our Contributors guide for information on how to fork our site, build it locally, and submit pull requests. Clone (copy) an existing doc Once you've cloned the docs-website repository, use your text editor to copy an existing doc. Rename and edit the copy and then save it as a new doc. Your cloned doc automatically inherits the original doc's frontmatter content. Make sure to change that, too. If you want your cloned doc to be translated, follow standard procedures to request translation. Create new docs You can use article templates or clone an existing doc as a template. To create a new doc: Clone the repo on your computer. In /src/content/docs/, find a good location for your doc. Using your text editor, create a new .mdx file or copy an existing doc. Write your content. Optional: Add your doc to the right nav .yml file. The navigation files can be a bit hard to work with, so feel free to leave this step for a Docs writer to handle when they review your pull request. Commit your changes and create a pull request. The Tech Docs team has two heroes watching for new pull requests. We'll help you get the content finalized and make sure that it's in the right place. For bigger projects If you're making larger changes like adding a whole new doc or editing many existing docs, it can be helpful to run the site locally. For instructions, see Tech writer workflow. Delete pages If you are comfortable with deleting the page yourself, go for it. Note that if a doc is marked for translation, we should also delete it in the i18n folder. To request us to delete something: File an issue in the docs-website repo, or contact the @hero in the #documentation channel if you're a New Relic employee. We'll take a look at your issue and help out. Private edits If you need to stage content for a private beta or limited release, contact the docs hero in the #documentation Slack channel. Request a future publication date (for New Relic employees) If your draft needs to be released on a specific date or within a specific timeframe (for example, right before a release), contact the Tech Docs @hero in the #documentation Slack channel.

For brief instructions for common use cases, see Procedures, but if you're doing larger docs site projects, it's recommended you understand the general concepts beforehand. Terms When talking about the docs site structure, sometimes people use different words for the same things. Below is a list of terms that can help us communicate about the docs site structure: Doc files: All the docs are represented by .mdx files, also known as markdown files. Nav files: The nav files are what govern the displayed structure of the docs site, as exposed in the docs site left sidebar. The nav files are yaml files located in the nav directory. Folder: In this context, \"folders\" refers to the actual docs site folder structure (those folders and files in the content directory). Referring to \"folders\" can be a helpful way to differentiate between the actual folder structure and the displayed structure that's set using the nav files. Sidebar: On public-facing docs, the sidebar is what is visible on the left hand side, showing the structure of that category of docs. The sidebar structure is determined by the structure set in the nav file. Category or sub-category: we use these words fairly interchangeably to refer to specific areas of the docs site. For example, we might refer to the \"Accounts\" category, or the \"Manage data\" category. Auto-index pages (deprecated): This refers to a previous implementation where users could load views of the docs in a specific category (for example, by clicking a category heading in the sidebar). We no longer support this implementation. Understand how the docs site structure works This section will explain some of the logic behind how the docs site structure is determined and how the structure we display to the public relates to the actual folder structure. How is the displayed structure related to the actual folders? The actual docs folder structure (the folders and mdx files in the content folder) is entirely separate from the docs site structure in the sidebar. The displayed structure seen in the sidebar is determined solely by the nav files (the yaml-format files in the nav folder). It's important to understand the above point. The divergence of the docs folder structure and the displayed docs site structure is necessary: we need a way to control the structure displayed in the sidebar without requiring us to keep the folder structure and folder names and doc file names completely equivalent. Because these two things are separate, this can mean that there can be some unintuitive aspects of how that logic works. We do have procedures for common use cases, but it will help you a lot to understand the specifics below of how the displayed structure is generated. What determines a doc's URL? Where a doc file (mdx file) is located in the content folder, and the associated folder and file names, are the only factors that govern that doc's URL. For example, consider the following doc file automated-user-provisioning-single-sign.mdx: This doc's URL is solely based on its folder location and the names of the folders. In this case, its URL is: docs.newrelic.com/docs/accounts/accounts/automated-user-management/automated-user-provisioning-single-sign Copy This has important implications, including: When you move a doc from one folder to another, its URL changes. This means that when you move a doc file, you must add a redirect to that doc of its original URL. If you rename an mdx file name or a folder name, that changes its URL. This means you must add a redirect to that doc of its original URL. What does a nav file do? The nav files are quite simple. A nav file controls the displayed structure of docs you see in the sidebar. Currently there are multiple nav files, one for each major section of docs. For example, there's a nav file for \"Accounts\", which contains organization- and account-related settings. And there's a nav file for \"Infrastructure monitoring.\" For more on nav file format, see Nav file format What governs how a sidebar displays? As stated above, the sidebar is just one way that the docs site structure (which is governed by the nav files) is exposed. When a doc is loaded, the docs site searches for that URL across all the nav files. If it finds a match, it displays that nav file in the sidebar with that doc highlighted. A doc's URL may exist in more than one nav file. Currently, it's a rule that a doc can only be located in one place across all nav files. But we still have some docs that exist in multiple nav files. For those cases, our site attempts to find the appropriate nav file by choosing the nav file that matches the top level category in the doc URL. For example, if a doc with the relative URL /docs/accounts/accounts-billing/account-setup/create-your-new-relic-account was in two nav files, the docs site code would search to see if one of the nav files has docs/accounts as its first path field. If it finds a match, it uses that nav file. Nav file format Below is a snippet of the agents.yml nav file. Note that the file has indentation that corresponds to the level of the navigation hierarchy. When making changes or creating a new nav file, be sure to use the existing spacing format. yml title: Agents path: /docs/agents pages: - title: Manage APM agents pages: - title: Agent data pages: - title: Real time streaming path: /docs/agents/manage-apm-agents/agent-data/real-time-streaming - title: Custom instrumentation path: /docs/agents/manage-apm-agents/agent-data/custom-instrumentation - title: Agent attributes path: /docs/agents/manage-apm-agents/agent-data/agent-attributes - title: Custom events path: /docs/agents/manage-apm-agents/agent-data/collect-custom-events - title: Custom metrics path: /docs/agents/manage-apm-agents/agent-data/collect-custom-metrics - title: Manage errors path: /docs/agents/manage-apm-agents/agent-data/manage-errors-apm-collect-ignore-or-mark-expected - title: Link Kubernetes path: /docs/agents/manage-apm-agents/agent-data/link-your-applications-kubernetes - title: App naming pages: - title: Name your application path: /docs/agents/manage-apm-agents/app-naming/name-your-application - title: Use multiple names for an app path: /docs/agents/manage-apm-agents/app-naming/use-multiple-names-app Copy Tip Navigation nesting is currently limited to a maximum of six levels deep. Please reach out to the engineering team if that is not enough. Here are important elements of the nav file: Key Required? Description title yes The text shown in the navigation, either of a doc or a category. path yes The URL path to the doc. Each nav file's top level title also has a path. Do not use trailing slashes. rootNav no rootNav controls whether a nav file will be displayed or hidden on the docs site home page. It is enabled by default. If you want to hide a category from the home page (as we do for our style guide docs, for example), you would set this to false, as shown below: title: Style guide path: /docs/style-guide Copy children no This is hardly ever used. It indicates a sub-navigation node. Procedures Below are instructions for several common procedures. If you're doing a larger docs project, we recommend familiarizing yourself with the general docs site structure concepts. Procedures include: Overview of what a large docs site restructuring involves Add a new docs category Add a doc to sidebar/nav-file Move docs between folders or categories Move or delete folders Create dummy docs Overview of steps for a large docs site restructure project For some smaller docs site edits, you can sometimes simply edit the nav files and not have to touch the doc files or folders. But for larger projects, you may want to or need to edit and move the docs files and folders themselves. Below is a broad overview of the chunks of work such larger projects generally entail. Plan out what the new nav file structure will look like, and plan out the work of moving docs files or creating new folders. It can help to write down the chunks of work a large project will entail. Move the affected doc files to their new folder locations, making sure to add redirects. For more on that, see Move docs between folders. Delete any empty folders. For any folder or file edits you do to the file structure itself (including file or folder renaming, moving files and folders, but not including editing of content or front matter within a doc or nav file), do the same edits to the folders and files in the i18n directory. Not all folders or files will be present in the i18n directory: it only populates an mdx file or an associated folder if that mdx file has been marked for translation. Edit the nav files to reflect the new desired structure and point to the new doc URLs. For more specific and granular procedures, keep reading. Add a new category of docs We'll explain two procedures: adding a sub-category of docs in an existing nav file, and adding an entirely new nav file: Add a new category to a nav file To add a new category to a nav file: In an existing nav file, add a new category, represented by its title. Add the docs you want in that section, emulating the format and indenting of other nav files. To learn more about how this works, see: How a doc's sidebar is determined How a doc category view is determined Add a new nav file Adding an entirely new nav file should be rare and something we only do occasionally during large overhauls of site structure. Adding new nav files should get sign-off from a docs site manager. To add an entirely new nav file: Copy an existing file nav file, or create a new nav file. Customize the new nav file with the categories and docs you want, using the standard nav file formatting and indenting. For more on structure, see nav format. Add a doc to sidebar/nav-file Once you create a doc, you need to place it in a nav file. Do not place a doc in more than one nav file location: if you require a link to a doc from a different category, attempt to place that reference within a relevant doc section. To add a doc to a nav file: In the nav file location where you want to locate it, add the title (its short title displayed in the sidebar and category views) and the path, which is the doc's URL. Ensure that you've emulated the standard nav file formatting and indenting. Move docs to other categories Because the nav file and the actual folder structure aren't connected, there are two different ways to \"move docs\": Move a doc in the nav files: preferred and most common procedure. Move a doc between folders: less frequent, mainly when doing larger projects where we want to do a significant overhaul of the docs structure and want to ensure the folder structure doesn't become too divergent from the nav file structure. Move docs using nav file Move a doc in the nav file when you want to change where it's visible in the sidebar menus. To move a doc from one place to another in the nav file: In the first nav file, copy the two rows representing that doc's entry (the title and path lines) and paste that content into the place you want it to live in the new nav file. In the new nav file section, make sure the formatting and indenting match standard nav file structure. See Nav format for more about nav file structure. Move a doc between folders Note that moving docs between the folders should be relatively rare. The main reasons to do this are when the folder structure and nav file structure are becoming quite divergent, which can be bad for a couple reasons: Too much divergence can create user confusion (for example, when the elements of the folder-based URL are very different than the nav-file-based location) or sub-optimal search engine results. Too much divergence can make it harder for us to find and edit docs, so there can be value to keeping things fairly up to date and parallel. When you move a doc between folders or rename a doc, that changes its URL (for more on why, see Understand structure). Similarly, if you rename a folder, that changes the URL of all docs in that area. To move a doc between folders: Get the current URL of the doc you want to move and add that URL to its own list of redirects. Tips: One way to do this in VSCode is to right click the file name and click \"Get relative path\". If you are moving many files, ask the team about our scripts for programmatically adding redirects to an entire doc directory. Be sure that redirect URLs don't have a trailing slash. Move the doc to its new folder location. If that mdx file is present in the i18n directory (which it will be if it's marked for translation), make an equivalent move of that file in the i18n directory. Update nav files with the new URL. Having the correct doc URL in the nav file, and not a redirect, is important. Note that a doc's URL may be in more than one nav file so searching the site for that URL can help. Move or delete or rename a folder Sometimes when we are doing a larger restructuring project, we may want to move or delete or rename the actual folders instead of simply editing the nav files. Instructions for this: Because moving a folder or changing its name results in changing all the URLs of docs in that folder, you must first add redirects to the affected docs. You can do this manually (described in step #1 here) or you can use a script the docs team has for bulk-adding redirects to all the docs in a directory. Make the desired edit. For example, move the folder to the new location (dragging and dropping in the Finder window, for example), and/or rename the folder. If the edited folder is present in the i18n directory (which it will be if a doc in that folder has been marked for translation), make an equivalent edit of that folder and its files in the i18n directory. Note: the i18n work is only necessary for movements or renaming of folders or files, not for editing of docs or nav file content. For deleting folders, you'll want to essentially follow the same steps as above: adding redirects for the mdx files being moved or deleted, then moving or deleting the docs, and then deleting the empty folders. Change a doc's file name Changing an mdx file's name results in its URL changing. Note that you can change a doc's displayed title in its front matter without changing the actual file name. Changing the file name can be useful. Instructions: Add a redirect to the doc whose file name you're changing. Change the file's name. If that file is present in the i18n directory (which it will be if that doc has been marked for translation), make an equivalent edit of that file's name in the i18n directory. Note: the i18n work is only necessary for movements or renaming of folders or files, not for editing of docs or nav file content. Create \"dummy\" docs We no longer want to have docs in multiple places in the nav files (although we still do have some docs that are like this). If you want a doc to be referenced in more than one location in the nav files, instead attempt to find a place within a doc where it makes sense to reference that doc.",

      "body": "These are some organization basics. Organize your page to make it easier to read Consider these organization guidelines when thinking about the order of information in a doc. By following these guidelines, you'll make it easier for readers to skim and find what they need. How to organize information Comments Separate what and why from how. Define any necessary prerequisites, policies, or background information (the what and the why) before you step through the how (step-by-step procedures). Examples: Explain what the feature is and why it matters before telling readers how to use it. Describe any limitations with user permissions or subscription levels that would prevent them from using the feature. If the feature is available for any user or subscription level, don't bother to say so. Provide a roadmap for what users will be able to accomplish, so they know before starting a procedure that they have everything they need. Front-load directions with context. Make sure readers know where they need to be, before telling them what to do. In general, use (select an app) to describe what users select from the product index. Examples: Go to one.newrelic.com > Explorer > (select an app or service). Select (account dropdown) > User preferences. On the command line, type gitk. Also, structure steps by front-loading context from the user's point of view. For example, instead of \"Go to x to do y,\" structure the step as \"To do y, go to x.\" Separate requirements from options. Example: Type the Email you use to sign in and to receive information from New Relic. Optional: Type additional user emails, separated by commas. Follow the \"five to nine\" guideline. Depending on the topic, organize the information so there is a maximum of five to nine chunks of information. For example, readers may start to get lost or overwhelmed after about five h2 sections or seven steps into a procedure. If you have more than nine h2 sections or steps, you might need to create an additional doc or procedure. Other organization tools to consider: Levels of headings Lists Collapsers Callouts Tables Code examples For more help section Use action-oriented titles Wherever possible, give your document or h2 heading a task- or action-oriented title. Focus on what users are trying to accomplish or the problem they're trying to solve. Use present-tense verbs, rather than \"-ing\" verbs. Quality Title example Bad The query history Okay View query history Good Query history: Create and edit NRQL queries Start the document with an introductory paragraph Unless the document is less than a single screen in length, begin with a brief paragraph that introduces the topic or summarizes the important points. Not sure where to start? Try writing all the content for your document first, and then add the introduction to the top to summarize your key points. Or use the introduction to expand on the text in your metaDescription in the metadata. Keep documents short The amount of content needed can help you decide whether you need one or more documents for the topic. If all of the document's contents apply directly to the title, then everything belongs in the same document. If several related sections could be logically split into individual documents, and the overall length of your document is more than about two screenfuls, split those sections into other documents. Be sure to include links to the related contents. If a large document needs to be broken into multiple smaller documents, consider whether they might be best grouped together in their own sub-category. Use the New Relic voice We strive for a voice that's approachable, expert, and visionary. Check out our voice guidelines for how to write content with these qualities. And keep in mind these essential writing tips that apply to any type of documentation. Guidelines Comments Be clear and direct. Remember to: Use present tense. Use active voice; avoid passive voice. Tell users what to do, not what they \"should\" do. If absolutely necessary, tell users what not to do in situations where unexpected results may occur. Whenever possible, provide an alternative suggestion when telling users what not to do. Example: Using active voice with an alternative suggestion for what not to do Do not use your config file to change this setting, because this could affect other processes. Instead, go to one.newrelic.com > APM > (select an app or service) > Settings > Application. Write to aid localization and translation. Do not use euphemisms, idioms, jargon, or slang. Use the same terms and wording consistently. If you need to include an abbreviation or acronym, spell it out the first time it appears in the document. Always take a moment to ask yourself whether people will really understand the terms you are using in the way you're using them. Change doc titles and anchors Because changes to doc titles, anchors, and redirects can break links to other docs, please create an issue to request these types of changes and we'll help you out with that. Create and edit categories Because changes to categories can affect large groups of docs at once, please create an issue to request these types of changes and we'll help you out with that.

      "body": "Problem You created a custom infrastructure on-host integration using the Integrations SDK, but you're not seeing data in the infrastructure UI. Solution To troubleshoot and resolve the problem: Verify that your integration meets New Relic Infrastructure's integration requirements. After ruling out common problems with integration requirements, follow the more in-depth troubleshooting procedures for error logs and integration loading. Troubleshoot integration requirements If you are not receiving data from your custom integration, verify that your integration follows these requirements. Integration requirements Comments Environment Make sure your environment meets the Integrations SDK requirements. Configuration file Use a validator such as yamllint to verify that the configuration file is a valid YAML file. Verify that the file is in the correct location. Definition file Use a validator such as yamllint to verify that the definition file is a valid YAML file. Verify that the header fields have the required format. Verify that the prefix for inventory set in the definition file is no more than two levels deep. Verify that the file is in the correct location. Metric sets Verify that the integration: Does not generate metric sets with more than 120 key-value pairs. Does not generate more than 1000 metric sets. JSON payload Verify that the integration does not generate a single JSON payload of more than 5 MB. Check the integration log file for error messages After ruling out common problems with integration requirements, follow these more in-depth troubleshooting procedures. Recommendation: Configure a log file in the Infrastructure agent configuration. This helps separate the types of errors so you can spot integration errors more easily. When there is an error loading or running your integration, the infrastructure agent adds an error message to the log file. Errors are logged even if verbose mode is disabled. Check the log file for lines that include \"level=error\". If there are no error messages, check whether the Infrastructure agent is loading the integration correctly. Check that the integration is loading correctly To verify whether the infrastructure agent is loading the integration correctly: Enable verbose mode in the Infrastructure agent configuration. Restart the Infrastructure agent. Verify that the first lines of the log file contain two messages: \"loaded plugin\" plugin=<your_integration_name> \"found plugin config file\" plugin-path=\"<your_integration_config_path>\" Copy Check for errors just before or after these lines that indicate a problem with loading. The agent schedules data to be sent based on the schedule set in the definition file. Look in the log file for the integration's JSON.

      "body": "These are some organization basics. Organize your page to make it easier to read Consider these organization guidelines when thinking about the order of information in a doc. By following these guidelines, you'll make it easier for readers to skim and find what they need. How to organize information Comments Separate what and why from how. Define any necessary prerequisites, policies, or background information (the what and the why) before you step through the how (step-by-step procedures). Examples: Explain what the feature is and why it matters before telling readers how to use it. Describe any limitations with user permissions or subscription levels that would prevent them from using the feature. If the feature is available for any user or subscription level, don't bother to say so. Provide a roadmap for what users will be able to accomplish, so they know before starting a procedure that they have everything they need. Front-load directions with context. Make sure readers know where they need to be, before telling them what to do. In general, use (select an app) to describe what users select from the product index. Examples: Go to one.newrelic.com > Explorer > (select an app or service). Select (account dropdown) > User preferences. On the command line, type gitk. Also, structure steps by front-loading context from the user's point of view. For example, instead of \"Go to x to do y,\" structure the step as \"To do y, go to x.\" Separate requirements from options. Example: Type the Email you use to sign in and to receive information from New Relic. Optional: Type additional user emails, separated by commas. Follow the \"five to nine\" guideline. Depending on the topic, organize the information so there is a maximum of five to nine chunks of information. For example, readers may start to get lost or overwhelmed after about five h2 sections or seven steps into a procedure. If you have more than nine h2 sections or steps, you might need to create an additional doc or procedure. Other organization tools to consider: Levels of headings Lists Collapsers Callouts Tables Code examples For more help section Use action-oriented titles Wherever possible, give your document or h2 heading a task- or action-oriented title. Focus on what users are trying to accomplish or the problem they're trying to solve. Use present-tense verbs, rather than \"-ing\" verbs. Quality Title example Bad The query history Okay View query history Good Query history: Create and edit NRQL queries Start the document with an introductory paragraph Unless the document is less than a single screen in length, begin with a brief paragraph that introduces the topic or summarizes the important points. Not sure where to start? Try writing all the content for your document first, and then add the introduction to the top to summarize your key points. Or use the introduction to expand on the text in your metaDescription in the metadata. Keep documents short The amount of content needed can help you decide whether you need one or more documents for the topic. If all of the document's contents apply directly to the title, then everything belongs in the same document. If several related sections could be logically split into individual documents, and the overall length of your document is more than about two screenfuls, split those sections into other documents. Be sure to include links to the related contents. If a large document needs to be broken into multiple smaller documents, consider whether they might be best grouped together in their own sub-category. Use the New Relic voice We strive for a voice that's approachable, expert, and visionary. Check out our voice guidelines for how to write content with these qualities. And keep in mind these essential writing tips that apply to any type of documentation. Guidelines Comments Be clear and direct. Remember to: Use present tense. Use active voice; avoid passive voice. Tell users what to do, not what they \"should\" do. If absolutely necessary, tell users what not to do in situations where unexpected results may occur. Whenever possible, provide an alternative suggestion when telling users what not to do. Example: Using active voice with an alternative suggestion for what not to do Do not use your config file to change this setting, because this could affect other processes. Instead, go to one.newrelic.com > APM > (select an app or service) > Settings > Application. Write to aid localization and translation. Do not use euphemisms, idioms, jargon, or slang. Use the same terms and wording consistently. If you need to include an abbreviation or acronym, spell it out the first time it appears in the document. Always take a moment to ask yourself whether people will really understand the terms you are using in the way you're using them. Change doc titles and anchors Because changes to doc titles, anchors, and redirects can break links to other docs, please create an issue to request these types of changes and we'll help you out with that. Create and edit categories Because changes to categories can affect large groups of docs at once, please create an issue to request these types of changes and we'll help you out with that.

      "body": "Problem You created a custom infrastructure on-host integration using the Integrations SDK, but you're not seeing data in the infrastructure UI. Solution To troubleshoot and resolve the problem: Verify that your integration meets New Relic Infrastructure's integration requirements. After ruling out common problems with integration requirements, follow the more in-depth troubleshooting procedures for error logs and integration loading. Troubleshoot integration requirements If you are not receiving data from your custom integration, verify that your integration follows these requirements. Integration requirements Comments Environment Make sure your environment meets the Integrations SDK requirements. Configuration file Use a validator such as yamllint to verify that the configuration file is a valid YAML file. Verify that the file is in the correct location. Definition file Use a validator such as yamllint to verify that the definition file is a valid YAML file. Verify that the header fields have the required format. Verify that the prefix for inventory set in the definition file is no more than two levels deep. Verify that the file is in the correct location. Metric sets Verify that the integration: Does not generate metric sets with more than 120 key-value pairs. Does not generate more than 1000 metric sets. JSON payload Verify that the integration does not generate a single JSON payload of more than 5 MB. Check the integration log file for error messages After ruling out common problems with integration requirements, follow these more in-depth troubleshooting procedures. Recommendation: Configure a log file in the Infrastructure agent configuration. This helps separate the types of errors so you can spot integration errors more easily. When there is an error loading or running your integration, the infrastructure agent adds an error message to the log file. Errors are logged even if verbose mode is disabled. Check the log file for lines that include \"level=error\". If there are no error messages, check whether the Infrastructure agent is loading the integration correctly. Check that the integration is loading correctly To verify whether the infrastructure agent is loading the integration correctly: Enable verbose mode in the Infrastructure agent configuration. Restart the Infrastructure agent. Verify that the first lines of the log file contain two messages: \"loaded plugin\" plugin=<your_integration_name> \"found plugin config file\" plugin-path=\"<your_integration_config_path>\" Copy Check for errors just before or after these lines that indicate a problem with loading. The agent schedules data to be sent based on the schedule set in the definition file. Look in the log file for the integration's JSON. JSON payload example nginx-server-metrics: {\\\"name\\\":\\\"com.newrelic.nginx\\\",\\\"protocol_version\\\":\\\"1\\\",\\\"integration_version\\\":\\\"0.5.0\\\",\\\"metrics\\\": [{\\\"event_type\\\":\\\"NginxSample\\\",\\\"net.connectionsAcceptedPerSecond\\\":0.10344827586206896,\\\"net.connectionsActive\\\":1, \\\"net.connectionsDroppedPerSecond\\\":0,\\\"net.connectionsReading\\\":0,\\\"net.connectionsWaiting\\\":0,\\\"net.connectionsWriting\\\":1, \\\"net.requestsPerSecond\\\":0.10344827586206896,\\\"software.edition\\\":\\\"open source\\\",\\\"software.version\\\":\\\"1.4.6 (Ubuntu)\\\"}],\\\"inventory\\\":{},\\\"events\\\":[]} Copy",

      "body": "When you're creating a new doc, there's a lot to keep track of. You can use this checklist to make sure you've done everything. Title Check that: The doc's title effectively describes the contents. Procedural doc titles use active verbs; for example, Install not Installing. Introduction Check that: The introduction leads with an outcome and provides an overview of how to get there, so customers are confident they've found the right doc. It provides a short, readable overview of the doc's contents. Headings (H2s) Check that: Heading names are concise, yet provide information that helps readers to skim or skip to the section they want. Procedural H2s use active verbs, not the ing verb form. Text Check that the text: Optimizes for easier translation: Avoid idioms, slang, specific cultural references, etc. Tells a good story: Promotes the platform (other New Relic products, alerting, etc.). Includes examples and use cases, identifies personas, explains not only what it is or how to use it but why it matters. Includes hyperlinks in UI paths. Has no typos. Procedures Procedures use active voice and focus on steps (\"do this\"). Avoid burying tips or extra details in the steps. If the procedure includes prerequisites or background information, that information appears before (not buried inside) the ordered list of procedures. If a procedure or step branches, it splits the options so they are clearly visible as bullets, collapsers, etc. If the procedure says what not to do, it also describes what to do instead. Example: What not to do and what to do instead Do not monitor your own applications from the partnership owner account. Instead, create an account within the partnership, and monitor apps from that account. Structure The original tech writer or docs site contributor is the best judge of whether the draft doc is complete. However, in your peer edit, make notes if you have unanswered questions that aren't addressed within the doc or its cross references. Doc structure Comments Complete Check that the overall doc: Is complete, but stays on topic. Includes useful cross references, hyperlinks, and other suggestions to enhance the information, especially for SEO. Skimmable Readers can see at a glance what the doc is about and what to do. It's obvious what parts they can read and what parts they can skip. Visually clean The doc avoids excessive use of callouts, long sentences, or long paragraphs. Useful images For screenshots and images, check that: Full size images always have captions to explain their relevance. UI paths in captions always have hyperlinks. Cropped images clearly show their relevance, with or without captions. In addition, make sure that screenshots and images follow the docs site's security guidelines, and that no private information related to customers or New Relic is displayed. Levels of detail The doc uses H2s, H3s, bullets, tables, and clamshells to organize complex levels of information.",

      "body": "Landing pages are a specialized type of page that serve as the starting pages for various New Relic products. For example, you'll see landing pages for Application monitoring (APM) and Browser monitoring. Important This landing page information does not apply to the docs home page. If you need to create a new landing page, you can either copy an existing landing page, or you can modify the sample landing page shown at the bottom. The next sections look at what you need to include for each landing page. Front matter When you insert the front matter, be sure to designate the type as landingPage. Here's an example: --- title: APM type: landingPage --- Copy Tip In the front matter, the following are optional: tags, translate, and redirects. So, you can leave them out if they don't have any values. Introduction section Following the front matter, the first content section is a two-column introduction (also called the hero section). This includes the following: A <LandingPageHero> component wrapping all the introductory content. A <HeroContent> component wrapping the text portion of the introduction (the content in the left column). An image or video (appears in the right column). A caption (optional), which is wrapped by the <figcaption> component. Here's an example of the hero section that shows you where to insert your content: <LandingPageHero> <HeroContent> INSERT_PARAGRAPHS_FOR_YOUR_INTRODUCTION </HeroContent> ![INSERT_ALT-TEXT_HERE](./images/INSERT_IMAGE_FILE_NAME.png \"INSERT_THE_IMAGE_TITLE_HERE\") <figcaption> INSERT_OPTIONAL_CAPTION_USING_SAME_INDENTATION_AS_IMAGE </figcaption> </LandingPageHero> Copy Tiles Tiles are a series of boxes after the introduction. They contain the main subject areas for your product. You should just list these in order you want them to appear, and the cascading style sheet will render them across the page. Here's an example of a tile: <LandingPageTileGrid> <LandingPageTile title=\"INSERT_YOUR_BOX_TITLE_HERE.\" href=\"/docs/INSERT_THE_DIRECTORY_PATH_TO_THE_TARGET_LANDING_PAGE_INDEX.HTML\" icon=\"fe-INSERT_THE_ICON_NAME\" > INSERT_TILE_CONTENT_HERE... </LandingPageTile> ... Copy For each tile, do the following: Insert a value for title that explains the purpose of the category. Insert a value for href that links to the target landing page. If the target landing page is index.html, you can just include the directory path with no filename since index.html is the default (it doesn't cause any problems if you include index.html). Insert a value for icon by prefixing the icon name with fe- (Feather icons), logo- (third-party logos), or nr- (New Relic logos). For example, here is the format for a feather icon: fe-alert-triangle). Tip For more details about icons, see Embed images. Between the LandingPageTile tags, insert text, such as a bullet list with links to product documentation. Button for viewing all docs in the category After your tiles, you should have a single button that offers to take users to all the documentation for that category. The table of contents page that gets linked here is always at the same path as the landing page, but with /table-of-contents appended to it. These table of contents pages get built automatically for every landing page. For example, if this landing page was located at /docs/apm, this link should be /docs/apm/table-of-contents. Here's an example: <ButtonLink role=\"button\" to=\"INSERT_LINK_TO_DIRECTORY_WITH_ALL_THESE_DOCS/table-of-contents\" variant=\"normal\" > View all INSERT_YOUR_CATEGORY_HERE docs </ButtonLink> Copy Code sample Here's a sample landing page you could modify to suit your needs: --- title: INSERT_YOUR_TITLE_HERE type: landingPage --- <LandingPageHero> <HeroContent> INSERT_PARAGRAPHS_FOR_YOUR_INTRODUCTION </HeroContent> ![INSERT_ALT-TEXT_HERE](./images/INSERT_IMAGE_FILE_NAME.png \"INSERT_THE_IMAGE_TITLE_HERE\") <figcaption> INSERT_OPTIONAL_CAPTION_USING_SAME_INDENTATION_AS_IMAGE </figcaption> </LandingPageHero> <LandingPageTileGrid> <LandingPageTile title=\"INSERT_YOUR_BOX_TITLE_HERE\" icon=\"fe-INSERT_ICON_NAME_HERE\" > * [INSERT_LINK_NAME](INSERT_LINK_URL) Aliquam auctor mattis nisl ut iaculis. * [INSERT_LINK_NAME](INSERT_LINK_URL) Suspendisse pharetra elit sit amet risus euismod, a consectetur tortor vulputate. </LandingPageTile> <LandingPageTile title=\"INSERT_YOUR_BOX_TITLE_HERE\" icon=\"fe-INSERT_ICON_NAME_HERE\" > * Use [INSERT_LINK_NAME](INSERT_LINK_URL) to lectus diam, ornare vitae dui suscipit, laoreet ultrices lacus. * Mauris tempor massa ac augue mattis, nec pharetra quam mollis [INSERT_LINK_NAME](INSERT_LINK_URL). </LandingPageTile> <LandingPageTile title=\"INSERT_YOUR_BOX_TITLE_HERE\" icon=\"fe-INSERT_ICON_NAME_HERE\" > * Use [INSERT_LINK_NAME](INSERT_LINK_URL) rhoncus tortor vitae libero laoreet feugiat. * Donec dui elit, fermentum vel faucibus sed, rhoncus in felis [INSERT_LINK_NAME](INSERT_LINK_URL). </LandingPageTile> <LandingPageTile title=\"INSERT_YOUR_BOX_TITLE_HERE\" icon=\"fe-INSERT_ICON_NAME_HERE\" > * Use [INSERT_LINK_NAME](INSERT_LINK_URL) uspendisse pharetra elit sit amet risus euismod. * Pellentesque finibus magna vitae hendrerit gravida [INSERT_LINK_NAME](INSERT_LINK_URL). </LandingPageTile> <LandingPageTile title=\"INSERT_YOUR_BOX_TITLE_HERE\" icon=\"fe-INSERT_ICON_NAME_HERE\" > * Use [INSERT_LINK_NAME](INSERT_LINK_URL) Etiam imperdiet felis eu ipsum consequat tristique. * Etiam imperdiet felis eu ipsum consequat tristique [INSERT_LINK_NAME](INSERT_LINK_URL). </LandingPageTile> <LandingPageTile title=\"INSERT_YOUR_BOX_TITLE_HERE\" icon=\"fe-INSERT_ICON_NAME_HERE\" > * Use [INSERT_LINK_NAME](INSERT_LINK_URL) Quisque hendrerit, dolor sed sodales aliquet. * Vestibulum varius lectus ac velit euismod [INSERT_LINK_NAME](INSERT_LINK_URL). </LandingPageTile> </LandingPageTileGrid> <ButtonLink role=\"button\" to=\"INSERT_LINK_TO_DIRECTORY_WITH_ALL_THESE_DOCS/table-of-contents\" variant=\"normal\" > View all INSERT_YOUR_CATEGORY_HERE docs </ButtonLink> Copy",

      "body": "This page is for release notes for downloadable software. For product announcements, see What's new style guidelines. New release note To add a release note to the docs site: Find the most recent release note for your agent, and make a copy of it in the same folder. When you rename your copy, avoid potential version naming conflicts by using a - separator in your file name. For example, instead of agent-123, use agent-1-2-3 for version 1.2.3 and agent-12-3 for version 12.3. Fill in the subject, releaseDate, and version. If applicable, include the downloadLink field. Using our standard headings for New features, Improvements, and Bug fixes, add enough summary information in these sections to make a great release note. Link to docs or other resources where they can learn more. Commit your changes and submit a pull request. If your release is date-sensitive, make a note in your PR. A Tech Docs hero will review your release note content and approve your PR to get it published. You can also request others on your team to review your PR. We build and deploy the docs site a few times a day, and sometimes builds can take a few hours to complete. If your release is time-sensitive, ensure you've planned for enough time to get your docs live. What makes a great release note? Great release notes help users quickly become familiar with your important update, so they know why it matters. Great release notes also help our support and security teams. By encouraging users to keep current with your latest release, this reduces support time to solve problems on outdated versions. It also mitigates risks if any potential vulnerabilities have been resolved with your latest version. To write a great release note, be as specific as possible. For example: Briefly describe new functionality. Give an example of the value it provides, and link to more detailed information. Don't use vague wording such as \"various bug fixes.\" Instead, clearly state what has been improved, so readers will know if an issue they’ve experienced has been resolved. New release notes category This information is primarily for the Tech Docs team's use. To add a new release notes category, update the following areas of the docs site. (You do not need to update the releaseNote.js or releaseNoteLandingPage.js files in the nav/templates folder.) Before you submit your pull request to the GitHub docs site, check that the landing pages and placeholder release note build correctly in your localhost. Category landing page In /src/content/docs/release-notes, add the following: A folder for your new release notes category. The RSS feed link, page format, and date order for release notes listed on this page are generated automatically. For example, see the C SDK category landing page format. An index.mdx file in your new folder containing the subject. The subject is the name that will appear on the Release notes landing page. A placeholder release note in this folder for the agent team to fill out. If used, the downloadLink field in the release note will be formatted automatically in the published release note. Before the new category goes live, check with the team's Product Marketing Management (PMM) rep whether they want to include the link in an upcoming What's new post. Landing page In /src/content/docs/release-notes/index.mdx, add a new tile section in alphabetical order for your release notes category. Example: <TechTile name=\"Logs\" icon=\"logo-newrelic\" to=\"/docs/release-notes/logs-release-notes\" /> Copy Logos come from @newrelic/gatsby-theme-newrelic/icons/logo/. If a logo does not already exist for the new agent, use the standard logo-newrelic icon or an image in @newrelic/gatsby-theme-newrelic/icons/feathers.js. If you need other options, talk to the team's designer. Links from other categories Add a link to your new release notes category in the agent's documentation, typically in its Get started category. For more information, see our documentation about docs in multiple menus. Optional: Add a link in the agent's landing page text by updating the index.mdx file in its taxonomy.",

Read on for more information about our page types. Docs meta content (frontmatter) Thr top of every doc begins with a set of metadata. Read on for more information about this metadata content: Meta content field Description Title Whenever possible, provide an action-oriented or task-oriented title; for example, \"AJAX page: Identify time-consuming calls.\" In general, use sentence case. Capitalize only the first word. Do not capitalize any other word in the title unless it's a proper noun, such as a specific product name, or it follows a colon (:). If you're looking for ideas on how to choose a title, browse the titles of similar docs. The title used in the sidebar (left navigation pane) is set in the nav file. type For the basicDoc template, use page or omit type. If omitted, the default type is page and the basicDoc template is used. template The template determines the basic layout and style of a page. Use basicDoc for more pages. tags Keywords related to your doc. Through some technical wizardry, they generate Related resources links in the right nav area. Start each topic with a - on a new line. A topic can include multiple words separated by spaces. japaneseVersion The URL to the Japanese language version of the doc. Leave this blank if there isn't a Japanese version. Document body The document body is where you edit the page content. Use the GitHub Markdown format when you write content. Page templates For most situations, use the basicDoc page template. Read on for information about our other page templates. Content type Description Basic page A standard HTML webpage without special fields. This content type is used for the majority of content on the site. API doc This format is for API reference documentation. For more information, see apiStyleGuidelines (for style guidelines) and Work with the API doc content type (for how to use and configure). Attribute definition This format is for defining attributes and event types. These definitions are shared with the UI via the data dictionary service. For more information, see Work with attribute definition content type. Landing pages This format is for a more user-friendly and readable landing page, which replaces the standard taxonomy list views. For more information, see Working with landing pages. Release notes This format includes specific fields for release notes. Users rely on release notes to keep up with smaller changes in the product, particularly for downloadble software like the agents. For more information, see Create release notes. What's New posts This format includes specific fields for product announcements. What's New posts are created by PMM for larger announcements.

      "body": "When you're creating a new doc, there's a lot to keep track of. You can use this checklist to make sure you've done everything. Title Check that: The doc's title effectively describes the contents. Procedural doc titles use active verbs; for example, Install not Installing. Introduction Check that: The introduction leads with an outcome and provides an overview of how to get there, so customers are confident they've found the right doc. It provides a short, readable overview of the doc's contents. Headings (H2s) Check that: Heading names are concise, yet provide information that helps readers to skim or skip to the section they want. Procedural H2s use active verbs, not the ing verb form. Text Check that the text: Optimizes for easier translation: Avoid idioms, slang, specific cultural references, etc. Tells a good story: Promotes the platform (other New Relic products, alerting, etc.). Includes examples and use cases, identifies personas, explains not only what it is or how to use it but why it matters. Includes hyperlinks in UI paths. Has no typos. Procedures Procedures use active voice and focus on steps (\"do this\"). Avoid burying tips or extra details in the steps. If the procedure includes prerequisites or background information, that information appears before (not buried inside) the ordered list of procedures. If a procedure or step branches, it splits the options so they are clearly visible as bullets, collapsers, etc. If the procedure says what not to do, it also describes what to do instead. Example: What not to do and what to do instead Do not monitor your own applications from the partnership owner account. Instead, create an account within the partnership, and monitor apps from that account. Structure The original tech writer or docs site contributor is the best judge of whether the draft doc is complete. However, in your peer edit, make notes if you have unanswered questions that aren't addressed within the doc or its cross references. Doc structure Comments Complete Check that the overall doc: Is complete, but stays on topic. Includes useful cross references, hyperlinks, and other suggestions to enhance the information, especially for SEO. Skimmable Readers can see at a glance what the doc is about and what to do. It's obvious what parts they can read and what parts they can skip. Visually clean The doc avoids excessive use of callouts, long sentences, or long paragraphs. Useful images For screenshots and images, check that: Full size images always have captions to explain their relevance. UI paths in captions always have hyperlinks. Cropped images clearly show their relevance, with or without captions. In addition, make sure that screenshots and images follow the docs site's security guidelines, and that no private information related to customers or New Relic is displayed. Levels of detail The doc uses H2s, H3s, bullets, tables, and clamshells to organize complex levels of information.",

      "body": "You can proactively monitor your website or API endpoints with synthetic monitors. Depending on the type of monitor, you can: Add and edit monitors. Use the Synthetics REST API to manage monitors. Set up monitors from specific locations or for private servers. You can also use the host not reporting feature in infrastructure monitoring. This allows you to take advantage of enhanced monitoring options and be notified when New Relic has stopped receiving data from your hosts. Types of monitors These are the seven types of synthetic monitors: Type of synthetic monitor Description Broken links monitor API name: SCRIPT_API Provide a url and this monitor will test all the links on the page for success. If a failure is detected you can view the individual non-successful links that caused the failure. Certificate check monitor API name: SCRIPT_API Proactively ping your domain certificates based on a configurable threshold. Pair with an alert to ensure you are notified when your certificates need renewed. Ping monitor API name: SIMPLE Ping monitors are the simplest type of monitor. They simply check to see if an application is online. The synthetic ping monitor uses a simple Java HTTP client to make requests to your site. For consistency with other synthetic monitor types, the user agent is identified as Google Chrome. However, the HTTP client is not a full browser, and it does not execute JavaScript. If you need JavaScript functionality, use a simple browser monitor. Step monitor API name: STEP_MONITOR Step monitors are advanced monitors which require no code to set up. The monitor can be configured to: Assert modal Assert text Assert title Assert an element Click an element Dismiss a modal Double click an element Enter a secure credential Hover over an element Locate an element by CSS class, HTML ID, link text, Xpath, or value Navigate to a URL Select from a dropdown Type text Simple browser monitors API name: BROWSER Simple browser monitors essentially are simple, pre-built scripted browser monitors. They make a request to your site using an instance of Google Chrome. Compared to a simple ping monitor, this is a more accurate emulation of an actual customer visit. The user agent is identified as Google Chrome. Scripted browser monitors API name: SCRIPT_BROWSER Scripted browser monitors are used for more sophisticated, customized monitoring. You can create a custom script that navigates your website, takes specific actions, and ensures specific resources are present. The monitor uses Google Chrome browser. You can also use a variety of third-party modules to build your custom monitor. API tests API name: SCRIPT_API API tests are used to monitor your API endpoints. This can ensure that your app server works in addition to your website. New Relic uses the http-request module internally to make HTTP calls to your endpoint and validate the results. You can add and edit synthetic monitors directly in our UI. You can also create some synthetic monitors with Terraform. To learn how, watch this short YouTube video (approx. 3:25 minutes).",

      "body": "We welcome your contributions, whether you are a New Relic employee or a New Relic user! And we don't want you to worry about style. When you edit a file, tech writers on our team review it for style, grammar, and formatting. That said, if you're curious about our style guidelines, you're welcome (but not obligated) to take a look. Edit a doc If you see a minor problem in our documentation that you want to quickly fix, you can use GitHub to edit the file and submit your pull request. A member of the Docs team will review your edit and publish your changes. We'll follow up with you if we have any questions. To edit existing content without building the site locally: On the docs site, navigate to the doc you'd like to edit. Click Edit page on the top corner of the right nav. A GitHub page will open with the source of the doc. Click the pencil icon in the top right. Make your edits (don't worry too much about formatting or grammar, we're happy to take care of that). At the bottom of the page, enter a commit message that describes your change, then click Commit changes. Follow the prompts to submit your pull request. A member of the Docs team will review your pull request and comment with any feedback. Once we've merged your pull request into the Develop branch, your changes will go live with our next deploy (usually within a few hours). If you'd like to go deeper with development, see our Contributors guide for information on how to fork our site, build it locally, and submit pull requests. Clone (copy) an existing doc Once you've cloned the docs-website repository, use your text editor to copy an existing doc. Rename and edit the copy and then save it as a new doc. Your cloned doc automatically inherits the original doc's frontmatter content. Make sure to change that, too. If you want your cloned doc to be translated, follow standard procedures to request translation. Create new docs You can use article templates or clone an existing doc as a template. To create a new doc: Clone the repo on your computer. In /src/content/docs/, find a good location for your doc. Using your text editor, create a new .mdx file or copy an existing doc. Write your content. Optional: Add your doc to the right nav .yml file. The navigation files can be a bit hard to work with, so feel free to leave this step for a Docs writer to handle when they review your pull request. Commit your changes and create a pull request. The Tech Docs team has two heroes watching for new pull requests. We'll help you get the content finalized and make sure that it's in the right place. For bigger projects If you're making larger changes like adding a whole new doc or editing many existing docs, it can be helpful to run the site locally. For instructions, see Tech writer workflow. Delete pages If you are comfortable with deleting the page yourself, go for it. Note that if a doc is marked for translation, we should also delete it in the i18n folder. To request us to delete something: File an issue in the docs-website repo, or contact the @hero in the #documentation channel if you're a New Relic employee. We'll take a look at your issue and help out. Private edits If you need to stage content for a private beta or limited release, contact the docs hero in the #documentation Slack channel. Request a future publication date (for New Relic employees) If your draft needs to be released on a specific date or within a specific timeframe (for example, right before a release), contact the Tech Docs @hero in the #documentation Slack channel. If you're not a New Relic employee, please create a GitHub issue.",

      "body": "Our five questions form the core of how our Tech Docs team thinks about writing excellent technical documentation. Informally, we call these our 5Qs. Anyone can contribute to our docs site. We want you to feel confident and proud that your contributions provide valuable content and quality. We also want our readers to trust and easily use the information in our docs. To help you plan, write, and edit excellent docs, ask yourself the questions in this doc. There's really only 1Q The 5Qs exist to help answer one question. Whenever you write a doc, ask yourself: What problem are we trying to solve? It's critical you know what you're trying to do and why that goal matters to your readers. Asking the five questions (and the sub-questions!) will help you ensure you're building the right thing. 5Qs and sub-questions Each of the five questions includes sub-questions to help guide your thinking. 1. Did you use or observe the thing you are writing about? Think about who your audience is and the level of complexity they need. End users' point of view Ask yourself: Audience Do you know who is reading your document (dev/ops teams, support personnel, non-technical staff, etc.)? Can you articulate what this thing is (feature, procedure) and why it matters to our customers? For conceptual info, did you interview multiple stakeholders? Testing Put yourself in the user's shoes. For example: Did you use the thing on your own? Did you watch a subject matter expert use the thing? If you can't do it on your own or observe, did you send the draft to at least three SMEs? Before publishing Did you compare the final version of your text against the thing you're writing about? 2. Is this the best place to put this information? Think about where this information belongs. Where does this information belong? Ask yourself: What problem are you trying to solve? Is text always the best answer? Does this doc need to exist at all? For example: Are we duplicating content from somewhere else in the docs site? Are we duplicating content already in the UI? Could customers have a better experience if we modified the UI design or copy instead of creating a doc? Would another web property be a better home for this information? For example: The Explorers Hub? NRU course? NRU video embedded into the doc? The public New Relic blog? The public New Relic website? 3. Can readers tell in ten seconds if they are in the right place? Think about what the content is and what you can do to make the information easy to skim to find information. Can users skim to find information? Ask yourself: Title and headings Does the title accurately represent what's in the doc? Do the headings accurately represent what's in the doc? Do the title and headings use words the way your readers do? Do the title and headings avoid New Relic jargon? Structure Does the overall structure of the doc help readers find what they're looking for? Is the doc trying to address too many topics? When you glance at the doc, do you see short paragraphs, short sentences, and other visual aids? Or do you see a dense wall of text? Introduction Does the intro give a concise synopsis of what's in the doc? Does the intro give readers an alternate path if they're in the wrong place? 4. Is the information in the best possible format? Think about how to present the information visually. Presentation of information Ask yourself: Visual formats Did you use visual formats appropriately? Would a screenshot make any of the information easier to understand? Does your image caption clearly explain what matters so that the user does not necessarily even need to read the surrounding text? Would a diagram make any of the information easier to understand? Is there a video we could embed to make things clearer? Can step-by-step UI procedures be replaced with a \"show me\" video? Procedures Are your procedures well-structured? Do step-by-step UI procedures even need to be documented? Did you limit the procedural text to action steps and omit detailed explanatory text or edge cases? If detailed explanations need to enhance a procedure, have you organized the info in a way that expert users can skip the details? Text flow Read your draft more than once. Is the documentation direct and to the point? Did you use bullets, tables, or clamshells to improve flow? 5. Is the language approachable, expert, and visionary? Think about why the information matters and why readers will trust and use it. For tips to make it easier for users to read, understand, and use documentation, go to plainlanguage.gov. Also, if you are a New Relic employee, we encourage you to review the corporate brand guidelines. For more information, contact Marketing. Effective language Ask yourself: Readers' point of view Did you tell users why as well as how? Can you articulate not only what this thing is (feature, procedure) and also why it matters to our customers? Did you include useful examples or use cases? Did you include information about relationships this feature has to other New Relic platform tools? Style guide resources Did you follow our style guide? Did you use our edit checklist? Did you use pronouns, contractions, and a conversational tone throughout? Did you review the usage dictionary and other resources in the style guide to make sure that terms are used correctly? Readability Is the text easy to read? Is the language clear? Do you have to reread any sentences or paragraphs to understand them? If so, can you simplify the wording and sentence structure? Does the doc score 40 or better on the Flesch-Kinkaid reading ease scale? If not, try taking another pass at the prose. But don't chase the Flesch-Kincaid score in itself: we're not out to frustrate ourselves, but to write docs that are a pleasure to read. Where to go from here Did you offer readers a clear \"next step\" in each section? If it is necessary to tell a user not to do something, did you also tell them what to do instead? Is the topic complete? Is the doc actionable?",

      "body": "When you're creating a new doc, there's a lot to keep track of. You can use this checklist to make sure you've done everything. Title Check that: The doc's title effectively describes the contents. Procedural doc titles use active verbs; for example, Install not Installing. Introduction Check that: The introduction leads with an outcome and provides an overview of how to get there, so customers are confident they've found the right doc. It provides a short, readable overview of the doc's contents. Headings (H2s) Check that: Heading names are concise, yet provide information that helps readers to skim or skip to the section they want. Procedural H2s use active verbs, not the ing verb form. Text Check that the text: Optimizes for easier translation: Avoid idioms, slang, specific cultural references, etc. Tells a good story: Promotes the platform (other New Relic products, alerting, etc.). Includes examples and use cases, identifies personas, explains not only what it is or how to use it but why it matters. Includes hyperlinks in UI paths. Has no typos. Procedures Procedures use active voice and focus on steps (\"do this\"). Avoid burying tips or extra details in the steps. If the procedure includes prerequisites or background information, that information appears before (not buried inside) the ordered list of procedures. If a procedure or step branches, it splits the options so they are clearly visible as bullets, collapsers, etc. If the procedure says what not to do, it also describes what to do instead. Example: What not to do and what to do instead Do not monitor your own applications from the partnership owner account. Instead, create an account within the partnership, and monitor apps from that account. Structure The original tech writer or docs site contributor is the best judge of whether the draft doc is complete. However, in your peer edit, make notes if you have unanswered questions that aren't addressed within the doc or its cross references. Doc structure Comments Complete Check that the overall doc: Is complete, but stays on topic. Includes useful cross references, hyperlinks, and other suggestions to enhance the information, especially for SEO. Skimmable Readers can see at a glance what the doc is about and what to do. It's obvious what parts they can read and what parts they can skip. Visually clean The doc avoids excessive use of callouts, long sentences, or long paragraphs. Useful images For screenshots and images, check that: Full size images always have captions to explain their relevance. UI paths in captions always have hyperlinks. Cropped images clearly show their relevance, with or without captions. In addition, make sure that screenshots and images follow the docs site's security guidelines, and that no private information related to customers or New Relic is displayed. Levels of detail The doc uses H2s, H3s, bullets, tables, and clamshells to organize complex levels of information.",

      "body": "Logs in context for the Java agent connects your logs and APM data in New Relic. Bringing all of this data together in a single tool helps you quickly get to the root cause of an issue and find the log lines that you need to identify and resolve a problem. Set up your Java app To enable logs in context for APM apps monitored by Java: Make sure you have already set up logging in New Relic. This includes configuring a supported log forwarder that collects your application logs and extends the metadata that is forwarded to New Relic. Install or update to the latest Java agent version. Use Java agent version 5.6.0 or higher for logs in context. Enable the JVM argument -javaagent, and enable distributed tracing. Configure logs in context for Java to enrich your log data, using any of the following extensions as applicable. If you use Spring or Spring Boot and aren't sure which extension you need, see our Spring documentation. Dropwizard 1.3 or higher We offer a Dropwizard extension for logs in context with the Java agent. To get started, review the code and an example application on GitHub. To configure logs in context for your Java app with the DropWizard extension: Make sure you have the Dropwizard 1.3 or higher package installed and working on your application. Use the original Dropwizard appenders and logging factory installed and working on the application. Make sure you have the New Relic Java agent version 5.6.0 or higher installed on your application, and that you have enabled the JVM argument -javaagent. Update your project's dependencies to include the Dropwizard 1.3 extension as applicable: Gradle: Add the following to your build.gradle file: dependencies { implementation(\"com.newrelic.logging:dropwizard:2.0\") } Copy Maven: Add the following to your pom.xml file: <dependencies> <dependency> <groupId>com.newrelic.logging</groupId> <artifactId>dropwizard</artifactId> <version>2.0</version> </dependency> </dependencies> Copy Update your Dropwizard .yaml configuration file with a newrelic-json layout, replacing the currently used type: console or type: file with either type: newrelic-console or type: newrelic-file as appropriate. For example: logging: appenders: - type: newrelic-console # Add the two lines below if you don't have a layout specified on the appender. # If you have a layout, remove all parameters to the layout and set the type. layout: type: newrelic-json Copy The New Relic Dropwizard extension also supports a log-format layout type that uses the standard Dropwizard logging. For testing purposes, you can change the type of the layout with a one-line change: logging: appenders: - type: newrelic-file # This format will be ignored by the newrelic-json layout, but used by the log-format layout. logFormat: \"%date{ISO8601} %c %-5p: %m trace.id=%mdc{trace.id} span.id=%mdc{span.id}%n\" layout: # type: newrelic-json type: log-format Copy java.util.logging We offer a java.util.logging extension for logs in context with the Java agent. To get started, review the code and an example application on GitHub. To configure logs in context for your Java app with with the java.util.logging extension: Make sure you have the java.util.logging package installed and working on the application. Make sure you have the New Relic Java agent version 5.6.0 or higher installed on your application, and that you have enabled the JVM argument -javaagent. Update your project's dependencies to include the java.util.logging extension as applicable. If you can't edit these files, you can instead add the jars directly to the application classpath. Gradle: Add the following to your build.gradle file: dependencies { implementation(\"com.newrelic.logging:jul:2.0\") } Copy Maven: Add the following to your pom.xml file: <dependencies> <dependency> <groupId>com.newrelic.logging</groupId> <artifactId>jul</artifactId> <version>2.0</version> </dependency> </dependencies> Copy Check if your logging file's handlers property is set to something other than NewRelicMemoryHandler. Look for a line listing the root logger's handlers, like this: handlers = java.util.logging.FileHandler Copy Update your logging properties file to set the root logger's handler to NewRelicMemoryHandler so it intercepts messages destined for another handler: handlers = com.newrelic.logging.jul.NewRelicMemoryHandler Copy Configure the NewRelicMemoryHandler by setting the target to the handler that was previously assigned to the root logger, so it captures data New Relic needs on the thread the log message is coming from: com.newrelic.logging.jul.NewRelicMemoryHandler.target = java.util.logging.FileHandler Copy Use a NewRelicFormatter for the final handler. Update your logging properties file to set the formatter property like the following example. Make sure the handler where you set the formatter is the target handler from the previous step (java.util.logging.FileHandler in this example). java.util.logging.FileHandler.formatter = com.newrelic.logging.jul. NewRelicFormatter Copy The New Relic log format is JSON with telemetry metadata we use to correlate transactions and logs together. Currently we do not support any customization of that format. Once complete, JSON is logged instead of text. The JSON should be formatted as single objects, one per line, and should contain fields like log.level and thread.name. The trace.id, which is required for logs in context, should only have a value for log messages that occur within a transaction. java.util.logging classpath additions The most direct way to get the logs-in-context extensions is to add these dependencies to Maven's pom.xml or Gradle's build.gradle. This allows the packaging tools to pick up the correct dependencies. If you can't edit these files, you can instead add the jars directly to the application classpath for your logging framework's configuration. Before you modify the classpath: Enable the JVM argument -javaagent on your app's Java agent. Verify which logging framework the application is using. Make sure you are able to change your logging framework's configuration. Add the following three jars to the classpath if they aren't already present. Generally, we recommend taking the latest versions published on Maven Central. Group ID com.newrelic.logging and Artifact ID: Select the artifact named after your application's logging framework in Maven. Group ID com.fasterxml.jackson.core and Artifact ID: Use jackson-core. Group ID com.newrelic.agent.java and Artifact ID: Use newrelic-api. Log4j 1.x We offer a Log4j 1.x extension extension for logs in context with the Java agent. To get started, review the code and an example application on GitHub. To configure logs in context for your Java app with with the Log4j 1.x extension, you must configure the Log4j extension in code or via XML. Properties files are not supported because AsyncAppender instances can only be automatically configured via XML. Make sure you have the Log4j 1.x package installed and working on the application. Make sure you have the New Relic Java agent version 5.6.0 or higher installed on your application, and that you have enabled the JVM argument -javaagent. Update your project's dependencies to include the Log4j 1.x extension as applicable. Gradle: Add the following to your build.gradle file: dependencies { implementation(\"com.newrelic.logging:log4j1:2.0\") } Copy Maven: Add the following to your pom.xml file: <dependencies> <dependency> <groupId>com.newrelic.logging</groupId> <artifactId>log4j1</artifactId> <version>2.0</version> </dependency> </dependencies> Copy In your logging configuration XML file, update your <appender> element with a NewRelicLayout, adding <layout class=\"com.newrelic.logging.log4j1.NewRelicLayout\"/>: <appender name=\" TypicalFile \" class=\"org.apache.log4j.FileAppender\"> <param name=\"file\" value=\"logs/log4j1-app.log\"/> <param name=\"append\" value=\"false\"/> <layout class=\" com.newrelic.logging.log4j1.NewRelicLayout \"/> <!-- only this line needs to be added --> </appender> Copy Use NewRelicAsyncAppender to wrap any appenders that will target New Relic's log forwarder. For example: <appender name=\" NewRelicFile \" class=\"com.newrelic.logging.log4j1.NewRelicAsyncAppender\"> <appender-ref ref=\" TypicalFile \" /> </appender> Copy Use the async appender on the root logger. For example: <root> <appender-ref ref=\" NewRelicFile \" /> </root> Copy Example configuration file for the Log4j 1.x extension: <?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"UTF-8\" ?> <!DOCTYPE log4j:configuration SYSTEM \"log4j.dtd\"> <log4j:configuration debug=\"false\"> <appender name=\"TypicalFile\" class=\"org.apache.log4j.FileAppender\"> <param name=\"file\" value=\"logs/log4j1-app.log\"/> <param name=\"append\" value=\"false\"/> <!-- layout has been replaced --> <layout class=\"com.newrelic.logging.log4j1.NewRelicLayout\"/> </appender> <!-- this appender was added --> <appender name=\"NewRelicFile\" class=\"com.newrelic.logging.log4j1.NewRelicAsyncAppender\"> <appender-ref ref=\"TypicalFile\" /> </appender> <appender name=\"TypicalConsole\" class=\"org.apache.log4j.ConsoleAppender\"> <layout class=\"org.apache.log4j.PatternLayout\"> <param name=\"ConversionPattern\" value=\"%-5p %c{1} - %m%n\"/> </layout> </appender> <root> ​ <!-- the new appender was used here -->​​ <appender-ref ref=\"NewRelicFile\" /> <appender-ref ref=\"TypicalConsole\" /> </root> </log4j:configuration> Copy Log4j 2.x We offer a Log4j 2.x extension for logs in context with the Java agent. To get started, review the code and an example application on GitHub. To configure logs in context for your Java app with with the Log4j 2.x extension: Make sure you have the Log4j 2.13.2 or higher or Logs4j 2 binding package installed and working on your application. Make sure you have the New Relic Java agent version 5.6.0 or higher installed on your application, and that you have enabled the JVM argument -javaagent. Update your project's dependencies to include the Log4j 2.x extension as applicable: Gradle: Add the highlighted section to your build.gradle file: dependencies { implementation(\"com.newrelic.logging:log4j2:2.0\") } Copy Maven: Add the highlighted section to your pom.xml file: <dependencies> <dependency> <groupId>com.newrelic.logging</groupId> <artifactId>log4j2</artifactId> <version>2.0</version> </dependency> </dependencies> Copy In your logging configuration XML file, update your <configuration> element by adding the highlighted section: <Configuration xmlns=\"http://logging.apache.org/log4j/2.0/config\" packages=\"com.newrelic.logging.log4j2\" > Copy If you're using a properties file, add packages=com.newrelic.logging.log4j2. Add <NewRelicLayout/> to use a NewRelicLayout element within one of the appenders. For example: <File name=\"MyFile\" fileName=\"logs/app-log-file.log\"> <NewRelicLayout/> </File> Copy If you're using a properties file, only change the layout.type: appender.console.type = Console appender.console.name = STDOUT appender.console.layout.type = NewRelicLayout Copy If you only modified an existing appender, skip this step. If you added a new appender, add <AppenderRef/> within <Root> to use this appender. Use the ref attribute to refer to appender name you created in the previous step. For example: <Root level=\"info\"> <AppenderRef ref=\"MyFile\"/> </Root> Copy If you're using a properties file and added a new appender, add: rootLogger.level = info rootLogger.appenderRef.stdout.ref = STDOUT ​​​​​ Copy Logback version 1.2.0 or higher We offer a Logback extension for logs in context with the Java agent. To get started, review the code and an example application on GitHub. To configure logs in context for your Java app with Logback: Make sure you have Logback version 1.2.0 or higher and the New Relic Java agent version 5.6.0 or higher installed and working on your application. Make sure you have the New Relic Java agent version 5.6.0 or higher installed on your application, and that you have enabled the JVM argument -javaagent. Update your project's dependencies to include the Logback extension as applicable: Gradle: Add the highlighted section to your build.gradle file: dependencies { implementation(\"com.newrelic.logging:logback:2.0\") } Copy Maven: Add the highlighted section to your pom.xml file: <dependencies> <dependency> <groupId>com.newrelic.logging</groupId> <artifactId>logback</artifactId> <version>2.0</version> </dependency> </dependencies> Copy Update your logging configuration xml to replace any existing <encoder> element. If you're logging to the console (stdout/stderr), look for ConsoleAppender and replace: <appender name=\"STDOUT\" class=\"ch.qos.logback.core.ConsoleAppender\"> <encoder class=\"com.newrelic.logging.logback.NewRelicEncoder\"/> </appender> Copy If you're logging to a file, look for FileAppender and replace <encoder>: <appender name=\"LOG_FILE\" class=\"ch.qos.logback.core.FileAppender\"> <file>logs/app-log-file.log</file> <encoder class=\"com.newrelic.logging.logback.NewRelicEncoder\"/> </appender> Copy Update your logging configuration xml with the NewRelicAsyncAppender. To ensure that NewRelicAsyncAppender wraps any appenders that will target New Relic's log forwarder, add the following section. Change \"LOG_FILE\" to the name of the appender you updated in the previous step. <appender name=\"ASYNC\" class=\"com.newrelic.logging.logback.NewRelicAsyncAppender\"> <appender-ref ref=\"LOG_FILE\" /> </appender> Copy Make sure NewRelicAsyncAppender is the first appender used in your logger. Replace your root logger’s appenders with the ASYNC appender created in the previous step. Then list any other appenders after the NewRelicAsyncAppender in the <root> list. <root> <appender-ref ref=\"ASYNC\" /> </root> Copy Here are examples of an updated logging .xml file for the Logback extension. You can also see a working example in GitHub. Single console appender example Example configuration file after adding in the logging extension information: <configuration> <appender name=\"STDOUT\" class=\"ch.qos.logback.core.ConsoleAppender\"> <!-- changed the encoder --> <encoder class=\"com.newrelic.logging.logback.NewRelicEncoder\"/> </appender> <!-- added the ASYNC appender --> <appender name=\"ASYNC\" class=\"com.newrelic.logging.logback.NewRelicAsyncAppender\"> <appender-ref ref=\"STDOUT\" /> </appender> <root level=\"debug\"> <!-- changed the root logger --> <appender-ref ref=\"ASYNC\" /> </root> </configuration> Copy Two console appenders example This example sends New Relic logging to a file, but still sends standard logging to the console: <configuration> <appender name=\"FILE\" class=\"ch.qos.logback.core.FileAppender\"> <file>myApp.log</file> <!-- encoder changed --> <encoder class=\"com.newrelic.logging.logback.NewRelicEncoder\"/> </appender> <!-- this appender does normal console logging --> <appender name=\"STDOUT\" class=\"ch.qos.logback.core.ConsoleAppender\"> <encoder> <pattern>%msg%n</pattern> </encoder> </appender> <!-- The required New Relic ASYNC appender wraps the FILE appender --> <appender name=\"ASYNC\" class=\"com.newrelic.logging.logback.NewRelicAsyncAppender\"> <appender-ref ref=\"FILE\" /> </appender> <root level=\"debug\"> <!-- ASYNC is one of the main appenders --> <appender-ref ref=\"ASYNC\" /> <!-- Send every message to normal console logging, as well. --> <appender-ref ref=\"STDOUT\" /> </root> </configuration> Copy Spring and Springboot We offer extensions for current versions of Spring and Spring Boot. If you already know the logging library, you can skip directly to that documentation: java.util.logging log4j 1 log4j 2 logback The extensions support default configurations only on Spring Boot 2.0 and higher. With Spring Boot: Here are tips to determine which logging library you have: If you have spring-boot-starter-log4j2 in your dependencies, you're using log4j 2.x. Refer to the Spring Boot log4j 2.x documentation for basic configuration, and the New Relic log4j 2 extension for customizing your configuration. If you're using Spring Boot but not the starter-log4j2, you're using logback by default. Refer to Spring Boot logback documentation for basic configuration, and the New Relic logback extension for customizing your configuration. With Spring (but not Spring Boot): Spring 5 or higher: Spring implements a bridge to other logging libraries that will automatically find them. However, those individual libraries must be configured and explicitly included in your project dependencies. To identify your logging dependency, consult your Gradle, Maven, or other build tool's dependency tree. Then follow the procedures to configure logs in context for your Java app with that extension. Spring 4 or lower: Spring version 4 and lower uses Apache Commons Logging for its bridge. Refer to the Spring documentation for information on configuring its bridge. View logs in UI To verify that you have configured the log appender correctly, run your application, then check your logs data in New Relic One using the query operator has:span.id has:trace.id. If everything is configured correctly and your data is being forwarded to New Relic with the enriched metadata, your logs should now be emitted as JSON and contain trace.id and span.id fields. If you don't see log data in the UI, follow the troubleshooting procedures. What's next? After you set up APM logs in context, make the most of your logging data: Explore the logging data across your platform with our Logs UI. See your logs in context of your app's performance in the APM UI. Troubleshoot errors with distributed tracing, stack traces, application logs, and more. Get deeper visibility into both your application and your platform performance data by forwarding your logs with our infrastructure monitoring agent. Review your infrastructure logs in the UI. Set up alerts. Query your data and create dashboards.",

When you edit a file, tech writers on our team review it for style, grammar, and formatting. That said, if you're curious about our style guidelines, you're welcome (but not obligated) to take a look. Edit a doc If you see a minor problem in our documentation that you want to quickly fix, you can use GitHub to edit the file and submit your pull request. A member of the Docs team will review your edit and publish your changes. We'll follow up with you if we have any questions. To edit existing content without building the site locally: On the docs site, navigate to the doc you'd like to edit. Click Edit page on the top corner of the right nav. A GitHub page will open with the source of the doc. Click the pencil icon in the top right. Make your edits (don't worry too much about formatting or grammar, we're happy to take care of that). At the bottom of the page, enter a commit message that describes your change, then click Commit changes. Follow the prompts to submit your pull request. A member of the Docs team will review your pull request and comment with any feedback. Once we've merged your pull request into the Develop branch, your changes will go live with our next deploy (usually within a few hours). If you'd like to go deeper with development, see our Contributors guide for information on how to fork our site, build it locally, and submit pull requests. Clone (copy) an existing doc Once you've cloned the docs-website repository, use your text editor to copy an existing doc. Rename and edit the copy and then save it as a new doc. Your cloned doc automatically inherits the original doc's frontmatter content. Make sure to change that, too. If you want your cloned doc to be translated, follow standard procedures to request translation. Create new docs You can use article templates or clone an existing doc as a template. To create a new doc: Clone the repo on your computer. In /src/content/docs/, find a good location for your doc. Using your text editor, create a new .mdx file or copy an existing doc. Write your content. Optional: Add your doc to the right nav .yml file. The navigation files can be a bit hard to work with, so feel free to leave this step for a Docs writer to handle when they review your pull request. Commit your changes and create a pull request. The Tech Docs team has two heroes watching for new pull requests. We'll help you get the content finalized and make sure that it's in the right place. For bigger projects If you're making larger changes like adding a whole new doc or editing many existing docs, it can be helpful to run the site locally. For instructions, see Tech writer workflow. Delete pages If you are comfortable with deleting the page yourself, go for it. Note that if a doc is marked for translation, we should also delete it in the i18n folder. To request us to delete something: File an issue in the docs-website repo, or contact the @hero in the #documentation channel if you're a New Relic employee. We'll take a look at your issue and help out. Private edits If you need to stage content for a private beta or limited release, contact the docs hero in the #documentation Slack channel. Request a future publication date (for New Relic employees) If your draft needs to be released on a specific date or within a specific timeframe (for example, right before a release), contact the Tech Docs @hero in the #documentation Slack channel. If you're not a New Relic employee, please create a GitHub issue.",

      "body": "Logs in context for the Java agent connects your logs and APM data in New Relic. Bringing all of this data together in a single tool helps you quickly get to the root cause of an issue and find the log lines that you need to identify and resolve a problem. Set up your Java app To enable logs in context for APM apps monitored by Java: Make sure you have already set up logging in New Relic. This includes configuring a supported log forwarder that collects your application logs and extends the metadata that is forwarded to New Relic. Install or update to the latest Java agent version. Use Java agent version 5.6.0 or higher for logs in context. Enable the JVM argument -javaagent, and enable distributed tracing. Configure logs in context for Java to enrich your log data, using any of the following extensions as applicable. If you use Spring or Spring Boot and aren't sure which extension you need, see our Spring documentation. Dropwizard 1.3 or higher We offer a Dropwizard extension for logs in context with the Java agent. To get started, review the code and an example application on GitHub. To configure logs in context for your Java app with the DropWizard extension: Make sure you have the Dropwizard 1.3 or higher package installed and working on your application. Use the original Dropwizard appenders and logging factory installed and working on the application. Make sure you have the New Relic Java agent version 5.6.0 or higher installed on your application, and that you have enabled the JVM argument -javaagent. Update your project's dependencies to include the Dropwizard 1.3 extension as applicable: Gradle: Add the following to your build.gradle file: dependencies { implementation(\"com.newrelic.logging:dropwizard:2.0\") } Copy Maven: Add the following to your pom.xml file: <dependencies> <dependency> <groupId>com.newrelic.logging</groupId> <artifactId>dropwizard</artifactId> <version>2.0</version> </dependency> </dependencies> Copy Update your Dropwizard .yaml configuration file with a newrelic-json layout, replacing the currently used type: console or type: file with either type: newrelic-console or type: newrelic-file as appropriate. For example: logging: appenders: - type: newrelic-console # Add the two lines below if you don't have a layout specified on the appender. # If you have a layout, remove all parameters to the layout and set the type. layout: type: newrelic-json Copy The New Relic Dropwizard extension also supports a log-format layout type that uses the standard Dropwizard logging. For testing purposes, you can change the type of the layout with a one-line change: logging: appenders: - type: newrelic-file # This format will be ignored by the newrelic-json layout, but used by the log-format layout. logFormat: \"%date{ISO8601} %c %-5p: %m trace.id=%mdc{trace.id} span.id=%mdc{span.id}%n\" layout: # type: newrelic-json type: log-format Copy java.util.logging We offer a java.util.logging extension for logs in context with the Java agent. To get started, review the code and an example application on GitHub. To configure logs in context for your Java app with with the java.util.logging extension: Make sure you have the java.util.logging package installed and working on the application. Make sure you have the New Relic Java agent version 5.6.0 or higher installed on your application, and that you have enabled the JVM argument -javaagent. Update your project's dependencies to include the java.util.logging extension as applicable. If you can't edit these files, you can instead add the jars directly to the application classpath. Gradle: Add the following to your build.gradle file: dependencies { implementation(\"com.newrelic.logging:jul:2.0\") } Copy Maven: Add the following to your pom.xml file: <dependencies> <dependency> <groupId>com.newrelic.logging</groupId> <artifactId>jul</artifactId> <version>2.0</version> </dependency> </dependencies> Copy Check if your logging file's handlers property is set to something other than NewRelicMemoryHandler. Look for a line listing the root logger's handlers, like this: handlers = java.util.logging.FileHandler Copy Update your logging properties file to set the root logger's handler to NewRelicMemoryHandler so it intercepts messages destined for another handler: handlers = com.newrelic.logging.jul.NewRelicMemoryHandler Copy Configure the NewRelicMemoryHandler by setting the target to the handler that was previously assigned to the root logger, so it captures data New Relic needs on the thread the log message is coming from: com.newrelic.logging.jul.NewRelicMemoryHandler.target = java.util.logging.FileHandler Copy Use a NewRelicFormatter for the final handler. Update your logging properties file to set the formatter property like the following example. Make sure the handler where you set the formatter is the target handler from the previous step (java.util.logging.FileHandler in this example). java.util.logging.FileHandler.formatter = com.newrelic.logging.jul. NewRelicFormatter Copy The New Relic log format is JSON with telemetry metadata we use to correlate transactions and logs together. Currently we do not support any customization of that format. Once complete, JSON is logged instead of text. The JSON should be formatted as single objects, one per line, and should contain fields like log.level and thread.name. The trace.id, which is required for logs in context, should only have a value for log messages that occur within a transaction. java.util.logging classpath additions The most direct way to get the logs-in-context extensions is to add these dependencies to Maven's pom.xml or Gradle's build.gradle. This allows the packaging tools to pick up the correct dependencies. If you can't edit these files, you can instead add the jars directly to the application classpath for your logging framework's configuration. Before you modify the classpath: Enable the JVM argument -javaagent on your app's Java agent. Verify which logging framework the application is using. Make sure you are able to change your logging framework's configuration. Add the following three jars to the classpath if they aren't already present. Generally, we recommend taking the latest versions published on Maven Central. Group ID com.newrelic.logging and Artifact ID: Select the artifact named after your application's logging framework in Maven. Group ID com.fasterxml.jackson.core and Artifact ID: Use jackson-core. Group ID com.newrelic.agent.java and Artifact ID: Use newrelic-api. Log4j 1.x We offer a Log4j 1.x extension extension for logs in context with the Java agent. To get started, review the code and an example application on GitHub. To configure logs in context for your Java app with with the Log4j 1.x extension, you must configure the Log4j extension in code or via XML. Properties files are not supported because AsyncAppender instances can only be automatically configured via XML. Make sure you have the Log4j 1.x package installed and working on the application. Make sure you have the New Relic Java agent version 5.6.0 or higher installed on your application, and that you have enabled the JVM argument -javaagent. Update your project's dependencies to include the Log4j 1.x extension as applicable. Gradle: Add the following to your build.gradle file: dependencies { implementation(\"com.newrelic.logging:log4j1:2.0\") } Copy Maven: Add the following to your pom.xml file: <dependencies> <dependency> <groupId>com.newrelic.logging</groupId> <artifactId>log4j1</artifactId> <version>2.0</version> </dependency> </dependencies> Copy In your logging configuration XML file, update your <appender> element with a NewRelicLayout, adding <layout class=\"com.newrelic.logging.log4j1.NewRelicLayout\"/>: <appender name=\" TypicalFile \" class=\"org.apache.log4j.FileAppender\"> <param name=\"file\" value=\"logs/log4j1-app.log\"/> <param name=\"append\" value=\"false\"/> <layout class=\" com.newrelic.logging.log4j1.NewRelicLayout \"/> <!-- only this line needs to be added --> </appender> Copy Use NewRelicAsyncAppender to wrap any appenders that will target New Relic's log forwarder. For example: <appender name=\" NewRelicFile \" class=\"com.newrelic.logging.log4j1.NewRelicAsyncAppender\"> <appender-ref ref=\" TypicalFile \" /> </appender> Copy Use the async appender on the root logger. For example: <root> <appender-ref ref=\" NewRelicFile \" /> </root> Copy Example configuration file for the Log4j 1.x extension: <?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"UTF-8\" ?> <!DOCTYPE log4j:configuration SYSTEM \"log4j.dtd\"> <log4j:configuration debug=\"false\"> <appender name=\"TypicalFile\" class=\"org.apache.log4j.FileAppender\"> <param name=\"file\" value=\"logs/log4j1-app.log\"/> <param name=\"append\" value=\"false\"/> <!-- layout has been replaced --> <layout class=\"com.newrelic.logging.log4j1.NewRelicLayout\"/> </appender> <!-- this appender was added --> <appender name=\"NewRelicFile\" class=\"com.newrelic.logging.log4j1.NewRelicAsyncAppender\"> <appender-ref ref=\"TypicalFile\" /> </appender> <appender name=\"TypicalConsole\" class=\"org.apache.log4j.ConsoleAppender\"> <layout class=\"org.apache.log4j.PatternLayout\"> <param name=\"ConversionPattern\" value=\"%-5p %c{1} - %m%n\"/> </layout> </appender> <root> ​ <!-- the new appender was used here -->​​ <appender-ref ref=\"NewRelicFile\" /> <appender-ref ref=\"TypicalConsole\" /> </root> </log4j:configuration> Copy Log4j 2.x We offer a Log4j 2.x extension for logs in context with the Java agent. To get started, review the code and an example application on GitHub. To configure logs in context for your Java app with with the Log4j 2.x extension: Make sure you have the Log4j 2.13.2 or higher or Logs4j 2 binding package installed and working on your application. Make sure you have the New Relic Java agent version 5.6.0 or higher installed on your application, and that you have enabled the JVM argument -javaagent. Update your project's dependencies to include the Log4j 2.x extension as applicable: Gradle: Add the highlighted section to your build.gradle file: dependencies { implementation(\"com.newrelic.logging:log4j2:2.0\") } Copy Maven: Add the highlighted section to your pom.xml file: <dependencies> <dependency> <groupId>com.newrelic.logging</groupId> <artifactId>log4j2</artifactId> <version>2.0</version> </dependency> </dependencies> Copy In your logging configuration XML file, update your <configuration> element by adding the highlighted section: <Configuration xmlns=\"http://logging.apache.org/log4j/2.0/config\" packages=\"com.newrelic.logging.log4j2\" > Copy If you're using a properties file, add packages=com.newrelic.logging.log4j2. Add <NewRelicLayout/> to use a NewRelicLayout element within one of the appenders. For example: <File name=\"MyFile\" fileName=\"logs/app-log-file.log\"> <NewRelicLayout/> </File> Copy If you're using a properties file, only change the layout.type: appender.console.type = Console appender.console.name = STDOUT appender.console.layout.type = NewRelicLayout Copy If you only modified an existing appender, skip this step. If you added a new appender, add <AppenderRef/> within <Root> to use this appender. Use the ref attribute to refer to appender name you created in the previous step. For example: <Root level=\"info\"> <AppenderRef ref=\"MyFile\"/> </Root> Copy If you're using a properties file and added a new appender, add: rootLogger.level = info rootLogger.appenderRef.stdout.ref = STDOUT ​​​​​ Copy Logback version 1.2.0 or higher We offer a Logback extension for logs in context with the Java agent. To get started, review the code and an example application on GitHub. To configure logs in context for your Java app with Logback: Make sure you have Logback version 1.2.0 or higher and the New Relic Java agent version 5.6.0 or higher installed and working on your application. Make sure you have the New Relic Java agent version 5.6.0 or higher installed on your application, and that you have enabled the JVM argument -javaagent. Update your project's dependencies to include the Logback extension as applicable: Gradle: Add the highlighted section to your build.gradle file: dependencies { implementation(\"com.newrelic.logging:logback:2.0\") } Copy Maven: Add the highlighted section to your pom.xml file: <dependencies> <dependency> <groupId>com.newrelic.logging</groupId> <artifactId>logback</artifactId> <version>2.0</version> </dependency> </dependencies> Copy Update your logging configuration xml to replace any existing <encoder> element. If you're logging to the console (stdout/stderr), look for ConsoleAppender and replace: <appender name=\"STDOUT\" class=\"ch.qos.logback.core.ConsoleAppender\"> <encoder class=\"com.newrelic.logging.logback.NewRelicEncoder\"/> </appender> Copy If you're logging to a file, look for FileAppender and replace <encoder>: <appender name=\"LOG_FILE\" class=\"ch.qos.logback.core.FileAppender\"> <file>logs/app-log-file.log</file> <encoder class=\"com.newrelic.logging.logback.NewRelicEncoder\"/> </appender> Copy Update your logging configuration xml with the NewRelicAsyncAppender. To ensure that NewRelicAsyncAppender wraps any appenders that will target New Relic's log forwarder, add the following section. Change \"LOG_FILE\" to the name of the appender you updated in the previous step. <appender name=\"ASYNC\" class=\"com.newrelic.logging.logback.NewRelicAsyncAppender\"> <appender-ref ref=\"LOG_FILE\" /> </appender> Copy Make sure NewRelicAsyncAppender is the first appender used in your logger. Replace your root logger’s appenders with the ASYNC appender created in the previous step. Then list any other appenders after the NewRelicAsyncAppender in the <root> list. <root> <appender-ref ref=\"ASYNC\" /> </root> Copy Here are examples of an updated logging .xml file for the Logback extension. You can also see a working example in GitHub. Single console appender example Example configuration file after adding in the logging extension information: <configuration> <appender name=\"STDOUT\" class=\"ch.qos.logback.core.ConsoleAppender\"> <!-- changed the encoder --> <encoder class=\"com.newrelic.logging.logback.NewRelicEncoder\"/> </appender> <!-- added the ASYNC appender --> <appender name=\"ASYNC\" class=\"com.newrelic.logging.logback.NewRelicAsyncAppender\"> <appender-ref ref=\"STDOUT\" /> </appender> <root level=\"debug\"> <!-- changed the root logger --> <appender-ref ref=\"ASYNC\" /> </root> </configuration> Copy Two console appenders example This example sends New Relic logging to a file, but still sends standard logging to the console: <configuration> <appender name=\"FILE\" class=\"ch.qos.logback.core.FileAppender\"> <file>myApp.log</file> <!-- encoder changed --> <encoder class=\"com.newrelic.logging.logback.NewRelicEncoder\"/> </appender> <!-- this appender does normal console logging --> <appender name=\"STDOUT\" class=\"ch.qos.logback.core.ConsoleAppender\"> <encoder> <pattern>%msg%n</pattern> </encoder> </appender> <!-- The required New Relic ASYNC appender wraps the FILE appender --> <appender name=\"ASYNC\" class=\"com.newrelic.logging.logback.NewRelicAsyncAppender\"> <appender-ref ref=\"FILE\" /> </appender> <root level=\"debug\"> <!-- ASYNC is one of the main appenders --> <appender-ref ref=\"ASYNC\" /> <!-- Send every message to normal console logging, as well. --> <appender-ref ref=\"STDOUT\" /> </root> </configuration> Copy Spring and Springboot We offer extensions for current versions of Spring and Spring Boot. If you already know the logging library, you can skip directly to that documentation: java.util.logging log4j 1 log4j 2 logback The extensions support default configurations only on Spring Boot 2.0 and higher. With Spring Boot: Here are tips to determine which logging library you have: If you have spring-boot-starter-log4j2 in your dependencies, you're using log4j 2.x. Refer to the Spring Boot log4j 2.x documentation for basic configuration, and the New Relic log4j 2 extension for customizing your configuration. If you're using Spring Boot but not the starter-log4j2, you're using logback by default. Refer to Spring Boot logback documentation for basic configuration, and the New Relic logback extension for customizing your configuration. With Spring (but not Spring Boot): Spring 5 or higher: Spring implements a bridge to other logging libraries that will automatically find them. However, those individual libraries must be configured and explicitly included in your project dependencies. To identify your logging dependency, consult your Gradle, Maven, or other build tool's dependency tree. Then follow the procedures to configure logs in context for your Java app with that extension. Spring 4 or lower: Spring version 4 and lower uses Apache Commons Logging for its bridge. Refer to the Spring documentation for information on configuring its bridge. View logs in UI To verify that you have configured the log appender correctly, run your application, then check your logs data in New Relic One using the query operator has:span.id has:trace.id. If everything is configured correctly and your data is being forwarded to New Relic with the enriched metadata, your logs should now be emitted as JSON and contain trace.id and span.id fields. If you don't see log data in the UI, follow the troubleshooting procedures. What's next? After you set up APM logs in context, make the most of your logging data: Explore the logging data across your platform with our Logs UI. See your logs in context of your app's performance in the APM UI. Troubleshoot errors with distributed tracing, stack traces, application logs, and more. Get deeper visibility into both your application and your platform performance data by forwarding your logs with our infrastructure monitoring agent. Review your infrastructure logs in the UI. Set up alerts. Query your data and create dashboards.",

When you edit a file, tech writers on our team review it for style, grammar, and formatting. That said, if you're curious about our style guidelines, you're welcome (but not obligated) to take a look. Edit a doc If you see a minor problem in our documentation that you want to quickly fix, you can use GitHub to edit the file and submit your pull request. A member of the Docs team will review your edit and publish your changes. We'll follow up with you if we have any questions. To edit existing content without building the site locally: On the docs site, navigate to the doc you'd like to edit. Click Edit page on the top corner of the right nav. A GitHub page will open with the source of the doc. Click the pencil icon in the top right. Make your edits (don't worry too much about formatting or grammar, we're happy to take care of that). At the bottom of the page, enter a commit message that describes your change, then click Commit changes. Follow the prompts to submit your pull request. A member of the Docs team will review your pull request and comment with any feedback. Once we've merged your pull request into the Develop branch, your changes will go live with our next deploy (usually within a few hours). If you'd like to go deeper with development, see our Contributors guide for information on how to fork our site, build it locally, and submit pull requests. Clone (copy) an existing doc Once you've cloned the docs-website repository, use your text editor to copy an existing doc. Rename and edit the copy and then save it as a new doc. Your cloned doc automatically inherits the original doc's frontmatter content. Make sure to change that, too. If you want your cloned doc to be translated, follow standard procedures to request translation. Create new docs You can use article templates or clone an existing doc as a template. To create a new doc: Clone the repo on your computer. In /src/content/docs/, find a good location for your doc. Using your text editor, create a new .mdx file or copy an existing doc. Write your content. Optional: Add your doc to the right nav .yml file. The navigation files can be a bit hard to work with, so feel free to leave this step for a Docs writer to handle when they review your pull request. Commit your changes and create a pull request. The Tech Docs team has two heroes watching for new pull requests. We'll help you get the content finalized and make sure that it's in the right place. For bigger projects If you're making larger changes like adding a whole new doc or editing many existing docs, it can be helpful to run the site locally. For instructions, see Tech writer workflow. Delete pages If you are comfortable with deleting the page yourself, go for it. Note that if a doc is marked for translation, we should also delete it in the i18n folder. To request us to delete something: File an issue in the docs-website repo, or contact the @hero in the #documentation channel if you're a New Relic employee. We'll take a look at your issue and help out. Private edits If you need to stage content for a private beta or limited release, contact the docs hero in the #documentation Slack channel. Request a future publication date (for New Relic employees) If your draft needs to be released on a specific date or within a specific timeframe (for example, right before a release), contact the Tech Docs @hero in the #documentation Slack channel.

      "body": "Logs in context for the Java agent connects your logs and APM data in New Relic. Bringing all of this data together in a single tool helps you quickly get to the root cause of an issue and find the log lines that you need to identify and resolve a problem. Set up your Java app To enable logs in context for APM apps monitored by Java: Make sure you have already set up logging in New Relic. This includes configuring a supported log forwarder that collects your application logs and extends the metadata that is forwarded to New Relic. Install or update to the latest Java agent version. Use Java agent version 5.6.0 or higher for logs in context. Enable the JVM argument -javaagent, and enable distributed tracing. Configure logs in context for Java to enrich your log data, using any of the following extensions as applicable. If you use Spring or Spring Boot and aren't sure which extension you need, see our Spring documentation. Dropwizard 1.3 or higher We offer a Dropwizard extension for logs in context with the Java agent. To get started, review the code and an example application on GitHub. To configure logs in context for your Java app with the DropWizard extension: Make sure you have the Dropwizard 1.3 or higher package installed and working on your application. Use the original Dropwizard appenders and logging factory installed and working on the application. Make sure you have the New Relic Java agent version 5.6.0 or higher installed on your application, and that you have enabled the JVM argument -javaagent. Update your project's dependencies to include the Dropwizard 1.3 extension as applicable: Gradle: Add the following to your build.gradle file: dependencies { implementation(\"com.newrelic.logging:dropwizard:2.0\") } Copy Maven: Add the following to your pom.xml file: <dependencies> <dependency> <groupId>com.newrelic.logging</groupId> <artifactId>dropwizard</artifactId> <version>2.0</version> </dependency> </dependencies> Copy Update your Dropwizard .yaml configuration file with a newrelic-json layout, replacing the currently used type: console or type: file with either type: newrelic-console or type: newrelic-file as appropriate. For example: logging: appenders: - type: newrelic-console # Add the two lines below if you don't have a layout specified on the appender. # If you have a layout, remove all parameters to the layout and set the type. layout: type: newrelic-json Copy The New Relic Dropwizard extension also supports a log-format layout type that uses the standard Dropwizard logging. For testing purposes, you can change the type of the layout with a one-line change: logging: appenders: - type: newrelic-file # This format will be ignored by the newrelic-json layout, but used by the log-format layout. logFormat: \"%date{ISO8601} %c %-5p: %m trace.id=%mdc{trace.id} span.id=%mdc{span.id}%n\" layout: # type: newrelic-json type: log-format Copy java.util.logging We offer a java.util.logging extension for logs in context with the Java agent. To get started, review the code and an example application on GitHub. To configure logs in context for your Java app with with the java.util.logging extension: Make sure you have the java.util.logging package installed and working on the application. Make sure you have the New Relic Java agent version 5.6.0 or higher installed on your application, and that you have enabled the JVM argument -javaagent. Update your project's dependencies to include the java.util.logging extension as applicable. If you can't edit these files, you can instead add the jars directly to the application classpath. Gradle: Add the following to your build.gradle file: dependencies { implementation(\"com.newrelic.logging:jul:2.0\") } Copy Maven: Add the following to your pom.xml file: <dependencies> <dependency> <groupId>com.newrelic.logging</groupId> <artifactId>jul</artifactId> <version>2.0</version> </dependency> </dependencies> Copy Check if your logging file's handlers property is set to something other than NewRelicMemoryHandler. Look for a line listing the root logger's handlers, like this: handlers = java.util.logging.FileHandler Copy Update your logging properties file to set the root logger's handler to NewRelicMemoryHandler so it intercepts messages destined for another handler: handlers = com.newrelic.logging.jul.NewRelicMemoryHandler Copy Configure the NewRelicMemoryHandler by setting the target to the handler that was previously assigned to the root logger, so it captures data New Relic needs on the thread the log message is coming from: com.newrelic.logging.jul.NewRelicMemoryHandler.target = java.util.logging.FileHandler Copy Use a NewRelicFormatter for the final handler. Update your logging properties file to set the formatter property like the following example. Make sure the handler where you set the formatter is the target handler from the previous step (java.util.logging.FileHandler in this example). java.util.logging.FileHandler.formatter = com.newrelic.logging.jul. NewRelicFormatter Copy The New Relic log format is JSON with telemetry metadata we use to correlate transactions and logs together. Currently we do not support any customization of that format. Once complete, JSON is logged instead of text. The JSON should be formatted as single objects, one per line, and should contain fields like log.level and thread.name. The trace.id, which is required for logs in context, should only have a value for log messages that occur within a transaction. java.util.logging classpath additions The most direct way to get the logs-in-context extensions is to add these dependencies to Maven's pom.xml or Gradle's build.gradle. This allows the packaging tools to pick up the correct dependencies. If you can't edit these files, you can instead add the jars directly to the application classpath for your logging framework's configuration. Before you modify the classpath: Enable the JVM argument -javaagent on your app's Java agent. Verify which logging framework the application is using. Make sure you are able to change your logging framework's configuration. Add the following three jars to the classpath if they aren't already present. Generally, we recommend taking the latest versions published on Maven Central. Group ID com.newrelic.logging and Artifact ID: Select the artifact named after your application's logging framework in Maven. Group ID com.fasterxml.jackson.core and Artifact ID: Use jackson-core. Group ID com.newrelic.agent.java and Artifact ID: Use newrelic-api. Log4j 1.x We offer a Log4j 1.x extension extension for logs in context with the Java agent. To get started, review the code and an example application on GitHub. To configure logs in context for your Java app with with the Log4j 1.x extension, you must configure the Log4j extension in code or via XML. Properties files are not supported because AsyncAppender instances can only be automatically configured via XML. Make sure you have the Log4j 1.x package installed and working on the application. Make sure you have the New Relic Java agent version 5.6.0 or higher installed on your application, and that you have enabled the JVM argument -javaagent. Update your project's dependencies to include the Log4j 1.x extension as applicable. Gradle: Add the following to your build.gradle file: dependencies { implementation(\"com.newrelic.logging:log4j1:2.0\") } Copy Maven: Add the following to your pom.xml file: <dependencies> <dependency> <groupId>com.newrelic.logging</groupId> <artifactId>log4j1</artifactId> <version>2.0</version> </dependency> </dependencies> Copy In your logging configuration XML file, update your <appender> element with a NewRelicLayout, adding <layout class=\"com.newrelic.logging.log4j1.NewRelicLayout\"/>: <appender name=\" TypicalFile \" class=\"org.apache.log4j.FileAppender\"> <param name=\"file\" value=\"logs/log4j1-app.log\"/> <param name=\"append\" value=\"false\"/> <layout class=\" com.newrelic.logging.log4j1.NewRelicLayout \"/> <!-- only this line needs to be added --> </appender> Copy Use NewRelicAsyncAppender to wrap any appenders that will target New Relic's log forwarder. For example: <appender name=\" NewRelicFile \" class=\"com.newrelic.logging.log4j1.NewRelicAsyncAppender\"> <appender-ref ref=\" TypicalFile \" /> </appender> Copy Use the async appender on the root logger. For example: <root> <appender-ref ref=\" NewRelicFile \" /> </root> Copy Example configuration file for the Log4j 1.x extension: <?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"UTF-8\" ?> <!DOCTYPE log4j:configuration SYSTEM \"log4j.dtd\"> <log4j:configuration debug=\"false\"> <appender name=\"TypicalFile\" class=\"org.apache.log4j.FileAppender\"> <param name=\"file\" value=\"logs/log4j1-app.log\"/> <param name=\"append\" value=\"false\"/> <!-- layout has been replaced --> <layout class=\"com.newrelic.logging.log4j1.NewRelicLayout\"/> </appender> <!-- this appender was added --> <appender name=\"NewRelicFile\" class=\"com.newrelic.logging.log4j1.NewRelicAsyncAppender\"> <appender-ref ref=\"TypicalFile\" /> </appender> <appender name=\"TypicalConsole\" class=\"org.apache.log4j.ConsoleAppender\"> <layout class=\"org.apache.log4j.PatternLayout\"> <param name=\"ConversionPattern\" value=\"%-5p %c{1} - %m%n\"/> </layout> </appender> <root> ​ <!-- the new appender was used here -->​​ <appender-ref ref=\"NewRelicFile\" /> <appender-ref ref=\"TypicalConsole\" /> </root> </log4j:configuration> Copy Log4j 2.x We offer a Log4j 2.x extension for logs in context with the Java agent. To get started, review the code and an example application on GitHub. To configure logs in context for your Java app with with the Log4j 2.x extension: Make sure you have the Log4j 2.13.2 or higher or Logs4j 2 binding package installed and working on your application. Make sure you have the New Relic Java agent version 5.6.0 or higher installed on your application, and that you have enabled the JVM argument -javaagent. Update your project's dependencies to include the Log4j 2.x extension as applicable: Gradle: Add the highlighted section to your build.gradle file: dependencies { implementation(\"com.newrelic.logging:log4j2:2.0\") } Copy Maven: Add the highlighted section to your pom.xml file: <dependencies> <dependency> <groupId>com.newrelic.logging</groupId> <artifactId>log4j2</artifactId> <version>2.0</version> </dependency> </dependencies> Copy In your logging configuration XML file, update your <configuration> element by adding the highlighted section: <Configuration xmlns=\"http://logging.apache.org/log4j/2.0/config\" packages=\"com.newrelic.logging.log4j2\" > Copy If you're using a properties file, add packages=com.newrelic.logging.log4j2. Add <NewRelicLayout/> to use a NewRelicLayout element within one of the appenders. For example: <File name=\"MyFile\" fileName=\"logs/app-log-file.log\"> <NewRelicLayout/> </File> Copy If you're using a properties file, only change the layout.type: appender.console.type = Console appender.console.name = STDOUT appender.console.layout.type = NewRelicLayout Copy If you only modified an existing appender, skip this step. If you added a new appender, add <AppenderRef/> within <Root> to use this appender. Use the ref attribute to refer to appender name you created in the previous step. For example: <Root level=\"info\"> <AppenderRef ref=\"MyFile\"/> </Root> Copy If you're using a properties file and added a new appender, add: rootLogger.level = info rootLogger.appenderRef.stdout.ref = STDOUT ​​​​​ Copy Logback version 1.2.0 or higher We offer a Logback extension for logs in context with the Java agent. To get started, review the code and an example application on GitHub. To configure logs in context for your Java app with Logback: Make sure you have Logback version 1.2.0 or higher and the New Relic Java agent version 5.6.0 or higher installed and working on your application. Make sure you have the New Relic Java agent version 5.6.0 or higher installed on your application, and that you have enabled the JVM argument -javaagent. Update your project's dependencies to include the Logback extension as applicable: Gradle: Add the highlighted section to your build.gradle file: dependencies { implementation(\"com.newrelic.logging:logback:2.0\") } Copy Maven: Add the highlighted section to your pom.xml file: <dependencies> <dependency> <groupId>com.newrelic.logging</groupId> <artifactId>logback</artifactId> <version>2.0</version> </dependency> </dependencies> Copy Update your logging configuration xml to replace any existing <encoder> element. If you're logging to the console (stdout/stderr), look for ConsoleAppender and replace: <appender name=\"STDOUT\" class=\"ch.qos.logback.core.ConsoleAppender\"> <encoder class=\"com.newrelic.logging.logback.NewRelicEncoder\"/> </appender> Copy If you're logging to a file, look for FileAppender and replace <encoder>: <appender name=\"LOG_FILE\" class=\"ch.qos.logback.core.FileAppender\"> <file>logs/app-log-file.log</file> <encoder class=\"com.newrelic.logging.logback.NewRelicEncoder\"/> </appender> Copy Update your logging configuration xml with the NewRelicAsyncAppender. To ensure that NewRelicAsyncAppender wraps any appenders that will target New Relic's log forwarder, add the following section. Change \"LOG_FILE\" to the name of the appender you updated in the previous step. <appender name=\"ASYNC\" class=\"com.newrelic.logging.logback.NewRelicAsyncAppender\"> <appender-ref ref=\"LOG_FILE\" /> </appender> Copy Make sure NewRelicAsyncAppender is the first appender used in your logger. Replace your root logger’s appenders with the ASYNC appender created in the previous step. Then list any other appenders after the NewRelicAsyncAppender in the <root> list. <root> <appender-ref ref=\"ASYNC\" /> </root> Copy Here are examples of an updated logging .xml file for the Logback extension. You can also see a working example in GitHub. Single console appender example Example configuration file after adding in the logging extension information: <configuration> <appender name=\"STDOUT\" class=\"ch.qos.logback.core.ConsoleAppender\"> <!-- changed the encoder --> <encoder class=\"com.newrelic.logging.logback.NewRelicEncoder\"/> </appender> <!-- added the ASYNC appender --> <appender name=\"ASYNC\" class=\"com.newrelic.logging.logback.NewRelicAsyncAppender\"> <appender-ref ref=\"STDOUT\" /> </appender> <root level=\"debug\"> <!-- changed the root logger --> <appender-ref ref=\"ASYNC\" /> </root> </configuration> Copy Two console appenders example This example sends New Relic logging to a file, but still sends standard logging to the console: <configuration> <appender name=\"FILE\" class=\"ch.qos.logback.core.FileAppender\"> <file>myApp.log</file> <!-- encoder changed --> <encoder class=\"com.newrelic.logging.logback.NewRelicEncoder\"/> </appender> <!-- this appender does normal console logging --> <appender name=\"STDOUT\" class=\"ch.qos.logback.core.ConsoleAppender\"> <encoder> <pattern>%msg%n</pattern> </encoder> </appender> <!-- The required New Relic ASYNC appender wraps the FILE appender --> <appender name=\"ASYNC\" class=\"com.newrelic.logging.logback.NewRelicAsyncAppender\"> <appender-ref ref=\"FILE\" /> </appender> <root level=\"debug\"> <!-- ASYNC is one of the main appenders --> <appender-ref ref=\"ASYNC\" /> <!-- Send every message to normal console logging, as well. --> <appender-ref ref=\"STDOUT\" /> </root> </configuration> Copy Spring and Springboot We offer extensions for current versions of Spring and Spring Boot. If you already know the logging library, you can skip directly to that documentation: java.util.logging log4j 1 log4j 2 logback The extensions support default configurations only on Spring Boot 2.0 and higher. With Spring Boot: Here are tips to determine which logging library you have: If you have spring-boot-starter-log4j2 in your dependencies, you're using log4j 2.x. Refer to the Spring Boot log4j 2.x documentation for basic configuration, and the New Relic log4j 2 extension for customizing your configuration. If you're using Spring Boot but not the starter-log4j2, you're using logback by default. Refer to Spring Boot logback documentation for basic configuration, and the New Relic logback extension for customizing your configuration. With Spring (but not Spring Boot): Spring 5 or higher: Spring implements a bridge to other logging libraries that will automatically find them. However, those individual libraries must be configured and explicitly included in your project dependencies. To identify your logging dependency, consult your Gradle, Maven, or other build tool's dependency tree. Then follow the procedures to configure logs in context for your Java app with that extension. Spring 4 or lower: Spring version 4 and lower uses Apache Commons Logging for its bridge. Refer to the Spring documentation for information on configuring its bridge. View logs in UI To verify that you have configured the log appender correctly, run your application, then check your logs data in New Relic One using the query operator has:span.id has:trace.id. If everything is configured correctly and your data is being forwarded to New Relic with the enriched metadata, your logs should now be emitted as JSON and contain trace.id and span.id fields. If you don't see log data in the UI, follow the troubleshooting procedures. What's next? After you set up APM logs in context, make the most of your logging data: Explore the logging data across your platform with our Logs UI. See your logs in context of your app's performance in the APM UI. Troubleshoot errors with distributed tracing, stack traces, application logs, and more. Get deeper visibility into both your application and your platform performance data by forwarding your logs with our infrastructure monitoring agent. Review your infrastructure logs in the UI.

      "body": "If your log data is already being monitored by Fluent Bit, you can use our Fluent Bit output plugin to forward and enrich your log data in New Relic. Forwarding your Fluent Bit logs to New Relic will give you enhanced log management capabilities to collect, process, explore, query, and alert on your log data. Basic process We have published a container with the plugin installed. It serves as a base image to be used by our Kubernetes integration. We recommend you use this base image and layer your own custom configuration files. To forward your logs from Fluent Bit to New Relic: Make sure you have: A New Relic license key Fluent Bit 1.0 or higher (recommended), although v0.12 or higher is supported Fluent Bit Windows install directions can be found here Fluent Bit Linux install directions can be found here Install the Fluent Bit plugin. Configure the Fluent Bit plugin. Test the Fluent Bit plugin. Generate some traffic and wait a few minutes, then check your account for data. Install the Fluent Bit plugin To install the Fluent Bit plugin: Navigate to New Relic's Fluent Bit plugin repository on GitHub. From the repository page, clone or download the repository. Run the following command to build your plugin: cd newrelic-fluent-bit-output && make all Copy Store out_newrelic.so or out_newrelic_winXX.dll at a location that can be accessed by the fluent-bit daemon. Tip If you'd rather not compile the plugin yourself, you can download pre-compiled versions from our GitHub repository's releases page. Configure the Fluent Bit plugin Fluent Bit needs to know the location of the New Relic plugin and the New Relic license key to output data to New Relic. To configure your Fluent Bit plugin: Important Pay attention to white space when editing your config files. Be sure to use four spaces to indent and one space between keys and values. Locate or create a plugins.conf file in your plugins directory. In the plugins.conf file, add a reference to out_newrelic.so, adjacent to your fluent-bit.conf file: [PLUGINS] Path /PATH/TO/newrelic-fluent-bit-output/out_newrelic.so Copy In the fluent-bit.conf file, add the following line under the service block: [SERVICE] # This is the main configuration block for fluent bit. # Ensure the follow line exists somewhere in the SERVICE block Plugins_File plugins.conf Copy At the bottom of the fluent-bit.conf file, add the following to set up the input and output filters. Replace the placeholder text with your New Relic license key: [INPUT] Name tail Path /PATH/TO/YOUR/LOG/FILE [OUTPUT] Name newrelic Match * licenseKey YOUR_LICENSE_KEY # Optional maxBufferSize 256000 maxRecords 1024 Copy Restart your Fluent Bit instance with the following command: fluent-bit -c /PATH/TO/fluent-bit.conf Copy Test the Fluent Bit plugin To test if your Fluent Bit plugin is receiving input from a log file: Run the following command to append a test log message to your log file: echo \"test message\" >> /PATH/TO/YOUR/LOG/FILE Copy Search the New Relic Logs UI for test message. Associate logs with entities To associate a log line with an entity, such as an infrastructure host, add a FILTER block: [FILTER] Name modify Match * # Or specify a match Add entity.guids <Your Entity GUID ID> # Optional Add hostname <Your hostname> # Optional Copy For more options, see the Fluent Bit modify filter documentation and our documentation to forward your logs using the infrastructure agent. Optional: Configure plugin attributes Once you have installed and configured the Fluent Bit plugin, you can use the following attributes to configure how the plugin sends data to New Relic: Key Description licenseKey The New Relic license key. Use either licenseKey (recommended) or apiKey, not both. Default: none maxBufferSize The maximum size the payloads sent, in bytes. Default: 256000 maxRecords The maximum number of records to send at a time. Default: 1024 apiKey Deprecated. Takes a New Relic Insights insert key, but using the licenseKey attribute is preferred. Use either licenseKey or apiKey, not both. View log data If everything is configured correctly and your data is being collected, you should see data logs in both of these places: New Relic Logs UI New Relic tools for running NRQL queries. For example, you can execute a query like this: SELECT * FROM Log Copy If no data appears after you enable our log management capabilities, follow our standard log troubleshooting procedures.

      "body": "All of our sprint work is tracked in Jira. The workflow depends on what type of work we're dealing with: Planned or unplanned (\"surprise!\") work. Planned work Planned work includes all work that is currently in our backlog or has been added to the current sprint as a result of a Sprint Planning session. This could include writing or updating documentation, research, meeting with SMEs, information architecture, incorporating peer edits, SME review, and so on. Unplanned work (surprises!) Usually, we get notified of major requests far enough in advance that we can include them in liaison project plans, backlog grooming, and sprint planning. Occasionally, something bigger surprises us that needs emergency support. Follow this process with new docs asks to assess the scope of work and ensure we address valid docs needs within a reasonable amount of time. Our goal is to treat the sprint as sacred and insulate against \"surprise\" work that is not absolutely crucial. But we also want to ensure we're providing good internal customer service, and not getting hung up on process niceties for things that are small. Jira boards: Backlog and future sprints This is where the vast majority of tickets spend their time. Most tickets (even for active projects) spend at least a little time here before moving into a sprint to be actively worked. Being in the backlog doesn't mean something isn't important---just that we haven't committed to it yet.  You can also add tickets straight to a future sprint. This is where tickets tentatively assigned to a future sprint will be found. Tickets can be assigned here to be held for backlog grooming and sprint planning.  Jira boards: Current sprint Proposed This step is for work that has been assigned to the current sprint during Sprint Planning and is available to be picked up by a tech writer. When you're ready to take on a new ticket, try to work the queue from the top-down and avoid cherry picking. It's also better to pick up Needs Peer Edit tickets before committing to a new ticket. Something that needs a peer edit is close to done, and helping things across the finish line helps get value into users hands, and frees us up to think about new problems. In Progress This step is for all of the work to be done by the assignee: Research, meeting with SMEs, information architecture, writing, incorporating peer edits, SME review, and so on. Tickets are moved to this step once work is started by the TW, and remain here until the work is either complete, ready for peer review, or it becomes blocked. If additional large edits are needed after the peer review, the ticket can be moved back to In Progress for those edits. Needs Peer Editor Work that is ready for a peer edit. Once a peer editor picks it up, they move it into In Peer Edit. In Peer Edit This step is for a peer editor to review docs before they go live. Follow the Peer editor workflow, then move the ticket into Peer Edit Done.  Peer Edit Done This step is a holding state once peer editing is complete. After completing their peer edit and delivering their feedback, the peer editor moves the ticket into Peer Edit Done. From there, the assignee on the ticket (not the peer editor) moves the ticket into the appropriate column (In Progress, Blocked, or Closed). Minor edits can be completed from this column but for major doc rework, the ticket should be moved back into the In Progress column. Blocked This step is for tickets that cannot be moved forward by the team. This could be because we're waiting for a response from a SME, or for a feature to deploy, or for final signoff. The team keeps an eye on this column for tickets that may need escalation. Putting something in Blocked rather than In Progress lets us see the status of every ticket at a glance. This column can also be used for extended time out of the office for the assigned writer, if it's work that can be safely held. (If the work cannot be held while you're out, find another writer to step in and take over.) Once you're un-blocked, move the ticket to the appropriate column. If the ticket remains blocked at the end of the current sprint, it will need to be re-reviewed during backlog grooming to determine if the ticket will carry-over into the upcoming sprint, or return to the backlog until a future sprint. Done This step is for work that is 100% finished. Work gets cleared out this column before we start a new sprint. Incomplete (\"carry-over\") tickets Ticket don't carry over automatically between sprints. Instead, any ticket that gets carried over is treated as a \"new\" ticket in the next sprint planning. Before sprint planning, review any open tickets in the board that are assigned to you and figure out what to do with them. For each open ticket assigned to you (or \"carry over\"), decide if you should: Recommended: Clone the ticket and close the old one. This is the best option for partially completed work because it makes metrics easier. If you do: Clone the ticket. Note why we closed the ticket. Add an estimate of points completed in the Points Completed field. Create a follow-up ticket if necessary. Move the ticket to the next sprint. If you do: Review the ticket's action items and description to make sure they're still current. Clear out the ticket points. Move the ticket back to the backlog. If you do: Update the action items and description to make sure they're still current. Note why we moved to the backlog rather than carry over. ← Planning poker Liaisonships → Tip We welcome thoughts or questions on our handbook!

But in other situations where you don't have log forwarders (such as CDNs, hardware devices, or managed services), you can use syslog protocols via a TCP endpoint. You can forward your logs to New Relic using syslog clients such as rsyslog and syslog-ng. Compatibility and requirements To forward logs to New Relic using a syslog client, you need: A valid New Relic license key for the account you want to send logs to Some minor changes to the syslog client's configuration, as explained in this document Configure rsyslog To forward logs to New Relic with rsyslog: Install packages required to allow rsyslog to send logs using TLS encryption: sudo yum install rsyslog-gnutls ca-certificates Copy Optional: Configure rsyslog to tail log files and forward their contents to New Relic.

Legacy config file for rsyslog 7 or earlier If you are using rsyslog version 7 or below, the configuration files need to be adapted to the obsolete legacy format. This format is only kept for retro compatibility purposes. We strongly recommend to avoid using it, as stated in the rsyslog documentation. Install packages required to allow rsyslog to send logs using TLS encryption: sudo yum install rsyslog-gnutls ca-certificates Copy Optional: Configure rsyslog to tail log files and forward their contents to New Relic. Add the following to the /etc/rsyslog.conf file in order to enable its text file input module: $ModLoad imfile $InputFilePollInterval 10 $PrivDropToGroup adm $WorkDirectory /var/spool/rsyslog Copy In the /etc/rsyslog.d/ directory, create a text file named newrelic.conf. Explicitly include the newly created newrelic.conf to the /etc/rsyslog.d/ file: $IncludeConfig /etc/rsyslog.conf.d/newrelic.conf Copy Add the following to newrelic.conf, replacing `YOUR_LICENSE_KEY with your New Relic license key: ## Template expected by the New Relic Syslog endpoint $template NRLogFormat,\"YOUR_LICENSE_KEY <%pri%>%protocol-version% %timestamp:::date-rfc3339% %hostname% %app-name% %procid% %msgid% %structured-data% %msg%\\n\" ## Specify each of the files to be tailed in case step 1 is done $InputFileName /path/to/file $InputFileTag <YOUR_FILE_TAG> $InputFileStateFile <UNIQUE_STATEFILE_NAME> $InputFileSeverity info $InputRunFileMonitor ## Configure TLS and log forwarding $DefaultNetstreamDriverCAFile /etc/ssl/certs/ca-certificates.crt $ActionSendStreamDriver gtls $ActionSendStreamDriverMode 1 $ActionSendStreamDriverAuthMode x509/name $ActionSendStreamDriverPermittedPeer *.syslog.nr-data.net *.* @@newrelic.syslog.nr-data.net:6514;NRLogFormat Copy Restart the rsyslog service by running: sudo systemctl restart rsyslog Copy Check your New Relic account for logs. Configure syslog-ng To forward logs to New Relic with syslog-ng: Install ca-certificates required to allow syslog-ng to send logs using TLS encryption: sudo yum install ca-certificates Copy Open the syslog-ng configuration file (/etc/syslog-ng/syslog-ng.conf) in a text editor. Define the sources to be monitored by adding: source s_src { internal(); }; Copy Optional: Configure syslog-ng to tail files by adding the following to the Sources configuration block: source s_files { file(\"<PATH_TO_FILE>\"); }; Copy Define the New Relic syslog format and add your New Relic license key: template NRFormat { template(\"YOUR_LICENSE_KEY <${PRI}>1 ${ISODATE} ${HOST:--} ${PROGRAM:--} ${PID:--} ${MSGID:--} ${SDATA:--} $MSG\\n\"); template_escape(no); }; Copy Add the New Relic Syslog endpoint: destination d_newrelic { network(\"newrelic.syslog.nr-data.net\" port(6514) transport(\"tls\") tls(peer-verify(no)) template(NRFormat) ); }; Copy Add the following output to the log path configuration block: log { source(s_src); source(s_files); ## in case step 4 is implemented. destination(d_newrelic); }; Copy Restart syslog-ng by running: sudo service syslog-ng restart Copy Check your New Relic account for logs.

To troubleshoot GitHub issues, see our guide. Peer editing workflow in GitHub If you’re peer editing a doc or have been otherwise assigned to a PR as a reviewer, you have a few choices for how and where to do the work. The most streamlined and open-source approach is to do the edit using GitHub options, rather than copying the file to Google Docs and editing there. Developmental edit pass For cases where you have questions and suggestions rather than straight copy edits, follow these steps. Open the PR that you’re assigned to review. On the Files changed tab, you can either: Click Review changes and then select one of the following: Comment - use if you have a comment that doesn’t require follow up. Approve - use if you just want to approve the PR. You can request changes in the Leave a comment area, and select Approve if you want to let the writer make the edits and merge the file without a follow-up review from you. Request changes - use for times when you want to make sure the changes you request are included. You’ll be notified with any updates that the writer makes. OR, start making comments on lines or sections of the doc. To do this, click the add comment icon , and leave an edit or comment for that specific line in the page. With this option, you get the choice between adding a single comment or starting a review. If you’re going to make comments throughout a doc, choose Start a review so the comments will all be rolled into one commit. Click Finish your review to complete your review. This triggers a notification to the writer alerting them that you’ve made suggestions. Copy edit workflow If you have copy edits for a file rather than comments and suggestions, you can make the changes to the file in different ways. Here are two main options: Edit using the GitHub browser: On the Files changed tab, in the diff window click the editing button (three dots). When you finish your edits, add a comment at the bottom of the file and choose to either commit the changes directly, or create a branch and start a pull request. Choose to branch and start a pull request if you expect a writer to review the diff and accept or revise your edits. Edit locally: Check out the branch containing the file you want to edit. In GitHub Desktop, click the Current branch down arrow and select the branch. Then, make the edits on your local drive, save, and commit your changes to the branch. Note that this approach adds your edits to the open pull request. You can now see the changes you added to the file on the Files changed tab in the PR. These are just a few of many editing options. You’ll find your preferred way, just as with any other tool.",

      "body": "As tech doc writers (TW) we edit docs, do peer edits, or use the Docs Team GitHub board to track the status of issues and pull requests (PR). Who is who in an issue/PR? GitHub keeps track of all activity concerning an issue or PR, including, of course, the people involved. When a new issue or PR is filed, check on the filer’s username and see if they're listed as a member of the New Relic organization. If they aren't, try to find them on Slack based on their username. If you're not sure about someone's affiliation, treat them as external until you know otherwise. People in an issue/PR include: Creator: The person who opened the issue or PR. This could be a writer, a Relic, or an external user. We'll label the issue or PR differently depending on who created it. If you're not sure if a user is a Relic, a good trick is to click on their profile and see if they're a member of the New Relic GitHub org. Assignee: The person taking responsibility for a PR or issue. This will usually be used by the Hero or Sidekick to assign non-TW PRs and issues to themselves. It can also be used to take a TW’s PR or issue over from them. Reviewer: The person who reviews or peer edits the code/document and approves the changes. Not necessarily the person responsible for that area or responsible for merging the commit. You can pre-assign up to 100 reviewers to a given issue. Track issues in the board The docs board has the following columns: Column Description Needs triage The Hero or Sidekick review and label issues and PRs in this column, then drag them to the appropriate column. If a PR or issue is labeled eng, the Hero/Sidekick can go ahead and click its ellipses icon to archive it. Hero: to do PRs that the Hero needs to review, publish, and follow up with SMEs as needed. Hero: Assign yourself as Assignee. In review (Hero or any TW) Drag PRs to this column when they are being reviewed. This shows who is reviewing and what is being reviewed, so two writers don’t mistakenly work on the same PR. Any TW: Writer needs PR review PRs from Tech Docs team members that need a light edit pass to make sure everything in GitHub is correct. This should be checked by other writers every few hours so PRs don’t get stale. If you have a PR that’s been lingering here too long, ask for a reviewer in #doc_sprint_talk. Whoever takes it: assign yourself as Reviewer. Any TW: needs peer edit Like our Needs Peer Edit column in Jira: A writer has requested a review of their PR. Review their PR in GitHub and leave comments. Whoever takes it: assign yourself as Reviewer. Waiting on SME/Blocked For PRs that are blocked by need for SME info or confirmation (for example, as Hero you are waiting on an answer from the person who sent in a Hero pull request). Waiting on TW to merge All reviews are complete. The TW who created the PR (or who is assigned the issue) needs to merge this work into develop. Drafts A draft is a way to open a PR while indicating that the work is still in progress and not necessarily ready to merge immediately. You can't merge a Draft PR directly. Instead, you must move it out of draft status first. When you see a draft PR (especially from outside the team!), treat it as though it's a working draft, and reach out to the creator to discuss. Read more on GitHub's drafts. As a Hero, make sure you attend to the following throughout your day: Check in with the previous Hero at the start of your day (especially on Monday at the start of the week). Don’t forget to sync with the BCN Hero if necessary. Watch for incoming PRs in #docs_deploys, and review everything in the Needs triage column. Drag cards from that column to the appropriate column. Work through the cards in the Hero: to do column. Everyone on the team helps keep things moving: All writers should keep an eye on both Any TW columns. There's one column for PRs that need a simpler review before merging (typo fixes, drive-by edits, etc), and another column for PRs that need a peer edit. There are also two blocked columns: One for PRs blocked on a SME, and another column where we're waiting on the TW who created the PR to review feedback and/or merge. After merging, remove your ticket from the board. Deal with references in GitHub (and the style guide) Don't link to anything non-public from a public place. You can reference Jira tickets, but reference tickets by issue key (DOC-1234 is ok) rather than a link (https://newrelic.atlassian.net/browse/DOC-1234 is not). Don't mention traffic or usage numbers publicly. Don't reference internal people by name. If they have a GH account, @mention their GH handle. If they don't, talk instead about teams (\"talk to a browser team engineer\" or \"Support Engineer\") rather than people. You can mention the #documentation channel and hero. Merge releases into main work (or, when do we publish?) The Hero currently merges three times a day: At 9 AM (morning), 12 PM (noon), and 3 PM (evening) Pacific. We merge release branches into main to avoid interuptions when someone merges into develop during a release. To learn more about this workflow, see the gitflow documentation in Atlassian. To start a release: Create a branch based off develop Github Desktop by clicking Current Branch in the top header, clicking New Branch in the dropdown, and then selecting Develop. Name the branch following this pattern: daily-release/mm-dd-yy-morning/noon/evening. Here's an example: daily-release/10-27-21-morning. Push your changes by clicking Push Origin in GitHub Desktop. Create a pull request into main from your new daily release branch by clicking Create Pull Request. This will open a pull request screen on github.com. Pull requests default to merging into develop, so select main as the base branch in the left side of the page and then click Submit Pull Request. Wait until all the checks complete, and then merge the pull request. All branches that follow the daily-release/mm-dd-yy-morning pattern are protected branches. This means the branches can't be deleted or pushed to by non-admins. GitHub labels Every issue needs labels to help us triage and track the health of our backlog: content: Always add, this indicates the issue is content-related rather than a design or engineering issue. pg_*: Always add to indicate the product group. For full definitions, see the \"Doc Jira and GitHub fields\" doc in the internal team Google Drive. Indicate who created the issue: from_internal: A Relic created it. from_external: A user opened it in the repo OR it came in through #customer-feedback process. from_tw: One of us created it (unless we were passing along #customer-feedback). Optionally: docs-issues-migrate: Issues that are too large in scope for the docs team to handle without product team expertise. This label alerts the docs issues team to migrate these issues into the customer feedback channel where they will be triaged and sent to product teams. Jira’d: Issues that have a corresponding Jira ticket. Make sure you leave the Jira number in the comments of the issue (for example, DOC-1234). Every pull request needs these labels so we can see where our contributions come from: content: Always add, this indicates the PR is content-related rather than design or engineering. Indicate who created the pull request: from_internal: A Relic created it. from_external: A user opened it in the repo OR it came in through #customer-feedback process. from_tw: One of us created it (unless we were passing along #customer-feedback). If the PR fixes an external issue, label it as from_tw since the work was done by a tech writer.",

      "body": "This doc explains required styles and recommended phrasings for user-related terminology on the New Relic One user model. Note about user models This style guide applies to the New Relic One user model, not the original user model. Even though both user models share certain terms (such as Admin), this is an entirely different user model with an entirely different structure, recommended phrasings, and style. To understand user model differences, see Overview of user models. The original user model will be increasingly deprecated, so we shouldn't need to think very much about that user model or update those docs very often. Styles and formatting Here are some user-related styles and formats for user-related language for the New Relic One user model: Category Example use Styles and tips User type (basic user vs. full platform user) Example use: If you’re a full platform user, you can... Lower case, with no style applied. We took this simple approach because the user type names are short names, easily understood without formatting or capitalization, and because this gives us the ability to refer to user types as plurals (e.g., \"your organization's basic users can...\") Note that it can sometimes be awkward when \"basic user\" is in front of a noun. For example: \"To learn about basic user capabilities...\" can sound like you're talking about user capabilities that are basic. To avoid this, rephrase to be more clear and/or link to the user type doc section from the use of \"basic user\" or \"full platform user.\" Roles Example use: This capability is available for the All product admin role. Preferred: sentence case, bold. Alternatively, instead of bold, you can use italics or code-formatting: as long as it's clear that we're referring to something that has a definite, exact name. When referencing roles, we recommend linking to the standard roles doc, which lists and defines the roles, and also explains how roles are related to the default groups (Admin and User). Default groups Example use: When adding a user, you can add them to either the default Admin or User groups, or a custom group if you have any. For docs site, use sentence case and bold. Alternatively, for non-docs-site styling, you can use italics or code-formatting: as long as it's clear that we're referring to something that has a definite, exact name. The words 'admin' and 'user' are generic, general words, so using formatting to indicate that we're referencing specific terms is important. When referencing the default groups, we recommend linking to the explanation of default groups. Capabilities Example use: The ability to do this is governed by the \"modify APM settings\" capability. One way to reference a capability is by using quotes as shown in the example here, but we don't have firm rules on how to reference capabilities. One reason for this is that capabilities don't have specific proper names and are more informal. To see what we mean, see the screenshot of the capabilities UI table. The rows in the capabilities table have a heading (like \"APM\"), and refer to a feature (like \"Application settings\"), and have columns referencing more granular abilities (like \"Create\" or \"Delete\"). For this reason, we don't have a firm rule but the goal is simply to try to make it clear which capability you're referencing. Philosophy for user permissions/roles language Before writing permission-related requirements for docs or similar use cases, you should read about the relationships between groups, roles, and capabilities. The following recommendations for permissions-related documentation philosophy applies primarly for documenting our New Relic One user model, not our original user model. Notes on documenting user type or group as requirements For documentation about New Relic features, we don't document restrictions related to user type (basic vs. full platform) or default groups. The only doc we explain what's available by user type is in the 'User type' documentation. Some reasoning about why that is: Basic vs. full platform users: The only place we document restrictions related to user type (basic vs. full) is in the primary 'User type' doc. This means that we don't need to put user type requirements in every doc about a feature. One reason for this is that basic users have explanations and upsell information in the UI, so this will mostly be self-evident. API docs exception: Because APIs are not as obvious and transparent as the New Relic UI, we should document any requirements that SMEs think are relevant, which may include user type. Attempt to put any requirements for using an API in a single location, and not spread them throughout the docs. Default user groups: We don't explain restrictions related to user groups (that is, our default groups Admin and User). This is because the actual mechanism causing the restriction is not due to the group, but to the role assigned to that group (and at a more granular level, due to the capabilities associated with that role). If you have questions about user type, user group, and user roles, see the User model doc. Document requirements for relevant role or capability When considered necessary, document any roles or capabilities that gate access to a feature. A few notes on this: Note that when creating a doc about a new feature, we don't document requirements related to user type or group. Note that our standard roles are just aggregations of capabilities. This means that there can be multiple standard roles that have some of same capabilities. In that case, in order to be more specific, you'd reference the capabilities, not the role. It is okay to use general, informal language when referencing capabilities, as is shown in the example below. Some standard roles (like Billing user and Organization manager and Authentication domain manager) have capabilities that aren't exposed in the UI to customers, so this means that in those cases we'd have to just reference the role and not a specific capability. Examples: Example of documenting roles Example of documenting capabilities. Document requirements for both original and new user model If you're including requirements about New Relic One user model roles or capabilities, you may also need to include details about the original user model. Here's an example of how to do that. Permissions requirements differ depending on your user model: * For users on the [original user model](/docs/accounts/original-accounts-billing/original-product-based-pricing/overview-changes-pricing-user-model/#user-models): the [**Data retention manager** role](/docs/accounts/original-accounts-billing/original-users-roles/users-roles-original-user-model/#roles). * For users on the [New Relic One user model](/docs/accounts/original-accounts-billing/original-product-based-pricing/overview-changes-pricing-user-model/#user-models): the [**Billing user** role](com/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/new-relic-one-user-management/new-relic-one-user-model-understand-user-structure/#standard-roles).

      "body": "For users on our original user model, an introduction to how the user model works, including user roles and permissions, and how to add and manage users. Requirements This doc and the surrounding section of docs shows you how to manage users on our original user model. If you were a New Relic customer before July 30 2020 and haven't migrated your users to the new model, your users are on our original user model (and not the New Relic One model). If you're an admin and want to see if you have users on the original model: If you can see users in the Users and roles UI, those users are on our original user model. Updates about our new user model In July of 2020, we released a new user model called the New Relic One user model, which offers many benefits in terms of how you manage your organization and users. At first this was only available to new sign-ups but over time we've been migrating more older customers to the new model. Some older customers are able to migrate their users on their own. We'll continue working on migrating users to the new model until the original model is fully deprecated. One impact of the new user model is that it's possible now for users to have multiple logins associated with the same email. For example, a user with access to multiple organizations (like a contractor) may have their user record updated to the new user model in one organization, resulting in them having their original login method and records and a New Relic One user model record. This may result in the user being logged in to New Relic and not being able to find an account they're looking for. For more on that, see Factors affecting access. If a user's email is associated with more than one login, they'll see a \"multiple accounts found\" note when logging in. View and manage users in UI If your New Relic account has users on our original user model, you can use the Users and roles UI. To access this: Click the account dropdown, click Account settings, and then click Users and roles. Some features in the UI are visible only to account Owners and Admins. Tip You can also use the New Relic REST API to obtain a list of everyone and their roles in your New Relic account. Here are some instructions and tips for adding and managing users via the UI: Add a new user Tip Owner or Admins To add a new user to your New Relic account: Go to: account dropdown > Account settings > Users and roles > Users. In the upper right corner, click New user. Enter the appropriate name and email address. Select their base role as either Admin, User, or Restricted. Select Add user. The new user will receive an email notification automatically from New Relic. Important New Relic recommends a maximum of 1,000 accounts per user. Additional accounts may result in limited access to some New Relic features. Manage user type (basic vs full) and full platform user upgrades Note that billing-related aspects of your count of full platform users only apply if you're on New Relic One pricing. If you're on our original pricing model, billing impacts do not apply. To update a user's type (basic user versus full platform user): Go to: account dropdown > Account settings > Users and roles > Users. Either select a user and edit their type or bulk update the type for multiple users. To control how basic users upgrade to become full platform users, from the Users and roles UI you can select Access requests. You have two options: Automatic approval: With this option, basic users can automatically upgrade to be full platform users. This option allows your users to more easily troubleshoot problems. Require review: With this option, your admins get a notification when basic users request an upgrade and must upgrade them first. You can approve them either from the notification email or from the user's entry in the Users and roles UI. For more about user type, see User type. Determine full platform user count If you're on New Relic One pricing model, your count of full platform users is a factor in your billing. To see your count of full platform users, click the account dropdown and then click View your usage. If you have a parent/child account structure (including a customer partnership), your count of full platform users may not match what you see when you go to Account settings > Users and roles. To examine users on a parent account's children accounts, go to a parent account's Account settings UI page, click on a child account, and go to that account's Users and roles UI page. Enable SAML SSO and/or SCIM For an introduction to using SAML SSO and/or SCIM provisioning, see Get started with SAML SSO or SCIM. View pending SAML SSO users New Relic accounts with SAML Single Sign On (SSO) may have a list of Pending users. These are individuals who have been added to the SAML-enabled account but have not yet confirmed. Update account roles Tip Owner or Admins To update a person's role and capabilities: Go to: account dropdown > Account settings > Users and roles > Users. Select the person's name. Under Roles and capabilities, select their base role as Admin, User, or Restricted. The account Owner must update the Owner role. Delete a user Tip Owner or Admins To remove a user from your New Relic account: Go to: account dropdown > Account settings > Users and roles > Users. Click on the name of the person you would like to update. Click Delete User. Tip You can also add, update, or delete users in bulk via CSV file. Update the account Owner A New Relic account can have only one Owner role at any time. You must be the current account Owner to change your role to someone who currently has an Admin role for the account. If the current Owner is unavailable, contact your account representative at New Relic, or get support at support.newrelic.com. You cannot delete or remove your assigned Owner role. However, if the account has one or more Admin role, you can change an Owner to an Admin. Go to: account dropdown > Account settings > Account > Users and roles. Above the Active users list, select Change owner. If an account has no Admins, this button won't be available. Select someone who currently has an Admin role for the account. Refresh the page for changes to take effect. Your previous Owner role automatically changes to an Admin role. To find out who is the current assigned Owner: Go to: account dropdown > Account settings > Account > Users and roles. View the Base role column to locate your account Owner. The Change owner button is only visible to the current account Owner. If the current Owner is unable to change the role (for example, that person no longer is with your organization), contact your account representative at New Relic, or get support at support.newrelic.com. User types: basic user and full platform user This section is for users on our original user model. If you're on our New Relic One user model, see our New Relic One user docs. The user type (basic user or full platform user) determines what features a user has access to. Below are details on the two user types. Note that billing-related aspects only apply if you're on New Relic One pricing. If you're on our original pricing model, billing impacts do not apply. Basic user. Details: These users have access to basic features like setting up reporting of data, running queries of data, making custom charts and dashboards, and setting up alerts. They do not have access to our more curated observability UI experiences (for more details on feature access, see Capabilities). Depending on access request settings, basic users can either upgrade themselves to be full platform users or request upgrade access from admins. Full platform user (also called full user). Details: Full platform users have access to everything (dependent on role restrictions), which includes our curated observability UI experiences, such as APM, infrastructure monitoring, browser monitoring, mobile monitoring, and synthetic monitors. For details, see Capabilities. For organizations on New Relic One pricing: these users are billable. The Standard edition includes one free full platform user and up to five total. If a user in your organization is set as a basic user in one account and a full platform user in another, the user is considered a full platform user and has full platform user access on all accounts in that organization. For how to edit a user's type, see Manage users. Account roles A New Relic account can have only one Owner. To share an account with other users in your organization, create Admins, Users, or Restricted Users. Account role Description Owner The person who initially creates the New Relic account and receives all billing queries. The Owner has complete access to all of the account information. Admin Can add, edit, and delete users, and can enable or set up features. User Can use (and optionally set up) New Relic features. In general, Admins take responsibility for setting up features, and Users and Restricted Users can use them. Restricted User One or more individuals who can view (but not set up or change) any New Relic features. The Restricted User role is useful, for example, for demos. You can change your New Relic session settings so that Restricted User logins do not time out, and then set the user interface to Kiosk mode. Add-on roles With add-on roles, you can grant variable levels of access to all users in your account, across the entire platform of New Relic products. This allows you to tailor your account permissions levels to suit the needs of Users and Restricted Users within your account. Giving a User or Restricted User add-on manager access to a product grants them the equivalent of Admin capabilities within the product. They will continue to have User or Restricted User capabilities for all other New Relic products. For example, you could make a software engineer in your company a User in most products, but assign Admin-level access to APM. For another example, you might assign the Nerdpack manager role to a user, and that gives them the ability to subscribe and unsubscribe New Relic One applications to an account. There are two types of add-on roles: Add-on Manager roles are available to grant permissions on a per-product basis. Giving a User or Restricted User managed add-on access to a product grants them the equivalent of Admin capabilities within the product. Custom add-on roles can grant feature-specific permissions across different New Relic products. For example, a group of Users could have the ability to acknowledge incidents and close violations in New Relic Alerts, but not have the ability to modify your existing alert preferences. Individuals on a parent account automatically have the same level of access for all the child accounts of the parent account. Below are options for managing both managed add-on roles and custom add-on roles: View roles To view the list of individuals assigned to your account and their current roles: Go to account dropdown > Account settings > Users and roles. Assign a managed role Tip Owner and Admins Managed add-on roles are available by default for each New Relic product. Adding a managed role for a user grants them Admin-level permissions for the assigned product. They cannot be edited or deleted. To assign a managed add-on role for a User or Restricted User in your account: Go to account dropdown > Account settings > Users and roles. From the list of users associated with your account, select their name. Under Add-on roles, select the type of manager role for the user. To understand which capabilities may be added, use the Capabilities preview chart. Features in the Capabilities preview chart may not exactly match what features are available for your subscription level. Tip You can also add, update, or delete users in bulk by using a CSV file. Create a custom role To create a custom add-on role for your account: Go to account dropdown > Account settings > Users and roles > Roles. Select New custom add-on role. Select the capabilities necessary for the new custom role, then Create role. Assign a custom role Tip Owners and Admins You must create a custom role before assigning it to a user. To assign a custom add-on role for a User or Restricted User in your account: Go to account dropdown > Account settings > Users and roles > Users. From the list of users associated with your account, select their name ]. Under Add-on roles, select a custom role for the user. Click Update user. Edit or delete a custom role Tip Owners and Admins You cannot edit or delete New Relic's default roles. However, you can edit or delete custom add-on roles for your account: Go to account dropdown > Account settings > Users and roles > Roles. From the Add-on roles list, select the custom add-on role, then select Edit role or Delete role as appropriate. Account permissions Here is a summary of user permissions. Individuals on a parent account automatically have the same level of access for all the child accounts of that parent account. However, they won't receive email notifications for alerts or weekly reports for child accounts unless they are explicitly granted permission on those accounts. Function Owner Admin User Restricted Maintain billing information. Change the account Owner. Add, update, and delete account Admins, Users, and Restricted Users. When the account Owner and Admins add individuals to the account, New Relic automatically sends them an email message. Update users' job titles and roles from Account settings in the New Relic UI. Create, modify and delete child accounts from Account settings in the New Relic UI. Update your own account information (name, password change or password reset request, default account, email preferences, etc.) from User preferences in the New Relic UI. Change someone else's password. You cannot reset passwords for anyone else on the account, even if you are an Owner or Admin. Instead, follow standard procedures to request a password reset from New Relic. View the list of individuals on the account from (account dropdown) > Account settings > Account > Summary in the New Relic UI. Manage flexible data retention. Subscribe and unsubscribe applications to New Relic One Add, update, and delete Proactive Detection configurations. Alert permissions Here is a summary of Admin and Add-on manager capabilities with New Relic Alerts. To allow a User or Restricted User to execute any of these functions in New Relic Alerts, assign an Alerts add-on manager role. Admin and manager capabilities for Alerts include: Create or name alert policies. Specify incident preferences. Disable or define alert conditions. Provide runbook instructions. Select product targets. Alter alert condition thresholds. Create, modify, or delete notification channels. APM permissions Here is a summary of Admin and Add-on manager capabilities with APM. To allow a User or Restricted User to execute any of these functions in APM, assign an APM add-on manager role. Admin and manager capabilities for APM include: Remove applications from the New Relic UI. Delete app traces and error traces. Browser permissions Here is a summary of Admin and Add-on manager capabilities with New Relic Browser. To allow a User or Restricted User to execute any of these functions in New Relic Browser, assign a Browser add-on manager role. Admin and manager capabilities for Browser include: Add, rename, or delete applications. Manage whitelists. Manage domain conditions. Infrastructure permissions Here is a summary of Admin and Add-on manager capabilities with New Relic Infrastructure. To allow a User or Restricted User to execute any of these functions in New Relic Infrastructure, assign an Infrastructure manager role. Admin and manager capabilities for Infrastructure include: Create alert conditions in New Relic infrastructure, including conditions for host not reporting. Add or modify integrations. Insights permissions Here is a summary of Admin and Add-on manager capabilities with New Relic Insights. To allow a User or Restricted User to execute any of these functions, assign an Insights manager role. These functions include: Create, view, modify, or delete Query API keys or Insert API keys. Tip New Relic Insights includes permission levels to share your Insights dashboards with others. Mobile permissions To give permission to delete a mobile app from New Relic, you can assign an Admin or Mobile manager role. Synthetics permissions Here's a summary of Admin and Add-on manager capabilities with New Relic Synthetics. To allow a User or Restricted User to execute any of these functions in New Relic Synthetics, assign a Synthetics add-on manager role. Admin and manager capabilities for Synthetics include: Create, edit, or delete monitors. Edit monitor scripts. Create, edit, or delete private locations. Create, edit, or delete monitor downtimes. Create, view, edit, or delete secure credentials. For more information, see User roles in Synthetics. Workloads permissions Here's a summary of Admin and Add-on manager capabilities with New Relic One workloads: Create, duplicate, modify, or delete workloads. Link dashboards to workloads and save filters. To allow a User or Restricted User to execute these functions, assign the workloads manager add-on role. Bulk user management With the Bulk user actions feature, you can add, update, or delete multiple users at once. This can be helpful for: adding roles when multiple new employees start deleting roles when multiple employees leave giving multiple employees Admin roles Update users in bulk Some important rules and recommendations for making bulk user actions: You cannot make updates to your own role or an Owner role. You cannot edit an existing user's email address or name. You should avoid editing an existing user by deleting and re-adding them because this can have unintended consequences (for example, API keys associated with the original user will be lost). To add new user roles, update existing user roles, or delete user roles for users on the original user model: Go to: account dropdown > Account settings > Users and roles, and add /bulk_actions at the end of the URL. Example URL: https://account.newrelic.com/accounts/123456789/users/bulk_actions Copy Download a Backup CSV file. Downloading a backup file keeps a record of the users in your account prior to changes being made, and allows you to easily re-add any users that may be removed accidentally. Download a CSV of users or a CSV template. Each bulk action (add, update, or delete) will require its own CSV file. New Relic recommends saving your files with an account number, date, and the bulk action being performed. For example: account_123456789_delete_users_2018-06-29 Populate that sheet with only the users whose roles you'll be applying the chosen bulk action for. Remove users from the spreadsheet whose roles you do not want to change. Bulk action Fields Add Required fields: user email, name, type, base role Optional field: add-on role Update Required fields: user email (do not edit), name (do not edit), base role Optional field: add-on role Delete Required fields: only user email Example CSV file The following is an example downloaded CSV of users that lists four users on the New Relic account. In this example, we want to delete the user Alex Datanerd. All other users must be removed before uploading the CSV. Email Name Type Base role Add-on roles Last active User1 @Company.com Jane Datanerd full Owner 2/6/20 User2 @Company.com Jamie Datanerd full Admin 6/6/20 User3 @Company.com Alex Datanerd full User apm_admin, browser_admin 7/25/20 User4 @Company.com Pat Datanerd basic User alerts_admin, insights_admin, apm_admin 4/6/20 The other three users, whose roles will remain unchanged, are removed. The final CSV only shows Alex's name. This file would then be uploaded using the Delete users in CSV option in the UI. Email Name Type Base role Add-on roles Last active User3 @Company.com Alex Datanerd full User apm_admin, browser_admin In the UI, select a CSV action: Add, Update, or Delete the users listed within the CSV file. Upload the new CSV, and select Save changes. Bulk user management troubleshooting If a user is removed or changed during your CSV file upload by mistake, you can add them back through another CSV file upload. Important Be aware that associated permissions may be lost when a user is deleted and re-added. For example, associated API keys will need to be re-added. If you have a backup CSV file If you have a backup CSV file saved: Open the backup CSV file. Populate the backup CSV file with the users whose roles will be modified. Select a CSV action for the new CSV file: add, update, or delete Upload the new CSV, and select Save changes. If no backup file exists If no backup CSV file has been previously downloaded: Download the CSV file template. Populate the spreadsheet with the information required for the user to be restored. Action Required fields Add User email, name, type, base role. Optional: Add-on role Update User email, name, type, base role. Optional: Add-on role Delete User email Select a CSV action for the new CSV file: Add, Update, or Delete. Upload the new CSV, and select Save changes.",

      "body": "Use infrastructure monitoring's Host not reporting condition to notify you when we've stopped receiving data from an infrastructure agent. This feature allows you to dynamically alert on groups of hosts, configure the time window from five to 60 minutes, and take full advantage of alerts notifications. Features You can define conditions based on the sets of hosts most important to you, and configure thresholds appropriate for each filter set. The Host not reporting event triggers when data from the infrastructure agent doesn't reach our collector within the time frame you specify. Caution If you have filtered your Host Not Reporting condition using tags or labels and then remove a critical tag or label from a targeted host, the system will open a Host Not Reporting violation, since it will characterize that host as having lost its connection. This feature's flexibility allows you to easily customize what to monitor and when to notify selected individuals or teams. In addition, the email notification includes links to help you quickly troubleshoot the situation. Host not reporting condition Features What to monitor You can use filter sets to select which hosts you want to be monitored with the alert condition. The condition will also automatically apply to any hosts you add in the future that match these filters. How to notify Conditions are contained in policies. You can select an existing policy or create a new policy with email notifications from the Infrastructure monitoring UI. If you want to create a new policy with other types of notification channels, use the UI. When to notify Email addresses (identified in the policy) will be notified automatically about threshold violations for any host matching the filters you have applied, depending on the policy's incident preferences. Where to troubleshoot The link at the top of the email notification will take you to the infrastructure Events page centered on the time when the host disconnected. Additional links in the email will take you to additional detail. Create \"host not reporting\" condition To define the Host not reporting condition criteria: Follow standard procedures to create an infrastructure condition. Select Host not reporting as the Alert type. Define the Critical threshold for triggering the notification: minimum 5 minutes, maximum 60 minutes. Enable 'Don't trigger alerts for hosts that perform a clean shutdown' option, if you want to prevent false alerts when you have hosts set to shut down via command line. Currently this feature is supported on all Windows systems and Linux systems using systemd. Alternatively, you can add the hostStatus: shutdown tag to your host along with checking the option mentioned above. This will stop all Host Not Reporting violations from opening for that host, as long as that tag is on it, regardless of agent version or OS. Removing the tag will allow the system to open Host Not Reporting violations for that host again. Depending on the policy's incident preferences, it will define which notification channels to use when the defined Critical threshold for the condition passes. To avoid \"false positives,\" the host must stop reporting for the entire time period before a violation is opened. Example: You create a condition to open a violation when any of the filtered set of hosts stop reporting data for seven minutes. If any host stops reporting for five minutes, then resumes reporting, the condition does not open a violation. If any host stops reporting for seven minutes, even if the others are fine, the condition does open a violation. Investigate the problem To further investigate why a host is not reporting data: Review the details in the email notification. Use the link from the email notification to monitor ongoing changes in your environment from Infrastructure monitoring's Events page. For example, use the Events page to help determine if a host disconnected right after a root user made a configuration change to the host. Optional: Use the email notification's Acknowledge link to verify you are aware of and taking ownership of the alerting incident. Use the email links to examine additional details in the Incident details page. Intentional outages We can distinguish between unexpected situations and planned situations with the option Don't trigger alerts for hosts that perform a clean shutdown. Use this option for situations such as: Host has been taken offline intentionally. Host has planned downtime for maintenance. Host has been shut down or decommissioned. Autoscaling hosts or shutting down instances in a cloud console. We rely on Linux and Windows shutdown signals to flag a clean shutdown. We've confirmed that these scenarios are detected by the agent: AWS Auto-scaling event with EC2 instances that use systemd (Amazon Linux, CentOs/RedHat 7 and newer, Ubuntu 16 and newer, Suse 12 and newer, Debian 9 and newer) User-initiated shutdown of Windows systems User-initiated shutdown of Linux systems that use systemd (Amazon Linux, CentOs/RedHat 7 and newer, Ubuntu 16 and newer, Suse 12 and newer, Debian 9 and newer) We know that these scenarios are not detected by the agent: User-initiated shutdown of Linux systems that don't use systemd (CentOs/RedHat 6 and earlier, Ubuntu 14, Debian 8). This includes other modern Linux systems that still use Upstart or SysV init systems.

      "body": "For consistency across New Relic content, here are our general word usage guidelines: We generally follow the Microsoft Style Guide, which is based on the Chicago Manual of Style. We follow American English conventions, rather than British English ones. We defer to the official product names for references to products. (For example, for Amazon Web Services (AWS), see aws.amazon.com/products.) For terminology specific to New Relic, we use the product glossary. account ID A unique number that identifies a particular New Relic account. Don't use account number. agent Don't capitalize. Install the Ruby agent, not Install the Ruby Agent. Don't refer to a Synthetics private minion as an agent. am and pm Use the 12-hour clock followed by the (lowercased) time period am or pm. Don’t put a space after the last number in a timestamp (12:00am, not 12:00 am). Don't include a leading 0 when the hour is less than 10. 9:30am, 12:30pm, 8:30pm Copy Amazon Web Services (AWS) product names Refer to the specific product, not just AWS broadly. As a courtesy to your readers, on first mention always refer to Amazon products by their full names; for example Amazon Web Services (AWS). You can use the acronym after that, if there is one. Example: Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud. After that, use the short name according to the AWS Documentation site. Example: Amazon EC2. app name vs. app alias The \"machine name\" that the collector uses to uniquely identify an app is its app name. The server-side configuration setting that changes the visible \"name\" of an app without changing its unique identifier is its app alias. beta Use the beta callout. In the body text, use lowercase. For example: BETA FEATURE This feature is currently in beta. If the developer team prefers to use a term other than beta or private beta, clarify what is driving that use of the term (Legal requirement?), and add any relevant info here in the usage dictionary. bits and bytes Use standard prefixes and capitalization for International System of Units (SI), International Organization for Standardization (ISO), or Joint Electron Device Engineering Council (JEDEC memory) values when referring to multiples of bits (b) and bytes (B). 1 byte = 8 bits. Decimal value SI prefix Binary value ISO prefix JEDEC prefix 1000 k: kilo 1024 Ki: kibi K: kilo 1000^2 M: mega 1024^2 Mi: mebi M: mega 1000^3 G: giga 1024^3 Gi: gibi G: giga 1000^4 T: tera 1024^4 Ti: tebi - -- 1000^5 P: peta 1024^5 Pi: pebi - -- Tip For help with converting byte values (such as bytes to kilobytes), try this byte converter. blacklist and whitelist Don't use. Instead, use deny list and allow list; for example, \"Add a hostname to your deny list.\" capitalization This is more complex than can be covered in this usage dictionary. For detailed information, see: Heading capitalization Capitalization of features and UI elements Child account A parent account contains one or more child accounts. Child accounts were previously referred to as \"sub-accounts\". click In general, use click rather than the vaguer select. For example, you might click something in the UI, but then select something from a list. Be particularly careful to use click to describe actions that only make sense with a mouse; for example, with a right click or a click and drag. Also use click when the user must click on a non-selectable object (to save your changes, click anywhere outside the dialog box). See also [mouse over] #mouse-over). collector vs. connect to New Relic When referring to an agent talking to the New Relic servers, describe this as the New Relic collector. Although internally the collector refers only to specific parts of our architecture, we use it more broadly in our documentation to mean \"any endpoint a customer must connect to report data, for any product.\" Avoid \"connect to New Relic,\" and do not use \"connect to the New Relic UI.\" contractions When it makes sense for clarity, conciseness, and tone and voice, use contractions. Use them where they make the writing sound more like natural speech, and where they improve clarity and accessibility without sacrificing expertise and authority. There are no hard and fast rules for which contractions are or aren't acceptable, but simple and common is preferable to complicated and rare. For example, it's for it is is fine, but less common constructions like mustn't or wouldn't've are best avoided. Also: When using a negative contraction (don't, can't, won't) try to provide some additional info about what what to do and what can be done. (See the style guide intro for more on this.) There are places in our docs—for example, in notes and warnings—where spelling out do not, cannot, or will not is preferable to contractions to emphasize the action or blockage to be avoided. customer vs. user When possible, use the second person you to form a sense of connection with the reader. For times when you need a descriptive third-person noun, keep the following guidelines in mind: customer and user are both appropriate depending on context. customer makes more sense when talking about billing, or about a group of people or a business entity. For example, one customer may have one or more individual users who interact with New Relic through the customer's account(s). user makes more sense as a general term for an individual user, or when talking about users as an object in the account model. For example, when discussing account models, it's important to be specific about what constitutes a single person identity in our system. dashboard Don't use. Instead, use page. doc, document, documentation, docs site If you need to refer to the docs themselves—don't. Generally it's better to directly link to the doc you're referencing and use the doc title as your link text. For example, See [Install the .NET agent](URL) rather than See our [.NET agent install docs](URL). If there's not a good alternative, doc generally sounds more natural than document or documentation. If you're tempted to use a longer form, try reading it aloud to see which reads best. If you must refer to the site as a whole, call it the docs site rather than Docs site or documentation site. Internally, you can also refer to the whole URL docs.newrelic.com to avoid ambiguity with other sources of docs like internal platform docs or API explorer docs. To refer to our docs GitHub repo, use the repo name docs-website or the repo path newrelic/docs-website. dropdown Use dropdown instead of drop-down or drop down. Although it isn't common usage, you can use dropdown independently as a noun, without needing to say dropdown menu or dropdown list. For example, select a date from the <b>date</b> dropdown. e.g. and i.e. Avoid these Latin abbreviations. Instead of e.g., use for example or such as. Subbing for i.e. is tricker, because sometimes people use it to mean that is, while at other times it's mis-used to mean for example. Read the context to be clear, but usually the best solution is to rewrite so the description is clear without needing explanatory text. em dash (—) Em dashes are rarely needed in tech docs, sadly. You can usually accomplish what you need to by breaking the thought into multiple sentences or using parentheses. In some rare cases, though, an em dash can add drama and spice. If you think you've found such a case, make sure you use them right. An em dash should always use the real em dash character (not a hyphen), and no space before and after. For example: You can sign up for New Relic fast and free—we won't even ask for a credit card number. Copy You can insert an em dash with the COMMAND+OPTION+- shortcut or use the HTML entity. etc. Unlike the Latin abbreviations e.g. or i.e.), you're welcome to use etc. It should have a period at the end (etc.). Ensure that you have several meaningful examples, though, before using it. For example, cities including Portland, Seattle, Dublin, etc. but not cities including Portland, etc.. hostname This is one word. Don't hyphenate. icons When using an inline icon from the UI, always describe it first, then embed the icon image, and then end with the word icon. For example, select the delete icon. Don't put icons in bold. When writing about icons, describe the icon for its purpose or action, not what the icon looks like. For example: Yes: Select the edit icon. No: Select the pencil icon. For technical information on embedding images, see Inserting inline images and Embedding Font Awesome icons. index A list of entities, such as the APM applications index, the Synthetics Monitors index, or the Alerts Incidents index. See also page. infrastructure Avoid using generically, to avoid confusion with infrastructure monitoring. Instead, use an appropriate substitute such as architecture, environment, system, host, etc. introduction Always use Introduction to for overview docs for a particular product. For example, Introduction to New Relic Infrastructure or Introduction to the PHP agent or Introduction to transaction traces. Don't use welcome to, basics, intro, overview, etc. Also avoid the Thing: Tagline format, as in X-Ray sessions: Traces and thread profiles for key transactions, unless having a title with keywords will help with SEO. macOS The proper name for Apple's desktop operating system is macOS. Don't use the older product names Mac OS, Mac OS X, or OS X. master account We previously used master account and sub-account but now we use parent account and child account. menu The list of pages and indexes on the top and left sides of the New Relic user interface. mouse over For mouse movements that involve placing the mouse pointer over an area, but not clicking it. For example, the APM Overview page includes functions that are only visible when the mouse pointer is over a particular chart. Do not use point to or hover over. See also click. .NET Always refer to the agent and language as .NET, never as .Net or .net or dotnet. New Relic One New Relic One isn't a product. It's a way to view New Relic data more easily, all in one place, and from multiple related accounts. This has several implications for how we should refer to it: Avoid phrasing that makes New Relic One sound like a separate product or a separate platform. There is a single New Relic platform through which our users interact with our products. Avoid mentioning New Relic One where it can be avoided. For example, instead of saying \"Use New Relic One workloads to...\", you could instead say, \"In New Relic, you can use workloads to...\" and then in the doc explain where to find the feature. Another example: instead of referring to \"The programmable New Relic One platform,\" we might say, \"The New Relic platform is programmable: To start building, go to one.newrelic.com and...\" Do not use NR1 or nr1 as an abbreviation of New Relic One. The only reason to use nr1 is when referring to the nr1 package or library (for example: a reference to the command nr1 nerdpack:serve). In general, we want to avoid overloading our docs with New Relic. For more details, see the New Relic One messaging guidelines, the docs glossary entry, or the New Relic One docs. Node.js Always refer to the programming language as Node.js, not Node. NR ONLY Use NR ONLY for internal consumption only (such as this style guide). Don't use NR-ONLY or NRONLY or New Relic Only. Oxford comma See serial comma. open source Use lower case for open source. Some legal contracts may require upper case. page A specific place in the New Relic UI, located at a particular URL. Compare and contrast index, menu, and UI. Don't use dashboard, menu, tab, screen, or similar terms. parent account New Relic organizations can have a parent/child account structure. This is more important for our original user model but still plays a role for some behind-the-scenes features on our New Relic One user model. Learn more about account structure. Parent accounts were previously referred to as master accounts, and there are still some uses of this in the codebase. permissions See User-related language. For pricing tier/edition language, see Pricing language. pricing See Pricing language. real user monitoring (RUM) Don't use this outside of browser monitoring docs. Often abbreviated as RUM, this is a generic industry term for browser monitoring. New Relic refers to this as page load timing or browser monitoring. Use this term only for SEO or clarification, not to refer to the actual feature. record vs. report vs. collect Use report when discussing data sent to New Relic, such as, \"your host reports data to New Relic.\" Avoid using report as a noun. Instead use \"the reported metrics\" or \"the collected data.\" If \"report\" sounds too clunky, you can also use collect as long as whatever New Relic is collecting doesn't sound security sensitive. RPM Don't refer to the New Relic UI as RPM. Always refer to the specific product, such as the APM UI or the Browser UI. However, you may use rpm when required in the visible URL string in UI paths. serial comma Also referred to as an Oxford comma. Always use serial commas with inline lists. For example, Portland, Seattle, and Dublin rather than Portland, Seattle and Dublin. time zone Include a space (time zone). Don't hyphenate or run together as timezone. UI The graphical component of a New Relic product, encompassing all its pages, menus, and indexes. See also UI paths. UI paths If you need to tell a user how to path through the UI, see our style guide page on UI paths. update vs. upgrade Use update when users need to change the version of whatever they're using. No money or payment is needed for an update. Use upgrade whenever money or payment may be involved, such as upgrading to the Pro version of a product. The new pricing model makes it unlikely that you'll need to use this. users For styles and formats related to user roles and groups and more, see User-related style. username, not user name One word (username), not two. This is the most common usage and is recommended by Microsoft and Google style guides. version number references When referring to multiple version numbers, always use or higher. Don't use and higher, or the words greater or later. Also don't use punctuation, as in version 1.2+. For example: Foo requires Ruby agent version 1.2.3 or higher. Copy In addition: Tell users to use the latest version and not an up-to-date or current version. To abbreviate the word version, use a lowercase v with no space before the number; for example, v2 or v1.2.3. Use update not upgrade when talking about agent versions, as in \"To update to the latest version...\" For security reasons, do not use version numbers with licensing docs. The Tech Docs team doesn't have a set standard when referring to previous versions. Recommendation: Consider using version x.x or lower when identifying a specific version. Consider using In earlier agent versions when referring to versions more vaguely. we Say we and our when it works with the flow of your writing. Avoid overloading paragraphs with New Relic mentions, or reword so the focus is on the user, not New Relic. For example, avoid writing something like this: New Relic recommends setting a startup timeout. Copy Instead, write something like this: Recommendation: To help with troubleshooting, include a startup timeout in your configuration. Copy OR We recommend setting a startup timeout. Copy you We use you and your liberally in our docs. Addressing the reader directly makes for simpler, cleaner sentences. It also tends to expose lazy uses of passive construction and it helps users to understand procedures.",

      "body": "Callouts direct your attention to information of special importance or to information that doesn't fit smoothly into the main text. Consider your reader. If your doc has too many callouts, it might confuse your reader about what matters the most and distract them from what does. Use your callouts judiciously. Recommendation: Skim the complete doc. If there are too many callouts, decide which ones can be removed. Types of callouts We have a number of callout types, and each is controlled by the variant you include in the <Callout> tag. Here's an example of the format for a tip callout: <Callout variant=\"tip\"> Your tip text goes here. It can have multiple paragraphs. </Callout> Copy Here are examples of our callout variants: Caution Cautions scream at you that this could cause a crash or cost you data loss beyond the task at hand. Cautions use <Callout variant=\"caution\">. At a traffic light, a Caution would be red. Caution Avoid disabling auto-transaction naming, because metric grouping issues will likely occur. Instead, use API calls to name your transactions. Important Important notes urge awareness that this could impair the task at hand or cost you time if you ignore the text. Important notes use <Callout variant=\"important\">. At a traffic light, an Important note would be yellow. Important Custom events sent via the agent API are not compatible with high security mode. Tip Tips whisper to you that this is nice to know, like a shortcut, best practice, or reminder, but is unnecessary to complete the task at hand. Tips use <Callout variant=\"tip\">. At a traffic light, a Tip would be a green light. User-related permissions For recommended wording, see User-related language and styles. Custom callouts Custom callouts are available for special cases, such as beta docs. Here's what you can control with custom callouts: Title text: Change the callout label by inserting the title attribute like this: title=\"YOUR CUSTOM TITLE\". When you publish, this field is automatically converted to all capital letters. Color: The color is limited to the color of the variant you include, or if you don't include a variant, you get the default border color (blue-grey). Here is what the code looks like: <Callout variant=\"caution\" title=\"YOUR CUSTOM TITLE\"> Your callout message goes here! </Callout> Copy For beta docs, add a custom callout. Also, we recommend that you don't include a variant so you display the default color: Beta feature This feature is still in development, but we encourage you to try it out! Avoid callout fatigue Callout fatigue is what happens when there are too many callouts on a doc. A single callout is a great way to draw attention to important information, but the more callouts there are, the more likely it is that your reader won't read the callouts. Keep these things in mind when you're working with callouts: If you add a callout, remove a callout. Wherever possible, don't increase the number of callouts. Do not use stacked callouts. Stacked callouts are two or more callouts that follow directly one after another. Not only do not use these, but if you see this in a doc, take a few minutes to break these callouts up. Remove outdated callouts. As you're going through the docs site, if you see a callout that's outdated, for whatever reason, take a few minutes to delete it from the doc. Be stingy in your use of important and warning callouts. If we use important and warning callouts too often, they lose their effectiveness. Stacked callouts example Here's an example of the stacked callouts we'd love to avoid. Tip The more callouts there are, the more difficult it is to spot the information that's important. Important Not everything is important enough to put in a callout. Caution Think carefully before adding another callout on the page.",

This short video shows twenty of the most common ways to get your data into New Relic (approx. 5:22 minutes): With New Relic, you can: Bring all your data together: Instrument everything and import data from across your technology stack using our agents, integrations, and APIs, and access it from a single UI. Analyze your data: Get all your data at your fingertips to find the root causes of problems and optimize your systems. Build dashboards and charts or use our powerful query language. Respond to incidents quickly: Our machine learning solution proactively detects and explains anomalies and warns you before they become problems. Get started with New Relic Here's how you can quickly get started capturing and analyzing your data: If you don't have a New Relic account, sign up at newrelic.com/signup. It's free, forever! Follow the steps in our Add your data UI page to get data flowing in. For your first install, we recommend the Guided install option, which will set up many integrations with a single command. Once you have data coming into New Relic, learn more about the New Relic UI or set up Alerts. All the answers in one place New Relic is built for full stack observability. It links all relevant data so that you get the whole picture of everything that enables your systems to deliver value to your customers, from the container running a microservice in the cloud to a mobile website's shopping cart button. Monitoring vs. observability: New Relic provides answers to essential questions in one place. As just one example of what you can do with New Relic, imagine you are a Kubernetes administrator overseeing many clusters and pods of software containers. Where do you start troubleshooting? This short video shows how you can locate a problem cluster and use distributed tracing to find relevant logs: Bring all your data together Capture, organize, and make sense of your data in New Relic One, no matter where it comes from. Use our agents and integrations to automatically collect data from common frameworks and tools, or use our APIs for data that’s more specific to your business or technology. If you don't see your technologies or tasks listed here, see a larger list at New Relic Instant Observability. There you will find integrations bundled into quickstarts, providing you instant access to pre-built dashboards and alerts specific to your technology. If you want to... New Relic can help you... Instrument your application Instrument your code: Use our APM agents to automatically instrument your applications in C, Go, Java, .NET, Node.js, PHP, Python, and Ruby. Track transactions: Gather distributed tracing details as your transactions cross boundaries between apps and services. Instrument your environment Instrument your infrastructure: Observe your entire environment (including Linux, Windows, AWS, Azure, Google Cloud Platform, Kubernetes, Docker, and more). Collect and centralize logs: See your log data in context with your other application and infrastructure data. Save time switching between tools and reach solutions more quickly. Instrument your digital experiences Enhance browser performance: Decrease page load times, as well as triage and eliminate errors. Monitor mobile apps: Troubleshoot crashes and check the health of your Android and iOS apps with our mobile agents. Simulate user activity: Ensure you’re meeting customer expectations by running automated checks to monitor key user flows and experiences. Send data via APIs or build your own solution Collect data without an agent: Call our APIs directly if you prefer to use OpenTelemetry or other agents. Build your own integration: You can use our Flex tool, or one of language-specific SDKs for creating your own exporters to send data to New Relic. New Relic One gives you access to a wide range of observability tools, including: Application monitoring Browser monitoring Mobile monitoring Synthetic monitoring Serverless monitoring Infrastructure monitoring Log management You can start anywhere, but you'll never get lost. True observability across your entire stack means that you're in control. Analyze your data With your data secure at New Relic, our platform can alert you to problems and help you organize, process, and understand your data, whether it's metrics, events, logs, or traces: Explore your data visually: Jump into our data explorer to navigate all your data and make connections between your entities without any knowledge of query languages. Query and visualize your data: Use our curated dashboard visualizations or create your own. Use NRQL (New Relic Query Language) to slice and dice your data and dig deeper into questions. Query your data programmatically: Access your data through our NerdGraph GraphQL API. Easily prototype queries in our GraphiQL editor. Respond to incidents faster DevOps, site-reliability, and network operation teams need reliable, real-time alerts and anomaly detection to ensure their systems are always up and running efficiently. Let Applied Intelligence, our hybrid machine learning engine, automatically detect anomalies, reduce alert noise, and enrich incidents with context so that you can respond faster to incidents. Proactive detection: Be notified of unusual app behavior and get an analysis of this unusual behavior sent to Slack. Not using Slack? Set up a webhook to deliver messages when you need them. Get notifications: Set up alerts across your data sources and get notified when systems need your attention. Preserve your attention and control how many threshold violations should fire before you're notified. Troubleshoot from anywhere in your stack Being fully connected, the New Relic UI allows you to start your observability journey from any element of your stack. For example, you can get to crucial infrastructure logs from traces of an application running on a problematic Kubernetes pod. Use the Explorer in New Relic One to access and observe the full stack of your software, see performance data and alerting status at a glance, and check relationships. We provide you with a simple yet powerful visual tool to monitor all your entities, that is, anything we can identify that reports data. In the New Relic ecosystem, entities include basic components like applications, hosts, containers, or database services, but they can also refer to custom groupings of such elements. You can also create your own entities. The more entities you instrument, the more data you'll bring in. The more data you've brought to New Relic, the more you'll understand your metrics, events, logs, and traces.",

      "body": "Our Python agent monitors your Python application to help you identify and solve performance issues. You can also extend your performance monitoring to collect and analyze business data to help you improve the customer experience and make data-driven business decisions. With flexible options for custom instrumentation and APIs, The Python agent offers multiple building blocks to customize the data you need from your app. Our Python works with a wide variety of web frameworks and hosting mechanisms, including Django, Gunicorn, WSGI, CherryPy, uWSGI, and more. You can also install the Python agent in a Google App Engine flexible environment. Monitor app performance After you install the Python agent, it begins to collect data about your app. You can view the data as charts and tables in New Relic One. View the big picture of your app: Monitor your app's Apdex (user satisfaction). Get a high-level summary of your app with Summary page. Enable distributed tracing to see activity across an architecture having many services. Install Infrastructure monitoring and view detailed server/host data for your app. Find errors and problems quickly: Track key transactions specific to your business. Create custom dashboards for important metrics. Alert your team when an error or problem occurs before it affects your users. View performance after a deployment. Drill down into performance details: Examine code-level transaction traces. Examine database query traces. Examine error traces. Use thread profiler sessions to see detailed stack traces of sampled threads View logs for your APM and infrastructure data: Bring your logs and application's data together to make troubleshooting easier and faster. No need to switch to another UI page in New Relic One. With logs in context, you can see log messages related to your errors and traces directly in your app's UI. You can also see logs in context of your infrastructure data, such as Kubernetes clusters. Extend agent instrumentation: Other helpful tools include: Tools Description Browser monitoring Integrate the Python agent with browser monitoring to gain visibility into end-user browser activity. Simple scripts and background tasks Monitor job-based or task queuing systems, like Celery, or other standalone non-web functions. Business data analysis with data exploration. Use the Python agent with our data explorer to organize, query, and visualize your data to answer key questions about application performance and customer experience. Use default transaction attributes, or add your own. Query your data using the New Relic Query Language (NRQL). Send your own event data. Create and share customizable, interactive dashboards. Install the Python agent Before you install the Python agent, make sure your system meets the system requirements. You must also create a New Relic account. We support a number of web frameworks and libraries right out of the box, including Django, WSGI, and Gunicorn. If you use one of the supported web frameworks, installation is easy. If you use an unsupported framework, the process will involve some additions to your app code and/or web server files. For a quick and simple install process that will work for the majority of setups, follow these simple steps: Download and install the Python package. Create config file. Integrate the Python agent with your application. Read the Quick Start guide Add Python data Monitor non-web scripts, background tasks, and functions The Python agent also lets you monitor non-web scripts, worker processes, tasks, and functions. The installation process for these non-web transactions is similar to the one used for a web app, with one major difference: instead of going through the standard integration process described in the install instructions, you would manually \"wrap\" any function you want to monitor. For more information, see Non-web tasks and processes. For instructions on monitoring Celery tasks, see Celery background tasks. What's next after installation? Once you get the agent up and running, some suggested next steps are: Explore your data in and get comfortable with the user interface. Read our docs on our other observability solutions and the APM page. Change your application's name, or other configuration options. Learn about setting up custom instrumentation for application activity not monitored by default. Consider the Python Telemetry SDK. Troubleshooting After you complete the install process, your data should appear in the APM UI within five minutes. If it does not, use these troubleshooting resources: If no data appears, follow these troubleshooting steps. If you experience issues when installing or running the Python agent on a new host, test that the package is installed correctly and that it can contact New Relic's data collector service. For other problems, see the full list of troubleshooting documentation. Check the source code The Python agent is open source software. That means you can browse its source code and send improvements, or create your own fork and build it. For more information, see the README.",

      "body": "The integration of APM and infrastructure data lets you see your APM data and infrastructure data side by side so you can find the root cause of problems more quickly. The main ways to find and use APM data in infrastructure monitoring are: View APM charts on infrastructure monitoring UI pages Filter hosts by application data Switch between infrastructure and APM Examine APM data in Inventory and Events pages Infrastructure data appears in APM in the host table on the APM Summary page. View logs for your APM and infrastructure data You can also bring your logs and application's data together to make troubleshooting easier and faster. With logs in context, you can see log messages related to your errors and traces directly in your app's UI. You can also see logs in context of your infrastructure data, such as Kubernetes clusters. No need to switch to another UI page in New Relic One. How to integrate APM and infrastructure data For APM and infrastructure data to be integrated, all of the following must be true: The APM agent and the infrastructure agent must be installed on the same host. Both agents must use the same New Relic license key. They must use the same hostname. If the integration is not working, see Troubleshooting the APM-Infrastructure integration. View APM charts When your APM and infrastructure data is linked, you have access to APM data charts on these Infrastructure monitoring UI pages: Hosts, Network, Storage, and Processes. To switch to different charts: select the dropdown beside a chart's name and choose a new chart. Application-related charts will be near the top. one.newrelic.com > Infrastructure > Hosts: If your APM and Infrastructure data is linked, the charts in Infrastructure monitoring can be changed to show your application data. Filter by application data When your APM and infrastructure data is linked, you can filter displayed host data using Applications: From the host filter, select Applications. Select the application you want to filter on. Tip On the Hosts page, you can also filter by selecting items in the Applications column. Switch between infrastructure and APM When your APM and infrastructure accounts are linked, you can switch over from infrastructure to APM and vice versa for the same selected time range. You can switch from infrastructure to APM from these locations: From the host filter Applications menu On the Hosts page, when selecting applications in the Applications table column. You can switch from APM to infrastructure from the host table on the APM Summary page. APM data in Inventory and Events When your APM and infrastructure data is linked, you can view and filter on application data on the Infrastructure monitoring UI's Inventory page and the Events page. View host data in APM When your APM and infrastructure data is linked, you have more available host data in APM. The APM Summary page contains a table with data about your app's hosts and instances, including: Apdex Response time Throughput Error rate CPU usage Memory You can toggle between a table view or breakout metric details for the individual hosts by selecting View table or Break out each metric by host. For more information on host data on the APM Summary page, see host details. Troubleshoot missing APM data APM/Infrastructure integration should happen automatically if you have both the APM agent and the infrastructure agent installed on the same host(s) and they use the same New Relic license key and have the same hostname set. If you do not see APM data in infrastructure monitoring, see Troubleshooting.",

      "body": "These are some organization basics. Organize your page to make it easier to read Consider these organization guidelines when thinking about the order of information in a doc. By following these guidelines, you'll make it easier for readers to skim and find what they need. How to organize information Comments Separate what and why from how. Define any necessary prerequisites, policies, or background information (the what and the why) before you step through the how (step-by-step procedures). Examples: Explain what the feature is and why it matters before telling readers how to use it. Describe any limitations with user permissions or subscription levels that would prevent them from using the feature. If the feature is available for any user or subscription level, don't bother to say so. Provide a roadmap for what users will be able to accomplish, so they know before starting a procedure that they have everything they need. Front-load directions with context. Make sure readers know where they need to be, before telling them what to do. In general, use (select an app) to describe what users select from the product index. Examples: Go to one.newrelic.com > Explorer > (select an app or service). Select (account dropdown) > User preferences. On the command line, type gitk. Also, structure steps by front-loading context from the user's point of view. For example, instead of \"Go to x to do y,\" structure the step as \"To do y, go to x.\" Separate requirements from options. Example: Type the Email you use to sign in and to receive information from New Relic. Optional: Type additional user emails, separated by commas. Follow the \"five to nine\" guideline. Depending on the topic, organize the information so there is a maximum of five to nine chunks of information. For example, readers may start to get lost or overwhelmed after about five h2 sections or seven steps into a procedure. If you have more than nine h2 sections or steps, you might need to create an additional doc or procedure. Other organization tools to consider: Levels of headings Lists Collapsers Callouts Tables Code examples For more help section Use action-oriented titles Wherever possible, give your document or h2 heading a task- or action-oriented title. Focus on what users are trying to accomplish or the problem they're trying to solve. Use present-tense verbs, rather than \"-ing\" verbs. Quality Title example Bad The query history Okay View query history Good Query history: Create and edit NRQL queries Start the document with an introductory paragraph Unless the document is less than a single screen in length, begin with a brief paragraph that introduces the topic or summarizes the important points. Not sure where to start? Try writing all the content for your document first, and then add the introduction to the top to summarize your key points. Or use the introduction to expand on the text in your metaDescription in the metadata. Keep documents short The amount of content needed can help you decide whether you need one or more documents for the topic. If all of the document's contents apply directly to the title, then everything belongs in the same document. If several related sections could be logically split into individual documents, and the overall length of your document is more than about two screenfuls, split those sections into other documents. Be sure to include links to the related contents. If a large document needs to be broken into multiple smaller documents, consider whether they might be best grouped together in their own sub-category. Use the New Relic voice We strive for a voice that's approachable, expert, and visionary. Check out our voice guidelines for how to write content with these qualities. And keep in mind these essential writing tips that apply to any type of documentation. Guidelines Comments Be clear and direct. Remember to: Use present tense. Use active voice; avoid passive voice. Tell users what to do, not what they \"should\" do. If absolutely necessary, tell users what not to do in situations where unexpected results may occur. Whenever possible, provide an alternative suggestion when telling users what not to do. Example: Using active voice with an alternative suggestion for what not to do Do not use your config file to change this setting, because this could affect other processes. Instead, go to one.newrelic.com > APM > (select an app or service) > Settings > Application. Write to aid localization and translation. Do not use euphemisms, idioms, jargon, or slang. Use the same terms and wording consistently. If you need to include an abbreviation or acronym, spell it out the first time it appears in the document. Always take a moment to ask yourself whether people will really understand the terms you are using in the way you're using them. Change doc titles and anchors Because changes to doc titles, anchors, and redirects can break links to other docs, please create an issue to request these types of changes and we'll help you out with that. Create and edit categories Because changes to categories can affect large groups of docs at once, please create an issue to request these types of changes and we'll help you out with that.

They can also: Capture aggregate numbers, including an overview or summary for ping monitors. Provide detailed statistics for each page resource, and downtime incidents. Collect custom response codes for more detail on your monitor runs. You'll be able to add and configure synthetic monitors to suit your environnment after you create a New Relic account. (It's free, forever!) Add a monitor You can add several types of synthetic monitors: Ping monitors ensure your website is responding, while simple browser monitors send real browsers to check your website. For more complex monitoring, scripted browser monitors verify that specific resources are present, while API tests verify your API endpoint. The default timeout for a new monitor is 180 seconds. To learn how to use our step monitor to build complex workflow validation scripts without writing any code, watch this short YouTube video (approx. 3:20 minutes). Add a ping or simple browser monitor Go to one.newrelic.com > Synthetics > Create monitor. Specify a monitor type, name, and URL (may be any valid HTTP or HTTPS URL). Optional: Add a validation string or Advanced options: A validation string is available for ping and simple browser. This option enables substring monitoring for response validation. Verify SSL is available for ping and simple browser. This option verifies the validity of the SSL certificate chain. It can be duplicated by running the following syntax: openssl s_client -servername {YOUR_HOSTNAME} -connect {YOUR_HOSTNAME}:443 -CApath /etc/ssl/certs -verify_hostname {YOUR_HOSTNAME} > /dev/null Copy If a non-zero exit code is returned, the monitor will fail. The Bypass HEAD request option is available for ping. This option skips the default HEAD request and instead uses the GET verb with a ping check. Redirect is Failure is available for ping. If a redirect result occurs when Redirect is Failure is enabled, New Relic Synthetics will categorize the result as a failure, rather than following the redirect and checking the resulting URL.

Build your monitor by selecting from the preconfigured steps at the bottom of the UI: Navigate to a URL Type text Click an element Assert text Assert an element Secure a credential Use the instructions on the right side of the UI to help locate elements by CSS class, HTML ID, link text, or XPath. Select Save monitor to confirm. Generate some traffic and wait a few minutes, then check your monitor from the Monitors index. Add a certificate check monitor Go to one.newrelic.com > Synthetics > Create monitor. Select the certificate check monitor type. Specify a name and enter the domain you'd like to monitor. Enter the number of days it takes for your certificate to expire. Select the period to determine your monitor's frequency. Optional: Add tags to help you find this monitor later. Select the locations from which you want your monitor to run, and then click Save monitor to confirm. Generate some traffic and wait a few minutes, then check your monitor from the Monitors index. Add a broken links monitor Go to one.newrelic.com > Synthetics > Create monitor. Select the broken links check monitor type. Specify a name and enter the URL you'd like to monitor (may be any valid HTTP or HTTPS URL). Select the period to determine your monitor's frequency. Optional: Add tags to help you find this monitor later. Select the locations from which you want your monitor to run, and then click Save monitor to confirm. Generate some traffic and wait a few minutes, then check your monitor from the Monitors index. Tip You can also add monitors with the Synthetics REST API. For example, you can create a GET request to the monitor you want to use as the source for configuration, then use those key values to use in a POST to \"copy\" and create a new monitor. Edit a monitor You cannot change a monitor's type after the monitor is created, but you can edit other monitor settings. From the Monitors tab in one.newrelic.com > Synthetics, select the monitor you want to edit. In the side menu, select a link to change the following settings: Select Settings > General to edit name, Apdex T, URL, locations, frequency, and advanced options. For Scripted browser and API test monitors, select Settings > Script to edit your monitor script. For synthetic monitoring alerts, click Manage alerts. Select Save changes to confirm. Delete a monitor You must have Admin privileges in order to delete a monitor. To delete a monitor: From the Monitors tab in one.newrelic.com > Synthetics, select the monitor you want to edit. From the selected monitor, select Settings > General. Scroll to the bottom of the page and select the trash can icon. Tip You can also delete a monitor with the Synthetics REST API. Monitor settings When configuring monitors, the following settings are available: Type Select the type of monitor you want to create. A monitor's type can't be changed after the monitor is created. Ping: Specify a single URL to monitor for availability. New Relic will check this URL via HEAD or GET requests. The non-configurable timeout for this monitor is 60 seconds. Simple browser: Specify a single URL to monitor via real browser. Once each frequency interval, New Relic will check this URL via a Selenium-powered Google Chrome browser. The non-configurable timeout for this monitor is 60 seconds. Scripted browser: Create a script to drive a Selenium-powered Google Chrome browser. The browser follows each step in the script to verify that complex behavior is working as expected (for example, searching a website, then clicking one of the search results). The non-configurable timeout for this monitor is 180 seconds. API test: Create an API script to ensure your API endpoint is working correctly. For more information, see Write API tests. The non-configurable timeout for this monitor is 180 seconds. Monitor name Defines a name for the monitor. Monitor names cannot contain unencoded angle brackets (< >). To include angle brackets in a monitor name, encode them as HTML bracket entities (&lt; &gt;) in the UI or API. Location Select the locations where you want your monitor to run. Select more locations to ensure that your application is available to users around the world. If you have any private locations, they will be listed here too. You can use the Synthetics API location endpoint to retrieve a list of valid locations for your account. Your monitor will run one check from each selected location during each frequency interval. For example, if you select three locations and define a frequency of 15 minutes, your monitor will run three checks in each 15 minute period (or 8,640 checks per month). Frequency Select how often the monitor runs, in increments of minutes, hours, or 1 day. This frequency applies to each location. For example, if you select three locations and a Frequency of 15 minutes, your monitor will run three checks, on average every 5 minutes, in each 15 minute period (or 8,640 checks per month). Alerts Specify an email address to receive alerts when a monitor fails. Or, attach a monitor to an existing alert policy for more notification options. For more information, see Alerting for synthetic monitoring. Apdex T Customize the Apdex T for this monitor. This setting is only available when editing the settings for an existing monitor, not when creating a new monitor. Change the Apdex T from the default 7 seconds for more accurate Apdex scores in your SLA reports. For example, if you have a very long scripted browser, you might adjust the Apdex T to 15 seconds to more closely reflect the usual completion time. Similarly, a good Apdex T for a simple browser check might be only 2 seconds. Response Validation (optional) Specify text to search for on the page. When using simple browser or ping monitor types, there is a 1MB (10^6 bytes) limit on the page load. See a history of monitor changes You can use New Relic One to see a history of recent changes to synthetic monitors and what users changed them.",

Use the Synthetics REST API to manage monitors. Set up monitors from specific locations or for private servers. You can also use the host not reporting feature in infrastructure monitoring. This allows you to take advantage of enhanced monitoring options and be notified when New Relic has stopped receiving data from your hosts. Types of monitors These are the seven types of synthetic monitors: Type of synthetic monitor Description Broken links monitor API name: SCRIPT_API Provide a url and this monitor will test all the links on the page for success. If a failure is detected you can view the individual non-successful links that caused the failure. Certificate check monitor API name: SCRIPT_API Proactively ping your domain certificates based on a configurable threshold. Pair with an alert to ensure you are notified when your certificates need renewed. Ping monitor API name: SIMPLE Ping monitors are the simplest type of monitor. They simply check to see if an application is online. The synthetic ping monitor uses a simple Java HTTP client to make requests to your site. For consistency with other synthetic monitor types, the user agent is identified as Google Chrome. However, the HTTP client is not a full browser, and it does not execute JavaScript. If you need JavaScript functionality, use a simple browser monitor. Step monitor API name: STEP_MONITOR Step monitors are advanced monitors which require no code to set up. The monitor can be configured to: Assert modal Assert text Assert title Assert an element Click an element Dismiss a modal Double click an element Enter a secure credential Hover over an element Locate an element by CSS class, HTML ID, link text, Xpath, or value Navigate to a URL Select from a dropdown Type text Simple browser monitors API name: BROWSER Simple browser monitors essentially are simple, pre-built scripted browser monitors. They make a request to your site using an instance of Google Chrome. Compared to a simple ping monitor, this is a more accurate emulation of an actual customer visit. The user agent is identified as Google Chrome. Scripted browser monitors API name: SCRIPT_BROWSER Scripted browser monitors are used for more sophisticated, customized monitoring. You can create a custom script that navigates your website, takes specific actions, and ensures specific resources are present. The monitor uses Google Chrome browser. You can also use a variety of third-party modules to build your custom monitor. API tests API name: SCRIPT_API API tests are used to monitor your API endpoints. This can ensure that your app server works in addition to your website. New Relic uses the http-request module internally to make HTTP calls to your endpoint and validate the results. You can add and edit synthetic monitors directly in our UI. You can also create some synthetic monitors with Terraform. To learn how, watch this short YouTube video (approx. 3:25 minutes).",

      "body": "Use the Synthetics REST API to create and manage synthetic monitors of all types: ping, simple browser, scripted browser, and API test monitors. All synthetic monitoring data is available via the REST API. To use the Synthetics REST API, you must have a user role that allows that capability and a user key. For an overview of all available New Relic APIs, see Intro to APIs. Features The newest version of the Synthetics API (v3) adds these features: Synthetics API (v3) Features Options field for POST and PUT request You can specify the options for SIMPLE and BROWSER type monitors, similar to the way these options are available in the UI. PATCH request You can update only the fields of a monitor you want to change, rather than having to specify the entire monitor entity in a PUT. You can also specify the OPTION, assuming you are using the appropriate type of monitor. More detail with 400 Bad Request errors As of v3, the Synthetics API attempts to return as much information as possible when a validation failure occurs. This will help you figure out what might be wrong with the request. The API runs all validations and returns any failed validation messages, rather than failing on the first validation error as occurred in previous API versions. Pagination Large API responses are properly paginated. You can also use NRQL queries to analyze past changes made via the API. Monitor types in API These are the monitor types and how they're referred to in the API: Monitor type API name Ping SIMPLE Simple browser BROWSER Scripted browser SCRIPT_BROWSER API test SCRIPT_API Use the API To use the Synthetics REST API, you must have the ability to manage synthetics monitors and use a user key (the REST API key won't work). This API can be used for all Synthetics monitors. (Additional API methods for scripted browser and API test monitors are also available to update the script associated with those monitors.) All Synthetics data is available via the API. API examples show cURL commands. For US-based accounts, use the following endpoint: https://synthetics.newrelic.com/synthetics/api Copy For EU-based accounts, use the following endpoint: https://synthetics.eu.newrelic.com/synthetics/api Copy Caution The Synthetics REST API limits an account's rate of requests to three requests per second. Requests made in excess of this threshold will return a 429 response code. Get all monitors To view a list of all the monitors in your New Relic account, send a GET request to $API_ENDPOINT/v3/monitors. For example: curl -v \\ -H 'Api-Key:$API_KEY' $API_ENDPOINT/v3/monitors Copy A successful request will return a 200 OK response. The data returned will be a JSON object in the following format: { \"monitors\": [ { \"id\": \"2a1bc369-7654-489d-918e-f6g135h7i2jk\", \"name\": \"monitor1\", \"type\": \"BROWSER\", \"frequency\": 60, \"uri\": \"http://example.com\", \"locations\": [ \"AWS_US_WEST_1\" ], \"status\": \"DISABLED\", \"slaThreshold\": 7, \"options\": {}, \"modifiedAt\": \"2016-09-26T23:12:46.981+0000\", \"createdAt\": \"2016-09-26T23:12:46.981+0000\", \"userId\": 0, \"apiVersion\": \"0.2.2\" } ], \"count\": 1 } Copy Query arguments: offset: The monitor count offset. Defaults to 0. For example, if you have 40 monitors and you use an offset value of 20, it will return monitors 21-40. limit: The number of results per page, maximum 100. Defaults to 50. You can include these in your cURL command as follows: curl -v \\ -H 'Api-Key:$API_KEY' $API_ENDPOINT/v3/monitors \\ -G -d 'offset=20&limit=100' Copy The headers include a Link to help you easily page your monitors. For example: <https://synthetics.newrelic.com/synthetics/api/v3/monitors/?offset=0&limit=20>; rel=\"first\", <https://synthetics.newrelic.com/synthetics/api/v3/monitors/?offset=40&limit=20>; rel=\"last\" Copy Get a specific monitor To view a single Synthetics monitor, send a GET request to $API_ENDPOINT/v3/monitors/$MONITOR_ID. curl -v \\ -H 'Api-Key:$API_KEY' $API_ENDPOINT/v3/monitors/$MONITOR_ID Copy A successful request will return a 200 OK response. The data returned will be a JSON object in the following format: { \"id\": UUID, \"name\": string, \"type\": string, \"frequency\": integer, \"uri\": string, \"locations\": array of strings, \"status\": string, \"slaThreshold\": double, \"userId\": integer, \"apiVersion\": string } Copy An invalid monitor ID will return 404 Not Found: The specified monitor doesn't exist. Create a monitor To add a new monitor to your Synthetics account, send a POST request to $API_ENDPOINT/v3/monitors with a JSON payload that describes the monitor. All fields in the following example are required unless stated otherwise: { \"name\": string [required], \"type\": string (SIMPLE, BROWSER, SCRIPT_API, SCRIPT_BROWSER) [required], \"frequency\": integer (minutes) [required, must be one of 1, 5, 10, 15, 30, 60, 360, 720, or 1440], \"uri\": string [required for SIMPLE and BROWSER type], \"locations\": array of strings [at least one required], \"status\": string (ENABLED, MUTED, DISABLED) [required], \"slaThreshold\": double, \"options\": { \"validationString\": string [only valid for SIMPLE and BROWSER types], \"verifySSL\": boolean (true, false) [only valid for SIMPLE and BROWSER types], \"bypassHEADRequest\": boolean (true, false) [only valid for SIMPLE types], \"treatRedirectAsFailure\": boolean (true, false) [only valid for SIMPLE types] } } Copy In addition, to add the script for a scripted monitor via the REST API, call an additional API endpoint to send the script for the monitor just created. If you are using private locations with verified script execution enabled, see script locations with verified script execution. Replace the Synthetics REST API attributes in the following example with your specific values: curl -v \\ -X POST -H 'Api-Key:$API_KEY' \\ -H 'Content-Type: application/json' $API_ENDPOINT/v3/monitors \\ -d '{ \"name\" : \"monitor1\", \"frequency\" : 15, \"uri\" : \"http://my-uri.com\", \"locations\" : [ \"AWS_US_WEST_1\" ], \"type\" : \"browser\", \"status\" : \"enabled\", \"slaThreshold\" : \"1.0\"}' Copy A successful request will return a 201 Created response, with the URI of the newly-created monitor specified in the location header. Possible error codes include: 400 Bad Request: One or more of the monitor values is invalid, or the format of the request is invalid. For example: the frequency is out of bounds or one or more of the specified locations is invalid. (See the error message in the body of the response.) 402 Payment Required: Creating the monitor will increase your scheduled checks past your account's purchased check limit. Update an existing monitor To update an existing monitor in New Relic, send a PUT request to $API_ENDPOINT/v3/monitors/$MONITOR_ID. In addition, for scripted monitors, follow the procedures to update the BASE64 encoded script. All fields are required. However, the TYPE of the monitor cannot be changed. Use a specific monitor ID, and replace the Synthetics REST API attributes with your specific values. curl -v \\ -X PUT -H 'Api-Key:$API_KEY' \\ -H 'Content-Type: application/json' $API_ENDPOINT/v3/monitors/$MONITOR_ID \\ -d '{ \"name\" : \"updated monitor name\", \"type\": \"monitor type\", \"frequency\" : 15, \"uri\" : \"http://my-uri.com/\", \"locations\" : [ \"AWS_US_WEST_1\" ], \"status\" : \"enabled\", \"slaThreshold\": \"7.0\" }' Copy PUT requests are intended to replace target entities, so all attributes required in the JSON payload when creating a new monitor are also required when updating an existing monitor. A successful request will return a 204 No Content response, with an empty body. Possible error codes include: 400 Bad Request: One or more of the monitor values is invalid, or the format of the request is invalid. For example, the frequency is out of bounds or one or more of the specified locations is invalid. (See the error message in the body of the response.) 404 Not Found: The specified monitor does not exist. Patch an existing monitor To patch an existing monitor in New Relic, send a PATCH request to $API_ENDPOINT/v3/monitors/$MONITOR_ID. Use a specific monitor ID, and replace the Synthetics REST API attributes with your specific values. curl -v \\ -X PATCH -H 'Api-Key:$API_KEY' \\ -H 'Content-Type: application/json' $API_ENDPOINT/v3/monitors/$MONITOR_ID \\ -d '{ \"name\" : \"updated monitor name\" }' Copy PATCH requests are intended to update individual attributes of your New Relic Synthetics monitor rather than updating the entire entity, so you may provide only the attributes you want to update. A successful request will return a 204 No Content response, with an empty body. Possible error codes include: 400 Bad Request: One or more of the monitor values is invalid, or the format of the request is invalid. For example, the frequency is out of bounds, or one or more of the specified locations is invalid. (See the error message in the body of the response.) 404 Not Found: The specified monitor does not exist. Delete an existing monitor To delete an existing monitor in New Relic Synthetics, send a DELETE request to $API_ENDPOINT/v3/monitors/$MONITOR_ID: curl -v \\ -H 'Api-Key:$API_KEY' \\ -X DELETE $API_ENDPOINT/v3/monitors/$MONITOR_ID Copy A successful request will return a 204 No Content response, with an empty body. An unsuccessful request will return the response 404 Not Found: The specified monitor does not exist. Get a list of valid locations To retrieve the list of valid locations in New Relic Synthetics, use the following command: curl -v \\ -X GET -H 'Api-Key:$API_KEY' $API_ENDPOINT/v1/locations Copy Script API for scripted browser and API test monitors In addition to the general API, there are several API methods for the scripted browsers (SCRIPT_BROWSER) and API test browsers (SCRIPT_API). These examples show cURL commands. Get monitor script To view the script associated with a specific SCRIPT_BROWSER or SCRIPT_API monitor in New Relic Synthetics for your account, send a GET request to $API_ENDPOINT/v3/monitors/$MONITOR_ID/script. For example: curl -v -H 'Api-Key: $API_KEY' $API_ENDPOINT/v3/monitors/$MONITOR_ID/script Copy A successful request will return a 200 OK response. The data returned will be a JSON object in the following format: { \"scriptText\": BASE64 encoded string } Copy Possible error codes include: 403 Forbidden: The specified monitor is not of type SCRIPT_BROWSER or SCRIPT_API. 404 Not Found: The specified monitor doesn't exist or the script associated with the monitor doesn't exist. Add scripted monitor To add a new scripted monitor to New Relic Synthetics with the REST API: Follow standard API procedures to add a new monitor, and identify the type as a SCRIPT_BROWSER or SCRIPT_API. Update the new monitor with a BASE64 encoded version of the script to the $MONITOR_UUID/script endpoint. For more information, refer to the example. If you are using private locations with verified script execution enabled, see script locations with verified script execution. Update monitor script To update the script associated with a specific SCRIPT_BROWSER or SCRIPT_API monitor in New Relic Synthetics for your account, send a PUT request to $API_ENDPOINT/v3/monitors/$MONITOR_ID/script with a JSON payload that contains the scriptText (required). scriptPayload='{\"scriptText\":BASE64 encoded string}' curl -v -X PUT \\ -H 'Api-Key:$API_KEY' \\ -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \\ $API_ENDPOINT/v3/monitors/$MONITOR_UUID/script \\ -d $scriptPayload Copy If you are using private locations with verified script execution enabled, see script locations with verified script execution. A successful request will return a 204 No Content response with an empty body. Possible error codes include: 400 Bad Request: Invalid BASE64 encoded string for scriptText or hmac. 403 Forbidden: The specified monitor is not of the type SCRIPT_BROWSER or SCRIPT_API. 404 Not Found: The specified monitor does not exist. Using private location scripts with verified script execution When creating or updating monitors for private locations that have verified script execution turned on, you must use scriptLocations to set the password: { \"scriptText\": BASE64 encoded String, \"scriptLocations\": [ { \"name\": Location name, \"hmac\" BASE64 encoded String of SHA256 HMAC for location } ] } Copy The password used to generate the HMAC string must match the password set for the private location. If you have multiple locations with Verified script execution enabled each location must have the HMAC calculated. When generating the HMAC string, use the SHA256 algorithm with the script and password. Here's an example for the script: var assert = require('assert'); assert.equal('1', '1'); Copy This example uses password as the password for the scriptLocation: curl -v -X PUT -H 'Api-Key: '$API_KEY' -H 'content-type: application/json' $API_ENDPOINT}/v3/monitors/$MONITOR_ID/script -d '{ \"scriptText\": \"dmFyIGFzc2VydCA9IHJlcXVpcmUoJ2Fzc2VydCcpOw0KYXNzZXJ0LmVxdWFsKCcxJywgJzEnKTs=\",\"scriptLocations\": [ { \"name\": \"my_vse_enabled_location\", \"hmac\": \"MjhiNGE4MjVlMDE1N2M4NDQ4MjNjNDFkZDEyYTRjMmUzZDE3NGJlNjU0MWFmOTJlMzNiODExOGU2ZjhkZTY4ZQ==\"} ]}' Copy Important You must remove the last newline character from both the script and the calculated HMAC value before encoding in BASE64. Calculation steps: Calculate the HMAC value from the script. One way is to use: cat script | openssl dgst -sha256 -hmac \"password\" > hmac Remove the newline character if one was added by openssl. Encode the HMAC in BASE64 without line breaks. Scripted browser example Here is an example of using New Relic's REST API and the bash script to create a scripted browser monitor. Scripted browser API example The following example shows cURL commands to create a scripted browser monitor. At the top of the script, replace the variables with your specific values. For the scriptfile variable, identify the filename for the script to be created. Here is a sample script that can be saved as sample_synth_script.js to use in the example: var assert = require(\"assert\"); $browser.get(\"http://example.com\").then(function(){ // Check the H1 title matches \"Example Domain\" return $browser.findElement($driver.By.css(\"h1\")).then(function(element){ return element.getText().then(function(text){ assert.equal(\"Example Domain\", text, \"Page H1 title did not match\"); }); }); }).then(function(){ // Check that the external link matches \"http://www.iana.org/domains/example\" return $browser.findElement($driver.By.css(\"div > p > a\")).then(function(element){ return element.getAttribute(\"href\").then(function(link){ assert.equal(\"http://www.iana.org/domains/example\", link, \"More information link did not match\"); }); }); }); Copy Bash script example This example shows the bash script that will create the SCRIPTED_BROWSER monitor.

      "body": "Synthetic monitors are API checks or virtual browser instances that monitor your website, recording each check in detail. They can also: Capture aggregate numbers, including an overview or summary for ping monitors. Provide detailed statistics for each page resource, and downtime incidents. Collect custom response codes for more detail on your monitor runs. You'll be able to add and configure synthetic monitors to suit your environnment after you create a New Relic account. (It's free, forever!) Add a monitor You can add several types of synthetic monitors: Ping monitors ensure your website is responding, while simple browser monitors send real browsers to check your website. For more complex monitoring, scripted browser monitors verify that specific resources are present, while API tests verify your API endpoint. The default timeout for a new monitor is 180 seconds. To learn how to use our step monitor to build complex workflow validation scripts without writing any code, watch this short YouTube video (approx. 3:20 minutes). Add a ping or simple browser monitor Go to one.newrelic.com > Synthetics > Create monitor. Specify a monitor type, name, and URL (may be any valid HTTP or HTTPS URL). Optional: Add a validation string or Advanced options: A validation string is available for ping and simple browser. This option enables substring monitoring for response validation. Verify SSL is available for ping and simple browser. This option verifies the validity of the SSL certificate chain. It can be duplicated by running the following syntax: openssl s_client -servername {YOUR_HOSTNAME} -connect {YOUR_HOSTNAME}:443 -CApath /etc/ssl/certs -verify_hostname {YOUR_HOSTNAME} > /dev/null Copy If a non-zero exit code is returned, the monitor will fail. The Bypass HEAD request option is available for ping. This option skips the default HEAD request and instead uses the GET verb with a ping check. Redirect is Failure is available for ping. If a redirect result occurs when Redirect is Failure is enabled, New Relic Synthetics will categorize the result as a failure, rather than following the redirect and checking the resulting URL. Select the locations from which you want your monitor to run. Choose a frequency to determine how often each location will run your monitor. Optional: Set up alert notifications. Select Create my monitor to confirm. Generate some traffic and wait a few minutes, then check your monitor from the Monitors index. Add a scripted browser or API test monitor Go to one.newrelic.com > Synthetics > Create monitor. Specify a monitor type and name. Select the locations from which you want your monitor to run. Choose a frequency to determine how often each location will run your monitor. Optional: Set up alert notifications. Select Next: Write your script to create a script for your scripted browser or API test, then select Validate to verify your syntax. Tip For complex scripts, validation may take up to one minute. Select Create my monitor to confirm. Generate some traffic and wait a few minutes, then check your monitor from the Monitors index. Add a step monitor Go to one.newrelic.com > Synthetics > Create monitor. Select step monitor as the monitor type. Specify a name and choose a frequency to determine how often each location will run your monitor. Select the locations from which you want your monitor to run. Build your monitor by selecting from the preconfigured steps at the bottom of the UI: Navigate to a URL Type text Click an element Assert text Assert an element Secure a credential Use the instructions on the right side of the UI to help locate elements by CSS class, HTML ID, link text, or XPath. Select Save monitor to confirm. Generate some traffic and wait a few minutes, then check your monitor from the Monitors index. Add a certificate check monitor Go to one.newrelic.com > Synthetics > Create monitor. Select the certificate check monitor type. Specify a name and enter the domain you'd like to monitor. Enter the number of days it takes for your certificate to expire. Select the period to determine your monitor's frequency. Optional: Add tags to help you find this monitor later. Select the locations from which you want your monitor to run, and then click Save monitor to confirm. Generate some traffic and wait a few minutes, then check your monitor from the Monitors index. Add a broken links monitor Go to one.newrelic.com > Synthetics > Create monitor. Select the broken links check monitor type. Specify a name and enter the URL you'd like to monitor (may be any valid HTTP or HTTPS URL). Select the period to determine your monitor's frequency. Optional: Add tags to help you find this monitor later. Select the locations from which you want your monitor to run, and then click Save monitor to confirm. Generate some traffic and wait a few minutes, then check your monitor from the Monitors index. Tip You can also add monitors with the Synthetics REST API. For example, you can create a GET request to the monitor you want to use as the source for configuration, then use those key values to use in a POST to \"copy\" and create a new monitor. Edit a monitor You cannot change a monitor's type after the monitor is created, but you can edit other monitor settings. From the Monitors tab in one.newrelic.com > Synthetics, select the monitor you want to edit. In the side menu, select a link to change the following settings: Select Settings > General to edit name, Apdex T, URL, locations, frequency, and advanced options. For Scripted browser and API test monitors, select Settings > Script to edit your monitor script. For synthetic monitoring alerts, click Manage alerts. Select Save changes to confirm. Delete a monitor You must have Admin privileges in order to delete a monitor. To delete a monitor: From the Monitors tab in one.newrelic.com > Synthetics, select the monitor you want to edit. From the selected monitor, select Settings > General. Scroll to the bottom of the page and select the trash can icon. Tip You can also delete a monitor with the Synthetics REST API. Monitor settings When configuring monitors, the following settings are available: Type Select the type of monitor you want to create. A monitor's type can't be changed after the monitor is created. Ping: Specify a single URL to monitor for availability. New Relic will check this URL via HEAD or GET requests. The non-configurable timeout for this monitor is 60 seconds. Simple browser: Specify a single URL to monitor via real browser. Once each frequency interval, New Relic will check this URL via a Selenium-powered Google Chrome browser. The non-configurable timeout for this monitor is 60 seconds. Scripted browser: Create a script to drive a Selenium-powered Google Chrome browser. The browser follows each step in the script to verify that complex behavior is working as expected (for example, searching a website, then clicking one of the search results). The non-configurable timeout for this monitor is 180 seconds. API test: Create an API script to ensure your API endpoint is working correctly. For more information, see Write API tests. The non-configurable timeout for this monitor is 180 seconds. Monitor name Defines a name for the monitor. Monitor names cannot contain unencoded angle brackets (< >). To include angle brackets in a monitor name, encode them as HTML bracket entities (&lt; &gt;) in the UI or API. Location Select the locations where you want your monitor to run. Select more locations to ensure that your application is available to users around the world. If you have any private locations, they will be listed here too. You can use the Synthetics API location endpoint to retrieve a list of valid locations for your account. Your monitor will run one check from each selected location during each frequency interval. For example, if you select three locations and define a frequency of 15 minutes, your monitor will run three checks in each 15 minute period (or 8,640 checks per month). Frequency Select how often the monitor runs, in increments of minutes, hours, or 1 day. This frequency applies to each location. For example, if you select three locations and a Frequency of 15 minutes, your monitor will run three checks, on average every 5 minutes, in each 15 minute period (or 8,640 checks per month). Alerts Specify an email address to receive alerts when a monitor fails. Or, attach a monitor to an existing alert policy for more notification options. For more information, see Alerting for synthetic monitoring. Apdex T Customize the Apdex T for this monitor. This setting is only available when editing the settings for an existing monitor, not when creating a new monitor. Change the Apdex T from the default 7 seconds for more accurate Apdex scores in your SLA reports. For example, if you have a very long scripted browser, you might adjust the Apdex T to 15 seconds to more closely reflect the usual completion time. Similarly, a good Apdex T for a simple browser check might be only 2 seconds. Response Validation (optional) Specify text to search for on the page. When using simple browser or ping monitor types, there is a 1MB (10^6 bytes) limit on the page load.

They make a request to your site using an instance of Google Chrome. Compared to a simple ping monitor, this is a more accurate emulation of an actual customer visit. The user agent is identified as Google Chrome. Scripted browser monitors API name: SCRIPT_BROWSER Scripted browser monitors are used for more sophisticated, customized monitoring. You can create a custom script that navigates your website, takes specific actions, and ensures specific resources are present. The monitor uses Google Chrome browser. You can also use a variety of third-party modules to build your custom monitor. API tests API name: SCRIPT_API API tests are used to monitor your API endpoints. This can ensure that your app server works in addition to your website. New Relic uses the http-request module internally to make HTTP calls to your endpoint and validate the results.

      "body": "Synthetic monitors are API checks or virtual browser instances that monitor your website, recording each check in detail. They can also: Capture aggregate numbers, including an overview or summary for ping monitors. Provide detailed statistics for each page resource, and downtime incidents. Collect custom response codes for more detail on your monitor runs. You'll be able to add and configure synthetic monitors to suit your environnment after you create a New Relic account. (It's free, forever!) Add a monitor You can add several types of synthetic monitors: Ping monitors ensure your website is responding, while simple browser monitors send real browsers to check your website. For more complex monitoring, scripted browser monitors verify that specific resources are present, while API tests verify your API endpoint. The default timeout for a new monitor is 180 seconds. To learn how to use our step monitor to build complex workflow validation scripts without writing any code, watch this short YouTube video (approx. 3:20 minutes). Add a ping or simple browser monitor Go to one.newrelic.com > Synthetics > Create monitor. Specify a monitor type, name, and URL (may be any valid HTTP or HTTPS URL). Optional: Add a validation string or Advanced options: A validation string is available for ping and simple browser. This option enables substring monitoring for response validation. Verify SSL is available for ping and simple browser. This option verifies the validity of the SSL certificate chain. It can be duplicated by running the following syntax: openssl s_client -servername {YOUR_HOSTNAME} -connect {YOUR_HOSTNAME}:443 -CApath /etc/ssl/certs -verify_hostname {YOUR_HOSTNAME} > /dev/null Copy If a non-zero exit code is returned, the monitor will fail. The Bypass HEAD request option is available for ping. This option skips the default HEAD request and instead uses the GET verb with a ping check. Redirect is Failure is available for ping. If a redirect result occurs when Redirect is Failure is enabled, New Relic Synthetics will categorize the result as a failure, rather than following the redirect and checking the resulting URL. Select the locations from which you want your monitor to run. Choose a frequency to determine how often each location will run your monitor. Optional: Set up alert notifications. Select Create my monitor to confirm. Generate some traffic and wait a few minutes, then check your monitor from the Monitors index. Add a scripted browser or API test monitor Go to one.newrelic.com > Synthetics > Create monitor. Specify a monitor type and name. Select the locations from which you want your monitor to run. Choose a frequency to determine how often each location will run your monitor. Optional: Set up alert notifications. Select Next: Write your script to create a script for your scripted browser or API test, then select Validate to verify your syntax. Tip For complex scripts, validation may take up to one minute. Select Create my monitor to confirm. Generate some traffic and wait a few minutes, then check your monitor from the Monitors index. Add a step monitor Go to one.newrelic.com > Synthetics > Create monitor. Select step monitor as the monitor type. Specify a name and choose a frequency to determine how often each location will run your monitor. Select the locations from which you want your monitor to run. Build your monitor by selecting from the preconfigured steps at the bottom of the UI: Navigate to a URL Type text Click an element Assert text Assert an element Secure a credential Use the instructions on the right side of the UI to help locate elements by CSS class, HTML ID, link text, or XPath. Select Save monitor to confirm. Generate some traffic and wait a few minutes, then check your monitor from the Monitors index. Add a certificate check monitor Go to one.newrelic.com > Synthetics > Create monitor. Select the certificate check monitor type. Specify a name and enter the domain you'd like to monitor. Enter the number of days it takes for your certificate to expire. Select the period to determine your monitor's frequency. Optional: Add tags to help you find this monitor later. Select the locations from which you want your monitor to run, and then click Save monitor to confirm. Generate some traffic and wait a few minutes, then check your monitor from the Monitors index. Add a broken links monitor Go to one.newrelic.com > Synthetics > Create monitor. Select the broken links check monitor type. Specify a name and enter the URL you'd like to monitor (may be any valid HTTP or HTTPS URL). Select the period to determine your monitor's frequency. Optional: Add tags to help you find this monitor later. Select the locations from which you want your monitor to run, and then click Save monitor to confirm. Generate some traffic and wait a few minutes, then check your monitor from the Monitors index. Tip You can also add monitors with the Synthetics REST API. For example, you can create a GET request to the monitor you want to use as the source for configuration, then use those key values to use in a POST to \"copy\" and create a new monitor. Edit a monitor You cannot change a monitor's type after the monitor is created, but you can edit other monitor settings. From the Monitors tab in one.newrelic.com > Synthetics, select the monitor you want to edit. In the side menu, select a link to change the following settings: Select Settings > General to edit name, Apdex T, URL, locations, frequency, and advanced options. For Scripted browser and API test monitors, select Settings > Script to edit your monitor script. For synthetic monitoring alerts, click Manage alerts. Select Save changes to confirm. Delete a monitor You must have Admin privileges in order to delete a monitor. To delete a monitor: From the Monitors tab in one.newrelic.com > Synthetics, select the monitor you want to edit. From the selected monitor, select Settings > General. Scroll to the bottom of the page and select the trash can icon. Tip You can also delete a monitor with the Synthetics REST API. Monitor settings When configuring monitors, the following settings are available: Type Select the type of monitor you want to create. A monitor's type can't be changed after the monitor is created. Ping: Specify a single URL to monitor for availability. New Relic will check this URL via HEAD or GET requests. The non-configurable timeout for this monitor is 60 seconds. Simple browser: Specify a single URL to monitor via real browser. Once each frequency interval, New Relic will check this URL via a Selenium-powered Google Chrome browser. The non-configurable timeout for this monitor is 60 seconds. Scripted browser: Create a script to drive a Selenium-powered Google Chrome browser. The browser follows each step in the script to verify that complex behavior is working as expected (for example, searching a website, then clicking one of the search results). The non-configurable timeout for this monitor is 180 seconds. API test: Create an API script to ensure your API endpoint is working correctly. For more information, see Write API tests. The non-configurable timeout for this monitor is 180 seconds. Monitor name Defines a name for the monitor. Monitor names cannot contain unencoded angle brackets (< >). To include angle brackets in a monitor name, encode them as HTML bracket entities (&lt; &gt;) in the UI or API. Location Select the locations where you want your monitor to run. Select more locations to ensure that your application is available to users around the world. If you have any private locations, they will be listed here too. You can use the Synthetics API location endpoint to retrieve a list of valid locations for your account. Your monitor will run one check from each selected location during each frequency interval. For example, if you select three locations and define a frequency of 15 minutes, your monitor will run three checks in each 15 minute period (or 8,640 checks per month). Frequency Select how often the monitor runs, in increments of minutes, hours, or 1 day. This frequency applies to each location. For example, if you select three locations and a Frequency of 15 minutes, your monitor will run three checks, on average every 5 minutes, in each 15 minute period (or 8,640 checks per month). Alerts Specify an email address to receive alerts when a monitor fails. Or, attach a monitor to an existing alert policy for more notification options. For more information, see Alerting for synthetic monitoring. Apdex T Customize the Apdex T for this monitor. This setting is only available when editing the settings for an existing monitor, not when creating a new monitor. Change the Apdex T from the default 7 seconds for more accurate Apdex scores in your SLA reports. For example, if you have a very long scripted browser, you might adjust the Apdex T to 15 seconds to more closely reflect the usual completion time. Similarly, a good Apdex T for a simple browser check might be only 2 seconds. Response Validation (optional) Specify text to search for on the page. When using simple browser or ping monitor types, there is a 1MB (10^6 bytes) limit on the page load. See a history of monitor changes You can use New Relic One to see a history of recent changes to synthetic monitors and what users changed them.",

They can also: Capture aggregate numbers, including an overview or summary for ping monitors. Provide detailed statistics for each page resource, and downtime incidents. Collect custom response codes for more detail on your monitor runs. You'll be able to add and configure synthetic monitors to suit your environnment after you create a New Relic account. (It's free, forever!) Add a monitor You can add several types of synthetic monitors: Ping monitors ensure your website is responding, while simple browser monitors send real browsers to check your website. For more complex monitoring, scripted browser monitors verify that specific resources are present, while API tests verify your API endpoint. The default timeout for a new monitor is 180 seconds. To learn how to use our step monitor to build complex workflow validation scripts without writing any code, watch this short YouTube video (approx. 3:20 minutes). Add a ping or simple browser monitor Go to one.newrelic.com > Synthetics > Create monitor. Specify a monitor type, name, and URL (may be any valid HTTP or HTTPS URL). Optional: Add a validation string or Advanced options: A validation string is available for ping and simple browser. This option enables substring monitoring for response validation. Verify SSL is available for ping and simple browser. This option verifies the validity of the SSL certificate chain. It can be duplicated by running the following syntax: openssl s_client -servername {YOUR_HOSTNAME} -connect {YOUR_HOSTNAME}:443 -CApath /etc/ssl/certs -verify_hostname {YOUR_HOSTNAME} > /dev/null Copy If a non-zero exit code is returned, the monitor will fail. The Bypass HEAD request option is available for ping. This option skips the default HEAD request and instead uses the GET verb with a ping check. Redirect is Failure is available for ping. If a redirect result occurs when Redirect is Failure is enabled, New Relic Synthetics will categorize the result as a failure, rather than following the redirect and checking the resulting URL. Select the locations from which you want your monitor to run. Choose a frequency to determine how often each location will run your monitor. Optional: Set up alert notifications. Select Create my monitor to confirm. Generate some traffic and wait a few minutes, then check your monitor from the Monitors index. Add a scripted browser or API test monitor Go to one.newrelic.com > Synthetics > Create monitor. Specify a monitor type and name. Select the locations from which you want your monitor to run. Choose a frequency to determine how often each location will run your monitor. Optional: Set up alert notifications. Select Next: Write your script to create a script for your scripted browser or API test, then select Validate to verify your syntax. Tip For complex scripts, validation may take up to one minute. Select Create my monitor to confirm. Generate some traffic and wait a few minutes, then check your monitor from the Monitors index. Add a step monitor Go to one.newrelic.com > Synthetics > Create monitor. Select step monitor as the monitor type. Specify a name and choose a frequency to determine how often each location will run your monitor. Select the locations from which you want your monitor to run. Build your monitor by selecting from the preconfigured steps at the bottom of the UI: Navigate to a URL Type text Click an element Assert text Assert an element Secure a credential Use the instructions on the right side of the UI to help locate elements by CSS class, HTML ID, link text, or XPath. Select Save monitor to confirm. Generate some traffic and wait a few minutes, then check your monitor from the Monitors index. Add a certificate check monitor Go to one.newrelic.com > Synthetics > Create monitor. Select the certificate check monitor type. Specify a name and enter the domain you'd like to monitor. Enter the number of days it takes for your certificate to expire. Select the period to determine your monitor's frequency. Optional: Add tags to help you find this monitor later. Select the locations from which you want your monitor to run, and then click Save monitor to confirm. Generate some traffic and wait a few minutes, then check your monitor from the Monitors index. Add a broken links monitor Go to one.newrelic.com > Synthetics > Create monitor. Select the broken links check monitor type. Specify a name and enter the URL you'd like to monitor (may be any valid HTTP or HTTPS URL). Select the period to determine your monitor's frequency. Optional: Add tags to help you find this monitor later. Select the locations from which you want your monitor to run, and then click Save monitor to confirm. Generate some traffic and wait a few minutes, then check your monitor from the Monitors index. Tip You can also add monitors with the Synthetics REST API. For example, you can create a GET request to the monitor you want to use as the source for configuration, then use those key values to use in a POST to \"copy\" and create a new monitor. Edit a monitor You cannot change a monitor's type after the monitor is created, but you can edit other monitor settings. From the Monitors tab in one.newrelic.com > Synthetics, select the monitor you want to edit. In the side menu, select a link to change the following settings: Select Settings > General to edit name, Apdex T, URL, locations, frequency, and advanced options. For Scripted browser and API test monitors, select Settings > Script to edit your monitor script. For synthetic monitoring alerts, click Manage alerts. Select Save changes to confirm. Delete a monitor You must have Admin privileges in order to delete a monitor. To delete a monitor: From the Monitors tab in one.newrelic.com > Synthetics, select the monitor you want to edit. From the selected monitor, select Settings > General. Scroll to the bottom of the page and select the trash can icon. Tip You can also delete a monitor with the Synthetics REST API. Monitor settings When configuring monitors, the following settings are available: Type Select the type of monitor you want to create. A monitor's type can't be changed after the monitor is created. Ping: Specify a single URL to monitor for availability. New Relic will check this URL via HEAD or GET requests. The non-configurable timeout for this monitor is 60 seconds. Simple browser: Specify a single URL to monitor via real browser. Once each frequency interval, New Relic will check this URL via a Selenium-powered Google Chrome browser. The non-configurable timeout for this monitor is 60 seconds. Scripted browser: Create a script to drive a Selenium-powered Google Chrome browser. The browser follows each step in the script to verify that complex behavior is working as expected (for example, searching a website, then clicking one of the search results). The non-configurable timeout for this monitor is 180 seconds. API test: Create an API script to ensure your API endpoint is working correctly. For more information, see Write API tests. The non-configurable timeout for this monitor is 180 seconds. Monitor name Defines a name for the monitor. Monitor names cannot contain unencoded angle brackets (< >). To include angle brackets in a monitor name, encode them as HTML bracket entities (&lt; &gt;) in the UI or API. Location Select the locations where you want your monitor to run. Select more locations to ensure that your application is available to users around the world. If you have any private locations, they will be listed here too. You can use the Synthetics API location endpoint to retrieve a list of valid locations for your account. Your monitor will run one check from each selected location during each frequency interval. For example, if you select three locations and define a frequency of 15 minutes, your monitor will run three checks in each 15 minute period (or 8,640 checks per month). Frequency Select how often the monitor runs, in increments of minutes, hours, or 1 day. This frequency applies to each location. For example, if you select three locations and a Frequency of 15 minutes, your monitor will run three checks, on average every 5 minutes, in each 15 minute period (or 8,640 checks per month). Alerts Specify an email address to receive alerts when a monitor fails. Or, attach a monitor to an existing alert policy for more notification options. For more information, see Alerting for synthetic monitoring. Apdex T Customize the Apdex T for this monitor. This setting is only available when editing the settings for an existing monitor, not when creating a new monitor. Change the Apdex T from the default 7 seconds for more accurate Apdex scores in your SLA reports. For example, if you have a very long scripted browser, you might adjust the Apdex T to 15 seconds to more closely reflect the usual completion time. Similarly, a good Apdex T for a simple browser check might be only 2 seconds. Response Validation (optional) Specify text to search for on the page. When using simple browser or ping monitor types, there is a 1MB (10^6 bytes) limit on the page load.

      "body": "You can proactively monitor your website or API endpoints with synthetic monitors. Depending on the type of monitor, you can: Add and edit monitors. Use the Synthetics REST API to manage monitors. Set up monitors from specific locations or for private servers. You can also use the host not reporting feature in infrastructure monitoring. This allows you to take advantage of enhanced monitoring options and be notified when New Relic has stopped receiving data from your hosts. Types of monitors These are the seven types of synthetic monitors: Type of synthetic monitor Description Broken links monitor API name: SCRIPT_API Provide a url and this monitor will test all the links on the page for success. If a failure is detected you can view the individual non-successful links that caused the failure. Certificate check monitor API name: SCRIPT_API Proactively ping your domain certificates based on a configurable threshold. Pair with an alert to ensure you are notified when your certificates need renewed. Ping monitor API name: SIMPLE Ping monitors are the simplest type of monitor. They simply check to see if an application is online. The synthetic ping monitor uses a simple Java HTTP client to make requests to your site. For consistency with other synthetic monitor types, the user agent is identified as Google Chrome. However, the HTTP client is not a full browser, and it does not execute JavaScript. If you need JavaScript functionality, use a simple browser monitor. Step monitor API name: STEP_MONITOR Step monitors are advanced monitors which require no code to set up. The monitor can be configured to: Assert modal Assert text Assert title Assert an element Click an element Dismiss a modal Double click an element Enter a secure credential Hover over an element Locate an element by CSS class, HTML ID, link text, Xpath, or value Navigate to a URL Select from a dropdown Type text Simple browser monitors API name: BROWSER Simple browser monitors essentially are simple, pre-built scripted browser monitors. They make a request to your site using an instance of Google Chrome. Compared to a simple ping monitor, this is a more accurate emulation of an actual customer visit. The user agent is identified as Google Chrome. Scripted browser monitors API name: SCRIPT_BROWSER Scripted browser monitors are used for more sophisticated, customized monitoring. You can create a custom script that navigates your website, takes specific actions, and ensures specific resources are present. The monitor uses Google Chrome browser. You can also use a variety of third-party modules to build your custom monitor. API tests API name: SCRIPT_API API tests are used to monitor your API endpoints. This can ensure that your app server works in addition to your website. New Relic uses the http-request module internally to make HTTP calls to your endpoint and validate the results. You can add and edit synthetic monitors directly in our UI. You can also create some synthetic monitors with Terraform. To learn how, watch this short YouTube video (approx. 3:25 minutes).",

Use the Synthetics REST API to manage monitors. Set up monitors from specific locations or for private servers. You can also use the host not reporting feature in infrastructure monitoring. This allows you to take advantage of enhanced monitoring options and be notified when New Relic has stopped receiving data from your hosts. Types of monitors These are the seven types of synthetic monitors: Type of synthetic monitor Description Broken links monitor API name: SCRIPT_API Provide a url and this monitor will test all the links on the page for success. If a failure is detected you can view the individual non-successful links that caused the failure. Certificate check monitor API name: SCRIPT_API Proactively ping your domain certificates based on a configurable threshold. Pair with an alert to ensure you are notified when your certificates need renewed. Ping monitor API name: SIMPLE Ping monitors are the simplest type of monitor. They simply check to see if an application is online. The synthetic ping monitor uses a simple Java HTTP client to make requests to your site. For consistency with other synthetic monitor types, the user agent is identified as Google Chrome. However, the HTTP client is not a full browser, and it does not execute JavaScript. If you need JavaScript functionality, use a simple browser monitor. Step monitor API name: STEP_MONITOR Step monitors are advanced monitors which require no code to set up. The monitor can be configured to: Assert modal Assert text Assert title Assert an element Click an element Dismiss a modal Double click an element Enter a secure credential Hover over an element Locate an element by CSS class, HTML ID, link text, Xpath, or value Navigate to a URL Select from a dropdown Type text Simple browser monitors API name: BROWSER Simple browser monitors essentially are simple, pre-built scripted browser monitors. They make a request to your site using an instance of Google Chrome. Compared to a simple ping monitor, this is a more accurate emulation of an actual customer visit. The user agent is identified as Google Chrome. Scripted browser monitors API name: SCRIPT_BROWSER Scripted browser monitors are used for more sophisticated, customized monitoring. You can create a custom script that navigates your website, takes specific actions, and ensures specific resources are present. The monitor uses Google Chrome browser. You can also use a variety of third-party modules to build your custom monitor. API tests API name: SCRIPT_API API tests are used to monitor your API endpoints. This can ensure that your app server works in addition to your website. New Relic uses the http-request module internally to make HTTP calls to your endpoint and validate the results. You can add and edit synthetic monitors directly in our UI. You can also create some synthetic monitors with Terraform. To learn how, watch this short YouTube video (approx. 3:25 minutes).",

Collect custom response codes for more detail on your monitor runs. You'll be able to add and configure synthetic monitors to suit your environnment after you create a New Relic account. (It's free, forever!) Add a monitor You can add several types of synthetic monitors: Ping monitors ensure your website is responding, while simple browser monitors send real browsers to check your website. For more complex monitoring, scripted browser monitors verify that specific resources are present, while API tests verify your API endpoint. The default timeout for a new monitor is 180 seconds. To learn how to use our step monitor to build complex workflow validation scripts without writing any code, watch this short YouTube video (approx. 3:20 minutes). Add a ping or simple browser monitor Go to one.newrelic.com > Synthetics > Create monitor. Specify a monitor type, name, and URL (may be any valid HTTP or HTTPS URL). Optional: Add a validation string or Advanced options: A validation string is available for ping and simple browser. This option enables substring monitoring for response validation. Verify SSL is available for ping and simple browser. This option verifies the validity of the SSL certificate chain. It can be duplicated by running the following syntax: openssl s_client -servername {YOUR_HOSTNAME} -connect {YOUR_HOSTNAME}:443 -CApath /etc/ssl/certs -verify_hostname {YOUR_HOSTNAME} > /dev/null Copy If a non-zero exit code is returned, the monitor will fail. The Bypass HEAD request option is available for ping. This option skips the default HEAD request and instead uses the GET verb with a ping check. Redirect is Failure is available for ping. If a redirect result occurs when Redirect is Failure is enabled, New Relic Synthetics will categorize the result as a failure, rather than following the redirect and checking the resulting URL. Select the locations from which you want your monitor to run. Choose a frequency to determine how often each location will run your monitor. Optional: Set up alert notifications. Select Create my monitor to confirm. Generate some traffic and wait a few minutes, then check your monitor from the Monitors index. Add a scripted browser or API test monitor Go to one.newrelic.com > Synthetics > Create monitor. Specify a monitor type and name. Select the locations from which you want your monitor to run. Choose a frequency to determine how often each location will run your monitor. Optional: Set up alert notifications. Select Next: Write your script to create a script for your scripted browser or API test, then select Validate to verify your syntax. Tip For complex scripts, validation may take up to one minute. Select Create my monitor to confirm. Generate some traffic and wait a few minutes, then check your monitor from the Monitors index. Add a step monitor Go to one.newrelic.com > Synthetics > Create monitor. Select step monitor as the monitor type. Specify a name and choose a frequency to determine how often each location will run your monitor. Select the locations from which you want your monitor to run. Build your monitor by selecting from the preconfigured steps at the bottom of the UI: Navigate to a URL Type text Click an element Assert text Assert an element Secure a credential Use the instructions on the right side of the UI to help locate elements by CSS class, HTML ID, link text, or XPath. Select Save monitor to confirm. Generate some traffic and wait a few minutes, then check your monitor from the Monitors index. Add a certificate check monitor Go to one.newrelic.com > Synthetics > Create monitor. Select the certificate check monitor type. Specify a name and enter the domain you'd like to monitor. Enter the number of days it takes for your certificate to expire. Select the period to determine your monitor's frequency. Optional: Add tags to help you find this monitor later. Select the locations from which you want your monitor to run, and then click Save monitor to confirm. Generate some traffic and wait a few minutes, then check your monitor from the Monitors index. Add a broken links monitor Go to one.newrelic.com > Synthetics > Create monitor. Select the broken links check monitor type. Specify a name and enter the URL you'd like to monitor (may be any valid HTTP or HTTPS URL). Select the period to determine your monitor's frequency. Optional: Add tags to help you find this monitor later. Select the locations from which you want your monitor to run, and then click Save monitor to confirm. Generate some traffic and wait a few minutes, then check your monitor from the Monitors index. Tip You can also add monitors with the Synthetics REST API. For example, you can create a GET request to the monitor you want to use as the source for configuration, then use those key values to use in a POST to \"copy\" and create a new monitor. Edit a monitor You cannot change a monitor's type after the monitor is created, but you can edit other monitor settings. From the Monitors tab in one.newrelic.com > Synthetics, select the monitor you want to edit. In the side menu, select a link to change the following settings: Select Settings > General to edit name, Apdex T, URL, locations, frequency, and advanced options. For Scripted browser and API test monitors, select Settings > Script to edit your monitor script. For synthetic monitoring alerts, click Manage alerts. Select Save changes to confirm. Delete a monitor You must have Admin privileges in order to delete a monitor. To delete a monitor: From the Monitors tab in one.newrelic.com > Synthetics, select the monitor you want to edit. From the selected monitor, select Settings > General. Scroll to the bottom of the page and select the trash can icon. Tip You can also delete a monitor with the Synthetics REST API. Monitor settings When configuring monitors, the following settings are available: Type Select the type of monitor you want to create. A monitor's type can't be changed after the monitor is created. Ping: Specify a single URL to monitor for availability. New Relic will check this URL via HEAD or GET requests. The non-configurable timeout for this monitor is 60 seconds. Simple browser: Specify a single URL to monitor via real browser. Once each frequency interval, New Relic will check this URL via a Selenium-powered Google Chrome browser. The non-configurable timeout for this monitor is 60 seconds. Scripted browser: Create a script to drive a Selenium-powered Google Chrome browser. The browser follows each step in the script to verify that complex behavior is working as expected (for example, searching a website, then clicking one of the search results). The non-configurable timeout for this monitor is 180 seconds. API test: Create an API script to ensure your API endpoint is working correctly. For more information, see Write API tests. The non-configurable timeout for this monitor is 180 seconds. Monitor name Defines a name for the monitor. Monitor names cannot contain unencoded angle brackets (< >). To include angle brackets in a monitor name, encode them as HTML bracket entities (&lt; &gt;) in the UI or API. Location Select the locations where you want your monitor to run. Select more locations to ensure that your application is available to users around the world. If you have any private locations, they will be listed here too. You can use the Synthetics API location endpoint to retrieve a list of valid locations for your account. Your monitor will run one check from each selected location during each frequency interval. For example, if you select three locations and define a frequency of 15 minutes, your monitor will run three checks in each 15 minute period (or 8,640 checks per month). Frequency Select how often the monitor runs, in increments of minutes, hours, or 1 day. This frequency applies to each location. For example, if you select three locations and a Frequency of 15 minutes, your monitor will run three checks, on average every 5 minutes, in each 15 minute period (or 8,640 checks per month). Alerts Specify an email address to receive alerts when a monitor fails. Or, attach a monitor to an existing alert policy for more notification options. For more information, see Alerting for synthetic monitoring. Apdex T Customize the Apdex T for this monitor. This setting is only available when editing the settings for an existing monitor, not when creating a new monitor. Change the Apdex T from the default 7 seconds for more accurate Apdex scores in your SLA reports. For example, if you have a very long scripted browser, you might adjust the Apdex T to 15 seconds to more closely reflect the usual completion time. Similarly, a good Apdex T for a simple browser check might be only 2 seconds. Response Validation (optional) Specify text to search for on the page. When using simple browser or ping monitor types, there is a 1MB (10^6 bytes) limit on the page load. See a history of monitor changes You can use New Relic One to see a history of recent changes to synthetic monitors and what users changed them.",

In the side menu, select a link to change the following settings: Select Settings > General to edit name, Apdex T, URL, locations, frequency, and advanced options. For Scripted browser and API test monitors, select Settings > Script to edit your monitor script. For synthetic monitoring alerts, click Manage alerts. Select Save changes to confirm. Delete a monitor You must have Admin privileges in order to delete a monitor. To delete a monitor: From the Monitors tab in one.newrelic.com > Synthetics, select the monitor you want to edit. From the selected monitor, select Settings > General. Scroll to the bottom of the page and select the trash can icon. Tip You can also delete a monitor with the Synthetics REST API. Monitor settings When configuring monitors, the following settings are available: Type Select the type of monitor you want to create. A monitor's type can't be changed after the monitor is created. Ping: Specify a single URL to monitor for availability. New Relic will check this URL via HEAD or GET requests. The non-configurable timeout for this monitor is 60 seconds. Simple browser: Specify a single URL to monitor via real browser. Once each frequency interval, New Relic will check this URL via a Selenium-powered Google Chrome browser. The non-configurable timeout for this monitor is 60 seconds. Scripted browser: Create a script to drive a Selenium-powered Google Chrome browser. The browser follows each step in the script to verify that complex behavior is working as expected (for example, searching a website, then clicking one of the search results). The non-configurable timeout for this monitor is 180 seconds. API test: Create an API script to ensure your API endpoint is working correctly. For more information, see Write API tests. The non-configurable timeout for this monitor is 180 seconds. Monitor name Defines a name for the monitor. Monitor names cannot contain unencoded angle brackets (< >). To include angle brackets in a monitor name, encode them as HTML bracket entities (&lt; &gt;) in the UI or API. Location Select the locations where you want your monitor to run. Select more locations to ensure that your application is available to users around the world. If you have any private locations, they will be listed here too. You can use the Synthetics API location endpoint to retrieve a list of valid locations for your account. Your monitor will run one check from each selected location during each frequency interval. For example, if you select three locations and define a frequency of 15 minutes, your monitor will run three checks in each 15 minute period (or 8,640 checks per month). Frequency Select how often the monitor runs, in increments of minutes, hours, or 1 day. This frequency applies to each location. For example, if you select three locations and a Frequency of 15 minutes, your monitor will run three checks, on average every 5 minutes, in each 15 minute period (or 8,640 checks per month). Alerts Specify an email address to receive alerts when a monitor fails. Or, attach a monitor to an existing alert policy for more notification options. For more information, see Alerting for synthetic monitoring. Apdex T Customize the Apdex T for this monitor. This setting is only available when editing the settings for an existing monitor, not when creating a new monitor. Change the Apdex T from the default 7 seconds for more accurate Apdex scores in your SLA reports. For example, if you have a very long scripted browser, you might adjust the Apdex T to 15 seconds to more closely reflect the usual completion time. Similarly, a good Apdex T for a simple browser check might be only 2 seconds. Response Validation (optional) Specify text to search for on the page. When using simple browser or ping monitor types, there is a 1MB (10^6 bytes) limit on the page load. See a history of monitor changes You can use New Relic One to see a history of recent changes to synthetic monitors and what users changed them.",

Use the Synthetics REST API to manage monitors. Set up monitors from specific locations or for private servers. You can also use the host not reporting feature in infrastructure monitoring. This allows you to take advantage of enhanced monitoring options and be notified when New Relic has stopped receiving data from your hosts. Types of monitors These are the seven types of synthetic monitors: Type of synthetic monitor Description Broken links monitor API name: SCRIPT_API Provide a url and this monitor will test all the links on the page for success. If a failure is detected you can view the individual non-successful links that caused the failure. Certificate check monitor API name: SCRIPT_API Proactively ping your domain certificates based on a configurable threshold. Pair with an alert to ensure you are notified when your certificates need renewed. Ping monitor API name: SIMPLE Ping monitors are the simplest type of monitor. They simply check to see if an application is online. The synthetic ping monitor uses a simple Java HTTP client to make requests to your site. For consistency with other synthetic monitor types, the user agent is identified as Google Chrome. However, the HTTP client is not a full browser, and it does not execute JavaScript. If you need JavaScript functionality, use a simple browser monitor. Step monitor API name: STEP_MONITOR Step monitors are advanced monitors which require no code to set up. The monitor can be configured to: Assert modal Assert text Assert title Assert an element Click an element Dismiss a modal Double click an element Enter a secure credential Hover over an element Locate an element by CSS class, HTML ID, link text, Xpath, or value Navigate to a URL Select from a dropdown Type text Simple browser monitors API name: BROWSER Simple browser monitors essentially are simple, pre-built scripted browser monitors. They make a request to your site using an instance of Google Chrome. Compared to a simple ping monitor, this is a more accurate emulation of an actual customer visit. The user agent is identified as Google Chrome. Scripted browser monitors API name: SCRIPT_BROWSER Scripted browser monitors are used for more sophisticated, customized monitoring. You can create a custom script that navigates your website, takes specific actions, and ensures specific resources are present. The monitor uses Google Chrome browser. You can also use a variety of third-party modules to build your custom monitor. API tests API name: SCRIPT_API API tests are used to monitor your API endpoints. This can ensure that your app server works in addition to your website. New Relic uses the http-request module internally to make HTTP calls to your endpoint and validate the results. You can add and edit synthetic monitors directly in our UI. You can also create some synthetic monitors with Terraform. To learn how, watch this short YouTube video (approx. 3:25 minutes).",

      "body": "Synthetic monitors are API checks or virtual browser instances that monitor your website, recording each check in detail. They can also: Capture aggregate numbers, including an overview or summary for ping monitors. Provide detailed statistics for each page resource, and downtime incidents. Collect custom response codes for more detail on your monitor runs. You'll be able to add and configure synthetic monitors to suit your environnment after you create a New Relic account. (It's free, forever!) Add a monitor You can add several types of synthetic monitors: Ping monitors ensure your website is responding, while simple browser monitors send real browsers to check your website. For more complex monitoring, scripted browser monitors verify that specific resources are present, while API tests verify your API endpoint. The default timeout for a new monitor is 180 seconds. To learn how to use our step monitor to build complex workflow validation scripts without writing any code, watch this short YouTube video (approx. 3:20 minutes). Add a ping or simple browser monitor Go to one.newrelic.com > Synthetics > Create monitor. Specify a monitor type, name, and URL (may be any valid HTTP or HTTPS URL). Optional: Add a validation string or Advanced options: A validation string is available for ping and simple browser. This option enables substring monitoring for response validation. Verify SSL is available for ping and simple browser. This option verifies the validity of the SSL certificate chain. It can be duplicated by running the following syntax: openssl s_client -servername {YOUR_HOSTNAME} -connect {YOUR_HOSTNAME}:443 -CApath /etc/ssl/certs -verify_hostname {YOUR_HOSTNAME} > /dev/null Copy If a non-zero exit code is returned, the monitor will fail. The Bypass HEAD request option is available for ping. This option skips the default HEAD request and instead uses the GET verb with a ping check. Redirect is Failure is available for ping. If a redirect result occurs when Redirect is Failure is enabled, New Relic Synthetics will categorize the result as a failure, rather than following the redirect and checking the resulting URL. Select the locations from which you want your monitor to run. Choose a frequency to determine how often each location will run your monitor. Optional: Set up alert notifications. Select Create my monitor to confirm. Generate some traffic and wait a few minutes, then check your monitor from the Monitors index. Add a scripted browser or API test monitor Go to one.newrelic.com > Synthetics > Create monitor. Specify a monitor type and name. Select the locations from which you want your monitor to run. Choose a frequency to determine how often each location will run your monitor. Optional: Set up alert notifications. Select Next: Write your script to create a script for your scripted browser or API test, then select Validate to verify your syntax. Tip For complex scripts, validation may take up to one minute. Select Create my monitor to confirm. Generate some traffic and wait a few minutes, then check your monitor from the Monitors index. Add a step monitor Go to one.newrelic.com > Synthetics > Create monitor. Select step monitor as the monitor type. Specify a name and choose a frequency to determine how often each location will run your monitor. Select the locations from which you want your monitor to run. Build your monitor by selecting from the preconfigured steps at the bottom of the UI: Navigate to a URL Type text Click an element Assert text Assert an element Secure a credential Use the instructions on the right side of the UI to help locate elements by CSS class, HTML ID, link text, or XPath. Select Save monitor to confirm. Generate some traffic and wait a few minutes, then check your monitor from the Monitors index. Add a certificate check monitor Go to one.newrelic.com > Synthetics > Create monitor. Select the certificate check monitor type. Specify a name and enter the domain you'd like to monitor. Enter the number of days it takes for your certificate to expire. Select the period to determine your monitor's frequency. Optional: Add tags to help you find this monitor later. Select the locations from which you want your monitor to run, and then click Save monitor to confirm. Generate some traffic and wait a few minutes, then check your monitor from the Monitors index. Add a broken links monitor Go to one.newrelic.com > Synthetics > Create monitor. Select the broken links check monitor type. Specify a name and enter the URL you'd like to monitor (may be any valid HTTP or HTTPS URL). Select the period to determine your monitor's frequency. Optional: Add tags to help you find this monitor later. Select the locations from which you want your monitor to run, and then click Save monitor to confirm. Generate some traffic and wait a few minutes, then check your monitor from the Monitors index. Tip You can also add monitors with the Synthetics REST API. For example, you can create a GET request to the monitor you want to use as the source for configuration, then use those key values to use in a POST to \"copy\" and create a new monitor. Edit a monitor You cannot change a monitor's type after the monitor is created, but you can edit other monitor settings. From the Monitors tab in one.newrelic.com > Synthetics, select the monitor you want to edit. In the side menu, select a link to change the following settings: Select Settings > General to edit name, Apdex T, URL, locations, frequency, and advanced options. For Scripted browser and API test monitors, select Settings > Script to edit your monitor script. For synthetic monitoring alerts, click Manage alerts. Select Save changes to confirm. Delete a monitor You must have Admin privileges in order to delete a monitor. To delete a monitor: From the Monitors tab in one.newrelic.com > Synthetics, select the monitor you want to edit. From the selected monitor, select Settings > General. Scroll to the bottom of the page and select the trash can icon. Tip You can also delete a monitor with the Synthetics REST API. Monitor settings When configuring monitors, the following settings are available: Type Select the type of monitor you want to create. A monitor's type can't be changed after the monitor is created. Ping: Specify a single URL to monitor for availability. New Relic will check this URL via HEAD or GET requests. The non-configurable timeout for this monitor is 60 seconds. Simple browser: Specify a single URL to monitor via real browser. Once each frequency interval, New Relic will check this URL via a Selenium-powered Google Chrome browser. The non-configurable timeout for this monitor is 60 seconds. Scripted browser: Create a script to drive a Selenium-powered Google Chrome browser. The browser follows each step in the script to verify that complex behavior is working as expected (for example, searching a website, then clicking one of the search results). The non-configurable timeout for this monitor is 180 seconds. API test: Create an API script to ensure your API endpoint is working correctly. For more information, see Write API tests. The non-configurable timeout for this monitor is 180 seconds. Monitor name Defines a name for the monitor. Monitor names cannot contain unencoded angle brackets (< >). To include angle brackets in a monitor name, encode them as HTML bracket entities (&lt; &gt;) in the UI or API. Location Select the locations where you want your monitor to run. Select more locations to ensure that your application is available to users around the world. If you have any private locations, they will be listed here too. You can use the Synthetics API location endpoint to retrieve a list of valid locations for your account. Your monitor will run one check from each selected location during each frequency interval. For example, if you select three locations and define a frequency of 15 minutes, your monitor will run three checks in each 15 minute period (or 8,640 checks per month). Frequency Select how often the monitor runs, in increments of minutes, hours, or 1 day. This frequency applies to each location. For example, if you select three locations and a Frequency of 15 minutes, your monitor will run three checks, on average every 5 minutes, in each 15 minute period (or 8,640 checks per month). Alerts Specify an email address to receive alerts when a monitor fails. Or, attach a monitor to an existing alert policy for more notification options. For more information, see Alerting for synthetic monitoring. Apdex T Customize the Apdex T for this monitor. This setting is only available when editing the settings for an existing monitor, not when creating a new monitor. Change the Apdex T from the default 7 seconds for more accurate Apdex scores in your SLA reports. For example, if you have a very long scripted browser, you might adjust the Apdex T to 15 seconds to more closely reflect the usual completion time. Similarly, a good Apdex T for a simple browser check might be only 2 seconds. Response Validation (optional) Specify text to search for on the page. When using simple browser or ping monitor types, there is a 1MB (10^6 bytes) limit on the page load.

Use the Synthetics REST API to manage monitors. Set up monitors from specific locations or for private servers. You can also use the host not reporting feature in infrastructure monitoring. This allows you to take advantage of enhanced monitoring options and be notified when New Relic has stopped receiving data from your hosts. Types of monitors These are the seven types of synthetic monitors: Type of synthetic monitor Description Broken links monitor API name: SCRIPT_API Provide a url and this monitor will test all the links on the page for success. If a failure is detected you can view the individual non-successful links that caused the failure. Certificate check monitor API name: SCRIPT_API Proactively ping your domain certificates based on a configurable threshold. Pair with an alert to ensure you are notified when your certificates need renewed. Ping monitor API name: SIMPLE Ping monitors are the simplest type of monitor. They simply check to see if an application is online. The synthetic ping monitor uses a simple Java HTTP client to make requests to your site. For consistency with other synthetic monitor types, the user agent is identified as Google Chrome. However, the HTTP client is not a full browser, and it does not execute JavaScript. If you need JavaScript functionality, use a simple browser monitor. Step monitor API name: STEP_MONITOR Step monitors are advanced monitors which require no code to set up. The monitor can be configured to: Assert modal Assert text Assert title Assert an element Click an element Dismiss a modal Double click an element Enter a secure credential Hover over an element Locate an element by CSS class, HTML ID, link text, Xpath, or value Navigate to a URL Select from a dropdown Type text Simple browser monitors API name: BROWSER Simple browser monitors essentially are simple, pre-built scripted browser monitors. They make a request to your site using an instance of Google Chrome. Compared to a simple ping monitor, this is a more accurate emulation of an actual customer visit. The user agent is identified as Google Chrome. Scripted browser monitors API name: SCRIPT_BROWSER Scripted browser monitors are used for more sophisticated, customized monitoring. You can create a custom script that navigates your website, takes specific actions, and ensures specific resources are present. The monitor uses Google Chrome browser. You can also use a variety of third-party modules to build your custom monitor. API tests API name: SCRIPT_API API tests are used to monitor your API endpoints. This can ensure that your app server works in addition to your website. New Relic uses the http-request module internally to make HTTP calls to your endpoint and validate the results. You can add and edit synthetic monitors directly in our UI. You can also create some synthetic monitors with Terraform. To learn how, watch this short YouTube video (approx. 3:25 minutes).",

They can also: Capture aggregate numbers, including an overview or summary for ping monitors. Provide detailed statistics for each page resource, and downtime incidents. Collect custom response codes for more detail on your monitor runs. You'll be able to add and configure synthetic monitors to suit your environnment after you create a New Relic account. (It's free, forever!) Add a monitor You can add several types of synthetic monitors: Ping monitors ensure your website is responding, while simple browser monitors send real browsers to check your website. For more complex monitoring, scripted browser monitors verify that specific resources are present, while API tests verify your API endpoint. The default timeout for a new monitor is 180 seconds. To learn how to use our step monitor to build complex workflow validation scripts without writing any code, watch this short YouTube video (approx. 3:20 minutes). Add a ping or simple browser monitor Go to one.newrelic.com > Synthetics > Create monitor. Specify a monitor type, name, and URL (may be any valid HTTP or HTTPS URL). Optional: Add a validation string or Advanced options: A validation string is available for ping and simple browser. This option enables substring monitoring for response validation. Verify SSL is available for ping and simple browser. This option verifies the validity of the SSL certificate chain. It can be duplicated by running the following syntax: openssl s_client -servername {YOUR_HOSTNAME} -connect {YOUR_HOSTNAME}:443 -CApath /etc/ssl/certs -verify_hostname {YOUR_HOSTNAME} > /dev/null Copy If a non-zero exit code is returned, the monitor will fail. The Bypass HEAD request option is available for ping. This option skips the default HEAD request and instead uses the GET verb with a ping check. Redirect is Failure is available for ping. If a redirect result occurs when Redirect is Failure is enabled, New Relic Synthetics will categorize the result as a failure, rather than following the redirect and checking the resulting URL. Select the locations from which you want your monitor to run. Choose a frequency to determine how often each location will run your monitor. Optional: Set up alert notifications. Select Create my monitor to confirm. Generate some traffic and wait a few minutes, then check your monitor from the Monitors index. Add a scripted browser or API test monitor Go to one.newrelic.com > Synthetics > Create monitor. Specify a monitor type and name. Select the locations from which you want your monitor to run. Choose a frequency to determine how often each location will run your monitor. Optional: Set up alert notifications. Select Next: Write your script to create a script for your scripted browser or API test, then select Validate to verify your syntax. Tip For complex scripts, validation may take up to one minute. Select Create my monitor to confirm. Generate some traffic and wait a few minutes, then check your monitor from the Monitors index. Add a step monitor Go to one.newrelic.com > Synthetics > Create monitor. Select step monitor as the monitor type. Specify a name and choose a frequency to determine how often each location will run your monitor. Select the locations from which you want your monitor to run. Build your monitor by selecting from the preconfigured steps at the bottom of the UI: Navigate to a URL Type text Click an element Assert text Assert an element Secure a credential Use the instructions on the right side of the UI to help locate elements by CSS class, HTML ID, link text, or XPath. Select Save monitor to confirm. Generate some traffic and wait a few minutes, then check your monitor from the Monitors index. Add a certificate check monitor Go to one.newrelic.com > Synthetics > Create monitor. Select the certificate check monitor type. Specify a name and enter the domain you'd like to monitor. Enter the number of days it takes for your certificate to expire. Select the period to determine your monitor's frequency. Optional: Add tags to help you find this monitor later. Select the locations from which you want your monitor to run, and then click Save monitor to confirm. Generate some traffic and wait a few minutes, then check your monitor from the Monitors index. Add a broken links monitor Go to one.newrelic.com > Synthetics > Create monitor. Select the broken links check monitor type.

They can also: Capture aggregate numbers, including an overview or summary for ping monitors. Provide detailed statistics for each page resource, and downtime incidents. Collect custom response codes for more detail on your monitor runs. You'll be able to add and configure synthetic monitors to suit your environnment after you create a New Relic account. (It's free, forever!) Add a monitor You can add several types of synthetic monitors: Ping monitors ensure your website is responding, while simple browser monitors send real browsers to check your website. For more complex monitoring, scripted browser monitors verify that specific resources are present, while API tests verify your API endpoint. The default timeout for a new monitor is 180 seconds. To learn how to use our step monitor to build complex workflow validation scripts without writing any code, watch this short YouTube video (approx. 3:20 minutes). Add a ping or simple browser monitor Go to one.newrelic.com > Synthetics > Create monitor. Specify a monitor type, name, and URL (may be any valid HTTP or HTTPS URL). Optional: Add a validation string or Advanced options: A validation string is available for ping and simple browser. This option enables substring monitoring for response validation. Verify SSL is available for ping and simple browser. This option verifies the validity of the SSL certificate chain. It can be duplicated by running the following syntax: openssl s_client -servername {YOUR_HOSTNAME} -connect {YOUR_HOSTNAME}:443 -CApath /etc/ssl/certs -verify_hostname {YOUR_HOSTNAME} > /dev/null Copy If a non-zero exit code is returned, the monitor will fail. The Bypass HEAD request option is available for ping. This option skips the default HEAD request and instead uses the GET verb with a ping check. Redirect is Failure is available for ping. If a redirect result occurs when Redirect is Failure is enabled, New Relic Synthetics will categorize the result as a failure, rather than following the redirect and checking the resulting URL. Select the locations from which you want your monitor to run. Choose a frequency to determine how often each location will run your monitor. Optional: Set up alert notifications. Select Create my monitor to confirm. Generate some traffic and wait a few minutes, then check your monitor from the Monitors index. Add a scripted browser or API test monitor Go to one.newrelic.com > Synthetics > Create monitor. Specify a monitor type and name. Select the locations from which you want your monitor to run. Choose a frequency to determine how often each location will run your monitor. Optional: Set up alert notifications. Select Next: Write your script to create a script for your scripted browser or API test, then select Validate to verify your syntax. Tip For complex scripts, validation may take up to one minute. Select Create my monitor to confirm. Generate some traffic and wait a few minutes, then check your monitor from the Monitors index. Add a step monitor Go to one.newrelic.com > Synthetics > Create monitor. Select step monitor as the monitor type. Specify a name and choose a frequency to determine how often each location will run your monitor. Select the locations from which you want your monitor to run. Build your monitor by selecting from the preconfigured steps at the bottom of the UI: Navigate to a URL Type text Click an element Assert text Assert an element Secure a credential Use the instructions on the right side of the UI to help locate elements by CSS class, HTML ID, link text, or XPath.

Optional: Add tags to help you find this monitor later. Select the locations from which you want your monitor to run, and then click Save monitor to confirm. Generate some traffic and wait a few minutes, then check your monitor from the Monitors index. Tip You can also add monitors with the Synthetics REST API. For example, you can create a GET request to the monitor you want to use as the source for configuration, then use those key values to use in a POST to \"copy\" and create a new monitor. Edit a monitor You cannot change a monitor's type after the monitor is created, but you can edit other monitor settings. From the Monitors tab in one.newrelic.com > Synthetics, select the monitor you want to edit. In the side menu, select a link to change the following settings: Select Settings > General to edit name, Apdex T, URL, locations, frequency, and advanced options. For Scripted browser and API test monitors, select Settings > Script to edit your monitor script. For synthetic monitoring alerts, click Manage alerts. Select Save changes to confirm. Delete a monitor You must have Admin privileges in order to delete a monitor. To delete a monitor: From the Monitors tab in one.newrelic.com > Synthetics, select the monitor you want to edit. From the selected monitor, select Settings > General. Scroll to the bottom of the page and select the trash can icon. Tip You can also delete a monitor with the Synthetics REST API. Monitor settings When configuring monitors, the following settings are available: Type Select the type of monitor you want to create. A monitor's type can't be changed after the monitor is created. Ping: Specify a single URL to monitor for availability. New Relic will check this URL via HEAD or GET requests. The non-configurable timeout for this monitor is 60 seconds. Simple browser: Specify a single URL to monitor via real browser. Once each frequency interval, New Relic will check this URL via a Selenium-powered Google Chrome browser. The non-configurable timeout for this monitor is 60 seconds. Scripted browser: Create a script to drive a Selenium-powered Google Chrome browser. The browser follows each step in the script to verify that complex behavior is working as expected (for example, searching a website, then clicking one of the search results). The non-configurable timeout for this monitor is 180 seconds. API test: Create an API script to ensure your API endpoint is working correctly. For more information, see Write API tests. The non-configurable timeout for this monitor is 180 seconds. Monitor name Defines a name for the monitor. Monitor names cannot contain unencoded angle brackets (< >). To include angle brackets in a monitor name, encode them as HTML bracket entities (&lt; &gt;) in the UI or API. Location Select the locations where you want your monitor to run. Select more locations to ensure that your application is available to users around the world. If you have any private locations, they will be listed here too. You can use the Synthetics API location endpoint to retrieve a list of valid locations for your account. Your monitor will run one check from each selected location during each frequency interval. For example, if you select three locations and define a frequency of 15 minutes, your monitor will run three checks in each 15 minute period (or 8,640 checks per month). Frequency Select how often the monitor runs, in increments of minutes, hours, or 1 day. This frequency applies to each location. For example, if you select three locations and a Frequency of 15 minutes, your monitor will run three checks, on average every 5 minutes, in each 15 minute period (or 8,640 checks per month). Alerts Specify an email address to receive alerts when a monitor fails. Or, attach a monitor to an existing alert policy for more notification options. For more information, see Alerting for synthetic monitoring. Apdex T Customize the Apdex T for this monitor. This setting is only available when editing the settings for an existing monitor, not when creating a new monitor. Change the Apdex T from the default 7 seconds for more accurate Apdex scores in your SLA reports. For example, if you have a very long scripted browser, you might adjust the Apdex T to 15 seconds to more closely reflect the usual completion time. Similarly, a good Apdex T for a simple browser check might be only 2 seconds. Response Validation (optional) Specify text to search for on the page. When using simple browser or ping monitor types, there is a 1MB (10^6 bytes) limit on the page load. See a history of monitor changes You can use New Relic One to see a history of recent changes to synthetic monitors and what users changed them.",

      "body": "Synthetic monitoring is a suite of automated, scriptable tools to monitor your websites, critical business transactions, and API endpoints. You can simulate user traffic to proactively detect and resolve outages and poor performance of critical endpoints before your customers notice. Why it matters With synthetic monitoring, you can: Get the context of failures by connecting the availability and performance of endpoints to the underlying applications and infrastructure. Easily diagnose if an issue stems from the network or AWS location, a slow third party resource, or the health of backend services or infrastructure. Add synthetic monitoring into build automation and CI/CD pipelines to automatically track performance and check functionality for each deployment. Expand your monitoring further with real, Selenium-powered scripted browsers, which test login procedures, searches, and other critical business transactions. Monitor your API endpoints with API tests. Ready to get started? If you don't already have one, sign up for a New Relic account. It's free, forever! Synthetic monitoring has countless use cases, and knowing the right monitor type for yours is important. To learn about our different types of synthetic monitors and the differences between each, watch this short video (5:10 minutes). Advanced testing Synthetic monitoring allows you to proactively monitor your website or API endpoint to ensure your content is not only available, but fully functional. Synthetic monitoring browser tests send real, Selenium-powered Google Chrome browsers to your site from locations around the world to ensure your content is always up, everywhere. Scripted browsers expand your testing capabilities, so you can test uncommon user flows or beta-test complex procedures. For example, ensure your users are able to sign up for your newsletter, add an item to their cart, or search for and find a piece of critical content with a simple JavaScript-like language. Test your backend with API monitors, which allow you to run scripted tests against any API endpoint. Enhanced monitoring and reporting Synthetic monitoring aggregates the results of each check into metrics, allowing you to see patterns and identify causes of poor performance. Synthetic monitoring also stores each and every monitor result, so you can see exactly where your website broke down. Alerts notify you if your website or API endpoint is inaccessible. You can even expand your geographical coverage or monitor internal websites by creating private locations. You can also query your monitor results for a closer look. New Relic retains monitor results for thirteen months, ensuring you can compare usage year over year. Additional features Synthetic monitoring includes the following features: Feature Description Real browsers With simple browser and scripted browser monitors, synthetic monitoring doesn't simply check that your host is up. It loads the actual page content in a real, fully virtualized Google Chrome browser (powered by Selenium) to provide testing that mirrors your users' actions. Detailed results view Synthetic monitoring stores every single run of your monitor for 13 months, so you can view a detailed breakdown of each and every check. You can get a snapshot of your website's performance and availability, or hunt down specific problems. Comparative charts with browser monitoring Use New Relic's comparative charting feature for a direct page load time comparison between real user (browser monitoring) interactions and the synthetic monitors. For example, during a page outage, you can compare trends to see if an issue is also visible in synthetic monitoring, or if it is caused by other variables. Advanced scripted monitoring Use scripted browsers to run complex test cases against your website. Ensure critical processes like checkout and login are always running smoothly, and build a baseline to compare against when things go wrong. With a built-in scripting IDE based on Node.js, create scripts quickly without leaving your browser. Global test coverage Check coverage from locations around the world to ensure your users can access your website from anywhere, anytime. Monitor sites behind your firewall by adding the synthetic monitoring static IP addresses to your allow list. Use private locations to monitor internal sites or to expand your coverage to new locations. Compatibility with popular analytics platforms Synthetic monitoring specifically excludes scripts for popular analytics services, like Google Analytics. This ensures your analytics tools continue to receive the exact same data, even with thousands of monitors checking your website each month. You can unblock any of the services blocked by default, or block additional services. REST API functions Synthetic monitoring includes a REST API, which you can use to manage: Simple monitors and scripted monitors Categories and labels for monitors Alert notifications Data protection and privacy The data from synthetic monitoring is test data, representing typical interaction with the webpage or application. It is never actual data from human beings. The data collected when you use synthetic monitoring therefore is not personal data. For more information, see the Synthetic monitoring security documentation. Compatibility and requirements Synthetic monitoring does not require any software except a supported browser. Important To monitor a site behind your firewall, add the synthetic monitoring public minion IP addresses to your allow list. Permissions By default, all users in your account can: View synthetic monitoring pages. Add, edit, and delete monitors. For more fine-grained control, you can enable the optional permissions system. The permissions system allows you to manage the level of access for users to view and edit within synthetic monitoring (for example, monitors and private locations).",

This allows you to take advantage of enhanced monitoring options and be notified when New Relic has stopped receiving data from your hosts. Types of monitors These are the seven types of synthetic monitors: Type of synthetic monitor Description Broken links monitor API name: SCRIPT_API Provide a url and this monitor will test all the links on the page for success. If a failure is detected you can view the individual non-successful links that caused the failure. Certificate check monitor API name: SCRIPT_API Proactively ping your domain certificates based on a configurable threshold. Pair with an alert to ensure you are notified when your certificates need renewed. Ping monitor API name: SIMPLE Ping monitors are the simplest type of monitor. They simply check to see if an application is online. The synthetic ping monitor uses a simple Java HTTP client to make requests to your site. For consistency with other synthetic monitor types, the user agent is identified as Google Chrome. However, the HTTP client is not a full browser, and it does not execute JavaScript. If you need JavaScript functionality, use a simple browser monitor. Step monitor API name: STEP_MONITOR Step monitors are advanced monitors which require no code to set up. The monitor can be configured to: Assert modal Assert text Assert title Assert an element Click an element Dismiss a modal Double click an element Enter a secure credential Hover over an element Locate an element by CSS class, HTML ID, link text, Xpath, or value Navigate to a URL Select from a dropdown Type text Simple browser monitors API name: BROWSER Simple browser monitors essentially are simple, pre-built scripted browser monitors. They make a request to your site using an instance of Google Chrome. Compared to a simple ping monitor, this is a more accurate emulation of an actual customer visit. The user agent is identified as Google Chrome. Scripted browser monitors API name: SCRIPT_BROWSER Scripted browser monitors are used for more sophisticated, customized monitoring. You can create a custom script that navigates your website, takes specific actions, and ensures specific resources are present. The monitor uses Google Chrome browser. You can also use a variety of third-party modules to build your custom monitor. API tests API name: SCRIPT_API API tests are used to monitor your API endpoints. This can ensure that your app server works in addition to your website. New Relic uses the http-request module internally to make HTTP calls to your endpoint and validate the results. You can add and edit synthetic monitors directly in our UI. You can also create some synthetic monitors with Terraform. To learn how, watch this short YouTube video (approx. 3:25 minutes).",

      "body": "Synthetic monitors are API checks or virtual browser instances that monitor your website, recording each check in detail. They can also: Capture aggregate numbers, including an overview or summary for ping monitors. Provide detailed statistics for each page resource, and downtime incidents. Collect custom response codes for more detail on your monitor runs. You'll be able to add and configure synthetic monitors to suit your environnment after you create a New Relic account. (It's free, forever!) Add a monitor You can add several types of synthetic monitors: Ping monitors ensure your website is responding, while simple browser monitors send real browsers to check your website. For more complex monitoring, scripted browser monitors verify that specific resources are present, while API tests verify your API endpoint. The default timeout for a new monitor is 180 seconds. To learn how to use our step monitor to build complex workflow validation scripts without writing any code, watch this short YouTube video (approx. 3:20 minutes). Add a ping or simple browser monitor Go to one.newrelic.com > Synthetics > Create monitor. Specify a monitor type, name, and URL (may be any valid HTTP or HTTPS URL). Optional: Add a validation string or Advanced options: A validation string is available for ping and simple browser. This option enables substring monitoring for response validation. Verify SSL is available for ping and simple browser. This option verifies the validity of the SSL certificate chain. It can be duplicated by running the following syntax: openssl s_client -servername {YOUR_HOSTNAME} -connect {YOUR_HOSTNAME}:443 -CApath /etc/ssl/certs -verify_hostname {YOUR_HOSTNAME} > /dev/null Copy If a non-zero exit code is returned, the monitor will fail. The Bypass HEAD request option is available for ping. This option skips the default HEAD request and instead uses the GET verb with a ping check. Redirect is Failure is available for ping. If a redirect result occurs when Redirect is Failure is enabled, New Relic Synthetics will categorize the result as a failure, rather than following the redirect and checking the resulting URL. Select the locations from which you want your monitor to run. Choose a frequency to determine how often each location will run your monitor. Optional: Set up alert notifications. Select Create my monitor to confirm. Generate some traffic and wait a few minutes, then check your monitor from the Monitors index. Add a scripted browser or API test monitor Go to one.newrelic.com > Synthetics > Create monitor. Specify a monitor type and name. Select the locations from which you want your monitor to run. Choose a frequency to determine how often each location will run your monitor. Optional: Set up alert notifications. Select Next: Write your script to create a script for your scripted browser or API test, then select Validate to verify your syntax. Tip For complex scripts, validation may take up to one minute. Select Create my monitor to confirm. Generate some traffic and wait a few minutes, then check your monitor from the Monitors index. Add a step monitor Go to one.newrelic.com > Synthetics > Create monitor. Select step monitor as the monitor type. Specify a name and choose a frequency to determine how often each location will run your monitor. Select the locations from which you want your monitor to run. Build your monitor by selecting from the preconfigured steps at the bottom of the UI: Navigate to a URL Type text Click an element Assert text Assert an element Secure a credential Use the instructions on the right side of the UI to help locate elements by CSS class, HTML ID, link text, or XPath. Select Save monitor to confirm. Generate some traffic and wait a few minutes, then check your monitor from the Monitors index. Add a certificate check monitor Go to one.newrelic.com > Synthetics > Create monitor. Select the certificate check monitor type. Specify a name and enter the domain you'd like to monitor. Enter the number of days it takes for your certificate to expire. Select the period to determine your monitor's frequency. Optional: Add tags to help you find this monitor later. Select the locations from which you want your monitor to run, and then click Save monitor to confirm. Generate some traffic and wait a few minutes, then check your monitor from the Monitors index. Add a broken links monitor Go to one.newrelic.com > Synthetics > Create monitor. Select the broken links check monitor type. Specify a name and enter the URL you'd like to monitor (may be any valid HTTP or HTTPS URL). Select the period to determine your monitor's frequency. Optional: Add tags to help you find this monitor later. Select the locations from which you want your monitor to run, and then click Save monitor to confirm. Generate some traffic and wait a few minutes, then check your monitor from the Monitors index. Tip You can also add monitors with the Synthetics REST API. For example, you can create a GET request to the monitor you want to use as the source for configuration, then use those key values to use in a POST to \"copy\" and create a new monitor. Edit a monitor You cannot change a monitor's type after the monitor is created, but you can edit other monitor settings. From the Monitors tab in one.newrelic.com > Synthetics, select the monitor you want to edit. In the side menu, select a link to change the following settings: Select Settings > General to edit name, Apdex T, URL, locations, frequency, and advanced options. For Scripted browser and API test monitors, select Settings > Script to edit your monitor script. For synthetic monitoring alerts, click Manage alerts. Select Save changes to confirm. Delete a monitor You must have Admin privileges in order to delete a monitor. To delete a monitor: From the Monitors tab in one.newrelic.com > Synthetics, select the monitor you want to edit. From the selected monitor, select Settings > General. Scroll to the bottom of the page and select the trash can icon. Tip You can also delete a monitor with the Synthetics REST API. Monitor settings When configuring monitors, the following settings are available: Type Select the type of monitor you want to create. A monitor's type can't be changed after the monitor is created. Ping: Specify a single URL to monitor for availability. New Relic will check this URL via HEAD or GET requests. The non-configurable timeout for this monitor is 60 seconds. Simple browser: Specify a single URL to monitor via real browser. Once each frequency interval, New Relic will check this URL via a Selenium-powered Google Chrome browser. The non-configurable timeout for this monitor is 60 seconds. Scripted browser: Create a script to drive a Selenium-powered Google Chrome browser. The browser follows each step in the script to verify that complex behavior is working as expected (for example, searching a website, then clicking one of the search results). The non-configurable timeout for this monitor is 180 seconds. API test: Create an API script to ensure your API endpoint is working correctly. For more information, see Write API tests. The non-configurable timeout for this monitor is 180 seconds. Monitor name Defines a name for the monitor. Monitor names cannot contain unencoded angle brackets (< >). To include angle brackets in a monitor name, encode them as HTML bracket entities (&lt; &gt;) in the UI or API. Location Select the locations where you want your monitor to run. Select more locations to ensure that your application is available to users around the world. If you have any private locations, they will be listed here too. You can use the Synthetics API location endpoint to retrieve a list of valid locations for your account. Your monitor will run one check from each selected location during each frequency interval. For example, if you select three locations and define a frequency of 15 minutes, your monitor will run three checks in each 15 minute period (or 8,640 checks per month). Frequency Select how often the monitor runs, in increments of minutes, hours, or 1 day. This frequency applies to each location. For example, if you select three locations and a Frequency of 15 minutes, your monitor will run three checks, on average every 5 minutes, in each 15 minute period (or 8,640 checks per month). Alerts Specify an email address to receive alerts when a monitor fails. Or, attach a monitor to an existing alert policy for more notification options. For more information, see Alerting for synthetic monitoring. Apdex T Customize the Apdex T for this monitor. This setting is only available when editing the settings for an existing monitor, not when creating a new monitor. Change the Apdex T from the default 7 seconds for more accurate Apdex scores in your SLA reports. For example, if you have a very long scripted browser, you might adjust the Apdex T to 15 seconds to more closely reflect the usual completion time. Similarly, a good Apdex T for a simple browser check might be only 2 seconds. Response Validation (optional) Specify text to search for on the page. When using simple browser or ping monitor types, there is a 1MB (10^6 bytes) limit on the page load.

They can also: Capture aggregate numbers, including an overview or summary for ping monitors. Provide detailed statistics for each page resource, and downtime incidents. Collect custom response codes for more detail on your monitor runs. You'll be able to add and configure synthetic monitors to suit your environnment after you create a New Relic account. (It's free, forever!) Add a monitor You can add several types of synthetic monitors: Ping monitors ensure your website is responding, while simple browser monitors send real browsers to check your website. For more complex monitoring, scripted browser monitors verify that specific resources are present, while API tests verify your API endpoint. The default timeout for a new monitor is 180 seconds. To learn how to use our step monitor to build complex workflow validation scripts without writing any code, watch this short YouTube video (approx. 3:20 minutes). Add a ping or simple browser monitor Go to one.newrelic.com > Synthetics > Create monitor. Specify a monitor type, name, and URL (may be any valid HTTP or HTTPS URL). Optional: Add a validation string or Advanced options: A validation string is available for ping and simple browser. This option enables substring monitoring for response validation. Verify SSL is available for ping and simple browser. This option verifies the validity of the SSL certificate chain. It can be duplicated by running the following syntax: openssl s_client -servername {YOUR_HOSTNAME} -connect {YOUR_HOSTNAME}:443 -CApath /etc/ssl/certs -verify_hostname {YOUR_HOSTNAME} > /dev/null Copy If a non-zero exit code is returned, the monitor will fail. The Bypass HEAD request option is available for ping. This option skips the default HEAD request and instead uses the GET verb with a ping check. Redirect is Failure is available for ping. If a redirect result occurs when Redirect is Failure is enabled, New Relic Synthetics will categorize the result as a failure, rather than following the redirect and checking the resulting URL. Select the locations from which you want your monitor to run. Choose a frequency to determine how often each location will run your monitor. Optional: Set up alert notifications. Select Create my monitor to confirm. Generate some traffic and wait a few minutes, then check your monitor from the Monitors index. Add a scripted browser or API test monitor Go to one.newrelic.com > Synthetics > Create monitor. Specify a monitor type and name. Select the locations from which you want your monitor to run. Choose a frequency to determine how often each location will run your monitor. Optional: Set up alert notifications. Select Next: Write your script to create a script for your scripted browser or API test, then select Validate to verify your syntax. Tip For complex scripts, validation may take up to one minute. Select Create my monitor to confirm. Generate some traffic and wait a few minutes, then check your monitor from the Monitors index. Add a step monitor Go to one.newrelic.com > Synthetics > Create monitor. Select step monitor as the monitor type. Specify a name and choose a frequency to determine how often each location will run your monitor. Select the locations from which you want your monitor to run. Build your monitor by selecting from the preconfigured steps at the bottom of the UI: Navigate to a URL Type text Click an element Assert text Assert an element Secure a credential Use the instructions on the right side of the UI to help locate elements by CSS class, HTML ID, link text, or XPath. Select Save monitor to confirm. Generate some traffic and wait a few minutes, then check your monitor from the Monitors index. Add a certificate check monitor Go to one.newrelic.com > Synthetics > Create monitor. Select the certificate check monitor type. Specify a name and enter the domain you'd like to monitor. Enter the number of days it takes for your certificate to expire. Select the period to determine your monitor's frequency. Optional: Add tags to help you find this monitor later. Select the locations from which you want your monitor to run, and then click Save monitor to confirm. Generate some traffic and wait a few minutes, then check your monitor from the Monitors index. Add a broken links monitor Go to one.newrelic.com > Synthetics > Create monitor. Select the broken links check monitor type. Specify a name and enter the URL you'd like to monitor (may be any valid HTTP or HTTPS URL). Select the period to determine your monitor's frequency. Optional: Add tags to help you find this monitor later. Select the locations from which you want your monitor to run, and then click Save monitor to confirm. Generate some traffic and wait a few minutes, then check your monitor from the Monitors index. Tip You can also add monitors with the Synthetics REST API. For example, you can create a GET request to the monitor you want to use as the source for configuration, then use those key values to use in a POST to \"copy\" and create a new monitor. Edit a monitor You cannot change a monitor's type after the monitor is created, but you can edit other monitor settings. From the Monitors tab in one.newrelic.com > Synthetics, select the monitor you want to edit. In the side menu, select a link to change the following settings: Select Settings > General to edit name, Apdex T, URL, locations, frequency, and advanced options. For Scripted browser and API test monitors, select Settings > Script to edit your monitor script. For synthetic monitoring alerts, click Manage alerts. Select Save changes to confirm. Delete a monitor You must have Admin privileges in order to delete a monitor. To delete a monitor: From the Monitors tab in one.newrelic.com > Synthetics, select the monitor you want to edit. From the selected monitor, select Settings > General. Scroll to the bottom of the page and select the trash can icon. Tip You can also delete a monitor with the Synthetics REST API. Monitor settings When configuring monitors, the following settings are available: Type Select the type of monitor you want to create. A monitor's type can't be changed after the monitor is created. Ping: Specify a single URL to monitor for availability. New Relic will check this URL via HEAD or GET requests. The non-configurable timeout for this monitor is 60 seconds. Simple browser: Specify a single URL to monitor via real browser. Once each frequency interval, New Relic will check this URL via a Selenium-powered Google Chrome browser. The non-configurable timeout for this monitor is 60 seconds. Scripted browser: Create a script to drive a Selenium-powered Google Chrome browser. The browser follows each step in the script to verify that complex behavior is working as expected (for example, searching a website, then clicking one of the search results). The non-configurable timeout for this monitor is 180 seconds. API test: Create an API script to ensure your API endpoint is working correctly. For more information, see Write API tests. The non-configurable timeout for this monitor is 180 seconds. Monitor name Defines a name for the monitor. Monitor names cannot contain unencoded angle brackets (< >). To include angle brackets in a monitor name, encode them as HTML bracket entities (&lt; &gt;) in the UI or API. Location Select the locations where you want your monitor to run. Select more locations to ensure that your application is available to users around the world. If you have any private locations, they will be listed here too. You can use the Synthetics API location endpoint to retrieve a list of valid locations for your account. Your monitor will run one check from each selected location during each frequency interval. For example, if you select three locations and define a frequency of 15 minutes, your monitor will run three checks in each 15 minute period (or 8,640 checks per month). Frequency Select how often the monitor runs, in increments of minutes, hours, or 1 day. This frequency applies to each location. For example, if you select three locations and a Frequency of 15 minutes, your monitor will run three checks, on average every 5 minutes, in each 15 minute period (or 8,640 checks per month). Alerts Specify an email address to receive alerts when a monitor fails. Or, attach a monitor to an existing alert policy for more notification options. For more information, see Alerting for synthetic monitoring. Apdex T Customize the Apdex T for this monitor. This setting is only available when editing the settings for an existing monitor, not when creating a new monitor. Change the Apdex T from the default 7 seconds for more accurate Apdex scores in your SLA reports. For example, if you have a very long scripted browser, you might adjust the Apdex T to 15 seconds to more closely reflect the usual completion time. Similarly, a good Apdex T for a simple browser check might be only 2 seconds. Response Validation (optional) Specify text to search for on the page. When using simple browser or ping monitor types, there is a 1MB (10^6 bytes) limit on the page load.

Use the Synthetics REST API to manage monitors. Set up monitors from specific locations or for private servers. You can also use the host not reporting feature in infrastructure monitoring. This allows you to take advantage of enhanced monitoring options and be notified when New Relic has stopped receiving data from your hosts. Types of monitors These are the seven types of synthetic monitors: Type of synthetic monitor Description Broken links monitor API name: SCRIPT_API Provide a url and this monitor will test all the links on the page for success. If a failure is detected you can view the individual non-successful links that caused the failure. Certificate check monitor API name: SCRIPT_API Proactively ping your domain certificates based on a configurable threshold. Pair with an alert to ensure you are notified when your certificates need renewed. Ping monitor API name: SIMPLE Ping monitors are the simplest type of monitor. They simply check to see if an application is online. The synthetic ping monitor uses a simple Java HTTP client to make requests to your site. For consistency with other synthetic monitor types, the user agent is identified as Google Chrome. However, the HTTP client is not a full browser, and it does not execute JavaScript. If you need JavaScript functionality, use a simple browser monitor. Step monitor API name: STEP_MONITOR Step monitors are advanced monitors which require no code to set up. The monitor can be configured to: Assert modal Assert text Assert title Assert an element Click an element Dismiss a modal Double click an element Enter a secure credential Hover over an element Locate an element by CSS class, HTML ID, link text, Xpath, or value Navigate to a URL Select from a dropdown Type text Simple browser monitors API name: BROWSER Simple browser monitors essentially are simple, pre-built scripted browser monitors. They make a request to your site using an instance of Google Chrome. Compared to a simple ping monitor, this is a more accurate emulation of an actual customer visit. The user agent is identified as Google Chrome. Scripted browser monitors API name: SCRIPT_BROWSER Scripted browser monitors are used for more sophisticated, customized monitoring. You can create a custom script that navigates your website, takes specific actions, and ensures specific resources are present. The monitor uses Google Chrome browser. You can also use a variety of third-party modules to build your custom monitor. API tests API name: SCRIPT_API API tests are used to monitor your API endpoints. This can ensure that your app server works in addition to your website. New Relic uses the http-request module internally to make HTTP calls to your endpoint and validate the results. You can add and edit synthetic monitors directly in our UI. You can also create some synthetic monitors with Terraform. To learn how, watch this short YouTube video (approx. 3:25 minutes).",

This allows you to take advantage of enhanced monitoring options and be notified when New Relic has stopped receiving data from your hosts. Types of monitors These are the seven types of synthetic monitors: Type of synthetic monitor Description Broken links monitor API name: SCRIPT_API Provide a url and this monitor will test all the links on the page for success. If a failure is detected you can view the individual non-successful links that caused the failure. Certificate check monitor API name: SCRIPT_API Proactively ping your domain certificates based on a configurable threshold. Pair with an alert to ensure you are notified when your certificates need renewed. Ping monitor API name: SIMPLE Ping monitors are the simplest type of monitor. They simply check to see if an application is online. The synthetic ping monitor uses a simple Java HTTP client to make requests to your site. For consistency with other synthetic monitor types, the user agent is identified as Google Chrome. However, the HTTP client is not a full browser, and it does not execute JavaScript. If you need JavaScript functionality, use a simple browser monitor. Step monitor API name: STEP_MONITOR Step monitors are advanced monitors which require no code to set up. The monitor can be configured to: Assert modal Assert text Assert title Assert an element Click an element Dismiss a modal Double click an element Enter a secure credential Hover over an element Locate an element by CSS class, HTML ID, link text, Xpath, or value Navigate to a URL Select from a dropdown Type text Simple browser monitors API name: BROWSER Simple browser monitors essentially are simple, pre-built scripted browser monitors. They make a request to your site using an instance of Google Chrome. Compared to a simple ping monitor, this is a more accurate emulation of an actual customer visit. The user agent is identified as Google Chrome. Scripted browser monitors API name: SCRIPT_BROWSER Scripted browser monitors are used for more sophisticated, customized monitoring. You can create a custom script that navigates your website, takes specific actions, and ensures specific resources are present. The monitor uses Google Chrome browser. You can also use a variety of third-party modules to build your custom monitor. API tests API name: SCRIPT_API API tests are used to monitor your API endpoints. This can ensure that your app server works in addition to your website. New Relic uses the http-request module internally to make HTTP calls to your endpoint and validate the results. You can add and edit synthetic monitors directly in our UI. You can also create some synthetic monitors with Terraform. To learn how, watch this short YouTube video (approx. 3:25 minutes).",

      "body": "Synthetic monitors are API checks or virtual browser instances that monitor your website, recording each check in detail. They can also: Capture aggregate numbers, including an overview or summary for ping monitors. Provide detailed statistics for each page resource, and downtime incidents. Collect custom response codes for more detail on your monitor runs. You'll be able to add and configure synthetic monitors to suit your environnment after you create a New Relic account. (It's free, forever!) Add a monitor You can add several types of synthetic monitors: Ping monitors ensure your website is responding, while simple browser monitors send real browsers to check your website. For more complex monitoring, scripted browser monitors verify that specific resources are present, while API tests verify your API endpoint. The default timeout for a new monitor is 180 seconds. To learn how to use our step monitor to build complex workflow validation scripts without writing any code, watch this short YouTube video (approx. 3:20 minutes). Add a ping or simple browser monitor Go to one.newrelic.com > Synthetics > Create monitor. Specify a monitor type, name, and URL (may be any valid HTTP or HTTPS URL). Optional: Add a validation string or Advanced options: A validation string is available for ping and simple browser. This option enables substring monitoring for response validation. Verify SSL is available for ping and simple browser. This option verifies the validity of the SSL certificate chain. It can be duplicated by running the following syntax: openssl s_client -servername {YOUR_HOSTNAME} -connect {YOUR_HOSTNAME}:443 -CApath /etc/ssl/certs -verify_hostname {YOUR_HOSTNAME} > /dev/null Copy If a non-zero exit code is returned, the monitor will fail. The Bypass HEAD request option is available for ping. This option skips the default HEAD request and instead uses the GET verb with a ping check. Redirect is Failure is available for ping. If a redirect result occurs when Redirect is Failure is enabled, New Relic Synthetics will categorize the result as a failure, rather than following the redirect and checking the resulting URL. Select the locations from which you want your monitor to run. Choose a frequency to determine how often each location will run your monitor. Optional: Set up alert notifications. Select Create my monitor to confirm. Generate some traffic and wait a few minutes, then check your monitor from the Monitors index. Add a scripted browser or API test monitor Go to one.newrelic.com > Synthetics > Create monitor. Specify a monitor type and name. Select the locations from which you want your monitor to run. Choose a frequency to determine how often each location will run your monitor. Optional: Set up alert notifications. Select Next: Write your script to create a script for your scripted browser or API test, then select Validate to verify your syntax. Tip For complex scripts, validation may take up to one minute. Select Create my monitor to confirm. Generate some traffic and wait a few minutes, then check your monitor from the Monitors index. Add a step monitor Go to one.newrelic.com > Synthetics > Create monitor. Select step monitor as the monitor type. Specify a name and choose a frequency to determine how often each location will run your monitor. Select the locations from which you want your monitor to run. Build your monitor by selecting from the preconfigured steps at the bottom of the UI: Navigate to a URL Type text Click an element Assert text Assert an element Secure a credential Use the instructions on the right side of the UI to help locate elements by CSS class, HTML ID, link text, or XPath. Select Save monitor to confirm. Generate some traffic and wait a few minutes, then check your monitor from the Monitors index. Add a certificate check monitor Go to one.newrelic.com > Synthetics > Create monitor. Select the certificate check monitor type. Specify a name and enter the domain you'd like to monitor. Enter the number of days it takes for your certificate to expire. Select the period to determine your monitor's frequency. Optional: Add tags to help you find this monitor later. Select the locations from which you want your monitor to run, and then click Save monitor to confirm. Generate some traffic and wait a few minutes, then check your monitor from the Monitors index. Add a broken links monitor Go to one.newrelic.com > Synthetics > Create monitor. Select the broken links check monitor type. Specify a name and enter the URL you'd like to monitor (may be any valid HTTP or HTTPS URL). Select the period to determine your monitor's frequency. Optional: Add tags to help you find this monitor later. Select the locations from which you want your monitor to run, and then click Save monitor to confirm. Generate some traffic and wait a few minutes, then check your monitor from the Monitors index. Tip You can also add monitors with the Synthetics REST API. For example, you can create a GET request to the monitor you want to use as the source for configuration, then use those key values to use in a POST to \"copy\" and create a new monitor. Edit a monitor You cannot change a monitor's type after the monitor is created, but you can edit other monitor settings. From the Monitors tab in one.newrelic.com > Synthetics, select the monitor you want to edit. In the side menu, select a link to change the following settings: Select Settings > General to edit name, Apdex T, URL, locations, frequency, and advanced options. For Scripted browser and API test monitors, select Settings > Script to edit your monitor script. For synthetic monitoring alerts, click Manage alerts. Select Save changes to confirm. Delete a monitor You must have Admin privileges in order to delete a monitor. To delete a monitor: From the Monitors tab in one.newrelic.com > Synthetics, select the monitor you want to edit. From the selected monitor, select Settings > General. Scroll to the bottom of the page and select the trash can icon. Tip You can also delete a monitor with the Synthetics REST API. Monitor settings When configuring monitors, the following settings are available: Type Select the type of monitor you want to create. A monitor's type can't be changed after the monitor is created. Ping: Specify a single URL to monitor for availability. New Relic will check this URL via HEAD or GET requests. The non-configurable timeout for this monitor is 60 seconds. Simple browser: Specify a single URL to monitor via real browser. Once each frequency interval, New Relic will check this URL via a Selenium-powered Google Chrome browser. The non-configurable timeout for this monitor is 60 seconds. Scripted browser: Create a script to drive a Selenium-powered Google Chrome browser. The browser follows each step in the script to verify that complex behavior is working as expected (for example, searching a website, then clicking one of the search results). The non-configurable timeout for this monitor is 180 seconds. API test: Create an API script to ensure your API endpoint is working correctly. For more information, see Write API tests. The non-configurable timeout for this monitor is 180 seconds. Monitor name Defines a name for the monitor. Monitor names cannot contain unencoded angle brackets (< >). To include angle brackets in a monitor name, encode them as HTML bracket entities (&lt; &gt;) in the UI or API. Location Select the locations where you want your monitor to run. Select more locations to ensure that your application is available to users around the world. If you have any private locations, they will be listed here too. You can use the Synthetics API location endpoint to retrieve a list of valid locations for your account. Your monitor will run one check from each selected location during each frequency interval. For example, if you select three locations and define a frequency of 15 minutes, your monitor will run three checks in each 15 minute period (or 8,640 checks per month). Frequency Select how often the monitor runs, in increments of minutes, hours, or 1 day. This frequency applies to each location. For example, if you select three locations and a Frequency of 15 minutes, your monitor will run three checks, on average every 5 minutes, in each 15 minute period (or 8,640 checks per month). Alerts Specify an email address to receive alerts when a monitor fails. Or, attach a monitor to an existing alert policy for more notification options. For more information, see Alerting for synthetic monitoring. Apdex T Customize the Apdex T for this monitor. This setting is only available when editing the settings for an existing monitor, not when creating a new monitor. Change the Apdex T from the default 7 seconds for more accurate Apdex scores in your SLA reports. For example, if you have a very long scripted browser, you might adjust the Apdex T to 15 seconds to more closely reflect the usual completion time. Similarly, a good Apdex T for a simple browser check might be only 2 seconds. Response Validation (optional) Specify text to search for on the page. When using simple browser or ping monitor types, there is a 1MB (10^6 bytes) limit on the page load.

      "body": "You can use New Relic's containerized private minions (CPM). These are Docker container-based private minions that accept and execute synthetic monitors against your private locations. The CPM can operate in a Docker container system environment or a Kubernetes container orchestration system environment. The CPM will auto-detect its environment to select the appropriate operating mode. General private minion features Because the CPM operates as a container instead of a virtual machine, it delivers many features: Easy to install, start, and update Runs on: Linux macOS Windows Enhanced security and support for non-root user execution Ability to leverage a Docker container as a sandbox environment Customizable monitor check timeout Custom provided modules for scripted monitor types Kubernetes-specific features Also, the CPM delivers the following features in a Kubernetes environment: Integrates with the Kubernetes API to delegate runtime lifecycle management to Kubernetes Does not require privileged access to the Docker socket Supports hosted and on-premise Kubernetes clusters Supports various container engines such as Docker and Containerd Deployable via Helm charts as well as configuration YAMLs Allows job (ping vs. non-ping checks) based resource allocation for optimum resource management Observability offered via the New Relic One Kubernetes cluster explorer System requirements and compatibility To host CPMs, your system must meet the minimum requirements for the chosen system environment. Caution Do not modify any CPM files. New Relic is not liable for any modifications you make. For more information, contact your account representative or a New Relic technical sales rep. Docker container system environment requirements Compatibility for Requirements Operating system Linux kernel: 3.10 or higher. macOS: 10.11 or higher. Windows: Windows 10 64-bit or higher. You must also configure Docker to run Linux containers in order for CPMs to work on Windows systems. Processor A modern, multi-core CPU Memory 2.5 GiB of RAM per CPU core (dedicated) Disk space A minimum of 10 GB per host Docker version Docker 17.12.1-ce or higher Private location key You must have a private location key Caution The Docker CPM is not designed for use with container orchestrators like AWS ECS, Docker Swarm, Apache Mesos, Azure Container Instances, etc. Running the Docker CPM in a container orchestrator will result in unexpected issues because it is itself a container orchestrator. If you're using container orchestration, see our Kubernetes CPM requirements. Kubernetes container orchestration system environment requirements (CPM v3.0.0 or higher) Compatibility for Requirements Operating system Linux kernel: 3.10 or higher macOS: 10.11 or higher Windows: Windows 10 64-bit or higher Processor A modern, multi-core CPU Minion pod CPU (vCPU/Core): 0.5 up to 0.75 Memory: 800 Mi up to 1.6 Gi Resources allocated to a Minion pod are user configurable. Runner pod CPU (vCPU/Core): 0.5 up to 1 Memory: 1.25 Gi up to 3 Gi For a scripted API check, 1.25 Gi will be requested with a limit of 2.5 Gi. For a simple browser or scripted browser check, 2 Gi will be requested with a limit of 3 Gi. Additional considerations: Resources allocated to a runner pod are not user configurable. The maximum limit-request resource ratio for both CPU and memory is 2. Disk space Persistent volume (PV) of at least 10 Gi in size Note that if a ReadWriteOnce (RWO) PV is provided to the minion, an implicit node affinity will be established to ensure the minion and the runner containers are scheduled on the same node. This is required to allow the minion and the associated runners access to the PV, as an RWO PV can be accessed only by a single node in the cluster. Kubernetes version We recommend that your Kubernetes cluster supports Kubernetes v1.15. Caution We have identified a compatibility issue with Kubernetes v1.21+. A workaround is available by disabling the BoundServiceAccountTokenVolume feature gate on the cluster. Private location key You must have a private location key Helm Follow installation instructions for Helm v3 for your OS. Kubectl Follow installation instructions for Kubectl for your OS. To view versions, dependencies, default values for how many runner pods start with each minion, the Persistent volume access mode, and more, please see Show help and examples below. Private location key Before launching CPMs, you must have a private location key. Your CPM uses the key to authenticate against New Relic and run monitors associated with that private location. To find the key for existing private location: Go to one.newrelic.com > Synthetics > Private locations. In the Private locations index, locate the private location you want your CPM to be assigned to. Note the key associated with the private location with the key icon. Sandboxing and Docker dependencies Sandboxing and Docker dependencies are applicable to the CPM in a Docker container system environment. Docker dependencies The CPM runs in Docker and is able to leverage Docker as a sandboxing technology. This ensures complete isolation of the monitor execution, which improves security, reliability, and repeatability. Every time a scripted or browser monitor is executed, the CPM creates a brand new Docker container to run it in called a runner. The minion container needs to be configured to communicate with the Docker engine in order to spawn additional runner containers. Each spawned container is then dedicated to run a check associated with the synthetic monitor running on the private location the minion container is associated with. There are two crucial dependencies at launch. To enable sandboxing, ensure that: Your writable and executable directory is mounted at /tmp. The writable directory can be any directory you want the CPM to write into, but New Relic recommends the system's own /tmp to make things easy. Your writable Docker UNIX socket is mounted at /var/run/docker.sock or DOCKER_HOST environment variable. For more information, see Docker's Daemon socket option. Caution Core count on the host determines how many runner containers the CPM can run concurrently on the host. Since memory requirements are scaled to the expected count of runner containers, we recommend not running multiple CPMs on the same host to avoid resource contention. For additional information on sandboxing and running as a root or non-root user, see Security, sandboxing, and running as non-root. Install and update CPM versions Both installing and updating the CPM use the same command to pull the latest Docker image from the Quay.io repository where the CPM Docker image is hosted. Go to quay.io/repository/newrelic/synthetics-minion for a list of all the releases. CPM images are also hosted on Docker Hub. Go to hub.docker.com/r/newrelic/synthetics-minion/tags for a list of all the releases. Unless hosting the images in a local image repository, connections to either quay.io or docker.io will need to be allowed through your firewall in order for Docker to pull the synthetics-minion and synthetics-minion-runner images. The \"runner\" image is pulled automatically on startup of the synthetics-minion container. See Docker environment configuration and Kubernetes environment configuration for details on how to set a local repository and the runner registry endpoint. Start the CPM To start the CPM, follow the applicable Docker or Kubernetes instructions. Docker start procedure Locate your private location key. Ensure you've enabled Docker dependencies for sandboxing and installed CPM on your system. Run the appropriate script for your system. Tailor the common defaults for /tmp and /var/run/docker.sock in the following examples to match your system. Linux/macOS: docker run \\ --name YOUR_CONTAINER_NAME \\ -e \"MINION_PRIVATE_LOCATION_KEY=YOUR_PRIVATE_LOCATION_KEY\" \\ -v /tmp:/tmp:rw \\ -v /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock:rw \\ -d \\ --restart unless-stopped \\ quay.io/newrelic/synthetics-minion:latest Copy Windows: docker run ^ --name YOUR_CONTAINER_NAME ^ -e \"MINION_PRIVATE_LOCATION_KEY=YOUR_PRIVATE_LOCATION_KEY\" ^ -v /tmp:/tmp:rw ^ -v /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock:rw ^ -d ^ --restart unless-stopped ^ quay.io/newrelic/synthetics-minion:latest Copy View the logs for your minion container: docker logs --follow YOUR_CONTAINER_NAME Copy When a message similar to Synthetics Minion is ready and servicing location YOUR_PRIVATE_LOCATION_LABEL appears, your CPM is up and ready to run monitors assigned to that location. Kubernetes start procedure Locate your private location key. Set up the a namespace for the CPM in your Kubernetes cluster: kubectl create namespace YOUR_NAMESPACE Copy Copy the Helm charts from the New Relic Helm repo. If you are copying the charts for the first time: helm repo add YOUR_REPO_NAME https://helm-charts.newrelic.com/charts Copy If you previously copied the Helm charts from the New Relic Helm repo, then get the latest: helm repo update Copy Install the CPM with the following Helm command: For a fresh installation of the CPM: helm install YOUR_CPM_NAME YOUR_REPO_NAME/synthetics-minion -n YOUR_NAMESPACE --set synthetics.privateLocationKey=YOUR_PRIVATE_LOCATION_KEY Copy To update an existing CPM installation: helm upgrade YOUR_CPM_NAME YOUR_REPO_NAME/synthetics-minion -n YOUR_NAMESPACE --set synthetics.privateLocationKey=YOUR_PRIVATE_LOCATION_KEY Copy Check if the minion pod is up and running: kubectl get -n YOUR_NAMESPACE pods Copy Once the status attribute of each pod is shown as running, your CPM is up and ready to run monitors assigned to your private location. Stop or delete the CPM On a Docker container system environment, use the Docker stop procedure to stop the CPM from running. On a Kubernetes container orchestration system environment, use the Kubernetes delete procedure to stop the CPM from running. Docker stop procedure You can stop a Docker container either by the container name, or the container ID. Container name stop for Linux, macOS, and Windows: docker stop YOUR_CONTAINER_NAME docker rm YOUR_CONTAINER_NAME Copy Container ID stop for Linux/macOS: In the examples the container is stopped and removed. To only stop the container, omit docker rm $CONTAINER_ID. CONTAINER_ID=$(docker ps -aqf name=YOUR_CONTAINER_NAME) docker stop $CONTAINER_ID docker rm $CONTAINER_ID Copy Container ID stop for Windows: In the examples the container is stopped and removed. To only stop the container, omit docker rm $CONTAINER_ID. FOR /F \"tokens=*\" %%CID IN ('docker ps -aqf name=YOUR_CONTAINER_NAME') do (SET CONTAINER_ID=%%CID) docker stop %CONTAINER_ID% docker rm %CONTAINER_ID% Copy Kubernetes delete procedure Get the MINION_POD_INSTALLATION_NAME of the minion pod you want to delete: helm list -n YOUR_NAMESPACE Copy Delete the minion pod: helm uninstall -n YOUR_NAMESPACE MINION_POD_INSTALLATION_NAME Copy Delete the namespace set up for the CPM in your Kubernetes cluster: kubectl delete namespace YOUR_NAMESPACE Copy Show help and examples Use these options as applicable: To get a list of the most commonly used run options directly in the command line interface, run the show help command. To show CPM usage examples as well as the list of all the available run options, run this command: docker run quay.io/newrelic/synthetics-minion:latest help Copy To keep track of Docker logs and verify the health of your monitors, see Containerized private minion (CPM) maintenance and monitoring. For a CPM in the Kubernetes container orchestration system environment, the following Helm show commands can be used to view the chart.yaml and the values.yaml, respectively: helm show chart YOUR_REPO_NAME/synthetics-minion Copy helm show values YOUR_REPO_NAME/synthetics-minion Copy Show license information To show the licensing information for the open source software that we use in the CPM, run the LICENSE command. Run this command to view license information for CPM versions 2.2.27 or higher: docker run quay.io/newrelic/synthetics-minion:latest LICENSE Copy Some of our open-source software is listed under multiple software licenses, and in that case we have listed the license we've chosen to use. Our license information is also available in the our licenses documentation. Configure CPM You can configure the containerized private minion with custom npm modules, preserve data between launches, use environment variables, and more. For more information, see CPM configuration. Networks For both Docker and Kubernetes, the CPM and its runner containers will inherit network settings from the host. For an example of this on a Docker container system environment, see the Docker site. A new bridge network is created for each runner container. This means networking command options like --network and --dns passed to the CPM container at launch (such as through Docker run commands on a Docker container system environment) are not inherited or used by the runner containers. When these networks are created, they pull from the default IP address pool configured for daemon. For an example of this on a Docker container system environment, see the Docker site. Typically, the runner network is removed after the check is completed. However, if a CPM exits while a check is still running, or exits in another unexpected circumstance, these networks may get orphaned. This can potentially use up IP address space that is available to the Docker daemon. If this happens, you may see INTERNAL ENGINE ERROR code: 31 entries in your CPM logging when trying to create a new runner container. To clean these up in Docker container system environments only, run docker network prune. Security, sandboxing, and running as non-root By default, the software running inside a CPM is executed with root user privileges. This is suitable for most scenarios, as the execution is sandboxed. In a Docker container system environment: To change the default AppArmor profile used by containers that CPM spawns to run monitors, see the environment variable MINION_RUNNER_APPARMOR (CPM version 3.0.3 or higher) or MINION_DOCKER_RUNNER_APPARMOR (CPM version up to v3.0.2). To run the CPM as a non-root user, additional steps are required: Run as non-root user for Docker For more information, see Docker's official documentation about security and AppArmor security profiles. If your environment requires you to run the CPM as a non-root user, follow this procedure. In the following example, the non-root user is my_user. Ensure that my_user can use the Docker engine on the host: Verify that my_user belongs to the \"docker\" system group. OR Enable the Docker TCP socket option, and pass the DOCKER_HOST environment variable to CPM. Verify that my_user has read/write permissions to all the directories and volumes passed to CPM. To set these permission, use the chmod command. Get the uid of my_user for use in the run command: id -u my_user. Once these conditions are met, use the option \"-u <uid>:<gid>\" when launching CPM: docker run ... -u 1002 ... Copy OR docker run ... -u 1002 -e DOCKER_HOST=http://localhost:2375 ... Copy Docker image repository A single CPM Docker image serves both the Docker container system environment and Kubernetes container orchestration system environment. The Docker image is hosted on quay.io. To make sure your Docker image is up-to-date, see the quay.io newrelic/synthetics-minion repository. Additional considerations for CPM connection Connection Description CPMs without Internet access A CPM can operate without access to the internet, but with some exceptions. The public internet health check can be disabled using the environment variables named MINION_NETWORK_HEALTHCHECK_DISABLED for a Docker container system environment or synthetics.minionNetworkHealthCheckDisabled for a Kubernetes container orchestration system environment. The CPM needs to be able to contact the \"synthetics-horde.nr-data.net\" domain. This is necessary for it to report data to New Relic and to receive monitors to execute. Ask your network administration if this is a problem and how to set up exceptions. Communicate with Synthetics via a proxy To set up communication with New Relic by proxy, use the environment variables named MINION_API_PROXY*. Arguments passed at launch This applies to a Docker container environment only. Arguments passed to the CPM container at launch do not get passed on to the containers spawned by the CPM. Docker has no concept of \"inheritance\" or a \"hierarchy\" of containers, and we don't copy the configuration that is passed from CPM to the monitor-running containers. The only shared configuration between them is the one set at the Docker daemon level.",

      "body": "Synthetic monitors are API checks or virtual browser instances that monitor your website, recording each check in detail. They can also: Capture aggregate numbers, including an overview or summary for ping monitors. Provide detailed statistics for each page resource, and downtime incidents. Collect custom response codes for more detail on your monitor runs. You'll be able to add and configure synthetic monitors to suit your environnment after you create a New Relic account. (It's free, forever!) Add a monitor You can add several types of synthetic monitors: Ping monitors ensure your website is responding, while simple browser monitors send real browsers to check your website. For more complex monitoring, scripted browser monitors verify that specific resources are present, while API tests verify your API endpoint. The default timeout for a new monitor is 180 seconds. To learn how to use our step monitor to build complex workflow validation scripts without writing any code, watch this short YouTube video (approx. 3:20 minutes). Add a ping or simple browser monitor Go to one.newrelic.com > Synthetics > Create monitor. Specify a monitor type, name, and URL (may be any valid HTTP or HTTPS URL). Optional: Add a validation string or Advanced options: A validation string is available for ping and simple browser. This option enables substring monitoring for response validation. Verify SSL is available for ping and simple browser. This option verifies the validity of the SSL certificate chain. It can be duplicated by running the following syntax: openssl s_client -servername {YOUR_HOSTNAME} -connect {YOUR_HOSTNAME}:443 -CApath /etc/ssl/certs -verify_hostname {YOUR_HOSTNAME} > /dev/null Copy If a non-zero exit code is returned, the monitor will fail. The Bypass HEAD request option is available for ping. This option skips the default HEAD request and instead uses the GET verb with a ping check. Redirect is Failure is available for ping. If a redirect result occurs when Redirect is Failure is enabled, New Relic Synthetics will categorize the result as a failure, rather than following the redirect and checking the resulting URL. Select the locations from which you want your monitor to run. Choose a frequency to determine how often each location will run your monitor. Optional: Set up alert notifications. Select Create my monitor to confirm. Generate some traffic and wait a few minutes, then check your monitor from the Monitors index. Add a scripted browser or API test monitor Go to one.newrelic.com > Synthetics > Create monitor. Specify a monitor type and name. Select the locations from which you want your monitor to run. Choose a frequency to determine how often each location will run your monitor. Optional: Set up alert notifications. Select Next: Write your script to create a script for your scripted browser or API test, then select Validate to verify your syntax. Tip For complex scripts, validation may take up to one minute. Select Create my monitor to confirm. Generate some traffic and wait a few minutes, then check your monitor from the Monitors index. Add a step monitor Go to one.newrelic.com > Synthetics > Create monitor. Select step monitor as the monitor type. Specify a name and choose a frequency to determine how often each location will run your monitor. Select the locations from which you want your monitor to run. Build your monitor by selecting from the preconfigured steps at the bottom of the UI: Navigate to a URL Type text Click an element Assert text Assert an element Secure a credential Use the instructions on the right side of the UI to help locate elements by CSS class, HTML ID, link text, or XPath. Select Save monitor to confirm. Generate some traffic and wait a few minutes, then check your monitor from the Monitors index. Add a certificate check monitor Go to one.newrelic.com > Synthetics > Create monitor. Select the certificate check monitor type. Specify a name and enter the domain you'd like to monitor. Enter the number of days it takes for your certificate to expire. Select the period to determine your monitor's frequency. Optional: Add tags to help you find this monitor later. Select the locations from which you want your monitor to run, and then click Save monitor to confirm. Generate some traffic and wait a few minutes, then check your monitor from the Monitors index. Add a broken links monitor Go to one.newrelic.com > Synthetics > Create monitor. Select the broken links check monitor type. Specify a name and enter the URL you'd like to monitor (may be any valid HTTP or HTTPS URL). Select the period to determine your monitor's frequency. Optional: Add tags to help you find this monitor later. Select the locations from which you want your monitor to run, and then click Save monitor to confirm. Generate some traffic and wait a few minutes, then check your monitor from the Monitors index. Tip You can also add monitors with the Synthetics REST API. For example, you can create a GET request to the monitor you want to use as the source for configuration, then use those key values to use in a POST to \"copy\" and create a new monitor. Edit a monitor You cannot change a monitor's type after the monitor is created, but you can edit other monitor settings. From the Monitors tab in one.newrelic.com > Synthetics, select the monitor you want to edit. In the side menu, select a link to change the following settings: Select Settings > General to edit name, Apdex T, URL, locations, frequency, and advanced options. For Scripted browser and API test monitors, select Settings > Script to edit your monitor script. For synthetic monitoring alerts, click Manage alerts. Select Save changes to confirm. Delete a monitor You must have Admin privileges in order to delete a monitor. To delete a monitor: From the Monitors tab in one.newrelic.com > Synthetics, select the monitor you want to edit. From the selected monitor, select Settings > General. Scroll to the bottom of the page and select the trash can icon. Tip You can also delete a monitor with the Synthetics REST API. Monitor settings When configuring monitors, the following settings are available: Type Select the type of monitor you want to create. A monitor's type can't be changed after the monitor is created. Ping: Specify a single URL to monitor for availability. New Relic will check this URL via HEAD or GET requests. The non-configurable timeout for this monitor is 60 seconds. Simple browser: Specify a single URL to monitor via real browser. Once each frequency interval, New Relic will check this URL via a Selenium-powered Google Chrome browser. The non-configurable timeout for this monitor is 60 seconds. Scripted browser: Create a script to drive a Selenium-powered Google Chrome browser. The browser follows each step in the script to verify that complex behavior is working as expected (for example, searching a website, then clicking one of the search results). The non-configurable timeout for this monitor is 180 seconds. API test: Create an API script to ensure your API endpoint is working correctly. For more information, see Write API tests. The non-configurable timeout for this monitor is 180 seconds. Monitor name Defines a name for the monitor. Monitor names cannot contain unencoded angle brackets (< >). To include angle brackets in a monitor name, encode them as HTML bracket entities (&lt; &gt;) in the UI or API. Location Select the locations where you want your monitor to run. Select more locations to ensure that your application is available to users around the world. If you have any private locations, they will be listed here too. You can use the Synthetics API location endpoint to retrieve a list of valid locations for your account. Your monitor will run one check from each selected location during each frequency interval. For example, if you select three locations and define a frequency of 15 minutes, your monitor will run three checks in each 15 minute period (or 8,640 checks per month). Frequency Select how often the monitor runs, in increments of minutes, hours, or 1 day. This frequency applies to each location. For example, if you select three locations and a Frequency of 15 minutes, your monitor will run three checks, on average every 5 minutes, in each 15 minute period (or 8,640 checks per month). Alerts Specify an email address to receive alerts when a monitor fails. Or, attach a monitor to an existing alert policy for more notification options. For more information, see Alerting for synthetic monitoring. Apdex T Customize the Apdex T for this monitor. This setting is only available when editing the settings for an existing monitor, not when creating a new monitor. Change the Apdex T from the default 7 seconds for more accurate Apdex scores in your SLA reports. For example, if you have a very long scripted browser, you might adjust the Apdex T to 15 seconds to more closely reflect the usual completion time. Similarly, a good Apdex T for a simple browser check might be only 2 seconds. Response Validation (optional) Specify text to search for on the page. When using simple browser or ping monitor types, there is a 1MB (10^6 bytes) limit on the page load. See a history of monitor changes You can use New Relic One to see a history of recent changes to synthetic monitors and what users changed them.",

      "body": "You can use New Relic's containerized private minions (CPM). These are Docker container-based private minions that accept and execute synthetic monitors against your private locations. The CPM can operate in a Docker container system environment or a Kubernetes container orchestration system environment. The CPM will auto-detect its environment to select the appropriate operating mode. General private minion features Because the CPM operates as a container instead of a virtual machine, it delivers many features: Easy to install, start, and update Runs on: Linux macOS Windows Enhanced security and support for non-root user execution Ability to leverage a Docker container as a sandbox environment Customizable monitor check timeout Custom provided modules for scripted monitor types Kubernetes-specific features Also, the CPM delivers the following features in a Kubernetes environment: Integrates with the Kubernetes API to delegate runtime lifecycle management to Kubernetes Does not require privileged access to the Docker socket Supports hosted and on-premise Kubernetes clusters Supports various container engines such as Docker and Containerd Deployable via Helm charts as well as configuration YAMLs Allows job (ping vs. non-ping checks) based resource allocation for optimum resource management Observability offered via the New Relic One Kubernetes cluster explorer System requirements and compatibility To host CPMs, your system must meet the minimum requirements for the chosen system environment. Caution Do not modify any CPM files. New Relic is not liable for any modifications you make. For more information, contact your account representative or a New Relic technical sales rep. Docker container system environment requirements Compatibility for Requirements Operating system Linux kernel: 3.10 or higher. macOS: 10.11 or higher. Windows: Windows 10 64-bit or higher. You must also configure Docker to run Linux containers in order for CPMs to work on Windows systems. Processor A modern, multi-core CPU Memory 2.5 GiB of RAM per CPU core (dedicated) Disk space A minimum of 10 GB per host Docker version Docker 17.12.1-ce or higher Private location key You must have a private location key Caution The Docker CPM is not designed for use with container orchestrators like AWS ECS, Docker Swarm, Apache Mesos, Azure Container Instances, etc. Running the Docker CPM in a container orchestrator will result in unexpected issues because it is itself a container orchestrator. If you're using container orchestration, see our Kubernetes CPM requirements. Kubernetes container orchestration system environment requirements (CPM v3.0.0 or higher) Compatibility for Requirements Operating system Linux kernel: 3.10 or higher macOS: 10.11 or higher Windows: Windows 10 64-bit or higher Processor A modern, multi-core CPU Minion pod CPU (vCPU/Core): 0.5 up to 0.75 Memory: 800 Mi up to 1.6 Gi Resources allocated to a Minion pod are user configurable. Runner pod CPU (vCPU/Core): 0.5 up to 1 Memory: 1.25 Gi up to 3 Gi For a scripted API check, 1.25 Gi will be requested with a limit of 2.5 Gi. For a simple browser or scripted browser check, 2 Gi will be requested with a limit of 3 Gi. Additional considerations: Resources allocated to a runner pod are not user configurable. The maximum limit-request resource ratio for both CPU and memory is 2. Disk space Persistent volume (PV) of at least 10 Gi in size Note that if a ReadWriteOnce (RWO) PV is provided to the minion, an implicit node affinity will be established to ensure the minion and the runner containers are scheduled on the same node. This is required to allow the minion and the associated runners access to the PV, as an RWO PV can be accessed only by a single node in the cluster. Kubernetes version We recommend that your Kubernetes cluster supports Kubernetes v1.15. Caution We have identified a compatibility issue with Kubernetes v1.21+. A workaround is available by disabling the BoundServiceAccountTokenVolume feature gate on the cluster. Private location key You must have a private location key Helm Follow installation instructions for Helm v3 for your OS. Kubectl Follow installation instructions for Kubectl for your OS. To view versions, dependencies, default values for how many runner pods start with each minion, the Persistent volume access mode, and more, please see Show help and examples below. Private location key Before launching CPMs, you must have a private location key. Your CPM uses the key to authenticate against New Relic and run monitors associated with that private location. To find the key for existing private location: Go to one.newrelic.com > Synthetics > Private locations. In the Private locations index, locate the private location you want your CPM to be assigned to. Note the key associated with the private location with the key icon. Sandboxing and Docker dependencies Sandboxing and Docker dependencies are applicable to the CPM in a Docker container system environment. Docker dependencies The CPM runs in Docker and is able to leverage Docker as a sandboxing technology. This ensures complete isolation of the monitor execution, which improves security, reliability, and repeatability. Every time a scripted or browser monitor is executed, the CPM creates a brand new Docker container to run it in called a runner. The minion container needs to be configured to communicate with the Docker engine in order to spawn additional runner containers. Each spawned container is then dedicated to run a check associated with the synthetic monitor running on the private location the minion container is associated with. There are two crucial dependencies at launch. To enable sandboxing, ensure that: Your writable and executable directory is mounted at /tmp. The writable directory can be any directory you want the CPM to write into, but New Relic recommends the system's own /tmp to make things easy. Your writable Docker UNIX socket is mounted at /var/run/docker.sock or DOCKER_HOST environment variable. For more information, see Docker's Daemon socket option. Caution Core count on the host determines how many runner containers the CPM can run concurrently on the host. Since memory requirements are scaled to the expected count of runner containers, we recommend not running multiple CPMs on the same host to avoid resource contention. For additional information on sandboxing and running as a root or non-root user, see Security, sandboxing, and running as non-root. Install and update CPM versions Both installing and updating the CPM use the same command to pull the latest Docker image from the Quay.io repository where the CPM Docker image is hosted. Go to quay.io/repository/newrelic/synthetics-minion for a list of all the releases. CPM images are also hosted on Docker Hub. Go to hub.docker.com/r/newrelic/synthetics-minion/tags for a list of all the releases. Unless hosting the images in a local image repository, connections to either quay.io or docker.io will need to be allowed through your firewall in order for Docker to pull the synthetics-minion and synthetics-minion-runner images. The \"runner\" image is pulled automatically on startup of the synthetics-minion container. See Docker environment configuration and Kubernetes environment configuration for details on how to set a local repository and the runner registry endpoint. Start the CPM To start the CPM, follow the applicable Docker or Kubernetes instructions. Docker start procedure Locate your private location key. Ensure you've enabled Docker dependencies for sandboxing and installed CPM on your system. Run the appropriate script for your system. Tailor the common defaults for /tmp and /var/run/docker.sock in the following examples to match your system. Linux/macOS: docker run \\ --name YOUR_CONTAINER_NAME \\ -e \"MINION_PRIVATE_LOCATION_KEY=YOUR_PRIVATE_LOCATION_KEY\" \\ -v /tmp:/tmp:rw \\ -v /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock:rw \\ -d \\ --restart unless-stopped \\ quay.io/newrelic/synthetics-minion:latest Copy Windows: docker run ^ --name YOUR_CONTAINER_NAME ^ -e \"MINION_PRIVATE_LOCATION_KEY=YOUR_PRIVATE_LOCATION_KEY\" ^ -v /tmp:/tmp:rw ^ -v /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock:rw ^ -d ^ --restart unless-stopped ^ quay.io/newrelic/synthetics-minion:latest Copy View the logs for your minion container: docker logs --follow YOUR_CONTAINER_NAME Copy When a message similar to Synthetics Minion is ready and servicing location YOUR_PRIVATE_LOCATION_LABEL appears, your CPM is up and ready to run monitors assigned to that location. Kubernetes start procedure Locate your private location key. Set up the a namespace for the CPM in your Kubernetes cluster: kubectl create namespace YOUR_NAMESPACE Copy Copy the Helm charts from the New Relic Helm repo. If you are copying the charts for the first time: helm repo add YOUR_REPO_NAME https://helm-charts.newrelic.com/charts Copy If you previously copied the Helm charts from the New Relic Helm repo, then get the latest: helm repo update Copy Install the CPM with the following Helm command: For a fresh installation of the CPM: helm install YOUR_CPM_NAME YOUR_REPO_NAME/synthetics-minion -n YOUR_NAMESPACE --set synthetics.privateLocationKey=YOUR_PRIVATE_LOCATION_KEY Copy To update an existing CPM installation: helm upgrade YOUR_CPM_NAME YOUR_REPO_NAME/synthetics-minion -n YOUR_NAMESPACE --set synthetics.privateLocationKey=YOUR_PRIVATE_LOCATION_KEY Copy Check if the minion pod is up and running: kubectl get -n YOUR_NAMESPACE pods Copy Once the status attribute of each pod is shown as running, your CPM is up and ready to run monitors assigned to your private location. Stop or delete the CPM On a Docker container system environment, use the Docker stop procedure to stop the CPM from running. On a Kubernetes container orchestration system environment, use the Kubernetes delete procedure to stop the CPM from running. Docker stop procedure You can stop a Docker container either by the container name, or the container ID. Container name stop for Linux, macOS, and Windows: docker stop YOUR_CONTAINER_NAME docker rm YOUR_CONTAINER_NAME Copy Container ID stop for Linux/macOS: In the examples the container is stopped and removed. To only stop the container, omit docker rm $CONTAINER_ID. CONTAINER_ID=$(docker ps -aqf name=YOUR_CONTAINER_NAME) docker stop $CONTAINER_ID docker rm $CONTAINER_ID Copy Container ID stop for Windows: In the examples the container is stopped and removed. To only stop the container, omit docker rm $CONTAINER_ID. FOR /F \"tokens=*\" %%CID IN ('docker ps -aqf name=YOUR_CONTAINER_NAME') do (SET CONTAINER_ID=%%CID) docker stop %CONTAINER_ID% docker rm %CONTAINER_ID% Copy Kubernetes delete procedure Get the MINION_POD_INSTALLATION_NAME of the minion pod you want to delete: helm list -n YOUR_NAMESPACE Copy Delete the minion pod: helm uninstall -n YOUR_NAMESPACE MINION_POD_INSTALLATION_NAME Copy Delete the namespace set up for the CPM in your Kubernetes cluster: kubectl delete namespace YOUR_NAMESPACE Copy Show help and examples Use these options as applicable: To get a list of the most commonly used run options directly in the command line interface, run the show help command. To show CPM usage examples as well as the list of all the available run options, run this command: docker run quay.io/newrelic/synthetics-minion:latest help Copy To keep track of Docker logs and verify the health of your monitors, see Containerized private minion (CPM) maintenance and monitoring. For a CPM in the Kubernetes container orchestration system environment, the following Helm show commands can be used to view the chart.yaml and the values.yaml, respectively: helm show chart YOUR_REPO_NAME/synthetics-minion Copy helm show values YOUR_REPO_NAME/synthetics-minion Copy Show license information To show the licensing information for the open source software that we use in the CPM, run the LICENSE command. Run this command to view license information for CPM versions 2.2.27 or higher: docker run quay.io/newrelic/synthetics-minion:latest LICENSE Copy Some of our open-source software is listed under multiple software licenses, and in that case we have listed the license we've chosen to use. Our license information is also available in the our licenses documentation. Configure CPM You can configure the containerized private minion with custom npm modules, preserve data between launches, use environment variables, and more. For more information, see CPM configuration. Networks For both Docker and Kubernetes, the CPM and its runner containers will inherit network settings from the host. For an example of this on a Docker container system environment, see the Docker site. A new bridge network is created for each runner container. This means networking command options like --network and --dns passed to the CPM container at launch (such as through Docker run commands on a Docker container system environment) are not inherited or used by the runner containers. When these networks are created, they pull from the default IP address pool configured for daemon. For an example of this on a Docker container system environment, see the Docker site. Typically, the runner network is removed after the check is completed. However, if a CPM exits while a check is still running, or exits in another unexpected circumstance, these networks may get orphaned. This can potentially use up IP address space that is available to the Docker daemon. If this happens, you may see INTERNAL ENGINE ERROR code: 31 entries in your CPM logging when trying to create a new runner container. To clean these up in Docker container system environments only, run docker network prune. Security, sandboxing, and running as non-root By default, the software running inside a CPM is executed with root user privileges. This is suitable for most scenarios, as the execution is sandboxed. In a Docker container system environment: To change the default AppArmor profile used by containers that CPM spawns to run monitors, see the environment variable MINION_RUNNER_APPARMOR (CPM version 3.0.3 or higher) or MINION_DOCKER_RUNNER_APPARMOR (CPM version up to v3.0.2). To run the CPM as a non-root user, additional steps are required: Run as non-root user for Docker For more information, see Docker's official documentation about security and AppArmor security profiles. If your environment requires you to run the CPM as a non-root user, follow this procedure. In the following example, the non-root user is my_user. Ensure that my_user can use the Docker engine on the host: Verify that my_user belongs to the \"docker\" system group. OR Enable the Docker TCP socket option, and pass the DOCKER_HOST environment variable to CPM. Verify that my_user has read/write permissions to all the directories and volumes passed to CPM. To set these permission, use the chmod command. Get the uid of my_user for use in the run command: id -u my_user. Once these conditions are met, use the option \"-u <uid>:<gid>\" when launching CPM: docker run ... -u 1002 ... Copy OR docker run ... -u 1002 -e DOCKER_HOST=http://localhost:2375 ... Copy Docker image repository A single CPM Docker image serves both the Docker container system environment and Kubernetes container orchestration system environment. The Docker image is hosted on quay.io. To make sure your Docker image is up-to-date, see the quay.io newrelic/synthetics-minion repository. Additional considerations for CPM connection Connection Description CPMs without Internet access A CPM can operate without access to the internet, but with some exceptions. The public internet health check can be disabled using the environment variables named MINION_NETWORK_HEALTHCHECK_DISABLED for a Docker container system environment or synthetics.minionNetworkHealthCheckDisabled for a Kubernetes container orchestration system environment. The CPM needs to be able to contact the \"synthetics-horde.nr-data.net\" domain. This is necessary for it to report data to New Relic and to receive monitors to execute. Ask your network administration if this is a problem and how to set up exceptions. Communicate with Synthetics via a proxy To set up communication with New Relic by proxy, use the environment variables named MINION_API_PROXY*. Arguments passed at launch This applies to a Docker container environment only. Arguments passed to the CPM container at launch do not get passed on to the containers spawned by the CPM. Docker has no concept of \"inheritance\" or a \"hierarchy\" of containers, and we don't copy the configuration that is passed from CPM to the monitor-running containers. The only shared configuration between them is the one set at the Docker daemon level.",

      "body": "Synthetic monitors are API checks or virtual browser instances that monitor your website, recording each check in detail. They can also: Capture aggregate numbers, including an overview or summary for ping monitors. Provide detailed statistics for each page resource, and downtime incidents. Collect custom response codes for more detail on your monitor runs. You'll be able to add and configure synthetic monitors to suit your environnment after you create a New Relic account. (It's free, forever!) Add a monitor You can add several types of synthetic monitors: Ping monitors ensure your website is responding, while simple browser monitors send real browsers to check your website. For more complex monitoring, scripted browser monitors verify that specific resources are present, while API tests verify your API endpoint. The default timeout for a new monitor is 180 seconds. To learn how to use our step monitor to build complex workflow validation scripts without writing any code, watch this short YouTube video (approx. 3:20 minutes). Add a ping or simple browser monitor Go to one.newrelic.com > Synthetics > Create monitor. Specify a monitor type, name, and URL (may be any valid HTTP or HTTPS URL). Optional: Add a validation string or Advanced options: A validation string is available for ping and simple browser. This option enables substring monitoring for response validation. Verify SSL is available for ping and simple browser. This option verifies the validity of the SSL certificate chain. It can be duplicated by running the following syntax: openssl s_client -servername {YOUR_HOSTNAME} -connect {YOUR_HOSTNAME}:443 -CApath /etc/ssl/certs -verify_hostname {YOUR_HOSTNAME} > /dev/null Copy If a non-zero exit code is returned, the monitor will fail. The Bypass HEAD request option is available for ping. This option skips the default HEAD request and instead uses the GET verb with a ping check. Redirect is Failure is available for ping. If a redirect result occurs when Redirect is Failure is enabled, New Relic Synthetics will categorize the result as a failure, rather than following the redirect and checking the resulting URL. Select the locations from which you want your monitor to run. Choose a frequency to determine how often each location will run your monitor. Optional: Set up alert notifications. Select Create my monitor to confirm. Generate some traffic and wait a few minutes, then check your monitor from the Monitors index. Add a scripted browser or API test monitor Go to one.newrelic.com > Synthetics > Create monitor. Specify a monitor type and name. Select the locations from which you want your monitor to run. Choose a frequency to determine how often each location will run your monitor. Optional: Set up alert notifications. Select Next: Write your script to create a script for your scripted browser or API test, then select Validate to verify your syntax. Tip For complex scripts, validation may take up to one minute. Select Create my monitor to confirm. Generate some traffic and wait a few minutes, then check your monitor from the Monitors index. Add a step monitor Go to one.newrelic.com > Synthetics > Create monitor. Select step monitor as the monitor type. Specify a name and choose a frequency to determine how often each location will run your monitor. Select the locations from which you want your monitor to run. Build your monitor by selecting from the preconfigured steps at the bottom of the UI: Navigate to a URL Type text Click an element Assert text Assert an element Secure a credential Use the instructions on the right side of the UI to help locate elements by CSS class, HTML ID, link text, or XPath. Select Save monitor to confirm. Generate some traffic and wait a few minutes, then check your monitor from the Monitors index. Add a certificate check monitor Go to one.newrelic.com > Synthetics > Create monitor. Select the certificate check monitor type. Specify a name and enter the domain you'd like to monitor. Enter the number of days it takes for your certificate to expire. Select the period to determine your monitor's frequency. Optional: Add tags to help you find this monitor later. Select the locations from which you want your monitor to run, and then click Save monitor to confirm. Generate some traffic and wait a few minutes, then check your monitor from the Monitors index. Add a broken links monitor Go to one.newrelic.com > Synthetics > Create monitor. Select the broken links check monitor type.

Optional: Add tags to help you find this monitor later. Select the locations from which you want your monitor to run, and then click Save monitor to confirm. Generate some traffic and wait a few minutes, then check your monitor from the Monitors index. Tip You can also add monitors with the Synthetics REST API. For example, you can create a GET request to the monitor you want to use as the source for configuration, then use those key values to use in a POST to \"copy\" and create a new monitor. Edit a monitor You cannot change a monitor's type after the monitor is created, but you can edit other monitor settings. From the Monitors tab in one.newrelic.com > Synthetics, select the monitor you want to edit. In the side menu, select a link to change the following settings: Select Settings > General to edit name, Apdex T, URL, locations, frequency, and advanced options. For Scripted browser and API test monitors, select Settings > Script to edit your monitor script. For synthetic monitoring alerts, click Manage alerts. Select Save changes to confirm. Delete a monitor You must have Admin privileges in order to delete a monitor. To delete a monitor: From the Monitors tab in one.newrelic.com > Synthetics, select the monitor you want to edit. From the selected monitor, select Settings > General. Scroll to the bottom of the page and select the trash can icon. Tip You can also delete a monitor with the Synthetics REST API. Monitor settings When configuring monitors, the following settings are available: Type Select the type of monitor you want to create. A monitor's type can't be changed after the monitor is created. Ping: Specify a single URL to monitor for availability. New Relic will check this URL via HEAD or GET requests. The non-configurable timeout for this monitor is 60 seconds. Simple browser: Specify a single URL to monitor via real browser. Once each frequency interval, New Relic will check this URL via a Selenium-powered Google Chrome browser. The non-configurable timeout for this monitor is 60 seconds. Scripted browser: Create a script to drive a Selenium-powered Google Chrome browser. The browser follows each step in the script to verify that complex behavior is working as expected (for example, searching a website, then clicking one of the search results). The non-configurable timeout for this monitor is 180 seconds. API test: Create an API script to ensure your API endpoint is working correctly. For more information, see Write API tests. The non-configurable timeout for this monitor is 180 seconds. Monitor name Defines a name for the monitor. Monitor names cannot contain unencoded angle brackets (< >). To include angle brackets in a monitor name, encode them as HTML bracket entities (&lt; &gt;) in the UI or API. Location Select the locations where you want your monitor to run. Select more locations to ensure that your application is available to users around the world. If you have any private locations, they will be listed here too. You can use the Synthetics API location endpoint to retrieve a list of valid locations for your account. Your monitor will run one check from each selected location during each frequency interval. For example, if you select three locations and define a frequency of 15 minutes, your monitor will run three checks in each 15 minute period (or 8,640 checks per month). Frequency Select how often the monitor runs, in increments of minutes, hours, or 1 day. This frequency applies to each location. For example, if you select three locations and a Frequency of 15 minutes, your monitor will run three checks, on average every 5 minutes, in each 15 minute period (or 8,640 checks per month). Alerts Specify an email address to receive alerts when a monitor fails. Or, attach a monitor to an existing alert policy for more notification options. For more information, see Alerting for synthetic monitoring. Apdex T Customize the Apdex T for this monitor.

      "body": "Synthetic monitors are API checks or virtual browser instances that monitor your website, recording each check in detail. They can also: Capture aggregate numbers, including an overview or summary for ping monitors. Provide detailed statistics for each page resource, and downtime incidents. Collect custom response codes for more detail on your monitor runs. You'll be able to add and configure synthetic monitors to suit your environnment after you create a New Relic account. (It's free, forever!) Add a monitor You can add several types of synthetic monitors: Ping monitors ensure your website is responding, while simple browser monitors send real browsers to check your website. For more complex monitoring, scripted browser monitors verify that specific resources are present, while API tests verify your API endpoint. The default timeout for a new monitor is 180 seconds. To learn how to use our step monitor to build complex workflow validation scripts without writing any code, watch this short YouTube video (approx. 3:20 minutes). Add a ping or simple browser monitor Go to one.newrelic.com > Synthetics > Create monitor. Specify a monitor type, name, and URL (may be any valid HTTP or HTTPS URL). Optional: Add a validation string or Advanced options: A validation string is available for ping and simple browser. This option enables substring monitoring for response validation. Verify SSL is available for ping and simple browser. This option verifies the validity of the SSL certificate chain. It can be duplicated by running the following syntax: openssl s_client -servername {YOUR_HOSTNAME} -connect {YOUR_HOSTNAME}:443 -CApath /etc/ssl/certs -verify_hostname {YOUR_HOSTNAME} > /dev/null Copy If a non-zero exit code is returned, the monitor will fail. The Bypass HEAD request option is available for ping. This option skips the default HEAD request and instead uses the GET verb with a ping check. Redirect is Failure is available for ping. If a redirect result occurs when Redirect is Failure is enabled, New Relic Synthetics will categorize the result as a failure, rather than following the redirect and checking the resulting URL. Select the locations from which you want your monitor to run. Choose a frequency to determine how often each location will run your monitor. Optional: Set up alert notifications. Select Create my monitor to confirm. Generate some traffic and wait a few minutes, then check your monitor from the Monitors index. Add a scripted browser or API test monitor Go to one.newrelic.com > Synthetics > Create monitor. Specify a monitor type and name. Select the locations from which you want your monitor to run. Choose a frequency to determine how often each location will run your monitor. Optional: Set up alert notifications. Select Next: Write your script to create a script for your scripted browser or API test, then select Validate to verify your syntax. Tip For complex scripts, validation may take up to one minute. Select Create my monitor to confirm. Generate some traffic and wait a few minutes, then check your monitor from the Monitors index. Add a step monitor Go to one.newrelic.com > Synthetics > Create monitor. Select step monitor as the monitor type. Specify a name and choose a frequency to determine how often each location will run your monitor. Select the locations from which you want your monitor to run. Build your monitor by selecting from the preconfigured steps at the bottom of the UI: Navigate to a URL Type text Click an element Assert text Assert an element Secure a credential Use the instructions on the right side of the UI to help locate elements by CSS class, HTML ID, link text, or XPath. Select Save monitor to confirm. Generate some traffic and wait a few minutes, then check your monitor from the Monitors index. Add a certificate check monitor Go to one.newrelic.com > Synthetics > Create monitor. Select the certificate check monitor type. Specify a name and enter the domain you'd like to monitor. Enter the number of days it takes for your certificate to expire. Select the period to determine your monitor's frequency. Optional: Add tags to help you find this monitor later. Select the locations from which you want your monitor to run, and then click Save monitor to confirm. Generate some traffic and wait a few minutes, then check your monitor from the Monitors index. Add a broken links monitor Go to one.newrelic.com > Synthetics > Create monitor. Select the broken links check monitor type. Specify a name and enter the URL you'd like to monitor (may be any valid HTTP or HTTPS URL). Select the period to determine your monitor's frequency. Optional: Add tags to help you find this monitor later. Select the locations from which you want your monitor to run, and then click Save monitor to confirm. Generate some traffic and wait a few minutes, then check your monitor from the Monitors index. Tip You can also add monitors with the Synthetics REST API. For example, you can create a GET request to the monitor you want to use as the source for configuration, then use those key values to use in a POST to \"copy\" and create a new monitor. Edit a monitor You cannot change a monitor's type after the monitor is created, but you can edit other monitor settings. From the Monitors tab in one.newrelic.com > Synthetics, select the monitor you want to edit. In the side menu, select a link to change the following settings: Select Settings > General to edit name, Apdex T, URL, locations, frequency, and advanced options. For Scripted browser and API test monitors, select Settings > Script to edit your monitor script. For synthetic monitoring alerts, click Manage alerts. Select Save changes to confirm. Delete a monitor You must have Admin privileges in order to delete a monitor. To delete a monitor: From the Monitors tab in one.newrelic.com > Synthetics, select the monitor you want to edit. From the selected monitor, select Settings > General. Scroll to the bottom of the page and select the trash can icon. Tip You can also delete a monitor with the Synthetics REST API. Monitor settings When configuring monitors, the following settings are available: Type Select the type of monitor you want to create. A monitor's type can't be changed after the monitor is created. Ping: Specify a single URL to monitor for availability. New Relic will check this URL via HEAD or GET requests. The non-configurable timeout for this monitor is 60 seconds. Simple browser: Specify a single URL to monitor via real browser. Once each frequency interval, New Relic will check this URL via a Selenium-powered Google Chrome browser. The non-configurable timeout for this monitor is 60 seconds. Scripted browser: Create a script to drive a Selenium-powered Google Chrome browser. The browser follows each step in the script to verify that complex behavior is working as expected (for example, searching a website, then clicking one of the search results). The non-configurable timeout for this monitor is 180 seconds. API test: Create an API script to ensure your API endpoint is working correctly. For more information, see Write API tests. The non-configurable timeout for this monitor is 180 seconds. Monitor name Defines a name for the monitor. Monitor names cannot contain unencoded angle brackets (< >). To include angle brackets in a monitor name, encode them as HTML bracket entities (&lt; &gt;) in the UI or API. Location Select the locations where you want your monitor to run. Select more locations to ensure that your application is available to users around the world. If you have any private locations, they will be listed here too. You can use the Synthetics API location endpoint to retrieve a list of valid locations for your account. Your monitor will run one check from each selected location during each frequency interval. For example, if you select three locations and define a frequency of 15 minutes, your monitor will run three checks in each 15 minute period (or 8,640 checks per month). Frequency Select how often the monitor runs, in increments of minutes, hours, or 1 day. This frequency applies to each location. For example, if you select three locations and a Frequency of 15 minutes, your monitor will run three checks, on average every 5 minutes, in each 15 minute period (or 8,640 checks per month). Alerts Specify an email address to receive alerts when a monitor fails. Or, attach a monitor to an existing alert policy for more notification options. For more information, see Alerting for synthetic monitoring. Apdex T Customize the Apdex T for this monitor. This setting is only available when editing the settings for an existing monitor, not when creating a new monitor. Change the Apdex T from the default 7 seconds for more accurate Apdex scores in your SLA reports. For example, if you have a very long scripted browser, you might adjust the Apdex T to 15 seconds to more closely reflect the usual completion time. Similarly, a good Apdex T for a simple browser check might be only 2 seconds. Response Validation (optional) Specify text to search for on the page. When using simple browser or ping monitor types, there is a 1MB (10^6 bytes) limit on the page load.

Replace \"accountId\": 1, with your New Relic account ID for each occurrence in the JSON code. Copy the Dashboard JSON from your text editor and import using one of the methods described above. Edit any charts that you'd like to use facet filtering with. Tip If your private locations exist in a parent account and Synthetics monitors in a sub account, insert the parent account ID for NRQL queries that use SyntheticPrivateLocationStatus and SyntheticsPrivateMinion, and the sub account ID for queries that use SyntheticCheck and SyntheticRequest. Are my private minions online? To answer this question, you can rely on attributes from the SyntheticsPrivateMinionevent. Private minions send this event to New Relic every 30 seconds. A simple way to check if your minions are online is to compare the unique count of minion IDs with the number of minions you expect to be online. To understand how many minions are reporting, run this example NRQL query: SELECT uniqueCount(minionId) FROM SyntheticsPrivateMinion WHERE minionLocation = '1-acme_okc_dc-309' Copy Using this query, you can create an alert condition to notify your team when fewer minions are reporting than expected. This condition is configured with a static threshold of 2 units, which means you will receive an alert if any of your minions are offline. You can verify that the alert policy works as expected by manually stopping one of your minions. Then, when the alert violation occurs, you will be notified by any notification channels that have been set up. Once the minion is restarted and it comes back online, the alert will recover. There are more robust ways to check whether minions are functioning correctly, but this query and condition simply and successfully handle the case where a machine fails, is accidentally decommissioned, or the minion process crashes. It also ensures that the minion can communicate with New Relic. Does my private location need more minions? To answer this question, you can use the checksPending attribute of the SyntheticsPrivateLocationStatus event. The checksPending attribute reflects the number of monitor checks that are scheduled (or \"queued\") but have yet to be accepted by a minion in the designated location. For a location with scheduled checks and no minions, this graph would grow linearly up and to the right. This metric is more complicated to monitor than uniqueCount(minionId) because a high value does not necessarily mean the location is in a bad state. As long as the metric is not growing linearly up and to the right (and checks are being run on schedule), the location is in a good state. This use case is perfect for baseline NRQL alert conditions, which allow you to monitor the deviation of a metric rather than its static value. For example: SELECT average(checksPending) FROM SyntheticsPrivateLocationStatus WHERE name = '1-acme_tokyo_dc-512' Copy To test this alert condition, schedule one-minute, browser-based monitors to run from your location. Browser-based jobs consume more resources than ping jobs, which is why they are a better fit for load simulation. New Relic will quickly notify you of a growing number of pending checks. After doubling the number of minions to handle the load, the alert recovers. For example, using the Synthetics private location dashboard example, notice the growth and decline of pending checks over the course of the incident and recovery. By using the NRQL condition, New Relic will notify you if and when the location needs more minion capacity. Can I check the status of a specific minion directly? You can also check how a minion is operating by contacting it directly. You can use a set of HTTP endpoints exposed by the minion to determine what the application is doing. In order to access these endpoints, bind ports 8080 and 8180 to ports on the host. For example, for Docker, use docker run -p 80:8080 -p 81:8180 ...): :8080/status/check: Details about internal health-checks the minion performs; HTTP 200 means \"healthy.\" :8080/status: Details about a minion's status; the same data is then published to Insights as a SyntheticsPrivateMinion event. :8180/: JVM application admin endpoints; an advanced view of a minion's internal state. This approach is not as automated or flexible as the checksPending example. However, if you have total network connectivity failure, this manual approach can help troubleshoot the situation.",

      "body": "You can use New Relic's containerized private minions (CPM). These are Docker container-based private minions that accept and execute synthetic monitors against your private locations. The CPM can operate in a Docker container system environment or a Kubernetes container orchestration system environment. The CPM will auto-detect its environment to select the appropriate operating mode. General private minion features Because the CPM operates as a container instead of a virtual machine, it delivers many features: Easy to install, start, and update Runs on: Linux macOS Windows Enhanced security and support for non-root user execution Ability to leverage a Docker container as a sandbox environment Customizable monitor check timeout Custom provided modules for scripted monitor types Kubernetes-specific features Also, the CPM delivers the following features in a Kubernetes environment: Integrates with the Kubernetes API to delegate runtime lifecycle management to Kubernetes Does not require privileged access to the Docker socket Supports hosted and on-premise Kubernetes clusters Supports various container engines such as Docker and Containerd Deployable via Helm charts as well as configuration YAMLs Allows job (ping vs. non-ping checks) based resource allocation for optimum resource management Observability offered via the New Relic One Kubernetes cluster explorer System requirements and compatibility To host CPMs, your system must meet the minimum requirements for the chosen system environment. Caution Do not modify any CPM files. New Relic is not liable for any modifications you make. For more information, contact your account representative or a New Relic technical sales rep. Docker container system environment requirements Compatibility for Requirements Operating system Linux kernel: 3.10 or higher. macOS: 10.11 or higher. Windows: Windows 10 64-bit or higher. You must also configure Docker to run Linux containers in order for CPMs to work on Windows systems. Processor A modern, multi-core CPU Memory 2.5 GiB of RAM per CPU core (dedicated) Disk space A minimum of 10 GB per host Docker version Docker 17.12.1-ce or higher Private location key You must have a private location key Caution The Docker CPM is not designed for use with container orchestrators like AWS ECS, Docker Swarm, Apache Mesos, Azure Container Instances, etc. Running the Docker CPM in a container orchestrator will result in unexpected issues because it is itself a container orchestrator. If you're using container orchestration, see our Kubernetes CPM requirements. Kubernetes container orchestration system environment requirements (CPM v3.0.0 or higher) Compatibility for Requirements Operating system Linux kernel: 3.10 or higher macOS: 10.11 or higher Windows: Windows 10 64-bit or higher Processor A modern, multi-core CPU Minion pod CPU (vCPU/Core): 0.5 up to 0.75 Memory: 800 Mi up to 1.6 Gi Resources allocated to a Minion pod are user configurable. Runner pod CPU (vCPU/Core): 0.5 up to 1 Memory: 1.25 Gi up to 3 Gi For a scripted API check, 1.25 Gi will be requested with a limit of 2.5 Gi. For a simple browser or scripted browser check, 2 Gi will be requested with a limit of 3 Gi. Additional considerations: Resources allocated to a runner pod are not user configurable. The maximum limit-request resource ratio for both CPU and memory is 2. Disk space Persistent volume (PV) of at least 10 Gi in size Note that if a ReadWriteOnce (RWO) PV is provided to the minion, an implicit node affinity will be established to ensure the minion and the runner containers are scheduled on the same node. This is required to allow the minion and the associated runners access to the PV, as an RWO PV can be accessed only by a single node in the cluster. Kubernetes version We recommend that your Kubernetes cluster supports Kubernetes v1.15. Caution We have identified a compatibility issue with Kubernetes v1.21+. A workaround is available by disabling the BoundServiceAccountTokenVolume feature gate on the cluster. Private location key You must have a private location key Helm Follow installation instructions for Helm v3 for your OS. Kubectl Follow installation instructions for Kubectl for your OS. To view versions, dependencies, default values for how many runner pods start with each minion, the Persistent volume access mode, and more, please see Show help and examples below. Private location key Before launching CPMs, you must have a private location key. Your CPM uses the key to authenticate against New Relic and run monitors associated with that private location. To find the key for existing private location: Go to one.newrelic.com > Synthetics > Private locations. In the Private locations index, locate the private location you want your CPM to be assigned to. Note the key associated with the private location with the key icon. Sandboxing and Docker dependencies Sandboxing and Docker dependencies are applicable to the CPM in a Docker container system environment. Docker dependencies The CPM runs in Docker and is able to leverage Docker as a sandboxing technology. This ensures complete isolation of the monitor execution, which improves security, reliability, and repeatability. Every time a scripted or browser monitor is executed, the CPM creates a brand new Docker container to run it in called a runner. The minion container needs to be configured to communicate with the Docker engine in order to spawn additional runner containers. Each spawned container is then dedicated to run a check associated with the synthetic monitor running on the private location the minion container is associated with. There are two crucial dependencies at launch. To enable sandboxing, ensure that: Your writable and executable directory is mounted at /tmp. The writable directory can be any directory you want the CPM to write into, but New Relic recommends the system's own /tmp to make things easy. Your writable Docker UNIX socket is mounted at /var/run/docker.sock or DOCKER_HOST environment variable. For more information, see Docker's Daemon socket option. Caution Core count on the host determines how many runner containers the CPM can run concurrently on the host. Since memory requirements are scaled to the expected count of runner containers, we recommend not running multiple CPMs on the same host to avoid resource contention. For additional information on sandboxing and running as a root or non-root user, see Security, sandboxing, and running as non-root. Install and update CPM versions Both installing and updating the CPM use the same command to pull the latest Docker image from the Quay.io repository where the CPM Docker image is hosted. Go to quay.io/repository/newrelic/synthetics-minion for a list of all the releases. CPM images are also hosted on Docker Hub. Go to hub.docker.com/r/newrelic/synthetics-minion/tags for a list of all the releases. Unless hosting the images in a local image repository, connections to either quay.io or docker.io will need to be allowed through your firewall in order for Docker to pull the synthetics-minion and synthetics-minion-runner images. The \"runner\" image is pulled automatically on startup of the synthetics-minion container. See Docker environment configuration and Kubernetes environment configuration for details on how to set a local repository and the runner registry endpoint. Start the CPM To start the CPM, follow the applicable Docker or Kubernetes instructions. Docker start procedure Locate your private location key. Ensure you've enabled Docker dependencies for sandboxing and installed CPM on your system. Run the appropriate script for your system. Tailor the common defaults for /tmp and /var/run/docker.sock in the following examples to match your system. Linux/macOS: docker run \\ --name YOUR_CONTAINER_NAME \\ -e \"MINION_PRIVATE_LOCATION_KEY=YOUR_PRIVATE_LOCATION_KEY\" \\ -v /tmp:/tmp:rw \\ -v /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock:rw \\ -d \\ --restart unless-stopped \\ quay.io/newrelic/synthetics-minion:latest Copy Windows: docker run ^ --name YOUR_CONTAINER_NAME ^ -e \"MINION_PRIVATE_LOCATION_KEY=YOUR_PRIVATE_LOCATION_KEY\" ^ -v /tmp:/tmp:rw ^ -v /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock:rw ^ -d ^ --restart unless-stopped ^ quay.io/newrelic/synthetics-minion:latest Copy View the logs for your minion container: docker logs --follow YOUR_CONTAINER_NAME Copy When a message similar to Synthetics Minion is ready and servicing location YOUR_PRIVATE_LOCATION_LABEL appears, your CPM is up and ready to run monitors assigned to that location. Kubernetes start procedure Locate your private location key. Set up the a namespace for the CPM in your Kubernetes cluster: kubectl create namespace YOUR_NAMESPACE Copy Copy the Helm charts from the New Relic Helm repo. If you are copying the charts for the first time: helm repo add YOUR_REPO_NAME https://helm-charts.newrelic.com/charts Copy If you previously copied the Helm charts from the New Relic Helm repo, then get the latest: helm repo update Copy Install the CPM with the following Helm command: For a fresh installation of the CPM: helm install YOUR_CPM_NAME YOUR_REPO_NAME/synthetics-minion -n YOUR_NAMESPACE --set synthetics.privateLocationKey=YOUR_PRIVATE_LOCATION_KEY Copy To update an existing CPM installation: helm upgrade YOUR_CPM_NAME YOUR_REPO_NAME/synthetics-minion -n YOUR_NAMESPACE --set synthetics.privateLocationKey=YOUR_PRIVATE_LOCATION_KEY Copy Check if the minion pod is up and running: kubectl get -n YOUR_NAMESPACE pods Copy Once the status attribute of each pod is shown as running, your CPM is up and ready to run monitors assigned to your private location. Stop or delete the CPM On a Docker container system environment, use the Docker stop procedure to stop the CPM from running. On a Kubernetes container orchestration system environment, use the Kubernetes delete procedure to stop the CPM from running. Docker stop procedure You can stop a Docker container either by the container name, or the container ID. Container name stop for Linux, macOS, and Windows: docker stop YOUR_CONTAINER_NAME docker rm YOUR_CONTAINER_NAME Copy Container ID stop for Linux/macOS: In the examples the container is stopped and removed. To only stop the container, omit docker rm $CONTAINER_ID. CONTAINER_ID=$(docker ps -aqf name=YOUR_CONTAINER_NAME) docker stop $CONTAINER_ID docker rm $CONTAINER_ID Copy Container ID stop for Windows: In the examples the container is stopped and removed. To only stop the container, omit docker rm $CONTAINER_ID. FOR /F \"tokens=*\" %%CID IN ('docker ps -aqf name=YOUR_CONTAINER_NAME') do (SET CONTAINER_ID=%%CID) docker stop %CONTAINER_ID% docker rm %CONTAINER_ID% Copy Kubernetes delete procedure Get the MINION_POD_INSTALLATION_NAME of the minion pod you want to delete: helm list -n YOUR_NAMESPACE Copy Delete the minion pod: helm uninstall -n YOUR_NAMESPACE MINION_POD_INSTALLATION_NAME Copy Delete the namespace set up for the CPM in your Kubernetes cluster: kubectl delete namespace YOUR_NAMESPACE Copy Show help and examples Use these options as applicable: To get a list of the most commonly used run options directly in the command line interface, run the show help command. To show CPM usage examples as well as the list of all the available run options, run this command: docker run quay.io/newrelic/synthetics-minion:latest help Copy To keep track of Docker logs and verify the health of your monitors, see Containerized private minion (CPM) maintenance and monitoring. For a CPM in the Kubernetes container orchestration system environment, the following Helm show commands can be used to view the chart.yaml and the values.yaml, respectively: helm show chart YOUR_REPO_NAME/synthetics-minion Copy helm show values YOUR_REPO_NAME/synthetics-minion Copy Show license information To show the licensing information for the open source software that we use in the CPM, run the LICENSE command. Run this command to view license information for CPM versions 2.2.27 or higher: docker run quay.io/newrelic/synthetics-minion:latest LICENSE Copy Some of our open-source software is listed under multiple software licenses, and in that case we have listed the license we've chosen to use. Our license information is also available in the our licenses documentation. Configure CPM You can configure the containerized private minion with custom npm modules, preserve data between launches, use environment variables, and more. For more information, see CPM configuration. Networks For both Docker and Kubernetes, the CPM and its runner containers will inherit network settings from the host. For an example of this on a Docker container system environment, see the Docker site. A new bridge network is created for each runner container. This means networking command options like --network and --dns passed to the CPM container at launch (such as through Docker run commands on a Docker container system environment) are not inherited or used by the runner containers. When these networks are created, they pull from the default IP address pool configured for daemon. For an example of this on a Docker container system environment, see the Docker site. Typically, the runner network is removed after the check is completed. However, if a CPM exits while a check is still running, or exits in another unexpected circumstance, these networks may get orphaned. This can potentially use up IP address space that is available to the Docker daemon. If this happens, you may see INTERNAL ENGINE ERROR code: 31 entries in your CPM logging when trying to create a new runner container. To clean these up in Docker container system environments only, run docker network prune. Security, sandboxing, and running as non-root By default, the software running inside a CPM is executed with root user privileges. This is suitable for most scenarios, as the execution is sandboxed. In a Docker container system environment: To change the default AppArmor profile used by containers that CPM spawns to run monitors, see the environment variable MINION_RUNNER_APPARMOR (CPM version 3.0.3 or higher) or MINION_DOCKER_RUNNER_APPARMOR (CPM version up to v3.0.2). To run the CPM as a non-root user, additional steps are required: Run as non-root user for Docker For more information, see Docker's official documentation about security and AppArmor security profiles. If your environment requires you to run the CPM as a non-root user, follow this procedure. In the following example, the non-root user is my_user. Ensure that my_user can use the Docker engine on the host: Verify that my_user belongs to the \"docker\" system group. OR Enable the Docker TCP socket option, and pass the DOCKER_HOST environment variable to CPM. Verify that my_user has read/write permissions to all the directories and volumes passed to CPM. To set these permission, use the chmod command. Get the uid of my_user for use in the run command: id -u my_user. Once these conditions are met, use the option \"-u <uid>:<gid>\" when launching CPM: docker run ... -u 1002 ... Copy OR docker run ... -u 1002 -e DOCKER_HOST=http://localhost:2375 ... Copy Docker image repository A single CPM Docker image serves both the Docker container system environment and Kubernetes container orchestration system environment. The Docker image is hosted on quay.io. To make sure your Docker image is up-to-date, see the quay.io newrelic/synthetics-minion repository. Additional considerations for CPM connection Connection Description CPMs without Internet access A CPM can operate without access to the internet, but with some exceptions. The public internet health check can be disabled using the environment variables named MINION_NETWORK_HEALTHCHECK_DISABLED for a Docker container system environment or synthetics.minionNetworkHealthCheckDisabled for a Kubernetes container orchestration system environment. The CPM needs to be able to contact the \"synthetics-horde.nr-data.net\" domain. This is necessary for it to report data to New Relic and to receive monitors to execute. Ask your network administration if this is a problem and how to set up exceptions. Communicate with Synthetics via a proxy To set up communication with New Relic by proxy, use the environment variables named MINION_API_PROXY*. Arguments passed at launch This applies to a Docker container environment only. Arguments passed to the CPM container at launch do not get passed on to the containers spawned by the CPM. Docker has no concept of \"inheritance\" or a \"hierarchy\" of containers, and we don't copy the configuration that is passed from CPM to the monitor-running containers. The only shared configuration between them is the one set at the Docker daemon level.",

      "body": "Synthetic monitors are API checks or virtual browser instances that monitor your website, recording each check in detail. They can also: Capture aggregate numbers, including an overview or summary for ping monitors. Provide detailed statistics for each page resource, and downtime incidents. Collect custom response codes for more detail on your monitor runs. You'll be able to add and configure synthetic monitors to suit your environnment after you create a New Relic account. (It's free, forever!) Add a monitor You can add several types of synthetic monitors: Ping monitors ensure your website is responding, while simple browser monitors send real browsers to check your website. For more complex monitoring, scripted browser monitors verify that specific resources are present, while API tests verify your API endpoint. The default timeout for a new monitor is 180 seconds. To learn how to use our step monitor to build complex workflow validation scripts without writing any code, watch this short YouTube video (approx. 3:20 minutes). Add a ping or simple browser monitor Go to one.newrelic.com > Synthetics > Create monitor. Specify a monitor type, name, and URL (may be any valid HTTP or HTTPS URL). Optional: Add a validation string or Advanced options: A validation string is available for ping and simple browser. This option enables substring monitoring for response validation. Verify SSL is available for ping and simple browser. This option verifies the validity of the SSL certificate chain. It can be duplicated by running the following syntax: openssl s_client -servername {YOUR_HOSTNAME} -connect {YOUR_HOSTNAME}:443 -CApath /etc/ssl/certs -verify_hostname {YOUR_HOSTNAME} > /dev/null Copy If a non-zero exit code is returned, the monitor will fail. The Bypass HEAD request option is available for ping. This option skips the default HEAD request and instead uses the GET verb with a ping check. Redirect is Failure is available for ping. If a redirect result occurs when Redirect is Failure is enabled, New Relic Synthetics will categorize the result as a failure, rather than following the redirect and checking the resulting URL. Select the locations from which you want your monitor to run. Choose a frequency to determine how often each location will run your monitor. Optional: Set up alert notifications. Select Create my monitor to confirm. Generate some traffic and wait a few minutes, then check your monitor from the Monitors index. Add a scripted browser or API test monitor Go to one.newrelic.com > Synthetics > Create monitor. Specify a monitor type and name. Select the locations from which you want your monitor to run. Choose a frequency to determine how often each location will run your monitor. Optional: Set up alert notifications. Select Next: Write your script to create a script for your scripted browser or API test, then select Validate to verify your syntax. Tip For complex scripts, validation may take up to one minute. Select Create my monitor to confirm. Generate some traffic and wait a few minutes, then check your monitor from the Monitors index. Add a step monitor Go to one.newrelic.com > Synthetics > Create monitor. Select step monitor as the monitor type. Specify a name and choose a frequency to determine how often each location will run your monitor. Select the locations from which you want your monitor to run. Build your monitor by selecting from the preconfigured steps at the bottom of the UI: Navigate to a URL Type text Click an element Assert text Assert an element Secure a credential Use the instructions on the right side of the UI to help locate elements by CSS class, HTML ID, link text, or XPath. Select Save monitor to confirm. Generate some traffic and wait a few minutes, then check your monitor from the Monitors index. Add a certificate check monitor Go to one.newrelic.com > Synthetics > Create monitor. Select the certificate check monitor type. Specify a name and enter the domain you'd like to monitor. Enter the number of days it takes for your certificate to expire. Select the period to determine your monitor's frequency. Optional: Add tags to help you find this monitor later. Select the locations from which you want your monitor to run, and then click Save monitor to confirm. Generate some traffic and wait a few minutes, then check your monitor from the Monitors index. Add a broken links monitor Go to one.newrelic.com > Synthetics > Create monitor. Select the broken links check monitor type. Specify a name and enter the URL you'd like to monitor (may be any valid HTTP or HTTPS URL). Select the period to determine your monitor's frequency. Optional: Add tags to help you find this monitor later. Select the locations from which you want your monitor to run, and then click Save monitor to confirm. Generate some traffic and wait a few minutes, then check your monitor from the Monitors index. Tip You can also add monitors with the Synthetics REST API. For example, you can create a GET request to the monitor you want to use as the source for configuration, then use those key values to use in a POST to \"copy\" and create a new monitor. Edit a monitor You cannot change a monitor's type after the monitor is created, but you can edit other monitor settings. From the Monitors tab in one.newrelic.com > Synthetics, select the monitor you want to edit. In the side menu, select a link to change the following settings: Select Settings > General to edit name, Apdex T, URL, locations, frequency, and advanced options. For Scripted browser and API test monitors, select Settings > Script to edit your monitor script. For synthetic monitoring alerts, click Manage alerts. Select Save changes to confirm. Delete a monitor You must have Admin privileges in order to delete a monitor. To delete a monitor: From the Monitors tab in one.newrelic.com > Synthetics, select the monitor you want to edit. From the selected monitor, select Settings > General. Scroll to the bottom of the page and select the trash can icon. Tip You can also delete a monitor with the Synthetics REST API. Monitor settings When configuring monitors, the following settings are available: Type Select the type of monitor you want to create. A monitor's type can't be changed after the monitor is created. Ping: Specify a single URL to monitor for availability. New Relic will check this URL via HEAD or GET requests. The non-configurable timeout for this monitor is 60 seconds. Simple browser: Specify a single URL to monitor via real browser. Once each frequency interval, New Relic will check this URL via a Selenium-powered Google Chrome browser. The non-configurable timeout for this monitor is 60 seconds. Scripted browser: Create a script to drive a Selenium-powered Google Chrome browser. The browser follows each step in the script to verify that complex behavior is working as expected (for example, searching a website, then clicking one of the search results). The non-configurable timeout for this monitor is 180 seconds. API test: Create an API script to ensure your API endpoint is working correctly. For more information, see Write API tests. The non-configurable timeout for this monitor is 180 seconds. Monitor name Defines a name for the monitor. Monitor names cannot contain unencoded angle brackets (< >). To include angle brackets in a monitor name, encode them as HTML bracket entities (&lt; &gt;) in the UI or API. Location Select the locations where you want your monitor to run. Select more locations to ensure that your application is available to users around the world. If you have any private locations, they will be listed here too. You can use the Synthetics API location endpoint to retrieve a list of valid locations for your account. Your monitor will run one check from each selected location during each frequency interval. For example, if you select three locations and define a frequency of 15 minutes, your monitor will run three checks in each 15 minute period (or 8,640 checks per month). Frequency Select how often the monitor runs, in increments of minutes, hours, or 1 day. This frequency applies to each location. For example, if you select three locations and a Frequency of 15 minutes, your monitor will run three checks, on average every 5 minutes, in each 15 minute period (or 8,640 checks per month). Alerts Specify an email address to receive alerts when a monitor fails. Or, attach a monitor to an existing alert policy for more notification options. For more information, see Alerting for synthetic monitoring. Apdex T Customize the Apdex T for this monitor. This setting is only available when editing the settings for an existing monitor, not when creating a new monitor. Change the Apdex T from the default 7 seconds for more accurate Apdex scores in your SLA reports. For example, if you have a very long scripted browser, you might adjust the Apdex T to 15 seconds to more closely reflect the usual completion time. Similarly, a good Apdex T for a simple browser check might be only 2 seconds. Response Validation (optional) Specify text to search for on the page. When using simple browser or ping monitor types, there is a 1MB (10^6 bytes) limit on the page load. See a history of monitor changes You can use New Relic One to see a history of recent changes to synthetic monitors and what users changed them.",

Kubernetes container orchestration system environment requirements (CPM v3.0.0 or higher) Compatibility for Requirements Operating system Linux kernel: 3.10 or higher macOS: 10.11 or higher Windows: Windows 10 64-bit or higher Processor A modern, multi-core CPU Minion pod CPU (vCPU/Core): 0.5 up to 0.75 Memory: 800 Mi up to 1.6 Gi Resources allocated to a Minion pod are user configurable. Runner pod CPU (vCPU/Core): 0.5 up to 1 Memory: 1.25 Gi up to 3 Gi For a scripted API check, 1.25 Gi will be requested with a limit of 2.5 Gi. For a simple browser or scripted browser check, 2 Gi will be requested with a limit of 3 Gi. Additional considerations: Resources allocated to a runner pod are not user configurable. The maximum limit-request resource ratio for both CPU and memory is 2. Disk space Persistent volume (PV) of at least 10 Gi in size Note that if a ReadWriteOnce (RWO) PV is provided to the minion, an implicit node affinity will be established to ensure the minion and the runner containers are scheduled on the same node. This is required to allow the minion and the associated runners access to the PV, as an RWO PV can be accessed only by a single node in the cluster. Kubernetes version We recommend that your Kubernetes cluster supports Kubernetes v1.15. Caution We have identified a compatibility issue with Kubernetes v1.21+. A workaround is available by disabling the BoundServiceAccountTokenVolume feature gate on the cluster. Private location key You must have a private location key Helm Follow installation instructions for Helm v3 for your OS. Kubectl Follow installation instructions for Kubectl for your OS. To view versions, dependencies, default values for how many runner pods start with each minion, the Persistent volume access mode, and more, please see Show help and examples below. Private location key Before launching CPMs, you must have a private location key. Your CPM uses the key to authenticate against New Relic and run monitors associated with that private location. To find the key for existing private location: Go to one.newrelic.com > Synthetics > Private locations. In the Private locations index, locate the private location you want your CPM to be assigned to. Note the key associated with the private location with the key icon. Sandboxing and Docker dependencies Sandboxing and Docker dependencies are applicable to the CPM in a Docker container system environment. Docker dependencies The CPM runs in Docker and is able to leverage Docker as a sandboxing technology. This ensures complete isolation of the monitor execution, which improves security, reliability, and repeatability. Every time a scripted or browser monitor is executed, the CPM creates a brand new Docker container to run it in called a runner. The minion container needs to be configured to communicate with the Docker engine in order to spawn additional runner containers. Each spawned container is then dedicated to run a check associated with the synthetic monitor running on the private location the minion container is associated with. There are two crucial dependencies at launch. To enable sandboxing, ensure that: Your writable and executable directory is mounted at /tmp. The writable directory can be any directory you want the CPM to write into, but New Relic recommends the system's own /tmp to make things easy. Your writable Docker UNIX socket is mounted at /var/run/docker.sock or DOCKER_HOST environment variable. For more information, see Docker's Daemon socket option. Caution Core count on the host determines how many runner containers the CPM can run concurrently on the host. Since memory requirements are scaled to the expected count of runner containers, we recommend not running multiple CPMs on the same host to avoid resource contention. For additional information on sandboxing and running as a root or non-root user, see Security, sandboxing, and running as non-root. Install and update CPM versions Both installing and updating the CPM use the same command to pull the latest Docker image from the Quay.io repository where the CPM Docker image is hosted. Go to quay.io/repository/newrelic/synthetics-minion for a list of all the releases. CPM images are also hosted on Docker Hub. Go to hub.docker.com/r/newrelic/synthetics-minion/tags for a list of all the releases. Unless hosting the images in a local image repository, connections to either quay.io or docker.io will need to be allowed through your firewall in order for Docker to pull the synthetics-minion and synthetics-minion-runner images. The \"runner\" image is pulled automatically on startup of the synthetics-minion container. See Docker environment configuration and Kubernetes environment configuration for details on how to set a local repository and the runner registry endpoint. Start the CPM To start the CPM, follow the applicable Docker or Kubernetes instructions. Docker start procedure Locate your private location key. Ensure you've enabled Docker dependencies for sandboxing and installed CPM on your system. Run the appropriate script for your system. Tailor the common defaults for /tmp and /var/run/docker.sock in the following examples to match your system. Linux/macOS: docker run \\ --name YOUR_CONTAINER_NAME \\ -e \"MINION_PRIVATE_LOCATION_KEY=YOUR_PRIVATE_LOCATION_KEY\" \\ -v /tmp:/tmp:rw \\ -v /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock:rw \\ -d \\ --restart unless-stopped \\ quay.io/newrelic/synthetics-minion:latest Copy Windows: docker run ^ --name YOUR_CONTAINER_NAME ^ -e \"MINION_PRIVATE_LOCATION_KEY=YOUR_PRIVATE_LOCATION_KEY\" ^ -v /tmp:/tmp:rw ^ -v /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock:rw ^ -d ^ --restart unless-stopped ^ quay.io/newrelic/synthetics-minion:latest Copy View the logs for your minion container: docker logs --follow YOUR_CONTAINER_NAME Copy When a message similar to Synthetics Minion is ready and servicing location YOUR_PRIVATE_LOCATION_LABEL appears, your CPM is up and ready to run monitors assigned to that location. Kubernetes start procedure Locate your private location key. Set up the a namespace for the CPM in your Kubernetes cluster: kubectl create namespace YOUR_NAMESPACE Copy Copy the Helm charts from the New Relic Helm repo. If you are copying the charts for the first time: helm repo add YOUR_REPO_NAME https://helm-charts.newrelic.com/charts Copy If you previously copied the Helm charts from the New Relic Helm repo, then get the latest: helm repo update Copy Install the CPM with the following Helm command: For a fresh installation of the CPM: helm install YOUR_CPM_NAME YOUR_REPO_NAME/synthetics-minion -n YOUR_NAMESPACE --set synthetics.privateLocationKey=YOUR_PRIVATE_LOCATION_KEY Copy To update an existing CPM installation: helm upgrade YOUR_CPM_NAME YOUR_REPO_NAME/synthetics-minion -n YOUR_NAMESPACE --set synthetics.privateLocationKey=YOUR_PRIVATE_LOCATION_KEY Copy Check if the minion pod is up and running: kubectl get -n YOUR_NAMESPACE pods Copy Once the status attribute of each pod is shown as running, your CPM is up and ready to run monitors assigned to your private location. Stop or delete the CPM On a Docker container system environment, use the Docker stop procedure to stop the CPM from running. On a Kubernetes container orchestration system environment, use the Kubernetes delete procedure to stop the CPM from running. Docker stop procedure You can stop a Docker container either by the container name, or the container ID. Container name stop for Linux, macOS, and Windows: docker stop YOUR_CONTAINER_NAME docker rm YOUR_CONTAINER_NAME Copy Container ID stop for Linux/macOS: In the examples the container is stopped and removed. To only stop the container, omit docker rm $CONTAINER_ID. CONTAINER_ID=$(docker ps -aqf name=YOUR_CONTAINER_NAME) docker stop $CONTAINER_ID docker rm $CONTAINER_ID Copy Container ID stop for Windows: In the examples the container is stopped and removed. To only stop the container, omit docker rm $CONTAINER_ID. FOR /F \"tokens=*\" %%CID IN ('docker ps -aqf name=YOUR_CONTAINER_NAME') do (SET CONTAINER_ID=%%CID) docker stop %CONTAINER_ID% docker rm %CONTAINER_ID% Copy Kubernetes delete procedure Get the MINION_POD_INSTALLATION_NAME of the minion pod you want to delete: helm list -n YOUR_NAMESPACE Copy Delete the minion pod: helm uninstall -n YOUR_NAMESPACE MINION_POD_INSTALLATION_NAME Copy Delete the namespace set up for the CPM in your Kubernetes cluster: kubectl delete namespace YOUR_NAMESPACE Copy Show help and examples Use these options as applicable: To get a list of the most commonly used run options directly in the command line interface, run the show help command. To show CPM usage examples as well as the list of all the available run options, run this command: docker run quay.io/newrelic/synthetics-minion:latest help Copy To keep track of Docker logs and verify the health of your monitors, see Containerized private minion (CPM) maintenance and monitoring. For a CPM in the Kubernetes container orchestration system environment, the following Helm show commands can be used to view the chart.yaml and the values.yaml, respectively: helm show chart YOUR_REPO_NAME/synthetics-minion Copy helm show values YOUR_REPO_NAME/synthetics-minion Copy Show license information To show the licensing information for the open source software that we use in the CPM, run the LICENSE command. Run this command to view license information for CPM versions 2.2.27 or higher: docker run quay.io/newrelic/synthetics-minion:latest LICENSE Copy Some of our open-source software is listed under multiple software licenses, and in that case we have listed the license we've chosen to use. Our license information is also available in the our licenses documentation. Configure CPM You can configure the containerized private minion with custom npm modules, preserve data between launches, use environment variables, and more. For more information, see CPM configuration. Networks For both Docker and Kubernetes, the CPM and its runner containers will inherit network settings from the host. For an example of this on a Docker container system environment, see the Docker site. A new bridge network is created for each runner container. This means networking command options like --network and --dns passed to the CPM container at launch (such as through Docker run commands on a Docker container system environment) are not inherited or used by the runner containers. When these networks are created, they pull from the default IP address pool configured for daemon. For an example of this on a Docker container system environment, see the Docker site. Typically, the runner network is removed after the check is completed. However, if a CPM exits while a check is still running, or exits in another unexpected circumstance, these networks may get orphaned. This can potentially use up IP address space that is available to the Docker daemon. If this happens, you may see INTERNAL ENGINE ERROR code: 31 entries in your CPM logging when trying to create a new runner container. To clean these up in Docker container system environments only, run docker network prune. Security, sandboxing, and running as non-root By default, the software running inside a CPM is executed with root user privileges. This is suitable for most scenarios, as the execution is sandboxed. In a Docker container system environment: To change the default AppArmor profile used by containers that CPM spawns to run monitors, see the environment variable MINION_RUNNER_APPARMOR (CPM version 3.0.3 or higher) or MINION_DOCKER_RUNNER_APPARMOR (CPM version up to v3.0.2). To run the CPM as a non-root user, additional steps are required: Run as non-root user for Docker For more information, see Docker's official documentation about security and AppArmor security profiles. If your environment requires you to run the CPM as a non-root user, follow this procedure. In the following example, the non-root user is my_user. Ensure that my_user can use the Docker engine on the host: Verify that my_user belongs to the \"docker\" system group. OR Enable the Docker TCP socket option, and pass the DOCKER_HOST environment variable to CPM. Verify that my_user has read/write permissions to all the directories and volumes passed to CPM. To set these permission, use the chmod command. Get the uid of my_user for use in the run command: id -u my_user. Once these conditions are met, use the option \"-u <uid>:<gid>\" when launching CPM: docker run ... -u 1002 ... Copy OR docker run ... -u 1002 -e DOCKER_HOST=http://localhost:2375 ... Copy Docker image repository A single CPM Docker image serves both the Docker container system environment and Kubernetes container orchestration system environment. The Docker image is hosted on quay.io. To make sure your Docker image is up-to-date, see the quay.io newrelic/synthetics-minion repository. Additional considerations for CPM connection Connection Description CPMs without Internet access A CPM can operate without access to the internet, but with some exceptions. The public internet health check can be disabled using the environment variables named MINION_NETWORK_HEALTHCHECK_DISABLED for a Docker container system environment or synthetics.minionNetworkHealthCheckDisabled for a Kubernetes container orchestration system environment. The CPM needs to be able to contact the \"synthetics-horde.nr-data.net\" domain. This is necessary for it to report data to New Relic and to receive monitors to execute. Ask your network administration if this is a problem and how to set up exceptions. Communicate with Synthetics via a proxy To set up communication with New Relic by proxy, use the environment variables named MINION_API_PROXY*. Arguments passed at launch This applies to a Docker container environment only. Arguments passed to the CPM container at launch do not get passed on to the containers spawned by the CPM. Docker has no concept of \"inheritance\" or a \"hierarchy\" of containers, and we don't copy the configuration that is passed from CPM to the monitor-running containers. The only shared configuration between them is the one set at the Docker daemon level.",

      "body": "Synthetic monitors are API checks or virtual browser instances that monitor your website, recording each check in detail. They can also: Capture aggregate numbers, including an overview or summary for ping monitors. Provide detailed statistics for each page resource, and downtime incidents. Collect custom response codes for more detail on your monitor runs. You'll be able to add and configure synthetic monitors to suit your environnment after you create a New Relic account. (It's free, forever!) Add a monitor You can add several types of synthetic monitors: Ping monitors ensure your website is responding, while simple browser monitors send real browsers to check your website. For more complex monitoring, scripted browser monitors verify that specific resources are present, while API tests verify your API endpoint. The default timeout for a new monitor is 180 seconds. To learn how to use our step monitor to build complex workflow validation scripts without writing any code, watch this short YouTube video (approx. 3:20 minutes). Add a ping or simple browser monitor Go to one.newrelic.com > Synthetics > Create monitor. Specify a monitor type, name, and URL (may be any valid HTTP or HTTPS URL). Optional: Add a validation string or Advanced options: A validation string is available for ping and simple browser. This option enables substring monitoring for response validation. Verify SSL is available for ping and simple browser. This option verifies the validity of the SSL certificate chain. It can be duplicated by running the following syntax: openssl s_client -servername {YOUR_HOSTNAME} -connect {YOUR_HOSTNAME}:443 -CApath /etc/ssl/certs -verify_hostname {YOUR_HOSTNAME} > /dev/null Copy If a non-zero exit code is returned, the monitor will fail. The Bypass HEAD request option is available for ping. This option skips the default HEAD request and instead uses the GET verb with a ping check. Redirect is Failure is available for ping. If a redirect result occurs when Redirect is Failure is enabled, New Relic Synthetics will categorize the result as a failure, rather than following the redirect and checking the resulting URL. Select the locations from which you want your monitor to run. Choose a frequency to determine how often each location will run your monitor. Optional: Set up alert notifications. Select Create my monitor to confirm. Generate some traffic and wait a few minutes, then check your monitor from the Monitors index. Add a scripted browser or API test monitor Go to one.newrelic.com > Synthetics > Create monitor. Specify a monitor type and name. Select the locations from which you want your monitor to run. Choose a frequency to determine how often each location will run your monitor. Optional: Set up alert notifications. Select Next: Write your script to create a script for your scripted browser or API test, then select Validate to verify your syntax. Tip For complex scripts, validation may take up to one minute. Select Create my monitor to confirm. Generate some traffic and wait a few minutes, then check your monitor from the Monitors index. Add a step monitor Go to one.newrelic.com > Synthetics > Create monitor. Select step monitor as the monitor type. Specify a name and choose a frequency to determine how often each location will run your monitor. Select the locations from which you want your monitor to run. Build your monitor by selecting from the preconfigured steps at the bottom of the UI: Navigate to a URL Type text Click an element Assert text Assert an element Secure a credential Use the instructions on the right side of the UI to help locate elements by CSS class, HTML ID, link text, or XPath. Select Save monitor to confirm. Generate some traffic and wait a few minutes, then check your monitor from the Monitors index. Add a certificate check monitor Go to one.newrelic.com > Synthetics > Create monitor. Select the certificate check monitor type. Specify a name and enter the domain you'd like to monitor. Enter the number of days it takes for your certificate to expire. Select the period to determine your monitor's frequency. Optional: Add tags to help you find this monitor later. Select the locations from which you want your monitor to run, and then click Save monitor to confirm. Generate some traffic and wait a few minutes, then check your monitor from the Monitors index. Add a broken links monitor Go to one.newrelic.com > Synthetics > Create monitor. Select the broken links check monitor type. Specify a name and enter the URL you'd like to monitor (may be any valid HTTP or HTTPS URL). Select the period to determine your monitor's frequency. Optional: Add tags to help you find this monitor later. Select the locations from which you want your monitor to run, and then click Save monitor to confirm. Generate some traffic and wait a few minutes, then check your monitor from the Monitors index. Tip You can also add monitors with the Synthetics REST API. For example, you can create a GET request to the monitor you want to use as the source for configuration, then use those key values to use in a POST to \"copy\" and create a new monitor. Edit a monitor You cannot change a monitor's type after the monitor is created, but you can edit other monitor settings. From the Monitors tab in one.newrelic.com > Synthetics, select the monitor you want to edit. In the side menu, select a link to change the following settings: Select Settings > General to edit name, Apdex T, URL, locations, frequency, and advanced options. For Scripted browser and API test monitors, select Settings > Script to edit your monitor script. For synthetic monitoring alerts, click Manage alerts. Select Save changes to confirm. Delete a monitor You must have Admin privileges in order to delete a monitor. To delete a monitor: From the Monitors tab in one.newrelic.com > Synthetics, select the monitor you want to edit. From the selected monitor, select Settings > General. Scroll to the bottom of the page and select the trash can icon. Tip You can also delete a monitor with the Synthetics REST API. Monitor settings When configuring monitors, the following settings are available: Type Select the type of monitor you want to create. A monitor's type can't be changed after the monitor is created. Ping: Specify a single URL to monitor for availability. New Relic will check this URL via HEAD or GET requests. The non-configurable timeout for this monitor is 60 seconds. Simple browser: Specify a single URL to monitor via real browser. Once each frequency interval, New Relic will check this URL via a Selenium-powered Google Chrome browser. The non-configurable timeout for this monitor is 60 seconds. Scripted browser: Create a script to drive a Selenium-powered Google Chrome browser. The browser follows each step in the script to verify that complex behavior is working as expected (for example, searching a website, then clicking one of the search results). The non-configurable timeout for this monitor is 180 seconds. API test: Create an API script to ensure your API endpoint is working correctly. For more information, see Write API tests. The non-configurable timeout for this monitor is 180 seconds. Monitor name Defines a name for the monitor. Monitor names cannot contain unencoded angle brackets (< >). To include angle brackets in a monitor name, encode them as HTML bracket entities (&lt; &gt;) in the UI or API. Location Select the locations where you want your monitor to run. Select more locations to ensure that your application is available to users around the world. If you have any private locations, they will be listed here too. You can use the Synthetics API location endpoint to retrieve a list of valid locations for your account. Your monitor will run one check from each selected location during each frequency interval. For example, if you select three locations and define a frequency of 15 minutes, your monitor will run three checks in each 15 minute period (or 8,640 checks per month). Frequency Select how often the monitor runs, in increments of minutes, hours, or 1 day. This frequency applies to each location. For example, if you select three locations and a Frequency of 15 minutes, your monitor will run three checks, on average every 5 minutes, in each 15 minute period (or 8,640 checks per month). Alerts Specify an email address to receive alerts when a monitor fails. Or, attach a monitor to an existing alert policy for more notification options. For more information, see Alerting for synthetic monitoring. Apdex T Customize the Apdex T for this monitor. This setting is only available when editing the settings for an existing monitor, not when creating a new monitor. Change the Apdex T from the default 7 seconds for more accurate Apdex scores in your SLA reports. For example, if you have a very long scripted browser, you might adjust the Apdex T to 15 seconds to more closely reflect the usual completion time. Similarly, a good Apdex T for a simple browser check might be only 2 seconds. Response Validation (optional) Specify text to search for on the page. When using simple browser or ping monitor types, there is a 1MB (10^6 bytes) limit on the page load. See a history of monitor changes You can use New Relic One to see a history of recent changes to synthetic monitors and what users changed them.",

      "body": "You can use New Relic's containerized private minions (CPM). These are Docker container-based private minions that accept and execute synthetic monitors against your private locations. The CPM can operate in a Docker container system environment or a Kubernetes container orchestration system environment. The CPM will auto-detect its environment to select the appropriate operating mode. General private minion features Because the CPM operates as a container instead of a virtual machine, it delivers many features: Easy to install, start, and update Runs on: Linux macOS Windows Enhanced security and support for non-root user execution Ability to leverage a Docker container as a sandbox environment Customizable monitor check timeout Custom provided modules for scripted monitor types Kubernetes-specific features Also, the CPM delivers the following features in a Kubernetes environment: Integrates with the Kubernetes API to delegate runtime lifecycle management to Kubernetes Does not require privileged access to the Docker socket Supports hosted and on-premise Kubernetes clusters Supports various container engines such as Docker and Containerd Deployable via Helm charts as well as configuration YAMLs Allows job (ping vs. non-ping checks) based resource allocation for optimum resource management Observability offered via the New Relic One Kubernetes cluster explorer System requirements and compatibility To host CPMs, your system must meet the minimum requirements for the chosen system environment. Caution Do not modify any CPM files. New Relic is not liable for any modifications you make. For more information, contact your account representative or a New Relic technical sales rep. Docker container system environment requirements Compatibility for Requirements Operating system Linux kernel: 3.10 or higher. macOS: 10.11 or higher. Windows: Windows 10 64-bit or higher. You must also configure Docker to run Linux containers in order for CPMs to work on Windows systems. Processor A modern, multi-core CPU Memory 2.5 GiB of RAM per CPU core (dedicated) Disk space A minimum of 10 GB per host Docker version Docker 17.12.1-ce or higher Private location key You must have a private location key Caution The Docker CPM is not designed for use with container orchestrators like AWS ECS, Docker Swarm, Apache Mesos, Azure Container Instances, etc. Running the Docker CPM in a container orchestrator will result in unexpected issues because it is itself a container orchestrator. If you're using container orchestration, see our Kubernetes CPM requirements. Kubernetes container orchestration system environment requirements (CPM v3.0.0 or higher) Compatibility for Requirements Operating system Linux kernel: 3.10 or higher macOS: 10.11 or higher Windows: Windows 10 64-bit or higher Processor A modern, multi-core CPU Minion pod CPU (vCPU/Core): 0.5 up to 0.75 Memory: 800 Mi up to 1.6 Gi Resources allocated to a Minion pod are user configurable. Runner pod CPU (vCPU/Core): 0.5 up to 1 Memory: 1.25 Gi up to 3 Gi For a scripted API check, 1.25 Gi will be requested with a limit of 2.5 Gi. For a simple browser or scripted browser check, 2 Gi will be requested with a limit of 3 Gi. Additional considerations: Resources allocated to a runner pod are not user configurable. The maximum limit-request resource ratio for both CPU and memory is 2. Disk space Persistent volume (PV) of at least 10 Gi in size Note that if a ReadWriteOnce (RWO) PV is provided to the minion, an implicit node affinity will be established to ensure the minion and the runner containers are scheduled on the same node. This is required to allow the minion and the associated runners access to the PV, as an RWO PV can be accessed only by a single node in the cluster. Kubernetes version We recommend that your Kubernetes cluster supports Kubernetes v1.15. Caution We have identified a compatibility issue with Kubernetes v1.21+. A workaround is available by disabling the BoundServiceAccountTokenVolume feature gate on the cluster. Private location key You must have a private location key Helm Follow installation instructions for Helm v3 for your OS. Kubectl Follow installation instructions for Kubectl for your OS. To view versions, dependencies, default values for how many runner pods start with each minion, the Persistent volume access mode, and more, please see Show help and examples below. Private location key Before launching CPMs, you must have a private location key. Your CPM uses the key to authenticate against New Relic and run monitors associated with that private location. To find the key for existing private location: Go to one.newrelic.com > Synthetics > Private locations. In the Private locations index, locate the private location you want your CPM to be assigned to. Note the key associated with the private location with the key icon. Sandboxing and Docker dependencies Sandboxing and Docker dependencies are applicable to the CPM in a Docker container system environment. Docker dependencies The CPM runs in Docker and is able to leverage Docker as a sandboxing technology. This ensures complete isolation of the monitor execution, which improves security, reliability, and repeatability. Every time a scripted or browser monitor is executed, the CPM creates a brand new Docker container to run it in called a runner. The minion container needs to be configured to communicate with the Docker engine in order to spawn additional runner containers. Each spawned container is then dedicated to run a check associated with the synthetic monitor running on the private location the minion container is associated with. There are two crucial dependencies at launch. To enable sandboxing, ensure that: Your writable and executable directory is mounted at /tmp. The writable directory can be any directory you want the CPM to write into, but New Relic recommends the system's own /tmp to make things easy. Your writable Docker UNIX socket is mounted at /var/run/docker.sock or DOCKER_HOST environment variable. For more information, see Docker's Daemon socket option. Caution Core count on the host determines how many runner containers the CPM can run concurrently on the host. Since memory requirements are scaled to the expected count of runner containers, we recommend not running multiple CPMs on the same host to avoid resource contention. For additional information on sandboxing and running as a root or non-root user, see Security, sandboxing, and running as non-root. Install and update CPM versions Both installing and updating the CPM use the same command to pull the latest Docker image from the Quay.io repository where the CPM Docker image is hosted. Go to quay.io/repository/newrelic/synthetics-minion for a list of all the releases. CPM images are also hosted on Docker Hub. Go to hub.docker.com/r/newrelic/synthetics-minion/tags for a list of all the releases. Unless hosting the images in a local image repository, connections to either quay.io or docker.io will need to be allowed through your firewall in order for Docker to pull the synthetics-minion and synthetics-minion-runner images. The \"runner\" image is pulled automatically on startup of the synthetics-minion container. See Docker environment configuration and Kubernetes environment configuration for details on how to set a local repository and the runner registry endpoint. Start the CPM To start the CPM, follow the applicable Docker or Kubernetes instructions. Docker start procedure Locate your private location key. Ensure you've enabled Docker dependencies for sandboxing and installed CPM on your system. Run the appropriate script for your system. Tailor the common defaults for /tmp and /var/run/docker.sock in the following examples to match your system. Linux/macOS: docker run \\ --name YOUR_CONTAINER_NAME \\ -e \"MINION_PRIVATE_LOCATION_KEY=YOUR_PRIVATE_LOCATION_KEY\" \\ -v /tmp:/tmp:rw \\ -v /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock:rw \\ -d \\ --restart unless-stopped \\ quay.io/newrelic/synthetics-minion:latest Copy Windows: docker run ^ --name YOUR_CONTAINER_NAME ^ -e \"MINION_PRIVATE_LOCATION_KEY=YOUR_PRIVATE_LOCATION_KEY\" ^ -v /tmp:/tmp:rw ^ -v /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock:rw ^ -d ^ --restart unless-stopped ^ quay.io/newrelic/synthetics-minion:latest Copy View the logs for your minion container: docker logs --follow YOUR_CONTAINER_NAME Copy When a message similar to Synthetics Minion is ready and servicing location YOUR_PRIVATE_LOCATION_LABEL appears, your CPM is up and ready to run monitors assigned to that location. Kubernetes start procedure Locate your private location key. Set up the a namespace for the CPM in your Kubernetes cluster: kubectl create namespace YOUR_NAMESPACE Copy Copy the Helm charts from the New Relic Helm repo. If you are copying the charts for the first time: helm repo add YOUR_REPO_NAME https://helm-charts.newrelic.com/charts Copy If you previously copied the Helm charts from the New Relic Helm repo, then get the latest: helm repo update Copy Install the CPM with the following Helm command: For a fresh installation of the CPM: helm install YOUR_CPM_NAME YOUR_REPO_NAME/synthetics-minion -n YOUR_NAMESPACE --set synthetics.privateLocationKey=YOUR_PRIVATE_LOCATION_KEY Copy To update an existing CPM installation: helm upgrade YOUR_CPM_NAME YOUR_REPO_NAME/synthetics-minion -n YOUR_NAMESPACE --set synthetics.privateLocationKey=YOUR_PRIVATE_LOCATION_KEY Copy Check if the minion pod is up and running: kubectl get -n YOUR_NAMESPACE pods Copy Once the status attribute of each pod is shown as running, your CPM is up and ready to run monitors assigned to your private location. Stop or delete the CPM On a Docker container system environment, use the Docker stop procedure to stop the CPM from running. On a Kubernetes container orchestration system environment, use the Kubernetes delete procedure to stop the CPM from running. Docker stop procedure You can stop a Docker container either by the container name, or the container ID. Container name stop for Linux, macOS, and Windows: docker stop YOUR_CONTAINER_NAME docker rm YOUR_CONTAINER_NAME Copy Container ID stop for Linux/macOS: In the examples the container is stopped and removed. To only stop the container, omit docker rm $CONTAINER_ID. CONTAINER_ID=$(docker ps -aqf name=YOUR_CONTAINER_NAME) docker stop $CONTAINER_ID docker rm $CONTAINER_ID Copy Container ID stop for Windows: In the examples the container is stopped and removed. To only stop the container, omit docker rm $CONTAINER_ID. FOR /F \"tokens=*\" %%CID IN ('docker ps -aqf name=YOUR_CONTAINER_NAME') do (SET CONTAINER_ID=%%CID) docker stop %CONTAINER_ID% docker rm %CONTAINER_ID% Copy Kubernetes delete procedure Get the MINION_POD_INSTALLATION_NAME of the minion pod you want to delete: helm list -n YOUR_NAMESPACE Copy Delete the minion pod: helm uninstall -n YOUR_NAMESPACE MINION_POD_INSTALLATION_NAME Copy Delete the namespace set up for the CPM in your Kubernetes cluster: kubectl delete namespace YOUR_NAMESPACE Copy Show help and examples Use these options as applicable: To get a list of the most commonly used run options directly in the command line interface, run the show help command. To show CPM usage examples as well as the list of all the available run options, run this command: docker run quay.io/newrelic/synthetics-minion:latest help Copy To keep track of Docker logs and verify the health of your monitors, see Containerized private minion (CPM) maintenance and monitoring. For a CPM in the Kubernetes container orchestration system environment, the following Helm show commands can be used to view the chart.yaml and the values.yaml, respectively: helm show chart YOUR_REPO_NAME/synthetics-minion Copy helm show values YOUR_REPO_NAME/synthetics-minion Copy Show license information To show the licensing information for the open source software that we use in the CPM, run the LICENSE command. Run this command to view license information for CPM versions 2.2.27 or higher: docker run quay.io/newrelic/synthetics-minion:latest LICENSE Copy Some of our open-source software is listed under multiple software licenses, and in that case we have listed the license we've chosen to use. Our license information is also available in the our licenses documentation. Configure CPM You can configure the containerized private minion with custom npm modules, preserve data between launches, use environment variables, and more. For more information, see CPM configuration. Networks For both Docker and Kubernetes, the CPM and its runner containers will inherit network settings from the host. For an example of this on a Docker container system environment, see the Docker site. A new bridge network is created for each runner container. This means networking command options like --network and --dns passed to the CPM container at launch (such as through Docker run commands on a Docker container system environment) are not inherited or used by the runner containers. When these networks are created, they pull from the default IP address pool configured for daemon. For an example of this on a Docker container system environment, see the Docker site. Typically, the runner network is removed after the check is completed. However, if a CPM exits while a check is still running, or exits in another unexpected circumstance, these networks may get orphaned. This can potentially use up IP address space that is available to the Docker daemon. If this happens, you may see INTERNAL ENGINE ERROR code: 31 entries in your CPM logging when trying to create a new runner container. To clean these up in Docker container system environments only, run docker network prune. Security, sandboxing, and running as non-root By default, the software running inside a CPM is executed with root user privileges. This is suitable for most scenarios, as the execution is sandboxed. In a Docker container system environment: To change the default AppArmor profile used by containers that CPM spawns to run monitors, see the environment variable MINION_RUNNER_APPARMOR (CPM version 3.0.3 or higher) or MINION_DOCKER_RUNNER_APPARMOR (CPM version up to v3.0.2). To run the CPM as a non-root user, additional steps are required: Run as non-root user for Docker For more information, see Docker's official documentation about security and AppArmor security profiles. If your environment requires you to run the CPM as a non-root user, follow this procedure. In the following example, the non-root user is my_user. Ensure that my_user can use the Docker engine on the host: Verify that my_user belongs to the \"docker\" system group. OR Enable the Docker TCP socket option, and pass the DOCKER_HOST environment variable to CPM. Verify that my_user has read/write permissions to all the directories and volumes passed to CPM. To set these permission, use the chmod command. Get the uid of my_user for use in the run command: id -u my_user. Once these conditions are met, use the option \"-u <uid>:<gid>\" when launching CPM: docker run ... -u 1002 ... Copy OR docker run ... -u 1002 -e DOCKER_HOST=http://localhost:2375 ... Copy Docker image repository A single CPM Docker image serves both the Docker container system environment and Kubernetes container orchestration system environment. The Docker image is hosted on quay.io. To make sure your Docker image is up-to-date, see the quay.io newrelic/synthetics-minion repository. Additional considerations for CPM connection Connection Description CPMs without Internet access A CPM can operate without access to the internet, but with some exceptions. The public internet health check can be disabled using the environment variables named MINION_NETWORK_HEALTHCHECK_DISABLED for a Docker container system environment or synthetics.minionNetworkHealthCheckDisabled for a Kubernetes container orchestration system environment. The CPM needs to be able to contact the \"synthetics-horde.nr-data.net\" domain. This is necessary for it to report data to New Relic and to receive monitors to execute. Ask your network administration if this is a problem and how to set up exceptions. Communicate with Synthetics via a proxy To set up communication with New Relic by proxy, use the environment variables named MINION_API_PROXY*. Arguments passed at launch This applies to a Docker container environment only. Arguments passed to the CPM container at launch do not get passed on to the containers spawned by the CPM. Docker has no concept of \"inheritance\" or a \"hierarchy\" of containers, and we don't copy the configuration that is passed from CPM to the monitor-running containers. The only shared configuration between them is the one set at the Docker daemon level.",

      "body": "Synthetic monitors are API checks or virtual browser instances that monitor your website, recording each check in detail. They can also: Capture aggregate numbers, including an overview or summary for ping monitors. Provide detailed statistics for each page resource, and downtime incidents. Collect custom response codes for more detail on your monitor runs. You'll be able to add and configure synthetic monitors to suit your environnment after you create a New Relic account. (It's free, forever!) Add a monitor You can add several types of synthetic monitors: Ping monitors ensure your website is responding, while simple browser monitors send real browsers to check your website. For more complex monitoring, scripted browser monitors verify that specific resources are present, while API tests verify your API endpoint. The default timeout for a new monitor is 180 seconds. To learn how to use our step monitor to build complex workflow validation scripts without writing any code, watch this short YouTube video (approx. 3:20 minutes). Add a ping or simple browser monitor Go to one.newrelic.com > Synthetics > Create monitor. Specify a monitor type, name, and URL (may be any valid HTTP or HTTPS URL). Optional: Add a validation string or Advanced options: A validation string is available for ping and simple browser. This option enables substring monitoring for response validation. Verify SSL is available for ping and simple browser. This option verifies the validity of the SSL certificate chain. It can be duplicated by running the following syntax: openssl s_client -servername {YOUR_HOSTNAME} -connect {YOUR_HOSTNAME}:443 -CApath /etc/ssl/certs -verify_hostname {YOUR_HOSTNAME} > /dev/null Copy If a non-zero exit code is returned, the monitor will fail. The Bypass HEAD request option is available for ping. This option skips the default HEAD request and instead uses the GET verb with a ping check. Redirect is Failure is available for ping. If a redirect result occurs when Redirect is Failure is enabled, New Relic Synthetics will categorize the result as a failure, rather than following the redirect and checking the resulting URL. Select the locations from which you want your monitor to run. Choose a frequency to determine how often each location will run your monitor. Optional: Set up alert notifications. Select Create my monitor to confirm. Generate some traffic and wait a few minutes, then check your monitor from the Monitors index. Add a scripted browser or API test monitor Go to one.newrelic.com > Synthetics > Create monitor. Specify a monitor type and name. Select the locations from which you want your monitor to run. Choose a frequency to determine how often each location will run your monitor. Optional: Set up alert notifications. Select Next: Write your script to create a script for your scripted browser or API test, then select Validate to verify your syntax. Tip For complex scripts, validation may take up to one minute. Select Create my monitor to confirm. Generate some traffic and wait a few minutes, then check your monitor from the Monitors index. Add a step monitor Go to one.newrelic.com > Synthetics > Create monitor. Select step monitor as the monitor type. Specify a name and choose a frequency to determine how often each location will run your monitor. Select the locations from which you want your monitor to run. Build your monitor by selecting from the preconfigured steps at the bottom of the UI: Navigate to a URL Type text Click an element Assert text Assert an element Secure a credential Use the instructions on the right side of the UI to help locate elements by CSS class, HTML ID, link text, or XPath. Select Save monitor to confirm. Generate some traffic and wait a few minutes, then check your monitor from the Monitors index. Add a certificate check monitor Go to one.newrelic.com > Synthetics > Create monitor. Select the certificate check monitor type. Specify a name and enter the domain you'd like to monitor. Enter the number of days it takes for your certificate to expire. Select the period to determine your monitor's frequency. Optional: Add tags to help you find this monitor later. Select the locations from which you want your monitor to run, and then click Save monitor to confirm. Generate some traffic and wait a few minutes, then check your monitor from the Monitors index. Add a broken links monitor Go to one.newrelic.com > Synthetics > Create monitor. Select the broken links check monitor type. Specify a name and enter the URL you'd like to monitor (may be any valid HTTP or HTTPS URL). Select the period to determine your monitor's frequency. Optional: Add tags to help you find this monitor later. Select the locations from which you want your monitor to run, and then click Save monitor to confirm. Generate some traffic and wait a few minutes, then check your monitor from the Monitors index. Tip You can also add monitors with the Synthetics REST API. For example, you can create a GET request to the monitor you want to use as the source for configuration, then use those key values to use in a POST to \"copy\" and create a new monitor. Edit a monitor You cannot change a monitor's type after the monitor is created, but you can edit other monitor settings. From the Monitors tab in one.newrelic.com > Synthetics, select the monitor you want to edit. In the side menu, select a link to change the following settings: Select Settings > General to edit name, Apdex T, URL, locations, frequency, and advanced options. For Scripted browser and API test monitors, select Settings > Script to edit your monitor script. For synthetic monitoring alerts, click Manage alerts. Select Save changes to confirm. Delete a monitor You must have Admin privileges in order to delete a monitor. To delete a monitor: From the Monitors tab in one.newrelic.com > Synthetics, select the monitor you want to edit. From the selected monitor, select Settings > General. Scroll to the bottom of the page and select the trash can icon. Tip You can also delete a monitor with the Synthetics REST API. Monitor settings When configuring monitors, the following settings are available: Type Select the type of monitor you want to create. A monitor's type can't be changed after the monitor is created. Ping: Specify a single URL to monitor for availability. New Relic will check this URL via HEAD or GET requests. The non-configurable timeout for this monitor is 60 seconds. Simple browser: Specify a single URL to monitor via real browser. Once each frequency interval, New Relic will check this URL via a Selenium-powered Google Chrome browser. The non-configurable timeout for this monitor is 60 seconds. Scripted browser: Create a script to drive a Selenium-powered Google Chrome browser. The browser follows each step in the script to verify that complex behavior is working as expected (for example, searching a website, then clicking one of the search results). The non-configurable timeout for this monitor is 180 seconds. API test: Create an API script to ensure your API endpoint is working correctly. For more information, see Write API tests. The non-configurable timeout for this monitor is 180 seconds. Monitor name Defines a name for the monitor. Monitor names cannot contain unencoded angle brackets (< >). To include angle brackets in a monitor name, encode them as HTML bracket entities (&lt; &gt;) in the UI or API. Location Select the locations where you want your monitor to run. Select more locations to ensure that your application is available to users around the world. If you have any private locations, they will be listed here too. You can use the Synthetics API location endpoint to retrieve a list of valid locations for your account. Your monitor will run one check from each selected location during each frequency interval. For example, if you select three locations and define a frequency of 15 minutes, your monitor will run three checks in each 15 minute period (or 8,640 checks per month). Frequency Select how often the monitor runs, in increments of minutes, hours, or 1 day. This frequency applies to each location. For example, if you select three locations and a Frequency of 15 minutes, your monitor will run three checks, on average every 5 minutes, in each 15 minute period (or 8,640 checks per month). Alerts Specify an email address to receive alerts when a monitor fails. Or, attach a monitor to an existing alert policy for more notification options. For more information, see Alerting for synthetic monitoring. Apdex T Customize the Apdex T for this monitor. This setting is only available when editing the settings for an existing monitor, not when creating a new monitor. Change the Apdex T from the default 7 seconds for more accurate Apdex scores in your SLA reports. For example, if you have a very long scripted browser, you might adjust the Apdex T to 15 seconds to more closely reflect the usual completion time. Similarly, a good Apdex T for a simple browser check might be only 2 seconds. Response Validation (optional) Specify text to search for on the page. When using simple browser or ping monitor types, there is a 1MB (10^6 bytes) limit on the page load. See a history of monitor changes You can use New Relic One to see a history of recent changes to synthetic monitors and what users changed them.",

      "body": "You can use New Relic's containerized private minions (CPM). These are Docker container-based private minions that accept and execute synthetic monitors against your private locations. The CPM can operate in a Docker container system environment or a Kubernetes container orchestration system environment. The CPM will auto-detect its environment to select the appropriate operating mode. General private minion features Because the CPM operates as a container instead of a virtual machine, it delivers many features: Easy to install, start, and update Runs on: Linux macOS Windows Enhanced security and support for non-root user execution Ability to leverage a Docker container as a sandbox environment Customizable monitor check timeout Custom provided modules for scripted monitor types Kubernetes-specific features Also, the CPM delivers the following features in a Kubernetes environment: Integrates with the Kubernetes API to delegate runtime lifecycle management to Kubernetes Does not require privileged access to the Docker socket Supports hosted and on-premise Kubernetes clusters Supports various container engines such as Docker and Containerd Deployable via Helm charts as well as configuration YAMLs Allows job (ping vs. non-ping checks) based resource allocation for optimum resource management Observability offered via the New Relic One Kubernetes cluster explorer System requirements and compatibility To host CPMs, your system must meet the minimum requirements for the chosen system environment. Caution Do not modify any CPM files. New Relic is not liable for any modifications you make. For more information, contact your account representative or a New Relic technical sales rep. Docker container system environment requirements Compatibility for Requirements Operating system Linux kernel: 3.10 or higher. macOS: 10.11 or higher. Windows: Windows 10 64-bit or higher. You must also configure Docker to run Linux containers in order for CPMs to work on Windows systems. Processor A modern, multi-core CPU Memory 2.5 GiB of RAM per CPU core (dedicated) Disk space A minimum of 10 GB per host Docker version Docker 17.12.1-ce or higher Private location key You must have a private location key Caution The Docker CPM is not designed for use with container orchestrators like AWS ECS, Docker Swarm, Apache Mesos, Azure Container Instances, etc. Running the Docker CPM in a container orchestrator will result in unexpected issues because it is itself a container orchestrator. If you're using container orchestration, see our Kubernetes CPM requirements. Kubernetes container orchestration system environment requirements (CPM v3.0.0 or higher) Compatibility for Requirements Operating system Linux kernel: 3.10 or higher macOS: 10.11 or higher Windows: Windows 10 64-bit or higher Processor A modern, multi-core CPU Minion pod CPU (vCPU/Core): 0.5 up to 0.75 Memory: 800 Mi up to 1.6 Gi Resources allocated to a Minion pod are user configurable. Runner pod CPU (vCPU/Core): 0.5 up to 1 Memory: 1.25 Gi up to 3 Gi For a scripted API check, 1.25 Gi will be requested with a limit of 2.5 Gi. For a simple browser or scripted browser check, 2 Gi will be requested with a limit of 3 Gi. Additional considerations: Resources allocated to a runner pod are not user configurable. The maximum limit-request resource ratio for both CPU and memory is 2. Disk space Persistent volume (PV) of at least 10 Gi in size Note that if a ReadWriteOnce (RWO) PV is provided to the minion, an implicit node affinity will be established to ensure the minion and the runner containers are scheduled on the same node. This is required to allow the minion and the associated runners access to the PV, as an RWO PV can be accessed only by a single node in the cluster. Kubernetes version We recommend that your Kubernetes cluster supports Kubernetes v1.15. Caution We have identified a compatibility issue with Kubernetes v1.21+. A workaround is available by disabling the BoundServiceAccountTokenVolume feature gate on the cluster. Private location key You must have a private location key Helm Follow installation instructions for Helm v3 for your OS. Kubectl Follow installation instructions for Kubectl for your OS. To view versions, dependencies, default values for how many runner pods start with each minion, the Persistent volume access mode, and more, please see Show help and examples below. Private location key Before launching CPMs, you must have a private location key. Your CPM uses the key to authenticate against New Relic and run monitors associated with that private location. To find the key for existing private location: Go to one.newrelic.com > Synthetics > Private locations. In the Private locations index, locate the private location you want your CPM to be assigned to. Note the key associated with the private location with the key icon. Sandboxing and Docker dependencies Sandboxing and Docker dependencies are applicable to the CPM in a Docker container system environment. Docker dependencies The CPM runs in Docker and is able to leverage Docker as a sandboxing technology. This ensures complete isolation of the monitor execution, which improves security, reliability, and repeatability. Every time a scripted or browser monitor is executed, the CPM creates a brand new Docker container to run it in called a runner. The minion container needs to be configured to communicate with the Docker engine in order to spawn additional runner containers. Each spawned container is then dedicated to run a check associated with the synthetic monitor running on the private location the minion container is associated with. There are two crucial dependencies at launch. To enable sandboxing, ensure that: Your writable and executable directory is mounted at /tmp. The writable directory can be any directory you want the CPM to write into, but New Relic recommends the system's own /tmp to make things easy. Your writable Docker UNIX socket is mounted at /var/run/docker.sock or DOCKER_HOST environment variable. For more information, see Docker's Daemon socket option. Caution Core count on the host determines how many runner containers the CPM can run concurrently on the host. Since memory requirements are scaled to the expected count of runner containers, we recommend not running multiple CPMs on the same host to avoid resource contention. For additional information on sandboxing and running as a root or non-root user, see Security, sandboxing, and running as non-root. Install and update CPM versions Both installing and updating the CPM use the same command to pull the latest Docker image from the Quay.io repository where the CPM Docker image is hosted. Go to quay.io/repository/newrelic/synthetics-minion for a list of all the releases. CPM images are also hosted on Docker Hub. Go to hub.docker.com/r/newrelic/synthetics-minion/tags for a list of all the releases. Unless hosting the images in a local image repository, connections to either quay.io or docker.io will need to be allowed through your firewall in order for Docker to pull the synthetics-minion and synthetics-minion-runner images. The \"runner\" image is pulled automatically on startup of the synthetics-minion container. See Docker environment configuration and Kubernetes environment configuration for details on how to set a local repository and the runner registry endpoint. Start the CPM To start the CPM, follow the applicable Docker or Kubernetes instructions. Docker start procedure Locate your private location key. Ensure you've enabled Docker dependencies for sandboxing and installed CPM on your system. Run the appropriate script for your system. Tailor the common defaults for /tmp and /var/run/docker.sock in the following examples to match your system. Linux/macOS: docker run \\ --name YOUR_CONTAINER_NAME \\ -e \"MINION_PRIVATE_LOCATION_KEY=YOUR_PRIVATE_LOCATION_KEY\" \\ -v /tmp:/tmp:rw \\ -v /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock:rw \\ -d \\ --restart unless-stopped \\ quay.io/newrelic/synthetics-minion:latest Copy Windows: docker run ^ --name YOUR_CONTAINER_NAME ^ -e \"MINION_PRIVATE_LOCATION_KEY=YOUR_PRIVATE_LOCATION_KEY\" ^ -v /tmp:/tmp:rw ^ -v /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock:rw ^ -d ^ --restart unless-stopped ^ quay.io/newrelic/synthetics-minion:latest Copy View the logs for your minion container: docker logs --follow YOUR_CONTAINER_NAME Copy When a message similar to Synthetics Minion is ready and servicing location YOUR_PRIVATE_LOCATION_LABEL appears, your CPM is up and ready to run monitors assigned to that location. Kubernetes start procedure Locate your private location key. Set up the a namespace for the CPM in your Kubernetes cluster: kubectl create namespace YOUR_NAMESPACE Copy Copy the Helm charts from the New Relic Helm repo. If you are copying the charts for the first time: helm repo add YOUR_REPO_NAME https://helm-charts.newrelic.com/charts Copy If you previously copied the Helm charts from the New Relic Helm repo, then get the latest: helm repo update Copy Install the CPM with the following Helm command: For a fresh installation of the CPM: helm install YOUR_CPM_NAME YOUR_REPO_NAME/synthetics-minion -n YOUR_NAMESPACE --set synthetics.privateLocationKey=YOUR_PRIVATE_LOCATION_KEY Copy To update an existing CPM installation: helm upgrade YOUR_CPM_NAME YOUR_REPO_NAME/synthetics-minion -n YOUR_NAMESPACE --set synthetics.privateLocationKey=YOUR_PRIVATE_LOCATION_KEY Copy Check if the minion pod is up and running: kubectl get -n YOUR_NAMESPACE pods Copy Once the status attribute of each pod is shown as running, your CPM is up and ready to run monitors assigned to your private location. Stop or delete the CPM On a Docker container system environment, use the Docker stop procedure to stop the CPM from running. On a Kubernetes container orchestration system environment, use the Kubernetes delete procedure to stop the CPM from running. Docker stop procedure You can stop a Docker container either by the container name, or the container ID. Container name stop for Linux, macOS, and Windows: docker stop YOUR_CONTAINER_NAME docker rm YOUR_CONTAINER_NAME Copy Container ID stop for Linux/macOS: In the examples the container is stopped and removed. To only stop the container, omit docker rm $CONTAINER_ID. CONTAINER_ID=$(docker ps -aqf name=YOUR_CONTAINER_NAME) docker stop $CONTAINER_ID docker rm $CONTAINER_ID Copy Container ID stop for Windows: In the examples the container is stopped and removed. To only stop the container, omit docker rm $CONTAINER_ID. FOR /F \"tokens=*\" %%CID IN ('docker ps -aqf name=YOUR_CONTAINER_NAME') do (SET CONTAINER_ID=%%CID) docker stop %CONTAINER_ID% docker rm %CONTAINER_ID% Copy Kubernetes delete procedure Get the MINION_POD_INSTALLATION_NAME of the minion pod you want to delete: helm list -n YOUR_NAMESPACE Copy Delete the minion pod: helm uninstall -n YOUR_NAMESPACE MINION_POD_INSTALLATION_NAME Copy Delete the namespace set up for the CPM in your Kubernetes cluster: kubectl delete namespace YOUR_NAMESPACE Copy Show help and examples Use these options as applicable: To get a list of the most commonly used run options directly in the command line interface, run the show help command. To show CPM usage examples as well as the list of all the available run options, run this command: docker run quay.io/newrelic/synthetics-minion:latest help Copy To keep track of Docker logs and verify the health of your monitors, see Containerized private minion (CPM) maintenance and monitoring. For a CPM in the Kubernetes container orchestration system environment, the following Helm show commands can be used to view the chart.yaml and the values.yaml, respectively: helm show chart YOUR_REPO_NAME/synthetics-minion Copy helm show values YOUR_REPO_NAME/synthetics-minion Copy Show license information To show the licensing information for the open source software that we use in the CPM, run the LICENSE command. Run this command to view license information for CPM versions 2.2.27 or higher: docker run quay.io/newrelic/synthetics-minion:latest LICENSE Copy Some of our open-source software is listed under multiple software licenses, and in that case we have listed the license we've chosen to use. Our license information is also available in the our licenses documentation. Configure CPM You can configure the containerized private minion with custom npm modules, preserve data between launches, use environment variables, and more. For more information, see CPM configuration. Networks For both Docker and Kubernetes, the CPM and its runner containers will inherit network settings from the host. For an example of this on a Docker container system environment, see the Docker site. A new bridge network is created for each runner container. This means networking command options like --network and --dns passed to the CPM container at launch (such as through Docker run commands on a Docker container system environment) are not inherited or used by the runner containers. When these networks are created, they pull from the default IP address pool configured for daemon. For an example of this on a Docker container system environment, see the Docker site. Typically, the runner network is removed after the check is completed. However, if a CPM exits while a check is still running, or exits in another unexpected circumstance, these networks may get orphaned. This can potentially use up IP address space that is available to the Docker daemon. If this happens, you may see INTERNAL ENGINE ERROR code: 31 entries in your CPM logging when trying to create a new runner container. To clean these up in Docker container system environments only, run docker network prune. Security, sandboxing, and running as non-root By default, the software running inside a CPM is executed with root user privileges. This is suitable for most scenarios, as the execution is sandboxed. In a Docker container system environment: To change the default AppArmor profile used by containers that CPM spawns to run monitors, see the environment variable MINION_RUNNER_APPARMOR (CPM version 3.0.3 or higher) or MINION_DOCKER_RUNNER_APPARMOR (CPM version up to v3.0.2). To run the CPM as a non-root user, additional steps are required: Run as non-root user for Docker For more information, see Docker's official documentation about security and AppArmor security profiles. If your environment requires you to run the CPM as a non-root user, follow this procedure. In the following example, the non-root user is my_user. Ensure that my_user can use the Docker engine on the host: Verify that my_user belongs to the \"docker\" system group. OR Enable the Docker TCP socket option, and pass the DOCKER_HOST environment variable to CPM. Verify that my_user has read/write permissions to all the directories and volumes passed to CPM. To set these permission, use the chmod command. Get the uid of my_user for use in the run command: id -u my_user. Once these conditions are met, use the option \"-u <uid>:<gid>\" when launching CPM: docker run ... -u 1002 ... Copy OR docker run ... -u 1002 -e DOCKER_HOST=http://localhost:2375 ... Copy Docker image repository A single CPM Docker image serves both the Docker container system environment and Kubernetes container orchestration system environment. The Docker image is hosted on quay.io. To make sure your Docker image is up-to-date, see the quay.io newrelic/synthetics-minion repository. Additional considerations for CPM connection Connection Description CPMs without Internet access A CPM can operate without access to the internet, but with some exceptions. The public internet health check can be disabled using the environment variables named MINION_NETWORK_HEALTHCHECK_DISABLED for a Docker container system environment or synthetics.minionNetworkHealthCheckDisabled for a Kubernetes container orchestration system environment. The CPM needs to be able to contact the \"synthetics-horde.nr-data.net\" domain. This is necessary for it to report data to New Relic and to receive monitors to execute. Ask your network administration if this is a problem and how to set up exceptions. Communicate with Synthetics via a proxy To set up communication with New Relic by proxy, use the environment variables named MINION_API_PROXY*. Arguments passed at launch This applies to a Docker container environment only. Arguments passed to the CPM container at launch do not get passed on to the containers spawned by the CPM. Docker has no concept of \"inheritance\" or a \"hierarchy\" of containers, and we don't copy the configuration that is passed from CPM to the monitor-running containers. The only shared configuration between them is the one set at the Docker daemon level.",

Collect custom response codes for more detail on your monitor runs. You'll be able to add and configure synthetic monitors to suit your environnment after you create a New Relic account. (It's free, forever!) Add a monitor You can add several types of synthetic monitors: Ping monitors ensure your website is responding, while simple browser monitors send real browsers to check your website. For more complex monitoring, scripted browser monitors verify that specific resources are present, while API tests verify your API endpoint. The default timeout for a new monitor is 180 seconds. To learn how to use our step monitor to build complex workflow validation scripts without writing any code, watch this short YouTube video (approx. 3:20 minutes). Add a ping or simple browser monitor Go to one.newrelic.com > Synthetics > Create monitor. Specify a monitor type, name, and URL (may be any valid HTTP or HTTPS URL). Optional: Add a validation string or Advanced options: A validation string is available for ping and simple browser. This option enables substring monitoring for response validation. Verify SSL is available for ping and simple browser. This option verifies the validity of the SSL certificate chain. It can be duplicated by running the following syntax: openssl s_client -servername {YOUR_HOSTNAME} -connect {YOUR_HOSTNAME}:443 -CApath /etc/ssl/certs -verify_hostname {YOUR_HOSTNAME} > /dev/null Copy If a non-zero exit code is returned, the monitor will fail. The Bypass HEAD request option is available for ping. This option skips the default HEAD request and instead uses the GET verb with a ping check. Redirect is Failure is available for ping. If a redirect result occurs when Redirect is Failure is enabled, New Relic Synthetics will categorize the result as a failure, rather than following the redirect and checking the resulting URL. Select the locations from which you want your monitor to run. Choose a frequency to determine how often each location will run your monitor. Optional: Set up alert notifications. Select Create my monitor to confirm. Generate some traffic and wait a few minutes, then check your monitor from the Monitors index. Add a scripted browser or API test monitor Go to one.newrelic.com > Synthetics > Create monitor. Specify a monitor type and name. Select the locations from which you want your monitor to run. Choose a frequency to determine how often each location will run your monitor. Optional: Set up alert notifications. Select Next: Write your script to create a script for your scripted browser or API test, then select Validate to verify your syntax. Tip For complex scripts, validation may take up to one minute. Select Create my monitor to confirm. Generate some traffic and wait a few minutes, then check your monitor from the Monitors index. Add a step monitor Go to one.newrelic.com > Synthetics > Create monitor. Select step monitor as the monitor type. Specify a name and choose a frequency to determine how often each location will run your monitor. Select the locations from which you want your monitor to run. Build your monitor by selecting from the preconfigured steps at the bottom of the UI: Navigate to a URL Type text Click an element Assert text Assert an element Secure a credential Use the instructions on the right side of the UI to help locate elements by CSS class, HTML ID, link text, or XPath. Select Save monitor to confirm. Generate some traffic and wait a few minutes, then check your monitor from the Monitors index. Add a certificate check monitor Go to one.newrelic.com > Synthetics > Create monitor. Select the certificate check monitor type. Specify a name and enter the domain you'd like to monitor. Enter the number of days it takes for your certificate to expire. Select the period to determine your monitor's frequency. Optional: Add tags to help you find this monitor later. Select the locations from which you want your monitor to run, and then click Save monitor to confirm. Generate some traffic and wait a few minutes, then check your monitor from the Monitors index. Add a broken links monitor Go to one.newrelic.com > Synthetics > Create monitor. Select the broken links check monitor type.

Optional: Add tags to help you find this monitor later. Select the locations from which you want your monitor to run, and then click Save monitor to confirm. Generate some traffic and wait a few minutes, then check your monitor from the Monitors index. Tip You can also add monitors with the Synthetics REST API. For example, you can create a GET request to the monitor you want to use as the source for configuration, then use those key values to use in a POST to \"copy\" and create a new monitor. Edit a monitor You cannot change a monitor's type after the monitor is created, but you can edit other monitor settings. From the Monitors tab in one.newrelic.com > Synthetics, select the monitor you want to edit. In the side menu, select a link to change the following settings: Select Settings > General to edit name, Apdex T, URL, locations, frequency, and advanced options. For Scripted browser and API test monitors, select Settings > Script to edit your monitor script. For synthetic monitoring alerts, click Manage alerts. Select Save changes to confirm. Delete a monitor You must have Admin privileges in order to delete a monitor. To delete a monitor: From the Monitors tab in one.newrelic.com > Synthetics, select the monitor you want to edit. From the selected monitor, select Settings > General. Scroll to the bottom of the page and select the trash can icon. Tip You can also delete a monitor with the Synthetics REST API. Monitor settings When configuring monitors, the following settings are available: Type Select the type of monitor you want to create. A monitor's type can't be changed after the monitor is created. Ping: Specify a single URL to monitor for availability. New Relic will check this URL via HEAD or GET requests. The non-configurable timeout for this monitor is 60 seconds. Simple browser: Specify a single URL to monitor via real browser. Once each frequency interval, New Relic will check this URL via a Selenium-powered Google Chrome browser. The non-configurable timeout for this monitor is 60 seconds. Scripted browser: Create a script to drive a Selenium-powered Google Chrome browser. The browser follows each step in the script to verify that complex behavior is working as expected (for example, searching a website, then clicking one of the search results). The non-configurable timeout for this monitor is 180 seconds. API test: Create an API script to ensure your API endpoint is working correctly. For more information, see Write API tests. The non-configurable timeout for this monitor is 180 seconds. Monitor name Defines a name for the monitor. Monitor names cannot contain unencoded angle brackets (< >). To include angle brackets in a monitor name, encode them as HTML bracket entities (&lt; &gt;) in the UI or API. Location Select the locations where you want your monitor to run. Select more locations to ensure that your application is available to users around the world. If you have any private locations, they will be listed here too. You can use the Synthetics API location endpoint to retrieve a list of valid locations for your account. Your monitor will run one check from each selected location during each frequency interval. For example, if you select three locations and define a frequency of 15 minutes, your monitor will run three checks in each 15 minute period (or 8,640 checks per month). Frequency Select how often the monitor runs, in increments of minutes, hours, or 1 day. This frequency applies to each location. For example, if you select three locations and a Frequency of 15 minutes, your monitor will run three checks, on average every 5 minutes, in each 15 minute period (or 8,640 checks per month). Alerts Specify an email address to receive alerts when a monitor fails. Or, attach a monitor to an existing alert policy for more notification options. For more information, see Alerting for synthetic monitoring. Apdex T Customize the Apdex T for this monitor. This setting is only available when editing the settings for an existing monitor, not when creating a new monitor. Change the Apdex T from the default 7 seconds for more accurate Apdex scores in your SLA reports. For example, if you have a very long scripted browser, you might adjust the Apdex T to 15 seconds to more closely reflect the usual completion time. Similarly, a good Apdex T for a simple browser check might be only 2 seconds. Response Validation (optional) Specify text to search for on the page. When using simple browser or ping monitor types, there is a 1MB (10^6 bytes) limit on the page load. See a history of monitor changes You can use New Relic One to see a history of recent changes to synthetic monitors and what users changed them.",

      "body": "Synthetic monitors are API checks or virtual browser instances that monitor your website, recording each check in detail. They can also: Capture aggregate numbers, including an overview or summary for ping monitors. Provide detailed statistics for each page resource, and downtime incidents. Collect custom response codes for more detail on your monitor runs. You'll be able to add and configure synthetic monitors to suit your environnment after you create a New Relic account. (It's free, forever!) Add a monitor You can add several types of synthetic monitors: Ping monitors ensure your website is responding, while simple browser monitors send real browsers to check your website. For more complex monitoring, scripted browser monitors verify that specific resources are present, while API tests verify your API endpoint. The default timeout for a new monitor is 180 seconds. To learn how to use our step monitor to build complex workflow validation scripts without writing any code, watch this short YouTube video (approx. 3:20 minutes). Add a ping or simple browser monitor Go to one.newrelic.com > Synthetics > Create monitor. Specify a monitor type, name, and URL (may be any valid HTTP or HTTPS URL). Optional: Add a validation string or Advanced options: A validation string is available for ping and simple browser. This option enables substring monitoring for response validation. Verify SSL is available for ping and simple browser. This option verifies the validity of the SSL certificate chain. It can be duplicated by running the following syntax: openssl s_client -servername {YOUR_HOSTNAME} -connect {YOUR_HOSTNAME}:443 -CApath /etc/ssl/certs -verify_hostname {YOUR_HOSTNAME} > /dev/null Copy If a non-zero exit code is returned, the monitor will fail. The Bypass HEAD request option is available for ping. This option skips the default HEAD request and instead uses the GET verb with a ping check. Redirect is Failure is available for ping. If a redirect result occurs when Redirect is Failure is enabled, New Relic Synthetics will categorize the result as a failure, rather than following the redirect and checking the resulting URL. Select the locations from which you want your monitor to run. Choose a frequency to determine how often each location will run your monitor. Optional: Set up alert notifications. Select Create my monitor to confirm. Generate some traffic and wait a few minutes, then check your monitor from the Monitors index. Add a scripted browser or API test monitor Go to one.newrelic.com > Synthetics > Create monitor. Specify a monitor type and name. Select the locations from which you want your monitor to run. Choose a frequency to determine how often each location will run your monitor. Optional: Set up alert notifications. Select Next: Write your script to create a script for your scripted browser or API test, then select Validate to verify your syntax. Tip For complex scripts, validation may take up to one minute. Select Create my monitor to confirm. Generate some traffic and wait a few minutes, then check your monitor from the Monitors index. Add a step monitor Go to one.newrelic.com > Synthetics > Create monitor. Select step monitor as the monitor type. Specify a name and choose a frequency to determine how often each location will run your monitor. Select the locations from which you want your monitor to run. Build your monitor by selecting from the preconfigured steps at the bottom of the UI: Navigate to a URL Type text Click an element Assert text Assert an element Secure a credential Use the instructions on the right side of the UI to help locate elements by CSS class, HTML ID, link text, or XPath. Select Save monitor to confirm. Generate some traffic and wait a few minutes, then check your monitor from the Monitors index. Add a certificate check monitor Go to one.newrelic.com > Synthetics > Create monitor. Select the certificate check monitor type. Specify a name and enter the domain you'd like to monitor. Enter the number of days it takes for your certificate to expire. Select the period to determine your monitor's frequency. Optional: Add tags to help you find this monitor later. Select the locations from which you want your monitor to run, and then click Save monitor to confirm. Generate some traffic and wait a few minutes, then check your monitor from the Monitors index. Add a broken links monitor Go to one.newrelic.com > Synthetics > Create monitor. Select the broken links check monitor type. Specify a name and enter the URL you'd like to monitor (may be any valid HTTP or HTTPS URL). Select the period to determine your monitor's frequency. Optional: Add tags to help you find this monitor later. Select the locations from which you want your monitor to run, and then click Save monitor to confirm. Generate some traffic and wait a few minutes, then check your monitor from the Monitors index. Tip You can also add monitors with the Synthetics REST API. For example, you can create a GET request to the monitor you want to use as the source for configuration, then use those key values to use in a POST to \"copy\" and create a new monitor. Edit a monitor You cannot change a monitor's type after the monitor is created, but you can edit other monitor settings. From the Monitors tab in one.newrelic.com > Synthetics, select the monitor you want to edit. In the side menu, select a link to change the following settings: Select Settings > General to edit name, Apdex T, URL, locations, frequency, and advanced options. For Scripted browser and API test monitors, select Settings > Script to edit your monitor script. For synthetic monitoring alerts, click Manage alerts. Select Save changes to confirm. Delete a monitor You must have Admin privileges in order to delete a monitor. To delete a monitor: From the Monitors tab in one.newrelic.com > Synthetics, select the monitor you want to edit. From the selected monitor, select Settings > General. Scroll to the bottom of the page and select the trash can icon. Tip You can also delete a monitor with the Synthetics REST API. Monitor settings When configuring monitors, the following settings are available: Type Select the type of monitor you want to create. A monitor's type can't be changed after the monitor is created. Ping: Specify a single URL to monitor for availability. New Relic will check this URL via HEAD or GET requests. The non-configurable timeout for this monitor is 60 seconds. Simple browser: Specify a single URL to monitor via real browser. Once each frequency interval, New Relic will check this URL via a Selenium-powered Google Chrome browser. The non-configurable timeout for this monitor is 60 seconds. Scripted browser: Create a script to drive a Selenium-powered Google Chrome browser. The browser follows each step in the script to verify that complex behavior is working as expected (for example, searching a website, then clicking one of the search results). The non-configurable timeout for this monitor is 180 seconds. API test: Create an API script to ensure your API endpoint is working correctly. For more information, see Write API tests. The non-configurable timeout for this monitor is 180 seconds. Monitor name Defines a name for the monitor. Monitor names cannot contain unencoded angle brackets (< >). To include angle brackets in a monitor name, encode them as HTML bracket entities (&lt; &gt;) in the UI or API. Location Select the locations where you want your monitor to run. Select more locations to ensure that your application is available to users around the world. If you have any private locations, they will be listed here too. You can use the Synthetics API location endpoint to retrieve a list of valid locations for your account. Your monitor will run one check from each selected location during each frequency interval. For example, if you select three locations and define a frequency of 15 minutes, your monitor will run three checks in each 15 minute period (or 8,640 checks per month). Frequency Select how often the monitor runs, in increments of minutes, hours, or 1 day. This frequency applies to each location. For example, if you select three locations and a Frequency of 15 minutes, your monitor will run three checks, on average every 5 minutes, in each 15 minute period (or 8,640 checks per month). Alerts Specify an email address to receive alerts when a monitor fails. Or, attach a monitor to an existing alert policy for more notification options. For more information, see Alerting for synthetic monitoring. Apdex T Customize the Apdex T for this monitor. This setting is only available when editing the settings for an existing monitor, not when creating a new monitor. Change the Apdex T from the default 7 seconds for more accurate Apdex scores in your SLA reports. For example, if you have a very long scripted browser, you might adjust the Apdex T to 15 seconds to more closely reflect the usual completion time. Similarly, a good Apdex T for a simple browser check might be only 2 seconds. Response Validation (optional) Specify text to search for on the page. When using simple browser or ping monitor types, there is a 1MB (10^6 bytes) limit on the page load. See a history of monitor changes You can use New Relic One to see a history of recent changes to synthetic monitors and what users changed them.",

      "body": "You can proactively monitor your website or API endpoints with synthetic monitors. Depending on the type of monitor, you can: Add and edit monitors. Use the Synthetics REST API to manage monitors. Set up monitors from specific locations or for private servers. You can also use the host not reporting feature in infrastructure monitoring. This allows you to take advantage of enhanced monitoring options and be notified when New Relic has stopped receiving data from your hosts. Types of monitors These are the seven types of synthetic monitors: Type of synthetic monitor Description Broken links monitor API name: SCRIPT_API Provide a url and this monitor will test all the links on the page for success. If a failure is detected you can view the individual non-successful links that caused the failure. Certificate check monitor API name: SCRIPT_API Proactively ping your domain certificates based on a configurable threshold. Pair with an alert to ensure you are notified when your certificates need renewed. Ping monitor API name: SIMPLE Ping monitors are the simplest type of monitor. They simply check to see if an application is online. The synthetic ping monitor uses a simple Java HTTP client to make requests to your site. For consistency with other synthetic monitor types, the user agent is identified as Google Chrome. However, the HTTP client is not a full browser, and it does not execute JavaScript. If you need JavaScript functionality, use a simple browser monitor. Step monitor API name: STEP_MONITOR Step monitors are advanced monitors which require no code to set up. The monitor can be configured to: Assert modal Assert text Assert title Assert an element Click an element Dismiss a modal Double click an element Enter a secure credential Hover over an element Locate an element by CSS class, HTML ID, link text, Xpath, or value Navigate to a URL Select from a dropdown Type text Simple browser monitors API name: BROWSER Simple browser monitors essentially are simple, pre-built scripted browser monitors. They make a request to your site using an instance of Google Chrome. Compared to a simple ping monitor, this is a more accurate emulation of an actual customer visit. The user agent is identified as Google Chrome. Scripted browser monitors API name: SCRIPT_BROWSER Scripted browser monitors are used for more sophisticated, customized monitoring. You can create a custom script that navigates your website, takes specific actions, and ensures specific resources are present. The monitor uses Google Chrome browser. You can also use a variety of third-party modules to build your custom monitor. API tests API name: SCRIPT_API API tests are used to monitor your API endpoints. This can ensure that your app server works in addition to your website. New Relic uses the http-request module internally to make HTTP calls to your endpoint and validate the results. You can add and edit synthetic monitors directly in our UI. You can also create some synthetic monitors with Terraform. To learn how, watch this short YouTube video (approx. 3:25 minutes).",

Add a broken links monitor Go to one.newrelic.com > Synthetics > Create monitor. Select the broken links check monitor type. Specify a name and enter the URL you'd like to monitor (may be any valid HTTP or HTTPS URL). Select the period to determine your monitor's frequency. Optional: Add tags to help you find this monitor later. Select the locations from which you want your monitor to run, and then click Save monitor to confirm. Generate some traffic and wait a few minutes, then check your monitor from the Monitors index. Tip You can also add monitors with the Synthetics REST API. For example, you can create a GET request to the monitor you want to use as the source for configuration, then use those key values to use in a POST to \"copy\" and create a new monitor. Edit a monitor You cannot change a monitor's type after the monitor is created, but you can edit other monitor settings. From the Monitors tab in one.newrelic.com > Synthetics, select the monitor you want to edit. In the side menu, select a link to change the following settings: Select Settings > General to edit name, Apdex T, URL, locations, frequency, and advanced options. For Scripted browser and API test monitors, select Settings > Script to edit your monitor script. For synthetic monitoring alerts, click Manage alerts. Select Save changes to confirm. Delete a monitor You must have Admin privileges in order to delete a monitor. To delete a monitor: From the Monitors tab in one.newrelic.com > Synthetics, select the monitor you want to edit. From the selected monitor, select Settings > General. Scroll to the bottom of the page and select the trash can icon. Tip You can also delete a monitor with the Synthetics REST API. Monitor settings When configuring monitors, the following settings are available: Type Select the type of monitor you want to create. A monitor's type can't be changed after the monitor is created. Ping: Specify a single URL to monitor for availability. New Relic will check this URL via HEAD or GET requests. The non-configurable timeout for this monitor is 60 seconds. Simple browser: Specify a single URL to monitor via real browser. Once each frequency interval, New Relic will check this URL via a Selenium-powered Google Chrome browser. The non-configurable timeout for this monitor is 60 seconds. Scripted browser: Create a script to drive a Selenium-powered Google Chrome browser. The browser follows each step in the script to verify that complex behavior is working as expected (for example, searching a website, then clicking one of the search results). The non-configurable timeout for this monitor is 180 seconds. API test: Create an API script to ensure your API endpoint is working correctly. For more information, see Write API tests. The non-configurable timeout for this monitor is 180 seconds. Monitor name Defines a name for the monitor. Monitor names cannot contain unencoded angle brackets (< >). To include angle brackets in a monitor name, encode them as HTML bracket entities (&lt; &gt;) in the UI or API. Location Select the locations where you want your monitor to run. Select more locations to ensure that your application is available to users around the world. If you have any private locations, they will be listed here too. You can use the Synthetics API location endpoint to retrieve a list of valid locations for your account. Your monitor will run one check from each selected location during each frequency interval. For example, if you select three locations and define a frequency of 15 minutes, your monitor will run three checks in each 15 minute period (or 8,640 checks per month). Frequency Select how often the monitor runs, in increments of minutes, hours, or 1 day. This frequency applies to each location. For example, if you select three locations and a Frequency of 15 minutes, your monitor will run three checks, on average every 5 minutes, in each 15 minute period (or 8,640 checks per month). Alerts Specify an email address to receive alerts when a monitor fails. Or, attach a monitor to an existing alert policy for more notification options. For more information, see Alerting for synthetic monitoring. Apdex T Customize the Apdex T for this monitor. This setting is only available when editing the settings for an existing monitor, not when creating a new monitor. Change the Apdex T from the default 7 seconds for more accurate Apdex scores in your SLA reports. For example, if you have a very long scripted browser, you might adjust the Apdex T to 15 seconds to more closely reflect the usual completion time. Similarly, a good Apdex T for a simple browser check might be only 2 seconds. Response Validation (optional) Specify text to search for on the page. When using simple browser or ping monitor types, there is a 1MB (10^6 bytes) limit on the page load.

They can also: Capture aggregate numbers, including an overview or summary for ping monitors. Provide detailed statistics for each page resource, and downtime incidents. Collect custom response codes for more detail on your monitor runs. You'll be able to add and configure synthetic monitors to suit your environnment after you create a New Relic account. (It's free, forever!) Add a monitor You can add several types of synthetic monitors: Ping monitors ensure your website is responding, while simple browser monitors send real browsers to check your website. For more complex monitoring, scripted browser monitors verify that specific resources are present, while API tests verify your API endpoint. The default timeout for a new monitor is 180 seconds. To learn how to use our step monitor to build complex workflow validation scripts without writing any code, watch this short YouTube video (approx. 3:20 minutes). Add a ping or simple browser monitor Go to one.newrelic.com > Synthetics > Create monitor. Specify a monitor type, name, and URL (may be any valid HTTP or HTTPS URL). Optional: Add a validation string or Advanced options: A validation string is available for ping and simple browser. This option enables substring monitoring for response validation. Verify SSL is available for ping and simple browser. This option verifies the validity of the SSL certificate chain. It can be duplicated by running the following syntax: openssl s_client -servername {YOUR_HOSTNAME} -connect {YOUR_HOSTNAME}:443 -CApath /etc/ssl/certs -verify_hostname {YOUR_HOSTNAME} > /dev/null Copy If a non-zero exit code is returned, the monitor will fail. The Bypass HEAD request option is available for ping. This option skips the default HEAD request and instead uses the GET verb with a ping check. Redirect is Failure is available for ping. If a redirect result occurs when Redirect is Failure is enabled, New Relic Synthetics will categorize the result as a failure, rather than following the redirect and checking the resulting URL.

They can also: Capture aggregate numbers, including an overview or summary for ping monitors. Provide detailed statistics for each page resource, and downtime incidents. Collect custom response codes for more detail on your monitor runs. You'll be able to add and configure synthetic monitors to suit your environnment after you create a New Relic account. (It's free, forever!) Add a monitor You can add several types of synthetic monitors: Ping monitors ensure your website is responding, while simple browser monitors send real browsers to check your website. For more complex monitoring, scripted browser monitors verify that specific resources are present, while API tests verify your API endpoint. The default timeout for a new monitor is 180 seconds. To learn how to use our step monitor to build complex workflow validation scripts without writing any code, watch this short YouTube video (approx. 3:20 minutes). Add a ping or simple browser monitor Go to one.newrelic.com > Synthetics > Create monitor. Specify a monitor type, name, and URL (may be any valid HTTP or HTTPS URL). Optional: Add a validation string or Advanced options: A validation string is available for ping and simple browser. This option enables substring monitoring for response validation. Verify SSL is available for ping and simple browser. This option verifies the validity of the SSL certificate chain. It can be duplicated by running the following syntax: openssl s_client -servername {YOUR_HOSTNAME} -connect {YOUR_HOSTNAME}:443 -CApath /etc/ssl/certs -verify_hostname {YOUR_HOSTNAME} > /dev/null Copy If a non-zero exit code is returned, the monitor will fail. The Bypass HEAD request option is available for ping. This option skips the default HEAD request and instead uses the GET verb with a ping check. Redirect is Failure is available for ping. If a redirect result occurs when Redirect is Failure is enabled, New Relic Synthetics will categorize the result as a failure, rather than following the redirect and checking the resulting URL. Select the locations from which you want your monitor to run. Choose a frequency to determine how often each location will run your monitor. Optional: Set up alert notifications. Select Create my monitor to confirm. Generate some traffic and wait a few minutes, then check your monitor from the Monitors index. Add a scripted browser or API test monitor Go to one.newrelic.com > Synthetics > Create monitor. Specify a monitor type and name. Select the locations from which you want your monitor to run. Choose a frequency to determine how often each location will run your monitor. Optional: Set up alert notifications. Select Next: Write your script to create a script for your scripted browser or API test, then select Validate to verify your syntax. Tip For complex scripts, validation may take up to one minute. Select Create my monitor to confirm. Generate some traffic and wait a few minutes, then check your monitor from the Monitors index. Add a step monitor Go to one.newrelic.com > Synthetics > Create monitor. Select step monitor as the monitor type. Specify a name and choose a frequency to determine how often each location will run your monitor. Select the locations from which you want your monitor to run. Build your monitor by selecting from the preconfigured steps at the bottom of the UI: Navigate to a URL Type text Click an element Assert text Assert an element Secure a credential Use the instructions on the right side of the UI to help locate elements by CSS class, HTML ID, link text, or XPath. Select Save monitor to confirm. Generate some traffic and wait a few minutes, then check your monitor from the Monitors index. Add a certificate check monitor Go to one.newrelic.com > Synthetics > Create monitor. Select the certificate check monitor type. Specify a name and enter the domain you'd like to monitor. Enter the number of days it takes for your certificate to expire. Select the period to determine your monitor's frequency. Optional: Add tags to help you find this monitor later. Select the locations from which you want your monitor to run, and then click Save monitor to confirm. Generate some traffic and wait a few minutes, then check your monitor from the Monitors index. Add a broken links monitor Go to one.newrelic.com > Synthetics > Create monitor. Select the broken links check monitor type. Specify a name and enter the URL you'd like to monitor (may be any valid HTTP or HTTPS URL). Select the period to determine your monitor's frequency. Optional: Add tags to help you find this monitor later. Select the locations from which you want your monitor to run, and then click Save monitor to confirm. Generate some traffic and wait a few minutes, then check your monitor from the Monitors index. Tip You can also add monitors with the Synthetics REST API. For example, you can create a GET request to the monitor you want to use as the source for configuration, then use those key values to use in a POST to \"copy\" and create a new monitor. Edit a monitor You cannot change a monitor's type after the monitor is created, but you can edit other monitor settings. From the Monitors tab in one.newrelic.com > Synthetics, select the monitor you want to edit. In the side menu, select a link to change the following settings: Select Settings > General to edit name, Apdex T, URL, locations, frequency, and advanced options. For Scripted browser and API test monitors, select Settings > Script to edit your monitor script. For synthetic monitoring alerts, click Manage alerts. Select Save changes to confirm. Delete a monitor You must have Admin privileges in order to delete a monitor. To delete a monitor: From the Monitors tab in one.newrelic.com > Synthetics, select the monitor you want to edit. From the selected monitor, select Settings > General. Scroll to the bottom of the page and select the trash can icon. Tip You can also delete a monitor with the Synthetics REST API. Monitor settings When configuring monitors, the following settings are available: Type Select the type of monitor you want to create. A monitor's type can't be changed after the monitor is created. Ping: Specify a single URL to monitor for availability. New Relic will check this URL via HEAD or GET requests. The non-configurable timeout for this monitor is 60 seconds. Simple browser: Specify a single URL to monitor via real browser. Once each frequency interval, New Relic will check this URL via a Selenium-powered Google Chrome browser. The non-configurable timeout for this monitor is 60 seconds. Scripted browser: Create a script to drive a Selenium-powered Google Chrome browser. The browser follows each step in the script to verify that complex behavior is working as expected (for example, searching a website, then clicking one of the search results). The non-configurable timeout for this monitor is 180 seconds. API test: Create an API script to ensure your API endpoint is working correctly. For more information, see Write API tests. The non-configurable timeout for this monitor is 180 seconds. Monitor name Defines a name for the monitor. Monitor names cannot contain unencoded angle brackets (< >). To include angle brackets in a monitor name, encode them as HTML bracket entities (&lt; &gt;) in the UI or API. Location Select the locations where you want your monitor to run. Select more locations to ensure that your application is available to users around the world. If you have any private locations, they will be listed here too. You can use the Synthetics API location endpoint to retrieve a list of valid locations for your account. Your monitor will run one check from each selected location during each frequency interval. For example, if you select three locations and define a frequency of 15 minutes, your monitor will run three checks in each 15 minute period (or 8,640 checks per month). Frequency Select how often the monitor runs, in increments of minutes, hours, or 1 day. This frequency applies to each location. For example, if you select three locations and a Frequency of 15 minutes, your monitor will run three checks, on average every 5 minutes, in each 15 minute period (or 8,640 checks per month). Alerts Specify an email address to receive alerts when a monitor fails. Or, attach a monitor to an existing alert policy for more notification options. For more information, see Alerting for synthetic monitoring. Apdex T Customize the Apdex T for this monitor. This setting is only available when editing the settings for an existing monitor, not when creating a new monitor. Change the Apdex T from the default 7 seconds for more accurate Apdex scores in your SLA reports. For example, if you have a very long scripted browser, you might adjust the Apdex T to 15 seconds to more closely reflect the usual completion time. Similarly, a good Apdex T for a simple browser check might be only 2 seconds. Response Validation (optional) Specify text to search for on the page. When using simple browser or ping monitor types, there is a 1MB (10^6 bytes) limit on the page load. See a history of monitor changes You can use New Relic One to see a history of recent changes to synthetic monitors and what users changed them.",

Use the Synthetics REST API to manage monitors. Set up monitors from specific locations or for private servers. You can also use the host not reporting feature in infrastructure monitoring. This allows you to take advantage of enhanced monitoring options and be notified when New Relic has stopped receiving data from your hosts. Types of monitors These are the seven types of synthetic monitors: Type of synthetic monitor Description Broken links monitor API name: SCRIPT_API Provide a url and this monitor will test all the links on the page for success. If a failure is detected you can view the individual non-successful links that caused the failure. Certificate check monitor API name: SCRIPT_API Proactively ping your domain certificates based on a configurable threshold. Pair with an alert to ensure you are notified when your certificates need renewed. Ping monitor API name: SIMPLE Ping monitors are the simplest type of monitor. They simply check to see if an application is online. The synthetic ping monitor uses a simple Java HTTP client to make requests to your site. For consistency with other synthetic monitor types, the user agent is identified as Google Chrome. However, the HTTP client is not a full browser, and it does not execute JavaScript. If you need JavaScript functionality, use a simple browser monitor. Step monitor API name: STEP_MONITOR Step monitors are advanced monitors which require no code to set up. The monitor can be configured to: Assert modal Assert text Assert title Assert an element Click an element Dismiss a modal Double click an element Enter a secure credential Hover over an element Locate an element by CSS class, HTML ID, link text, Xpath, or value Navigate to a URL Select from a dropdown Type text Simple browser monitors API name: BROWSER Simple browser monitors essentially are simple, pre-built scripted browser monitors. They make a request to your site using an instance of Google Chrome. Compared to a simple ping monitor, this is a more accurate emulation of an actual customer visit. The user agent is identified as Google Chrome. Scripted browser monitors API name: SCRIPT_BROWSER Scripted browser monitors are used for more sophisticated, customized monitoring. You can create a custom script that navigates your website, takes specific actions, and ensures specific resources are present. The monitor uses Google Chrome browser. You can also use a variety of third-party modules to build your custom monitor. API tests API name: SCRIPT_API API tests are used to monitor your API endpoints. This can ensure that your app server works in addition to your website. New Relic uses the http-request module internally to make HTTP calls to your endpoint and validate the results. You can add and edit synthetic monitors directly in our UI. You can also create some synthetic monitors with Terraform. To learn how, watch this short YouTube video (approx. 3:25 minutes).",

Select the locations from which you want your monitor to run, and then click Save monitor to confirm. Generate some traffic and wait a few minutes, then check your monitor from the Monitors index. Add a broken links monitor Go to one.newrelic.com > Synthetics > Create monitor. Select the broken links check monitor type. Specify a name and enter the URL you'd like to monitor (may be any valid HTTP or HTTPS URL). Select the period to determine your monitor's frequency. Optional: Add tags to help you find this monitor later. Select the locations from which you want your monitor to run, and then click Save monitor to confirm. Generate some traffic and wait a few minutes, then check your monitor from the Monitors index. Tip You can also add monitors with the Synthetics REST API. For example, you can create a GET request to the monitor you want to use as the source for configuration, then use those key values to use in a POST to \"copy\" and create a new monitor. Edit a monitor You cannot change a monitor's type after the monitor is created, but you can edit other monitor settings. From the Monitors tab in one.newrelic.com > Synthetics, select the monitor you want to edit. In the side menu, select a link to change the following settings: Select Settings > General to edit name, Apdex T, URL, locations, frequency, and advanced options. For Scripted browser and API test monitors, select Settings > Script to edit your monitor script. For synthetic monitoring alerts, click Manage alerts. Select Save changes to confirm. Delete a monitor You must have Admin privileges in order to delete a monitor. To delete a monitor: From the Monitors tab in one.newrelic.com > Synthetics, select the monitor you want to edit. From the selected monitor, select Settings > General. Scroll to the bottom of the page and select the trash can icon. Tip You can also delete a monitor with the Synthetics REST API. Monitor settings When configuring monitors, the following settings are available: Type Select the type of monitor you want to create. A monitor's type can't be changed after the monitor is created. Ping: Specify a single URL to monitor for availability. New Relic will check this URL via HEAD or GET requests. The non-configurable timeout for this monitor is 60 seconds. Simple browser: Specify a single URL to monitor via real browser. Once each frequency interval, New Relic will check this URL via a Selenium-powered Google Chrome browser. The non-configurable timeout for this monitor is 60 seconds. Scripted browser: Create a script to drive a Selenium-powered Google Chrome browser. The browser follows each step in the script to verify that complex behavior is working as expected (for example, searching a website, then clicking one of the search results). The non-configurable timeout for this monitor is 180 seconds. API test: Create an API script to ensure your API endpoint is working correctly. For more information, see Write API tests. The non-configurable timeout for this monitor is 180 seconds. Monitor name Defines a name for the monitor. Monitor names cannot contain unencoded angle brackets (< >). To include angle brackets in a monitor name, encode them as HTML bracket entities (&lt; &gt;) in the UI or API. Location Select the locations where you want your monitor to run. Select more locations to ensure that your application is available to users around the world. If you have any private locations, they will be listed here too. You can use the Synthetics API location endpoint to retrieve a list of valid locations for your account. Your monitor will run one check from each selected location during each frequency interval. For example, if you select three locations and define a frequency of 15 minutes, your monitor will run three checks in each 15 minute period (or 8,640 checks per month). Frequency Select how often the monitor runs, in increments of minutes, hours, or 1 day. This frequency applies to each location. For example, if you select three locations and a Frequency of 15 minutes, your monitor will run three checks, on average every 5 minutes, in each 15 minute period (or 8,640 checks per month). Alerts Specify an email address to receive alerts when a monitor fails. Or, attach a monitor to an existing alert policy for more notification options. For more information, see Alerting for synthetic monitoring. Apdex T Customize the Apdex T for this monitor. This setting is only available when editing the settings for an existing monitor, not when creating a new monitor. Change the Apdex T from the default 7 seconds for more accurate Apdex scores in your SLA reports. For example, if you have a very long scripted browser, you might adjust the Apdex T to 15 seconds to more closely reflect the usual completion time. Similarly, a good Apdex T for a simple browser check might be only 2 seconds. Response Validation (optional) Specify text to search for on the page. When using simple browser or ping monitor types, there is a 1MB (10^6 bytes) limit on the page load.

They can also: Capture aggregate numbers, including an overview or summary for ping monitors. Provide detailed statistics for each page resource, and downtime incidents. Collect custom response codes for more detail on your monitor runs. You'll be able to add and configure synthetic monitors to suit your environnment after you create a New Relic account. (It's free, forever!) Add a monitor You can add several types of synthetic monitors: Ping monitors ensure your website is responding, while simple browser monitors send real browsers to check your website. For more complex monitoring, scripted browser monitors verify that specific resources are present, while API tests verify your API endpoint. The default timeout for a new monitor is 180 seconds. To learn how to use our step monitor to build complex workflow validation scripts without writing any code, watch this short YouTube video (approx. 3:20 minutes). Add a ping or simple browser monitor Go to one.newrelic.com > Synthetics > Create monitor. Specify a monitor type, name, and URL (may be any valid HTTP or HTTPS URL). Optional: Add a validation string or Advanced options: A validation string is available for ping and simple browser. This option enables substring monitoring for response validation. Verify SSL is available for ping and simple browser. This option verifies the validity of the SSL certificate chain. It can be duplicated by running the following syntax: openssl s_client -servername {YOUR_HOSTNAME} -connect {YOUR_HOSTNAME}:443 -CApath /etc/ssl/certs -verify_hostname {YOUR_HOSTNAME} > /dev/null Copy If a non-zero exit code is returned, the monitor will fail. The Bypass HEAD request option is available for ping. This option skips the default HEAD request and instead uses the GET verb with a ping check. Redirect is Failure is available for ping. If a redirect result occurs when Redirect is Failure is enabled, New Relic Synthetics will categorize the result as a failure, rather than following the redirect and checking the resulting URL.

They can also: Capture aggregate numbers, including an overview or summary for ping monitors. Provide detailed statistics for each page resource, and downtime incidents. Collect custom response codes for more detail on your monitor runs. You'll be able to add and configure synthetic monitors to suit your environnment after you create a New Relic account. (It's free, forever!) Add a monitor You can add several types of synthetic monitors: Ping monitors ensure your website is responding, while simple browser monitors send real browsers to check your website. For more complex monitoring, scripted browser monitors verify that specific resources are present, while API tests verify your API endpoint. The default timeout for a new monitor is 180 seconds. To learn how to use our step monitor to build complex workflow validation scripts without writing any code, watch this short YouTube video (approx. 3:20 minutes). Add a ping or simple browser monitor Go to one.newrelic.com > Synthetics > Create monitor. Specify a monitor type, name, and URL (may be any valid HTTP or HTTPS URL). Optional: Add a validation string or Advanced options: A validation string is available for ping and simple browser. This option enables substring monitoring for response validation. Verify SSL is available for ping and simple browser. This option verifies the validity of the SSL certificate chain. It can be duplicated by running the following syntax: openssl s_client -servername {YOUR_HOSTNAME} -connect {YOUR_HOSTNAME}:443 -CApath /etc/ssl/certs -verify_hostname {YOUR_HOSTNAME} > /dev/null Copy If a non-zero exit code is returned, the monitor will fail. The Bypass HEAD request option is available for ping. This option skips the default HEAD request and instead uses the GET verb with a ping check. Redirect is Failure is available for ping. If a redirect result occurs when Redirect is Failure is enabled, New Relic Synthetics will categorize the result as a failure, rather than following the redirect and checking the resulting URL. Select the locations from which you want your monitor to run. Choose a frequency to determine how often each location will run your monitor. Optional: Set up alert notifications. Select Create my monitor to confirm. Generate some traffic and wait a few minutes, then check your monitor from the Monitors index. Add a scripted browser or API test monitor Go to one.newrelic.com > Synthetics > Create monitor. Specify a monitor type and name. Select the locations from which you want your monitor to run. Choose a frequency to determine how often each location will run your monitor. Optional: Set up alert notifications. Select Next: Write your script to create a script for your scripted browser or API test, then select Validate to verify your syntax. Tip For complex scripts, validation may take up to one minute. Select Create my monitor to confirm. Generate some traffic and wait a few minutes, then check your monitor from the Monitors index. Add a step monitor Go to one.newrelic.com > Synthetics > Create monitor. Select step monitor as the monitor type. Specify a name and choose a frequency to determine how often each location will run your monitor. Select the locations from which you want your monitor to run. Build your monitor by selecting from the preconfigured steps at the bottom of the UI: Navigate to a URL Type text Click an element Assert text Assert an element Secure a credential Use the instructions on the right side of the UI to help locate elements by CSS class, HTML ID, link text, or XPath. Select Save monitor to confirm. Generate some traffic and wait a few minutes, then check your monitor from the Monitors index. Add a certificate check monitor Go to one.newrelic.com > Synthetics > Create monitor. Select the certificate check monitor type. Specify a name and enter the domain you'd like to monitor. Enter the number of days it takes for your certificate to expire. Select the period to determine your monitor's frequency. Optional: Add tags to help you find this monitor later. Select the locations from which you want your monitor to run, and then click Save monitor to confirm. Generate some traffic and wait a few minutes, then check your monitor from the Monitors index. Add a broken links monitor Go to one.newrelic.com > Synthetics > Create monitor. Select the broken links check monitor type. Specify a name and enter the URL you'd like to monitor (may be any valid HTTP or HTTPS URL). Select the period to determine your monitor's frequency. Optional: Add tags to help you find this monitor later. Select the locations from which you want your monitor to run, and then click Save monitor to confirm. Generate some traffic and wait a few minutes, then check your monitor from the Monitors index. Tip You can also add monitors with the Synthetics REST API. For example, you can create a GET request to the monitor you want to use as the source for configuration, then use those key values to use in a POST to \"copy\" and create a new monitor. Edit a monitor You cannot change a monitor's type after the monitor is created, but you can edit other monitor settings. From the Monitors tab in one.newrelic.com > Synthetics, select the monitor you want to edit. In the side menu, select a link to change the following settings: Select Settings > General to edit name, Apdex T, URL, locations, frequency, and advanced options. For Scripted browser and API test monitors, select Settings > Script to edit your monitor script. For synthetic monitoring alerts, click Manage alerts. Select Save changes to confirm. Delete a monitor You must have Admin privileges in order to delete a monitor. To delete a monitor: From the Monitors tab in one.newrelic.com > Synthetics, select the monitor you want to edit. From the selected monitor, select Settings > General. Scroll to the bottom of the page and select the trash can icon. Tip You can also delete a monitor with the Synthetics REST API. Monitor settings When configuring monitors, the following settings are available: Type Select the type of monitor you want to create. A monitor's type can't be changed after the monitor is created. Ping: Specify a single URL to monitor for availability. New Relic will check this URL via HEAD or GET requests. The non-configurable timeout for this monitor is 60 seconds. Simple browser: Specify a single URL to monitor via real browser. Once each frequency interval, New Relic will check this URL via a Selenium-powered Google Chrome browser. The non-configurable timeout for this monitor is 60 seconds. Scripted browser: Create a script to drive a Selenium-powered Google Chrome browser. The browser follows each step in the script to verify that complex behavior is working as expected (for example, searching a website, then clicking one of the search results). The non-configurable timeout for this monitor is 180 seconds. API test: Create an API script to ensure your API endpoint is working correctly. For more information, see Write API tests. The non-configurable timeout for this monitor is 180 seconds. Monitor name Defines a name for the monitor. Monitor names cannot contain unencoded angle brackets (< >). To include angle brackets in a monitor name, encode them as HTML bracket entities (&lt; &gt;) in the UI or API. Location Select the locations where you want your monitor to run. Select more locations to ensure that your application is available to users around the world. If you have any private locations, they will be listed here too. You can use the Synthetics API location endpoint to retrieve a list of valid locations for your account. Your monitor will run one check from each selected location during each frequency interval. For example, if you select three locations and define a frequency of 15 minutes, your monitor will run three checks in each 15 minute period (or 8,640 checks per month). Frequency Select how often the monitor runs, in increments of minutes, hours, or 1 day. This frequency applies to each location. For example, if you select three locations and a Frequency of 15 minutes, your monitor will run three checks, on average every 5 minutes, in each 15 minute period (or 8,640 checks per month). Alerts Specify an email address to receive alerts when a monitor fails. Or, attach a monitor to an existing alert policy for more notification options. For more information, see Alerting for synthetic monitoring. Apdex T Customize the Apdex T for this monitor. This setting is only available when editing the settings for an existing monitor, not when creating a new monitor. Change the Apdex T from the default 7 seconds for more accurate Apdex scores in your SLA reports. For example, if you have a very long scripted browser, you might adjust the Apdex T to 15 seconds to more closely reflect the usual completion time. Similarly, a good Apdex T for a simple browser check might be only 2 seconds. Response Validation (optional) Specify text to search for on the page. When using simple browser or ping monitor types, there is a 1MB (10^6 bytes) limit on the page load. See a history of monitor changes You can use New Relic One to see a history of recent changes to synthetic monitors and what users changed them.",

Use the Synthetics REST API to manage monitors. Set up monitors from specific locations or for private servers. You can also use the host not reporting feature in infrastructure monitoring. This allows you to take advantage of enhanced monitoring options and be notified when New Relic has stopped receiving data from your hosts. Types of monitors These are the seven types of synthetic monitors: Type of synthetic monitor Description Broken links monitor API name: SCRIPT_API Provide a url and this monitor will test all the links on the page for success. If a failure is detected you can view the individual non-successful links that caused the failure. Certificate check monitor API name: SCRIPT_API Proactively ping your domain certificates based on a configurable threshold. Pair with an alert to ensure you are notified when your certificates need renewed. Ping monitor API name: SIMPLE Ping monitors are the simplest type of monitor. They simply check to see if an application is online. The synthetic ping monitor uses a simple Java HTTP client to make requests to your site. For consistency with other synthetic monitor types, the user agent is identified as Google Chrome. However, the HTTP client is not a full browser, and it does not execute JavaScript. If you need JavaScript functionality, use a simple browser monitor. Step monitor API name: STEP_MONITOR Step monitors are advanced monitors which require no code to set up. The monitor can be configured to: Assert modal Assert text Assert title Assert an element Click an element Dismiss a modal Double click an element Enter a secure credential Hover over an element Locate an element by CSS class, HTML ID, link text, Xpath, or value Navigate to a URL Select from a dropdown Type text Simple browser monitors API name: BROWSER Simple browser monitors essentially are simple, pre-built scripted browser monitors. They make a request to your site using an instance of Google Chrome. Compared to a simple ping monitor, this is a more accurate emulation of an actual customer visit. The user agent is identified as Google Chrome. Scripted browser monitors API name: SCRIPT_BROWSER Scripted browser monitors are used for more sophisticated, customized monitoring. You can create a custom script that navigates your website, takes specific actions, and ensures specific resources are present. The monitor uses Google Chrome browser. You can also use a variety of third-party modules to build your custom monitor. API tests API name: SCRIPT_API API tests are used to monitor your API endpoints. This can ensure that your app server works in addition to your website. New Relic uses the http-request module internally to make HTTP calls to your endpoint and validate the results. You can add and edit synthetic monitors directly in our UI. You can also create some synthetic monitors with Terraform. To learn how, watch this short YouTube video (approx. 3:25 minutes).",

Enter the number of days it takes for your certificate to expire. Select the period to determine your monitor's frequency. Optional: Add tags to help you find this monitor later. Select the locations from which you want your monitor to run, and then click Save monitor to confirm. Generate some traffic and wait a few minutes, then check your monitor from the Monitors index. Add a broken links monitor Go to one.newrelic.com > Synthetics > Create monitor. Select the broken links check monitor type. Specify a name and enter the URL you'd like to monitor (may be any valid HTTP or HTTPS URL). Select the period to determine your monitor's frequency. Optional: Add tags to help you find this monitor later. Select the locations from which you want your monitor to run, and then click Save monitor to confirm. Generate some traffic and wait a few minutes, then check your monitor from the Monitors index. Tip You can also add monitors with the Synthetics REST API. For example, you can create a GET request to the monitor you want to use as the source for configuration, then use those key values to use in a POST to \"copy\" and create a new monitor. Edit a monitor You cannot change a monitor's type after the monitor is created, but you can edit other monitor settings. From the Monitors tab in one.newrelic.com > Synthetics, select the monitor you want to edit. In the side menu, select a link to change the following settings: Select Settings > General to edit name, Apdex T, URL, locations, frequency, and advanced options. For Scripted browser and API test monitors, select Settings > Script to edit your monitor script. For synthetic monitoring alerts, click Manage alerts. Select Save changes to confirm. Delete a monitor You must have Admin privileges in order to delete a monitor. To delete a monitor: From the Monitors tab in one.newrelic.com > Synthetics, select the monitor you want to edit. From the selected monitor, select Settings > General. Scroll to the bottom of the page and select the trash can icon. Tip You can also delete a monitor with the Synthetics REST API. Monitor settings When configuring monitors, the following settings are available: Type Select the type of monitor you want to create. A monitor's type can't be changed after the monitor is created. Ping: Specify a single URL to monitor for availability. New Relic will check this URL via HEAD or GET requests. The non-configurable timeout for this monitor is 60 seconds. Simple browser: Specify a single URL to monitor via real browser. Once each frequency interval, New Relic will check this URL via a Selenium-powered Google Chrome browser. The non-configurable timeout for this monitor is 60 seconds. Scripted browser: Create a script to drive a Selenium-powered Google Chrome browser. The browser follows each step in the script to verify that complex behavior is working as expected (for example, searching a website, then clicking one of the search results). The non-configurable timeout for this monitor is 180 seconds. API test: Create an API script to ensure your API endpoint is working correctly. For more information, see Write API tests. The non-configurable timeout for this monitor is 180 seconds. Monitor name Defines a name for the monitor. Monitor names cannot contain unencoded angle brackets (< >). To include angle brackets in a monitor name, encode them as HTML bracket entities (&lt; &gt;) in the UI or API. Location Select the locations where you want your monitor to run. Select more locations to ensure that your application is available to users around the world. If you have any private locations, they will be listed here too. You can use the Synthetics API location endpoint to retrieve a list of valid locations for your account. Your monitor will run one check from each selected location during each frequency interval. For example, if you select three locations and define a frequency of 15 minutes, your monitor will run three checks in each 15 minute period (or 8,640 checks per month). Frequency Select how often the monitor runs, in increments of minutes, hours, or 1 day. This frequency applies to each location. For example, if you select three locations and a Frequency of 15 minutes, your monitor will run three checks, on average every 5 minutes, in each 15 minute period (or 8,640 checks per month). Alerts Specify an email address to receive alerts when a monitor fails. Or, attach a monitor to an existing alert policy for more notification options. For more information, see Alerting for synthetic monitoring. Apdex T Customize the Apdex T for this monitor. This setting is only available when editing the settings for an existing monitor, not when creating a new monitor. Change the Apdex T from the default 7 seconds for more accurate Apdex scores in your SLA reports. For example, if you have a very long scripted browser, you might adjust the Apdex T to 15 seconds to more closely reflect the usual completion time. Similarly, a good Apdex T for a simple browser check might be only 2 seconds. Response Validation (optional) Specify text to search for on the page. When using simple browser or ping monitor types, there is a 1MB (10^6 bytes) limit on the page load.

They can also: Capture aggregate numbers, including an overview or summary for ping monitors. Provide detailed statistics for each page resource, and downtime incidents. Collect custom response codes for more detail on your monitor runs. You'll be able to add and configure synthetic monitors to suit your environnment after you create a New Relic account. (It's free, forever!) Add a monitor You can add several types of synthetic monitors: Ping monitors ensure your website is responding, while simple browser monitors send real browsers to check your website. For more complex monitoring, scripted browser monitors verify that specific resources are present, while API tests verify your API endpoint. The default timeout for a new monitor is 180 seconds. To learn how to use our step monitor to build complex workflow validation scripts without writing any code, watch this short YouTube video (approx. 3:20 minutes). Add a ping or simple browser monitor Go to one.newrelic.com > Synthetics > Create monitor. Specify a monitor type, name, and URL (may be any valid HTTP or HTTPS URL). Optional: Add a validation string or Advanced options: A validation string is available for ping and simple browser. This option enables substring monitoring for response validation. Verify SSL is available for ping and simple browser. This option verifies the validity of the SSL certificate chain. It can be duplicated by running the following syntax: openssl s_client -servername {YOUR_HOSTNAME} -connect {YOUR_HOSTNAME}:443 -CApath /etc/ssl/certs -verify_hostname {YOUR_HOSTNAME} > /dev/null Copy If a non-zero exit code is returned, the monitor will fail. The Bypass HEAD request option is available for ping. This option skips the default HEAD request and instead uses the GET verb with a ping check. Redirect is Failure is available for ping. If a redirect result occurs when Redirect is Failure is enabled, New Relic Synthetics will categorize the result as a failure, rather than following the redirect and checking the resulting URL.

They can also: Capture aggregate numbers, including an overview or summary for ping monitors. Provide detailed statistics for each page resource, and downtime incidents. Collect custom response codes for more detail on your monitor runs. You'll be able to add and configure synthetic monitors to suit your environnment after you create a New Relic account. (It's free, forever!) Add a monitor You can add several types of synthetic monitors: Ping monitors ensure your website is responding, while simple browser monitors send real browsers to check your website. For more complex monitoring, scripted browser monitors verify that specific resources are present, while API tests verify your API endpoint. The default timeout for a new monitor is 180 seconds. To learn how to use our step monitor to build complex workflow validation scripts without writing any code, watch this short YouTube video (approx. 3:20 minutes). Add a ping or simple browser monitor Go to one.newrelic.com > Synthetics > Create monitor. Specify a monitor type, name, and URL (may be any valid HTTP or HTTPS URL). Optional: Add a validation string or Advanced options: A validation string is available for ping and simple browser. This option enables substring monitoring for response validation. Verify SSL is available for ping and simple browser. This option verifies the validity of the SSL certificate chain. It can be duplicated by running the following syntax: openssl s_client -servername {YOUR_HOSTNAME} -connect {YOUR_HOSTNAME}:443 -CApath /etc/ssl/certs -verify_hostname {YOUR_HOSTNAME} > /dev/null Copy If a non-zero exit code is returned, the monitor will fail. The Bypass HEAD request option is available for ping. This option skips the default HEAD request and instead uses the GET verb with a ping check. Redirect is Failure is available for ping. If a redirect result occurs when Redirect is Failure is enabled, New Relic Synthetics will categorize the result as a failure, rather than following the redirect and checking the resulting URL. Select the locations from which you want your monitor to run. Choose a frequency to determine how often each location will run your monitor. Optional: Set up alert notifications. Select Create my monitor to confirm. Generate some traffic and wait a few minutes, then check your monitor from the Monitors index. Add a scripted browser or API test monitor Go to one.newrelic.com > Synthetics > Create monitor. Specify a monitor type and name. Select the locations from which you want your monitor to run. Choose a frequency to determine how often each location will run your monitor. Optional: Set up alert notifications. Select Next: Write your script to create a script for your scripted browser or API test, then select Validate to verify your syntax. Tip For complex scripts, validation may take up to one minute. Select Create my monitor to confirm. Generate some traffic and wait a few minutes, then check your monitor from the Monitors index. Add a step monitor Go to one.newrelic.com > Synthetics > Create monitor. Select step monitor as the monitor type. Specify a name and choose a frequency to determine how often each location will run your monitor. Select the locations from which you want your monitor to run. Build your monitor by selecting from the preconfigured steps at the bottom of the UI: Navigate to a URL Type text Click an element Assert text Assert an element Secure a credential Use the instructions on the right side of the UI to help locate elements by CSS class, HTML ID, link text, or XPath. Select Save monitor to confirm. Generate some traffic and wait a few minutes, then check your monitor from the Monitors index. Add a certificate check monitor Go to one.newrelic.com > Synthetics > Create monitor. Select the certificate check monitor type. Specify a name and enter the domain you'd like to monitor. Enter the number of days it takes for your certificate to expire. Select the period to determine your monitor's frequency. Optional: Add tags to help you find this monitor later. Select the locations from which you want your monitor to run, and then click Save monitor to confirm. Generate some traffic and wait a few minutes, then check your monitor from the Monitors index. Add a broken links monitor Go to one.newrelic.com > Synthetics > Create monitor. Select the broken links check monitor type. Specify a name and enter the URL you'd like to monitor (may be any valid HTTP or HTTPS URL). Select the period to determine your monitor's frequency. Optional: Add tags to help you find this monitor later. Select the locations from which you want your monitor to run, and then click Save monitor to confirm. Generate some traffic and wait a few minutes, then check your monitor from the Monitors index. Tip You can also add monitors with the Synthetics REST API. For example, you can create a GET request to the monitor you want to use as the source for configuration, then use those key values to use in a POST to \"copy\" and create a new monitor. Edit a monitor You cannot change a monitor's type after the monitor is created, but you can edit other monitor settings. From the Monitors tab in one.newrelic.com > Synthetics, select the monitor you want to edit. In the side menu, select a link to change the following settings: Select Settings > General to edit name, Apdex T, URL, locations, frequency, and advanced options. For Scripted browser and API test monitors, select Settings > Script to edit your monitor script. For synthetic monitoring alerts, click Manage alerts. Select Save changes to confirm. Delete a monitor You must have Admin privileges in order to delete a monitor. To delete a monitor: From the Monitors tab in one.newrelic.com > Synthetics, select the monitor you want to edit. From the selected monitor, select Settings > General. Scroll to the bottom of the page and select the trash can icon. Tip You can also delete a monitor with the Synthetics REST API. Monitor settings When configuring monitors, the following settings are available: Type Select the type of monitor you want to create. A monitor's type can't be changed after the monitor is created. Ping: Specify a single URL to monitor for availability. New Relic will check this URL via HEAD or GET requests. The non-configurable timeout for this monitor is 60 seconds. Simple browser: Specify a single URL to monitor via real browser. Once each frequency interval, New Relic will check this URL via a Selenium-powered Google Chrome browser. The non-configurable timeout for this monitor is 60 seconds. Scripted browser: Create a script to drive a Selenium-powered Google Chrome browser. The browser follows each step in the script to verify that complex behavior is working as expected (for example, searching a website, then clicking one of the search results). The non-configurable timeout for this monitor is 180 seconds. API test: Create an API script to ensure your API endpoint is working correctly. For more information, see Write API tests. The non-configurable timeout for this monitor is 180 seconds. Monitor name Defines a name for the monitor. Monitor names cannot contain unencoded angle brackets (< >). To include angle brackets in a monitor name, encode them as HTML bracket entities (&lt; &gt;) in the UI or API. Location Select the locations where you want your monitor to run. Select more locations to ensure that your application is available to users around the world. If you have any private locations, they will be listed here too. You can use the Synthetics API location endpoint to retrieve a list of valid locations for your account. Your monitor will run one check from each selected location during each frequency interval. For example, if you select three locations and define a frequency of 15 minutes, your monitor will run three checks in each 15 minute period (or 8,640 checks per month). Frequency Select how often the monitor runs, in increments of minutes, hours, or 1 day. This frequency applies to each location. For example, if you select three locations and a Frequency of 15 minutes, your monitor will run three checks, on average every 5 minutes, in each 15 minute period (or 8,640 checks per month). Alerts Specify an email address to receive alerts when a monitor fails. Or, attach a monitor to an existing alert policy for more notification options. For more information, see Alerting for synthetic monitoring. Apdex T Customize the Apdex T for this monitor. This setting is only available when editing the settings for an existing monitor, not when creating a new monitor. Change the Apdex T from the default 7 seconds for more accurate Apdex scores in your SLA reports. For example, if you have a very long scripted browser, you might adjust the Apdex T to 15 seconds to more closely reflect the usual completion time. Similarly, a good Apdex T for a simple browser check might be only 2 seconds. Response Validation (optional) Specify text to search for on the page. When using simple browser or ping monitor types, there is a 1MB (10^6 bytes) limit on the page load. See a history of monitor changes You can use New Relic One to see a history of recent changes to synthetic monitors and what users changed them.",

Use the Synthetics REST API to manage monitors. Set up monitors from specific locations or for private servers. You can also use the host not reporting feature in infrastructure monitoring. This allows you to take advantage of enhanced monitoring options and be notified when New Relic has stopped receiving data from your hosts. Types of monitors These are the seven types of synthetic monitors: Type of synthetic monitor Description Broken links monitor API name: SCRIPT_API Provide a url and this monitor will test all the links on the page for success. If a failure is detected you can view the individual non-successful links that caused the failure. Certificate check monitor API name: SCRIPT_API Proactively ping your domain certificates based on a configurable threshold. Pair with an alert to ensure you are notified when your certificates need renewed. Ping monitor API name: SIMPLE Ping monitors are the simplest type of monitor. They simply check to see if an application is online. The synthetic ping monitor uses a simple Java HTTP client to make requests to your site. For consistency with other synthetic monitor types, the user agent is identified as Google Chrome. However, the HTTP client is not a full browser, and it does not execute JavaScript. If you need JavaScript functionality, use a simple browser monitor. Step monitor API name: STEP_MONITOR Step monitors are advanced monitors which require no code to set up. The monitor can be configured to: Assert modal Assert text Assert title Assert an element Click an element Dismiss a modal Double click an element Enter a secure credential Hover over an element Locate an element by CSS class, HTML ID, link text, Xpath, or value Navigate to a URL Select from a dropdown Type text Simple browser monitors API name: BROWSER Simple browser monitors essentially are simple, pre-built scripted browser monitors. They make a request to your site using an instance of Google Chrome. Compared to a simple ping monitor, this is a more accurate emulation of an actual customer visit. The user agent is identified as Google Chrome. Scripted browser monitors API name: SCRIPT_BROWSER Scripted browser monitors are used for more sophisticated, customized monitoring. You can create a custom script that navigates your website, takes specific actions, and ensures specific resources are present. The monitor uses Google Chrome browser. You can also use a variety of third-party modules to build your custom monitor. API tests API name: SCRIPT_API API tests are used to monitor your API endpoints. This can ensure that your app server works in addition to your website. New Relic uses the http-request module internally to make HTTP calls to your endpoint and validate the results. You can add and edit synthetic monitors directly in our UI. You can also create some synthetic monitors with Terraform. To learn how, watch this short YouTube video (approx. 3:25 minutes).",

Select the locations from which you want your monitor to run, and then click Save monitor to confirm. Generate some traffic and wait a few minutes, then check your monitor from the Monitors index. Add a broken links monitor Go to one.newrelic.com > Synthetics > Create monitor. Select the broken links check monitor type. Specify a name and enter the URL you'd like to monitor (may be any valid HTTP or HTTPS URL). Select the period to determine your monitor's frequency. Optional: Add tags to help you find this monitor later. Select the locations from which you want your monitor to run, and then click Save monitor to confirm. Generate some traffic and wait a few minutes, then check your monitor from the Monitors index. Tip You can also add monitors with the Synthetics REST API. For example, you can create a GET request to the monitor you want to use as the source for configuration, then use those key values to use in a POST to \"copy\" and create a new monitor. Edit a monitor You cannot change a monitor's type after the monitor is created, but you can edit other monitor settings. From the Monitors tab in one.newrelic.com > Synthetics, select the monitor you want to edit. In the side menu, select a link to change the following settings: Select Settings > General to edit name, Apdex T, URL, locations, frequency, and advanced options. For Scripted browser and API test monitors, select Settings > Script to edit your monitor script. For synthetic monitoring alerts, click Manage alerts. Select Save changes to confirm. Delete a monitor You must have Admin privileges in order to delete a monitor. To delete a monitor: From the Monitors tab in one.newrelic.com > Synthetics, select the monitor you want to edit. From the selected monitor, select Settings > General. Scroll to the bottom of the page and select the trash can icon. Tip You can also delete a monitor with the Synthetics REST API. Monitor settings When configuring monitors, the following settings are available: Type Select the type of monitor you want to create. A monitor's type can't be changed after the monitor is created. Ping: Specify a single URL to monitor for availability. New Relic will check this URL via HEAD or GET requests. The non-configurable timeout for this monitor is 60 seconds. Simple browser: Specify a single URL to monitor via real browser. Once each frequency interval, New Relic will check this URL via a Selenium-powered Google Chrome browser. The non-configurable timeout for this monitor is 60 seconds. Scripted browser: Create a script to drive a Selenium-powered Google Chrome browser. The browser follows each step in the script to verify that complex behavior is working as expected (for example, searching a website, then clicking one of the search results). The non-configurable timeout for this monitor is 180 seconds. API test: Create an API script to ensure your API endpoint is working correctly. For more information, see Write API tests. The non-configurable timeout for this monitor is 180 seconds. Monitor name Defines a name for the monitor. Monitor names cannot contain unencoded angle brackets (< >). To include angle brackets in a monitor name, encode them as HTML bracket entities (&lt; &gt;) in the UI or API. Location Select the locations where you want your monitor to run. Select more locations to ensure that your application is available to users around the world. If you have any private locations, they will be listed here too. You can use the Synthetics API location endpoint to retrieve a list of valid locations for your account. Your monitor will run one check from each selected location during each frequency interval. For example, if you select three locations and define a frequency of 15 minutes, your monitor will run three checks in each 15 minute period (or 8,640 checks per month). Frequency Select how often the monitor runs, in increments of minutes, hours, or 1 day. This frequency applies to each location. For example, if you select three locations and a Frequency of 15 minutes, your monitor will run three checks, on average every 5 minutes, in each 15 minute period (or 8,640 checks per month). Alerts Specify an email address to receive alerts when a monitor fails. Or, attach a monitor to an existing alert policy for more notification options. For more information, see Alerting for synthetic monitoring. Apdex T Customize the Apdex T for this monitor. This setting is only available when editing the settings for an existing monitor, not when creating a new monitor. Change the Apdex T from the default 7 seconds for more accurate Apdex scores in your SLA reports. For example, if you have a very long scripted browser, you might adjust the Apdex T to 15 seconds to more closely reflect the usual completion time. Similarly, a good Apdex T for a simple browser check might be only 2 seconds. Response Validation (optional) Specify text to search for on the page. When using simple browser or ping monitor types, there is a 1MB (10^6 bytes) limit on the page load.

They can also: Capture aggregate numbers, including an overview or summary for ping monitors. Provide detailed statistics for each page resource, and downtime incidents. Collect custom response codes for more detail on your monitor runs. You'll be able to add and configure synthetic monitors to suit your environnment after you create a New Relic account. (It's free, forever!) Add a monitor You can add several types of synthetic monitors: Ping monitors ensure your website is responding, while simple browser monitors send real browsers to check your website. For more complex monitoring, scripted browser monitors verify that specific resources are present, while API tests verify your API endpoint. The default timeout for a new monitor is 180 seconds. To learn how to use our step monitor to build complex workflow validation scripts without writing any code, watch this short YouTube video (approx. 3:20 minutes). Add a ping or simple browser monitor Go to one.newrelic.com > Synthetics > Create monitor. Specify a monitor type, name, and URL (may be any valid HTTP or HTTPS URL). Optional: Add a validation string or Advanced options: A validation string is available for ping and simple browser. This option enables substring monitoring for response validation. Verify SSL is available for ping and simple browser. This option verifies the validity of the SSL certificate chain. It can be duplicated by running the following syntax: openssl s_client -servername {YOUR_HOSTNAME} -connect {YOUR_HOSTNAME}:443 -CApath /etc/ssl/certs -verify_hostname {YOUR_HOSTNAME} > /dev/null Copy If a non-zero exit code is returned, the monitor will fail. The Bypass HEAD request option is available for ping. This option skips the default HEAD request and instead uses the GET verb with a ping check. Redirect is Failure is available for ping. If a redirect result occurs when Redirect is Failure is enabled, New Relic Synthetics will categorize the result as a failure, rather than following the redirect and checking the resulting URL.

      "body": "Synthetic monitors are API checks or virtual browser instances that monitor your website, recording each check in detail. They can also: Capture aggregate numbers, including an overview or summary for ping monitors. Provide detailed statistics for each page resource, and downtime incidents. Collect custom response codes for more detail on your monitor runs. You'll be able to add and configure synthetic monitors to suit your environnment after you create a New Relic account. (It's free, forever!) Add a monitor You can add several types of synthetic monitors: Ping monitors ensure your website is responding, while simple browser monitors send real browsers to check your website. For more complex monitoring, scripted browser monitors verify that specific resources are present, while API tests verify your API endpoint. The default timeout for a new monitor is 180 seconds. To learn how to use our step monitor to build complex workflow validation scripts without writing any code, watch this short YouTube video (approx. 3:20 minutes). Add a ping or simple browser monitor Go to one.newrelic.com > Synthetics > Create monitor. Specify a monitor type, name, and URL (may be any valid HTTP or HTTPS URL). Optional: Add a validation string or Advanced options: A validation string is available for ping and simple browser. This option enables substring monitoring for response validation. Verify SSL is available for ping and simple browser. This option verifies the validity of the SSL certificate chain. It can be duplicated by running the following syntax: openssl s_client -servername {YOUR_HOSTNAME} -connect {YOUR_HOSTNAME}:443 -CApath /etc/ssl/certs -verify_hostname {YOUR_HOSTNAME} > /dev/null Copy If a non-zero exit code is returned, the monitor will fail. The Bypass HEAD request option is available for ping. This option skips the default HEAD request and instead uses the GET verb with a ping check. Redirect is Failure is available for ping. If a redirect result occurs when Redirect is Failure is enabled, New Relic Synthetics will categorize the result as a failure, rather than following the redirect and checking the resulting URL. Select the locations from which you want your monitor to run. Choose a frequency to determine how often each location will run your monitor. Optional: Set up alert notifications. Select Create my monitor to confirm. Generate some traffic and wait a few minutes, then check your monitor from the Monitors index. Add a scripted browser or API test monitor Go to one.newrelic.com > Synthetics > Create monitor. Specify a monitor type and name. Select the locations from which you want your monitor to run. Choose a frequency to determine how often each location will run your monitor. Optional: Set up alert notifications. Select Next: Write your script to create a script for your scripted browser or API test, then select Validate to verify your syntax. Tip For complex scripts, validation may take up to one minute. Select Create my monitor to confirm. Generate some traffic and wait a few minutes, then check your monitor from the Monitors index. Add a step monitor Go to one.newrelic.com > Synthetics > Create monitor. Select step monitor as the monitor type. Specify a name and choose a frequency to determine how often each location will run your monitor. Select the locations from which you want your monitor to run. Build your monitor by selecting from the preconfigured steps at the bottom of the UI: Navigate to a URL Type text Click an element Assert text Assert an element Secure a credential Use the instructions on the right side of the UI to help locate elements by CSS class, HTML ID, link text, or XPath. Select Save monitor to confirm. Generate some traffic and wait a few minutes, then check your monitor from the Monitors index. Add a certificate check monitor Go to one.newrelic.com > Synthetics > Create monitor. Select the certificate check monitor type. Specify a name and enter the domain you'd like to monitor. Enter the number of days it takes for your certificate to expire. Select the period to determine your monitor's frequency. Optional: Add tags to help you find this monitor later. Select the locations from which you want your monitor to run, and then click Save monitor to confirm. Generate some traffic and wait a few minutes, then check your monitor from the Monitors index. Add a broken links monitor Go to one.newrelic.com > Synthetics > Create monitor. Select the broken links check monitor type. Specify a name and enter the URL you'd like to monitor (may be any valid HTTP or HTTPS URL). Select the period to determine your monitor's frequency. Optional: Add tags to help you find this monitor later. Select the locations from which you want your monitor to run, and then click Save monitor to confirm. Generate some traffic and wait a few minutes, then check your monitor from the Monitors index. Tip You can also add monitors with the Synthetics REST API. For example, you can create a GET request to the monitor you want to use as the source for configuration, then use those key values to use in a POST to \"copy\" and create a new monitor. Edit a monitor You cannot change a monitor's type after the monitor is created, but you can edit other monitor settings. From the Monitors tab in one.newrelic.com > Synthetics, select the monitor you want to edit. In the side menu, select a link to change the following settings: Select Settings > General to edit name, Apdex T, URL, locations, frequency, and advanced options. For Scripted browser and API test monitors, select Settings > Script to edit your monitor script. For synthetic monitoring alerts, click Manage alerts. Select Save changes to confirm. Delete a monitor You must have Admin privileges in order to delete a monitor. To delete a monitor: From the Monitors tab in one.newrelic.com > Synthetics, select the monitor you want to edit. From the selected monitor, select Settings > General. Scroll to the bottom of the page and select the trash can icon. Tip You can also delete a monitor with the Synthetics REST API. Monitor settings When configuring monitors, the following settings are available: Type Select the type of monitor you want to create. A monitor's type can't be changed after the monitor is created. Ping: Specify a single URL to monitor for availability. New Relic will check this URL via HEAD or GET requests. The non-configurable timeout for this monitor is 60 seconds. Simple browser: Specify a single URL to monitor via real browser. Once each frequency interval, New Relic will check this URL via a Selenium-powered Google Chrome browser. The non-configurable timeout for this monitor is 60 seconds. Scripted browser: Create a script to drive a Selenium-powered Google Chrome browser. The browser follows each step in the script to verify that complex behavior is working as expected (for example, searching a website, then clicking one of the search results). The non-configurable timeout for this monitor is 180 seconds. API test: Create an API script to ensure your API endpoint is working correctly. For more information, see Write API tests. The non-configurable timeout for this monitor is 180 seconds. Monitor name Defines a name for the monitor. Monitor names cannot contain unencoded angle brackets (< >). To include angle brackets in a monitor name, encode them as HTML bracket entities (&lt; &gt;) in the UI or API. Location Select the locations where you want your monitor to run. Select more locations to ensure that your application is available to users around the world. If you have any private locations, they will be listed here too. You can use the Synthetics API location endpoint to retrieve a list of valid locations for your account. Your monitor will run one check from each selected location during each frequency interval. For example, if you select three locations and define a frequency of 15 minutes, your monitor will run three checks in each 15 minute period (or 8,640 checks per month). Frequency Select how often the monitor runs, in increments of minutes, hours, or 1 day. This frequency applies to each location. For example, if you select three locations and a Frequency of 15 minutes, your monitor will run three checks, on average every 5 minutes, in each 15 minute period (or 8,640 checks per month). Alerts Specify an email address to receive alerts when a monitor fails. Or, attach a monitor to an existing alert policy for more notification options. For more information, see Alerting for synthetic monitoring. Apdex T Customize the Apdex T for this monitor. This setting is only available when editing the settings for an existing monitor, not when creating a new monitor. Change the Apdex T from the default 7 seconds for more accurate Apdex scores in your SLA reports. For example, if you have a very long scripted browser, you might adjust the Apdex T to 15 seconds to more closely reflect the usual completion time. Similarly, a good Apdex T for a simple browser check might be only 2 seconds. Response Validation (optional) Specify text to search for on the page. When using simple browser or ping monitor types, there is a 1MB (10^6 bytes) limit on the page load. See a history of monitor changes You can use New Relic One to see a history of recent changes to synthetic monitors and what users changed them.",

This allows you to take advantage of enhanced monitoring options and be notified when New Relic has stopped receiving data from your hosts. Types of monitors These are the seven types of synthetic monitors: Type of synthetic monitor Description Broken links monitor API name: SCRIPT_API Provide a url and this monitor will test all the links on the page for success. If a failure is detected you can view the individual non-successful links that caused the failure. Certificate check monitor API name: SCRIPT_API Proactively ping your domain certificates based on a configurable threshold. Pair with an alert to ensure you are notified when your certificates need renewed. Ping monitor API name: SIMPLE Ping monitors are the simplest type of monitor. They simply check to see if an application is online. The synthetic ping monitor uses a simple Java HTTP client to make requests to your site. For consistency with other synthetic monitor types, the user agent is identified as Google Chrome. However, the HTTP client is not a full browser, and it does not execute JavaScript. If you need JavaScript functionality, use a simple browser monitor. Step monitor API name: STEP_MONITOR Step monitors are advanced monitors which require no code to set up. The monitor can be configured to: Assert modal Assert text Assert title Assert an element Click an element Dismiss a modal Double click an element Enter a secure credential Hover over an element Locate an element by CSS class, HTML ID, link text, Xpath, or value Navigate to a URL Select from a dropdown Type text Simple browser monitors API name: BROWSER Simple browser monitors essentially are simple, pre-built scripted browser monitors. They make a request to your site using an instance of Google Chrome. Compared to a simple ping monitor, this is a more accurate emulation of an actual customer visit. The user agent is identified as Google Chrome. Scripted browser monitors API name: SCRIPT_BROWSER Scripted browser monitors are used for more sophisticated, customized monitoring. You can create a custom script that navigates your website, takes specific actions, and ensures specific resources are present. The monitor uses Google Chrome browser. You can also use a variety of third-party modules to build your custom monitor. API tests API name: SCRIPT_API API tests are used to monitor your API endpoints. This can ensure that your app server works in addition to your website. New Relic uses the http-request module internally to make HTTP calls to your endpoint and validate the results. You can add and edit synthetic monitors directly in our UI. You can also create some synthetic monitors with Terraform. To learn how, watch this short YouTube video (approx. 3:25 minutes).",

      "body": "You can use secure credentials with synthetic monitoring to store critical information, such as passwords, API keys, usernames, etc. This prevents scripted monitor users from viewing, updating, or deleting these values unless they have explicit permissions in New Relic. You can set secure credentials in New Relic One or with the API. The credentials are securely stored using AES-GCM 256-bit encryption at rest with keys managed by Amazon AWS Key Management Service (KMS). To learn how to secure sensitive information in your synthetic monitoring workflows, watch this short video (3:15 minutes): Requirements and limits Before using secure credentials, review these requirements and guidelines: Secure credentials Comments Applicable monitors The secure credentials feature is available only for synthetic scripted browsers and API test monitors. Permissions Account administrators can control which users can create, view, or delete secure credentials by managing users' permissions. Limit You can have a maximum of 1,000 secure credentials. Add or update secure credentials You can add or update secure credentials using the UI or the Synthetics REST API. To add, view, edit, or delete a secure credential for a scripted browser or API test monitor from the UI: Go to one.newrelic.com > Synthetics > Secure credentials. To add a new secure credential, look for the Create secure credential + button. If you have credentials already added, this button is at the top right. Tips for creating the Key: choose a username or other meaningful key name to identify the secure credential. Use alphanumeric or underscore _ characters. Key names must be UPPERCASE. Tips for creating the Value: Use any combination of alphanumeric or special characters. 10000 characters maximum. This field is not accessible via the API. To edit an existing credential, click the ellipsis icon for options. Associate the secure credential with a scripted browser or API test by editing the script. After you add the secure credential to the script, the Secure credentials UI shows how many scripted monitors use that credential. This number is approximate and only updates after a monitor with a secure credential has actually been run. Update the script When using the Synthetics UI editor to create scripted browsers or API test monitors, follow these guidelines: Script Guidelines Format Anywhere in the script where you reference the secure credential, it is accessed via the reserved New Relic $secure JavaScript object with dot notation. For example, $secure.MY_SECURE_CREDENTIAL. Properties on $secure are not accessible through bracket notation. Existing credentials To view or select from a list of available secure credentials: Type $secure. OR Select from the dropdown in the editor UI. Validation To validate the secure credential, follow standard procedures to test the script or write an API test. Any changes to the secure credential's value will automatically take effect across all monitors that use it. You do not need to also update the script. Exception: If you update the script and jobs are already processing, the secure credential change will not take effect until the next time the job begins. Security for secure credentials To ensure the security of your secure credentials, New Relic scrubs the secure value out of all data that goes to results in synthetic monitoring data and alerts. New Relic employees cannot access secure credential values and must be added to the account to be able to view secure credentials. Example A secure credential is named PASSWORD and the value is Pass123!. New Relic replaces Pass123! with _SECURECREDENTIAL_ For example, a script includes: $browser.get(\"https://example.com/\" + $secure.PASSWORD) Copy The script results will show that New Relic Synthetics went to https://example.com/_SECURECREDENTIAL_, even though it actually went to https://example.com/Pass123!. This ensures the value of the secure credential will not appear in the results. Redacted information We currently redact the following from the results of your monitor: The exact values of your secure credentials Any percent-encoded values of your secure credentials",

Collect custom response codes for more detail on your monitor runs. You'll be able to add and configure synthetic monitors to suit your environnment after you create a New Relic account. (It's free, forever!) Add a monitor You can add several types of synthetic monitors: Ping monitors ensure your website is responding, while simple browser monitors send real browsers to check your website. For more complex monitoring, scripted browser monitors verify that specific resources are present, while API tests verify your API endpoint. The default timeout for a new monitor is 180 seconds. To learn how to use our step monitor to build complex workflow validation scripts without writing any code, watch this short YouTube video (approx. 3:20 minutes). Add a ping or simple browser monitor Go to one.newrelic.com > Synthetics > Create monitor. Specify a monitor type, name, and URL (may be any valid HTTP or HTTPS URL). Optional: Add a validation string or Advanced options: A validation string is available for ping and simple browser. This option enables substring monitoring for response validation. Verify SSL is available for ping and simple browser. This option verifies the validity of the SSL certificate chain. It can be duplicated by running the following syntax: openssl s_client -servername {YOUR_HOSTNAME} -connect {YOUR_HOSTNAME}:443 -CApath /etc/ssl/certs -verify_hostname {YOUR_HOSTNAME} > /dev/null Copy If a non-zero exit code is returned, the monitor will fail. The Bypass HEAD request option is available for ping. This option skips the default HEAD request and instead uses the GET verb with a ping check. Redirect is Failure is available for ping. If a redirect result occurs when Redirect is Failure is enabled, New Relic Synthetics will categorize the result as a failure, rather than following the redirect and checking the resulting URL. Select the locations from which you want your monitor to run. Choose a frequency to determine how often each location will run your monitor. Optional: Set up alert notifications. Select Create my monitor to confirm. Generate some traffic and wait a few minutes, then check your monitor from the Monitors index.

Choose a frequency to determine how often each location will run your monitor. Optional: Set up alert notifications. Select Next: Write your script to create a script for your scripted browser or API test, then select Validate to verify your syntax. Tip For complex scripts, validation may take up to one minute. Select Create my monitor to confirm. Generate some traffic and wait a few minutes, then check your monitor from the Monitors index. Add a step monitor Go to one.newrelic.com > Synthetics > Create monitor. Select step monitor as the monitor type. Specify a name and choose a frequency to determine how often each location will run your monitor. Select the locations from which you want your monitor to run. Build your monitor by selecting from the preconfigured steps at the bottom of the UI: Navigate to a URL Type text Click an element Assert text Assert an element Secure a credential Use the instructions on the right side of the UI to help locate elements by CSS class, HTML ID, link text, or XPath. Select Save monitor to confirm. Generate some traffic and wait a few minutes, then check your monitor from the Monitors index. Add a certificate check monitor Go to one.newrelic.com > Synthetics > Create monitor. Select the certificate check monitor type. Specify a name and enter the domain you'd like to monitor. Enter the number of days it takes for your certificate to expire. Select the period to determine your monitor's frequency. Optional: Add tags to help you find this monitor later. Select the locations from which you want your monitor to run, and then click Save monitor to confirm. Generate some traffic and wait a few minutes, then check your monitor from the Monitors index. Add a broken links monitor Go to one.newrelic.com > Synthetics > Create monitor. Select the broken links check monitor type. Specify a name and enter the URL you'd like to monitor (may be any valid HTTP or HTTPS URL). Select the period to determine your monitor's frequency. Optional: Add tags to help you find this monitor later. Select the locations from which you want your monitor to run, and then click Save monitor to confirm. Generate some traffic and wait a few minutes, then check your monitor from the Monitors index. Tip You can also add monitors with the Synthetics REST API. For example, you can create a GET request to the monitor you want to use as the source for configuration, then use those key values to use in a POST to \"copy\" and create a new monitor. Edit a monitor You cannot change a monitor's type after the monitor is created, but you can edit other monitor settings. From the Monitors tab in one.newrelic.com > Synthetics, select the monitor you want to edit. In the side menu, select a link to change the following settings: Select Settings > General to edit name, Apdex T, URL, locations, frequency, and advanced options. For Scripted browser and API test monitors, select Settings > Script to edit your monitor script. For synthetic monitoring alerts, click Manage alerts. Select Save changes to confirm. Delete a monitor You must have Admin privileges in order to delete a monitor. To delete a monitor: From the Monitors tab in one.newrelic.com > Synthetics, select the monitor you want to edit. From the selected monitor, select Settings > General. Scroll to the bottom of the page and select the trash can icon. Tip You can also delete a monitor with the Synthetics REST API. Monitor settings When configuring monitors, the following settings are available: Type Select the type of monitor you want to create. A monitor's type can't be changed after the monitor is created. Ping: Specify a single URL to monitor for availability. New Relic will check this URL via HEAD or GET requests. The non-configurable timeout for this monitor is 60 seconds. Simple browser: Specify a single URL to monitor via real browser. Once each frequency interval, New Relic will check this URL via a Selenium-powered Google Chrome browser. The non-configurable timeout for this monitor is 60 seconds. Scripted browser: Create a script to drive a Selenium-powered Google Chrome browser. The browser follows each step in the script to verify that complex behavior is working as expected (for example, searching a website, then clicking one of the search results). The non-configurable timeout for this monitor is 180 seconds. API test: Create an API script to ensure your API endpoint is working correctly. For more information, see Write API tests. The non-configurable timeout for this monitor is 180 seconds. Monitor name Defines a name for the monitor. Monitor names cannot contain unencoded angle brackets (< >). To include angle brackets in a monitor name, encode them as HTML bracket entities (&lt; &gt;) in the UI or API. Location Select the locations where you want your monitor to run. Select more locations to ensure that your application is available to users around the world. If you have any private locations, they will be listed here too. You can use the Synthetics API location endpoint to retrieve a list of valid locations for your account. Your monitor will run one check from each selected location during each frequency interval. For example, if you select three locations and define a frequency of 15 minutes, your monitor will run three checks in each 15 minute period (or 8,640 checks per month). Frequency Select how often the monitor runs, in increments of minutes, hours, or 1 day. This frequency applies to each location. For example, if you select three locations and a Frequency of 15 minutes, your monitor will run three checks, on average every 5 minutes, in each 15 minute period (or 8,640 checks per month). Alerts Specify an email address to receive alerts when a monitor fails. Or, attach a monitor to an existing alert policy for more notification options. For more information, see Alerting for synthetic monitoring. Apdex T Customize the Apdex T for this monitor. This setting is only available when editing the settings for an existing monitor, not when creating a new monitor. Change the Apdex T from the default 7 seconds for more accurate Apdex scores in your SLA reports. For example, if you have a very long scripted browser, you might adjust the Apdex T to 15 seconds to more closely reflect the usual completion time. Similarly, a good Apdex T for a simple browser check might be only 2 seconds. Response Validation (optional) Specify text to search for on the page.

Use the Synthetics REST API to manage monitors. Set up monitors from specific locations or for private servers. You can also use the host not reporting feature in infrastructure monitoring. This allows you to take advantage of enhanced monitoring options and be notified when New Relic has stopped receiving data from your hosts. Types of monitors These are the seven types of synthetic monitors: Type of synthetic monitor Description Broken links monitor API name: SCRIPT_API Provide a url and this monitor will test all the links on the page for success. If a failure is detected you can view the individual non-successful links that caused the failure. Certificate check monitor API name: SCRIPT_API Proactively ping your domain certificates based on a configurable threshold. Pair with an alert to ensure you are notified when your certificates need renewed. Ping monitor API name: SIMPLE Ping monitors are the simplest type of monitor. They simply check to see if an application is online. The synthetic ping monitor uses a simple Java HTTP client to make requests to your site. For consistency with other synthetic monitor types, the user agent is identified as Google Chrome. However, the HTTP client is not a full browser, and it does not execute JavaScript. If you need JavaScript functionality, use a simple browser monitor. Step monitor API name: STEP_MONITOR Step monitors are advanced monitors which require no code to set up. The monitor can be configured to: Assert modal Assert text Assert title Assert an element Click an element Dismiss a modal Double click an element Enter a secure credential Hover over an element Locate an element by CSS class, HTML ID, link text, Xpath, or value Navigate to a URL Select from a dropdown Type text Simple browser monitors API name: BROWSER Simple browser monitors essentially are simple, pre-built scripted browser monitors. They make a request to your site using an instance of Google Chrome. Compared to a simple ping monitor, this is a more accurate emulation of an actual customer visit. The user agent is identified as Google Chrome. Scripted browser monitors API name: SCRIPT_BROWSER Scripted browser monitors are used for more sophisticated, customized monitoring. You can create a custom script that navigates your website, takes specific actions, and ensures specific resources are present. The monitor uses Google Chrome browser. You can also use a variety of third-party modules to build your custom monitor. API tests API name: SCRIPT_API API tests are used to monitor your API endpoints. This can ensure that your app server works in addition to your website. New Relic uses the http-request module internally to make HTTP calls to your endpoint and validate the results. You can add and edit synthetic monitors directly in our UI. You can also create some synthetic monitors with Terraform. To learn how, watch this short YouTube video (approx. 3:25 minutes).",

Optional: Add tags to help you find this monitor later. Select the locations from which you want your monitor to run, and then click Save monitor to confirm. Generate some traffic and wait a few minutes, then check your monitor from the Monitors index. Tip You can also add monitors with the Synthetics REST API. For example, you can create a GET request to the monitor you want to use as the source for configuration, then use those key values to use in a POST to \"copy\" and create a new monitor. Edit a monitor You cannot change a monitor's type after the monitor is created, but you can edit other monitor settings. From the Monitors tab in one.newrelic.com > Synthetics, select the monitor you want to edit. In the side menu, select a link to change the following settings: Select Settings > General to edit name, Apdex T, URL, locations, frequency, and advanced options. For Scripted browser and API test monitors, select Settings > Script to edit your monitor script. For synthetic monitoring alerts, click Manage alerts. Select Save changes to confirm. Delete a monitor You must have Admin privileges in order to delete a monitor. To delete a monitor: From the Monitors tab in one.newrelic.com > Synthetics, select the monitor you want to edit. From the selected monitor, select Settings > General. Scroll to the bottom of the page and select the trash can icon. Tip You can also delete a monitor with the Synthetics REST API. Monitor settings When configuring monitors, the following settings are available: Type Select the type of monitor you want to create. A monitor's type can't be changed after the monitor is created. Ping: Specify a single URL to monitor for availability. New Relic will check this URL via HEAD or GET requests. The non-configurable timeout for this monitor is 60 seconds. Simple browser: Specify a single URL to monitor via real browser. Once each frequency interval, New Relic will check this URL via a Selenium-powered Google Chrome browser. The non-configurable timeout for this monitor is 60 seconds. Scripted browser: Create a script to drive a Selenium-powered Google Chrome browser. The browser follows each step in the script to verify that complex behavior is working as expected (for example, searching a website, then clicking one of the search results). The non-configurable timeout for this monitor is 180 seconds. API test: Create an API script to ensure your API endpoint is working correctly. For more information, see Write API tests. The non-configurable timeout for this monitor is 180 seconds. Monitor name Defines a name for the monitor. Monitor names cannot contain unencoded angle brackets (< >). To include angle brackets in a monitor name, encode them as HTML bracket entities (&lt; &gt;) in the UI or API. Location Select the locations where you want your monitor to run. Select more locations to ensure that your application is available to users around the world. If you have any private locations, they will be listed here too. You can use the Synthetics API location endpoint to retrieve a list of valid locations for your account. Your monitor will run one check from each selected location during each frequency interval. For example, if you select three locations and define a frequency of 15 minutes, your monitor will run three checks in each 15 minute period (or 8,640 checks per month). Frequency Select how often the monitor runs, in increments of minutes, hours, or 1 day. This frequency applies to each location. For example, if you select three locations and a Frequency of 15 minutes, your monitor will run three checks, on average every 5 minutes, in each 15 minute period (or 8,640 checks per month). Alerts Specify an email address to receive alerts when a monitor fails. Or, attach a monitor to an existing alert policy for more notification options. For more information, see Alerting for synthetic monitoring. Apdex T Customize the Apdex T for this monitor. This setting is only available when editing the settings for an existing monitor, not when creating a new monitor. Change the Apdex T from the default 7 seconds for more accurate Apdex scores in your SLA reports. For example, if you have a very long scripted browser, you might adjust the Apdex T to 15 seconds to more closely reflect the usual completion time. Similarly, a good Apdex T for a simple browser check might be only 2 seconds. Response Validation (optional) Specify text to search for on the page.

      "body": "You can proactively monitor your website or API endpoints with synthetic monitors. Depending on the type of monitor, you can: Add and edit monitors. Use the Synthetics REST API to manage monitors. Set up monitors from specific locations or for private servers. You can also use the host not reporting feature in infrastructure monitoring. This allows you to take advantage of enhanced monitoring options and be notified when New Relic has stopped receiving data from your hosts. Types of monitors These are the seven types of synthetic monitors: Type of synthetic monitor Description Broken links monitor API name: SCRIPT_API Provide a url and this monitor will test all the links on the page for success. If a failure is detected you can view the individual non-successful links that caused the failure. Certificate check monitor API name: SCRIPT_API Proactively ping your domain certificates based on a configurable threshold. Pair with an alert to ensure you are notified when your certificates need renewed. Ping monitor API name: SIMPLE Ping monitors are the simplest type of monitor. They simply check to see if an application is online. The synthetic ping monitor uses a simple Java HTTP client to make requests to your site. For consistency with other synthetic monitor types, the user agent is identified as Google Chrome. However, the HTTP client is not a full browser, and it does not execute JavaScript. If you need JavaScript functionality, use a simple browser monitor. Step monitor API name: STEP_MONITOR Step monitors are advanced monitors which require no code to set up. The monitor can be configured to: Assert modal Assert text Assert title Assert an element Click an element Dismiss a modal Double click an element Enter a secure credential Hover over an element Locate an element by CSS class, HTML ID, link text, Xpath, or value Navigate to a URL Select from a dropdown Type text Simple browser monitors API name: BROWSER Simple browser monitors essentially are simple, pre-built scripted browser monitors. They make a request to your site using an instance of Google Chrome. Compared to a simple ping monitor, this is a more accurate emulation of an actual customer visit. The user agent is identified as Google Chrome. Scripted browser monitors API name: SCRIPT_BROWSER Scripted browser monitors are used for more sophisticated, customized monitoring. You can create a custom script that navigates your website, takes specific actions, and ensures specific resources are present. The monitor uses Google Chrome browser. You can also use a variety of third-party modules to build your custom monitor. API tests API name: SCRIPT_API API tests are used to monitor your API endpoints. This can ensure that your app server works in addition to your website. New Relic uses the http-request module internally to make HTTP calls to your endpoint and validate the results. You can add and edit synthetic monitors directly in our UI. You can also create some synthetic monitors with Terraform. To learn how, watch this short YouTube video (approx. 3:25 minutes).",

Use the Synthetics REST API to manage monitors. Set up monitors from specific locations or for private servers. You can also use the host not reporting feature in infrastructure monitoring. This allows you to take advantage of enhanced monitoring options and be notified when New Relic has stopped receiving data from your hosts. Types of monitors These are the seven types of synthetic monitors: Type of synthetic monitor Description Broken links monitor API name: SCRIPT_API Provide a url and this monitor will test all the links on the page for success. If a failure is detected you can view the individual non-successful links that caused the failure. Certificate check monitor API name: SCRIPT_API Proactively ping your domain certificates based on a configurable threshold. Pair with an alert to ensure you are notified when your certificates need renewed. Ping monitor API name: SIMPLE Ping monitors are the simplest type of monitor. They simply check to see if an application is online. The synthetic ping monitor uses a simple Java HTTP client to make requests to your site. For consistency with other synthetic monitor types, the user agent is identified as Google Chrome. However, the HTTP client is not a full browser, and it does not execute JavaScript. If you need JavaScript functionality, use a simple browser monitor. Step monitor API name: STEP_MONITOR Step monitors are advanced monitors which require no code to set up. The monitor can be configured to: Assert modal Assert text Assert title Assert an element Click an element Dismiss a modal Double click an element Enter a secure credential Hover over an element Locate an element by CSS class, HTML ID, link text, Xpath, or value Navigate to a URL Select from a dropdown Type text Simple browser monitors API name: BROWSER Simple browser monitors essentially are simple, pre-built scripted browser monitors. They make a request to your site using an instance of Google Chrome. Compared to a simple ping monitor, this is a more accurate emulation of an actual customer visit. The user agent is identified as Google Chrome. Scripted browser monitors API name: SCRIPT_BROWSER Scripted browser monitors are used for more sophisticated, customized monitoring. You can create a custom script that navigates your website, takes specific actions, and ensures specific resources are present. The monitor uses Google Chrome browser. You can also use a variety of third-party modules to build your custom monitor. API tests API name: SCRIPT_API API tests are used to monitor your API endpoints. This can ensure that your app server works in addition to your website. New Relic uses the http-request module internally to make HTTP calls to your endpoint and validate the results.

Collect custom response codes for more detail on your monitor runs. You'll be able to add and configure synthetic monitors to suit your environnment after you create a New Relic account. (It's free, forever!) Add a monitor You can add several types of synthetic monitors: Ping monitors ensure your website is responding, while simple browser monitors send real browsers to check your website. For more complex monitoring, scripted browser monitors verify that specific resources are present, while API tests verify your API endpoint. The default timeout for a new monitor is 180 seconds. To learn how to use our step monitor to build complex workflow validation scripts without writing any code, watch this short YouTube video (approx. 3:20 minutes). Add a ping or simple browser monitor Go to one.newrelic.com > Synthetics > Create monitor. Specify a monitor type, name, and URL (may be any valid HTTP or HTTPS URL). Optional: Add a validation string or Advanced options: A validation string is available for ping and simple browser. This option enables substring monitoring for response validation. Verify SSL is available for ping and simple browser. This option verifies the validity of the SSL certificate chain. It can be duplicated by running the following syntax: openssl s_client -servername {YOUR_HOSTNAME} -connect {YOUR_HOSTNAME}:443 -CApath /etc/ssl/certs -verify_hostname {YOUR_HOSTNAME} > /dev/null Copy If a non-zero exit code is returned, the monitor will fail. The Bypass HEAD request option is available for ping. This option skips the default HEAD request and instead uses the GET verb with a ping check. Redirect is Failure is available for ping. If a redirect result occurs when Redirect is Failure is enabled, New Relic Synthetics will categorize the result as a failure, rather than following the redirect and checking the resulting URL. Select the locations from which you want your monitor to run. Choose a frequency to determine how often each location will run your monitor. Optional: Set up alert notifications. Select Create my monitor to confirm. Generate some traffic and wait a few minutes, then check your monitor from the Monitors index. Add a scripted browser or API test monitor Go to one.newrelic.com > Synthetics > Create monitor. Specify a monitor type and name. Select the locations from which you want your monitor to run. Choose a frequency to determine how often each location will run your monitor. Optional: Set up alert notifications. Select Next: Write your script to create a script for your scripted browser or API test, then select Validate to verify your syntax. Tip For complex scripts, validation may take up to one minute. Select Create my monitor to confirm. Generate some traffic and wait a few minutes, then check your monitor from the Monitors index. Add a step monitor Go to one.newrelic.com > Synthetics > Create monitor. Select step monitor as the monitor type. Specify a name and choose a frequency to determine how often each location will run your monitor. Select the locations from which you want your monitor to run. Build your monitor by selecting from the preconfigured steps at the bottom of the UI: Navigate to a URL Type text Click an element Assert text Assert an element Secure a credential Use the instructions on the right side of the UI to help locate elements by CSS class, HTML ID, link text, or XPath. Select Save monitor to confirm. Generate some traffic and wait a few minutes, then check your monitor from the Monitors index. Add a certificate check monitor Go to one.newrelic.com > Synthetics > Create monitor. Select the certificate check monitor type. Specify a name and enter the domain you'd like to monitor. Enter the number of days it takes for your certificate to expire. Select the period to determine your monitor's frequency. Optional: Add tags to help you find this monitor later. Select the locations from which you want your monitor to run, and then click Save monitor to confirm. Generate some traffic and wait a few minutes, then check your monitor from the Monitors index. Add a broken links monitor Go to one.newrelic.com > Synthetics > Create monitor. Select the broken links check monitor type. Specify a name and enter the URL you'd like to monitor (may be any valid HTTP or HTTPS URL). Select the period to determine your monitor's frequency. Optional: Add tags to help you find this monitor later. Select the locations from which you want your monitor to run, and then click Save monitor to confirm. Generate some traffic and wait a few minutes, then check your monitor from the Monitors index. Tip You can also add monitors with the Synthetics REST API. For example, you can create a GET request to the monitor you want to use as the source for configuration, then use those key values to use in a POST to \"copy\" and create a new monitor. Edit a monitor You cannot change a monitor's type after the monitor is created, but you can edit other monitor settings. From the Monitors tab in one.newrelic.com > Synthetics, select the monitor you want to edit. In the side menu, select a link to change the following settings: Select Settings > General to edit name, Apdex T, URL, locations, frequency, and advanced options. For Scripted browser and API test monitors, select Settings > Script to edit your monitor script. For synthetic monitoring alerts, click Manage alerts. Select Save changes to confirm. Delete a monitor You must have Admin privileges in order to delete a monitor. To delete a monitor: From the Monitors tab in one.newrelic.com > Synthetics, select the monitor you want to edit. From the selected monitor, select Settings > General. Scroll to the bottom of the page and select the trash can icon. Tip You can also delete a monitor with the Synthetics REST API. Monitor settings When configuring monitors, the following settings are available: Type Select the type of monitor you want to create. A monitor's type can't be changed after the monitor is created. Ping: Specify a single URL to monitor for availability. New Relic will check this URL via HEAD or GET requests. The non-configurable timeout for this monitor is 60 seconds. Simple browser: Specify a single URL to monitor via real browser. Once each frequency interval, New Relic will check this URL via a Selenium-powered Google Chrome browser. The non-configurable timeout for this monitor is 60 seconds. Scripted browser: Create a script to drive a Selenium-powered Google Chrome browser. The browser follows each step in the script to verify that complex behavior is working as expected (for example, searching a website, then clicking one of the search results). The non-configurable timeout for this monitor is 180 seconds. API test: Create an API script to ensure your API endpoint is working correctly. For more information, see Write API tests. The non-configurable timeout for this monitor is 180 seconds. Monitor name Defines a name for the monitor. Monitor names cannot contain unencoded angle brackets (< >). To include angle brackets in a monitor name, encode them as HTML bracket entities (&lt; &gt;) in the UI or API. Location Select the locations where you want your monitor to run. Select more locations to ensure that your application is available to users around the world. If you have any private locations, they will be listed here too. You can use the Synthetics API location endpoint to retrieve a list of valid locations for your account. Your monitor will run one check from each selected location during each frequency interval. For example, if you select three locations and define a frequency of 15 minutes, your monitor will run three checks in each 15 minute period (or 8,640 checks per month). Frequency Select how often the monitor runs, in increments of minutes, hours, or 1 day. This frequency applies to each location. For example, if you select three locations and a Frequency of 15 minutes, your monitor will run three checks, on average every 5 minutes, in each 15 minute period (or 8,640 checks per month). Alerts Specify an email address to receive alerts when a monitor fails. Or, attach a monitor to an existing alert policy for more notification options. For more information, see Alerting for synthetic monitoring. Apdex T Customize the Apdex T for this monitor. This setting is only available when editing the settings for an existing monitor, not when creating a new monitor. Change the Apdex T from the default 7 seconds for more accurate Apdex scores in your SLA reports. For example, if you have a very long scripted browser, you might adjust the Apdex T to 15 seconds to more closely reflect the usual completion time. Similarly, a good Apdex T for a simple browser check might be only 2 seconds. Response Validation (optional) Specify text to search for on the page. When using simple browser or ping monitor types, there is a 1MB (10^6 bytes) limit on the page load.

Optional: Add tags to help you find this monitor later. Select the locations from which you want your monitor to run, and then click Save monitor to confirm. Generate some traffic and wait a few minutes, then check your monitor from the Monitors index. Tip You can also add monitors with the Synthetics REST API. For example, you can create a GET request to the monitor you want to use as the source for configuration, then use those key values to use in a POST to \"copy\" and create a new monitor. Edit a monitor You cannot change a monitor's type after the monitor is created, but you can edit other monitor settings. From the Monitors tab in one.newrelic.com > Synthetics, select the monitor you want to edit. In the side menu, select a link to change the following settings: Select Settings > General to edit name, Apdex T, URL, locations, frequency, and advanced options. For Scripted browser and API test monitors, select Settings > Script to edit your monitor script. For synthetic monitoring alerts, click Manage alerts. Select Save changes to confirm. Delete a monitor You must have Admin privileges in order to delete a monitor. To delete a monitor: From the Monitors tab in one.newrelic.com > Synthetics, select the monitor you want to edit. From the selected monitor, select Settings > General. Scroll to the bottom of the page and select the trash can icon. Tip You can also delete a monitor with the Synthetics REST API. Monitor settings When configuring monitors, the following settings are available: Type Select the type of monitor you want to create. A monitor's type can't be changed after the monitor is created. Ping: Specify a single URL to monitor for availability. New Relic will check this URL via HEAD or GET requests. The non-configurable timeout for this monitor is 60 seconds. Simple browser: Specify a single URL to monitor via real browser. Once each frequency interval, New Relic will check this URL via a Selenium-powered Google Chrome browser. The non-configurable timeout for this monitor is 60 seconds. Scripted browser: Create a script to drive a Selenium-powered Google Chrome browser. The browser follows each step in the script to verify that complex behavior is working as expected (for example, searching a website, then clicking one of the search results). The non-configurable timeout for this monitor is 180 seconds. API test: Create an API script to ensure your API endpoint is working correctly. For more information, see Write API tests. The non-configurable timeout for this monitor is 180 seconds. Monitor name Defines a name for the monitor. Monitor names cannot contain unencoded angle brackets (< >). To include angle brackets in a monitor name, encode them as HTML bracket entities (&lt; &gt;) in the UI or API. Location Select the locations where you want your monitor to run. Select more locations to ensure that your application is available to users around the world. If you have any private locations, they will be listed here too. You can use the Synthetics API location endpoint to retrieve a list of valid locations for your account. Your monitor will run one check from each selected location during each frequency interval. For example, if you select three locations and define a frequency of 15 minutes, your monitor will run three checks in each 15 minute period (or 8,640 checks per month). Frequency Select how often the monitor runs, in increments of minutes, hours, or 1 day. This frequency applies to each location. For example, if you select three locations and a Frequency of 15 minutes, your monitor will run three checks, on average every 5 minutes, in each 15 minute period (or 8,640 checks per month). Alerts Specify an email address to receive alerts when a monitor fails. Or, attach a monitor to an existing alert policy for more notification options. For more information, see Alerting for synthetic monitoring. Apdex T Customize the Apdex T for this monitor. This setting is only available when editing the settings for an existing monitor, not when creating a new monitor. Change the Apdex T from the default 7 seconds for more accurate Apdex scores in your SLA reports. For example, if you have a very long scripted browser, you might adjust the Apdex T to 15 seconds to more closely reflect the usual completion time. Similarly, a good Apdex T for a simple browser check might be only 2 seconds. Response Validation (optional) Specify text to search for on the page.

      "body": "You can proactively monitor your website or API endpoints with synthetic monitors. Depending on the type of monitor, you can: Add and edit monitors. Use the Synthetics REST API to manage monitors. Set up monitors from specific locations or for private servers. You can also use the host not reporting feature in infrastructure monitoring. This allows you to take advantage of enhanced monitoring options and be notified when New Relic has stopped receiving data from your hosts. Types of monitors These are the seven types of synthetic monitors: Type of synthetic monitor Description Broken links monitor API name: SCRIPT_API Provide a url and this monitor will test all the links on the page for success. If a failure is detected you can view the individual non-successful links that caused the failure. Certificate check monitor API name: SCRIPT_API Proactively ping your domain certificates based on a configurable threshold. Pair with an alert to ensure you are notified when your certificates need renewed. Ping monitor API name: SIMPLE Ping monitors are the simplest type of monitor. They simply check to see if an application is online. The synthetic ping monitor uses a simple Java HTTP client to make requests to your site. For consistency with other synthetic monitor types, the user agent is identified as Google Chrome. However, the HTTP client is not a full browser, and it does not execute JavaScript. If you need JavaScript functionality, use a simple browser monitor. Step monitor API name: STEP_MONITOR Step monitors are advanced monitors which require no code to set up. The monitor can be configured to: Assert modal Assert text Assert title Assert an element Click an element Dismiss a modal Double click an element Enter a secure credential Hover over an element Locate an element by CSS class, HTML ID, link text, Xpath, or value Navigate to a URL Select from a dropdown Type text Simple browser monitors API name: BROWSER Simple browser monitors essentially are simple, pre-built scripted browser monitors. They make a request to your site using an instance of Google Chrome. Compared to a simple ping monitor, this is a more accurate emulation of an actual customer visit. The user agent is identified as Google Chrome. Scripted browser monitors API name: SCRIPT_BROWSER Scripted browser monitors are used for more sophisticated, customized monitoring. You can create a custom script that navigates your website, takes specific actions, and ensures specific resources are present. The monitor uses Google Chrome browser. You can also use a variety of third-party modules to build your custom monitor. API tests API name: SCRIPT_API API tests are used to monitor your API endpoints. This can ensure that your app server works in addition to your website. New Relic uses the http-request module internally to make HTTP calls to your endpoint and validate the results. You can add and edit synthetic monitors directly in our UI. You can also create some synthetic monitors with Terraform. To learn how, watch this short YouTube video (approx. 3:25 minutes).",

This allows you to take advantage of enhanced monitoring options and be notified when New Relic has stopped receiving data from your hosts. Types of monitors These are the seven types of synthetic monitors: Type of synthetic monitor Description Broken links monitor API name: SCRIPT_API Provide a url and this monitor will test all the links on the page for success. If a failure is detected you can view the individual non-successful links that caused the failure. Certificate check monitor API name: SCRIPT_API Proactively ping your domain certificates based on a configurable threshold.

They simply check to see if an application is online. The synthetic ping monitor uses a simple Java HTTP client to make requests to your site. For consistency with other synthetic monitor types, the user agent is identified as Google Chrome. However, the HTTP client is not a full browser, and it does not execute JavaScript. If you need JavaScript functionality, use a simple browser monitor. Step monitor API name: STEP_MONITOR Step monitors are advanced monitors which require no code to set up.

They make a request to your site using an instance of Google Chrome. Compared to a simple ping monitor, this is a more accurate emulation of an actual customer visit. The user agent is identified as Google Chrome. Scripted browser monitors API name: SCRIPT_BROWSER Scripted browser monitors are used for more sophisticated, customized monitoring. You can create a custom script that navigates your website, takes specific actions, and ensures specific resources are present. The monitor uses Google Chrome browser. You can also use a variety of third-party modules to build your custom monitor. API tests API name: SCRIPT_API API tests are used to monitor your API endpoints.

They can also: Capture aggregate numbers, including an overview or summary for ping monitors. Provide detailed statistics for each page resource, and downtime incidents. Collect custom response codes for more detail on your monitor runs. You'll be able to add and configure synthetic monitors to suit your environnment after you create a New Relic account. (It's free, forever!) Add a monitor You can add several types of synthetic monitors: Ping monitors ensure your website is responding, while simple browser monitors send real browsers to check your website. For more complex monitoring, scripted browser monitors verify that specific resources are present, while API tests verify your API endpoint. The default timeout for a new monitor is 180 seconds. To learn how to use our step monitor to build complex workflow validation scripts without writing any code, watch this short YouTube video (approx. 3:20 minutes). Add a ping or simple browser monitor Go to one.newrelic.com > Synthetics > Create monitor. Specify a monitor type, name, and URL (may be any valid HTTP or HTTPS URL). Optional: Add a validation string or Advanced options: A validation string is available for ping and simple browser. This option enables substring monitoring for response validation. Verify SSL is available for ping and simple browser. This option verifies the validity of the SSL certificate chain. It can be duplicated by running the following syntax: openssl s_client -servername {YOUR_HOSTNAME} -connect {YOUR_HOSTNAME}:443 -CApath /etc/ssl/certs -verify_hostname {YOUR_HOSTNAME} > /dev/null Copy If a non-zero exit code is returned, the monitor will fail. The Bypass HEAD request option is available for ping. This option skips the default HEAD request and instead uses the GET verb with a ping check. Redirect is Failure is available for ping. If a redirect result occurs when Redirect is Failure is enabled, New Relic Synthetics will categorize the result as a failure, rather than following the redirect and checking the resulting URL. Select the locations from which you want your monitor to run. Choose a frequency to determine how often each location will run your monitor. Optional: Set up alert notifications. Select Create my monitor to confirm. Generate some traffic and wait a few minutes, then check your monitor from the Monitors index. Add a scripted browser or API test monitor Go to one.newrelic.com > Synthetics > Create monitor. Specify a monitor type and name. Select the locations from which you want your monitor to run. Choose a frequency to determine how often each location will run your monitor. Optional: Set up alert notifications. Select Next: Write your script to create a script for your scripted browser or API test, then select Validate to verify your syntax. Tip For complex scripts, validation may take up to one minute. Select Create my monitor to confirm. Generate some traffic and wait a few minutes, then check your monitor from the Monitors index. Add a step monitor Go to one.newrelic.com > Synthetics > Create monitor. Select step monitor as the monitor type. Specify a name and choose a frequency to determine how often each location will run your monitor. Select the locations from which you want your monitor to run. Build your monitor by selecting from the preconfigured steps at the bottom of the UI: Navigate to a URL Type text Click an element Assert text Assert an element Secure a credential Use the instructions on the right side of the UI to help locate elements by CSS class, HTML ID, link text, or XPath. Select Save monitor to confirm. Generate some traffic and wait a few minutes, then check your monitor from the Monitors index. Add a certificate check monitor Go to one.newrelic.com > Synthetics > Create monitor. Select the certificate check monitor type. Specify a name and enter the domain you'd like to monitor. Enter the number of days it takes for your certificate to expire. Select the period to determine your monitor's frequency. Optional: Add tags to help you find this monitor later. Select the locations from which you want your monitor to run, and then click Save monitor to confirm. Generate some traffic and wait a few minutes, then check your monitor from the Monitors index. Add a broken links monitor Go to one.newrelic.com > Synthetics > Create monitor. Select the broken links check monitor type. Specify a name and enter the URL you'd like to monitor (may be any valid HTTP or HTTPS URL). Select the period to determine your monitor's frequency. Optional: Add tags to help you find this monitor later. Select the locations from which you want your monitor to run, and then click Save monitor to confirm. Generate some traffic and wait a few minutes, then check your monitor from the Monitors index. Tip You can also add monitors with the Synthetics REST API. For example, you can create a GET request to the monitor you want to use as the source for configuration, then use those key values to use in a POST to \"copy\" and create a new monitor. Edit a monitor You cannot change a monitor's type after the monitor is created, but you can edit other monitor settings. From the Monitors tab in one.newrelic.com > Synthetics, select the monitor you want to edit. In the side menu, select a link to change the following settings: Select Settings > General to edit name, Apdex T, URL, locations, frequency, and advanced options. For Scripted browser and API test monitors, select Settings > Script to edit your monitor script. For synthetic monitoring alerts, click Manage alerts. Select Save changes to confirm. Delete a monitor You must have Admin privileges in order to delete a monitor. To delete a monitor: From the Monitors tab in one.newrelic.com > Synthetics, select the monitor you want to edit. From the selected monitor, select Settings > General. Scroll to the bottom of the page and select the trash can icon. Tip You can also delete a monitor with the Synthetics REST API. Monitor settings When configuring monitors, the following settings are available: Type Select the type of monitor you want to create. A monitor's type can't be changed after the monitor is created. Ping: Specify a single URL to monitor for availability. New Relic will check this URL via HEAD or GET requests. The non-configurable timeout for this monitor is 60 seconds. Simple browser: Specify a single URL to monitor via real browser. Once each frequency interval, New Relic will check this URL via a Selenium-powered Google Chrome browser. The non-configurable timeout for this monitor is 60 seconds. Scripted browser: Create a script to drive a Selenium-powered Google Chrome browser. The browser follows each step in the script to verify that complex behavior is working as expected (for example, searching a website, then clicking one of the search results). The non-configurable timeout for this monitor is 180 seconds. API test: Create an API script to ensure your API endpoint is working correctly. For more information, see Write API tests. The non-configurable timeout for this monitor is 180 seconds. Monitor name Defines a name for the monitor. Monitor names cannot contain unencoded angle brackets (< >). To include angle brackets in a monitor name, encode them as HTML bracket entities (&lt; &gt;) in the UI or API. Location Select the locations where you want your monitor to run. Select more locations to ensure that your application is available to users around the world. If you have any private locations, they will be listed here too. You can use the Synthetics API location endpoint to retrieve a list of valid locations for your account. Your monitor will run one check from each selected location during each frequency interval. For example, if you select three locations and define a frequency of 15 minutes, your monitor will run three checks in each 15 minute period (or 8,640 checks per month). Frequency Select how often the monitor runs, in increments of minutes, hours, or 1 day. This frequency applies to each location. For example, if you select three locations and a Frequency of 15 minutes, your monitor will run three checks, on average every 5 minutes, in each 15 minute period (or 8,640 checks per month). Alerts Specify an email address to receive alerts when a monitor fails. Or, attach a monitor to an existing alert policy for more notification options. For more information, see Alerting for synthetic monitoring. Apdex T Customize the Apdex T for this monitor. This setting is only available when editing the settings for an existing monitor, not when creating a new monitor. Change the Apdex T from the default 7 seconds for more accurate Apdex scores in your SLA reports. For example, if you have a very long scripted browser, you might adjust the Apdex T to 15 seconds to more closely reflect the usual completion time. Similarly, a good Apdex T for a simple browser check might be only 2 seconds. Response Validation (optional) Specify text to search for on the page. When using simple browser or ping monitor types, there is a 1MB (10^6 bytes) limit on the page load.

For more complex monitoring, scripted browser monitors verify that specific resources are present, while API tests verify your API endpoint. The default timeout for a new monitor is 180 seconds. To learn how to use our step monitor to build complex workflow validation scripts without writing any code, watch this short YouTube video (approx. 3:20 minutes). Add a ping or simple browser monitor Go to one.newrelic.com > Synthetics > Create monitor. Specify a monitor type, name, and URL (may be any valid HTTP or HTTPS URL). Optional: Add a validation string or Advanced options: A validation string is available for ping and simple browser. This option enables substring monitoring for response validation. Verify SSL is available for ping and simple browser. This option verifies the validity of the SSL certificate chain. It can be duplicated by running the following syntax: openssl s_client -servername {YOUR_HOSTNAME} -connect {YOUR_HOSTNAME}:443 -CApath /etc/ssl/certs -verify_hostname {YOUR_HOSTNAME} > /dev/null Copy If a non-zero exit code is returned, the monitor will fail. The Bypass HEAD request option is available for ping. This option skips the default HEAD request and instead uses the GET verb with a ping check. Redirect is Failure is available for ping. If a redirect result occurs when Redirect is Failure is enabled, New Relic Synthetics will categorize the result as a failure, rather than following the redirect and checking the resulting URL. Select the locations from which you want your monitor to run. Choose a frequency to determine how often each location will run your monitor. Optional: Set up alert notifications. Select Create my monitor to confirm. Generate some traffic and wait a few minutes, then check your monitor from the Monitors index. Add a scripted browser or API test monitor Go to one.newrelic.com > Synthetics > Create monitor. Specify a monitor type and name. Select the locations from which you want your monitor to run. Choose a frequency to determine how often each location will run your monitor. Optional: Set up alert notifications. Select Next: Write your script to create a script for your scripted browser or API test, then select Validate to verify your syntax. Tip For complex scripts, validation may take up to one minute. Select Create my monitor to confirm. Generate some traffic and wait a few minutes, then check your monitor from the Monitors index. Add a step monitor Go to one.newrelic.com > Synthetics > Create monitor. Select step monitor as the monitor type. Specify a name and choose a frequency to determine how often each location will run your monitor. Select the locations from which you want your monitor to run. Build your monitor by selecting from the preconfigured steps at the bottom of the UI: Navigate to a URL Type text Click an element Assert text Assert an element Secure a credential Use the instructions on the right side of the UI to help locate elements by CSS class, HTML ID, link text, or XPath. Select Save monitor to confirm. Generate some traffic and wait a few minutes, then check your monitor from the Monitors index. Add a certificate check monitor Go to one.newrelic.com > Synthetics > Create monitor. Select the certificate check monitor type. Specify a name and enter the domain you'd like to monitor. Enter the number of days it takes for your certificate to expire. Select the period to determine your monitor's frequency. Optional: Add tags to help you find this monitor later. Select the locations from which you want your monitor to run, and then click Save monitor to confirm. Generate some traffic and wait a few minutes, then check your monitor from the Monitors index. Add a broken links monitor Go to one.newrelic.com > Synthetics > Create monitor. Select the broken links check monitor type. Specify a name and enter the URL you'd like to monitor (may be any valid HTTP or HTTPS URL). Select the period to determine your monitor's frequency. Optional: Add tags to help you find this monitor later. Select the locations from which you want your monitor to run, and then click Save monitor to confirm. Generate some traffic and wait a few minutes, then check your monitor from the Monitors index. Tip You can also add monitors with the Synthetics REST API. For example, you can create a GET request to the monitor you want to use as the source for configuration, then use those key values to use in a POST to \"copy\" and create a new monitor. Edit a monitor You cannot change a monitor's type after the monitor is created, but you can edit other monitor settings. From the Monitors tab in one.newrelic.com > Synthetics, select the monitor you want to edit. In the side menu, select a link to change the following settings: Select Settings > General to edit name, Apdex T, URL, locations, frequency, and advanced options. For Scripted browser and API test monitors, select Settings > Script to edit your monitor script. For synthetic monitoring alerts, click Manage alerts. Select Save changes to confirm. Delete a monitor You must have Admin privileges in order to delete a monitor. To delete a monitor: From the Monitors tab in one.newrelic.com > Synthetics, select the monitor you want to edit. From the selected monitor, select Settings > General. Scroll to the bottom of the page and select the trash can icon. Tip You can also delete a monitor with the Synthetics REST API. Monitor settings When configuring monitors, the following settings are available: Type Select the type of monitor you want to create. A monitor's type can't be changed after the monitor is created. Ping: Specify a single URL to monitor for availability. New Relic will check this URL via HEAD or GET requests. The non-configurable timeout for this monitor is 60 seconds. Simple browser: Specify a single URL to monitor via real browser. Once each frequency interval, New Relic will check this URL via a Selenium-powered Google Chrome browser. The non-configurable timeout for this monitor is 60 seconds. Scripted browser: Create a script to drive a Selenium-powered Google Chrome browser. The browser follows each step in the script to verify that complex behavior is working as expected (for example, searching a website, then clicking one of the search results). The non-configurable timeout for this monitor is 180 seconds. API test: Create an API script to ensure your API endpoint is working correctly. For more information, see Write API tests. The non-configurable timeout for this monitor is 180 seconds. Monitor name Defines a name for the monitor. Monitor names cannot contain unencoded angle brackets (< >). To include angle brackets in a monitor name, encode them as HTML bracket entities (&lt; &gt;) in the UI or API. Location Select the locations where you want your monitor to run. Select more locations to ensure that your application is available to users around the world. If you have any private locations, they will be listed here too. You can use the Synthetics API location endpoint to retrieve a list of valid locations for your account. Your monitor will run one check from each selected location during each frequency interval. For example, if you select three locations and define a frequency of 15 minutes, your monitor will run three checks in each 15 minute period (or 8,640 checks per month). Frequency Select how often the monitor runs, in increments of minutes, hours, or 1 day. This frequency applies to each location. For example, if you select three locations and a Frequency of 15 minutes, your monitor will run three checks, on average every 5 minutes, in each 15 minute period (or 8,640 checks per month). Alerts Specify an email address to receive alerts when a monitor fails. Or, attach a monitor to an existing alert policy for more notification options. For more information, see Alerting for synthetic monitoring. Apdex T Customize the Apdex T for this monitor. This setting is only available when editing the settings for an existing monitor, not when creating a new monitor. Change the Apdex T from the default 7 seconds for more accurate Apdex scores in your SLA reports. For example, if you have a very long scripted browser, you might adjust the Apdex T to 15 seconds to more closely reflect the usual completion time. Similarly, a good Apdex T for a simple browser check might be only 2 seconds. Response Validation (optional) Specify text to search for on the page. When using simple browser or ping monitor types, there is a 1MB (10^6 bytes) limit on the page load.

      "body": "You can proactively monitor your website or API endpoints with synthetic monitors. Depending on the type of monitor, you can: Add and edit monitors. Use the Synthetics REST API to manage monitors. Set up monitors from specific locations or for private servers. You can also use the host not reporting feature in infrastructure monitoring. This allows you to take advantage of enhanced monitoring options and be notified when New Relic has stopped receiving data from your hosts. Types of monitors These are the seven types of synthetic monitors: Type of synthetic monitor Description Broken links monitor API name: SCRIPT_API Provide a url and this monitor will test all the links on the page for success. If a failure is detected you can view the individual non-successful links that caused the failure. Certificate check monitor API name: SCRIPT_API Proactively ping your domain certificates based on a configurable threshold. Pair with an alert to ensure you are notified when your certificates need renewed. Ping monitor API name: SIMPLE Ping monitors are the simplest type of monitor. They simply check to see if an application is online. The synthetic ping monitor uses a simple Java HTTP client to make requests to your site. For consistency with other synthetic monitor types, the user agent is identified as Google Chrome. However, the HTTP client is not a full browser, and it does not execute JavaScript. If you need JavaScript functionality, use a simple browser monitor. Step monitor API name: STEP_MONITOR Step monitors are advanced monitors which require no code to set up. The monitor can be configured to: Assert modal Assert text Assert title Assert an element Click an element Dismiss a modal Double click an element Enter a secure credential Hover over an element Locate an element by CSS class, HTML ID, link text, Xpath, or value Navigate to a URL Select from a dropdown Type text Simple browser monitors API name: BROWSER Simple browser monitors essentially are simple, pre-built scripted browser monitors. They make a request to your site using an instance of Google Chrome. Compared to a simple ping monitor, this is a more accurate emulation of an actual customer visit. The user agent is identified as Google Chrome. Scripted browser monitors API name: SCRIPT_BROWSER Scripted browser monitors are used for more sophisticated, customized monitoring. You can create a custom script that navigates your website, takes specific actions, and ensures specific resources are present. The monitor uses Google Chrome browser. You can also use a variety of third-party modules to build your custom monitor. API tests API name: SCRIPT_API API tests are used to monitor your API endpoints. This can ensure that your app server works in addition to your website. New Relic uses the http-request module internally to make HTTP calls to your endpoint and validate the results. You can add and edit synthetic monitors directly in our UI. You can also create some synthetic monitors with Terraform. To learn how, watch this short YouTube video (approx. 3:25 minutes).",

      "body": "Synthetic monitors are API checks or virtual browser instances that monitor your website, recording each check in detail. They can also: Capture aggregate numbers, including an overview or summary for ping monitors. Provide detailed statistics for each page resource, and downtime incidents. Collect custom response codes for more detail on your monitor runs. You'll be able to add and configure synthetic monitors to suit your environnment after you create a New Relic account. (It's free, forever!) Add a monitor You can add several types of synthetic monitors: Ping monitors ensure your website is responding, while simple browser monitors send real browsers to check your website. For more complex monitoring, scripted browser monitors verify that specific resources are present, while API tests verify your API endpoint. The default timeout for a new monitor is 180 seconds. To learn how to use our step monitor to build complex workflow validation scripts without writing any code, watch this short YouTube video (approx. 3:20 minutes). Add a ping or simple browser monitor Go to one.newrelic.com > Synthetics > Create monitor. Specify a monitor type, name, and URL (may be any valid HTTP or HTTPS URL). Optional: Add a validation string or Advanced options: A validation string is available for ping and simple browser. This option enables substring monitoring for response validation. Verify SSL is available for ping and simple browser. This option verifies the validity of the SSL certificate chain. It can be duplicated by running the following syntax: openssl s_client -servername {YOUR_HOSTNAME} -connect {YOUR_HOSTNAME}:443 -CApath /etc/ssl/certs -verify_hostname {YOUR_HOSTNAME} > /dev/null Copy If a non-zero exit code is returned, the monitor will fail. The Bypass HEAD request option is available for ping. This option skips the default HEAD request and instead uses the GET verb with a ping check. Redirect is Failure is available for ping. If a redirect result occurs when Redirect is Failure is enabled, New Relic Synthetics will categorize the result as a failure, rather than following the redirect and checking the resulting URL. Select the locations from which you want your monitor to run. Choose a frequency to determine how often each location will run your monitor. Optional: Set up alert notifications. Select Create my monitor to confirm. Generate some traffic and wait a few minutes, then check your monitor from the Monitors index. Add a scripted browser or API test monitor Go to one.newrelic.com > Synthetics > Create monitor. Specify a monitor type and name. Select the locations from which you want your monitor to run. Choose a frequency to determine how often each location will run your monitor. Optional: Set up alert notifications. Select Next: Write your script to create a script for your scripted browser or API test, then select Validate to verify your syntax. Tip For complex scripts, validation may take up to one minute. Select Create my monitor to confirm. Generate some traffic and wait a few minutes, then check your monitor from the Monitors index. Add a step monitor Go to one.newrelic.com > Synthetics > Create monitor. Select step monitor as the monitor type. Specify a name and choose a frequency to determine how often each location will run your monitor. Select the locations from which you want your monitor to run. Build your monitor by selecting from the preconfigured steps at the bottom of the UI: Navigate to a URL Type text Click an element Assert text Assert an element Secure a credential Use the instructions on the right side of the UI to help locate elements by CSS class, HTML ID, link text, or XPath. Select Save monitor to confirm. Generate some traffic and wait a few minutes, then check your monitor from the Monitors index. Add a certificate check monitor Go to one.newrelic.com > Synthetics > Create monitor. Select the certificate check monitor type. Specify a name and enter the domain you'd like to monitor. Enter the number of days it takes for your certificate to expire. Select the period to determine your monitor's frequency. Optional: Add tags to help you find this monitor later. Select the locations from which you want your monitor to run, and then click Save monitor to confirm. Generate some traffic and wait a few minutes, then check your monitor from the Monitors index. Add a broken links monitor Go to one.newrelic.com > Synthetics > Create monitor. Select the broken links check monitor type. Specify a name and enter the URL you'd like to monitor (may be any valid HTTP or HTTPS URL). Select the period to determine your monitor's frequency. Optional: Add tags to help you find this monitor later. Select the locations from which you want your monitor to run, and then click Save monitor to confirm. Generate some traffic and wait a few minutes, then check your monitor from the Monitors index. Tip You can also add monitors with the Synthetics REST API. For example, you can create a GET request to the monitor you want to use as the source for configuration, then use those key values to use in a POST to \"copy\" and create a new monitor. Edit a monitor You cannot change a monitor's type after the monitor is created, but you can edit other monitor settings. From the Monitors tab in one.newrelic.com > Synthetics, select the monitor you want to edit. In the side menu, select a link to change the following settings: Select Settings > General to edit name, Apdex T, URL, locations, frequency, and advanced options. For Scripted browser and API test monitors, select Settings > Script to edit your monitor script. For synthetic monitoring alerts, click Manage alerts. Select Save changes to confirm. Delete a monitor You must have Admin privileges in order to delete a monitor. To delete a monitor: From the Monitors tab in one.newrelic.com > Synthetics, select the monitor you want to edit. From the selected monitor, select Settings > General. Scroll to the bottom of the page and select the trash can icon. Tip You can also delete a monitor with the Synthetics REST API. Monitor settings When configuring monitors, the following settings are available: Type Select the type of monitor you want to create. A monitor's type can't be changed after the monitor is created. Ping: Specify a single URL to monitor for availability. New Relic will check this URL via HEAD or GET requests. The non-configurable timeout for this monitor is 60 seconds. Simple browser: Specify a single URL to monitor via real browser. Once each frequency interval, New Relic will check this URL via a Selenium-powered Google Chrome browser. The non-configurable timeout for this monitor is 60 seconds. Scripted browser: Create a script to drive a Selenium-powered Google Chrome browser. The browser follows each step in the script to verify that complex behavior is working as expected (for example, searching a website, then clicking one of the search results). The non-configurable timeout for this monitor is 180 seconds. API test: Create an API script to ensure your API endpoint is working correctly. For more information, see Write API tests. The non-configurable timeout for this monitor is 180 seconds. Monitor name Defines a name for the monitor. Monitor names cannot contain unencoded angle brackets (< >). To include angle brackets in a monitor name, encode them as HTML bracket entities (&lt; &gt;) in the UI or API. Location Select the locations where you want your monitor to run. Select more locations to ensure that your application is available to users around the world. If you have any private locations, they will be listed here too. You can use the Synthetics API location endpoint to retrieve a list of valid locations for your account. Your monitor will run one check from each selected location during each frequency interval. For example, if you select three locations and define a frequency of 15 minutes, your monitor will run three checks in each 15 minute period (or 8,640 checks per month). Frequency Select how often the monitor runs, in increments of minutes, hours, or 1 day. This frequency applies to each location. For example, if you select three locations and a Frequency of 15 minutes, your monitor will run three checks, on average every 5 minutes, in each 15 minute period (or 8,640 checks per month). Alerts Specify an email address to receive alerts when a monitor fails. Or, attach a monitor to an existing alert policy for more notification options. For more information, see Alerting for synthetic monitoring. Apdex T Customize the Apdex T for this monitor. This setting is only available when editing the settings for an existing monitor, not when creating a new monitor. Change the Apdex T from the default 7 seconds for more accurate Apdex scores in your SLA reports. For example, if you have a very long scripted browser, you might adjust the Apdex T to 15 seconds to more closely reflect the usual completion time. Similarly, a good Apdex T for a simple browser check might be only 2 seconds. Response Validation (optional) Specify text to search for on the page. When using simple browser or ping monitor types, there is a 1MB (10^6 bytes) limit on the page load.

The main ways to find and use APM data in infrastructure monitoring are: View APM charts on infrastructure monitoring UI pages Filter hosts by application data Switch between infrastructure and APM Examine APM data in Inventory and Events pages Infrastructure data appears in APM in the host table on the APM Summary page. View logs for your APM and infrastructure data You can also bring your logs and application's data together to make troubleshooting easier and faster. With logs in context, you can see log messages related to your errors and traces directly in your app's UI. You can also see logs in context of your infrastructure data, such as Kubernetes clusters. No need to switch to another UI page in New Relic One. How to integrate APM and infrastructure data For APM and infrastructure data to be integrated, all of the following must be true: The APM agent and the infrastructure agent must be installed on the same host. Both agents must use the same New Relic license key. They must use the same hostname. If the integration is not working, see Troubleshooting the APM-Infrastructure integration. View APM charts When your APM and infrastructure data is linked, you have access to APM data charts on these Infrastructure monitoring UI pages: Hosts, Network, Storage, and Processes. To switch to different charts: select the dropdown beside a chart's name and choose a new chart. Application-related charts will be near the top. one.newrelic.com > Infrastructure > Hosts: If your APM and Infrastructure data is linked, the charts in Infrastructure monitoring can be changed to show your application data. Filter by application data When your APM and infrastructure data is linked, you can filter displayed host data using Applications: From the host filter, select Applications. Select the application you want to filter on. Tip On the Hosts page, you can also filter by selecting items in the Applications column. Switch between infrastructure and APM When your APM and infrastructure accounts are linked, you can switch over from infrastructure to APM and vice versa for the same selected time range. You can switch from infrastructure to APM from these locations: From the host filter Applications menu On the Hosts page, when selecting applications in the Applications table column. You can switch from APM to infrastructure from the host table on the APM Summary page. APM data in Inventory and Events When your APM and infrastructure data is linked, you can view and filter on application data on the Infrastructure monitoring UI's Inventory page and the Events page. View host data in APM When your APM and infrastructure data is linked, you have more available host data in APM. The APM Summary page contains a table with data about your app's hosts and instances, including: Apdex Response time Throughput Error rate CPU usage Memory You can toggle between a table view or breakout metric details for the individual hosts by selecting View table or Break out each metric by host. For more information on host data on the APM Summary page, see host details. Troubleshoot missing APM data APM/Infrastructure integration should happen automatically if you have both the APM agent and the infrastructure agent installed on the same host(s) and they use the same New Relic license key and have the same hostname set.

You can also extend your performance monitoring to collect and analyze business data to help you improve the customer experience and make data-driven business decisions. With flexible options for custom instrumentation and APIs, The Python agent offers multiple building blocks to customize the data you need from your app. Our Python works with a wide variety of web frameworks and hosting mechanisms, including Django, Gunicorn, WSGI, CherryPy, uWSGI, and more. You can also install the Python agent in a Google App Engine flexible environment. Monitor app performance After you install the Python agent, it begins to collect data about your app. You can view the data as charts and tables in New Relic One. View the big picture of your app: Monitor your app's Apdex (user satisfaction). Get a high-level summary of your app with Summary page. Enable distributed tracing to see activity across an architecture having many services. Install Infrastructure monitoring and view detailed server/host data for your app. Find errors and problems quickly: Track key transactions specific to your business. Create custom dashboards for important metrics. Alert your team when an error or problem occurs before it affects your users. View performance after a deployment. Drill down into performance details: Examine code-level transaction traces. Examine database query traces. Examine error traces. Use thread profiler sessions to see detailed stack traces of sampled threads View logs for your APM and infrastructure data: Bring your logs and application's data together to make troubleshooting easier and faster. No need to switch to another UI page in New Relic One. With logs in context, you can see log messages related to your errors and traces directly in your app's UI. You can also see logs in context of your infrastructure data, such as Kubernetes clusters. Extend agent instrumentation: Other helpful tools include: Tools Description Browser monitoring Integrate the Python agent with browser monitoring to gain visibility into end-user browser activity. Simple scripts and background tasks Monitor job-based or task queuing systems, like Celery, or other standalone non-web functions. Business data analysis with data exploration. Use the Python agent with our data explorer to organize, query, and visualize your data to answer key questions about application performance and customer experience. Use default transaction attributes, or add your own. Query your data using the New Relic Query Language (NRQL). Send your own event data. Create and share customizable, interactive dashboards. Install the Python agent Before you install the Python agent, make sure your system meets the system requirements. You must also create a New Relic account. We support a number of web frameworks and libraries right out of the box, including Django, WSGI, and Gunicorn. If you use one of the supported web frameworks, installation is easy. If you use an unsupported framework, the process will involve some additions to your app code and/or web server files. For a quick and simple install process that will work for the majority of setups, follow these simple steps: Download and install the Python package. Create config file. Integrate the Python agent with your application. Read the Quick Start guide Add Python data Monitor non-web scripts, background tasks, and functions The Python agent also lets you monitor non-web scripts, worker processes, tasks, and functions. The installation process for these non-web transactions is similar to the one used for a web app, with one major difference: instead of going through the standard integration process described in the install instructions, you would manually \"wrap\" any function you want to monitor. For more information, see Non-web tasks and processes. For instructions on monitoring Celery tasks, see Celery background tasks. What's next after installation? Once you get the agent up and running, some suggested next steps are: Explore your data in and get comfortable with the user interface. Read our docs on our other observability solutions and the APM page. Change your application's name, or other configuration options. Learn about setting up custom instrumentation for application activity not monitored by default. Consider the Python Telemetry SDK. Troubleshooting After you complete the install process, your data should appear in the APM UI within five minutes. If it does not, use these troubleshooting resources: If no data appears, follow these troubleshooting steps. If you experience issues when installing or running the Python agent on a new host, test that the package is installed correctly and that it can contact New Relic's data collector service. For other problems, see the full list of troubleshooting documentation. Check the source code The Python agent is open source software. That means you can browse its source code and send improvements, or create your own fork and build it. For more information, see the README.",

      "body": "Problem You installed the infrastructure agent and waited a few minutes, but no data appears in the infrastructure UI. Solution Data should appear in the Infrastructure monitoring UI within a few minutes for accounts with previously installed agents. Important For accounts installing the infrastructure agent for the first time, the latency for data appearing in the Infrastructure monitoring UI can be tens of minutes. If the following steps verify the installation and no obvious error conditions appear in the verbose logs, monitor the Infrastructure UI for a longer period before contacting support.newrelic.com for assistance. Important By default, the infrastructure agent doesn't send data about the operating system's processes. To enable the sending of process data set enable_process_metrics to true. To fine-tune which processes you want to monitor, configure include_matching_metrics. Missing infrastructure data If no data appears in the UI, try the following steps to diagnose the problem: Use your package manager to verify that the infrastructure agent is installed: Verify install for apt (Debian or Ubuntu) Use dpkg to verify that the agent is installed: dpkg -l | grep newrelic-infra Copy If dpkg returns no output, see Install with apt. Verify install for yum (Amazon Linux, CentOS, or RHEL) Use rpm to verify that agent is installed: rpm -qa | grep newrelic-infra Copy If rpm returns no output, see Install with yum. Verify install for Windows Server Use the Windows command prompt or Powershell to verify that the agent directory exists: dir \"C:\\Program Files\\New Relic\\newrelic-infra\" Copy If you receive a File not found error, see Install for Windows Server. Use your init system to verify that the agent is running: Verify status with SystemD Use SystemD commands with CentOS 7, Debian 8, RHEL 7, and Ubuntu 15.04 or higher: Check that the agent is running: sudo systemctl status newrelic-infra Copy If the agent isn't running, start the agent manually: sudo systemctl start newrelic-infra Copy Verify status with System V Use System V commands with Debian 7: Check that the agent is running: sudo /etc/init.d/newrelic-infra status Copy If the agent isn't running, start the agent manually: sudo /etc/init.d/newrelic-infra start Copy Verify status with Upstart Use Upstart commands with Amazon Linux, CentOS 6, RHEL 6, and Ubuntu 14.10 or lower: Check that the agent is running: sudo initctl status newrelic-infra Copy If the agent isn't running, start the agent manually: sudo initctl start newrelic-infra Copy Verify status with Windows Use the Windows command prompt: Check that the agent is running: sc query \"newrelic-infra\" | find \"RUNNING\" Copy If the agent isn't running, start the agent manually with the Windows command prompt: net start newrelic-infra Copy If running net start newrelic-infra returns The service name is invalid, the Infrastructure agent may not have been installed correctly and the service was not properly created. To test this: From Powershell, run the command get-service newrelic-infra, which will return the status of the service. If it returns an error Cannot find any service with service name newrelic-infra, then follow standard procedures to reinstall the agent. Use New Relic Diagnostics to try to automatically identify the issue. Verify that your newrelic-infra.yml configuration file contains a valid license_key setting. Verify that the host has a unique hostname, and verify that the hostname is not localhost. For more information, see this Explorers Hub post. Verify that no firewalls or proxies are blocking outbound connections from the agent process to the Infrastructure domains and ports. Confirm the host is reporting correctly even though it is not appearing in the Infrastructure monitoring UI by creating a basic query in Query builder, like: SELECT * FROM SystemSample SINCE 60 minutes ago LIMIT 100 Copy Use the query results to note the timestamps, which show when the data was reported. To determine when data was first received, look at the earliest timestamp. Generate verbose logs and examine the logs for errors.

      "body": "To view workloads, go to one.newrelic.com and find them on the Explorer. There are three main tabs (Health, Activity, and Owner) plus the header. Health The Health tab in a workload provides relevant status data that helps you operate the workload: It shows the global status of the workload, as well as the individual status of all the entities that make up the workload at each point in time. It looks like this: It comprises the following: The navigator view shows the entities that make up the workload, and provides controls to group and sort them. If you’ve used queries to dynamically select entities, the workload entities will change over time. The workload status informs about how your workload is performing, based on the individual alerting status of the entities in your workload. With health over time you’ll see whether and how the workload status has changed in the past three hours. If one or more entities are alerting, you’ll get a count of criticals and warnings and a summary of the open conditions, which will make it easier to identify and troubleshoot the most important issues. Activity The Activity tab shows performance data related to the entities in the workload, along with the events that could explain any changes in those time series. It looks like this: Here are the most important sections: Linked dashboards. You can add links to dashboards from your workload, and create pre-filtered, workload-relevant links to dashboards. Golden metrics. These are charts with the most relevant metrics for each entity type, such as number of requests, response time, and error rate for an application. Explore the charts to detect correlations among different entities (for example, two applications) and different stack layers (for example, applications and hosts). The golden metrics that you see for each entity type on a workload can be customized either at the account or the workload level through the NerdGraph API. Events timeline. This includes the start and end time of incidents and anomalies that refer to the workload entities. It also shows other event types that can explain a change in the status or performance of the workload, such as deployments and configuration changes. You can control which golden metrics are used to visualize your workload entities by using the golden metrics API. To learn more, watch this short video (approx. 4 minutes). Owner The Owner tab gives you information about the team responsible for the workload. It looks like this: It contains: The team responsible for the workload. You can include more than one team. The workload description. Share the mission of the workload, and the business logic it represents: Is it a web application? An API? A backend process? Fill in any details that are relevant to your team, or to other teams in your organization. Contact information. From the drop-down menu, choose how your team prefers to be contacted. Links to the most relevant resources to operate the workload. Here you can add links to runbooks, code repositories, productivity tools, or anything else related to the workload that you need at hand. Header The header contains the filter bar and the edition controls: Filter bar. Use the advanced filtering options when you need to focus only on certain entities within the workload. Edit workload. Define the entities that are part of the workload, and the accounts they’ll be fetched from. Setup status. Configure how the global workload status will be determined, based on the workload entities health. Summary page. See all the tags that have been added to the workload, as well as metadata such as the workload's identifier (GUID) and account. You can create workloads that update dynamically by leveraging tags. To learn how, watch this short video (approx. 3 minutes). Create a workload A workload should contain the entities you and your team want to see. Your choice of entities depends on your organization structure and goals. one.newrelic.com > Explorer > Workloads > Create a workload: When you create a workload, you choose the associated accounts and monitored entities. You can use New Relic One or the NerdGraph API to create a workload. Follow these steps to create a workload using the UI: Go to one.newrelic.com and click on the Explorer, and then click + Create a workload. Give the workload a name that will be meaningful for you and your team later. From the Select an account dropdown, select the workload account you'd like to use. Click Choose the scope accounts to check all of the accounts related to this workload. Find and choose the entities that make up the workload. When you have the results you're looking for, you can add specific entities or add the query to dynamically update the entities in the workload. You can search by entity type, tags, or attributes (like entity name, account ID, and AWS region). Click + Add this query to create a list of dynamically updated entities for your workload. We recommend this if you want your workload to update its entities as your system changes. Click + Add next to an entity to add it to your workload. This is a good choice if you know that the entities will stay useful even as your system changes. You can add a combination of queries and specific entities to the workload, which combine according to the query logic. Click Create a workload to save the workload. Once you've created the workload, you can edit it at any time If your workload contains one or more dashboards, you can set filters on those dashboard links. Below are more details about some aspects of how to define workloads: Use tags to define the workload content You can query and select workload entities using both tags and attributes. Therefore, to optimize your use of workloads, it helps to have a good entity-tagging strategy. We recommend reading the tagging documentation. How the dynamic query logic works You can add several individual entities and queries to define a workload. Queries can include multiple search terms. These are combined with an AND operator. Separate queries within a workload are combined with an OR operator. You can wrap strings between percent signs (%) to match exact substrings within a query. If you use substrings in entity names to categorize those entities (for example, <team>-<env>-<appName>), consider using tags complementarily, which are more powerful for filtering and grouping (for example, team:awesome, env:production). We recommend not to use percent signs (%) in dynamic queries that might return over 500 entities. This way, you get a more consistent experience in the user interface. Add dashboards to workloads If you have custom dashboards and you already know which data is relevant to your team for observing and operating their workloads, you can link those dashboards from your workload. You can also set filters on dashboards to scope them to a workload-specific context. When a user selects that dashboard from the workload, it opens with the filter already applied. one.newrelic.com > Apps > Workloads: You can add dashboards to a workload. To add dashboards to a workload: When creating or editing a workload, type Dashboard in the workload search bar to filter to dashboard entities. Add other search terms to filter to specific dashboards. Click Add. one.newrelic.com > Apps > Workloads: You can set filters on the dashboards you've linked to a workload. To filter a workload’s dashboard: From a workload’s Overview page, select a dashboard. Add search terms to filter the dashboard to a view that’s relevant for that workload. Select Save filter for this workload. Use the API You can query, create, and update workloads with our NerdGraph API.",

      "body": "New Relic provides integrations and quickstarts for many popular services and frameworks. If you have New Relic and want to report data from a service we don't have an integration for, there are several ways New Relic lets you create your own integration: With New Relic infrastructure monitoring, you can use our lightweight Flex tool (recommended, documented below) or, to build a complete on-host integration, see our Integrations SDK. Telemetry (metrics, traces) monitoring solutions: Use our Telemetry SDKs. Build a custom New Relic One application that uses your own JavaScript UI functionality. What is Flex? New Relic Flex is an application-agnostic, all-in-one tool that allows you to collect metric data from a wide variety of services. It comes bundled with our infrastructure agent. You can instrument any app that exposes metrics over a standard protocol (HTTP, file, shell) in a standard format (for example, JSON or plain text): you create a YAML config file, start the Infrastructure agent, and your data is reported to New Relic. Flex can send event and metric data to New Relic from a wide range of sources. Using a simple YAML config file, you can run HTTP/HTTPS requests, run shell commands, and parse file content. You can also use standard regex expressions to customize and control the data gathered from those inputs. See an example config. After collecting and cleaning up the data, you can then query Flex data in New Relic, create custom charts for it, and use that data in your dashboards. Requirements Flex comes bundled with our infrastructure agent. To use Flex, you need: Infrastructure agent version 1.10.7 or higher (update | check version) running on Linux, Windows, or Kubernetes. How does Flex work? Flex uses our infrastructure agent to execute commands that generate the data you want to report. Here's a brief overview of how Flex works to report data: You define the data you want to report in a YAML configuration file, located in the infrastructure agent package. See an example configuration: Example config The following is an example of a Flex configuration for monitoring the uptime of a Linux server. This configuration is placed in a file named flex-uptime.yml. This would be placed in the infrastructure agent's integration configuration section, located at /etc/newrelic-infra/integrations.d/flex-uptime.yml. integrations: - name: nri-flex config: name: linuxUptimeIntegration apis: - name: Uptime commands: - run: 'cat /proc/uptime' split: horizontal split_by: \\s+ set_header: [uptimeSeconds,idletimeSeconds] Copy Some notes on what this configuration does: run defines the command to execute. The name indicated by name: Uptime is appended with Sample to generate an event called UptimeSample. The name should not start with the ESX or PCF prefix. The split_by: \\s+ splits the fields based on the space character. The command generates attributes attached to the UptimeSample event. The attributes are named uptimeSeconds and idletimeSeconds. The infrastructure agent runs Flex at a frequency based on its own configuration (default: every 30 seconds) and sends the data to New Relic. You can then query your data, create custom charts with it, and add it to dashboards. Learn more The Flex integration comes bundled with the infrastructure agent. Learn more about requirements.

      "body": "BETA FEATURE This feature is currently in beta. What permissions do I need to use New Relic's service levels? To use New Relic's service levels and see SLO results, you need a full platform user. However, in order to create new SLIs and SLOs, you need the specific capability in your role to modify events to metric rules. If you get the following errors, check your user permissions: The UI has disabled the option to save an SLI/SLO. The API returns the error message “Cannot query field \\\"eventExportRegisterRule\\\" on type \\\"RootMutationType\\\".”. How do I get support from New Relic during the public beta? Service level management is in public beta, and no official support is offered yet through the Support portal. If you have general questions and feedback, please post them on the Explorers Hub. New Relic’s community and the product team will be glad to help you there. If you have suggestions about documentation, please suggest an improvement or send your contribution using the Create issue or Edit page buttons on the top right corner in the docs UI. Why don’t I see any data right after I create an SLI? New Relic starts generating new SLI metrics from the moment that you create an SLI. This is why we need a few minutes before we can start showing the first meaningful SLI attainment results. The benefit of the new data is that it has 13 month retention by default, and it’s more efficient to query for long periods of time. Can I configure an SLI on any entity type? Yes, you can configure an SLI on any entity type, such as an APM service, a browser application, or a Lambda function. SLI queries support NRDB events. Support for dimensional metrics on SLI queries is on our roadmap. Can I get alerts on SLI data? Alerts on New Relic's service levels are on our roadmap. How does New Relic calculate the remaining error budget? The remaining error budget indicates what percentage of requests could still have a bad response over the SLO period without compromising the objective. Therefore, the total amount of tolerated bad responses will vary with the throughput of requests. Time-based error budgets are on our roadmap. How can I view the queries that define an SLI from the UI? To view the queries that define an SLI, you can click on the ... menu on the SLI summary card, then select the Edit option. The queries will show at the top-right corner. How can I view the queries that define an SLI through the API? To view the queries that define an SLI through the API, use Nerdgraph. In order to view the SLI configuration, you'll need to know the GUID of the entity the SLI is attached to, and replace it in the following query: { actor { entity(guid: \"{entityGuid}\") { serviceLevel { indicators { events { badEvents { where from } goodEvents { from where } validEvents { from where } } name } } } } } Copy As a response you are going to receive all the SLIs attached to the entity, the SLI name, and the queries. Keep in mind that either goodEvents or badEvents is going to have content, depending on the configuration of the SLI. Can I chart the SLI attainment on a dashboard? You can chart SLI attainment time series on your custom dashboards using the following query: FROM Metric SELECT clamp_max((count(newrelic.sli.valid) - count(newrelic.sli.bad)) / count(newrelic.sli.valid) * 100, 100) as 'SLI attainment' WHERE sli.id = '<sli.id>' UNTIL 2 MINUTES AGO TIMESERIES AUTO Copy Where sli.id is the SLI identifier. The easiest way to add a chart like this to your dashboard is by using the Add to dashboard option, available on the Details view. Alternatively, you can find the SLI id and SLI attainment query through the Nerdgraph API with the following query: { actor { entity(guid: \"{entityGuid}\") { serviceLevel { indicators { name id resultQueries { indicator { nrql } } } } } } } Copy Use the entityGuid of the entity that's associated with the SLI. On the query results, you’ll get the SLI id in the serviceLevel.indicators.id field.",

      "body": "BETA FEATURE This feature is currently in beta. With New Relic you can define and consume service level indicators and service level objectives for your applications. What are SLIs and SLOs? Service levels are used to measure the performance of a service from the end user (or client application) point of view. For instance, a Service Level can represent whether a video loaded quickly enough, or whether a directions service returned at least one possible route between two points. Service level indicators (SLIs) are accurate quantitative measures of the user experience as described by a service level. They represent a proportion of successful outputs, and therefore they’re expressed as a percentage (%). For example, an SLI can measure the proportion of requests that were faster than some threshold, or the proportion of records coming into a pipeline that resulted in the correct value coming out. And while users understand that a video might take a few additional seconds to load, or that an application might return an error from time to time, this shouldn’t happen often if you don’t want to lose their trust. Therefore, once you’ve defined SLIs for the performance aspects that are most relevant for the end users of your services, you need to set SLOs to track that the service is meeting their expectations. Service level objectives (SLOs) are defined as a target value that an SLI must meet over a period of time. For example, videos must start playing in less than 2 seconds 99% of the time over a week period. Please refer to the Service level management use case implementation guide to learn more about identifying service boundaries and deploying the instrumentation that your service levels will be based on. Service levels and APM SLA reports New Relic has provided automatic SLA Reports for APM Services for a long time. The Apdex-based reports, which you can get on your email inbox on Mondays, are automatically generated for services that produce web transactions, and are useful to see trends over time. On top of the SLAs, our new SLM level capability is better aligned with modern service level best practices, such as those promoted by the Google SRE Handbook, and provides new, improved functionality: SLIs can be defined on any NRDB event that is reported to New Relic, not just APM transactions. Therefore you can also base SLIs on your own custom events. You can decide which service boundaries and which metrics are relevant for your service levels, and you can set your own objectives. You can view SLO results across your accounts, and within your workloads. What's next? Ready to get started? If you don't already have one, sign up for a free New Relic account. You can find service levels in several places in New Relic One: At the top nav bar, under the More menu (which you can customize). At the previews of those entities that have an SLI defined. In APM services, at the reports section. Within a workload, at the service levels tab. Carry on and read our docs on how to create and consume SLIs and SLOs. You can also check out how to manage SLMs with our API.",

Our guided install creates a customized CLI command for your environment that downloads and installs the New Relic CLI and the infrastructure agent. Ready to get started? Click the Guided install button. Or, if your account reports data through our EU data center, click EU Guided install. Guided install EU Guided install Our infrastructure agent discovers the applications and infrastructure and log sources running in your environment, and recommends which ones should be instrumented. The install automates the configuration and deployment of each system you choose to instrument. Why it matters With our guided install, you can instrument your applications and infrastructure and start seeing your data in New Relic in minutes. The guided install uses our command line interface (CLI), the infrastructure agent for your host environment, and a library of installation recipes to instrument your applications and infrastructure for you. That means less toil for you. Because our instrumentation recipes are open source, you can modify existing recipes, or build new ones, to suit your needs. Some technical detail The New Relic guided install uses open source installation recipes to instrument on-host integrations. These recipes include installation and setup commands, information about logs, and metadata related to what’s being installed. They're collected in a YAML file for each type of system and have all of the installation details necessary to install the infrastructure agent for a specific integration. Important On Windows, our guided install only supports Microsoft SQL Server, logs, and the infrastructure agent. All other integrations are only supported on Linux. On-host integration (OHI) recipes The guided install automates the discovery, configuration, and installation of OHIs. However, there may be times when you want to instrument them one-by-one using the CLI install command. To install any individual on-host integration, run this command: curl -Ls https://raw.githubusercontent.com/newrelic/newrelic-cli/master/scripts/install.sh | bash && sudo NEW_RELIC_API_KEY=API_KEY NEW_RELIC_ACCOUNT_ID=ACCOUNT_ID /usr/local/bin/newrelic install -n INTEGRATION-FLAG Copy For example: curl -Ls https://raw.githubusercontent.com/newrelic/newrelic-cli/master/scripts/install.sh | bash && sudo NEW_RELIC_API_KEY=<API_KEY> NEW_RELIC_ACCOUNT_ID=<ACCOUNT_ID> /usr/local/bin/newrelic install -n apache-open-source-integration Copy The table lists the integrations supported by the guided install CLI command. The specific on-host integration commands are provided for your reference. Our open source integrations send performance metrics and inventory data from your servers and applications to the New Relic platform. You can view pre-built dashboards of your metric data, create alert policies, and create your own custom queries and charts.

MySQL: Incorrect user permissions To monitor MySQL health data, you need a valid username and password with specific permissions. These commands will create a user and grant the required permissions: Create a user newrelic@localhost with a specific password. sudo mysql -e \"CREATE USER 'newrelic'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY 'YOUR_SELECTED_PASSWORD';\" Copy Give replication privileges to newrelic@localhost with a maximum of 5 connections. sudo mysql -e \"GRANT REPLICATION CLIENT ON *.* TO 'newrelic'@'localhost' WITH MAX_USER_CONNECTIONS 5;\" Copy Give select privileges to newrelic@localhost with a maximum of 5 connections. sudo mysql -e \"GRANT SELECT ON *.* TO 'newrelic'@'localhost' WITH MAX_USER_CONNECTIONS 5;\" Copy Once done, your next guided install attempt should work. NGINX: No status URL To monitor your NGINX server, you'll need to configure a valid status URL. status_url: The URL set up to provide the metrics using the status module. If the default value of 127.0.0.1 is incorrect, substitute the address/FQDN/URL for your system. Example: status_url: http://127.0.0.1/status You can read more about the status_url in these NGINX docs: For NGINX Open Source: HTTP stub status module For NGINX Plus: HTTP status module and HTTP API module There are different ways to set status_url, depending on how NGINX was installed: If enabled via Kubernetes: See Monitor services running on Kubernetes. If enabled via Amazon ECS: See Monitor services running on ECS. If installed on-host: Edit the config in the integration's YAML config file, nginx-config.yml.",

It's free, forever! account dropdown In the upper right of the New Relic UI, the account dropdown gives you access to your account settings. If you're trying to switch between accounts, use the account switcher. account switcher If you have access to more than one account in a multi-account organization, you can use the account switcher to switch between accounts. This is located in the top right of most New Relic UI pages. For more on factors that affect access to accounts, see Factors affecting access. To find account settings, use the account dropdown. administrator A type of user role on a New Relic account. For more information, see Users. agent At New Relic, an agent is a piece of monitoring software that provides integrations with various technologies (for example, web frameworks, host operating systems, or database types). The agents send that data to New Relic, usually on a specific cadence. For more information, see: New Relic Instant Observability Install agents agent API Some New Relic agents have agent APIs that allow you to extend the functionality of an agent. You can use the API to control, customize and extend the functionality of the agent. Here are some agent API docs: APM agents: C SDK API Go agent API Java agent API .NET agent API Node.js agent API PHP agent API Ruby agent API Python agent API Browser agent: Browser agent API Mobile agents: iOS SDK API Android SDK API aggregated metrics Aggregated metric data summarizes calls to specific methods in your application, including how many times each one was called and response times. In the New Relic UI, you see the class and method names along with their aggregate numbers. Metric data aggregation depends on the New Relic tool and your subscription level. For more information, see the documentation about data retention. aggregation delay The length of time in seconds to wait for the aggregation window to fill with data. Required when using CADENCE or EVENT_FLOW aggreation_method types. aggregation function You can use NRQL query functions, such as sum(), average(), or latest() to choose how the data points in an aggregation window should be processed into a single data point. The single aggregated data point is what's passed through the alert evaluation process. aggregation method New Relic aggregates data into windows, and needs to determine when the current window ends and the next one begins. The aggregation_method is the logic that tells us when we have all the data for a given aggregation window. Once the window is closed, the data is aggregated into a single point and evaluated against the threshold. This field is optional. One of the following three values can be specified: EVENT_FLOW: (Default) Each aggregation window will wait until it starts to see timestamps arrive that are past its own delay setting. Once this occurs, the data is published. Relies on the timestamps of arriving data, so wall-clock time is no longer relevant. Works best for sources that come in frequently and with low event spread (high througput metrics) CADENCE: Classic New Relic logic where each evaluation window waits exactly as long as the aggregation_delay setting, using the wall-clock time as a timer. aggregation_delay is required when using this option. Data arriving too late will be dropped, which can cause false alerts. EVENT_TIMER: Each aggregation window has a timer on it, set to the aggregation_timer setting. The Timer starts running as soon as the first data point appears for that aggregation window (based on the data point’s timestamp). The aggregation_timer is reset for each new data point that arrives for that window. Once the aggregation_timer reaches 0, the aggregation window is published. Ideal for sparse and batched data, such as cloud integrations and infrequent error logs. aggregation timer The length of time in seconds to wait after each data point received, to ensure the entire batch is processed. Required when using EVENT_TIMER aggregation_method type. aggregation window Streaming alerts gathers data together into specific amounts of time. These windows of time are customizable. Data points are collected together based their timestamps and reported as a batch. The customizable aggregation window provides greater flexibility and fewer false violations when alerting on irregular or less frequent data points. alert An alert communicates an event or incident that designated personnel can track through Alerts. For an explanation of how basic alerts concepts are related, see Concepts and workflow. alert condition An alert condition (or condition), identified by its unique numeric condition_id, contains the criteria for creating a violation. The condition includes the threshold that is set for a metric timeslice or a custom metric over time on a chosen target. For an explanation of how a condition relates to other basic alerts concepts, see Concepts and workflow. alert evaluation Streaming data is assessed on a set of aggregation windows to determine if an alert condition is violating or recovering. The aggregation window time is how long we'll collect data before running the NRQL query condition. The offset evaluation time is how long you want us to wait for late data before assessing it. If a window doesn't have any data points, it's treated as a gap for loss of signal. alert policy A collection of one or more conditions, one or more notification channels, and an Incident preference setting. If a condition contained within the policy opens a violation, an incident may be opened depending on the Incident preference setting. Notifications will then be sent to all channels attached to the policy. For an explanation of how a policy relates to other basic alerts concepts, see Concepts and workflow. apdex Apdex is an industry-standard way to measure users' satisfaction with the response time of an application or service. New Relic rates each response as Satisfied, Tolerated, or Frustrated, and uses these ratings to calculate an overall user satisfaction score. For more information, see Apdex: Measure user satisfaction. apdex_f The response time above which a transaction are rated frustrating. Defaults to four times apdex_t. Requests that complete in less than apdex_t are rated satisfied. Requests that take longer than apdex_t, but less than four times apdex_t (apdex_f), are tolerated. Any requests that take longer than apdex_f are rated frustrating. For more information, see Apdex: Measure user satisfaction. apdex_t The response time above which a transaction is considered tolerable. The default value is 0.5 seconds, but you can change this in your Apdex settings. Requests that complete in less than apdex_t are rated satisfied. Requests that take more than apdex_t, but less than apdex_f, are tolerated. Any requests that take longer than apdex_f are rated frustrating. For more information, see Apdex: Measure user satisfaction. API (application programming interface) New Relic offers a variety of APIs and SDKs. For more information, see the introduction to New Relic's APIs. APM New Relic's APM (application performance monitoring) provides monitoring of your web or non-web application's performance. APM supports apps using several programming languages. application For New Relic purposes, any program instrumented by New Relic. application ID Some New Relic solutions assign a monitored application a unique application ID, often shortened to app ID. When present, this ID is available in the UI. It is also reported as an attribute and can be queried. For how to determine this, see Find app ID. application name The name that New Relic combines with your license key to uniquely identify a particular app. For more information, see Name your application. Applied Intelligence (AI) Applied Intelligence (AI) helps you find, troubleshoot, and resolve problems more quickly. Specifically, it’s a hybrid machine learning engine that reduces alert noise, correlates incidents, and automatically detects anomalies. Applied Intelligence includes Alerts, Incident Intelligence, and Proactive Detection. attribute Attributes are key-value pairs attached to data objects reported to New Relic. Attributes add detail, and they're similar to tags or labels in other SaaS software. You can explore this data by querying or searching via the UI or by using the data dictionary. Examples: APM reports a Transaction event. This includes timing data for the transaction in a duration attribute, which might have a value of .002. Our Infrastructure Monitoring reports a ProcessSample event. This includes a variety of CPU usage attributes, including a cpuSystemPercent attribute, which might have a value of .01. Our Telemetry SDK reports a Metric data type for storing metrics, with attached attributes like metricName and newrelic.source. Some New Relic tools allow you to report custom attributes to enhance your monitoring. For more information about attributes in APM, see Agent attributes. availability monitoring See Types of Synthetics monitors. browser The New Relic UI supports most browsers. For more information, see Supported browsers. For our end-user browser monitoring tool, see Browser Monitoring. Browser monitoring A Real User Monitoring (RUM) solution that measures the speed and performance of your end users as they navigate to your site from different web browsers, devices, operating systems, and networks. background external See web external. child account See parent account. cloud-based integration New Relic offers cloud-based integrations with providers such as Amazon Web Services (AWS), Microsoft Azure, and Google Cloud Platform. collector The component that collects data from New Relic agents running on an app server, mobile device, or end-user browser. While the agent is installed on a user's app server, the collectors are centrally located in New Relic's data center. In order to contact the collector, the agent must be able to reach New Relic's domains and IP addresses. (The exact domain or IP depends on the New Relic monitoring tool.) The collector receives and interprets this data, and stores it in a database. The data is then retrieved and presented in the New Relic UI and by our various REST APIs. Command line interface (CLI) Our command line interface (CLI) is a tool you can use to build a New Relic application. This is the same tool our own engineers use. Go here for quick start instructions. Go to our Developer site for sample apps and guides. compute unit (CU) A unit of measurement that determines your pricing for some New Relic products governed by our original product-based pricing model. For more information, see Compute unit pricing. condition_id See alert condition. CPM (calls per minute) The number of calls your application receives each minute. This usually corresponds to the number of page views or external connections, and is usually the same as RPM (requests per minute). CPU burn The time consumed by code minus the wait time for a transaction. This is the time actually spent processing the transaction. It appears in the New Relic UI at the top of the transaction view for the agents that provide it (Ruby and PHP only). custom attribute A key-value pair added to a transaction or event in order to gain additional information about it. For more information, see custom attributes. custom dashboard A customizable dashboard with charts and tables that includes data from multiple New Relic data sources. For more information, see dashboards. custom event An event, in New Relic terms, is a data object with attached attributes. New Relic reports default event types, like Transaction and TransactionError. You can also create your own events. Events can be queried, and are used in some other features. You can generate custom events with APM agents, the browser monitoring agent, the mobile monitoring agents, and via the Event API. Alternatively, you can add custom attributes to some existing default New Relic events. custom instrumentation Custom instrumentation allows you to extend New Relic's monitoring to instrument code elements New Relic doesn't automatically instrument. Custom instrumentation is useful when your framework is not supported by New Relic, or when New Relic fails to pick up some element of your program. You can also use custom instrumentation to block a transaction from being reported entirely. For more information, see Custom instrumentation. custom metric Metric timeslice data that is manually recorded via an API call. Custom metrics allow you to record arbitrary metrics; for example, timing or computer resource data. All custom metric names must be prefixed with Custom/. For more information, see Custom metrics. Not to be confused with custom instrumentation data. data collector See collector. data explorer Use the data explorer to access, query and customize your data, create visualizations, and make connections between your services in a consistent and curated experience. For more on using the data explorer, see Introduction to the data explorer. degradation period When a data source enters a violating state, a degradation period of time begins. The degradation period is set in the condition's threshold. A violation will open if the source stays in a violating state for the entire degradation period. In addition: If the data source enters a non-violating state before the entire time has elapsed, the degradation period countdown is reset, and a violation does not open. If your alert condition threshold is configured as at least once in, the degradation period always lasts a single minute. dimensional metric A dimensional metric is a metric that has multiple attributes, also known as dimensions. At New Relic, we report dimensional metrics using the Metric data type. For more on other metric data types, see Metric data. Docker An open platform for distributed applications, which allows you to assemble multi-container portable apps. Infrastructure Monitoring includes integrated Docker monitoring. For more information about Docker, see the Docker website. downtime The period of time when customers cannot access your site and your app is not reporting to New Relic. For more information, see Synthetic Monitoring and Types of synthetic monitors. entity In New Relic, an entity is anything we can identify that has data you can monitor. An entity can be something you monitor directly, like applications and microservices, or indirectly, like data centers. You can identify one or more entities to be targets for alert conditions. In the Alerts API, the entity being monitored is identified with an entity_id. For more on this, see What are entities? event The word event is a general term that can have many meanings. At New Relic, event can have several meanings: At New Relic, event data is one of our core data types. Event data represents a record of a single event at a particular moment in time. Events can vary by type (for example, Transaction or Mobile, and will have associated attributes (for example, timestamp or transactionName). For more details, see Event data. For our infrastructure monitoring, the word event can be used to refer to important system and host activity. For example, a configuration change for a monitored host would be registered on Infrastructure's Events UI page. For alerts, the Events UI page displays a list of alerts-related incidents for your monitored entities. Events are reported for a violation opening and for closing. In some contexts, event can refer to any NRQL-queryable data type. For example, when you run a NRQL query, you will see a count of inspected events: this refers to a count of all data types queried. expected error An expected error is a common error that you don't want to affect your Apdex score or error rate. For more information, see Manage errors in APM. exporter At New Relic, an exporter is a type of integration that reports telemetry data to New Relic from a third-party (non-New Relic) telemetry tool. For examples, see Exporters, or search our integration quickstarts in New Relic I/O. Flex New Relic Flex is an application-agnostic, all-in-one infrastructure integration. With it, you can build your own integration that collects metric data from a wide variety of services, and that can instrument any app that exposes metrics over a standard protocol (HTTP, file, shell) in a standard format (for example, JSON or plain text) to the terminal. It's a recommended way to create a custom integration, because it doesn't require coding skills. framework A framework is a structured collection of pre-defined functions, into which an application builder inserts their own code to build their application. A framework is not the same as a library. While a library is a collection of functions you can call as needed, a framework is a skeleton for your application. The functions in that framework then call your functions. For more about the distinction between a framework and a library, see What is the difference between a framework and a library?. New Relic automatically instruments many common frameworks. For more about the frameworks New Relic supports, see the agent-specific documentation: C SDK supported frameworks Go supported frameworks Java supported frameworks .NET supported frameworks Node.js supported frameworks PHP supported frameworks Python supported frameworks Ruby supported frameworks harvest cycle The period of time between each connection from a New Relic agent to the collector. Between harvest cycles, an agent collects and caches data. At the end of the cycle an agent reports those data to the collector, then begins a new harvest cycle. health status indicator Some New Relic UI pages have a health status indicator appearing next to an index of monitored entities. This is a colored bar (generally green, yellow, red, or gray) indicating the status of your app or other entity monitored by New Relic. It also indicates whether the entity has any alert policies assigned to it and whether there are any policy violations. In general, the colored bar will be green, yellow, red, or gray to indicate the health status. Exceptions: Our REST API (v2) uses orange instead of yellow for the application's health and reporting status. Service maps use different criteria for reporting the health of a connection between an app and an external service not monitored by New Relic (for example, a third party API). host At New Relic, a host means one of the following: A physical machine is a hardware-based device with dedicated physical resources, including memory, processing, and storage. Each machine has its own OS which applications run on. A virtual machine (VM) is the software implementation of a physical machine that executes programs like a physical machine. One or more virtual machines can run on a physical machine. Each virtual machine has its own OS and allocated virtual machine resources such as RAM and CPU. A cloud instance is a type of virtual machine that is run in the public cloud. In this context, virtual machines and cloud instances are different from Java Virtual Machines (JVMs) and containers. host ID Each host identified by APM is assigned a host ID. This ID is used to uniquely identify it, and to retrieve data about that host via the REST API. For more information, see List host ID. ignored error An error that you have told the APM agent not to report to the collector. For more information, see Manage errors in APM. incident An incident is a collection of one or more violations of the conditions defined in an alert policy. An incident record includes all of the open and close time stamps for each violation, as well as chart snapshots of the data being evaluated around the time of each violation. You can view detailed information from the Incidents pages in the user interface. You can also select your preference for how we roll up violations into the incident. For an explanation of how an incident relates to other basic alerts concepts, see Concepts and workflow. Infrastructure monitoring By connecting changes in host performance to changes in your configuration, infrastructure monitoring provides real-time metrics and powerful analytics that reduce your mean-time-to-resolution (MTTR). Infrastructure is specifically designed for complex environments that need flexible, dynamic server monitoring, from a physical datacenter to thousands of Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) instances and other types of integrations. Insights Insights was the name for the New Relic product that previously governed the reporting of custom events, and the ability to query and chart your New Relic data. These features are now a fundamental part of the New Relic One platform and are no longer governed by the Insights product or name. To learn more about these features: Event API for reporting custom events Query and chart data For historical reasons, the word \"Insights\" is still used in some places. For example: For New Relic organizations on our original pricing model, Insights Pro is still the product name governing custom event data ingest and retention. Some APM agents still have Insights language in their codebase. For example, the Java agent custom_insights_events configuration. There is an API key called the Insights insert key. instance ID Each instance identified by New Relic is assigned a unique instance ID. Instance IDs are most commonly found for JVMs (Java Virtual Machines), but can exist for each agent. This ID is used to uniquely identify it, and to retrieve data about that instance via the REST API. For more information, see List instance IDs. instrumentation The collection of data from an application or host. When New Relic instruments a framework, it detects the methods and calls used by that framework, and intelligently groups them together. integration At New Relic, an integration refers to a solution that integrates with a specific technology (like a web framework or a type of database). All our integrations can be found as quickstarts in New Relic Instant Observability. interaction In our mobile monitoring, an interaction is a specific code path initiated by a user interaction (usually a button press). An interaction is the mobile equivalent of a transaction, and like a transaction an interaction can be traced and monitored. You can see much of the data included in an interaction in the BrowserInteraction event. interaction trace An interaction trace is a complete picture of a single interaction. With interaction traces, New Relic gives you much deeper visibility into a single slow interaction, which can help you understand a broader problem. Interaction traces are the mobile equivalent of a transaction trace. For more information, see Creating interactions (iOS) and Creating interactions (Android). inventory data Inventory data is information about the status or configuration of a service or host. Examples of inventory data include: Configuration settings Name of the host the service is on Amazon AWS region Port being used For more information, see Understand and use data. key transaction A web transaction that the user has marked as particularly important; for example, key business events (such as signups or purchase confirmations), or transactions with a high performance impact (such as searches). Key transactions have their own pages in the UI and other customized values. For more information, see Key transactions. launcher A launcher is a specific piece of code you can include when you create a New Relic One app. It creates the tile on the homepage that you click to launch the app. For more information, see the documentation about core UI components. log A log is a message about a system used to understand the activity of the system and to diagnose problems. For more information on how we use log data, see Log management. Log monitoring Our log management and monitoring features give you the tools to collect, process, explore, visualize, and alert on your log data using your existing log forwarder. With all of your log data in one place, you'll be able to make better decisions, detect and resolve problems more quickly, and see your logs in context to troubleshoot faster. Logs Our Logs feature is a scalable log management platform that allows you to connect your log data with the rest of your telemetry data. Pre-built plugins with some of the most common open-source logging tools make it simple to send your data from anywhere to New Relic. Logs in context Logs in context makes it easy to link to your log data with related data across the rest of our platform. Bringing all of this data together in a single tool allows you to quickly get to the root cause of an issue and find the log lines that you need to identify and resolve a problem. master account See parent account. metric A metric is a numeric measurement. Metric data is a broad category because there are several ways to make and report measurements. For more about how metrics are reported at New Relic, see New Relic data types. metric timeslice New Relic reports metrics in several ways. One variety of metric data is called metric timeslice data; this is the type of data used to generate many of the charts in APM, mobile monitoring, and browser monitoring (for more details, see metric timeslice data). Over time, metric timeslice data is aggregated into longer timeslice data records for more efficient storage. For more about how we aggregate this type of data, see Data aggregation. For how to query this type of data, see Query metric timeslice data. metric grouping issue A metric grouping issue occurs when an account sends too many differently named metric timeslice data points to New Relic, and those individual web transactions are not properly aggregated. For example, rather than a single /user/controlpanel/ metric name, you might see /user/controlpanel/alice, /user/controlpanel/bob, and /user/controlpanel/carol. For more information, see Metric grouping issues. minion The software that accepts monitor jobs from a private location. A minion is a packaged virtual appliance that runs in your hypervisor. For more information, see Private locations overview and install and configure private minions. Mobile monitoring Mobile monitoring allows you to monitor and manage the performance of your mobile apps on Android, iOS, tvOS, and other systems. Mobile monitoring provides end-to-end details, including crashes, throughput, HTTP requests, error traces, and more. Not to be confused with New Relic's own mobile apps for Android, iPhone, and iPad. monitor For our Synthetic Monitoring, a monitor ensures your website or API endpoint is available. For more information, see Adding and editing monitors. NerdGraph NerdGraph is our GraphQL API, an efficient and flexible query language that lets you request exactly the data you need, without over-fetching or under-fetching. NerdGraph calls get all the data you need in a single request. NerdGraph also makes it easier to evolve APIs over time and enables powerful developer tools. You can use our NerdGraph GraphiQL explorer to explore the schema and find definitions. With valid New Relic API key, you can try it out yourself at api.newrelic.com/graphiql. Nerdlet A Nerdlet is a component of a New Relic One application. It's a specific UI view, represented by a React JavaScript package. For more information, see Nerdpack file structure. Nerdpack A Nerdpack is a component of a New Relic One application. It's the package containing all the files needed by that application. For more information, see Nerdpack file structure. New Relic Edge with Infinite Tracing New Relic Edge with Infinite Tracing is a fully managed, distributed tracing service that observes 100% of your application traces, then provides actionable data so you can solve issues faster. For more information, see /docs/understand-dependencies/distributed-tracing/get-started/how-new-relic-distributed-tracing-works. New Relic One For more information, see Introduction to New Relic One. New Relic One catalog Our catalog is a collection of applications built on the New Relic One platform. The catalog includes custom apps we've built, public open source apps, and any apps that you buid. You can browse the catalog on New Relic One. NRQL (New Relic query language) NRQL is a query language, similar in form to SQL, that allows you to query the data stored in your New Relic account. non-web transaction APM identifies transactions as either web or non-web. When New Relic does not detect a transaction was initiated by a web request, this is called a non-web transaction. For more information, see Background processes and other non-web transactions. notification The message sent when an incident opens, is acknowledged, or closes. The type of notification is defined by the alert policy's notification channel. For an explanation of how notifications relate to other basic alerts concepts, see Concepts and workflow. notification channel Where we send a notification when an incident opens, is acknowledged, or closes. Available channels include email, mobile push notifications, webhooks, and more. on-host integration On-host integrations refer to integrations that reside on your own servers or hosts and that communicate with our infrastructure agent. For more information, see Introduction to on-host integrations. owner For accounts on our original pricing model, this is a type of user role: the user who initially created the account. For more information, see Users. page load timing With page load timing, New Relic monitors the full load time for end-user browsers. New Relic's application agents dynamically inject JavaScript into the page, then capture the following key load points: Navigation start: The user initiates the transaction. First byte: The browser receives the requested page. DOM ready: The browser has finished parsing DOM. Page ready: Page loading is complete. Page load timing is sometimes referred to as RUM, or real user monitoring. Unlike standard RUM, page load timing also captures JavaScript errors and AJAX requests. For more information, see Page load timing process. parameter Deprecated term; see attribute. parent account New Relic organizations can have a parent/child account structure. This structure was much more important for organizations on our original user model, but is still used for some features for organizations on the New Relic One user model. Learn more about account structure. Parent accounts were previously referred to as \"master accounts\", and child accounts were previously referred to as \"sub-accounts\". permalink A unique URL that links to a view of your application at a specific point in time. Permalinks are useful for troubleshooting and for sharing interesting time windows with colleagues. pinger The component of New Relic that connects to your website to verify your website is accessible. New Relic has pingers in Europe, Asia, and the United States. Each pinger attempts to contact your website at least once every two minutes. If enough pingers are unable to reach your website, your application will be considered down. For in-depth scriptable testing, including real browser tests and tests of API endpoints, see Synthetic Monitoring. Synthetic Monitoring includes free ping monitoring, which allows you to monitor your website from locations around the world. For more information, see Types of Synthetic monitors. polling interval (AWS) Our Amazon integrations query your AWS services according to a polling interval, which varies depending on the integration. Each polling interval occurs for every AWS entity. For example, if you have thirteen Elastic Load Balancers (ELB), each one will be polled every five minutes. Depending on the AWS integration, there may be delays in the timing between the API request and the metric data returned. If you notice unusual delays, follow the integration troubleshooting procedures. PPM (pages per minute) The number of pages per minute your application serves. private location A Synthetic monitor feature that allows you to run Synthetic monitors from within your own systems by creating private minions. Private locations allow you to extend your Synthetic coverage to new geographical locations, and to monitor websites behind your firewall such as an intranet site. For more information, see Private locations overview. recovery period A recovery period of time begins when a data source enters a non-violating state after being in a violating state. The recovery period is set in the condition's threshold. A violation will close when a source remains in a non-violating state and the recovery period time has elapsed. If the data source enters a violating state before the time has elapsed, the recovery period clock will reset and the violation won't close. response time The duration of time between a request for service and a response. For more information, see Response time. restricted user A type of user role on a New Relic account. For more information, see Users. rollup Using the same application name for multiple applications. This allows you to combine data in APM, either from multiple applications, or from multiple instances of an application. For more information, see Rolling up app data. root span For distributed tracing, the root span is the first span in a trace. In many cases, the root span duration will represent the duration of the entire trace, or be very close to it. However, for more complex, modern systems that use a lot of asynchronous, non-blocking processes, this will not be true. For those systems, the root span’s duration may be significantly less than the duration of the trace. RPM The term RPM usually refers to the number of requests per minute your application receives from users. This is usually the same as CPM (calls per minute). Historically, some New Relic monitoring solutions, like APM and Browser Monitoring, used to contain RPM in the URL; for example, https://rpm.newrelic.com. This language use originally referred to Rails performance management because the first iteration of our product monitored Ruby on Rails applications. We monitor many more languages and systems than Ruby now. RUM (real user monitoring) See page load timing. runbook A runbook contains standard procedures and operations typically used by system administrators, network operations staff, and other personnel to handle outages, alert incidents, and other situations. If your organization stores runbook instructions as URLs, you can link this information to an alerts policy so your personnel has easy access to this information when an incident violates the defined policy thresholds. SAML (Security Assertion Markup Language) SAML is an XML-based data format for sharing authentication data between two parties. New Relic accounts must obtain a SAML certificate in order to enable Single Sign On for their users. For more information, see SAML service providers. Selenium Selenium is an open-source browser testing suite. Synthetics uses Selenium to test monitored websites with real browsers. For more information, see monitor types. service A service is a cluster of runtime server processes that accomplish a particular task, usually service requests. Unlike an application, a service is not usually invoked by a human. New Relic offers a variety of integrations that allow you to report data from your services. signal The stream of telemetry data that's watched and alerted on. You use NRQL queries to define a signal. signal filter When we receive data and it's routed to the streaming alerts platform, your NRQL WHERE clause will filter the data coming in. The filtered streaming data is what's evaluated for loss of signal violations, for example. span In a distributed trace, a span is a \"named, timed operation representing a contiguous segment of work in that trace\" (from OpenTracing.io definition). For distributed tracing, spans are displayed in the distributed tracing UI, and the data type Span is available to be queried. See also root span. SSL certificate SSL certificates encrypt data that is being transmitted. While New Relic refers to security certificates as SSL because it is a more commonly used term, all certificates adhere to industry standards for secure encryption in transit. SSO (single sign on) SSO (single sign on) allows you to manage user authentication in New Relic using an external SSO provider. For more information, see Setting up SSO. streaming algorithm This is what determines when the data in an aggregation window is processed. The streaming algorithm uses your server's clock time and the aggregation window size to trigger the alert evaluation process. sub-accounts See master account. Synthetic monitoring Synthetic monitoring allows you to monitor your website or API endpoint via automated, scriptable tools. Use free ping monitor to ensure your website is accessible, or expand your monitoring with browser monitors, which test your website with real browsers. Go further with scripting, to script browsers or API monitors for sophisticated testing. target A target is a resource or component monitored by a New Relic monitoring tool that has been identified in an alert condition. When the data source for that target crosses the defined critical threshold, we will open a violation. Depending on your policy's Incident preference setting, Alerts may create an incident record and send notifications through the defined channels. See also entity. tag Tags are key:value metadata added to monitored apps, hosts, dashboards, and other entities to help you organize your data at a high level. For details, see Tags. thresholds Thresholds are alert condition settings that define a violation. Threshold values include the value a data source must pass to trigger a violation and the time-related settings that define a violation; for example: Passing a certain value for at least x minutes Passing a certain value only once in x minutes While the data source passes a certain value, a degradation period starts. Likewise, when that data source stops passing a certain value, a recovery period starts. The durations of these two time periods are defined in the alert condition threshold settings. Thresholds have a required critical (red) threshold and an optional warning (yellow) threshold. In the UI, the entity's health status indicator will change to yellow or red when a threshold has been crossed and a violation will open. For more information, see Define thresholds. For an explanation of how thresholds relate to other basic Alerts concepts, see Concepts and workflow. throughput Throughput is a measurement of user activity for a monitored application. APM throughput and Browser Monitoring throughput are measured in different ways: APM: requests per minute (RPM) Browser: page views per minute (PPM) tier A tier can refer to how New Relic categorizes or visualizes the various agent language ecosystems that we support. For example: In APM, the color-coded categories that appear on your app's main Overview chart show response time spent in various functions, processes, or agents as tiers; for example, request queuing, garbage collection, Middleware, JVMs, etc. In New Relic labels, TIER can be used to define or classify the client-server architecture; for example, front-end and back-end tiers. \"Tier\" may sometimes be used to refer to our pricing editions. time picker By default the New Relic UI shows data for the past 30 minutes, ending now. To change the time window, use the time picker. time range A time range can refer to a length of time selected in the New Relic UI. New Relic displays a time range depending on the range you select using the time picker. timeslice data See metric timeslice data. trace A trace is a description of how a request travels through a system. Trace data helps you understand the performance of your system and diagnose problems. For more information on how we use trace data, see New Relic data types. traffic light See health status. transaction A transaction is defined as one logical unit of work in an application. This term primarily refers to server-side transactions monitored by APM. For more information, see documentation about web transactions and non-web transactions. The term transaction is also sometimes used in Browser Monitoring. In that case, it primarily refers to activity beginning with a browser-side web request and ending with a complete page load. transaction trace A transaction trace is a complete picture of a single transaction, down to the database queries and exact invocation patterns. With transaction traces, New Relic gives you much deeper visibility into a single slow transaction, which can help you understand a broader problem. For more information, see Transaction traces. UI The New Relic user interface. For more information, see Standard page functions. user A user can refer to a specific user role in a New Relic account. For more information, see Users. UTC Universal Time Coordinated (UTC), or Coordinated Universal Time, is a standard timestamp for synchronizing time around the world. value function (metrics) The numeric value obtained from metric timeslice data; for example, an average, minimum, maximum, total, sample size, etc. violation A violation occurs when the entity monitored by an alert condition reports a value that crosses the thresholds defined in that condition. For an explanation of how violations relate to other basic alerts concepts, see Concepts and workflow. You can view a summary of the violations for a selected incident's page. You can also view the violations for a specific entity from the product's UI. web external Web external is the term applied to the portion of time spent in transactions to external applications from within the code of the application you are monitoring. That time can be a call to a third party company (a payment provider, for example) or it could be a call to another microservice within your own company. Web external demonstrates how performance is impacted by your code executing outside the application you are measuring. web transaction A transaction is defined as one logical unit of work in an application. This term primarily refers to server-side transactions monitored by APM. Web transactions are initiated with an HTTP request. For most organizations, these represent customer-centric interactions and thus are the most important transactions to monitor. For more information, see Web transactions and Non-web transactions. WebDriverJS WebDriver is a Selenium component, used to control Synthetics scripted browsers. Specifically, Synthetics uses WebDriverJS, a Node.js-based flavor of Selenium. For more information, see Writing scripted browsers and Scripted browser examples. workload A workload represents a group of entities that work together to provide a digital service. For more information, see Workloads.",

      "body": "New Relic's global data hosting structure consists of two regions: the European Union (EU) region and the United States (US) region. Selecting your preferred region during the account setup process allows you to specify the region where your performance monitoring data will be hosted. You can also create accounts in each region. Requirements Access to the New Relic EU region requires the latest agent version. For new customers: Install the most recent agent version. For existing customers: Update to the most recent agent version. Minimum agent version required: C SDK 1.0.0 or higher Go 2.0.0 or higher Java 4.0.0 or higher .NET 8.0.0 or higher Node.js 3.0.0 or higher PHP 8.0.0.204 or higher Python 3.0.0.89 or higher Ruby 5.0.0.342 or higher Regions and availability Your choice of data center is not limited by your geographic location. You can choose to create an account with data hosted in either the EU or US region, regardless of where you or your systems reside. You can also create accounts in each region. New Relic offers almost all the same active products, features, support offerings, and performance levels in the EU region as what is offered in the US region. Exceptions: The following are not supported with an EU region account: Infinite Tracing is not available. APM's weekly performance reports are not available. Errors inbox is not available. Log patterns Deprecated products and features are not available. New Relic's Incident Intelligence service operates solely in the US whether you store your data in New Relic’s US region data center or New Relic’s EU region data center, by using New Relic Incident Intelligence, you consent that New Relic may move and store your data in the US region. New Relic CodeStream operates solely in the US. Whether you have selected New Relic's US or EU region data center during setup of your New Relic account, when using New Relic CodeStream, you consent that your New Relic CodeStream data will get stored in the US. Regions and account hierarchy You can create accounts in each region. If your data is currently being hosted in the US region, you must create a new account to store data in the EU region. You cannot view EU data from a US account, or US data from an EU account. The data collected remains separate. The data cannot be aggregated or migrated between accounts. For organizations that have a parent/child account structure, you can only have one parent account. For more, see Manage apps or users with child accounts. For partnership accounts, no changes to the partnership owner account are required. However, data cannot be shared across regions, so a partnership requires a parent account for each region. Hierarchy example for partnership accounts With partnership accounts, a new parent account must be created for any data to be host in the EU region. This hierarchy illustrates how global accounts are structured with partnership owner accounts. Data is not aggregated beyond the parent account. Example hierarchy for partnership organizations. Because data cannot be shared across regions, a partnership will require a parent account for each region. Create an EU region account To create a New Relic account in the EU region: Go to the New Relic signup page. OR If you have a specific offer from a New Relic partner, follow that link directly. Follow the online steps to create your account. From the Select your region dropdown, select European Union. Agree to the Terms of Service. When you receive an email confirmation message, select the link to confirm your account and sign in to New Relic. Then install or update to the most recent agent version. API endpoints for EU region accounts If you have an EU region account, use the appropriate endpoints to access the following New Relic APIs: API EU endpoint Browser source maps API sourcemaps.service. eu .newrelic.com Copy Infrastructure Alert API infra-api. eu .newrelic.com Copy Dashboard API rpm. eu .newrelic.com/api/explore/dashboards/list Copy Insert API insights-collector. eu01 .nr-data.net Copy Insights Query API insights-api. eu .newrelic.com Copy Mobile apps rpm. eu .newrelic.com/mobile Copy NerdGraph GraphiQL API api. eu .newrelic.com/graphiql Copy Partner API The partner API is a global API with no regional data differences. Use this endpoint for both EU and US accounts: rpm.newrelic.com/api/v2/partners/ Copy REST API api. eu .newrelic.com Copy Synthetics API synthetics. eu .newrelic.com/synthetics/api Copy Trace API trace-api. eu .newrelic.com/trace/v1 Copy Metric API metric-api. eu .newrelic.com/metric/v1 Copy Log API log-api. eu .newrelic.com/log/v1 Copy Access New Relic One If your accounts report data to the EU data center, use the following link to go to New Relic One: one.eu.newrelic.com. Billing and pricing New Relic's account billing process and pricing options are the same for both the EU and US regions. Operational access and processing Customer Data is hosted in the region selected during account creation. Systems Operations Data is stored in the US region. All other information, including account information (such as license subscription information, billing, and internal monitoring) is hosted in the US region and replicated in the EU region. New Relic may access and process Customer Data in the United States and such other jurisdictions where New Relic has affiliates and subsidiaries, including as may be necessary to maintain, secure, or perform the services, to provide technical support, or as necessary to comply with law or a binding order of a government body. Customer Data from existing New Relic accounts cannot be transferred or shared across regions, and new data generated cannot be shared with existing accounts, even in partnership accounts. Verify your account is based in EU region Use either of these options to verify whether your account data is hosted in the EU region's data center: In APM, mouse over the application name to view the URL. If it begins with rpm.eu.newrelic.com/, it is an EU-based account. Check your New Relic license key. If it begins with EU, it is an EU-based account.",

      "body": "At New Relic, we support our customers by continually improving our Software as a Service (SaaS) features and distributed software. Sometimes that means we introduce changes that can include moving away from existing software components and features, called end-of-life (EOL). As we make these decisions, we strive to balance the need to introduce improvements with our customer’s tolerance for change. We do our best to anticipate the impact of these changes for our customers. What we communicate We're committed to communicating about the changes that impact user experience, especially when these changes have a significant effect on workflow. In assessing impact we evaluate: Potential impact to customer workflow Feature usage information Customer feedback In communicating changes, we strive to: Give as much lead time as possible Minimize interruption Provide a documented alternative Lead time for notifications EOL changes are classified into the following categories: Transition impact Description Notification lead time Low Limited changes to customer processes or procedures are anticipated. None to 90 days Moderate Changes to functionality are limited in scope. Actions such as upgrading retired agents to supported versions may be required. Minimum of 90 days High Changes are highly impactful to customers and will require significant investment from customers to adapt. Minimum of 180 days Critical A third party dependency, security issue, or other critical risk causes an urgent need to change or remove functionality on an accelerated timeline. Notified as soon as reasonably practical EOL lead times: impact on distributed software Subject to EOL lead times: Our lead time notifications also apply to distributed software, which is software developed by New Relic that is installed on customer-owned systems. Distributed software is not cloud-based, and has a lifespan from the date of each released version. After that date, it may cease to function or stop reporting data to New Relic. We have fully open sourced many of our distributed software projects as community projects. We also participate in many community-led software development projects. If we have not open sourced our software projects, or if we have designated them as Community Plus projects, the following timeframes apply to them: Released on or after October 1, 2020: These projects will be compatible with our SaaS offering for at least two years after the date of publishing the release. Released prior to October 1, 2020: These projects will be compatible for at least three years after the date of publishing the release. All fixes and security updates are provided in the latest released version of distributed software, and we encourage our customers to keep installed software up to date. In the event a released version of software will cease normal function sooner than two (or three) years, New Relic will follow the EOL process. EOL lead times not applicable: Some of our distributed software have been open sourced, are designated as such, and are available at github.com/newrelic, including: Community projects New Relic One catalog Example code New Relic experimental Archived Our EOL policy does not apply to these projects, which is why we do not provide advance EOL notification for them.

      "body": "A DevOps transformation requires a cultural shift so that teams can build new skills and motivations for the type of cross-team work required in a true DevOps practice. The transformation can be difficult when the people involved do not see the benefits of change as a clear objective. Service level objectives (SLOs) provide a powerful mechanism to codify the goals of a DevOps team in a way that can be measured and shared. They also provide clear boundaries on service expectations that help teams achieve greater velocity and freedom in experimenting with new approaches. This tutorial defines SLOs for successful service delivery objectives and utilize New Relic instrumentation to surface the current performance metrics relative to those objectives. Measurable SLOs and visibility into your current progress against those SLOs ensure that you will be able to properly assess future optimization efforts. See also our service level management feature. Service level components An SLO is an agreed upon means of measuring the performance of your service. The SLO defines a target value of a specified quantitative measure, which is called a service level indicator (SLI); for example: Average response time Response time percentile Application availability SLOs clarify a target value for SLIs; for example: Average response time should be less than 200 ms 95% of requests should be completed within 250 ms Availability of the service should be 99.99% Logically group SLOs together to provide an overall boolean indicator of whether or not the service is meeting expectations. For example, a helpful SLO for alerting purposes could be: 95% of requests completed within 250 ms AND availability is 99.99% Copy Service level components Example values SLI (Indicator) HTTP status codes SLO (Objective) < 1% HTTP 500s over 30 days SLA (Agreement) For every additional .1% of HTTP 500s, 5% refund of total contract Resources Value stream mapping can be a useful exercise to work through before setting SLOs. Work with your teams to clarify key components of your service and the appropriate metrics. Use these inputs as starting points for this tutorial. In addition: Learn about SLOs, SLIs, and SLAs from the Google Cloud Platform blog. Learn how New Relic has applied SLOs and SLIs into its reliability practices form this SREcon18 Americas presentation (approximately 21 minutes). 1. Build an inventory of services requiring SLOs Start defining SLOs for your application by first taking an inventory of the services that your application provides to both your internal and external customers. Draft a list of services. Make the scope of services you consider as comprehensive as possible. Engage your team members and other stakeholders to validate the list for completeness. Segment your application stack to understand the potential components that might require SLOs. For example, most applications can be segmented as: Application (backend/microservices) Dependency services (such as the message queue) Database Website Underlying servers This example lists components that would benefit from SLOs: Customer type Component name Owner Language stack Operating system External Service 1 John D. Java RHEL 6 Internal Service 2 Jane A. .NET Win2003 R2 Internal ActiveMQ John D. Java AIX External Website Jane A. Classic ASP Win2000 Internal MS SQL Dave Z. n/a Win2003 R2 Building a definitive list of services that require an SLO can be challenging, because an application often consists of many endpoints with complex interdependencies. Begin your SLO journey with pragmatism. Start by defining a broader, simpler set of SLOs that are driven by what your customers care about most and what your team can control. As your teams better align around SLOs, you can then begin to fine-tune and add more complexity. 2. Research customer expectations for SLOs Once you have an inventory of services, begin to gather the information you need to define the SLOs for those services. Interviews with customers that depend on your services are often valuable for understanding service expectations. For example, to define SLOs for internal teams, New Relic, ask questions such as: If possible, can you broadly categorize the types of requests we can expect from you and your service? To what extent do you or your service depend on timely responses to requests? Are there requests for which response time is not critical? How does your service handle unavailable dependencies or data? What is the maximum amount of unavailable data that your service can handle? At what threshold does your service fail if a request takes too long? What are acceptable rates of errors? What would a SLA look like between our product and yours? Existing usage data can also be a helpful research input. 3. Define SLOs Using the research on customer expectations that you gathered, draft a focused set of SLOs. New Relic recommends setting SLOs against one or more of the following SLIs: Application availability percentage Average response time Response percentile Error rate Apdex value Also, consider instrumenting and tracking the following SLIs: Throughput (peak and trough) Database call count and duration DNS and SSL timing DOM processing and page rendering Mean-time-to-detection (MTTD) For a more comprehensive list of potential areas to measure, see Measuring DevOps. Recommendation: To determine if your application is performing to customer expectations: Consider combining multiple SLIs (for example, availability and response time) into one SLO. Aim to define a consistent set of conditions across all of the services in your list. Consult your team and stakeholders to validate that the SLOs you set are reasonable, consistently attainable (even if you are not currently meeting them), and aligned to customer expectations. After you finish this step, you should have a set of well-defined SLOs and SLIs. 4. Determine what can be instrumented Now you're ready to deploy agents or monitors to establish a performance baseline for the SLIs you created. With proper instrumentation in place, you'll have visibility into the performance indicators that matter for your team and your customers. In addition, you'll also have a clear understanding of how to meet your SLOs. Identify the service components your team will optimize. Verify which application tiers meet New Relic monitoring requirements. To ensure you have robust baselines from which to work, determine the level of instrumentation that is possible (or allowed) within your organization. It's best practice to instrument everything you can, but there may be situations where instrumentation isn't viable. In that case, you should determine what other data is available or can be created. For example, you can gather logs to query them for SLO data and set alerts for them. one.newrelic.com > Logs: Use the New Relic log management UI to leverage your logs. If the application has a web front end in these situations, use New Relic synthetic monitors. Our synthetic monitors offer non-agent monitoring while still providing the ability to establish a baseline. To instrument the example applications and components in this tutorial, use these New Relic features: New Relic products Customer type Component name Tier owner Language stack Server OS New Relic products External Service 1 John D. Java RHEL 6 APM, infrastructure monitoring, synthetic monitors Internal Service 2 Jane A. .Net Win2003 R2 APM, infrastructure monitoring Internal ActiveMQ John D. Java AIX APM External Website Jane A. Classic ASP Win2000 Synthetic monitors Internal MS SQL Dave Z. NA Win2003 R2 Infrastructure monitoring, on-host integrations APM installation After reviewing the compatibility and requirements for APM, install an APM agent on your application stack. Steps for installing APM agents vary based on language agent type. Follow the install procedures for a specific APM agents. Infrastructure installation After reviewing the requirements for New Relic infrastructure monitoring, follow the install procedures to install the infrastructure agent on instances that host your applications. The infrastructure agent requires the following host permissions: Linux: To install and run the agent, you must have root privileges. Windows: To install and run the agent, you must have Administrator privileges. Infrastructure on-host integrations To gain extended visibility into applications that your code depends on, deploy on-host integrations based on their availability. New Relic supports several commonly used application components, including MySQL, Apache, NGINX, and more. For more information, see our on-host integration docs. Synthetics New Relic synthetic monitoring gives you a suite of automated, scriptable tools to monitor your websites, critical business transactions, and API endpoints. Follow the procedures to create a simple browser check. Be sure to verify that your website URL is accessible from the Synthetics public network locations. Browser monitoring New Relic browser monitoring provides deep insights into how your users are interacting with your application or website. Browser monitoring complements synthetic monitors with data based on actual user experiences, which is useful in discerning how DevOps efforts are ultimately improving the experience for the customer. For more information, see the compatibility and requirements, then install the New Relic browser agent. Mobile monitoring The growing role of mobile apps in customer experience often spurs new performance data needs. Installation of New Relic mobile monitoring lets DevOps teams instrument iOS and Android applications to gain a fuller understanding of service delivery quality. 5. Review the default metrics After you deploy the agents and monitors, use service maps to review the default metrics that New Relic captures. For example, a typical service map show many of the common SLIs that application teams rely on, including response time, Apdex, throughput, and error rate metrics from APM. It also shows page load time, Ajax response, throughput, and error rate from browser monitoring. 6. Set up custom instrumentation To close any remaining gaps in visibility for your SLIs, use custom instrumentation. New Relic provides several avenues for adding custom instrumentation, including: Making API calls to agents from inside your source code Packaging XML-based custom instrumentation modules with deployed applications Adding UI-based instrumentation without a code deploy In addition, you can add custom attributes to each transaction event that match application performance factors to critical business information. Then you can track those attributes in Insights dashboards. For more information, see the custom instrumentation documentation for your application: APM Browser Infrastructure Mobile Synthetics 7. Create dashboards to track SLIs Once you implement the appropriate instrumentation, it's easy to visualize your service level indicators with New Relic dashboards, which provide a single location to query and view all the data that New Relic tools gather. To learn more about how to run queries to produce charts and dashboards, see Introduction to query builder. For more about the data you can query, see New Relic data types. The metrics you capture will become your application's baseline. Share dashboards with your application team and stakeholders to provide visibility into what is happening with your application and to monitor future performance.",

      "body": "This tutorial covers methods to identify and track the key indicators of customer experience and clarifies the effect of application performance on your business. A clear understanding of what creates successful customer experience helps DevOps teams drive greater efficiencies in work efforts and deliver greater productivity. An efficient, well-functioning DevOps culture enables organizations to make rapid, frequent releases and product changes. A strong DevOps culture also democratizes data beyond the typical backend users, and makes it available to groups like customer service, support, sales, and marketing. However, this data information enablement is only useful if its purpose is to improve and optimize customer experience. Prerequisites This tutorial assumes you’ve reviewed the Establish team dashboards tutorial. 1. Use custom attributes to associate performance data In order to relate performance data to user experience, you need to capture information that ties a particular user or customer to the front- and back-end transactions that are responsible for their interactions with your application. In New Relic, you collect this data with custom attributes. Tip If you plan to collect this information in both frontend and backend, be sure to forward custom attributes from APM to browser. Here are some common attributes to collect: User ID Organization or customer ID A/B testing cohort value High-value customer indicator Purchase value or product IDs (for e-commerce) If you’ve completed the Iterate and measure impact or Establish objectives and baselines tutorials, consider what service level objectives (SLOs) or key metrics you defined in those stages. New Relic recommends including attributes like the above to measure the impact of your changes and optimizations at a customer level—not only a performance level. 2. Create dashboards with performance and business metrics Using the attributes collected in Step 1, build dashboards to examine the impact of performance issues on your users. Additionally, to drive visibility across your teams, add dedicated widgets to the team dashboards you built in the Establish team dashboards . insights.newrelic.com > Dashboards For example, if you were collecting a custom username attribute, you could use NRQL queries like these to create your widgets for your New Relic Insights dashboard: Number of errors by username: SELECT count(*) FROM TransactionError FACET username Copy Median response time by username: SELECT percentile(duration,50) FROM Transaction FACET username Copy Total purchase value in transactions with errors: SELECT sum(purchaseTotal) FROM TransactionError FACET username Copy Tip If you include a FACET clause in your queries, you'll be able to click into metric results to see corresponding change in the performance data. For more information on faceting, see Linking Between Dashboards to Drill Into Your Data. 3. Share dashboards across departments Dashboards, data, and metrics that nobody looks at or knows about might as well not exist. When considering how, or with whom, to share your dashboards, consider the following questions: Which teams are responsible for applications that have high levels of end-user interaction? What non-engineering teams could benefit from this information? Customer support: Could customer issues be resolved faster? Product/engineering: Could product make more informed roadmap decisions? Customer success: Can this data be used to make our customers more successful? Are there other teams that can benefit from cohort analysis that includes performance metrics? 4. Utilize data to separate performance by cohort and debug issues at the customer level After you create your dashboards, use them to scope issues affecting particular customers or sets of customers. For example, the following widget shows which apps have errors for a particular user: Use attributes that track user and performance to set alerts on high priority users or customers. For example, you could include a WHERE clause in your NRQL queries to scope the results to a set of user IDs or customer IDs. Set alerts on any performance or business metric that is tied to these attributes.",

      "body": "BETA FEATURE This feature is currently in beta. With New Relic you can implement service levels for your applications, consume the results easily from the UI during your planning sessions and incident response, and progressively iterate on the configuration to adjust your objectives to the desired user experience. Besides the UI, you can also use our NerdGraph API Explorer to create and edit of SLIs and their SLOs. Alternatively, you can automate this configuration using the Terraform Service Level resource. Important In order to create service levels, the API key needs a role with permissions to modify and delete metric rules. Create an SLI with an SLO Please refer to Create and edit SLIs and SLOs to learn the basic concepts in the SLI and SLO configuration, such as the entity that an SLI is associated with. Also, you can refer to that documentation to find examples of the most common indicators for APM services and browser applications. The following is an example NerdGraph call that creates an SLI using the serviceLevelCreate mutation query: mutation { serviceLevelCreate( entityGuid: \"entityGuid\", indicator: { name: \"Latency below 0.25 seconds\", description: \"The proportion of valid requests that were served faster than 0.25s, which is considered to correspond to a good experience.\", events: { validEvents: { from: \"Transaction\", where: \"entityGuid = 'entityGuid'\" }, goodEvents: { from: \"Transaction\", where: \"entityGuid = 'entityGuid' and duration < 0.25\" }, accountId: accountId}, objectives: { target: 99.5, timeWindow: { rolling: { count: 7, unit: DAY }}}}) { id description } } Copy It contains these fields: entityGuid: The GUID of the entity (for example, APM service, browser application, etc.) that you want to relate this SLI to. On the UI, you can find this GUID on the entity page, under See metadata and manage tags. description: Use detailed descriptions, including the selected threshold that determines good events. For example, for an availability SLI, include something like “The proportion of valid requests that were served without errors.” Or, for a latency SLI, include a description such as “The proportion of valid requests that were served faster than 0.25s, which is considered to correspond to a good experience”. accountId: The ID of the account where the APM service or browser application belongs to, which contains the NRDB data for the SLI/SLO calculations. badEvents.from, badEvents.where The NRQL query that defines bad events, SELECT count(*) FROM badEvents.from WHERE badEvents.where, requires these FROM and WHERE clauses. If you defined an SLI from valid and bad events, leave the goodEvents object empty. goodEvents.from, goodEvents.where The NRQL query that defines good events, SELECT count(*) FROM goodEvents.from WHERE goodEvents.where, requires these FROM and WHERE clauses. If you defined an SLI from valid and good events, leave the badEvents object empty. validEvents.from, validEvents.where These are the FROM and WHERE clauses for the NRQL query that defines valid events, which will result in SELECT count(*) FROM validEvents.from WHERE validEvents.where. name: A short category name for your SLI to help understand what the Service Level is about. We suggest including any specific parameters and filters involved in the SLI definition. Examples: Availability Latency below 4 seconds CLS for desktops below 0.1 objectives: An array of objectives (SLOs) for the SLI. target: The target for your SLO, up to 100.00. The field supports up to 5 decimals. If your users are happy with the current experience, set the SLO percentage to match the current baseline. For instance, the percentile used to determine the SLI's good events. timeWindow.rolling.count: The length of the period taken into consideration to calculate the SLO. The supported values are 1, 7, 14, 28, and 30. timeWindow.rolling.unit: DAYis the supported value. Retrieve the configuration of an SLI for an APM service Use this query to retrieve the configuration of an SLI, including its id. { actor { entity(guid: \"entityGuid\") { guid name serviceLevel { indicators { createdAt createdBy { email } description entityGuid id name objectives { target timeWindow { rolling { count unit } } } } } } } } Copy Update the SLOs of an SLI Use the serviceLevelUpdate mutation to define one or more SLOs for each one of the SLIs. To obtain the SLI's id, use the query above. mutation { serviceLevelUpdate( id: \"indicators.id\", indicator: { objectives: { target: 99.00, timeWindow: { rolling: { count: 7, unit: DAY }}}}) { id } } Copy",
