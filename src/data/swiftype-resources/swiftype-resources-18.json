For more information on related features, see our docs on Alerts notification channels, Incident Intelligence destinations, and Proactive Detection notifications. Alerts and Applied Intelligence notification integrations are specific services and platforms you can use to send notifications from New Relic. Integration details Read more about each of our specific notification integrations. Atlassian Jira Integrate New Relic with Atlassian Jira(Cloud) and automatically create and update Jira issues. Permissions The required permissions from the Jira API-Token are create, edit, and close tickets. To enable the two-way sync toggle, the provided Jira API-Key should have an Admin role. Set up a Jira destination Create Jira issues, then enable Jira and New Relic to share updates and stay synced. To create a Jira destination, enter the following information: Destination name: Custom name to identify the destination Jira account endpoint: the URL of the destination User-name: this will be the email address of the user making the connection API token: generated from your Atlassian account Important New Relic currently supports Atlassian-Jira Classic (company-managed) projects. Before saving the destination, we recommend you test the connection via the test connection button. Jira destination configuration. We recommand to test the connection before saving. Two-way sync You can enable a two-way integration with Jira to keep the issues' state synced with the corresponding state in New Relic. To enable two-way sync, turn on the ‘two-way integration’ toggle. When turned on, a Jira Webhook would be created in your Jira account at a later stage, for the selected project (see ‘customize a message template’). The webhook would contain access details to Newrelic (URL and Newrelic-API-KEY) Configure the message template To configure a template for a Jira issue, you first need to choose a destination. You will be able to create a new destination at this stage. Upon successful connection to the destination, you will need to choose a project, and then select the Jira issue type you would like to be used. Once the issue-type is selected, the configured project's fields are fetched from your account and automatically mapped to your Jira instance. To help you get started, we automatically present the required and recommended fields and values. Required fields must be set with a value. You can add or remove optional fields(use the X mark on their right side) Jira message template. Send a test notification You can see how the JIRA issue will appear by clicking a test notification with default field values. If successful, a JIRA issue will be created and a link will appear. ServiceNow (Incident-Management) Integrate New Relic with ServiceNow Incident-Management and automatically create and update incidents. Roles As part of the integrations, we fetch fields from the your serviceNow incident table and optional values. For this, the provided ServiceNow user details required read permissions for the tables: sys_dictionary, sys_choice, sys_user and task. A read/write permission to incident To be able to fetch users for the caller column, we required read permissions for the sys_users table. The above permissions can be achieved with the roles personalize_choices, personalize_dictionary, rest_service, itil. Read/Write permissions to the api_key_credentials table is required to enable two-way integration. This can be covered with the roles credentials_admin and discovery_admin. Set up a destination To create a ServiceNow destination, enter the following information: Destination Name: custom name to identify the destination Domain: the URL of the destination User-name: the name of the user Password: the user name’s password Before saving the destination, we recommend testing the connection by clicking the test connection button. Two-way sync You can configure a two-way integration with ServiceNow Incidents Management to keep the incidents' state synced with the corresponding state in New Relic. Here are some required steps to remember when configuring the two-way integration: Turn on the two-way integration toggle. Open and download this XML file, which includes the business rule triggering events back to New Relic One. In the ServiceNow sidebar menu, go to System Definition > Business Rules. Click the menu icon in one of the column headers, select Import XML and upload the XML file you downloaded. Once the Destination is saved, a New-Relic API-Key will be kept in the api_key_credentials. The key would sent in a header as part of the callback REST call to New-Relic Configure the message template Upon a successful connection, ServiceNow incident table columns are fetched from your account and automatically mapped to your ServiceNow instance. To help you get started, we automatically present the required and recommended fields and values. Required fields must be set with a value. You can add or remove optional fields(use the X mark on their right side) Select, edit or remove fields for the ServiceNow-Incident template. Send a test notification You can see how the ServiceNow incident will appear by clicking a test notification with default field values. If successful, an incident will be created and a link will appear. Slack Send notifications-messages to your Slack channels. Prerequisites Your Slack workspace needs to have the New Relic application installed. The application must be approved by a workspace admin before it can be individually installed by users Set up a Slack destination Click on the `one-click Slack authentication' will lead you to the Slack landing page to continue the OAuth2 authentication process. On the Slack landing page, if you're not signed into the required workspace, you're redirected to Slack to sign in. Add your workspace name or select the relevant workspace and click Continue. When signed in to the selected workspace, you are requested to allow New Relic to perform the specified actions. Clicking `Allow' will redirect you back to the Destination page. Configure the Slack message settings Select a Destination(Workspace) and select a Slack-channel where the messages will be sent. You can create a new destination if there is no pre-defined destination for the required workspace. Note that, for privacy reasons, users need to be authenticated to select private channels (one-time process) Send a test notification You can send a test notification with a pre-defined example payload to the channel. This creates a message in the selected Slack-channel. Webhook Use the webhook notifier to send the notification messages to any endpoint you like. Set up a webhook destination To create a webhook destination, you need the following: Destination Name: A unique destination name URL: the endpoint of the target application, authentication and custom headers if needed. Authorization mechanism (Optional):. Can be basic authentication or a bearer token Configure the webhook event template Pick a webhook destination from the list and configure the HTTP-POST request. The request configuration requires you to: Set a name for the template. Select a pre-configured destination from the destinations list or create a new one. Add custom headers (optional). Configure the request’s payload. Customize the webhook payload You can use the default payload or customize it to contain the required data. Pick Variables from the variables menu and apply handlebars syntax to enrich your webhook. Note that the request’s content-type is JSON by default. Hence, the payload needs to keep the JSON form. See Usage examples The ‘preview’ section on the right hand-side shows an expected payload after the template is rendered. If the eventual payload would not form a valid Json, an error will be shown and it won’t be possible to save the template. If the webhook payload conforms a valid Json, you can send a test notification to your defined webhook destination We recommend sending a test notification to make sure that everything's connected correctly.",

New release note To add a release note to the docs site: Find the most recent release note for your agent, and make a copy of it in the same folder. When you rename your copy, avoid potential version naming conflicts by using a - separator in your file name. For example, instead of agent-123, use agent-1-2-3 for version 1.2.3 and agent-12-3 for version 12.3. Fill in the subject, releaseDate, and version. If applicable, include the downloadLink field. Using our standard headings for New features, Improvements, and Bug fixes, add enough summary information in these sections to make a great release note. Link to docs or other resources where they can learn more. Commit your changes and submit a pull request. If your release is date-sensitive, make a note in your PR. A Tech Docs hero will review your release note content and approve your PR to get it published. You can also request others on your team to review your PR. We build and deploy the docs site a few times a day, and sometimes builds can take a few hours to complete. If your release is time-sensitive, ensure you've planned for enough time to get your docs live. What makes a great release note? Great release notes help users quickly become familiar with your important update, so they know why it matters. Great release notes also help our support and security teams. By encouraging users to keep current with your latest release, this reduces support time to solve problems on outdated versions. It also mitigates risks if any potential vulnerabilities have been resolved with your latest version. To write a great release note, be as specific as possible. For example: Briefly describe new functionality. Give an example of the value it provides, and link to more detailed information. Don't use vague wording such as \"various bug fixes.\" Instead, clearly state what has been improved, so readers will know if an issue they’ve experienced has been resolved. New release notes category This information is primarily for the Tech Docs team's use. To add a new release notes category, update the following areas of the docs site. (You do not need to update the releaseNote.js or releaseNoteLandingPage.js files in the nav/templates folder.) Before you submit your pull request to the GitHub docs site, check that the landing pages and placeholder release note build correctly in your localhost. Category landing page In /src/content/docs/release-notes, add the following: A folder for your new release notes category. The RSS feed link, page format, and date order for release notes listed on this page are generated automatically. For example, see the C SDK category landing page format. An index.mdx file in your new folder containing the subject. The subject is the name that will appear on the Release notes landing page. A placeholder release note in this folder for the agent team to fill out. If used, the downloadLink field in the release note will be formatted automatically in the published release note. Before the new category goes live, check with the team's Product Marketing Management (PMM) rep whether they want to include the link in an upcoming What's new post. Landing page In /src/content/docs/release-notes/index.mdx, add a new tile section in alphabetical order for your release notes category. Example: <TechTile name=\"Logs\" icon=\"logo-newrelic\" to=\"/docs/release-notes/logs-release-notes\" /> Copy Logos come from @newrelic/gatsby-theme-newrelic/icons/logo/. If a logo does not already exist for the new agent, use the standard logo-newrelic icon or an image in @newrelic/gatsby-theme-newrelic/icons/feathers.js. If you need other options, talk to the team's designer. Links from other categories Add a link to your new release notes category in the agent's documentation, typically in its Get started category. For more information, see our documentation about docs in multiple menus. Optional: Add a link in the agent's landing page text by updating the index.mdx file in its taxonomy.",

If the issue you are documenting is more of a known issue (FYI in nature), or if it doesn't solve the issue: Incorporate the information into other relevant docs. Do not refer to it as a known issue. OR Create a troubleshooting doc that describes the problem and cause. Do not include a solution. Also, include any statements promising that the issue will be fixed in a future release. Cause Generally, this is the why of the troubleshooting doc, and is optional. The Cause section is particularly useful when the product works in an unintuitive way. Provide background information or context that gives the user additional insight into the problem. If the problem and the cause text are both very short, you can include the cause in the Problem section. Related info In general, leave blank. The standard For more help footer block will appear automatically when published. If necessary, use this section to link to other, related docs if it does not make sense to refer to them within the context of other information in the troubleshooting doc itself.",

      "body": "Our NGINX integration collects and sends inventory and metrics from your NGINX server to our platform, where you can see data on connections and client requests so that you can find the source of any problems. To install the NGINX monitoring integration, you must run through the following steps: Enabling your NGINX Server. Configure the integration. Install and activate the integration. Find and use data. Optionally, see the advanced configuration settings. Important For best results, regularly update the integration package and the infrastructure agent. Compatibility and requirements Our integration is compatible with both NGINX Open Source and NGINX Plus. Before installing the integration, ensure you meet the following requirements: A New Relic account. Don't have one? Sign up for free! No credit card required. NGINX extension enabled, as described in the Configure the integration section. If NGINX is not running on Kubernetes or Amazon ECS, you must install the infrastructure agent on a Linux OS host that's running NGINX. Otherwise: If running on Kubernetes, see these requirements. If running on Amazon ECS, see these requirements. Enabling your NGINX Server To capture data from the NGINX integration, you must first enable and configure the applicable extension module: For NGINX Open Source, see HTTP stub status module. For NGINX Plus, see HTTP status module and HTTP API module. Configure the integration There are several ways to configure the integration, depending on how it was installed: If it was enabled via Kubernetes, see Monitor services running on Kubernetes. If it was enabled via Amazon ECS, see Monitor services running on ECS. If it was installed on-host, edit the integration's nginx-config.yml configuration file. An integration's YAML-format configuration is where you can place required login credentials and configure how data is collected. The options you change depend on your setup and preference. The configuration file has common settings applicable to all integrations such as interval, timeout, or inventory_source. To read about these common settings, see configuration format. Important If you are still using our Legacy configuration and definition files, refer to this document for help. Specific settings related to NGINX are defined using the env section of the configuration file. These settings control the connection to your NGINX instance as well as other security settings and features. The list of valid settings is described in the next section of this document. Install and activate the integration To install the NGINX integration, follow the instructions for your environment: Linux installation Install the infrastructure agent, and use nri-nginx as filename. Change the directory to the integrations configuration folder by running: bash Copy $ cd /etc/newrelic-infra/integrations.d Copy the sample configuration file by running: bash Copy $ sudo cp nginx-config.yml.sample nginx-config.yml Edit the nginx-config.yml configuration file with your favorite editor. Check out some great configuration file examples.. Restart the infrastructure agent. See how to restart the infrastructure agent in different Linux environments. Other environments Amazon ECS installation See Monitor service running on ECS. Kubernetes installation See Monitor service running on Kubernetes. Additional notes: Advanced: Integrations are also available in tarball format to allow for install outside of a package manager. On-host integrations do not automatically update. For best results, regularly update the integration package and the infrastructure agent. nginx-config.yml sample files Basic configuration This is the very basic configuration to collect Metrics and Inventory from your localhost: integrations: - name: nri-nginx env: METRICS: \"true\" STATUS_URL: http://127.0.0.1/status STATUS_MODULE: discover REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 30s labels: env: production role: load_balancer - name: nri-nginx env: INVENTORY: \"true\" STATUS_URL: http://127.0.0.1/status CONFIG_PATH: /etc/nginx/nginx.conf REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 60s labels: env: production role: load_balancer inventory_source: config/nginx Copy HTTP Basic authentication This configuration collects Metrics and Inventory from your localhost protected with basic authentication. Replace the username and password on the STATUS_URL with your credentials: integrations: - name: nri-nginx env: METRICS: \"true\" STATUS_URL: http://username:password@127.0.0.1/status STATUS_MODULE: discover REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 30s labels: env: production role: load_balancer - name: nri-nginx env: INVENTORY: \"true\" STATUS_URL: http://username:password@127.0.0.1/status CONFIG_PATH: /etc/nginx/nginx.conf REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 60s labels: env: production role: load_balancer inventory_source: config/nginx Copy Metrics with only one self-signed certificate In this configuration we only have 1 integration block with METRICS: true to collect only metrics and added VALIDATE_CERTS: false to prevent validation of the server's SSL certificate when using a self-signed one: integrations: - name: nri-nginx env: METRICS: \"true\" STATUS_URL: https://my_nginx_host/status STATUS_MODULE: discover VALIDATE_CERTS: false REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 30s labels: env: production role: load_balancer Copy Environment variables replacement In this configuration we are using the environment variable NGINX_STATUS to populate the STATUS_URL setting of the integration: integrations: - name: nri-nginx env: METRICS: \"true\" STATUS_URL: {{NGINX_STATUS}} STATUS_MODULE: discover VALIDATE_CERTS: false REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 30s labels: env: production role: load_balancer Copy Multi-instance monitoring In this configuration we are monitoring multiple NGINX servers from the same integration. For the first instance (STATUS_URL: https://1st_nginx_host/status) we are collecting metrics and inventory while for the second instance (STATUS_URL: https://2nd_nginx_host/status) we will only collect metrics. integrations: - name: nri-nginx env: METRICS: \"true\" STATUS_URL: https://1st_nginx_host/status STATUS_MODULE: discover VALIDATE_CERTS: false REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 30s labels: env: production role: load_balancer - name: nri-nginx env: INVENTORY: \"true\" STATUS_URL: https://1st_nginx_host/status CONFIG_PATH: /etc/nginx/nginx.conf REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 60s labels: env: production role: load_balancer inventory_source: config/nginx - name: nri-nginx env: METRICS: \"true\" STATUS_URL: http://2nd_nginx_host/status STATUS_MODULE: discover VALIDATE_CERTS: false REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 30s labels: env: production role: load_balancer Copy Find and use data After you've configured and installed the integration, you can start monitoring: Data from this service, which is reported to an integration dashboard. Metrics that are attached to the NginxSample event type. You can query this data for troubleshooting purposes or to create custom charts and dashboards.

      "body": "We use the data dictionary to provide information about data types (for example, Transaction, Metric, Log) and attached attributes. This is exposed in the New Relic query experience, on hovering over the data types and attributes. And we also expose the dictionary to the public. This doc contains info on how to add data to the dictionary. Note that currently we don't have infrastructure integration data in the dictionary. We also have very few attributes for the Metric data type, just a few basic default ones, despite there being many potential attributes attached to that data type depending on what the data source is. Data dictionary structure The data in the data dictionary is structured like this: Data types: sometimes called \"events\" for historical reasons, these are the NRDB data objects, like Transaction, Metric, Log, Span, etc. Attributes: these are key:value pairs attached to data types. One attribute can have multiple data types listed for it. For example, appName is on multiple data types. Data source: The New Relic product from which the data originates. With the current implementation, a data type must have a single data source assigned. This isn't ideal, as theoretically a data type can come from multiple sources. Add a new data type To add a new data type: Make a new folder in this directory, alongside the other directories: src/data-dictionary/events Copy Duplicate a data type file (for example, this Metric data type), place it in the new folder, and fill it out with the new info. For how to add attributes on a new data type, keep reading. Add attributes To add attributes: Check if there's an existing attribute that has the same name and same general definition as the one you're trying to add. If it exists, edit that file to include the new data type (under events:). If an existing attribute is fairly close in definition but not exact, try to edit the definition so it works for all associated data types. If there is no existing attribute, create a new one. The easiest way is to copy an existing attribute file, edit all relevant fields to be accurate, and place it in the folder of the data type it's attached to (for example, Transaction). When writing an attribute, try to keep it as concise as possible, and avoid using links. For more on that, see Style. If the attribute has one of the units of measurement we use (like units: percentage (%)), add that to the front matter. For info on units, see Units. Attribute style guidelines When adding or editing attributes, some things to keep in mind: Aim for concise descriptions. Notes on this: Feel free to use sentence fragments. Feel free to edit definitions submitted from internal teams as sometimes their definitions will be overly long or have unneeded links. Some attributes are only present in some situations (for example, when a specific APM agent is used, or when a specific config option is true). We should avoid documenting most of these, with the idea that most customers will only care about the data because it's being reported for them, and won't care about the things that factor into the reasons why it wouldn't be reported. If it's thought that the addition would help customers who already have the data reporting understand the data better, you can include it. Write so it reads well as plain text. Details on this: Note that the docs site data dictionary has our usual docs styles available, but the query UI definitions have no styling available. This means that you should write definitions so that they are understandable without any styling, as plain text. You can often avoid any need for styling (for example, data types like Transaction are easy to understand as plain text, as are most phrasings that use attribute names or values. When plain text makes something too ambiguous and you need some styling, use back ticks to indicate attributes or values (for example, a definition like: Reported when ` category ` is ` http ` ). Using this also sets us up for success if we implement styling in the UI definitions in the future. We should avoid links because those aren't visible in the query UI; the query UI only displays plain text. However, every attribute entry in the query UI does display a 'See attribute in docs' link that links to the complete and normally formatted docs site entry. This means that we can use links provided that they will display in an easy to understand way in the query UI. For example, here's an example of an attribute that would read clearly in plain text despite not having a link. We should avoid using a link format like \"For more information, see Create an alert condition\", because it wouldn't read well in plain text, and would choose something like \"For more information, see our alert condition docs.\" Using units of measurement Attribute entries have an optional unit of measurement field in the front matter. For example, here the front matter for an attribute with a percent unit of measurement: --- name: cpuPercent type: attribute units: percentage (%) events: - ProcessSample --- Copy What unit of measurement to select for an attribute is sometimes obvious, like if the attribute value is measured in milliseconds (units: milliseconds (ms)) or seconds (units: seconds (s)) or a percentage (units: percentage (%)). We also have several units of measurement that are not obvious, like count, enum, rate, and ID. (Technically, these aren't actually \"units of measurement\" and are more just conceptual data types but we're doing it this way as a workaround so you can ignore the fact that units of measurement isn't actually accurate.) The main reason we want to specify this information is that this will control what kinds of queries or charts can be created or auto-suggested by New Relic. For example, the New Relic UI wouldn't want to auto-suggest a chart graphing the average of ID values because that wouldn't make any sense. So attributes with accurate units, such as data types, will help product provide more practical help/suggestions to customers in future. Here are some tips for the non-obvious unit types: count: This is a count of something, though not a count of time-based units. For a number to be a count, it must (a) only be capable of increasing during a given time/sampling period, and (b) have a theoretically uncapped range. This wouldn't be used for a count of time units; if it was a count of seconds, for example, you would just use 'seconds' as the unit of measurement. A couple of examples of a count: databaseCallCount threadConcurrency enum: enum is short for enumerated list. In other words, it is a specific range of numbers that represent other non-numeric elements. For example, an attribute that had HTTP error codes (404, 505, etc.) as possible values would be an enum. A range of numbers that represent color codes would be another example of an enum. (Theoretically, an enum can represent lists without numeric values but we have no need to categorize strings so we only care about numeric-value lists.) Example: httpResponsecode. rate: Use this for any rate (for example, count per second). These are typically for averaged rates over small units of time, like second or millisecond. We previously have used the unit of time for these attributes (for example, using seconds as the unit of measurement for a count per second rate), but now we want to use rate for these. This is necessary because the types of displays used for rates would be different than the types of displays used for a simpler duration/count measurement. Example: MySQL integration attribute db.innodb.dataReadBytesPerSecond, which has the definition \"Rate at which data is read from InnoDB tables in bytes per second.\" id: Use ID for any identification number attribute. Example: appId.",

      "body": "Introduction: This section will introduce the agent and the API in general terms. Talk about when a user would want the API, and alternatives to using the API (for example, instrumentation via XML file). Mention that the API is often unnecessary if your framework has “out of the box” support. Link to the root of your API reference, whether that is on-site or off-site. Warn the user that they need to be on the most recent agent version. Instrument missing sections of your code with transactions To instrument your app, New Relic separates each path through your code into its own transaction. New Relic times (or “instruments”) the parent method in these transactions to measure your app’s overall performance, and collects transaction traces from long-running transactions for additional detail. For more information about transactions, see transaction and transaction trace. Use these methods when New Relic is not instrumenting a particular part of your code at all: If you want to...

See [ link to reference or tutorial doc for ignoreTransaction() equivalent] Time specific methods using segments If a transaction is already visible in the New Relic UI, but you don’t have enough data about a particular method that was called during that transaction, you can create segments to time those individual methods in greater detail.

Enhance the metadata of a transaction Sometimes, the code you are targeting is visible in the New Relic UI, but some details of the method are not useful. For example, the default name might not be helpful (perhaps it is causing a metric grouping issue), or you want to add custom attributes to your transactions so you can filter them in Insights.

The page that opens is index.js, the file that manages the parts of the home page, but not the content. It's rare that you'll need to make changes to this file. Most home page changes will be to add a new tile or section to the page, or update links. These types of changes are handled in two files: src/data/homepage.yml - contains home page section titles, section descriptions, and the URLs for tiles. src/i18n/translations/en/translation.json - contains tile info, including the title and short description of tiles. Update a link's URL Change or add new links using homepage.yml. In homepage.yml, search for the link you want to change. Edit the URL, save, commit, and PR the change. Add a new tile to the home page You'll make changes to both homepage.yml and translations.json On the translations.json doc, find the spot where you want to add the new tile (which section, and in what order you want it to appear), and add a new entry with this format: \"t#\": { \"title\": \"tile name\", \"description\": \"Short description.\" }, Copy Make sure you update the number on the tile. If you want to insert it in the middle of a group, update all the subsequent tile numbers as well. Save the file. Open homepage.yml, find the spot where the new tile will be, and add a new line with the relative link for the new tile. For example, - /docs/new-relic-one/use-new-relic-one/workloads/workloads-isolate-resolve-incidents-faster Save and check that your new tile builds properly on a local build. Commit, push, PR when you're ready. Add a new section to the home page On the translations.json page, add a new section modeled in the spot where you want the new section to appear. Include at least one title. For example, here's the TDP entry, with one tile: \"errors-inbox\": { \"title\": \"Errors Inbox\", \"description\": \"A single place to proactively detect, triage, and take action on all the errors before they impact customers.\", \"t1\": { \"title\": \"Introduction to Errors Inbox\", \"description\": \"How to manage all your monitoring in one place.\" }, Copy When you're done creating the info, save the file. In the homepage.yml page, find the corresponding location for the new section, and add the short name you provided in the translation.json file, title, description, and tile URLs. For example, here's the corresponding TDP section on homepage.yml. errors-inbox: title: Errors Inbox description: A single place to proactively detect, triage, and take action on all the errors before they impact customers. tiles: - /docs/errors-inbox/errors-inbox Copy Save, build locally, commit, PR. Edit the home page left nav The left nav of the home page is controlled by src/nav/root.yml. This is a basic yml file, similar to our taxonomy files. Each link on the left nav needs a title and a path: - title: Welcome to New Relic path: /docs/using-new-relic - title: New Relic One path: /docs/new-relic-one/use-new-relic-one - title: Guides and best practices path: /docs/new-relic-solutions - title: section-break - title: Alerts and Applied Intelligence path: /docs/alerts-applied-intelligence Copy You can add a new link by following the pattern above or delete a link by removing the corresponding title and path. Section breaks are added by including a - title: section-break line. The left nav reflects the exact order of root.yml, so it's easy to organize it as needed.",

      "body": "Sliding windows are a technique for generating charts using the SLIDE BY clause in conjunction with the TIMESERIES clause. With sliding windows, data is gathered in time \"windows\" that overlap with each other. For example, in the image below, a query gathers data with 5 minute windows. The windows \"slide\" by 1 minute. Each window overlaps with the previous window by 4 minutes. 5-minute windows with 1-minute \"slide\" In contrast, with \"tumbling\" or \"cascading\" windows, the windows do not overlap. For example, in this TIMESERIES 3 minutes NRQL query, the windows are 3 minutes in length, with each beginning when the other ends. There is no overlap in the measurement interval. 3-minute windows with no overlap or \"slide\". When to use sliding windows Sliding windows are helpful when you need to smooth out \"spiky\" charts. One common use case is to use sliding windows to smooth line graphs that have a lot of variation over short periods of time in cases where the rolling aggregate (for example a rolling mean) is more important than aggregates from narrow windows of time. In the example below, data varies greatly from one minute to another, so the 1-minute tumbling window chart shows many high peaks and low valleys. TIMESERIES query without SLIDE BY clause However, in this example, 5-minute wide TIMESERIES windows are smoothed with the help of 1-minute SLIDE BY intervals. The query returns similar data but creates a much smoother chart. TIMESERIES query with SLIDE BY clause Valid NRQL syntax for SLIDE BY Valid NRQL syntax for the SLIDE BY clause will follow the format below. SELECT ... TIMESERIES integer1 units SLIDE BY integer2 units Copy integer1 specifies the sliding window width and integer2 specifies the SLIDE BY interval. units is a time unit, such as second, minute, hour, or day. All standard NRQL time units are accepted. Here’s a real-life example. It shows 5-minute TIMESERIES windows with a 1-minute SLIDE BY interval. SELECT average(duration) from Transaction TIMESERIES 5 minutes SLIDE BY 1 minute Copy Translation from PromQL-style queries When applicable, a PromQL-style query is translated into a NRQL sliding window query. For example, if your PromQL style query uses rate(request_count[5m]) for the past 60 minutes with a 1-minute window overlap, the NRQL translation would be the query below. SELECT rate(sum(request_count), 1 SECONDS) FROM Metric SINCE 3600 SECONDS AGO UNTIL NOW FACET dimensions() LIMIT 100 TIMESERIES 300000 SLIDE BY 60000 Copy In the translation output, the default unit of millisecond is used for TIMESERIES and SLIDE BY clauses. For TIMESERIES, 300000 ms is 300 seconds, or 5 minutes, specifying a window size of 5 minutes. For SLIDE BY, 60000 ms is 60 seconds, specifying a slide interval of 1 minute. Use SLIDE BY with MAX and AUTO You can combine SLIDE BY with MAX and AUTO arguments to further tailor query results, as shown in the examples below. SELECT average(duration) FROM Transaction TIMESERIES 5 minutes SLIDE BY MAX Copy SELECT average(duration) FROM Transaction TIMESERIES 5 minutes SLIDE BY AUTO Copy Tip When paired with SLIDE BY, TIMESERIES does not support AUTO or MAX. The TIMESERIES value must be an integer time unit value. In other words, SLIDE BY AUTO or SLIDE BY MAX will work, but TIMESERIES AUTO or TIMESERIES MAX followed by SLIDE BY and MAX, AUTO, or a specific integer time unit is not supported. Tip The SLIDE BY value as determined by AUTO or MAX can produce a step interval greater than the window size, which will show up as gaps and unexpected results. If you experience these issues with query results, consider checking for instances of SLIDE BY where the step interval exceeds the window size.",

By following these guidelines, you'll make it easier for readers to skim and find what they need. How to organize information Comments Separate what and why from how. Define any necessary prerequisites, policies, or background information (the what and the why) before you step through the how (step-by-step procedures). Examples: Explain what the feature is and why it matters before telling readers how to use it. Describe any limitations with user permissions or subscription levels that would prevent them from using the feature. If the feature is available for any user or subscription level, don't bother to say so. Provide a roadmap for what users will be able to accomplish, so they know before starting a procedure that they have everything they need. Front-load directions with context. Make sure readers know where they need to be, before telling them what to do. In general, use (select an app) to describe what users select from the product index. Examples: Go to one.newrelic.com > Explorer > (select an app or service). Select (account dropdown) > User preferences. On the command line, type gitk. Also, structure steps by front-loading context from the user's point of view. For example, instead of \"Go to x to do y,\" structure the step as \"To do y, go to x.\" Separate requirements from options. Example: Type the Email you use to sign in and to receive information from New Relic. Optional: Type additional user emails, separated by commas. Follow the \"five to nine\" guideline. Depending on the topic, organize the information so there is a maximum of five to nine chunks of information. For example, readers may start to get lost or overwhelmed after about five h2 sections or seven steps into a procedure. If you have more than nine h2 sections or steps, you might need to create an additional doc or procedure. Other organization tools to consider: Levels of headings Lists Collapsers Callouts Tables Code examples For more help section Use action-oriented titles Wherever possible, give your document or h2 heading a task- or action-oriented title.

Quality Title example Bad The query history Okay View query history Good Query history: Create and edit NRQL queries Start the document with an introductory paragraph Unless the document is less than a single screen in length, begin with a brief paragraph that introduces the topic or summarizes the important points. Not sure where to start? Try writing all the content for your document first, and then add the introduction to the top to summarize your key points. Or use the introduction to expand on the text in your metaDescription in the metadata. Keep documents short The amount of content needed can help you decide whether you need one or more documents for the topic. If all of the document's contents apply directly to the title, then everything belongs in the same document. If several related sections could be logically split into individual documents, and the overall length of your document is more than about two screenfuls, split those sections into other documents. Be sure to include links to the related contents. If a large document needs to be broken into multiple smaller documents, consider whether they might be best grouped together in their own sub-category.

      "body": "As tech doc writers (TW) we edit docs, do peer edits, or use the Docs Team GitHub board to track the status of issues and pull requests (PR). Who is who in an issue/PR? GitHub keeps track of all activity concerning an issue or PR, including, of course, the people involved. When a new issue or PR is filed, check on the filer’s username and see if they're listed as a member of the New Relic organization. If they aren't, try to find them on Slack based on their username. If you're not sure about someone's affiliation, treat them as external until you know otherwise. People in an issue/PR include: Creator: The person who opened the issue or PR. This could be a writer, a Relic, or an external user. We'll label the issue or PR differently depending on who created it. If you're not sure if a user is a Relic, a good trick is to click on their profile and see if they're a member of the New Relic GitHub org. Assignee: The person taking responsibility for a PR or issue. This will usually be used by the Hero or Sidekick to assign non-TW PRs and issues to themselves. It can also be used to take a TW’s PR or issue over from them. Reviewer: The person who reviews or peer edits the code/document and approves the changes. Not necessarily the person responsible for that area or responsible for merging the commit. You can pre-assign up to 100 reviewers to a given issue. Track issues in the board The docs board has the following columns: Column Description Needs triage The Hero or Sidekick review and label issues and PRs in this column, then drag them to the appropriate column. If a PR or issue is labeled eng, the Hero/Sidekick can go ahead and click its ellipses icon to archive it. Hero: to do PRs that the Hero needs to review, publish, and follow up with SMEs as needed. Hero: Assign yourself as Assignee. In review (Hero or any TW) Drag PRs to this column when they are being reviewed. This shows who is reviewing and what is being reviewed, so two writers don’t mistakenly work on the same PR. Any TW: Writer needs PR review PRs from Tech Docs team members that need a light edit pass to make sure everything in GitHub is correct. This should be checked by other writers every few hours so PRs don’t get stale. If you have a PR that’s been lingering here too long, ask for a reviewer in #doc_sprint_talk. Whoever takes it: assign yourself as Reviewer. Any TW: needs peer edit Like our Needs Peer Edit column in Jira: A writer has requested a review of their PR. Review their PR in GitHub and leave comments. Whoever takes it: assign yourself as Reviewer. Waiting on SME/Blocked For PRs that are blocked by need for SME info or confirmation (for example, as Hero you are waiting on an answer from the person who sent in a Hero pull request). Waiting on TW to merge All reviews are complete. The TW who created the PR (or who is assigned the issue) needs to merge this work into develop. Drafts A draft is a way to open a PR while indicating that the work is still in progress and not necessarily ready to merge immediately. You can't merge a Draft PR directly. Instead, you must move it out of draft status first. When you see a draft PR (especially from outside the team!), treat it as though it's a working draft, and reach out to the creator to discuss. Read more on GitHub's drafts. As a Hero, make sure you attend to the following throughout your day: Check in with the previous Hero at the start of your day (especially on Monday at the start of the week). Don’t forget to sync with the BCN Hero if necessary. Watch for incoming PRs in #docs_deploys, and review everything in the Needs triage column. Drag cards from that column to the appropriate column. Work through the cards in the Hero: to do column. Everyone on the team helps keep things moving: All writers should keep an eye on both Any TW columns. There's one column for PRs that need a simpler review before merging (typo fixes, drive-by edits, etc), and another column for PRs that need a peer edit. There are also two blocked columns: One for PRs blocked on a SME, and another column where we're waiting on the TW who created the PR to review feedback and/or merge. After merging, remove your ticket from the board. Deal with references in GitHub (and the style guide) Don't link to anything non-public from a public place. You can reference Jira tickets, but reference tickets by issue key (DOC-1234 is ok) rather than a link (https://newrelic.atlassian.net/browse/DOC-1234 is not). Don't mention traffic or usage numbers publicly. Don't reference internal people by name. If they have a GH account, @mention their GH handle. If they don't, talk instead about teams (\"talk to a browser team engineer\" or \"Support Engineer\") rather than people. You can mention the #documentation channel and hero. Merge releases into main work (or, when do we publish?) The Hero currently merges three times a day: At 9 AM (morning), 12 PM (noon), and 3 PM (evening) Pacific. We merge release branches into main to avoid interuptions when someone merges into develop during a release. To learn more about this workflow, see the gitflow documentation in Atlassian. To start a release: Create a branch based off develop Github Desktop by clicking Current Branch in the top header, clicking New Branch in the dropdown, and then selecting Develop. Name the branch following this pattern: daily-release/mm-dd-yy-morning/noon/evening. Here's an example: daily-release/10-27-21-morning. Push your changes by clicking Push Origin in GitHub Desktop. Create a pull request into main from your new daily release branch by clicking Create Pull Request. This will open a pull request screen on github.com. Pull requests default to merging into develop, so select main as the base branch in the left side of the page and then click Submit Pull Request. Wait until all the checks complete, and then merge the pull request. All branches that follow the daily-release/mm-dd-yy-morning pattern are protected branches. This means the branches can't be deleted or pushed to by non-admins. GitHub labels Every issue needs labels to help us triage and track the health of our backlog: content: Always add, this indicates the issue is content-related rather than a design or engineering issue. pg_*: Always add to indicate the product group. For full definitions, see the \"Doc Jira and GitHub fields\" doc in the internal team Google Drive. Indicate who created the issue: from_internal: A Relic created it. from_external: A user opened it in the repo OR it came in through #customer-feedback process. from_tw: One of us created it (unless we were passing along #customer-feedback). Optionally: docs-issues-migrate: Issues that are too large in scope for the docs team to handle without product team expertise. This label alerts the docs issues team to migrate these issues into the customer feedback channel where they will be triaged and sent to product teams. Jira’d: Issues that have a corresponding Jira ticket. Make sure you leave the Jira number in the comments of the issue (for example, DOC-1234). Every pull request needs these labels so we can see where our contributions come from: content: Always add, this indicates the PR is content-related rather than design or engineering. Indicate who created the pull request: from_internal: A Relic created it. from_external: A user opened it in the repo OR it came in through #customer-feedback process. from_tw: One of us created it (unless we were passing along #customer-feedback). If the PR fixes an external issue, label it as from_tw since the work was done by a tech writer. Check the edit history of a doc or file Use any of these options to check or \"diff\" the history of a file. Option 1: GitHub history tab Navigate to the doc on the doc site and click Edit page in the right nav. Click History in the top right corner of the doc. Option 2: githistory.xy Navigate to your specific file on GitHub.com: https://github.com/newrelic/docs-website/blob/develop/src/content/docs/browser/new-relic-browser/browser-agent-spa-api/add-page-action.mdx Copy In the url, replace github.com with github.githistory.xyz: https://github.githistory.xyz/newrelic/docs-website/blob/develop/src/content/docs/browser/new-relic-browser/browser-agent-spa-api/add-page-action.mdx Copy It will take you to a site which presents the visual history of that specific file. You can view changes by clicking through the commit history at the top of your page. Option 3: Git blame Follow GitHub's documentation. Alternatively, you can use the following command in your terminal: git log --follow \"**/file_name_here.mdx\" Copy This will output the commit history of that file. By default, it only shows the first few commits. You can scroll by pressing Return multiple times. For example, to find the commit history for vmware-vsphere-monitoring-integration.mdx, I would run: git log --follow \"**/vmware-vsphere-monitoring-integration.mdx\" Copy Docs site history before October 2021 We had a large site restructure in October 2021 which lost most of the file history for our docs. You can find an archived version of our site pre-rework in the pre-IA-2021 branch. By navigating the pre-rework version of our repo, you can find file history and more.",

      "body": "These are some organization basics. Organize your page to make it easier to read Consider these organization guidelines when thinking about the order of information in a doc. By following these guidelines, you'll make it easier for readers to skim and find what they need. How to organize information Comments Separate what and why from how. Define any necessary prerequisites, policies, or background information (the what and the why) before you step through the how (step-by-step procedures). Examples: Explain what the feature is and why it matters before telling readers how to use it. Describe any limitations with user permissions or subscription levels that would prevent them from using the feature. If the feature is available for any user or subscription level, don't bother to say so. Provide a roadmap for what users will be able to accomplish, so they know before starting a procedure that they have everything they need. Front-load directions with context. Make sure readers know where they need to be, before telling them what to do. In general, use (select an app) to describe what users select from the product index. Examples: Go to one.newrelic.com > Explorer > (select an app or service). Select (account dropdown) > User preferences. On the command line, type gitk. Also, structure steps by front-loading context from the user's point of view. For example, instead of \"Go to x to do y,\" structure the step as \"To do y, go to x.\" Separate requirements from options. Example: Type the Email you use to sign in and to receive information from New Relic. Optional: Type additional user emails, separated by commas. Follow the \"five to nine\" guideline. Depending on the topic, organize the information so there is a maximum of five to nine chunks of information. For example, readers may start to get lost or overwhelmed after about five h2 sections or seven steps into a procedure. If you have more than nine h2 sections or steps, you might need to create an additional doc or procedure. Other organization tools to consider: Levels of headings Lists Collapsers Callouts Tables Code examples For more help section Use action-oriented titles Wherever possible, give your document or h2 heading a task- or action-oriented title. Focus on what users are trying to accomplish or the problem they're trying to solve. Use present-tense verbs, rather than \"-ing\" verbs. Quality Title example Bad The query history Okay View query history Good Query history: Create and edit NRQL queries Start the document with an introductory paragraph Unless the document is less than a single screen in length, begin with a brief paragraph that introduces the topic or summarizes the important points. Not sure where to start? Try writing all the content for your document first, and then add the introduction to the top to summarize your key points. Or use the introduction to expand on the text in your metaDescription in the metadata. Keep documents short The amount of content needed can help you decide whether you need one or more documents for the topic. If all of the document's contents apply directly to the title, then everything belongs in the same document. If several related sections could be logically split into individual documents, and the overall length of your document is more than about two screenfuls, split those sections into other documents. Be sure to include links to the related contents. If a large document needs to be broken into multiple smaller documents, consider whether they might be best grouped together in their own sub-category. Use the New Relic voice We strive for a voice that's approachable, expert, and visionary. Check out our voice guidelines for how to write content with these qualities. And keep in mind these essential writing tips that apply to any type of documentation. Guidelines Comments Be clear and direct. Remember to: Use present tense. Use active voice; avoid passive voice. Tell users what to do, not what they \"should\" do. If absolutely necessary, tell users what not to do in situations where unexpected results may occur. Whenever possible, provide an alternative suggestion when telling users what not to do. Example: Using active voice with an alternative suggestion for what not to do Do not use your config file to change this setting, because this could affect other processes. Instead, go to one.newrelic.com > APM > (select an app or service) > Settings > Application. Write to aid localization and translation. Do not use euphemisms, idioms, jargon, or slang. Use the same terms and wording consistently. If you need to include an abbreviation or acronym, spell it out the first time it appears in the document. Always take a moment to ask yourself whether people will really understand the terms you are using in the way you're using them. Change doc titles and anchors Because changes to doc titles, anchors, and redirects can break links to other docs, please create an issue to request these types of changes and we'll help you out with that. Create and edit categories Because changes to categories can affect large groups of docs at once, please create an issue to request these types of changes and we'll help you out with that.

      "body": "There may be cases where an application sends many individual metrics that could be better managed in groups. Most of these occur with web transactions metrics named from URLs. For more information on this issue, see Metric grouping issues (MGIs). To reduce high cardinality and prevent metric grouping issues, New Relic supports rules for grouping or filtering out metrics (normalization). In some cases, when MGIs with a significant high number of metrics are detected, a rule is created automatically to protect the platform from performance degradation. Metric normalization rules management You can create and manage new rules that deal with the noise produced from high cardinality metrics by using the metric normalization tool, which is accessible from each service dashboard in the New Relic Explorer. Once there, select Metric Normalization in the left sidebar. There you can see the existing rules or create new ones. Click a rule to modify it, or click Create a new rule to create a new one. A new pane to configure the rule will be displayed. Available fields are: Match expression: enter the regular expression to group all the metrics you want to include in the rule. Matches: here you will see a preview of the metrics matched by the regular expression above. Action: the action you want to perform on the metrics. Replace: replace the matched metrics by the regular expression with the value described in the Replacement field. Ignore: ignore any metric that matches the regular expression. Deny new metrics: only write metrics that have already been reported, and ignore those that match the regular expression. Replacement: only active when Replace is enabled. Matched metrics are replaced with the field's value. If the regular expression is capturing groups, you can use placeholders for them with \\1 or \\2 for the groups 1 and 2 respectively. Active: rules can’t be deleted, but can be deactivated. Click the toggle to enable or disable the rule. If you want the rule to be removed, reach out to New Relic's support. Terminate: When enabled, the rules waterfall is exited when the associated pattern is matched. Notes: internal notes on the rule. Has no effect on the rule.

Either way, you need a New Relic account if you don't already have one. (It's free, forever!) Get an account Start agent install EU guided install Our Node.js agent is publicly available on the Node Package Manager (npm) repository as well as on GitHub. Install the Node.js agent Important If you're using the agent in a Docker container, install the agent in each container. To install the Node.js agent: Create a New Relic account. Don't have one? Sign up for free! No credit card required. Ensure you meet the system requirements. In particular, make sure you use a supported Node version. Use the command npm install newrelic --save for each application you want to monitor. From node_modules/newrelic, copy newrelic.js into the root directory of your app. Configure agent via the newrelic.js file or via environment variable: Customize the license_key setting with your license key. Customize the app_name setting with one or more meaningful app names. Add require('newrelic'); as the first line of your app's main module. Important If you are using Babel or a similar transpiler you can safeguard against any issues related to module load order by utilizing the Node command line option '-r' to preload the 'newrelic' module at application startup. For example, if your application's entry point is ./dist/server.js then you would use the require flag like so: node -r newrelic ./dist/server.js Copy Optional: For additional Node.js runtime-level statistics, ensure the @newrelic/native-metrics package is installed. Generate some traffic, then wait a few minutes for data to appear in the APM UI. You can further customize your agent behavior via newrelic.js or an environment variable. To keep the agent configuration separate from your app, edit the NEW_RELIC_HOME environmental variable. View logs for your APM and infrastructure data You can also bring your logs and application's data together to make troubleshooting easier and faster. With logs in context, you can see log messages related to your errors and traces directly in your app's UI. You can also see logs in context of your infrastructure data, such as Kubernetes clusters. No need to switch to another UI page in New Relic One. Keep your Node.js agent up-to-date To ensure that you have the most up-to-date version of New Relic, refer to the Node.js release notes.

      "body": "A well-chosen screenshot or image can greatly improve the readability and clarity of a doc. Too many images or an image that's tough to parse can really slow things down. If you're not part of the Tech Docs team and you want to add an image to the docs site, create a GitHub issue. If you're a New Relic employee, contact @hero in the documentation Slack channel. Add an image We want to ensure that sensitive data does not appear in UI screenshots. That's why we recommend that you provide a permalink to a test account. Do not take a screenshot from your New Relic account. Here are some things to keep in mind when you're creating an image: Make sure your image provides useful information at a glance. Include a caption with helpful context for the image. For screenshot captions, include the path in bold. For video captions, include the approximate running time. Our doc site images are stored in individual images directories at the root level of each taxonomy category. These images directories contain all the images used in the docs for that category. To add an image from scratch: Find the images folder for your doc. For example, if your doc lives in the docs/style-guide/processes-procedures directory, use the docs/style-guide/processes-procedures/images folder. If the images directory does not exist in the directory where your doc lives, use VScode or Finder to create a folder in that directory named images (must be lower case and plural). Place your image in the images directory. Give the image a descriptive file name; for example, fso-ui-overview.png is much better than 123-go-dawgs.png. Continue with the following procedure to embed the image in a doc. Embed an image Use markdown to embed an image in a doc. The basic structure: ![alt text](PATH_TO_IMAGE \"Image title text\") Copy Here's a filled in example: ![An image showing an overview of the synthetic monitoring UI](./images/synthetics-ui-overview.png \"Synthetics UI overview\") Copy Update an image To update an image: Delete the original image file in the corresponding images directory. Place the new image file in the same images directory. Ensure the image file has the same name as the original file. Write image captions Descriptive captions help the reader know why the image matters. If it's a screenshot, it's helpful to include the path in bold in addition to a description. For example: ![Dashboards in New Relic One](./images/NR1-dashboards-image.png \"Dashboards in New Relic One\") <figcaption> **[one.newrelic.com](https://one.newrelic.com) > Dashboards**: Quickly create information-dense custom views into the data that matters most to you with dashboards in New Relic One. </figcaption> Copy For more help with captions and other supporting text around images, see Guidelines for explaining images. Add an inline image To use an inline image, add something like this: The UI includes a multiple app names indicator. ![Multiple app names indicator in New Relic One](./images/new-relic-distributed-tracing-multiapp-icon.png \"Multiple apps name indicator in New Relic One\") Copy If the inline image is being used as an icon, always describe it first. When you embed the icon image, follow the image with the word icon in the text. For example: Select your app's settings ![settings icon](./images/icon-settings.png \"settings icon\") icon. Copy Add a fixed width, block level image Fixed width, block level images are similar in format to full column width images, except the original image width is smaller than the column width (800px) of a page. It's important that you edit the HTML like you would an inline image. This way the image will be rendered at 100% of the column width and also be responsive to smaller screen sizes. Use these images when a screenshot is a small part of the page with a width of less than 800px, but when it still needs a caption like a full width image. Here's an example of the HTML for a fixed width, block level image: <div style=\"width: 100%; max-width: Npx;\"> <img alt=\"ALT TEXT\" height=\"X\" src=\"IMG_URL\" title=\"FILENAME\" width=\"N\"> </div> <div class=\"dnd-legend-wrapper\" style=\"width: 100%; max-width: Npx;\"> <div class=\"meta\"><p>CAPTION TEXT</p></div> </div> Copy Icons You can choose from a variety of icons to include in your docs: Feather icons (prefixed with 'fe-), which replace our previous Font Awesome icons New Relic icons (prefixed with nr-) Logos for third-party products (prefixed with logo-) To see if we already have an icon you need, go to: Feather.js for docs-website in GitHub: These are the Feather icons available in the docs-website project but are not included in the Gatsby theme. Gatsby theme for docs-website in GitHub: This is a subset of Feather, New Relic, and product logo icons that are available across the developer and docs sites. You can use any icons you need in the Gatsby theme or Feather. Currently these locations have separate, non-overlapping buckets of icons. Insert icons as tag attributes If your icon appears as an attribute inside another tag, prefix it with icon as in this example: <LandingPageTileGrid> <LandingPageTile title=\"AWS Lambda\" href=\"/docs/serverless-function-monitoring/aws-lambda-monitoring/get-started/monitoring-aws-lambda-serverless-monitoring\" icon=\"logo-aws\" > </LandingPageTile> Copy Insert inline icons If your icon appears inside running text, use the <Icon> component. Here are some examples: Feather: <Icon name=\"fe-database\" /> New Relic: <Icon name=\"nr-tdp\" /> Logos: <Icon name=\"logo-apple\" /> Install new Feather icons If you don't see the icon you want in either the Gatsby theme for docs-website in GitHub or in the Feather.js for docs-website in GitHub, you can add a new icon to the Gatsby theme. You can also ask developers to add the icon you want. Here's an example of adding a database icon: Go to feathericons.com. Download the database feather icon by clicking on the icon itself. Once downloaded, open the SVG file in your text editor. Copy the \"guts\" of the SVG, which is everything in between the <svg> tags. For example, if the SVG is <svg><path m=\"1\"></path></svg>, then copy only the <path m=\"1\"></path> portion. Open the list of feather icons at src/@newrelic/gatsby-theme-newrelic/icons/feather.js. Add an entry for database, and assign the code from the previous step to it. If the icon has multiple paths, include the <> wrapper around it like you see with other icons. Save the feather.js file. The fe- prefix gets added automatically. Once that icon is added, you can use it with the icon component; for example, <Icon name=\"fe-database\" />.",

      "body": "When you're creating a new doc, there's a lot to keep track of. You can use this checklist to make sure you've done everything. Title Check that: The doc's title effectively describes the contents. Procedural doc titles use active verbs; for example, Install not Installing. Introduction Check that: The introduction leads with an outcome and provides an overview of how to get there, so customers are confident they've found the right doc. It provides a short, readable overview of the doc's contents. Headings (H2s) Check that: Heading names are concise, yet provide information that helps readers to skim or skip to the section they want. Procedural H2s use active verbs, not the ing verb form. Text Check that the text: Optimizes for easier translation: Avoid idioms, slang, specific cultural references, etc. Tells a good story: Promotes the platform (other New Relic products, alerting, etc.). Includes examples and use cases, identifies personas, explains not only what it is or how to use it but why it matters. Includes hyperlinks in UI paths. Has no typos. Procedures Procedures use active voice and focus on steps (\"do this\"). Avoid burying tips or extra details in the steps. If the procedure includes prerequisites or background information, that information appears before (not buried inside) the ordered list of procedures. If a procedure or step branches, it splits the options so they are clearly visible as bullets, collapsers, etc. If the procedure says what not to do, it also describes what to do instead. Example: What not to do and what to do instead Do not monitor your own applications from the partnership owner account. Instead, create an account within the partnership, and monitor apps from that account. Structure The original tech writer or docs site contributor is the best judge of whether the draft doc is complete. However, in your peer edit, make notes if you have unanswered questions that aren't addressed within the doc or its cross references. Doc structure Comments Complete Check that the overall doc: Is complete, but stays on topic. Includes useful cross references, hyperlinks, and other suggestions to enhance the information, especially for SEO. Skimmable Readers can see at a glance what the doc is about and what to do. It's obvious what parts they can read and what parts they can skip. Visually clean The doc avoids excessive use of callouts, long sentences, or long paragraphs. Useful images For screenshots and images, check that: Full size images always have captions to explain their relevance. UI paths in captions always have hyperlinks. Cropped images clearly show their relevance, with or without captions. In addition, make sure that screenshots and images follow the docs site's security guidelines, and that no private information related to customers or New Relic is displayed. Levels of detail The doc uses H2s, H3s, bullets, tables, and clamshells to organize complex levels of information.",

For example, you'll see landing pages for Application monitoring (APM) and Browser monitoring. Important This landing page information does not apply to the docs home page. If you need to create a new landing page, you can either copy an existing landing page, or you can modify the sample landing page shown at the bottom. The next sections look at what you need to include for each landing page. Front matter When you insert the front matter, be sure to designate the type as landingPage. Here's an example: --- title: APM type: landingPage --- Copy Tip In the front matter, the following are optional: tags, translate, and redirects. So, you can leave them out if they don't have any values. Introduction section Following the front matter, the first content section is a two-column introduction (also called the hero section). This includes the following: A <LandingPageHero> component wrapping all the introductory content. A <HeroContent> component wrapping the text portion of the introduction (the content in the left column). An image or video (appears in the right column). A caption (optional), which is wrapped by the <figcaption> component. Here's an example of the hero section that shows you where to insert your content: <LandingPageHero> <HeroContent> INSERT_PARAGRAPHS_FOR_YOUR_INTRODUCTION </HeroContent> ![INSERT_ALT-TEXT_HERE](./images/INSERT_IMAGE_FILE_NAME.png \"INSERT_THE_IMAGE_TITLE_HERE\") <figcaption> INSERT_OPTIONAL_CAPTION_USING_SAME_INDENTATION_AS_IMAGE </figcaption> </LandingPageHero> Copy Tiles Tiles are a series of boxes after the introduction. They contain the main subject areas for your product. You should just list these in order you want them to appear, and the cascading style sheet will render them across the page. Here's an example of a tile: <LandingPageTileGrid> <LandingPageTile title=\"INSERT_YOUR_BOX_TITLE_HERE.\" href=\"/docs/INSERT_THE_DIRECTORY_PATH_TO_THE_TARGET_LANDING_PAGE_INDEX.HTML\" icon=\"fe-INSERT_THE_ICON_NAME\" > INSERT_TILE_CONTENT_HERE... </LandingPageTile> ... Copy For each tile, do the following: Insert a value for title that explains the purpose of the category. Insert a value for href that links to the target landing page. If the target landing page is index.html, you can just include the directory path with no filename since index.html is the default (it doesn't cause any problems if you include index.html). Insert a value for icon by prefixing the icon name with fe- (Feather icons), logo- (third-party logos), or nr- (New Relic logos). For example, here is the format for a feather icon: fe-alert-triangle). Tip For more details about icons, see Embed images. Between the LandingPageTile tags, insert text, such as a bullet list with links to product documentation. Button for viewing all docs in the category After your tiles, you should have a single button that offers to take users to all the documentation for that category. The table of contents page that gets linked here is always at the same path as the landing page, but with /table-of-contents appended to it. These table of contents pages get built automatically for every landing page. For example, if this landing page was located at /docs/apm, this link should be /docs/apm/table-of-contents.

New release note To add a release note to the docs site: Find the most recent release note for your agent, and make a copy of it in the same folder. When you rename your copy, avoid potential version naming conflicts by using a - separator in your file name. For example, instead of agent-123, use agent-1-2-3 for version 1.2.3 and agent-12-3 for version 12.3. Fill in the subject, releaseDate, and version. If applicable, include the downloadLink field. Using our standard headings for New features, Improvements, and Bug fixes, add enough summary information in these sections to make a great release note. Link to docs or other resources where they can learn more. Commit your changes and submit a pull request. If your release is date-sensitive, make a note in your PR. A Tech Docs hero will review your release note content and approve your PR to get it published. You can also request others on your team to review your PR. We build and deploy the docs site a few times a day, and sometimes builds can take a few hours to complete. If your release is time-sensitive, ensure you've planned for enough time to get your docs live. What makes a great release note? Great release notes help users quickly become familiar with your important update, so they know why it matters. Great release notes also help our support and security teams. By encouraging users to keep current with your latest release, this reduces support time to solve problems on outdated versions. It also mitigates risks if any potential vulnerabilities have been resolved with your latest version. To write a great release note, be as specific as possible. For example: Briefly describe new functionality. Give an example of the value it provides, and link to more detailed information. Don't use vague wording such as \"various bug fixes.\" Instead, clearly state what has been improved, so readers will know if an issue they’ve experienced has been resolved. New release notes category This information is primarily for the Tech Docs team's use. To add a new release notes category, update the following areas of the docs site. (You do not need to update the releaseNote.js or releaseNoteLandingPage.js files in the nav/templates folder.) Before you submit your pull request to the GitHub docs site, check that the landing pages and placeholder release note build correctly in your localhost. Category landing page In /src/content/docs/release-notes, add the following: A folder for your new release notes category. The RSS feed link, page format, and date order for release notes listed on this page are generated automatically. For example, see the C SDK category landing page format. An index.mdx file in your new folder containing the subject. The subject is the name that will appear on the Release notes landing page. A placeholder release note in this folder for the agent team to fill out. If used, the downloadLink field in the release note will be formatted automatically in the published release note. Before the new category goes live, check with the team's Product Marketing Management (PMM) rep whether they want to include the link in an upcoming What's new post. Landing page In /src/content/docs/release-notes/index.mdx, add a new tile section in alphabetical order for your release notes category. Example: <TechTile name=\"Logs\" icon=\"logo-newrelic\" to=\"/docs/release-notes/logs-release-notes\" /> Copy Logos come from @newrelic/gatsby-theme-newrelic/icons/logo/. If a logo does not already exist for the new agent, use the standard logo-newrelic icon or an image in @newrelic/gatsby-theme-newrelic/icons/feathers.js. If you need other options, talk to the team's designer. Links from other categories Add a link to your new release notes category in the agent's documentation, typically in its Get started category. For more information, see our documentation about docs in multiple menus. Optional: Add a link in the agent's landing page text by updating the index.mdx file in its taxonomy.",

      "body": "This doc contains information and procedures pertaining to the structure of the docs site, including: the nav files, the sidebar, docs category (index) views, and more. For succinct instructions, see Procedures, but it is highly recommended you understand the general concepts of how the docs site structure works if you will be doing larger docs site projects. Terms When talking about the docs site structure, sometimes people use different words for the same things. Below is a list of terms that can help us communicate about the docs site structure: Nav files: In the github docs site, there are yaml files under the nav folder that are used to determine the docs site structure that we display. This structure is exposed in the docs site left sidebar and when you view docs category views (also known as index views, like this one). Folder: In this context, \"folders\" refers to the actual docs site folder structure (those folders and files in the content section). Referring to \"folders\" can be a helpful way to differentiate between the actual folder structure and the displayed structure that's set using the nav files. Sidebar: On public-facing docs, the sidebar is what is visible on the left hand side, showing the structure of that category of docs. The sidebar and index view are both determined by the structure set in the nav file. Category or sub-category: we use these words a bit interchangeably to refer to specific areas of the docs site. For example, this view shows a list of docs in a specific category, as does this higher level category view. In this doc, we'll often use the phrase \"category view\" to indicate a page load of a specific category of docs. Auto-index pages: This is another way, the more technical way, to refer to a category view of docs (for example, this view). \"Auto-index page\" and \"category view\" are used a bit interchangably in this doc, with \"category view\" being used as it's more informal and easy to parse. (Note that this use of \"index\" is a different use of \"index\" than the authored index.mdx files, which are used to display landing pages.) Understand how the docs site structure works This section will explain some of the logic behind how the docs site structure is determined and how the structure we display to the public relates to the actual docs folder structure. How is the displayed structure related to the actual folders? The actual docs folder structure (the folders and mdx files in the content folder) is entirely separate from the docs site structure in the sidebar. The displayed structure of the docs site is determined solely by the nav files (the yaml-format files in the nav folder). It's important to understand the above point. The divergence of the docs folder structure and the displayed docs site structure is necessary: we need a way to control the displayed site structure, which is used for the sidebar and auto-index pages, without requiring us to keep the folder structure and folder names and doc file names completely parallel and matching. Because these two things are so separate, it means we have some fairly complex behind-the-scenes logic to get them to work together. And this means that there can be fairly unintuitive aspects of how that logic works. We do have procedures for common use cases, but it will help you a lot to understand the specifics below of how the displayed structure is generated. What determines a doc's URL? Where a doc file (mdx file) is located in the content folder, and the associated folder and file names, are the only factors that govern that doc's URL. For example, consider the following doc file automated-user-provisioning-single-sign.mdx: This doc's URL is solely based on its folder location and the names of the folders. In this case, its URL is: docs.newrelic.com/docs/accounts/accounts/automated-user-management/automated-user-provisioning-single-sign Copy This has important implications, including: When you move a doc from one folder to another, its URL changes, and this means that you will have to add a redirect to that doc of its original URL. If you rename an mdx file name or a folder name, that changes its URL, so that means you would have to add a redirect to that doc for its original URL. What does a nav file do? The nav files are quite simple. A nav file controls these things: The docs structure (the various levels of docs) for that category of docs. The category headers, set by title (for example, On-host integrations list) and path (for example, /docs/integrations/on-host-integrations). The doc information, set by title (for example, NGINX integration) and path (the doc's URL). A category and a doc in a nav file have the same elements: a title and a `path. What separates a category from a doc is that: A category contains docs in the level below it. If a category has a path (which isn't required but should be present for most docs), the path points to a content docs folder that has at least one doc in it. For more on nav file format, see Nav file format Where is the docs site structure exposed? The structure set in the nav files is exposed in two places: The left sidebar of a doc that shows the structure of that category. When a category header in the sidebar is clicked, it shows a view of that docs site category. Doc category views, also sometimes called auto-index pages: for example, this view, which shows a particular section of docs. What determines a doc's sidebar? As stated above, the sidebar is just one way that the docs site structure governed by the nav files is exposed. When a doc is loaded, the docs site searches for that URL in the nav files. If it finds a match, it displays that nav file in the sidebar with that doc highlighted. If it finds that doc in more than one nav file, it attempts to find the right nav file by choosing the nav that matches the top level category in the doc URL. For example, if a doc with a relative URL /docs/accounts/accounts-billing/account-setup/create-your-new-relic-account was in two nav files, the docs site code would search to see if one of the nav files has docs/accounts as its first path field. If it finds a match, it uses that nav file. For an example of a doc that is placed in two different nav files, for this auto-index page click the Manage data doc and see how, when it loads, it displays the sidebar for the nav file that better matches its URL. When you click a sidebar category, what determines how that auto-index page displays? When you click on a docs category header in the sidebar and an auto-index page loads (like this one), what governs what is displayed there? Here is how this process works: A category header in the sidebar has an associated URL, which is set in the nav file. In the example nav file snippet below, the Get started category view has a path set to /docs/apis/intro-apis. This is what governs the sidebar heading title of \"Get started\" and tells it the URL to use. - title: APIs path: /docs/apis pages: - title: Get started path: /docs/apis/intro-apis pages: - title: New Relic APIs path: /docs/apis/intro-apis/introduction-new-relic-apis - title: API keys path: /docs/apis/intro-apis/new-relic-api-keys Copy If the associated folder of that path has an index mdx file (representing a landing page, like this one), the docs site displays that landing page. If there is no landing page, we display the docs and structure contained in that section of the nav file. For example, this view is based on the nav file section under that category header. For this to work correctly, the docs site verifies that that path matches an actual docs site folder that has at least one mdx file. Put another way: if we used a completely arbitrary URL path for a category's path, like docs/random-category/random-category-2, it would not work. To display a nav file, the path requires an existing folder with at least one doc in there. Other aspects to consider: A path is not required. A category header in the nav file does not require a path; that is just what tells it to create a link and a URL for that view. If a category in a nav file lacks a path, it won't have a link or associated URL for it (for an example, see the \"New Relic University\" category in this section). Having a category without an associated link/URL can be an acceptable choice if you are creating a category of docs that don't reside in that section and you simply want to give a helpful category view in the sidebar. Folder structure URLs aren't important. Every folder in the docs site can be the basis for a URL, but we should only consider valuable the URLs we've chosen for inclusion in the nav files. For example, here's a URL based on an actual folder containing one doc. But because there is no path in a nav file corresponding to that URL, it doesn't display anything. Nav file format Below is a snippet of the agents.yml nav file. Note that the file has indentation that corresponds to the level of the navigation hierarchy. When making changes or creating a new nav file, be sure to use the existing spacing format. yml title: Agents path: /docs/agents pages: - title: Manage APM agents path: /docs/agents/manage-apm-agents pages: - title: Agent data path: /docs/agents/manage-apm-agents/agent-data pages: - title: Real time streaming path: /docs/agents/manage-apm-agents/agent-data/real-time-streaming - title: Custom instrumentation path: /docs/agents/manage-apm-agents/agent-data/custom-instrumentation - title: Agent attributes path: /docs/agents/manage-apm-agents/agent-data/agent-attributes - title: Custom events path: /docs/agents/manage-apm-agents/agent-data/collect-custom-events - title: Custom metrics path: /docs/agents/manage-apm-agents/agent-data/collect-custom-metrics - title: Manage errors path: /docs/agents/manage-apm-agents/agent-data/manage-errors-apm-collect-ignore-or-mark-expected - title: Link Kubernetes path: /docs/agents/manage-apm-agents/agent-data/link-your-applications-kubernetes - title: App naming pages: - title: Name your application path: /docs/agents/manage-apm-agents/app-naming/name-your-application - title: Use multiple names for an app path: /docs/agents/manage-apm-agents/app-naming/use-multiple-names-app Copy Tip Navigation nesting is currently limited to a maximum of six levels deep. Please reach out to the engineering team if that is not enough. Here are important elements of the nav file: Key Required? Description title yes The text shown in the navigation, either of a doc or a category. path yes The URL path to the doc or the category view. Do not use trailing slashes. For docs categories in the nav file, the path is required to create an index view. Without the path, a docs category won't be clickable as a link and won't display a view of those docs. Learn more about index views. rootNav no rootNav controls whether a nav file will be displayed or hidden on the docs site home page. It is enabled by default. If you want to hide a category from the home page (as we do for our style guide docs, for example), you would set this to false, as shown below: title: Style guide path: /docs/style-guide Copy children no This is hardly ever used. It indicates a sub-navigation node. Procedures Below are instructions for several common procedures. It may help you to review the terms we use before starting a procedure. Procedures include: Add a new docs category Add a doc to sidebar/nav-file Move docs between folders or categories Move or delete folders Create a \"dummy\" category for docs that don’t live in that area Make a category heading clickable Troubleshoot messed up category views Overview of steps for a large docs site restructure project For some smaller docs site edits, you can sometimes simply edit the nav files and not have to touch the doc files or folders. But for larger projects, you may want to or need to edit and move the docs files and folders themselves. Below is a broad overview of the chunks of work such larger projects generally entail. Plan out what the new nav file structure will look like, and plan out the work of moving docs files or creating new folders. It can help to write down the chunks of work a large project will entail. Move the affected doc files to their new folder locations, making sure to add redirects. For more on that, see Move docs between folders. Delete any empty folders. Edit the nav files to reflect the new desired structure and point to the new doc URLs. If there are category header path URLs that are no longer needed, add those URLs as redirects to specific docs (preferred) or the taxonomy redirects file. For more specific and granular procedures, keep reading. Add a new category We'll explain two procedures: adding a subcategory of docs in an existing nav file, and adding an entirely new nav file. Add a new nav file Adding an entirely new nav file should be rare, and something we only do occasionally during large overhauls of site structure. To add an entirely new nav file: Copy an existing file nav file, or create a new nav file. Customize the new nav file with the categories and docs you want, using the structure of existing nav files as a template. For more on structure, see nav format. Tip You need at least one level of nesting inside the nav file. Without that, doc titles in the auto-generated category views will render as H2 headings. For example, src/content/level-one/level-two/doc will work, but src/content/level-one/doc will produce strange formatting. Add a new category to a nav file To add a new category to a nav file: In an existing nav file, add a new category, represented by its title and path. If you're adding a path for that category (recommended), it must use the URL of an existing folder with at least one mdx file in it. Add the docs you want in that section. Ensure your new content matches the indenting of the surrounding nav file. To learn more about how this works, see: How a doc's sidebar is determined How a doc category view is determined If a category view isn't clickable, see Make category view clickable. Add a doc to sidebar/nav-file Once you create a doc, you need to place it in one or more nav files. To do this: In the nav file location where you want to locate it, add the title (its short title displayed in the sidebar and category views) and the path, which is the doc's URL. Ensure that you've emulated the indenting based on the surrounding nav file content or other nav files. Add doc in multiple sidebar locations To add a doc in more than one sidebar location, simply add that doc (its title and path) wherever you want it to be in the nav file. For more on how the sidebar is determined for docs in multiple nav files, see Sidebar. You can add a doc URL in multiple nav file locations. Move docs to other categories Because the nav file and the actual folder structure aren't connected, there are two different ways to \"move docs\": Move a doc in the nav files: preferred and most common procedure. Move a doc between folders: less frequent, mainly when doing larger projects where we want to do a significant overhaul of the docs structure and want to ensure the folder structure doesn't become too divergent from the nav file structure. Move docs using nav file Move a doc in the nav file when you want to change where it's visible in the sidebar menus. To move a doc from one place to another in the nav file: In the first nav file, copy the two rows representing that doc's entry (the title and path lines) and paste that content into the place you want it to live in the new nav file. In the new nav file section, make sure that new content is aligned properly with the surrounding nav file content. See Nav format for more about nav file structure. Move docs between folders Note that moving docs between the folders should be relatively rare. The main reasons to do this are when the folder structure and nav file structure are becoming very different, which can be bad for a couple reasons: Too much divergence can create issues with category view displays or sidebar actions. Too much divergence can make finding and editing docs harder, so there can be value to keeping things fairly up to date and parallel. When you move a doc between folders or rename a doc, that changes its URL. Similarly, if you rename a folder, that changes the URL of all docs in that area. To move a doc between folders: Get the current URL of the doc you want to move and add that URL to its own list of redirects. Tips: One way to do this in VSCode is to right click the file and click \"Get relative path\". If you are moving many files, ask the team about ways to programmatically add redirects. Remove the trailing slash. Move the doc to the new folder. Update nav files with the new URL. This is easily overlooked but having the correct doc URL in the nav file, and not a redirect, is important. Note that a doc URL may be in more than one nav file so searching the site for that URL can help. Move or delete a folder Sometimes when we are doing a larger restructuring project, we may want to move or delete the actual folders instead of simply editing the nav files. If you are moving an entire folder or multiple folders to another folder, docs and all: Move the folder on your local disk to the new location (in Finder, for example). Next, because that move changes all the URLs of the docs and categories, you'll need to add redirects: For adding redirects for docs, see the procedures for moving a doc between folders. For category redirects: For the section of the nav file affected by your folder editing, gather all the category URLs (path fields) that relate to the moved or deleted folders. We don't need to redirect all folder-related URL paths: we only need to redirect the nav file paths because those represent the paths that we actually link to in the docs (in other words: we aren't using folder-based URLs if they don't have a nav file path). Add those category path URLs as redirects in specific docs or, if that won't work, in the taxonomy-redirects file. We should aim to add category redirects in specific docs and the reason for this is that the taxonomy-redirects file is hard to use and because it's a better customer experience to land on a doc versus a category if possible. In most cases, you'll be able to find a fitting doc to redirect to but if only a category view makes sense, use the taxonomy redirects file. For larger projects, this can be tough work, so you'll want to check out the build and make sure all the sidebar links and category headers are working as expected. For deleting folders, you'll want to essentially follow the same steps as above: either moving or deleting the docs in those folders first, gathering the affected category path URLs and adding them as redirects, adn then deleting the empty folders. Create a \"dummy\" sub-category of docs that don't live in that category Sometimes you want to create a category of docs that is there to help expose a related doc or set of docs. For example, in this view, we have added a category for 'New Relic University' even though that's not a doc that lives in that section; in this case, it's not even a doc on our site. In the example above, this 'New Relic University' category header is in regular text and not a link, and that's because it doesn't have a path set for it in the nav file. This also means that in the sidebar, this category header is not a clickable link and simply functions as a collapser/expander. This is acceptable if you don't mind it but below we explain how you can get a clickable category if you need it. To create a so-called \"dummy\" category: Add the category structure you want in the nav file. If you're okay not having a clickable category header, your new category doesn't require a path. If you want a clickable category header, you will need to use or create a folder that matches the new category path and that has at least one mdx file in it (details). In the nav file, add the title and path information for the docs you want in that new category. Test your new category to ensure it is working correctly. Make a sidebar category heading clickable If there's a sidebar category that's only acting as an expander/collapser and doesn't have a link, that's because it either a) doesn't have a path set in the nav file, or b) that path goes to a folder that doesn't have a doc in it. For more on this, see the instructions regarding clickable headers in the \"dummy\" category section. Troubleshoot category views not working correctly If a docs category view is not working correctly, review how category views are formed. If this does happen, get another opinion from another tech writer to make sure you're not missing something, as we should rarely have problems. One reason that a category view might not work is specifically for path URLs that are also landing pages. In this case, if that path is used in more than one location in the same nav file, the docs site can be confused about which category view to use. We may fix this with a coding fix but in meantime: consider pointing to other URLs and not that path, so that there's only one use of that path per nav file.",

      "body": "A well-chosen screenshot or image can greatly improve the readability and clarity of a doc. Too many images or an image that's tough to parse can really slow things down. If you're not part of the Tech Docs team and you want to add an image to the docs site, create a GitHub issue. If you're a New Relic employee, contact @hero in the documentation Slack channel. Add an image We want to ensure that sensitive data does not appear in UI screenshots. That's why we recommend that you provide a permalink to a test account. Do not take a screenshot from your New Relic account. Here are some things to keep in mind when you're creating an image: Make sure your image provides useful information at a glance. Include a caption with helpful context for the image. For screenshot captions, include the path in bold. For video captions, include the approximate running time. Our doc site images are stored in individual images directories at the root level of each taxonomy category. These images directories contain all the images used in the docs for that category. To add an image from scratch: Find the images folder for your doc. For example, if your doc lives in the docs/style-guide/processes-procedures directory, use the docs/style-guide/processes-procedures/images folder. If the images directory does not exist in the directory where your doc lives, use VScode or Finder to create a folder in that directory named images (must be lower case and plural). Place your image in the images directory. Give the image a descriptive file name; for example, fso-ui-overview.png is much better than 123-go-dawgs.png. Continue with the following procedure to embed the image in a doc. Embed an image Use markdown to embed an image in a doc. The basic structure: ![alt text](PATH_TO_IMAGE \"Image title text\") Copy Here's a filled in example: ![An image showing an overview of the synthetic monitoring UI](./images/synthetics-ui-overview.png \"Synthetics UI overview\") Copy Update an image To update an image: Delete the original image file in the corresponding images directory. Place the new image file in the same images directory. Ensure the image file has the same name as the original file. Write image captions Descriptive captions help the reader know why the image matters. If it's a screenshot, it's helpful to include the path in bold in addition to a description. For example: ![Dashboards in New Relic One](./images/NR1-dashboards-image.png \"Dashboards in New Relic One\") <figcaption> **[one.newrelic.com](https://one.newrelic.com) > Dashboards**: Quickly create information-dense custom views into the data that matters most to you with dashboards in New Relic One. </figcaption> Copy For more help with captions and other supporting text around images, see Guidelines for explaining images. Add an inline image To use an inline image, add something like this: The UI includes a multiple app names indicator. ![Multiple app names indicator in New Relic One](./images/new-relic-distributed-tracing-multiapp-icon.png \"Multiple apps name indicator in New Relic One\") Copy If the inline image is being used as an icon, always describe it first. When you embed the icon image, follow the image with the word icon in the text. For example: Select your app's settings ![settings icon](./images/icon-settings.png \"settings icon\") icon. Copy Add a fixed width, block level image Fixed width, block level images are similar in format to full column width images, except the original image width is smaller than the column width (800px) of a page. It's important that you edit the HTML like you would an inline image. This way the image will be rendered at 100% of the column width and also be responsive to smaller screen sizes. Use these images when a screenshot is a small part of the page with a width of less than 800px, but when it still needs a caption like a full width image. Here's an example of the HTML for a fixed width, block level image: <div style=\"width: 100%; max-width: Npx;\"> <img alt=\"ALT TEXT\" height=\"X\" src=\"IMG_URL\" title=\"FILENAME\" width=\"N\"> </div> <div class=\"dnd-legend-wrapper\" style=\"width: 100%; max-width: Npx;\"> <div class=\"meta\"><p>CAPTION TEXT</p></div> </div> Copy Icons You can choose from a variety of icons to include in your docs: Feather icons (prefixed with 'fe-), which replace our previous Font Awesome icons New Relic icons (prefixed with nr-) Logos for third-party products (prefixed with logo-) To see if we already have an icon you need, go to: Feather.js for docs-website in GitHub: These are the Feather icons available in the docs-website project but are not included in the Gatsby theme. Gatsby theme for docs-website in GitHub: This is a subset of Feather, New Relic, and product logo icons that are available across the developer and docs sites. You can use any icons you need in the Gatsby theme or Feather. Currently these locations have separate, non-overlapping buckets of icons. Insert icons as tag attributes If your icon appears as an attribute inside another tag, prefix it with icon as in this example: <LandingPageTileGrid> <LandingPageTile title=\"AWS Lambda\" href=\"/docs/serverless-function-monitoring/aws-lambda-monitoring/get-started/monitoring-aws-lambda-serverless-monitoring\" icon=\"logo-aws\" > </LandingPageTile> Copy Insert inline icons If your icon appears inside running text, use the <Icon> component. Here are some examples: Feather: <Icon name=\"fe-database\" /> New Relic: <Icon name=\"nr-tdp\" /> Logos: <Icon name=\"logo-apple\" /> Install new Feather icons If you don't see the icon you want in either the Gatsby theme for docs-website in GitHub or in the Feather.js for docs-website in GitHub, you can add a new icon to the Gatsby theme. You can also ask developers to add the icon you want. Here's an example of adding a database icon: Go to feathericons.com. Download the database feather icon by clicking on the icon itself. Once downloaded, open the SVG file in your text editor. Copy the \"guts\" of the SVG, which is everything in between the <svg> tags. For example, if the SVG is <svg><path m=\"1\"></path></svg>, then copy only the <path m=\"1\"></path> portion. Open the list of feather icons at src/@newrelic/gatsby-theme-newrelic/icons/feather.js. Add an entry for database, and assign the code from the previous step to it. If the icon has multiple paths, include the <> wrapper around it like you see with other icons. Save the feather.js file. The fe- prefix gets added automatically. Once that icon is added, you can use it with the icon component; for example, <Icon name=\"fe-database\" />.",

The page that opens is index.js, the file that manages the parts of the home page, but not the content. It's rare that you'll need to make changes to this file. Most home page changes will be to add a new tile or section to the page, or update links. These types of changes are handled in two files: src/data/homepage.yml - contains home page section titles, section descriptions, and the URLs for tiles. src/i18n/translations/en/translation.json - contains tile info, including the title and short description of tiles. Update a link's URL Change or add new links using homepage.yml. In homepage.yml, search for the link you want to change. Edit the URL, save, commit, and PR the change. Add a new tile to the home page You'll make changes to both homepage.yml and translations.json On the translations.json doc, find the spot where you want to add the new tile (which section, and in what order you want it to appear), and add a new entry with this format: \"t#\": { \"title\": \"tile name\", \"description\": \"Short description.\" }, Copy Make sure you update the number on the tile. If you want to insert it in the middle of a group, update all the subsequent tile numbers as well. Save the file. Open homepage.yml, find the spot where the new tile will be, and add a new line with the relative link for the new tile. For example, - /docs/new-relic-one/use-new-relic-one/workloads/workloads-isolate-resolve-incidents-faster Save and check that your new tile builds properly on a local build. Commit, push, PR when you're ready. Add a new section to the home page On the translations.json page, add a new section modeled in the spot where you want the new section to appear. Include at least one title. For example, here's the TDP entry, with one tile: \"errors-inbox\": { \"title\": \"Errors Inbox\", \"description\": \"A single place to proactively detect, triage, and take action on all the errors before they impact customers.\", \"t1\": { \"title\": \"Introduction to Errors Inbox\", \"description\": \"How to manage all your monitoring in one place.\" }, Copy When you're done creating the info, save the file. In the homepage.yml page, find the corresponding location for the new section, and add the short name you provided in the translation.json file, title, description, and tile URLs.

Edit the home page left nav The left nav of the home page is controlled by src/nav/root.yml. This is a basic yml file, similar to our taxonomy files.

      "body": "As tech doc writers (TW) we edit docs, do peer edits, or use the Docs Team GitHub board to track the status of issues and pull requests (PR). Who is who in an issue/PR? GitHub keeps track of all activity concerning an issue or PR, including, of course, the people involved. When a new issue or PR is filed, check on the filer’s username and see if they're listed as a member of the New Relic organization. If they aren't, try to find them on Slack based on their username. If you're not sure about someone's affiliation, treat them as external until you know otherwise. People in an issue/PR include: Creator: The person who opened the issue or PR. This could be a writer, a Relic, or an external user. We'll label the issue or PR differently depending on who created it. If you're not sure if a user is a Relic, a good trick is to click on their profile and see if they're a member of the New Relic GitHub org. Assignee: The person taking responsibility for a PR or issue. This will usually be used by the Hero or Sidekick to assign non-TW PRs and issues to themselves. It can also be used to take a TW’s PR or issue over from them. Reviewer: The person who reviews or peer edits the code/document and approves the changes. Not necessarily the person responsible for that area or responsible for merging the commit. You can pre-assign up to 100 reviewers to a given issue. Track issues in the board The docs board has the following columns: Column Description Needs triage The Hero or Sidekick review and label issues and PRs in this column, then drag them to the appropriate column. If a PR or issue is labeled eng, the Hero/Sidekick can go ahead and click its ellipses icon to archive it. Hero: to do PRs that the Hero needs to review, publish, and follow up with SMEs as needed. Hero: Assign yourself as Assignee. In review (Hero or any TW) Drag PRs to this column when they are being reviewed. This shows who is reviewing and what is being reviewed, so two writers don’t mistakenly work on the same PR. Any TW: Writer needs PR review PRs from Tech Docs team members that need a light edit pass to make sure everything in GitHub is correct. This should be checked by other writers every few hours so PRs don’t get stale. If you have a PR that’s been lingering here too long, ask for a reviewer in #doc_sprint_talk. Whoever takes it: assign yourself as Reviewer. Any TW: needs peer edit Like our Needs Peer Edit column in Jira: A writer has requested a review of their PR. Review their PR in GitHub and leave comments. Whoever takes it: assign yourself as Reviewer. Waiting on SME/Blocked For PRs that are blocked by need for SME info or confirmation (for example, as Hero you are waiting on an answer from the person who sent in a Hero pull request). Waiting on TW to merge All reviews are complete. The TW who created the PR (or who is assigned the issue) needs to merge this work into develop. Drafts A draft is a way to open a PR while indicating that the work is still in progress and not necessarily ready to merge immediately. You can't merge a Draft PR directly. Instead, you must move it out of draft status first. When you see a draft PR (especially from outside the team!), treat it as though it's a working draft, and reach out to the creator to discuss. Read more on GitHub's drafts. As a Hero, make sure you attend to the following throughout your day: Check in with the previous Hero at the start of your day (especially on Monday at the start of the week). Don’t forget to sync with the BCN Hero if necessary. Watch for incoming PRs in #docs_deploys, and review everything in the Needs triage column. Drag cards from that column to the appropriate column. Work through the cards in the Hero: to do column. Everyone on the team helps keep things moving: All writers should keep an eye on both Any TW columns. There's one column for PRs that need a simpler review before merging (typo fixes, drive-by edits, etc), and another column for PRs that need a peer edit. There are also two blocked columns: One for PRs blocked on a SME, and another column where we're waiting on the TW who created the PR to review feedback and/or merge. After merging, remove your ticket from the board. Deal with references in GitHub (and the style guide) Don't link to anything non-public from a public place. You can reference Jira tickets, but reference tickets by issue key (DOC-1234 is ok) rather than a link (https://newrelic.atlassian.net/browse/DOC-1234 is not). Don't mention traffic or usage numbers publicly. Don't reference internal people by name. If they have a GH account, @mention their GH handle. If they don't, talk instead about teams (\"talk to a browser team engineer\" or \"Support Engineer\") rather than people. You can mention the #documentation channel and hero. Merge releases into main work (or, when do we publish?) The Hero currently merges three times a day: At 9 AM (morning), 12 PM (noon), and 3 PM (evening) Pacific. We merge release branches into main to avoid interuptions when someone merges into develop during a release. To learn more about this workflow, see the gitflow documentation in Atlassian. To start a release: Create a branch based off develop Github Desktop by clicking Current Branch in the top header, clicking New Branch in the dropdown, and then selecting Develop. Name the branch following this pattern: daily-release/mm-dd-yy-morning/noon/evening. Here's an example: daily-release/10-27-21-morning. Push your changes by clicking Push Origin in GitHub Desktop. Create a pull request into main from your new daily release branch by clicking Create Pull Request. This will open a pull request screen on github.com. Pull requests default to merging into develop, so select main as the base branch in the left side of the page and then click Submit Pull Request. Wait until all the checks complete, and then merge the pull request. All branches that follow the daily-release/mm-dd-yy-morning pattern are protected branches. This means the branches can't be deleted or pushed to by non-admins. GitHub labels Every issue needs labels to help us triage and track the health of our backlog: content: Always add, this indicates the issue is content-related rather than a design or engineering issue. pg_*: Always add to indicate the product group. For full definitions, see the \"Doc Jira and GitHub fields\" doc in the internal team Google Drive. Indicate who created the issue: from_internal: A Relic created it. from_external: A user opened it in the repo OR it came in through #customer-feedback process. from_tw: One of us created it (unless we were passing along #customer-feedback). Optionally: docs-issues-migrate: Issues that are too large in scope for the docs team to handle without product team expertise. This label alerts the docs issues team to migrate these issues into the customer feedback channel where they will be triaged and sent to product teams. Jira’d: Issues that have a corresponding Jira ticket. Make sure you leave the Jira number in the comments of the issue (for example, DOC-1234). Every pull request needs these labels so we can see where our contributions come from: content: Always add, this indicates the PR is content-related rather than design or engineering. Indicate who created the pull request: from_internal: A Relic created it. from_external: A user opened it in the repo OR it came in through #customer-feedback process. from_tw: One of us created it (unless we were passing along #customer-feedback). If the PR fixes an external issue, label it as from_tw since the work was done by a tech writer. Check the edit history of a doc or file Use any of these options to check or \"diff\" the history of a file. Option 1: GitHub history tab Navigate to the doc on the doc site and click Edit page in the right nav. Click History in the top right corner of the doc. Option 2: githistory.xy Navigate to your specific file on GitHub.com: https://github.com/newrelic/docs-website/blob/develop/src/content/docs/browser/new-relic-browser/browser-agent-spa-api/add-page-action.mdx Copy In the url, replace github.com with github.githistory.xyz: https://github.githistory.xyz/newrelic/docs-website/blob/develop/src/content/docs/browser/new-relic-browser/browser-agent-spa-api/add-page-action.mdx Copy It will take you to a site which presents the visual history of that specific file. You can view changes by clicking through the commit history at the top of your page. Option 3: Git blame Follow GitHub's documentation. Alternatively, you can use the following command in your terminal: git log --follow \"**/file_name_here.mdx\" Copy This will output the commit history of that file. By default, it only shows the first few commits. You can scroll by pressing Return multiple times. For example, to find the commit history for vmware-vsphere-monitoring-integration.mdx, I would run: git log --follow \"**/vmware-vsphere-monitoring-integration.mdx\" Copy Docs site history before October 2021 We had a large site restructure in October 2021 which lost most of the file history for our docs. You can find an archived version of our site pre-rework in the pre-IA-2021 branch. By navigating the pre-rework version of our repo, you can find file history and more.",

      "body": "A well-chosen screenshot or image can greatly improve the readability and clarity of a doc. Too many images or an image that's tough to parse can really slow things down. If you're not part of the Tech Docs team and you want to add an image to the docs site, create a GitHub issue. If you're a New Relic employee, contact @hero in the documentation Slack channel. Add an image We want to ensure that sensitive data does not appear in UI screenshots. That's why we recommend that you provide a permalink to a test account. Do not take a screenshot from your New Relic account. Here are some things to keep in mind when you're creating an image: Make sure your image provides useful information at a glance. Include a caption with helpful context for the image. For screenshot captions, include the path in bold. For video captions, include the approximate running time. Our doc site images are stored in individual images directories at the root level of each taxonomy category. These images directories contain all the images used in the docs for that category. To add an image from scratch: Find the images folder for your doc. For example, if your doc lives in the docs/style-guide/processes-procedures directory, use the docs/style-guide/processes-procedures/images folder. If the images directory does not exist in the directory where your doc lives, use VScode or Finder to create a folder in that directory named images (must be lower case and plural). Place your image in the images directory. Give the image a descriptive file name; for example, fso-ui-overview.png is much better than 123-go-dawgs.png. Continue with the following procedure to embed the image in a doc. Embed an image Use markdown to embed an image in a doc. The basic structure: ![alt text](PATH_TO_IMAGE \"Image title text\") Copy Here's a filled in example: ![An image showing an overview of the synthetic monitoring UI](./images/synthetics-ui-overview.png \"Synthetics UI overview\") Copy Update an image To update an image: Delete the original image file in the corresponding images directory. Place the new image file in the same images directory. Ensure the image file has the same name as the original file. Write image captions Descriptive captions help the reader know why the image matters. If it's a screenshot, it's helpful to include the path in bold in addition to a description. For example: ![Dashboards in New Relic One](./images/NR1-dashboards-image.png \"Dashboards in New Relic One\") <figcaption> **[one.newrelic.com](https://one.newrelic.com) > Dashboards**: Quickly create information-dense custom views into the data that matters most to you with dashboards in New Relic One. </figcaption> Copy For more help with captions and other supporting text around images, see Guidelines for explaining images. Add an inline image To use an inline image, add something like this: The UI includes a multiple app names indicator. ![Multiple app names indicator in New Relic One](./images/new-relic-distributed-tracing-multiapp-icon.png \"Multiple apps name indicator in New Relic One\") Copy If the inline image is being used as an icon, always describe it first. When you embed the icon image, follow the image with the word icon in the text. For example: Select your app's settings ![settings icon](./images/icon-settings.png \"settings icon\") icon. Copy Add a fixed width, block level image Fixed width, block level images are similar in format to full column width images, except the original image width is smaller than the column width (800px) of a page. It's important that you edit the HTML like you would an inline image. This way the image will be rendered at 100% of the column width and also be responsive to smaller screen sizes. Use these images when a screenshot is a small part of the page with a width of less than 800px, but when it still needs a caption like a full width image. Here's an example of the HTML for a fixed width, block level image: <div style=\"width: 100%; max-width: Npx;\"> <img alt=\"ALT TEXT\" height=\"X\" src=\"IMG_URL\" title=\"FILENAME\" width=\"N\"> </div> <div class=\"dnd-legend-wrapper\" style=\"width: 100%; max-width: Npx;\"> <div class=\"meta\"><p>CAPTION TEXT</p></div> </div> Copy Icons You can choose from a variety of icons to include in your docs: Feather icons (prefixed with 'fe-), which replace our previous Font Awesome icons New Relic icons (prefixed with nr-) Logos for third-party products (prefixed with logo-) To see if we already have an icon you need, go to: Feather.js for docs-website in GitHub: These are the Feather icons available in the docs-website project but are not included in the Gatsby theme. Gatsby theme for docs-website in GitHub: This is a subset of Feather, New Relic, and product logo icons that are available across the developer and docs sites. You can use any icons you need in the Gatsby theme or Feather. Currently these locations have separate, non-overlapping buckets of icons. Insert icons as tag attributes If your icon appears as an attribute inside another tag, prefix it with icon as in this example: <LandingPageTileGrid> <LandingPageTile title=\"AWS Lambda\" href=\"/docs/serverless-function-monitoring/aws-lambda-monitoring/get-started/monitoring-aws-lambda-serverless-monitoring\" icon=\"logo-aws\" > </LandingPageTile> Copy Insert inline icons If your icon appears inside running text, use the <Icon> component. Here are some examples: Feather: <Icon name=\"fe-database\" /> New Relic: <Icon name=\"nr-tdp\" /> Logos: <Icon name=\"logo-apple\" /> Install new Feather icons If you don't see the icon you want in either the Gatsby theme for docs-website in GitHub or in the Feather.js for docs-website in GitHub, you can add a new icon to the Gatsby theme. You can also ask developers to add the icon you want. Here's an example of adding a database icon: Go to feathericons.com. Download the database feather icon by clicking on the icon itself. Once downloaded, open the SVG file in your text editor. Copy the \"guts\" of the SVG, which is everything in between the <svg> tags. For example, if the SVG is <svg><path m=\"1\"></path></svg>, then copy only the <path m=\"1\"></path> portion. Open the list of feather icons at src/@newrelic/gatsby-theme-newrelic/icons/feather.js. Add an entry for database, and assign the code from the previous step to it. If the icon has multiple paths, include the <> wrapper around it like you see with other icons. Save the feather.js file. The fe- prefix gets added automatically. Once that icon is added, you can use it with the icon component; for example, <Icon name=\"fe-database\" />.",

      "body": "Are you having problems working on a doc in GitHub? Check out the following common issues. GitHub authentication fails If you suddenly find that you can no longer push to your remote branch in GitHub Desktop, you may have developed a problem with SSH. If logging out of GitHub Desktop via Preferences doesn’t seem to help, you can confirm if you have an SSH issue by switching to the command line and trying to push manually. For example: git push --set-upstream origin second-kafka-pr-for-issue-1123 If this command prompts you for a passphrase, your SSH was somehow confused. By entering your passphrase, you should be back in business. If you can’t remember your passphrase, check out this article. My build is failing mysteriously Here’s a few things you can check if your build is failing: Indenting in the nav files Front matter If there's apostrophes and colons in frontmatter fields, surround them with quotes to avoid problems. Missing closed brackets or tags Poorly formatted image links Be careful when renaming images and their filename paths. A mismatch can cause the entire local build to fail. Be especially careful when dealing with image files that are imported. Image filenames Image filenames are case-sensitive. Using the wrong capitalization results in a missing image in the doc. Images with encoded values (like %) in the filename can be especially tricky, try to avoid them. Diagnose markdown errors with yarn-verify If you know which file is causing an error, you can further troubleshoot with the yarn verify-mdx path/to/file.mdx command. This command returns more information about the error than the normal Gatsby output. This includes things such as the specific character and line number causing the error. Example: Troubleshoot with yarn-verify Let's pretend I've made a changes to multiple docs in my branch. When I try to either run the site locally or access the Gatsby Cloud build, I get the following error: Unexpected character = (U+003D) before name, expected a character that can start a name, such as a letter, $, or _/usr/src/app/www/src/content/docs/new-relic-solutions/observability-maturity/uptime-performance-reliability/aqm-implementation-guide.mdx: Unexpected character = (U+003D) before name, expected a character that can start a name, such as a letter, $, or _ Copy The error does tell me that the doc with an error is /docs/new-relic-solutions/observability-maturity/uptime-performance-reliability/aqm-implementation-guide.mdx. Other than that, all I know is that there is a = character messing things up somewhere. Cool, but this is a NRQL doc, there are a dozens of = characters. So, I run yarn verify-mdx src/content/docs/new-relic-solutions/observability-maturity/uptime-performance-reliability/aqm-implementation-guide.mdx. This returns the following: reading src/content/docs/new-relic-solutions/observability-maturity/uptime-performance-reliability/aqm-implementation-guide.mdx { \"message\": \"Unexpected character `=` (U+003D) before name, expected a character that can start a name, such as a letter, `$`, or `_`\", \"name\": \"284:227\", \"reason\": \"Unexpected character `=` (U+003D) before name, expected a character that can start a name, such as a letter, `$`, or `_`\", \"line\": 284, \"column\": 227, \"location\": { \"start\": { \"line\": 284, \"column\": 227, \"offset\": 19129, \"index\": 1 }, \"end\": { \"line\": null, \"column\": null } }, \"source\": \"remark-mdx\", \"ruleId\": \"unexpected-character\", \"fatal\": true } [ Copy In this case, the relvant info is: \"line\": 284, \"column\": 227, Copy and \"source\": \"remark-mdx\", \"ruleId\": \"unexpected-character\", \"fatal\": true Copy This tells me that there is an unexpected character in line 284, column 227. Then I can go to that section of the doc and further troubleshoot, knowing exactly where the error comes from. In this case, I likely just need to wrap a NRQL example in quotes. Issues with the local site If you're running with issues with your local build, try these options: Stop and restart yarn In the terminal, ensure you're in the /docs-website directory. Hit CONTROL+C to interrupt the yarn process, if necessary. Run yarn && yarn start. Ensure the problem isn't with your branch In the terminal, ensure you're in the docs-website directory. Hit CONTROL+C to stop yarn, if necessary. In GitHub Desktop, commit any changes needed on your branch, and then switch to the Develop branch. Back in the terminal, run yarn && yarn start. If the site now builds correctly, the issue is with the changes in your branch. Stop Yarn again, go back to your branch, and troubleshoot. Clean your local cache Run yarn clean to blow away your local cache. This will make your next build slower, so make sure you have time! In the terminal, ensure you're in the docs-website directory. Hit CONTROL+C to stop yarn, if necessary. Begin a new build by running yarn clean && yarn && yarn start. Remove corrupted cache files There may be times when your .cache directory has been corrupted. This directory is ignored by Git, which means that it travels with you from branch to branch. This might be the problem if your local builds are failing regardless of which branch you’re on. To solve this from your /docs-website directory, run rm -rf .cache. Start a build from start Blow away all your node modules, hidden .cache folder, and local cache and start a build from scratch. This takes a long time to run, around 10–20 minutes. In the terminal, ensure you're in the docs-website directory. Hit CONTROL+C to stop yarn, if necessary. Blow away modules and cache and start from scratch by running the kknuke Keyboard Maestro command, or run yarn reboot in your terminal. Important If you use the kknuke Keyboard Maestro command, when everything completes, start the site by running yarn start. Run your local build in private mode Sometimes the local site builds, but pages within the site don't. Running the local build in a private/incognito session may to fix this issue. You can also try clearing out your browser's cache. My redirect throws a 404 error when testing it locally Redirects are a bit strange on local builds. To test them, navigate to the page that is being redirected, wait until it throws a 404, and then wait ~1-2 minutes. It should redirect you after a while. If it doesn’t, ensure you set up the redirect correctly. You can also test the redirects out in the Gatsby build. A check fails in the PR Important The only checks needed to merge a PR are the checks marked as required on the PR. These are run linter, run tests, license/cla, and unpaired translations removed for merges to develop, and build the docs site for merges to main. If a required check fails, the failure must be addressed in order for the PR to be merged. If an optional check fails, reach out in the help channel so that the hero can look into the failure, but feel free to merge the PR since optional checks don't block releases. Rarely, a build or check will fail due to some internal error. You can re-run the check by going to the PR, clicking Details, and then clicking Re-run jobs. If that doesn't fix it, you probably have genuine build errors. Pull down locally and troubleshoot. Reset the 'build the docs site' build check Caution This adds a LOT of time to the build check. There are times when this check fails. If this happens after your local builds have built successfully, you may need to force a rebuild of the cache. In your local repo, find the file gatsby-config.js (use CMD-P to jump to it fast in VSCode). Swap the first and second line of code. It doesn’t matter what order these lines are in, except to make the Gatsby Build check rebuild the cache. const fs = require('fs'); const parse = require('rehype-parse'); Save the file and commit the change to your PR. Re-run the build checks. Wait a LOOOOONG time. Troubleshoot merging conflicts Merge conflicts can seem pretty scary, but it’s ultimately just deciding between two different versions of a doc. Here are some tips on how to get through it. Fix your merge conflict as soon as possible. Especially if you’re working on taxonomy changes. If your branch lingers for a while it can get outdated from develop pretty fast and that can cause some unexpected issues. Check your fix locally to make sure that it looks good there. Ask your PR approver to review your PR after you fix the merge conflict. Here are two options to resolve conflicts: When you see the conflicts in GitHub desktop, click the option to resolve these in VS Code. Use the GitHub website editor (click the Resolve conflict button) to fix these. What’s new related merge conflicts Merge conflicts pop up pretty often with what’s new posts because the whats-new-ids.json file that’s automatically updated when the site builds can get out-of-date pretty fast. If you see changes to this file show up in GitHub Desktop, make sure to discard them, rather than push them up to your branch. This will make it less likely that other people will have to deal with merge conflicts related to this file. Caution Never merge a PR that changes whats-new-ids.json.",

Resources VSCode (or another text editor) VSCode has great GitHub integrations GitHub account GitHub Desktop Edit in the GitHub web editor vs local build Need to edit a doc? Use this table to decide where to work! Use the GitHub web editor for: Use the local build for: Adding content to one doc: Rewriting sentences, or 1-2 lines Editing small amounts of content: updating URLs, deleting typos, etc. Brand new docs Rewrites of more than 1 or 2 lines Any updates to doc frontmatter Title changes Taxonomy changes Metadescription updates Redirects Updating images Editing multiple docs at once Continue reading for instructions on how to edit a doc locally. 1. Set up your local environment Running the site locally makes testing and previewing large changes much easier. Here's how to get setup: Install GitHub Desktop Sign in to GitHub Desktop. On Macs, click on GitHub Desktop in the top left corner of your screen and select Preferences. Select the blue Sign In button and follow the prompts in the browser window. Navigate to the Docs Site repository on GitHub.com. Click the green Code button and then select Open with GitHub Desktop. Choose the location where you want the repo, and this will clone the entire repository to your local machine at the designated path. You can ensure the repo was cloned by navigating to your local GitHub folder (the default is ~/Documents/github). Once you have cloned the repo, you don't need to clone it again in the future. 2. Run the site locally Build the site locally using the terminal to preview changes before opening a Pull Request. While it's highly recommended to build the site locally, this is technically an optional step. The site will automatically reflect any local changes once build. Node and Yarn are tools used to build the site on your local machine. Prerequisites Install Node Install Yarn npm install -g yarn Build the site In your terminal, go to your cloned repo, docs-website. For example: cd ~/Documents/github/docs-website Run yarn with the following commands: yarn && yarn start The site will take a few minutes to build. Make yourself some tea or coffee. Once it's built, you can access your preview site in your browser by navigating to http://localhost:8000/ 3. Edit a doc Once your local environment and branch are set up, you're ready to edit a doc. Check out the style guide for writing guidelines. First, ensure your Current Branch in GitHub Desktop is set to the correct branch, not Develop. Navigate to the doc you want to edit in Finder. If I wanted to edit a Python agent doc, I would navigate to: ~/Documents/github/docs-website/src/content/docs/agents/python-agent/hosting-services/python-agent-stackato.mdx Edit the doc in your text editor of choice. You should write docs in markdown language. Reference the style guide for help with formatting markdown Save the file with your edits, then follow the same process for any other docs you wish to edit. 4. Commit your changes Once your edits are done, you can commit them. This stages your changes, which you will later push upstream to Github. By pushing your changes, everyone will have access to your branch and commits. Navigate to GitHub Desktop. The left column should have a record of all the edits you have made to docs. In the bottom left corner, name your commit and add a good description of your edits. It should be descriptive enough to ensure that someone can understand all the changes made by simply scanning this description. Click Commit to [yourbranchname] 5. Publish your commits Once you have committed your changes, you're almost ready to open your Pull Request. First, you need to ensure your branch is pushed upstream. On GitHub desktop, click the blue Publish Branch button if available. If you don't see the Publish Branch, click the blue Push Origin button. This will push all your commits upstream and make them available to everyone else through the GitHub repository. 6. Open your pull request Now that your commits are available to everyone, you need to notify people that your changes are ready to be merged into the develop branch. To do this, you open a pull request: On GitHub Desktop, click the blue Create Pull Request button. This will open GitHub in your browser, and prompt you to fill in your pull request. Ensure you're merging from your branch into either the main or develop branch. If you scroll down, you can review all your commits to ensure they reflect all your changes. Just like your commit description, your pull request description should be detailed and give the full context of your changes. Feel free to add any additional context here (GitHub issue link or Jira issue ID, SMEs, etc.) To request a review from another Tech Writer: in GitHub open the PR, navigate to the Conversation section, and then select or type in a reviewer name in the Reviewer section. Add any relevant labels to your PR. If you do not add from_tw, the PR will not be automatically assigned to another writer for review. Once you're satisfied with your pull request, click the green Create pull request button. You can either publish the changes directly by approving the pull request yourself, or you can request for another Tech Writer to peer edit it. At the bottom of the pull request page, you will see a Checks section. These checks ensure your PR doesn't break the build process of the site. Ensure all checks marked required pass before merging. Once the pull request has passed the checks and it has been approved by another tech writer (or you are confident the changes are ready to be published), click the green Merge pull request button. This will merge your branch and commits into the repository and will begin the build process. If you don't add the from_tw label when you first create a PR, it will not automatically assign a reviewer. If you forget to add the label before opening the PR: Add the from_tw label. Turn the PR into a draft PR. Select the PR is ready for review button at the bottom of the page to reopen the PR. The PR should now have a reviewer. Preview a doc There are two main ways to preview branches you’ve already published and run commits on: Local: Quicker, but requires a semi-substantial amount of setup and familiarity with a terminal. Gatsby Cloud: Full preview of the live site with no overhead, and a very convenient way to share a preview of your draft with a SME. Gatsby Cloud will comment on your PR with a link to a preview version of the site once the build is ready. Building the site generally takes about 15 minutes, but can sometimes take longer if there are a lot of changes. Revise and publish a doc If you’re notified that a reviewer has submitted a review to your file, go to your PR and review the changes. You might see them in the diff view, if they’re part of a review with comments; otherwise, they might appear as copy edits in the file. Respond to any comments in the file. Either reply with follow up discussion, or click Resolve conversation. When you’ve resolved all the comments, and all of the automatic checks have passed, you can merge the pull request. Merging the pull request sets in motion the automated build process and your changes will be published shortly. Note: You will only be able to merge when the Merge pull request button is green. If it’s not green, review for any comments you missed, or other messages that indicate why GitHub is blocking you from merging. Revert merging Remember that you can almost always undo things. If you merge a PR, and then find that you shouldn’t have, you can unmerge with the Revert button. On the Pull requests tab in GitHub, click Closed on the tally bar to see all the issues and PRs that have alredy been merged. Locate the PR you merged, and locate the Revert button. Click Revert. That creates a new PR, which needs to be merged. If you want to reopen it, you need to follow the link back to the original PR and either revert that or reopen it. Writers only: Work on a branch, not a fork Some teams work on branches, some teams work on forks; the Docs team works in branches. As long as a branch has been pushed upstream, this allows us to work collaboratively and ensure that no work is ever lost when someone goes on vacation. To create a branch on the docs-website repo: Open GitHub Desktop Click on Current branch: xxx Click on New Branch You will be prompted to name your new branch. Descriptive names are best. It's a great way to quickly clue people in to what your work is all about. For example, if you are working on What’s New pages, you might name the branch Whats-new-updates. When you create a new branch, don't forget to add the Jira ticket's key (DOC-1234) to the branch name and the PR title.",

      "body": "As tech doc writers (TW) we edit docs, do peer edits, or use the Docs Team GitHub board to track the status of issues and pull requests (PR). Who is who in an issue/PR? GitHub keeps track of all activity concerning an issue or PR, including, of course, the people involved. When a new issue or PR is filed, check on the filer’s username and see if they're listed as a member of the New Relic organization. If they aren't, try to find them on Slack based on their username. If you're not sure about someone's affiliation, treat them as external until you know otherwise. People in an issue/PR include: Creator: The person who opened the issue or PR. This could be a writer, a Relic, or an external user. We'll label the issue or PR differently depending on who created it. If you're not sure if a user is a Relic, a good trick is to click on their profile and see if they're a member of the New Relic GitHub org. Assignee: The person taking responsibility for a PR or issue. This will usually be used by the Hero or Sidekick to assign non-TW PRs and issues to themselves. It can also be used to take a TW’s PR or issue over from them. Reviewer: The person who reviews or peer edits the code/document and approves the changes. Not necessarily the person responsible for that area or responsible for merging the commit. You can pre-assign up to 100 reviewers to a given issue. Track issues in the board The docs board has the following columns: Column Description Needs triage The Hero or Sidekick review and label issues and PRs in this column, then drag them to the appropriate column. If a PR or issue is labeled eng, the Hero/Sidekick can go ahead and click its ellipses icon to archive it. Hero: to do PRs that the Hero needs to review, publish, and follow up with SMEs as needed. Hero: Assign yourself as Assignee. In review (Hero or any TW) Drag PRs to this column when they are being reviewed. This shows who is reviewing and what is being reviewed, so two writers don’t mistakenly work on the same PR. Any TW: Writer needs PR review PRs from Tech Docs team members that need a light edit pass to make sure everything in GitHub is correct. This should be checked by other writers every few hours so PRs don’t get stale. If you have a PR that’s been lingering here too long, ask for a reviewer in #doc_sprint_talk. Whoever takes it: assign yourself as Reviewer. Any TW: needs peer edit Like our Needs Peer Edit column in Jira: A writer has requested a review of their PR. Review their PR in GitHub and leave comments. Whoever takes it: assign yourself as Reviewer. Waiting on SME/Blocked For PRs that are blocked by need for SME info or confirmation (for example, as Hero you are waiting on an answer from the person who sent in a Hero pull request). Waiting on TW to merge All reviews are complete. The TW who created the PR (or who is assigned the issue) needs to merge this work into develop. Drafts A draft is a way to open a PR while indicating that the work is still in progress and not necessarily ready to merge immediately. You can't merge a Draft PR directly. Instead, you must move it out of draft status first. When you see a draft PR (especially from outside the team!), treat it as though it's a working draft, and reach out to the creator to discuss. Read more on GitHub's drafts. As a Hero, make sure you attend to the following throughout your day: Check in with the previous Hero at the start of your day (especially on Monday at the start of the week). Don’t forget to sync with the BCN Hero if necessary. Watch for incoming PRs in #docs_deploys, and review everything in the Needs triage column. Drag cards from that column to the appropriate column. Work through the cards in the Hero: to do column. Everyone on the team helps keep things moving: All writers should keep an eye on both Any TW columns. There's one column for PRs that need a simpler review before merging (typo fixes, drive-by edits, etc), and another column for PRs that need a peer edit. There are also two blocked columns: One for PRs blocked on a SME, and another column where we're waiting on the TW who created the PR to review feedback and/or merge. After merging, remove your ticket from the board. Deal with references in GitHub (and the style guide) Don't link to anything non-public from a public place. You can reference Jira tickets, but reference tickets by issue key (DOC-1234 is ok) rather than a link (https://newrelic.atlassian.net/browse/DOC-1234 is not). Don't mention traffic or usage numbers publicly. Don't reference internal people by name. If they have a GH account, @mention their GH handle. If they don't, talk instead about teams (\"talk to a browser team engineer\" or \"Support Engineer\") rather than people. You can mention the #documentation channel and hero. Merge releases into main work (or, when do we publish?) The Hero currently merges three times a day: At 9 AM (morning), 12 PM (noon), and 3 PM (evening) Pacific. We merge release branches into main to avoid interuptions when someone merges into develop during a release. To learn more about this workflow, see the gitflow documentation in Atlassian. To start a release: Create a branch based off develop Github Desktop by clicking Current Branch in the top header, clicking New Branch in the dropdown, and then selecting Develop. Name the branch following this pattern: daily-release/mm-dd-yy-morning/noon/evening. Here's an example: daily-release/10-27-21-morning. Push your changes by clicking Push Origin in GitHub Desktop. Create a pull request into main from your new daily release branch by clicking Create Pull Request. This will open a pull request screen on github.com. Pull requests default to merging into develop, so select main as the base branch in the left side of the page and then click Submit Pull Request. Wait until all the checks complete, and then merge the pull request. All branches that follow the daily-release/mm-dd-yy-morning pattern are protected branches. This means the branches can't be deleted or pushed to by non-admins. GitHub labels Every issue needs labels to help us triage and track the health of our backlog: content: Always add, this indicates the issue is content-related rather than a design or engineering issue. pg_*: Always add to indicate the product group. For full definitions, see the \"Doc Jira and GitHub fields\" doc in the internal team Google Drive. Indicate who created the issue: from_internal: A Relic created it. from_external: A user opened it in the repo OR it came in through #customer-feedback process. from_tw: One of us created it (unless we were passing along #customer-feedback). Optionally: docs-issues-migrate: Issues that are too large in scope for the docs team to handle without product team expertise. This label alerts the docs issues team to migrate these issues into the customer feedback channel where they will be triaged and sent to product teams. Jira’d: Issues that have a corresponding Jira ticket. Make sure you leave the Jira number in the comments of the issue (for example, DOC-1234). Every pull request needs these labels so we can see where our contributions come from: content: Always add, this indicates the PR is content-related rather than design or engineering. Indicate who created the pull request: from_internal: A Relic created it. from_external: A user opened it in the repo OR it came in through #customer-feedback process. from_tw: One of us created it (unless we were passing along #customer-feedback). If the PR fixes an external issue, label it as from_tw since the work was done by a tech writer. Check the edit history of a doc or file Use any of these options to check or \"diff\" the history of a file. Option 1: GitHub history tab Navigate to the doc on the doc site and click Edit page in the right nav. Click History in the top right corner of the doc. Option 2: githistory.xy Navigate to your specific file on GitHub.com: https://github.com/newrelic/docs-website/blob/develop/src/content/docs/browser/new-relic-browser/browser-agent-spa-api/add-page-action.mdx Copy In the url, replace github.com with github.githistory.xyz: https://github.githistory.xyz/newrelic/docs-website/blob/develop/src/content/docs/browser/new-relic-browser/browser-agent-spa-api/add-page-action.mdx Copy It will take you to a site which presents the visual history of that specific file. You can view changes by clicking through the commit history at the top of your page. Option 3: Git blame Follow GitHub's documentation. Alternatively, you can use the following command in your terminal: git log --follow \"**/file_name_here.mdx\" Copy This will output the commit history of that file. By default, it only shows the first few commits. You can scroll by pressing Return multiple times. For example, to find the commit history for vmware-vsphere-monitoring-integration.mdx, I would run: git log --follow \"**/vmware-vsphere-monitoring-integration.mdx\" Copy Docs site history before October 2021 We had a large site restructure in October 2021 which lost most of the file history for our docs. You can find an archived version of our site pre-rework in the pre-IA-2021 branch. By navigating the pre-rework version of our repo, you can find file history and more.",

      "body": "All of our sprint work is tracked in Jira. The workflow depends on what type of work we're dealing with: Planned or unplanned (\"surprise!\") work. Planned work Planned work includes all work that is currently in our backlog or has been added to the current sprint as a result of a Sprint Planning session. This could include writing or updating documentation, research, meeting with SMEs, information architecture, incorporating peer edits, SME review, and so on. Unplanned work (surprises!) Usually, we get notified of major requests far enough in advance that we can include them in liaison project plans, backlog grooming, and sprint planning. Occasionally, something bigger surprises us that needs emergency support. Follow this process with new docs asks to assess the scope of work and ensure we address valid docs needs within a reasonable amount of time. Our goal is to treat the sprint as sacred and insulate against \"surprise\" work that is not absolutely crucial. But we also want to ensure we're providing good internal customer service, and not getting hung up on process niceties for things that are small. Jira boards: Backlog and future sprints This is where the vast majority of tickets spend their time. Most tickets (even for active projects) spend at least a little time here before moving into a sprint to be actively worked. Being in the backlog doesn't mean something isn't important---just that we haven't committed to it yet.  You can also add tickets straight to a future sprint. This is where tickets tentatively assigned to a future sprint will be found. Tickets can be assigned here to be held for backlog grooming and sprint planning.  Jira boards: Current sprint Proposed This step is for work that has been assigned to the current sprint during Sprint Planning and is available to be picked up by a tech writer. When you're ready to take on a new ticket, try to work the queue from the top-down and avoid cherry picking. It's also better to pick up Needs Peer Edit tickets before committing to a new ticket. Something that needs a peer edit is close to done, and helping things across the finish line helps get value into users hands, and frees us up to think about new problems. In Progress This step is for all of the work to be done by the assignee: Research, meeting with SMEs, information architecture, writing, incorporating peer edits, SME review, and so on. Tickets are moved to this step once work is started by the TW, and remain here until the work is either complete, ready for peer review, or it becomes blocked. If additional large edits are needed after the peer review, the ticket can be moved back to In Progress for those edits. Needs Peer Editor Work that is ready for a peer edit. Once a peer editor picks it up, they move it into In Peer Edit. In Peer Edit This step is for a peer editor to review docs before they go live. Follow the Peer editor workflow, then move the ticket into Peer Edit Done.  Peer Edit Done This step is a holding state once peer editing is complete. After completing their peer edit and delivering their feedback, the peer editor moves the ticket into Peer Edit Done. From there, the assignee on the ticket (not the peer editor) moves the ticket into the appropriate column (In Progress, Blocked, or Closed). Minor edits can be completed from this column but for major doc rework, the ticket should be moved back into the In Progress column. Blocked This step is for tickets that cannot be moved forward by the team. This could be because we're waiting for a response from a SME, or for a feature to deploy, or for final signoff. The team keeps an eye on this column for tickets that may need escalation. Putting something in Blocked rather than In Progress lets us see the status of every ticket at a glance. This column can also be used for extended time out of the office for the assigned writer, if it's work that can be safely held. (If the work cannot be held while you're out, find another writer to step in and take over.) Once you're un-blocked, move the ticket to the appropriate column. If the ticket remains blocked at the end of the current sprint, it will need to be re-reviewed during backlog grooming to determine if the ticket will carry-over into the upcoming sprint, or return to the backlog until a future sprint. Done This step is for work that is 100% finished. Work gets cleared out this column before we start a new sprint. Incomplete (\"carry-over\") tickets Ticket don't carry over automatically between sprints. Instead, any ticket that gets carried over is treated as a \"new\" ticket in the next sprint planning. Before sprint planning, review any open tickets in the board that are assigned to you and figure out what to do with them. For each open ticket assigned to you (or \"carry over\"), decide if you should: Recommended: Clone the ticket and close the old one. This is the best option for partially completed work because it makes metrics easier. If you do: Clone the ticket. Note why we closed the ticket. Add an estimate of points completed in the Points Completed field. Create a follow-up ticket if necessary. Move the ticket to the next sprint. If you do: Review the ticket's action items and description to make sure they're still current. Clear out the ticket points. Move the ticket back to the backlog. If you do: Update the action items and description to make sure they're still current.

      "body": "As tech doc writers (TW) we edit docs, do peer edits, or use the Docs Team GitHub board to track the status of issues and pull requests (PR). Who is who in an issue/PR? GitHub keeps track of all activity concerning an issue or PR, including, of course, the people involved. When a new issue or PR is filed, check on the filer’s username and see if they're listed as a member of the New Relic organization. If they aren't, try to find them on Slack based on their username. If you're not sure about someone's affiliation, treat them as external until you know otherwise. People in an issue/PR include: Creator: The person who opened the issue or PR. This could be a writer, a Relic, or an external user. We'll label the issue or PR differently depending on who created it. If you're not sure if a user is a Relic, a good trick is to click on their profile and see if they're a member of the New Relic GitHub org. Assignee: The person taking responsibility for a PR or issue. This will usually be used by the Hero or Sidekick to assign non-TW PRs and issues to themselves. It can also be used to take a TW’s PR or issue over from them. Reviewer: The person who reviews or peer edits the code/document and approves the changes. Not necessarily the person responsible for that area or responsible for merging the commit. You can pre-assign up to 100 reviewers to a given issue. Track issues in the board The docs board has the following columns: Column Description Needs triage The Hero or Sidekick review and label issues and PRs in this column, then drag them to the appropriate column. If a PR or issue is labeled eng, the Hero/Sidekick can go ahead and click its ellipses icon to archive it. Hero: to do PRs that the Hero needs to review, publish, and follow up with SMEs as needed. Hero: Assign yourself as Assignee. In review (Hero or any TW) Drag PRs to this column when they are being reviewed. This shows who is reviewing and what is being reviewed, so two writers don’t mistakenly work on the same PR. Any TW: Writer needs PR review PRs from Tech Docs team members that need a light edit pass to make sure everything in GitHub is correct. This should be checked by other writers every few hours so PRs don’t get stale. If you have a PR that’s been lingering here too long, ask for a reviewer in #doc_sprint_talk. Whoever takes it: assign yourself as Reviewer. Any TW: needs peer edit Like our Needs Peer Edit column in Jira: A writer has requested a review of their PR. Review their PR in GitHub and leave comments. Whoever takes it: assign yourself as Reviewer. Waiting on SME/Blocked For PRs that are blocked by need for SME info or confirmation (for example, as Hero you are waiting on an answer from the person who sent in a Hero pull request). Waiting on TW to merge All reviews are complete. The TW who created the PR (or who is assigned the issue) needs to merge this work into develop. Drafts A draft is a way to open a PR while indicating that the work is still in progress and not necessarily ready to merge immediately. You can't merge a Draft PR directly. Instead, you must move it out of draft status first. When you see a draft PR (especially from outside the team!), treat it as though it's a working draft, and reach out to the creator to discuss. Read more on GitHub's drafts. As a Hero, make sure you attend to the following throughout your day: Check in with the previous Hero at the start of your day (especially on Monday at the start of the week). Don’t forget to sync with the BCN Hero if necessary. Watch for incoming PRs in #docs_deploys, and review everything in the Needs triage column. Drag cards from that column to the appropriate column. Work through the cards in the Hero: to do column. Everyone on the team helps keep things moving: All writers should keep an eye on both Any TW columns. There's one column for PRs that need a simpler review before merging (typo fixes, drive-by edits, etc), and another column for PRs that need a peer edit. There are also two blocked columns: One for PRs blocked on a SME, and another column where we're waiting on the TW who created the PR to review feedback and/or merge. After merging, remove your ticket from the board. Deal with references in GitHub (and the style guide) Don't link to anything non-public from a public place. You can reference Jira tickets, but reference tickets by issue key (DOC-1234 is ok) rather than a link (https://newrelic.atlassian.net/browse/DOC-1234 is not). Don't mention traffic or usage numbers publicly. Don't reference internal people by name. If they have a GH account, @mention their GH handle. If they don't, talk instead about teams (\"talk to a browser team engineer\" or \"Support Engineer\") rather than people. You can mention the #documentation channel and hero. Merge releases into main work (or, when do we publish?) The Hero currently merges three times a day: At 9 AM (morning), 12 PM (noon), and 3 PM (evening) Pacific. We merge release branches into main to avoid interuptions when someone merges into develop during a release. To learn more about this workflow, see the gitflow documentation in Atlassian. To start a release: Create a branch based off develop Github Desktop by clicking Current Branch in the top header, clicking New Branch in the dropdown, and then selecting Develop. Name the branch following this pattern: daily-release/mm-dd-yy-morning/noon/evening. Here's an example: daily-release/10-27-21-morning. Push your changes by clicking Push Origin in GitHub Desktop. Create a pull request into main from your new daily release branch by clicking Create Pull Request. This will open a pull request screen on github.com. Pull requests default to merging into develop, so select main as the base branch in the left side of the page and then click Submit Pull Request. Wait until all the checks complete, and then merge the pull request. All branches that follow the daily-release/mm-dd-yy-morning pattern are protected branches. This means the branches can't be deleted or pushed to by non-admins. GitHub labels Every issue needs labels to help us triage and track the health of our backlog: content: Always add, this indicates the issue is content-related rather than a design or engineering issue. pg_*: Always add to indicate the product group. For full definitions, see the \"Doc Jira and GitHub fields\" doc in the internal team Google Drive. Indicate who created the issue: from_internal: A Relic created it. from_external: A user opened it in the repo OR it came in through #customer-feedback process. from_tw: One of us created it (unless we were passing along #customer-feedback). Optionally: docs-issues-migrate: Issues that are too large in scope for the docs team to handle without product team expertise. This label alerts the docs issues team to migrate these issues into the customer feedback channel where they will be triaged and sent to product teams. Jira’d: Issues that have a corresponding Jira ticket. Make sure you leave the Jira number in the comments of the issue (for example, DOC-1234). Every pull request needs these labels so we can see where our contributions come from: content: Always add, this indicates the PR is content-related rather than design or engineering. Indicate who created the pull request: from_internal: A Relic created it. from_external: A user opened it in the repo OR it came in through #customer-feedback process. from_tw: One of us created it (unless we were passing along #customer-feedback). If the PR fixes an external issue, label it as from_tw since the work was done by a tech writer. Check the edit history of a doc or file Use any of these options to check or \"diff\" the history of a file. Option 1: GitHub history tab Navigate to the doc on the doc site and click Edit page in the right nav. Click History in the top right corner of the doc. Option 2: githistory.xy Navigate to your specific file on GitHub.com: https://github.com/newrelic/docs-website/blob/develop/src/content/docs/browser/new-relic-browser/browser-agent-spa-api/add-page-action.mdx Copy In the url, replace github.com with github.githistory.xyz: https://github.githistory.xyz/newrelic/docs-website/blob/develop/src/content/docs/browser/new-relic-browser/browser-agent-spa-api/add-page-action.mdx Copy It will take you to a site which presents the visual history of that specific file. You can view changes by clicking through the commit history at the top of your page. Option 3: Git blame Follow GitHub's documentation. Alternatively, you can use the following command in your terminal: git log --follow \"**/file_name_here.mdx\" Copy This will output the commit history of that file. By default, it only shows the first few commits. You can scroll by pressing Return multiple times. For example, to find the commit history for vmware-vsphere-monitoring-integration.mdx, I would run: git log --follow \"**/vmware-vsphere-monitoring-integration.mdx\" Copy Docs site history before October 2021 We had a large site restructure in October 2021 which lost most of the file history for our docs. You can find an archived version of our site pre-rework in the pre-IA-2021 branch. By navigating the pre-rework version of our repo, you can find file history and more.",

To troubleshoot GitHub issues, see our guide. Peer editing workflow in GitHub If you’re peer editing a doc or have been otherwise assigned to a PR as a reviewer, you have a few choices for how and where to do the work. The most streamlined and open-source approach is to do the edit using GitHub options, rather than copying the file to Google Docs and editing there. Developmental edit pass For cases where you have questions and suggestions rather than straight copy edits, follow these steps. Open the PR that you’re assigned to review. On the Files changed tab, you can either: Click Review changes and then select one of the following: Comment - use if you have a comment that doesn’t require follow up. Approve - use if you just want to approve the PR. You can request changes in the Leave a comment area, and select Approve if you want to let the writer make the edits and merge the file without a follow-up review from you. Request changes - use for times when you want to make sure the changes you request are included. You’ll be notified with any updates that the writer makes. OR, start making comments on lines or sections of the doc. To do this, click the add comment icon , and leave an edit or comment for that specific line in the page. With this option, you get the choice between adding a single comment or starting a review. If you’re going to make comments throughout a doc, choose Start a review so the comments will all be rolled into one commit. Click Finish your review to complete your review. This triggers a notification to the writer alerting them that you’ve made suggestions. Copy edit workflow If you have copy edits for a file rather than comments and suggestions, you can make the changes to the file in different ways. Here are two main options: Edit using the GitHub browser: On the Files changed tab, in the diff window click the editing button (three dots). When you finish your edits, add a comment at the bottom of the file and choose to either commit the changes directly, or create a branch and start a pull request. Choose to branch and start a pull request if you expect a writer to review the diff and accept or revise your edits. Edit locally: Check out the branch containing the file you want to edit. In GitHub Desktop, click the Current branch down arrow and select the branch. Then, make the edits on your local drive, save, and commit your changes to the branch. Note that this approach adds your edits to the open pull request. You can now see the changes you added to the file on the Files changed tab in the PR. These are just a few of many editing options. You’ll find your preferred way, just as with any other tool.",

You can view changes by clicking through the commit history at the top of your page. Option 3: Git blame Follow GitHub's documentation. Alternatively, you can use the following command in your terminal: git log --follow \"**/file_name_here.mdx\" Copy This will output the commit history of that file. By default, it only shows the first few commits. You can scroll by pressing Return multiple times. For example, to find the commit history for vmware-vsphere-monitoring-integration.mdx, I would run: git log --follow \"**/vmware-vsphere-monitoring-integration.mdx\" Copy Docs site history before October 2021 We had a large site restructure in October 2021 which lost most of the file history for our docs. You can find an archived version of our site pre-rework in the pre-IA-2021 branch. By navigating the pre-rework version of our repo, you can find file history and more.",

Ideally, one line or less on the \"View all methods\" page. Requirements Agent version 1.2.3.4 or higher. Additional requirements on their own line (do not use bullets). Do not use any callouts. If there are no special requirements, write: Compatible with all agent versions. Description Describe the behavior of the call with as much detail as possible. Do not describe what individual parameters do except in broad strokes; details of parameters and call variants belong under the Parameters heading. Similarly, do not describe return values. When cross-referencing another API call, format its name with code blocks, and include parentheses () like this: anotherCoolMethod(). Tip You can include callouts, but use discretion. These pages are already visually busy. Parameters If there are no parameters, leave this section blank. If there is only one call variant, do not include a syntax block in this section. Parameter Description newrelic.apiStyleGuidelines(data type $parameter_name[, integer $optional_param]) Copy $parameter_name data type Required. Brief description of parameter. $optional_param integer Optional. Brief description of parameter. newrelic.apiStyleGuidelines(data type $parameter_name, array $different_param) Copy $parameter_name data type Required. Brief description of parameter. $different_param array Required. Brief description of parameter. $third_param string Required. Brief description of parameter. Return values What does this call return, and in what circumstances? Are there any things we expect customers to do with that return value? If the call does not return anything, leave this section blank. Examples This section documents rules for oddballs that aren't self-documenting. The rest of the examples are embedded within the page itself. In general, this page is intended for style reference. For examples of how to write good API method pages, check out our existing API docs, such as the PHP API. URL guidelines For the doc's URL: Manually edit the URL slug to remove the agent name. Where the API call does not already include separators (as in newrelic_awesome_call), separate the bits with hyphens -. For example: https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/new-relic-only/advanced-style-guide/writing-guidelines/api-style-guidelines Copy Title guidelines For the doc's title: Include the method name and the agent name in parentheses. Do not include newrelic. prefixes unless they are integral to the call name (as in the PHP agent). Do not include parentheses () in the call itself. For example: apiStyleGuidelines (Example agent API) Copy Short title guidelines For the doc's short title: Include only the method name. Do not include newrelic. prefixes unless they are integral to the call name (as in the PHP agent). Do not include parentheses (). Adjust if necessary to fit on a single line in the category's sidebar. For example: apiStyleGuidelines Copy Syntax guidelines Important The Python and iOS agents use their own guidelines. For those guidelines, see the existing methods in those languages. Document each variant of a call on its own line. Do not use any formatting except italicizing the data type. Wrap optional parameters (including the comma separator) in square brackets []. Indicate the variable portion by prefacing it with a dollar sign $. If the call must be prefixed with newrelic. or similar, include that in the syntax. Optional: Include the return value, if that seems important for your particular agent. If you do, follow language conventions.",

      "body": "Use the Hosts page to better understand important performance metrics, like resource usage, network and processes performance, and data about your containers. You can filter your hosts by attributes and compare their performance with inventory change events to help determine root causes. You can also set alert notifications to help prevent problems. To view your hosts information, go to one.newrelic.com > Infrastructure > Hosts, then click any of the following tabs: System: Overview of your hosts' performance Network: Bandwidth and error data about your network interfaces Processes: Data about CPU percentage, I/O bytes, and memory usage for individual or groups of processes Storage: Resources' capacity and efficiency, including your devices' overall utilization, disk usage, or I/O operations Docker containers: CPU percentage, I/O bytes, and memory usage for individual or group of containers System tab Here are the default graphs shown on the Hosts page. For additional chart options, select the dropdown for any chart. CPU %: On the System tab, CPU Percent is a derived metric that is part of the SystemSample event. The CPU percentage is not collected by New Relic, but derived from several other metrics. Specifically, the cpuPercent attribute is an aggregation of cpuUserPercent, cpuSystemPercent, cpuIoWaitPercent and cpuStealPercent. Load average five minute: represents an average of the number of tasks waiting to do work on a system over the last 5 minutes. Memory free %: compares the amount of free memory bytes to the amount of used memory bytes. For explanations of different chart metrics, see Default infrastructure attributes and events. Functions for adjusting chart data include: Select different host groups: Use the host filter. Change time range: Use the time picker above the charts, or drag and select a time range on a chart. Change the number of elements on charts: use the Chart shows dropdown. Change data used to order hosts: Use the table below the charts to order the chart elements by different metrics; for example, from highest to lowest CPU user % to lowest, or from lowest to highest Disk free. System tab functions Here are some of the things you can do from the System tab: If you want to... Do this... Filter and group hosts Use filter sets to show only hosts matching certain criteria, or use group by to aggregate the results. Understand host health Use the Health column of the table. To see more details about specific violations, select the health status icons. Find root causes of issues Use the Events heatmap at the top of the page to compare performance to important events happening in your infrastructure. For more, see Events heatmap. Set an alert condition for a metric Mouse over a chart, select and then Create alert. View host's alert threshold violation If present, select the host's Critical icon or Warning icon. APM and infrastructure data If you have APM data associated with your infrastructure data, there are several ways to access your APM data on the Hosts page: Use the hosts filter to filter on hosts running specific applications. In the host list below the charts, select the Application column to filter on specific applications. From the chart selector dropdown beside a chart's name, select one of the application-related charts. Important APM charts in infrastructure monitoring do not have View query or Create alert options like the other infrastructure charts do. For more about using APM and infrastructure monitoring together, see APM data in infrastructure. Network tab The Network page provides real-time visibility into the health and performance of individual hosts, web servers, or other groups of resources across your network. Default charts show bandwidth metrics by packet, bandwidth by bytes, and errors per second. Details about individual interfaces can help you: Examine saturation levels across your network or for selected filter sets. Compare load balances between specific resources. Identify unexpected differences in capacity patterns between similar hosts. Evaluate the top five network errors that New Relic automatically presents for the selected time period. This real-time network data can then help you determine whether to resolve errors by reconfiguring your network, rebalancing the loads, or taking other preventative maintenance actions before needing to make a purchase decision. From the Network tab you can view bandwidth and error data about your network interfaces. The Network page includes an Events heatmap, which provides a snapshot of the events occurring within the same time range as the displayed metrics. For a technical explanation of the attributes used to populate the Network page chart, see NetworkSample attributes. Network tab functions Here are some of the things you can do from the Network tab: If you want to... Do this... Filter and group Use filter sets to show only hosts matching certain criteria, or use Group by to aggregate the results. Select a time range Use the time picker to change the range of time selected. You can also click and drag on the chart to select a custom time range. When you select a time range, it carries over when you go from one infrastructure page to another. Change metrics displayed in chart Use the sorting dropdown to switch what metric the chart is displaying for the chosen process groupings, including: Received Bytes Received Dropped Received Errors Received Packets Transmitted Bytes Transmitted Dropped Transmitted Errors Transmitted Packets Search and filter the list Type in the Search interfaces search bar to filter the list to only those items containing the text you've typed. You can also filter the list by simply selecting the list item or user name you want to filter for. The chosen filters are displayed beside the filter icon above the chart. Add items to chart The chart, by default, displays the top five results. Use the Chart shows dropdown to display more results. To remove an item from a chart, select its name below the chart. Set an alert condition for a metric Mouse over a chart, select and then Create alert. (Not available on APM charts.) View host's alert threshold violation Select the host's Critical icon or Warning icon. Processes tab Important By default, the infrastructure agent doesn't send data about the operating system's processes unless you use guided install. To enable the sending of process data set enable_process_metrics to true. To fine-tune which processes you want to monitor, configure include_matching_metrics. Use the Processes tab to get information about processes running on your hosts, and to set alerts on process metrics. The Processes tab shows data such as CPU percentage, I/O bytes, and memory usage for individual processes or groupings of processes. The page also includes an events heatmap, which provides a snapshot of the events occurring within the same time range as the displayed metrics. Use this information to: Pinpoint processes that are causing performance issues. Create alerts for conditions such as CPU percentage and memory usage. On the Processes page, CPU percent is scoped to individual processes, rather than hosts. Because of this, the CPU percent metric does not take into account the resources of the entire system. Instead, it shows how much of a single CPU core each process is taking. Example Here's an example of how to pinpoint an issue and set an alert: You notice on the Hosts page that a cluster has a CPU percentage much higher than normal. You go to the Processes page and filter down to that cluster's processes. You notice that several instances of the same process have excessive CPU percentage. After fixing the issue, you decide to create an alert condition that triggers when the CPU percentage for that process type exceeds a certain threshold. For a technical explanation of the attributes used to populate the Processes page chart, see ProcessSample attributes. Tip You cannot start, stop, or restart processes from the UI. Instead, follow standard procedures to start, stop, check, or restart the infrastructure agent manually. Processes tab functions Here are some of the things you can do from the Processes tab: If you want to... Do this... Only show hosts matching certain criteria Use filter sets. Aggregate results or group by host attributes Use Group by to change how the processes are grouped in the chart and the list. The dropdown contains host-related attributes such as hostID and entityName. If you are monitoring AWS EC2 instances, EC2-related attributes such as awsRegion will be available. Select a time range Use either of these options: Select any of the time picker options at the top of the page. Click and drag on the chart to select a custom time range. After you select a time range, it carries over from one infrastructure page to another. View Docker metrics To view process usage by Docker containers, see Docker instrumentation. Change charts Select the dropdown beside the chart's name to switch what metric the chart displays. Choices include: Memory: Resident or virtual size CPU percentage Disk I/O: Read or write Search and filter the list Use either of these options: Type in the Search processes search bar. Select the list item or user name you want to filter for. The selected filters appear beside the filter icon above the chart, where you can select and remove them as needed. Set an alert condition for a metric Mouse over a chart. Select and then Create alert. (Not available on APM charts.) View host's alert threshold violation Select the host's Critical icon or Warning icon. Storage tab The Storage page allows you to monitor your resources' capacity and efficiency, including your devices' overall utilization, disk usage, or I/O operations. This can help you to: Examine unexpected patterns; for example, a cluster of mirrored machines that do not process I/O tasks uniformly. Monitor usage levels before disk space completely runs out. Set alert conditions to notify you about problems with one or more hosts; for example, long processing times for read or write operations, disk availability or utilization based on percentage or bytes, etc. Make informed decisions about where to redistribute hosts with higher or lower than normal processing requests. Use data to help plan for additions or changes to your infrastructure budget before an emergency arises. The Storage page includes an Events heatmap, which provides a snapshot of the events occurring within the same time range as the displayed metrics. For a technical explanation of the attributes used to populate the Storage page chart, see StorageSample attributes. Storage tab functions Here are some of the things you can do from the Storage tab: If you want to... Do this... Filter and group Use filter sets to show only hosts matching certain criteria, or use Group by to aggregate the results. Select a time range Use the time picker on the upper right to change the range of time selected. You can also click and drag on the chart to select a custom time range. When you select a time range, it carries over when you go from one infrastructure page to another. Change metrics displayed in chart Use the sorting dropdown to switch what metric the chart is displaying for the chosen process groupings. Choices include: Total Utilization % Read Utilization % Write Utilization % Disk Used Bytes Disk Free Bytes I/O Read Operations I/O Write Operations Search and filter the list Type in the Search devices search bar to filter the list. You can also filter the list by simply selecting the list item or user name you want to filter for. The chosen filters are displayed beside the filter icon above the chart. Add/remove chart items The chart, by default, displays the top five results. Use the Chart shows dropdown to display more results. To remove an item, select its name below the chart. Set an alert condition for a metric Mouse over a chart. Select and then Create alert. (Not available on APM charts.) View host's alert threshold violation Select the host's Critical icon or Warning icon. Docker containers tab Use the Docker containers tab to get information about the containers running on your hosts, and to set alerts on container metrics. The Docker containers tab shows data such as CPU percentage, I/O bytes, and memory usage for individual containers or groupings of containers. The page also includes an events heatmap, which provides a snapshot of the events occurring within the same time range as the displayed metrics. Use this information to: Identify containers that are experiencing performance issues. Create alerts for conditions such as CPU percentage and memory usage. Docker containers tab functions Here are some of the things you can do from the Docker containers tab: If you want to... Do this... Only show hosts matching certain criteria Use filter sets. Aggregate results or group by host attributes Use Group by to change how the processes are grouped in the chart and the list. The dropdown contains host-related attributes such as image and operatingSystem. Select a time range Use either of these options: Select any of the time picker options at the top of the page. Click and drag on the chart to select a custom time range. After you select a time range, it carries over from one infrastructure page to another. View Docker integration dashboard To open the Docker integration dashboard, click the Dashboard link above the data table. Change charts Select the dropdown beside the chart's name to switch what metric the chart displays. Choices include: CPU: Used cores, kernel percentage Memory: Size limit, cache bytes I/O: Write count per second, total bytes Network: Errors per second, packets Process: Process count, restart count Search and filter the list Use either of these options: Type in the Search processes search bar. Select the list item or user name you want to filter for. The selected filters appear beside the filter icon above the chart, where you can select and remove them as needed. Set an alert condition for a metric Mouse over a chart. Select and then Create alert. View host's alert threshold violation Select the host's Critical icon or Warning icon.",

      "body": "These are some organization basics. Organize your page to make it easier to read Consider these organization guidelines when thinking about the order of information in a doc. By following these guidelines, you'll make it easier for readers to skim and find what they need. How to organize information Comments Separate what and why from how. Define any necessary prerequisites, policies, or background information (the what and the why) before you step through the how (step-by-step procedures). Examples: Explain what the feature is and why it matters before telling readers how to use it. Describe any limitations with user permissions or subscription levels that would prevent them from using the feature. If the feature is available for any user or subscription level, don't bother to say so. Provide a roadmap for what users will be able to accomplish, so they know before starting a procedure that they have everything they need. Front-load directions with context. Make sure readers know where they need to be, before telling them what to do. In general, use (select an app) to describe what users select from the product index. Examples: Go to one.newrelic.com > Explorer > (select an app or service). Select (account dropdown) > User preferences. On the command line, type gitk. Also, structure steps by front-loading context from the user's point of view. For example, instead of \"Go to x to do y,\" structure the step as \"To do y, go to x.\" Separate requirements from options. Example: Type the Email you use to sign in and to receive information from New Relic. Optional: Type additional user emails, separated by commas. Follow the \"five to nine\" guideline. Depending on the topic, organize the information so there is a maximum of five to nine chunks of information. For example, readers may start to get lost or overwhelmed after about five h2 sections or seven steps into a procedure. If you have more than nine h2 sections or steps, you might need to create an additional doc or procedure. Other organization tools to consider: Levels of headings Lists Collapsers Callouts Tables Code examples For more help section Use action-oriented titles Wherever possible, give your document or h2 heading a task- or action-oriented title. Focus on what users are trying to accomplish or the problem they're trying to solve. Use present-tense verbs, rather than \"-ing\" verbs. Quality Title example Bad The query history Okay View query history Good Query history: Create and edit NRQL queries Start the document with an introductory paragraph Unless the document is less than a single screen in length, begin with a brief paragraph that introduces the topic or summarizes the important points. Not sure where to start? Try writing all the content for your document first, and then add the introduction to the top to summarize your key points. Or use the introduction to expand on the text in your metaDescription in the metadata. Keep documents short The amount of content needed can help you decide whether you need one or more documents for the topic. If all of the document's contents apply directly to the title, then everything belongs in the same document. If several related sections could be logically split into individual documents, and the overall length of your document is more than about two screenfuls, split those sections into other documents. Be sure to include links to the related contents. If a large document needs to be broken into multiple smaller documents, consider whether they might be best grouped together in their own sub-category. Use the New Relic voice We strive for a voice that's approachable, expert, and visionary. Check out our voice guidelines for how to write content with these qualities. And keep in mind these essential writing tips that apply to any type of documentation. Guidelines Comments Be clear and direct. Remember to: Use present tense. Use active voice; avoid passive voice. Tell users what to do, not what they \"should\" do. If absolutely necessary, tell users what not to do in situations where unexpected results may occur. Whenever possible, provide an alternative suggestion when telling users what not to do. Example: Using active voice with an alternative suggestion for what not to do Do not use your config file to change this setting, because this could affect other processes.

      "body": "Callouts direct your attention to information of special importance or to information that doesn't fit smoothly into the main text. Consider your reader. If your doc has too many callouts, it might confuse your reader about what matters the most and distract them from what does. Use your callouts judiciously. Recommendation: Skim the complete doc. If there are too many callouts, decide which ones can be removed. Types of callouts We have a number of callout types, and each is controlled by the variant you include in the <Callout> tag. Here's an example of the format for a tip callout: <Callout variant=\"tip\"> Your tip text goes here. It can have multiple paragraphs. </Callout> Copy Here are examples of our callout variants: Caution Cautions scream at you that this could cause a crash or cost you data loss beyond the task at hand. Cautions use <Callout variant=\"caution\">. At a traffic light, a Caution would be red. Caution Avoid disabling auto-transaction naming, because metric grouping issues will likely occur. Instead, use API calls to name your transactions. Important Important notes urge awareness that this could impair the task at hand or cost you time if you ignore the text. Important notes use <Callout variant=\"important\">. At a traffic light, an Important note would be yellow. Important Custom events sent via the agent API are not compatible with high security mode. Tip Tips whisper to you that this is nice to know, like a shortcut, best practice, or reminder, but is unnecessary to complete the task at hand. Tips use <Callout variant=\"tip\">. At a traffic light, a Tip would be a green light. User-related permissions For recommended wording, see User-related language and styles. Custom callouts Custom callouts are available for special cases, such as beta docs. Here's what you can control with custom callouts: Title text: Change the callout label by inserting the title attribute like this: title=\"YOUR CUSTOM TITLE\". When you publish, this field is automatically converted to all capital letters. Color: The color is limited to the color of the variant you include, or if you don't include a variant, you get the default border color (blue-grey). Here is what the code looks like: <Callout variant=\"caution\" title=\"YOUR CUSTOM TITLE\"> Your callout message goes here! </Callout> Copy For beta docs, add a custom callout. Also, we recommend that you don't include a variant so you display the default color: Beta feature This feature is still in development, but we encourage you to try it out! Avoid callout fatigue Callout fatigue is what happens when there are too many callouts on a doc. A single callout is a great way to draw attention to important information, but the more callouts there are, the more likely it is that your reader won't read the callouts. Keep these things in mind when you're working with callouts: If you add a callout, remove a callout. Wherever possible, don't increase the number of callouts. Do not use stacked callouts. Stacked callouts are two or more callouts that follow directly one after another. Not only do not use these, but if you see this in a doc, take a few minutes to break these callouts up. Remove outdated callouts. As you're going through the docs site, if you see a callout that's outdated, for whatever reason, take a few minutes to delete it from the doc. Be stingy in your use of important and warning callouts. If we use important and warning callouts too often, they lose their effectiveness. Stacked callouts example Here's an example of the stacked callouts we'd love to avoid. Tip The more callouts there are, the more difficult it is to spot the information that's important. Important Not everything is important enough to put in a callout. Caution Think carefully before adding another callout on the page.",

      "body": "For consistency across New Relic content, here are our general word usage guidelines: We generally follow the Microsoft Style Guide, which is based on the Chicago Manual of Style. We follow American English conventions, rather than British English ones. We defer to the official product names for references to products. (For example, for Amazon Web Services (AWS), see aws.amazon.com/products.) For terminology specific to New Relic, we use the product glossary. account ID A unique number that identifies a particular New Relic account. Don't use account number. agent Don't capitalize. Install the Ruby agent, not Install the Ruby Agent. Don't refer to a Synthetics private minion as an agent. am and pm Use the 12-hour clock followed by the (lowercased) time period am or pm. Don’t put a space after the last number in a timestamp (12:00am, not 12:00 am). Don't include a leading 0 when the hour is less than 10. 9:30am, 12:30pm, 8:30pm Copy Amazon Web Services (AWS) product names Refer to the specific product, not just AWS broadly. As a courtesy to your readers, on first mention always refer to Amazon products by their full names; for example Amazon Web Services (AWS). You can use the acronym after that, if there is one. Example: Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud. After that, use the short name according to the AWS Documentation site. Example: Amazon EC2. app name vs. app alias The \"machine name\" that the collector uses to uniquely identify an app is its app name. The server-side configuration setting that changes the visible \"name\" of an app without changing its unique identifier is its app alias. beta Use the beta callout. In the body text, use lowercase. For example: BETA FEATURE This feature is currently in beta. If the developer team prefers to use a term other than beta or private beta, clarify what is driving that use of the term (Legal requirement?), and add any relevant info here in the usage dictionary. bits and bytes Use standard prefixes and capitalization for International System of Units (SI), International Organization for Standardization (ISO), or Joint Electron Device Engineering Council (JEDEC memory) values when referring to multiples of bits (b) and bytes (B). 1 byte = 8 bits. Decimal value SI prefix Binary value ISO prefix JEDEC prefix 1000 k: kilo 1024 Ki: kibi K: kilo 1000^2 M: mega 1024^2 Mi: mebi M: mega 1000^3 G: giga 1024^3 Gi: gibi G: giga 1000^4 T: tera 1024^4 Ti: tebi - -- 1000^5 P: peta 1024^5 Pi: pebi - -- Tip For help with converting byte values (such as bytes to kilobytes), try this byte converter. blacklist and whitelist Don't use. Instead, use deny list and allow list; for example, \"Add a hostname to your deny list.\" capitalization This is more complex than can be covered in this usage dictionary. For detailed information, see: Heading capitalization Capitalization of features and UI elements Child account A parent account contains one or more child accounts. Child accounts were previously referred to as \"sub-accounts\". click In general, use click rather than the vaguer select. For example, you might click something in the UI, but then select something from a list. Be particularly careful to use click to describe actions that only make sense with a mouse; for example, with a right click or a click and drag. Also use click when the user must click on a non-selectable object (to save your changes, click anywhere outside the dialog box). See also [mouse over] #mouse-over). collector vs. connect to New Relic When referring to an agent talking to the New Relic servers, describe this as the New Relic collector. Although internally the collector refers only to specific parts of our architecture, we use it more broadly in our documentation to mean \"any endpoint a customer must connect to report data, for any product.\" Avoid \"connect to New Relic,\" and do not use \"connect to the New Relic UI.\" contractions When it makes sense for clarity, conciseness, and tone and voice, use contractions. Use them where they make the writing sound more like natural speech, and where they improve clarity and accessibility without sacrificing expertise and authority. There are no hard and fast rules for which contractions are or aren't acceptable, but simple and common is preferable to complicated and rare. For example, it's for it is is fine, but less common constructions like mustn't or wouldn't've are best avoided. Also: When using a negative contraction (don't, can't, won't) try to provide some additional info about what what to do and what can be done. (See the style guide intro for more on this.) There are places in our docs—for example, in notes and warnings—where spelling out do not, cannot, or will not is preferable to contractions to emphasize the action or blockage to be avoided. customer vs. user When possible, use the second person you to form a sense of connection with the reader. For times when you need a descriptive third-person noun, keep the following guidelines in mind: customer and user are both appropriate depending on context. customer makes more sense when talking about billing, or about a group of people or a business entity. For example, one customer may have one or more individual users who interact with New Relic through the customer's account(s). user makes more sense as a general term for an individual user, or when talking about users as an object in the account model. For example, when discussing account models, it's important to be specific about what constitutes a single person identity in our system. dashboard Don't use. Instead, use page. doc, document, documentation, docs site If you need to refer to the docs themselves—don't. Generally it's better to directly link to the doc you're referencing and use the doc title as your link text. For example, See [Install the .NET agent](URL) rather than See our [.NET agent install docs](URL). If there's not a good alternative, doc generally sounds more natural than document or documentation. If you're tempted to use a longer form, try reading it aloud to see which reads best. If you must refer to the site as a whole, call it the docs site rather than Docs site or documentation site. Internally, you can also refer to the whole URL docs.newrelic.com to avoid ambiguity with other sources of docs like internal platform docs or API explorer docs. To refer to our docs GitHub repo, use the repo name docs-website or the repo path newrelic/docs-website. dropdown Use dropdown instead of drop-down or drop down. Although it isn't common usage, you can use dropdown independently as a noun, without needing to say dropdown menu or dropdown list. For example, select a date from the <b>date</b> dropdown. e.g. and i.e. Avoid these Latin abbreviations. Instead of e.g., use for example or such as. Subbing for i.e. is tricker, because sometimes people use it to mean that is, while at other times it's mis-used to mean for example. Read the context to be clear, but usually the best solution is to rewrite so the description is clear without needing explanatory text. em dash (—) Em dashes are rarely needed in tech docs, sadly. You can usually accomplish what you need to by breaking the thought into multiple sentences or using parentheses. In some rare cases, though, an em dash can add drama and spice. If you think you've found such a case, make sure you use them right. An em dash should always use the real em dash character (not a hyphen), and no space before and after. For example: You can sign up for New Relic fast and free—we won't even ask for a credit card number. Copy You can insert an em dash with the COMMAND+OPTION+- shortcut or use the HTML entity. etc. Unlike the Latin abbreviations e.g. or i.e.), you're welcome to use etc. It should have a period at the end (etc.). Ensure that you have several meaningful examples, though, before using it. For example, cities including Portland, Seattle, Dublin, etc. but not cities including Portland, etc.. hostname This is one word. Don't hyphenate. icons When using an inline icon from the UI, always describe it first, then embed the icon image, and then end with the word icon. For example, select the delete icon. Don't put icons in bold. When writing about icons, describe the icon for its purpose or action, not what the icon looks like. For example: Yes: Select the edit icon. No: Select the pencil icon. For technical information on embedding images, see Inserting inline images and Embedding Font Awesome icons. index A list of entities, such as the APM applications index, the Synthetics Monitors index, or the Alerts Incidents index. See also page. infrastructure Don't use, unless referring to the New Relic Infrastructure product. Instead, use an appropriate substitute such as architecture, environment, system, host, etc. introduction Always use Introduction to for overview docs for a particular product. For example, Introduction to New Relic Infrastructure or Introduction to the PHP agent or Introduction to transaction traces. Don't use welcome to, basics, intro, overview, etc. Also avoid the Thing: Tagline format, as in X-Ray sessions: Traces and thread profiles for key transactions, unless having a title with keywords will help with SEO. macOS The proper name for Apple's desktop operating system is macOS. Don't use the older product names Mac OS, Mac OS X, or OS X. master account We previously used \"master account\" and \"sub-account\" but now we use parent account and child account. menu The list of pages and indexes on the top and left sides of the New Relic user interface. mouse over For mouse movements that involve placing the mouse pointer over an area, but not clicking it. For example, the APM Overview page includes functions that are only visible when the mouse pointer is over a particular chart. Do not use point to or hover over. See also click. .NET Always refer to the agent and language as .NET, never as .Net or .net or dotnet. New Relic One New Relic One isn't a product. It's a way to view New Relic data more easily, all in one place, and from multiple related accounts. This has several implications for how we should refer to it: Avoid phrasing that makes New Relic One sound like a separate product or a separate platform. There is a single New Relic platform through which our users interact with our products. Avoid mentioning New Relic One where it can be avoided. For example, instead of saying \"Use New Relic One workloads to...\", you could instead say, \"In New Relic, you can use workloads to...\" and then in the doc explain where to find the feature. Another example: instead of referring to \"The programmable New Relic One platform,\" we might say, \"The New Relic platform is programmable: To start building, go to one.newrelic.com and...\" Do not use NR1 or nr1 as an abbreviation of New Relic One. The only reason to use nr1 is when referring to the nr1 package or library (for example: a reference to the command nr1 nerdpack:serve). In general, we want to avoid overloading our docs with \"New Relic\". For more details, see the New Relic One messaging guidelines, the docs glossary entry, or the New Relic One docs. Node.js Always refer to the programming language as Node.js, not Node. NR ONLY Use NR ONLY for internal consumption only (such as this style guide). Don't use NR-ONLY or NRONLY or New Relic Only. Oxford comma See serial comma. open source Use lower case for open source. Some legal contracts may require upper case. page A specific place in the New Relic UI, located at a particular URL. Compare and contrast index, menu, and UI. Don't use dashboard, menu, tab, screen, or similar terms. parent account New Relic organizations can have a parent/child account structure. This is more important for our original user model but still plays a role for some behind-the-scenes features on our New Relic One user model. Learn more about account structure. Parent accounts were previously referred to as master accounts, and there are still some uses of this in the codebase. permissions See User-related language. For pricing tier/edition language, see Pricing language. pricing See Pricing language. real user monitoring (RUM) Don't use this outside of browser monitoring docs. Often abbreviated as RUM, this is a generic industry term for browser monitoring. New Relic refers to this as page load timing or browser monitoring. Use this term only for SEO or clarification, not to refer to the actual feature. record vs. report vs. collect Use report when discussing data sent to New Relic, such as, \"your host reports data to New Relic.\" Avoid using report as a noun. Instead use \"the reported metrics\" or \"the collected data.\" If \"report\" sounds too clunky, you can also use collect as long as whatever New Relic is collecting doesn't sound security sensitive. RPM Don't refer to the New Relic UI as RPM. Always refer to the specific product, such as the APM UI or the Browser UI. However, you may use rpm when required in the visible URL string in UI paths. serial comma Also referred to as an Oxford comma. Always use serial commas with inline lists. For example, Portland, Seattle, and Dublin rather than Portland, Seattle and Dublin. time zone Include a space (time zone). Don't hyphenate or run together as timezone. UI The graphical component of a New Relic product, encompassing all its pages, menus, and indexes. See also UI paths. UI paths If you need to tell a user how to path through the UI, see our style guide page on UI paths. update vs. upgrade Use update when users need to change the version of whatever they're using. No money or payment is needed for an update. Use upgrade whenever money or payment may be involved, such as upgrading to the Pro version of a product. The new pricing model makes it unlikely that you'll need to use this. users For styles and formats related to user roles and groups and more, see User-related style. username, not user name One word (username), not two. This is the most common usage and is recommended by Microsoft and Google style guides. version number references When referring to multiple version numbers, always use or higher. Don't use and higher, or the words greater or later. Also don't use punctuation, as in version 1.2+. For example: Foo requires Ruby agent version 1.2.3 or higher. Copy In addition: Tell users to use the latest version and not an up-to-date or current version. To abbreviate the word version, use a lowercase v with no space before the number; for example, v2 or v1.2.3. Use update not upgrade when talking about agent versions, as in \"To update to the latest version...\" For security reasons, do not use version numbers with licensing docs. The Tech Docs team doesn't have a set standard when referring to previous versions. Recommendation: Consider using version x.x or lower when identifying a specific version. Consider using In earlier agent versions when referring to versions more vaguely. we Say “we” and “our” when it works with the flow of your writing. Avoid overloading paragraphs with “New Relic” mentions, or reword so the focus is on the user, not New Relic. For example, avoid writing something like this: New Relic recommends setting a startup timeout. Copy Instead, write something like this: Recommendation: To help with troubleshooting, include a startup timeout in your configuration. Copy OR We recommend setting a startup timeout. Copy you We use “you” and “your” liberally in our docs. Addressing the reader directly makes for simpler, cleaner sentences. It also tends to expose lazy uses of passive construction and it helps users to understand procedures.",

      "body": "You can't just hit the edit button docs.newrelic.com to make edits to the home page. The page that opens is index.js, the file that manages the parts of the home page, but not the content. It's rare that you'll need to make changes to this file. Most home page changes will be to add a new tile or section to the page, or update links. These types of changes are handled in two files: src/data/homepage.yml - contains home page section titles, section descriptions, and the URLs for tiles. src/i18n/translations/en/translation.json - contains tile info, including the title and short description of tiles. Update a link's URL Change or add new links using homepage.yml. In homepage.yml, search for the link you want to change. Edit the URL, save, commit, and PR the change. Add a new tile to the home page You'll make changes to both homepage.yml and translations.json On the translations.json doc, find the spot where you want to add the new tile (which section, and in what order you want it to appear), and add a new entry with this format: \"t#\": { \"title\": \"tile name\", \"description\": \"Short description.\" }, Copy Make sure you update the number on the tile. If you want to insert it in the middle of a group, update all the subsequent tile numbers as well. Save the file. Open homepage.yml, find the spot where the new tile will be, and add a new line with the relative link for the new tile. For example, - /docs/new-relic-one/use-new-relic-one/workloads/workloads-isolate-resolve-incidents-faster Save and check that your new tile builds properly on a local build. Commit, push, PR when you're ready. Add a new section to the home page On the translations.json page, add a new section modeled in the spot where you want the new section to appear. Include at least one title. For example, here's the TDP entry, with one tile: \"errors-inbox\": { \"title\": \"Errors Inbox\", \"description\": \"A single place to proactively detect, triage, and take action on all the errors before they impact customers.\", \"t1\": { \"title\": \"Introduction to Errors Inbox\", \"description\": \"How to manage all your monitoring in one place.\" }, Copy When you're done creating the info, save the file. In the homepage.yml page, find the corresponding location for the new section, and add the short name you provided in the translation.json file, title, description, and tile URLs. For example, here's the corresponding TDP section on homepage.yml. errors-inbox: title: Errors Inbox description: A single place to proactively detect, triage, and take action on all the errors before they impact customers. tiles: - /docs/errors-inbox/errors-inbox Copy Save, build locally, commit, PR. Edit the home page left nav The left nav of the home page is controlled by src/nav/root.yml. This is a basic yml file, similar to our taxonomy files. Each link on the left nav needs a title and a path: - title: Welcome to New Relic path: /docs/using-new-relic - title: New Relic One path: /docs/new-relic-one/use-new-relic-one - title: Guides and best practices path: /docs/new-relic-solutions - title: section-break - title: Alerts and Applied Intelligence path: /docs/alerts-applied-intelligence Copy You can add a new link by following the pattern above or delete a link by removing the corresponding title and path. Section breaks are added by including a - title: section-break line. The left nav reflects the exact order of root.yml, so it's easy to organize it as needed.",

You can also extend your performance monitoring to collect and analyze business data to help you improve the customer experience and make data-driven business decisions. With flexible options for custom instrumentation and APIs, The Python agent offers multiple building blocks to customize the data you need from your app. Our Python works with a wide variety of web frameworks and hosting mechanisms, including Django, Gunicorn, WSGI, CherryPy, uWSGI, and more. You can also install the Python agent in a Google App Engine flexible environment. Monitor app performance After you install the Python agent, it begins to collect data about your app. You can view the data as charts and tables in New Relic One. View the big picture of your app. Monitor your app's Apdex (user satisfaction). Get a high-level summary of your app with Summary page. Enable distributed tracing to see activity across an architecture having many services.

You can also see logs in context of your infrastructure data, such as Kubernetes clusters. Extend agent instrumentation Other helpful tools include: Tools Description Browser monitoring Integrate the Python agent with browser monitoring to gain visibility into end-user browser activity. Simple scripts and background tasks Monitor job-based or task queuing systems, like Celery, or other standalone non-web functions. Business data analysis with data exploration. Use the Python agent with our data explorer to organize, query, and visualize your data to answer key questions about application performance and customer experience. Use default transaction attributes, or add your own. Query your data using the New Relic Query Language (NRQL). Send your own event data. Create and share customizable, interactive dashboards. Install the Python agent Before you install the Python agent, make sure your system meets the system requirements. You must also create a New Relic account. We support a number of web frameworks and libraries right out of the box, including Django, WSGI, and Gunicorn. If you use one of the supported web frameworks, installation is easy. If you use an unsupported framework, the process will involve some additions to your app code and/or web server files. For a quick and simple install process that will work for the majority of setups, follow these simple steps: Download and install the Python package. Create config file. Integrate the Python agent with your application. Read the Quick Start guide Add Python data Monitor non-web scripts, background tasks, and functions The Python agent also lets you monitor non-web scripts, worker processes, tasks, and functions. The installation process for these non-web transactions is similar to the one used for a web app, with one major difference: instead of going through the standard integration process described in the install instructions, you would manually \"wrap\" any function you want to monitor. For more information, see Non-web tasks and processes. For instructions on monitoring Celery tasks, see Celery background tasks. What's next after installation? Once you get the agent up and running, some suggested next steps are: Explore your data in and get comfortable with the user interface. Read our docs on our other observability solutions and the APM page. Change your application's name, or other configuration options. Learn about setting up custom instrumentation for application activity not monitored by default. Consider the Python Telemetry SDK. Troubleshooting After you complete the install process, your data should appear in the APM UI within five minutes. If it does not, use these troubleshooting resources: If no data appears, follow these troubleshooting steps. If you experience issues when installing or running the Python agent on a new host, test that the package is installed correctly and that it can contact New Relic's data collector service. For other problems, see the full list of troubleshooting documentation. Check the source code The Python agent is open source software. That means you can browse its source code and send improvements, or create your own fork and build it. For more information, see the README.",

Use default transaction attributes or add your own Query your data using NRQL Send your own event data Create and share customizable, interactive dashboards Architecture The PHP agent has two binaries that work together to forward data to New Relic: The agent handles automatic and API instrumentation of your PHP code. The daemon acts as a proxy between the agent and the New Relic platform. You can connect up to 500 applications/agents to one daemon. The daemon imposes sampling when the harvest cycle limits are reached, so consider this when deciding how many applications/agents to connect to a single daemon. Tip The number of applications/agents per daemon may be lower when running in separate Docker containers, depending on the capacity of the connection between containers. The flow of data from your PHP applications to New Relic. The workflow between your application and New Relic must occur in this order: The agent establishes a socket connection with the daemon by sending the first payload of instrumentation data. The daemon establishes an HTTPS link with the New Relic platform. The daemon must be invoked before your instrumented application is invoked. This is called agent mode and is the default. To avoid losing reported data, make sure your instrumented application doesn't send transactions before both connections are established. Install the agent Before you install the PHP agent, ensure your system meets the system requirements. The PHP agent supports many of the most common PHP frameworks, databases, and libraries. You can also use the agent in a Google App Engine (GAE) flexible environment. Tip If you are installing the agent on a shared hosting service, ensure you have root permissions to install the agent or contact your hosting provider for technical assistance. To install the agent, sign up for New Relic first. Once logged in, use our launcher, or see the instructions for specific installations. Add PHP data For standard installations, see: PHP agent installation overview (the basic installation steps for the most common setups). Installing on RedHat or CentOS Installing on Ubuntu or Debian Installing with tar archive (generic method to use on any supported systems such as Linux variants, OpenSolaris, SmartOS, FreeBSD, macOS, etc) The newrelic-install script (how to use the interactive script that automates some installation tasks) For other types of PHP installations and advanced installation topics, see: PHP agent installation: Non-standard PHP Starting the PHP daemon (a standard New Relic installation starts the daemon automatically, but you can also start the daemon manually) Silent mode for the install script Google App Engine (GAE) flex environment installation for New Relic's PHP agent Configure the agent The agent includes a variety of configuration options to further customize and fine-tune your installation. Tip The most important part of agent configuration is to give your app a descriptive name. New Relic uses this app name to aggregate metrics when you have multiple apps or hosts. After changing any agent configuration options, restart your web server. Extend agent instrumentation After installing the agent, go further and extend the agent's instrumentation: Page load timing: Integrate the PHP agent with browser monitoring to gain visibility into end-user activity. Custom instrumentation: Instrument transactions not captured as part of our framework instrumentation. Agent API: Use the agent API to customize the agent's behavior. For example, you can collect custom metrics, flag an error, or ignore a particular transaction entirely. Agent attributes: Customize the attributes attached to transactions. Customizing attributes allows you to avoid sending sensitive attributes, or to collect additional attributes for deeper visibility into your transactions. Troubleshoot your installation If you encounter issues with the PHP agent, see our full list of troubleshooting documentation. Common installation issues include: No data appears (PHP) Determining permissions requirements INI settings not taking effect immediately Why and when to restart your web server (PHP)",

      "body": "These are some organization basics. Organize your page to make it easier to read Consider these organization guidelines when thinking about the order of information in a doc. By following these guidelines, you'll make it easier for readers to skim and find what they need. How to organize information Comments Separate what and why from how. Define any necessary prerequisites, policies, or background information (the what and the why) before you step through the how (step-by-step procedures). Examples: Explain what the feature is and why it matters before telling readers how to use it. Describe any limitations with user permissions or subscription levels that would prevent them from using the feature. If the feature is available for any user or subscription level, don't bother to say so. Provide a roadmap for what users will be able to accomplish, so they know before starting a procedure that they have everything they need. Front-load directions with context. Make sure readers know where they need to be, before telling them what to do. In general, use (select an app) to describe what users select from the product index. Examples: Go to one.newrelic.com > Explorer > (select an app or service). Select (account dropdown) > User preferences. On the command line, type gitk. Also, structure steps by front-loading context from the user's point of view. For example, instead of \"Go to x to do y,\" structure the step as \"To do y, go to x.\" Separate requirements from options. Example: Type the Email you use to sign in and to receive information from New Relic. Optional: Type additional user emails, separated by commas. Follow the \"five to nine\" guideline. Depending on the topic, organize the information so there is a maximum of five to nine chunks of information. For example, readers may start to get lost or overwhelmed after about five h2 sections or seven steps into a procedure. If you have more than nine h2 sections or steps, you might need to create an additional doc or procedure. Other organization tools to consider: Levels of headings Lists Collapsers Callouts Tables Code examples For more help section Use action-oriented titles Wherever possible, give your document or h2 heading a task- or action-oriented title. Focus on what users are trying to accomplish or the problem they're trying to solve. Use present-tense verbs, rather than \"-ing\" verbs. Quality Title example Bad The query history Okay View query history Good Query history: Create and edit NRQL queries Start the document with an introductory paragraph Unless the document is less than a single screen in length, begin with a brief paragraph that introduces the topic or summarizes the important points. Not sure where to start? Try writing all the content for your document first, and then add the introduction to the top to summarize your key points. Or use the introduction to expand on the text in your metaDescription in the metadata. Keep documents short The amount of content needed can help you decide whether you need one or more documents for the topic. If all of the document's contents apply directly to the title, then everything belongs in the same document. If several related sections could be logically split into individual documents, and the overall length of your document is more than about two screenfuls, split those sections into other documents. Be sure to include links to the related contents. If a large document needs to be broken into multiple smaller documents, consider whether they might be best grouped together in their own sub-category. Use the New Relic voice We strive for a voice that's approachable, expert, and visionary. Check out our voice guidelines for how to write content with these qualities. And keep in mind these essential writing tips that apply to any type of documentation. Guidelines Comments Be clear and direct. Remember to: Use present tense. Use active voice; avoid passive voice. Tell users what to do, not what they \"should\" do. If absolutely necessary, tell users what not to do in situations where unexpected results may occur. Whenever possible, provide an alternative suggestion when telling users what not to do. Example: Using active voice with an alternative suggestion for what not to do Do not use your config file to change this setting, because this could affect other processes. Instead, go to one.newrelic.com > APM > (select an app or service) > Settings > Application. Write to aid localization and translation. Do not use euphemisms, idioms, jargon, or slang. Use the same terms and wording consistently. If you need to include an abbreviation or acronym, spell it out the first time it appears in the document. Always take a moment to ask yourself whether people will really understand the terms you are using in the way you're using them. Change doc titles and anchors Because changes to doc titles, anchors, and redirects can break links to other docs, please create an issue to request these types of changes and we'll help you out with that. Create and edit categories Because changes to categories can affect large groups of docs at once, please create an issue to request these types of changes and we'll help you out with that.

      "body": "You can use New Relic's containerized private minions (CPM). These are Docker container-based private minions that accept and execute synthetic monitors against your private locations. The CPM can operate in a Docker container system environment or a Kubernetes container orchestration system environment. The CPM will auto-detect its environment to select the appropriate operating mode. General private minion features Because the CPM operates as a container instead of a virtual machine, it delivers many features: Easy to install, start, and update Runs on: Linux macOS Windows Enhanced security and support for non-root user execution Ability to leverage a Docker container as a sandbox environment Customizable monitor check timeout Custom provided modules for scripted monitor types Kubernetes-specific features Also, the CPM delivers the following features in a Kubernetes environment: Integrates with the Kubernetes API to delegate runtime lifecycle management to Kubernetes Does not require privileged access to the Docker socket Supports hosted and on-premise Kubernetes clusters Supports various container engines such as Docker and Containerd Deployable via Helm charts as well as configuration YAMLs Allows job (ping vs. non-ping checks) based resource allocation for optimum resource management Observability offered via the New Relic One Kubernetes cluster explorer System requirements and compatibility To host CPMs, your system must meet the minimum requirements for the chosen system environment. Caution Do not modify any CPM files. New Relic is not liable for any modifications you make. For more information, contact your account representative or a New Relic technical sales rep. Docker container system environment requirements Compatibility for Requirements Operating system Linux kernel: 3.10 or higher. macOS: 10.11 or higher. Windows: Windows 10 64-bit or higher. You must also configure Docker to run Linux containers in order for CPMs to work on Windows systems. Processor A modern, multi-core CPU Memory 2.5 GiB of RAM per CPU core (dedicated) Disk space A minimum of 10 GB per host Docker version Docker 17.12.1-ce or higher Private location key You must have a private location key Caution The Docker CPM is not designed for use with container orchestrators like AWS ECS, Docker Swarm, Apache Mesos, Azure Container Instances, etc. Running the Docker CPM in a container orchestrator will result in unexpected issues because it is itself a container orchestrator. If you're using container orchestration, see our Kubernetes CPM requirements. Kubernetes container orchestration system environment requirements (CPM v3.0.0 or higher) Compatibility for Requirements Operating system Linux kernel: 3.10 or higher macOS: 10.11 or higher Windows: Windows 10 64-bit or higher Processor A modern, multi-core CPU Minion pod CPU (vCPU/Core): 0.5 up to 0.75 Memory: 800 Mi up to 1.6 Gi Resources allocated to a Minion pod are user configurable. Runner pod CPU (vCPU/Core): 0.5 up to 1 Memory: 1.25 Gi up to 3 Gi For a scripted API check, 1.25 Gi will be requested with a limit of 2.5 Gi. For a simple browser or scripted browser check, 2 Gi will be requested with a limit of 3 Gi. Additional considerations: Resources allocated to a runner pod are not user configurable. The maximum limit-request resource ratio for both CPU and memory is 2. Disk space Persistent volume (PV) of at least 10 Gi in size Note that if a ReadWriteOnce (RWO) PV is provided to the minion, an implicit node affinity will be established to ensure the minion and the runner containers are scheduled on the same node. This is required to allow the minion and the associated runners access to the PV, as an RWO PV can be accessed only by a single node in the cluster. Kubernetes version We recommend that your Kubernetes cluster supports Kubernetes v1.15. Caution We have identified a compatibility issue with Kubernetes v1.21+. A workaround is available by disabling the BoundServiceAccountTokenVolume feature gate on the cluster. Private location key You must have a private location key Helm Follow installation instructions for Helm v3 for your OS. Kubectl Follow installation instructions for Kubectl for your OS. To view versions, dependencies, default values for how many runner pods start with each minion, the Persistent volume access mode, and more, please see Show help and examples below. Private location key Before launching CPMs, you must have a private location key. Your CPM uses the key to authenticate against New Relic and run monitors associated with that private location. To find the key for existing private location: Go to one.newrelic.com > Synthetics > Private locations. In the Private locations index, locate the private location you want your CPM to be assigned to. Note the key associated with the private location with the key icon. Sandboxing and Docker dependencies Sandboxing and Docker dependencies are applicable to the CPM in a Docker container system environment. Docker dependencies The CPM runs in Docker and is able to leverage Docker as a sandboxing technology. This ensures complete isolation of the monitor execution, which improves security, reliability, and repeatability. Every time a scripted or browser monitor is executed, the CPM creates a brand new Docker container to run it in called a runner. The minion container needs to be configured to communicate with the Docker engine in order to spawn additional runner containers. Each spawned container is then dedicated to run a check associated with the synthetic monitor running on the private location the minion container is associated with. There are two crucial dependencies at launch. To enable sandboxing, ensure that: Your writable and executable directory is mounted at /tmp. The writable directory can be any directory you want the CPM to write into, but New Relic recommends the system's own /tmp to make things easy. Your writable Docker UNIX socket is mounted at /var/run/docker.sock or DOCKER_HOST environment variable. For more information, see Docker's Daemon socket option. Caution Core count on the host determines how many runner containers the CPM can run concurrently on the host. Since memory requirements are scaled to the expected count of runner containers, we recommend not running multiple CPMs on the same host to avoid resource contention. For additional information on sandboxing and running as a root or non-root user, see Security, sandboxing, and running as non-root. Install and update CPM versions Both installing and updating the CPM use the same command to pull the latest Docker image from the Quay.io repository where the CPM Docker image is hosted. Go to quay.io/repository/newrelic/synthetics-minion for a list of all the releases. CPM images are also hosted on Docker Hub. Go to hub.docker.com/r/newrelic/synthetics-minion/tags for a list of all the releases. Unless hosting the images in a local image repository, connections to either quay.io or docker.io will need to be allowed through your firewall in order for Docker to pull the synthetics-minion and synthetics-minion-runner images. The \"runner\" image is pulled automatically on startup of the synthetics-minion container. See Docker environment configuration and Kubernetes environment configuration for details on how to set a local repository and the runner registry endpoint. Start the CPM To start the CPM, follow the applicable Docker or Kubernetes instructions. Docker start procedure Locate your private location key. Ensure you've enabled Docker dependencies for sandboxing and installed CPM on your system. Run the appropriate script for your system. Tailor the common defaults for /tmp and /var/run/docker.sock in the following examples to match your system. Linux/macOS: docker run \\ --name YOUR_CONTAINER_NAME \\ -e \"MINION_PRIVATE_LOCATION_KEY=YOUR_PRIVATE_LOCATION_KEY\" \\ -v /tmp:/tmp:rw \\ -v /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock:rw \\ -d \\ --restart unless-stopped \\ quay.io/newrelic/synthetics-minion:latest Copy Windows: docker run ^ --name YOUR_CONTAINER_NAME ^ -e \"MINION_PRIVATE_LOCATION_KEY=YOUR_PRIVATE_LOCATION_KEY\" ^ -v /tmp:/tmp:rw ^ -v /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock:rw ^ -d ^ --restart unless-stopped ^ quay.io/newrelic/synthetics-minion:latest Copy View the logs for your minion container: docker logs --follow YOUR_CONTAINER_NAME Copy When a message similar to Synthetics Minion is ready and servicing location YOUR_PRIVATE_LOCATION_LABEL appears, your CPM is up and ready to run monitors assigned to that location. Kubernetes start procedure Locate your private location key. Set up the a namespace for the CPM in your Kubernetes cluster: kubectl create namespace YOUR_NAMESPACE Copy Copy the Helm charts from the New Relic Helm repo. If you are copying the charts for the first time: helm repo add YOUR_REPO_NAME https://helm-charts.newrelic.com Copy If you previously copied the Helm charts from the New Relic Helm repo, then get the latest: helm repo update Copy Install the CPM with the following Helm command: For a fresh installation of the CPM: helm install YOUR_CPM_NAME YOUR_REPO_NAME/synthetics-minion -n YOUR_NAMESPACE --set synthetics.privateLocationKey=YOUR_PRIVATE_LOCATION_KEY Copy To update an existing CPM installation: helm upgrade YOUR_CPM_NAME YOUR_REPO_NAME/synthetics-minion -n YOUR_NAMESPACE --set synthetics.privateLocationKey=YOUR_PRIVATE_LOCATION_KEY Copy Check if the minion pod is up and running: kubectl get -n YOUR_NAMESPACE pods Copy Once the status attribute of each pod is shown as running, your CPM is up and ready to run monitors assigned to your private location. Stop or delete the CPM On a Docker container system environment, use the Docker stop procedure to stop the CPM from running. On a Kubernetes container orchestration system environment, use the Kubernetes delete procedure to stop the CPM from running. Docker stop procedure You can stop a Docker container either by the container name, or the container ID. Container name stop for Linux, macOS, and Windows: docker stop YOUR_CONTAINER_NAME docker rm YOUR_CONTAINER_NAME Copy Container ID stop for Linux/macOS: In the examples the container is stopped and removed. To only stop the container, omit docker rm $CONTAINER_ID. CONTAINER_ID=$(docker ps -aqf name=YOUR_CONTAINER_NAME) docker stop $CONTAINER_ID docker rm $CONTAINER_ID Copy Container ID stop for Windows: In the examples the container is stopped and removed. To only stop the container, omit docker rm $CONTAINER_ID. FOR /F \"tokens=*\" %%CID IN ('docker ps -aqf name=YOUR_CONTAINER_NAME') do (SET CONTAINER_ID=%%CID) docker stop %CONTAINER_ID% docker rm %CONTAINER_ID% Copy Kubernetes delete procedure Get the MINION_POD_INSTALLATION_NAME of the minion pod you want to delete: helm list -n YOUR_NAMESPACE Copy Delete the minion pod: helm uninstall -n YOUR_NAMESPACE MINION_POD_INSTALLATION_NAME Copy Delete the namespace set up for the CPM in your Kubernetes cluster: kubectl delete namespace YOUR_NAMESPACE Copy Show help and examples Use these options as applicable: To get a list of the most commonly used run options directly in the command line interface, run the show help command. To show CPM usage examples as well as the list of all the available run options, run this command: docker run quay.io/newrelic/synthetics-minion:latest help Copy To keep track of Docker logs and verify the health of your monitors, see Containerized private minion (CPM) maintenance and monitoring. For a CPM in the Kubernetes container orchestration system environment, the following Helm show commands can be used to view the chart.yaml and the values.yaml, respectively: helm show chart YOUR_REPO_NAME/synthetics-minion Copy helm show values YOUR_REPO_NAME/synthetics-minion Copy Show license information To show the licensing information for the open source software that we use in the CPM, run the LICENSE command. Run this command to view license information for CPM versions 2.2.27 or higher: docker run quay.io/newrelic/synthetics-minion:latest LICENSE Copy Some of our open-source software is listed under multiple software licenses, and in that case we have listed the license we've chosen to use. Our license information is also available in the our licenses documentation. Configure CPM You can configure the containerized private minion with custom npm modules, preserve data between launches, use environment variables, and more. For more information, see CPM configuration. Networks For both Docker and Kubernetes, the CPM and its runner containers will inherit network settings from the host. For an example of this on a Docker container system environment, see the Docker site. A new bridge network is created for each runner container. This means networking command options like --network and --dns passed to the CPM container at launch (such as through Docker run commands on a Docker container system environment) are not inherited or used by the runner containers. When these networks are created, they pull from the default IP address pool configured for daemon. For an example of this on a Docker container system environment, see the Docker site. Typically, the runner network is removed after the check is completed. However, if a CPM exits while a check is still running, or exits in another unexpected circumstance, these networks may get orphaned. This can potentially use up IP address space that is available to the Docker daemon. If this happens, you may see INTERNAL ENGINE ERROR code: 31 entries in your CPM logging when trying to create a new runner container. To clean these up in Docker container system environments only, run docker network prune. Security, sandboxing, and running as non-root By default, the software running inside a CPM is executed with root user privileges. This is suitable for most scenarios, as the execution is sandboxed. In a Docker container system environment: To change the default AppArmor profile used by containers that CPM spawns to run monitors, see the environment variable MINION_RUNNER_APPARMOR (CPM version 3.0.3 or higher) or MINION_DOCKER_RUNNER_APPARMOR (CPM version up to v3.0.2). To run the CPM as a non-root user, additional steps are required: Run as non-root user for Docker For more information, see Docker's official documentation about security and AppArmor security profiles. If your environment requires you to run the CPM as a non-root user, follow this procedure. In the following example, the non-root user is my_user. Ensure that my_user can use the Docker engine on the host: Verify that my_user belongs to the \"docker\" system group. OR Enable the Docker TCP socket option, and pass the DOCKER_HOST environment variable to CPM. Verify that my_user has read/write permissions to all the directories and volumes passed to CPM. To set these permission, use the chmod command. Get the uid of my_user for use in the run command: id -u my_user. Once these conditions are met, use the option \"-u <uid>:<gid>\" when launching CPM: docker run ... -u 1002 ... Copy OR docker run ... -u 1002 -e DOCKER_HOST=http://localhost:2375 ... Copy Docker image repository A single CPM Docker image serves both the Docker container system environment and Kubernetes container orchestration system environment. The Docker image is hosted on quay.io. To make sure your Docker image is up-to-date, see the quay.io newrelic/synthetics-minion repository. Additional considerations for CPM connection Connection Description CPMs without Internet access A CPM can operate without access to the internet, but with some exceptions. The public internet health check can be disabled using the environment variables named MINION_NETWORK_HEALTHCHECK_DISABLED for a Docker container system environment or synthetics.minionNetworkHealthCheckDisabled for a Kubernetes container orchestration system environment. The CPM needs to be able to contact the \"synthetics-horde.nr-data.net\" domain. This is necessary for it to report data to New Relic and to receive monitors to execute. Ask your network administration if this is a problem and how to set up exceptions. Communicate with Synthetics via a proxy To set up communication with New Relic by proxy, use the environment variables named MINION_API_PROXY*. Arguments passed at launch This applies to a Docker container environment only. Arguments passed to the CPM container at launch do not get passed on to the containers spawned by the CPM. Docker has no concept of \"inheritance\" or a \"hierarchy\" of containers, and we don't copy the configuration that is passed from CPM to the monitor-running containers. The only shared configuration between them is the one set at the Docker daemon level.",

Collect custom response codes for more detail on your monitor runs. You'll be able to add and configure synthetic monitors to suit your environnment after you create a New Relic account. (It's free, forever!) Add a monitor You can add several types of synthetic monitors: Ping monitors ensure your website is responding, while simple browser monitors send real browsers to check your website. For more complex monitoring, scripted browser monitors verify that specific resources are present, while API tests verify your API endpoint. The default timeout for a new monitor is 180 seconds. Add a ping or simple browser monitor Go to one.newrelic.com > Synthetics > Create monitor. Specify a monitor type, name, and URL (may be any valid HTTP or HTTPS URL). Optional: Add a validation string or Advanced options: A validation string is available for ping and simple browser. This option enables substring monitoring for response validation. Verify SSL is available for ping and simple browser. This option verifies the validity of the SSL certificate chain.

Select the locations from which you want your monitor to run, and then click Save monitor to confirm. Generate some traffic and wait a few minutes, then check your monitor from the Monitors index. Add a broken links monitor Go to one.newrelic.com > Synthetics > Create monitor. Select the broken links check monitor type. Specify a name and enter the URL you'd like to monitor (may be any valid HTTP or HTTPS URL). Select the period to determine your monitor's frequency. Optional: Add tags to help you find this monitor later. Select the locations from which you want your monitor to run, and then click Save monitor to confirm. Generate some traffic and wait a few minutes, then check your monitor from the Monitors index. Tip You can also add monitors with the Synthetics REST API. For example, you can create a GET request to the monitor you want to use as the source for configuration, then use those key values to use in a POST to \"copy\" and create a new monitor. Edit a monitor You cannot change a monitor's type after the monitor is created, but you can edit other monitor settings. From the Monitors tab in one.newrelic.com > Synthetics, select the monitor you want to edit. In the side menu, select a link to change the following settings: Select Settings > General to edit name, Apdex T, URL, locations, frequency, and advanced options. For Scripted browser and API test monitors, select Settings > Script to edit your monitor script. For synthetic monitoring alerts, click Manage alerts. Select Save changes to confirm. Delete a monitor To delete a monitor: From the Monitors tab in one.newrelic.com > Synthetics, select the monitor you want to edit. From the selected monitor, select Settings > General. Scroll to the bottom of the page and select the trash can icon. Tip You can also delete a monitor with the Synthetics REST API. Monitor settings When configuring monitors, the following settings are available: Type Select the type of monitor you want to create. A monitor's type can't be changed after the monitor is created. Ping: Specify a single URL to monitor for availability. New Relic will check this URL via HEAD or GET requests. The non-configurable timeout for this monitor is 60 seconds. Simple browser: Specify a single URL to monitor via real browser. Once each frequency interval, New Relic will check this URL via a Selenium-powered Google Chrome browser. The non-configurable timeout for this monitor is 60 seconds. Scripted browser: Create a script to drive a Selenium-powered Google Chrome browser. The browser follows each step in the script to verify that complex behavior is working as expected (for example, searching a website, then clicking one of the search results). The non-configurable timeout for this monitor is 180 seconds. API test: Create an API script to ensure your API endpoint is working correctly. For more information, see Write API tests. The non-configurable timeout for this monitor is 180 seconds. Monitor name Defines a name for the monitor. Monitor names cannot contain unencoded angle brackets (< >). To include angle brackets in a monitor name, encode them as HTML bracket entities (&lt; &gt;) in the UI or API. Location Select the locations where you want your monitor to run. Select more locations to ensure that your application is available to users around the world. If you have any private locations, they will be listed here too. You can use the Synthetics API location endpoint to retrieve a list of valid locations for your account. Your monitor will run one check from each selected location during each frequency interval. For example, if you select three locations and define a frequency of 15 minutes, your monitor will run three checks in each 15 minute period (or 8,640 checks per month). Frequency Select how often the monitor runs, in increments of minutes, hours, or 1 day. This frequency applies to each location. For example, if you select three locations and a Frequency of 15 minutes, your monitor will run three checks, on average every 5 minutes, in each 15 minute period (or 8,640 checks per month). Alerts Specify an email address to receive alerts when a monitor fails. Or, attach a monitor to an existing alert policy for more notification options. For more information, see Alerting for synthetic monitoring. Apdex T Customize the Apdex T for this monitor. This setting is only available when editing the settings for an existing monitor, not when creating a new monitor. Change the Apdex T from the default 7 seconds for more accurate Apdex scores in your SLA reports. For example, if you have a very long scripted browser, you might adjust the Apdex T to 15 seconds to more closely reflect the usual completion time. Similarly, a good Apdex T for a simple browser check might be only 2 seconds. Response Validation (optional) Specify text to search for on the page. When using simple browser or ping monitor types, there is a 1MB (10^6 bytes) limit on the page load. See a history of monitor changes You can use New Relic One to see a history of recent changes to synthetic monitors and what users changed them.",

You can also view SLA reports for individual monitors: Go to one.newrelic.com > Synthetics > (select a monitor) > SLA. one.newrelic.com > Synthetics > SLA Report: Use SLA reports to understand your monitors' performance over time. Understand SLA report metrics Use SLA reports to view aggregated performance metrics for a single monitor, or for all your monitors from the account-wide SLA Reports page. SLA reports include the following metrics: Duration: The average duration across all monitor results. Uptime: The percentage of all monitor results that ended successfully. For example, Monitor A might check 50 times per day, and Monitor B might check 150 times per day. If Monitor A has 29 successes out of 50 and Monitor B has 148 successes out of 150, the Uptime would be 88.5: (29+148)/(50+150)=88.5 For individual SLA reports, the uptime score only includes the selected monitor. Apdex: The average Apdex across all monitors. Monitors have a default Apdex T of 7 seconds, but you can customize Apdex T for individual monitors by editing their settings. Apdex F, which defines a frustrating result, is always four times Apdex T. For more information about Apdex, see Apdex: Measuring user satisfaction. For individual SLA reports, the Apdex score only includes the selected monitor. % Satisfied: The percentage of monitor results which complete in a \"satisfying\" time. A satisfying time is defined as a monitor result that completes in Apdex T or less. % Toleration: The percentage of monitor results which complete in a \"tolerable\" time. A tolerable time is greater than Apdex T, but less than Apdex F (four times Apdex T). % Frustrated: The percentage of monitor results which complete in a \"frustrating\" time. A frustrating time is greater than Apdex F (four times Apdex T). The account-wide SLA report includes all monitor types (ping, simple browser, scripted browser, and API test).

The duration attribute in the SyntheticCheck event is stored in milliseconds, so an Apdex T value of 7 seconds should be included as 7000. timeperiod This is the period that you would like to calculate on. For a daily report, facet on dateOf(timestamp), for a weekly report facet on weekOf(timestamp) and for a monthly report facet on monthOf(timestamp).

Use this graph to see if third-party websites are affecting your website's performance. Irregular response codes: Graphs the number of negative HTTP response codes (also called HTTP status codes) received by the monitor. This graph includes all responses in the 300 (redirection), 400 (client error), and 500 (server error) ranges. It does not count responses in the 100 or 200 ranges. Synthetics also collects a number of custom response codes. By analyzing these metrics, you can track down troublesome resources and improve their performance.

      "body": "Use the Synthetics REST API to create and manage synthetic monitors of all types: ping, simple browser, scripted browser, and API test monitors. All synthetic monitoring data is available via the REST API. To use the Synthetics REST API, you must have a user role that allows that capability and a user key. For an overview of all available New Relic APIs, see Intro to APIs. Features The newest version of the Synthetics API (v3) adds these features: Synthetics API (v3) Features Options field for POST and PUT request You can specify the options for SIMPLE and BROWSER type monitors, similar to the way these options are available in the UI. PATCH request You can update only the fields of a monitor you want to change, rather than having to specify the entire monitor entity in a PUT. You can also specify the OPTION, assuming you are using the appropriate type of monitor. More detail with 400 Bad Request errors As of v3, the Synthetics API attempts to return as much information as possible when a validation failure occurs. This will help you figure out what might be wrong with the request. The API runs all validations and returns any failed validation messages, rather than failing on the first validation error as occurred in previous API versions. Pagination Large API responses are properly paginated. You can also use NRQL queries to analyze past changes made via the API. Monitor types in API These are the monitor types and how they're referred to in the API: Monitor type API name Ping SIMPLE Simple browser BROWSER Scripted browser SCRIPT_BROWSER API test SCRIPT_API Use the API To use the Synthetics REST API, you must have the ability to manage synthetics monitors and use a user key (the REST API key won't work). This API can be used for all Synthetics monitors. (Additional API methods for scripted browser and API test monitors are also available to update the script associated with those monitors.) All Synthetics data is available via the API. API examples show cURL commands. For US-based accounts, use the following endpoint: https://synthetics.newrelic.com/synthetics/api Copy For EU-based accounts, use the following endpoint: https://synthetics.eu.newrelic.com/synthetics/api Copy Caution The Synthetics REST API limits an account's rate of requests to three requests per second. Requests made in excess of this threshold will return a 429 response code. Get all monitors To view a list of all the monitors in your New Relic account, send a GET request to $API_ENDPOINT/v3/monitors. For example: curl -v \\ -H 'Api-Key:$API_KEY' $API_ENDPOINT/v3/monitors Copy A successful request will return a 200 OK response. The data returned will be a JSON object in the following format: { \"monitors\": [ { \"id\": \"2a1bc369-7654-489d-918e-f6g135h7i2jk\", \"name\": \"monitor1\", \"type\": \"BROWSER\", \"frequency\": 60, \"uri\": \"http://example.com\", \"locations\": [ \"AWS_US_WEST_1\" ], \"status\": \"DISABLED\", \"slaThreshold\": 7, \"options\": {}, \"modifiedAt\": \"2016-09-26T23:12:46.981+0000\", \"createdAt\": \"2016-09-26T23:12:46.981+0000\", \"userId\": 0, \"apiVersion\": \"0.2.2\" } ], \"count\": 1 } Copy Query arguments: offset: The monitor count offset. Defaults to 0. For example, if you have 40 monitors and you use an offset value of 20, it will return monitors 21-40. limit: The number of results per page, maximum 100. Defaults to 50. You can include these in your cURL command as follows: curl -v \\ -H 'Api-Key:$API_KEY' $API_ENDPOINT/v3/monitors \\ -G -d 'offset=20&limit=100' Copy The headers include a Link to help you easily page your monitors. For example: <https://synthetics.newrelic.com/synthetics/api/v3/monitors/?offset=0&limit=20>; rel=\"first\", <https://synthetics.newrelic.com/synthetics/api/v3/monitors/?offset=40&limit=20>; rel=\"last\" Copy Get a specific monitor To view a single Synthetics monitor, send a GET request to $API_ENDPOINT/v3/monitors/$MONITOR_ID. curl -v \\ -H 'Api-Key:$API_KEY' $API_ENDPOINT/v3/monitors/$MONITOR_ID Copy A successful request will return a 200 OK response. The data returned will be a JSON object in the following format: { \"id\": UUID, \"name\": string, \"type\": string, \"frequency\": integer, \"uri\": string, \"locations\": array of strings, \"status\": string, \"slaThreshold\": double, \"userId\": integer, \"apiVersion\": string } Copy An invalid monitor ID will return 404 Not Found: The specified monitor doesn't exist. Create a monitor To add a new monitor to your Synthetics account, send a POST request to $API_ENDPOINT/v3/monitors with a JSON payload that describes the monitor. All fields in the following example are required unless stated otherwise: { \"name\": string [required], \"type\": string (SIMPLE, BROWSER, SCRIPT_API, SCRIPT_BROWSER) [required], \"frequency\": integer (minutes) [required, must be one of 1, 5, 10, 15, 30, 60, 360, 720, or 1440], \"uri\": string [required for SIMPLE and BROWSER type], \"locations\": array of strings [at least one required], \"status\": string (ENABLED, MUTED, DISABLED) [required], \"slaThreshold\": double, \"options\": { \"validationString\": string [only valid for SIMPLE and BROWSER types], \"verifySSL\": boolean (true, false) [only valid for SIMPLE and BROWSER types], \"bypassHEADRequest\": boolean (true, false) [only valid for SIMPLE types], \"treatRedirectAsFailure\": boolean (true, false) [only valid for SIMPLE types] } } Copy In addition, to add the script for a scripted monitor via the REST API, call an additional API endpoint to send the script for the monitor just created. If you are using private locations with verified script execution enabled, see script locations with verified script execution. Replace the Synthetics REST API attributes in the following example with your specific values: curl -v \\ -X POST -H 'Api-Key:$API_KEY' \\ -H 'Content-Type: application/json' $API_ENDPOINT/v3/monitors \\ -d '{ \"name\" : \"monitor1\", \"frequency\" : 15, \"uri\" : \"http://my-uri.com\", \"locations\" : [ \"AWS_US_WEST_1\" ], \"type\" : \"browser\", \"status\" : \"enabled\", \"slaThreshold\" : \"1.0\"}' Copy A successful request will return a 201 Created response, with the URI of the newly-created monitor specified in the location header. Possible error codes include: 400 Bad Request: One or more of the monitor values is invalid, or the format of the request is invalid. For example: the frequency is out of bounds or one or more of the specified locations is invalid. (See the error message in the body of the response.) 402 Payment Required: Creating the monitor will increase your scheduled checks past your account's purchased check limit. Update an existing monitor To update an existing monitor in New Relic, send a PUT request to $API_ENDPOINT/v3/monitors/$MONITOR_ID. In addition, for scripted monitors, follow the procedures to update the BASE64 encoded script. All fields are required. However, the TYPE of the monitor cannot be changed. Use a specific monitor ID, and replace the Synthetics REST API attributes with your specific values. curl -v \\ -X PUT -H 'Api-Key:$API_KEY' \\ -H 'Content-Type: application/json' $API_ENDPOINT/v3/monitors/$MONITOR_ID \\ -d '{ \"name\" : \"updated monitor name\", \"type\": \"monitor type\", \"frequency\" : 15, \"uri\" : \"http://my-uri.com/\", \"locations\" : [ \"AWS_US_WEST_1\" ], \"status\" : \"enabled\", \"slaThreshold\": \"7.0\" }' Copy PUT requests are intended to replace target entities, so all attributes required in the JSON payload when creating a new monitor are also required when updating an existing monitor. A successful request will return a 204 No Content response, with an empty body. Possible error codes include: 400 Bad Request: One or more of the monitor values is invalid, or the format of the request is invalid. For example, the frequency is out of bounds or one or more of the specified locations is invalid. (See the error message in the body of the response.) 404 Not Found: The specified monitor does not exist. Patch an existing monitor To patch an existing monitor in New Relic, send a PATCH request to $API_ENDPOINT/v3/monitors/$MONITOR_ID. Use a specific monitor ID, and replace the Synthetics REST API attributes with your specific values. curl -v \\ -X PATCH -H 'Api-Key:$API_KEY' \\ -H 'Content-Type: application/json' $API_ENDPOINT/v3/monitors/$MONITOR_ID \\ -d '{ \"name\" : \"updated monitor name\" }' Copy PATCH requests are intended to update individual attributes of your New Relic Synthetics monitor rather than updating the entire entity, so you may provide only the attributes you want to update. A successful request will return a 204 No Content response, with an empty body. Possible error codes include: 400 Bad Request: One or more of the monitor values is invalid, or the format of the request is invalid. For example, the frequency is out of bounds, or one or more of the specified locations is invalid. (See the error message in the body of the response.) 404 Not Found: The specified monitor does not exist. Delete an existing monitor To delete an existing monitor in New Relic Synthetics, send a DELETE request to $API_ENDPOINT/v3/monitors/$MONITOR_ID: curl -v \\ -H 'Api-Key:$API_KEY' \\ -X DELETE $API_ENDPOINT/v3/monitors/$MONITOR_ID Copy A successful request will return a 204 No Content response, with an empty body. An unsuccessful request will return the response 404 Not Found: The specified monitor does not exist. Get a list of valid locations To retrieve the list of valid locations in New Relic Synthetics, use the following command: curl -v \\ -X GET -H 'Api-Key:$API_KEY' $API_ENDPOINT/v1/locations Copy Script API for scripted browser and API test monitors In addition to the general API, there are several API methods for the scripted browsers (SCRIPT_BROWSER) and API test browsers (SCRIPT_API). These examples show cURL commands. Get monitor script To view the script associated with a specific SCRIPT_BROWSER or SCRIPT_API monitor in New Relic Synthetics for your account, send a GET request to $API_ENDPOINT/v3/monitors/$MONITOR_ID/script. For example: curl -v -H 'Api-Key: $API_KEY' $API_ENDPOINT/v3/monitors/$MONITOR_ID/script Copy A successful request will return a 200 OK response. The data returned will be a JSON object in the following format: { \"scriptText\": BASE64 encoded string } Copy Possible error codes include: 403 Forbidden: The specified monitor is not of type SCRIPT_BROWSER or SCRIPT_API. 404 Not Found: The specified monitor doesn't exist or the script associated with the monitor doesn't exist. Add scripted monitor To add a new scripted monitor to New Relic Synthetics with the REST API: Follow standard API procedures to add a new monitor, and identify the type as a SCRIPT_BROWSER or SCRIPT_API. Update the new monitor with a BASE64 encoded version of the script to the $MONITOR_UUID/script endpoint. For more information, refer to the example. If you are using private locations with verified script execution enabled, see script locations with verified script execution. Update monitor script To update the script associated with a specific SCRIPT_BROWSER or SCRIPT_API monitor in New Relic Synthetics for your account, send a PUT request to $API_ENDPOINT/v3/monitors/$MONITOR_ID/script with a JSON payload that contains the scriptText (required). scriptPayload='{\"scriptText\":BASE64 encoded string}' curl -v -X PUT \\ -H 'Api-Key:$API_KEY' \\ -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \\ $API_ENDPOINT/v3/monitors/$MONITOR_UUID/script \\ -d $scriptPayload Copy If you are using private locations with verified script execution enabled, see script locations with verified script execution. A successful request will return a 204 No Content response with an empty body. Possible error codes include: 400 Bad Request: Invalid BASE64 encoded string for scriptText or hmac. 403 Forbidden: The specified monitor is not of the type SCRIPT_BROWSER or SCRIPT_API. 404 Not Found: The specified monitor does not exist. Using private location scripts with verified script execution When creating or updating monitors for private locations that have verified script execution turned on, you must use scriptLocations to set the password: { \"scriptText\": BASE64 encoded String, \"scriptLocations\": [ { \"name\": Location name, \"hmac\" BASE64 encoded String of SHA256 HMAC for location } ] } Copy The password used to generate the HMAC string must match the password set for the private location. If you have multiple locations with Verified script execution enabled each location must have the HMAC calculated. When generating the HMAC string, use the SHA256 algorithm with the script and password. Here's an example for the script: var assert = require('assert'); assert.equal('1', '1'); Copy This example uses password as the password for the scriptLocation: curl -v -X PUT -H 'Api-Key: '$API_KEY' -H 'content-type: application/json' $API_ENDPOINT}/v3/monitors/$MONITOR_ID/script -d '{ \"scriptText\": \"dmFyIGFzc2VydCA9IHJlcXVpcmUoJ2Fzc2VydCcpOw0KYXNzZXJ0LmVxdWFsKCcxJywgJzEnKTs=\",\"scriptLocations\": [ { \"name\": \"my_vse_enabled_location\", \"hmac\": \"MjhiNGE4MjVlMDE1N2M4NDQ4MjNjNDFkZDEyYTRjMmUzZDE3NGJlNjU0MWFmOTJlMzNiODExOGU2ZjhkZTY4ZQ==\"} ]}' Copy Important You must remove the last newline character from both the script and the calculated HMAC value before encoding in BASE64. Calculation steps: Calculate the HMAC value from the script. One way is to use: cat script | openssl dgst -sha256 -hmac \"password\" > hmac Remove the newline character if one was added by openssl. Encode the HMAC in BASE64 without line breaks. Scripted browser example Here is an example of using New Relic's REST API and the bash script to create a scripted browser monitor. Scripted browser API example The following example shows cURL commands to create a scripted browser monitor. At the top of the script, replace the variables with your specific values. For the scriptfile variable, identify the filename for the script to be created. Here is a sample script that can be saved as sample_synth_script.js to use in the example: var assert = require(\"assert\"); $browser.get(\"http://example.com\").then(function(){ // Check the H1 title matches \"Example Domain\" return $browser.findElement($driver.By.css(\"h1\")).then(function(element){ return element.getText().then(function(text){ assert.equal(\"Example Domain\", text, \"Page H1 title did not match\"); }); }); }).then(function(){ // Check that the external link matches \"http://www.iana.org/domains/example\" return $browser.findElement($driver.By.css(\"div > p > a\")).then(function(element){ return element.getAttribute(\"href\").then(function(link){ assert.equal(\"http://www.iana.org/domains/example\", link, \"More information link did not match\"); }); }); }); Copy Bash script example This example shows the bash script that will create the SCRIPTED_BROWSER monitor. Tip In some cases you may want to use -w 0, which will disable line wrapping: base64 -w 0 $scriptfile #!/bin/bash # API key from your account settings API_KEY='' # Other attributes found at https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/apis/synthetics-rest-api/monitor-examples/attributes-synthetics-rest-api#api-attributes monitorName='Test API Script' monitorType='SCRIPT_BROWSER' frequency=1440 locations='\"AWS_US_WEST_1\", \"AWS_US_EAST_1\"' slaThreshold=7.0 # Location of the file with your script scriptfile=sample_synth_script.js # Test that the script file exists (does not validate content) if [ -e \"$scriptfile\" ] then script=$(cat \"$scriptfile\") payload=\"{ \\\"name\\\" : \\\"$monitorName\\\", \\\"frequency\\\" : $frequency, \\\"locations\\\" : [ $locations ], \\\"status\\\" : \\\"ENABLED\\\", \\\"type\\\" : \\\"$monitorType\\\", \\\"slaThreshold\\\" : $slaThreshold, \\\"uri\\\":\\\"\\\"}\" echo \"Creating monitor\" # Make cURL call to API and parse response headers to get monitor UUID shopt -s extglob # Required to trim whitespace; see below while IFS=':' read key value; do # trim whitespace in \"value\" value=${value##+([[:space:]])}; value=${value%%+([[:space:]])} case \"$key\" in location) LOCATION=\"$value\" ;; HTTP*) read PROTO STATUS MSG <<< \"$key{$value:+:$value}\" ;; esac done < <(curl -sS -i -X POST -H \"Api-Key:$API_KEY\" -H 'Content-Type:application/json' https://synthetics.newrelic.com/synthetics/api/v3/monitors -d \"$payload\") # Validate monitor creation & add script unless it failed if [ $STATUS = 201 ]; then echo \"Monitor created, $LOCATION \" echo \"Uploading script\" # base64 encode script encoded=`echo \"$script\" | base64` scriptPayload=\"{\\\"scriptText\\\":\\\"$encoded\\\"}\" curl -s -X PUT -H \"Api-Key:$API_KEY\" -H 'Content-Type:application/json' \"$LOCATION/script\" -d $scriptPayload echo \"Script uploaded\" else echo \"Monitor creation failed\" fi else echo \"script file not found, not creating monitor\" fi Copy",

For an explanation of user models and how they relate to our pricing models, see Overview of pricing and user changes. Users on original user model For users on our original user model, access will vary depending on whether you have default roles or custom roles: Default access Admins have full access to all synthetic monitoring features on an account. Users have access to all synthetic monitoring features except secure credentials and the ability to delete monitors, monitor downtime, and private locations.

      "body": "You can use New Relic's containerized private minions (CPM). These are Docker container-based private minions that accept and execute synthetic monitors against your private locations. The CPM can operate in a Docker container system environment or a Kubernetes container orchestration system environment. The CPM will auto-detect its environment to select the appropriate operating mode. General private minion features Because the CPM operates as a container instead of a virtual machine, it delivers many features: Easy to install, start, and update Runs on: Linux macOS Windows Enhanced security and support for non-root user execution Ability to leverage a Docker container as a sandbox environment Customizable monitor check timeout Custom provided modules for scripted monitor types Kubernetes-specific features Also, the CPM delivers the following features in a Kubernetes environment: Integrates with the Kubernetes API to delegate runtime lifecycle management to Kubernetes Does not require privileged access to the Docker socket Supports hosted and on-premise Kubernetes clusters Supports various container engines such as Docker and Containerd Deployable via Helm charts as well as configuration YAMLs Allows job (ping vs. non-ping checks) based resource allocation for optimum resource management Observability offered via the New Relic One Kubernetes cluster explorer System requirements and compatibility To host CPMs, your system must meet the minimum requirements for the chosen system environment. Caution Do not modify any CPM files. New Relic is not liable for any modifications you make. For more information, contact your account representative or a New Relic technical sales rep. Docker container system environment requirements Compatibility for Requirements Operating system Linux kernel: 3.10 or higher. macOS: 10.11 or higher. Windows: Windows 10 64-bit or higher. You must also configure Docker to run Linux containers in order for CPMs to work on Windows systems. Processor A modern, multi-core CPU Memory 2.5 GiB of RAM per CPU core (dedicated) Disk space A minimum of 10 GB per host Docker version Docker 17.12.1-ce or higher Private location key You must have a private location key Caution The Docker CPM is not designed for use with container orchestrators like AWS ECS, Docker Swarm, Apache Mesos, Azure Container Instances, etc. Running the Docker CPM in a container orchestrator will result in unexpected issues because it is itself a container orchestrator. If you're using container orchestration, see our Kubernetes CPM requirements. Kubernetes container orchestration system environment requirements (CPM v3.0.0 or higher) Compatibility for Requirements Operating system Linux kernel: 3.10 or higher macOS: 10.11 or higher Windows: Windows 10 64-bit or higher Processor A modern, multi-core CPU Minion pod CPU (vCPU/Core): 0.5 up to 0.75 Memory: 800 Mi up to 1.6 Gi Resources allocated to a Minion pod are user configurable. Runner pod CPU (vCPU/Core): 0.5 up to 1 Memory: 1.25 Gi up to 3 Gi For a scripted API check, 1.25 Gi will be requested with a limit of 2.5 Gi. For a simple browser or scripted browser check, 2 Gi will be requested with a limit of 3 Gi. Additional considerations: Resources allocated to a runner pod are not user configurable. The maximum limit-request resource ratio for both CPU and memory is 2. Disk space Persistent volume (PV) of at least 10 Gi in size Note that if a ReadWriteOnce (RWO) PV is provided to the minion, an implicit node affinity will be established to ensure the minion and the runner containers are scheduled on the same node. This is required to allow the minion and the associated runners access to the PV, as an RWO PV can be accessed only by a single node in the cluster. Kubernetes version We recommend that your Kubernetes cluster supports Kubernetes v1.15. Caution We have identified a compatibility issue with Kubernetes v1.21+. A workaround is available by disabling the BoundServiceAccountTokenVolume feature gate on the cluster. Private location key You must have a private location key Helm Follow installation instructions for Helm v3 for your OS. Kubectl Follow installation instructions for Kubectl for your OS. To view versions, dependencies, default values for how many runner pods start with each minion, the Persistent volume access mode, and more, please see Show help and examples below. Private location key Before launching CPMs, you must have a private location key. Your CPM uses the key to authenticate against New Relic and run monitors associated with that private location. To find the key for existing private location: Go to one.newrelic.com > Synthetics > Private locations. In the Private locations index, locate the private location you want your CPM to be assigned to. Note the key associated with the private location with the key icon. Sandboxing and Docker dependencies Sandboxing and Docker dependencies are applicable to the CPM in a Docker container system environment. Docker dependencies The CPM runs in Docker and is able to leverage Docker as a sandboxing technology. This ensures complete isolation of the monitor execution, which improves security, reliability, and repeatability. Every time a scripted or browser monitor is executed, the CPM creates a brand new Docker container to run it in called a runner. The minion container needs to be configured to communicate with the Docker engine in order to spawn additional runner containers. Each spawned container is then dedicated to run a check associated with the synthetic monitor running on the private location the minion container is associated with. There are two crucial dependencies at launch. To enable sandboxing, ensure that: Your writable and executable directory is mounted at /tmp. The writable directory can be any directory you want the CPM to write into, but New Relic recommends the system's own /tmp to make things easy. Your writable Docker UNIX socket is mounted at /var/run/docker.sock or DOCKER_HOST environment variable. For more information, see Docker's Daemon socket option. Caution Core count on the host determines how many runner containers the CPM can run concurrently on the host. Since memory requirements are scaled to the expected count of runner containers, we recommend not running multiple CPMs on the same host to avoid resource contention. For additional information on sandboxing and running as a root or non-root user, see Security, sandboxing, and running as non-root. Install and update CPM versions Both installing and updating the CPM use the same command to pull the latest Docker image from the Quay.io repository where the CPM Docker image is hosted. Go to quay.io/repository/newrelic/synthetics-minion for a list of all the releases. CPM images are also hosted on Docker Hub. Go to hub.docker.com/r/newrelic/synthetics-minion/tags for a list of all the releases. Unless hosting the images in a local image repository, connections to either quay.io or docker.io will need to be allowed through your firewall in order for Docker to pull the synthetics-minion and synthetics-minion-runner images. The \"runner\" image is pulled automatically on startup of the synthetics-minion container. See Docker environment configuration and Kubernetes environment configuration for details on how to set a local repository and the runner registry endpoint. Start the CPM To start the CPM, follow the applicable Docker or Kubernetes instructions. Docker start procedure Locate your private location key. Ensure you've enabled Docker dependencies for sandboxing and installed CPM on your system. Run the appropriate script for your system. Tailor the common defaults for /tmp and /var/run/docker.sock in the following examples to match your system. Linux/macOS: docker run \\ --name YOUR_CONTAINER_NAME \\ -e \"MINION_PRIVATE_LOCATION_KEY=YOUR_PRIVATE_LOCATION_KEY\" \\ -v /tmp:/tmp:rw \\ -v /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock:rw \\ -d \\ --restart unless-stopped \\ quay.io/newrelic/synthetics-minion:latest Copy Windows: docker run ^ --name YOUR_CONTAINER_NAME ^ -e \"MINION_PRIVATE_LOCATION_KEY=YOUR_PRIVATE_LOCATION_KEY\" ^ -v /tmp:/tmp:rw ^ -v /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock:rw ^ -d ^ --restart unless-stopped ^ quay.io/newrelic/synthetics-minion:latest Copy View the logs for your minion container: docker logs --follow YOUR_CONTAINER_NAME Copy When a message similar to Synthetics Minion is ready and servicing location YOUR_PRIVATE_LOCATION_LABEL appears, your CPM is up and ready to run monitors assigned to that location. Kubernetes start procedure Locate your private location key. Set up the a namespace for the CPM in your Kubernetes cluster: kubectl create namespace YOUR_NAMESPACE Copy Copy the Helm charts from the New Relic Helm repo. If you are copying the charts for the first time: helm repo add YOUR_REPO_NAME https://helm-charts.newrelic.com Copy If you previously copied the Helm charts from the New Relic Helm repo, then get the latest: helm repo update Copy Install the CPM with the following Helm command: For a fresh installation of the CPM: helm install YOUR_CPM_NAME YOUR_REPO_NAME/synthetics-minion -n YOUR_NAMESPACE --set synthetics.privateLocationKey=YOUR_PRIVATE_LOCATION_KEY Copy To update an existing CPM installation: helm upgrade YOUR_CPM_NAME YOUR_REPO_NAME/synthetics-minion -n YOUR_NAMESPACE --set synthetics.privateLocationKey=YOUR_PRIVATE_LOCATION_KEY Copy Check if the minion pod is up and running: kubectl get -n YOUR_NAMESPACE pods Copy Once the status attribute of each pod is shown as running, your CPM is up and ready to run monitors assigned to your private location. Stop or delete the CPM On a Docker container system environment, use the Docker stop procedure to stop the CPM from running. On a Kubernetes container orchestration system environment, use the Kubernetes delete procedure to stop the CPM from running. Docker stop procedure You can stop a Docker container either by the container name, or the container ID. Container name stop for Linux, macOS, and Windows: docker stop YOUR_CONTAINER_NAME docker rm YOUR_CONTAINER_NAME Copy Container ID stop for Linux/macOS: In the examples the container is stopped and removed. To only stop the container, omit docker rm $CONTAINER_ID. CONTAINER_ID=$(docker ps -aqf name=YOUR_CONTAINER_NAME) docker stop $CONTAINER_ID docker rm $CONTAINER_ID Copy Container ID stop for Windows: In the examples the container is stopped and removed. To only stop the container, omit docker rm $CONTAINER_ID. FOR /F \"tokens=*\" %%CID IN ('docker ps -aqf name=YOUR_CONTAINER_NAME') do (SET CONTAINER_ID=%%CID) docker stop %CONTAINER_ID% docker rm %CONTAINER_ID% Copy Kubernetes delete procedure Get the MINION_POD_INSTALLATION_NAME of the minion pod you want to delete: helm list -n YOUR_NAMESPACE Copy Delete the minion pod: helm uninstall -n YOUR_NAMESPACE MINION_POD_INSTALLATION_NAME Copy Delete the namespace set up for the CPM in your Kubernetes cluster: kubectl delete namespace YOUR_NAMESPACE Copy Show help and examples Use these options as applicable: To get a list of the most commonly used run options directly in the command line interface, run the show help command. To show CPM usage examples as well as the list of all the available run options, run this command: docker run quay.io/newrelic/synthetics-minion:latest help Copy To keep track of Docker logs and verify the health of your monitors, see Containerized private minion (CPM) maintenance and monitoring. For a CPM in the Kubernetes container orchestration system environment, the following Helm show commands can be used to view the chart.yaml and the values.yaml, respectively: helm show chart YOUR_REPO_NAME/synthetics-minion Copy helm show values YOUR_REPO_NAME/synthetics-minion Copy Show license information To show the licensing information for the open source software that we use in the CPM, run the LICENSE command. Run this command to view license information for CPM versions 2.2.27 or higher: docker run quay.io/newrelic/synthetics-minion:latest LICENSE Copy Some of our open-source software is listed under multiple software licenses, and in that case we have listed the license we've chosen to use. Our license information is also available in the our licenses documentation. Configure CPM You can configure the containerized private minion with custom npm modules, preserve data between launches, use environment variables, and more. For more information, see CPM configuration. Networks For both Docker and Kubernetes, the CPM and its runner containers will inherit network settings from the host. For an example of this on a Docker container system environment, see the Docker site. A new bridge network is created for each runner container. This means networking command options like --network and --dns passed to the CPM container at launch (such as through Docker run commands on a Docker container system environment) are not inherited or used by the runner containers. When these networks are created, they pull from the default IP address pool configured for daemon. For an example of this on a Docker container system environment, see the Docker site. Typically, the runner network is removed after the check is completed. However, if a CPM exits while a check is still running, or exits in another unexpected circumstance, these networks may get orphaned. This can potentially use up IP address space that is available to the Docker daemon. If this happens, you may see INTERNAL ENGINE ERROR code: 31 entries in your CPM logging when trying to create a new runner container. To clean these up in Docker container system environments only, run docker network prune. Security, sandboxing, and running as non-root By default, the software running inside a CPM is executed with root user privileges. This is suitable for most scenarios, as the execution is sandboxed. In a Docker container system environment: To change the default AppArmor profile used by containers that CPM spawns to run monitors, see the environment variable MINION_RUNNER_APPARMOR (CPM version 3.0.3 or higher) or MINION_DOCKER_RUNNER_APPARMOR (CPM version up to v3.0.2). To run the CPM as a non-root user, additional steps are required: Run as non-root user for Docker For more information, see Docker's official documentation about security and AppArmor security profiles. If your environment requires you to run the CPM as a non-root user, follow this procedure. In the following example, the non-root user is my_user. Ensure that my_user can use the Docker engine on the host: Verify that my_user belongs to the \"docker\" system group. OR Enable the Docker TCP socket option, and pass the DOCKER_HOST environment variable to CPM. Verify that my_user has read/write permissions to all the directories and volumes passed to CPM. To set these permission, use the chmod command. Get the uid of my_user for use in the run command: id -u my_user. Once these conditions are met, use the option \"-u <uid>:<gid>\" when launching CPM: docker run ... -u 1002 ... Copy OR docker run ... -u 1002 -e DOCKER_HOST=http://localhost:2375 ... Copy Docker image repository A single CPM Docker image serves both the Docker container system environment and Kubernetes container orchestration system environment. The Docker image is hosted on quay.io. To make sure your Docker image is up-to-date, see the quay.io newrelic/synthetics-minion repository. Additional considerations for CPM connection Connection Description CPMs without Internet access A CPM can operate without access to the internet, but with some exceptions. The public internet health check can be disabled using the environment variables named MINION_NETWORK_HEALTHCHECK_DISABLED for a Docker container system environment or synthetics.minionNetworkHealthCheckDisabled for a Kubernetes container orchestration system environment. The CPM needs to be able to contact the \"synthetics-horde.nr-data.net\" domain. This is necessary for it to report data to New Relic and to receive monitors to execute. Ask your network administration if this is a problem and how to set up exceptions. Communicate with Synthetics via a proxy To set up communication with New Relic by proxy, use the environment variables named MINION_API_PROXY*. Arguments passed at launch This applies to a Docker container environment only. Arguments passed to the CPM container at launch do not get passed on to the containers spawned by the CPM. Docker has no concept of \"inheritance\" or a \"hierarchy\" of containers, and we don't copy the configuration that is passed from CPM to the monitor-running containers. The only shared configuration between them is the one set at the Docker daemon level.",

      "body": "You can use New Relic's containerized private minions (CPM). These are Docker container-based private minions that accept and execute synthetic monitors against your private locations. The CPM can operate in a Docker container system environment or a Kubernetes container orchestration system environment. The CPM will auto-detect its environment to select the appropriate operating mode. General private minion features Because the CPM operates as a container instead of a virtual machine, it delivers many features: Easy to install, start, and update Runs on: Linux macOS Windows Enhanced security and support for non-root user execution Ability to leverage a Docker container as a sandbox environment Customizable monitor check timeout Custom provided modules for scripted monitor types Kubernetes-specific features Also, the CPM delivers the following features in a Kubernetes environment: Integrates with the Kubernetes API to delegate runtime lifecycle management to Kubernetes Does not require privileged access to the Docker socket Supports hosted and on-premise Kubernetes clusters Supports various container engines such as Docker and Containerd Deployable via Helm charts as well as configuration YAMLs Allows job (ping vs. non-ping checks) based resource allocation for optimum resource management Observability offered via the New Relic One Kubernetes cluster explorer System requirements and compatibility To host CPMs, your system must meet the minimum requirements for the chosen system environment. Caution Do not modify any CPM files. New Relic is not liable for any modifications you make. For more information, contact your account representative or a New Relic technical sales rep. Docker container system environment requirements Compatibility for Requirements Operating system Linux kernel: 3.10 or higher. macOS: 10.11 or higher. Windows: Windows 10 64-bit or higher. You must also configure Docker to run Linux containers in order for CPMs to work on Windows systems. Processor A modern, multi-core CPU Memory 2.5 GiB of RAM per CPU core (dedicated) Disk space A minimum of 10 GB per host Docker version Docker 17.12.1-ce or higher Private location key You must have a private location key Caution The Docker CPM is not designed for use with container orchestrators like AWS ECS, Docker Swarm, Apache Mesos, Azure Container Instances, etc. Running the Docker CPM in a container orchestrator will result in unexpected issues because it is itself a container orchestrator. If you're using container orchestration, see our Kubernetes CPM requirements. Kubernetes container orchestration system environment requirements (CPM v3.0.0 or higher) Compatibility for Requirements Operating system Linux kernel: 3.10 or higher macOS: 10.11 or higher Windows: Windows 10 64-bit or higher Processor A modern, multi-core CPU Minion pod CPU (vCPU/Core): 0.5 up to 0.75 Memory: 800 Mi up to 1.6 Gi Resources allocated to a Minion pod are user configurable. Runner pod CPU (vCPU/Core): 0.5 up to 1 Memory: 1.25 Gi up to 3 Gi For a scripted API check, 1.25 Gi will be requested with a limit of 2.5 Gi. For a simple browser or scripted browser check, 2 Gi will be requested with a limit of 3 Gi. Additional considerations: Resources allocated to a runner pod are not user configurable. The maximum limit-request resource ratio for both CPU and memory is 2. Disk space Persistent volume (PV) of at least 10 Gi in size Note that if a ReadWriteOnce (RWO) PV is provided to the minion, an implicit node affinity will be established to ensure the minion and the runner containers are scheduled on the same node. This is required to allow the minion and the associated runners access to the PV, as an RWO PV can be accessed only by a single node in the cluster. Kubernetes version We recommend that your Kubernetes cluster supports Kubernetes v1.15. Caution We have identified a compatibility issue with Kubernetes v1.21+. A workaround is available by disabling the BoundServiceAccountTokenVolume feature gate on the cluster. Private location key You must have a private location key Helm Follow installation instructions for Helm v3 for your OS. Kubectl Follow installation instructions for Kubectl for your OS. To view versions, dependencies, default values for how many runner pods start with each minion, the Persistent volume access mode, and more, please see Show help and examples below. Private location key Before launching CPMs, you must have a private location key. Your CPM uses the key to authenticate against New Relic and run monitors associated with that private location. To find the key for existing private location: Go to one.newrelic.com > Synthetics > Private locations. In the Private locations index, locate the private location you want your CPM to be assigned to. Note the key associated with the private location with the key icon. Sandboxing and Docker dependencies Sandboxing and Docker dependencies are applicable to the CPM in a Docker container system environment. Docker dependencies The CPM runs in Docker and is able to leverage Docker as a sandboxing technology. This ensures complete isolation of the monitor execution, which improves security, reliability, and repeatability. Every time a scripted or browser monitor is executed, the CPM creates a brand new Docker container to run it in called a runner. The minion container needs to be configured to communicate with the Docker engine in order to spawn additional runner containers. Each spawned container is then dedicated to run a check associated with the synthetic monitor running on the private location the minion container is associated with. There are two crucial dependencies at launch. To enable sandboxing, ensure that: Your writable and executable directory is mounted at /tmp. The writable directory can be any directory you want the CPM to write into, but New Relic recommends the system's own /tmp to make things easy. Your writable Docker UNIX socket is mounted at /var/run/docker.sock or DOCKER_HOST environment variable. For more information, see Docker's Daemon socket option. Caution Core count on the host determines how many runner containers the CPM can run concurrently on the host. Since memory requirements are scaled to the expected count of runner containers, we recommend not running multiple CPMs on the same host to avoid resource contention. For additional information on sandboxing and running as a root or non-root user, see Security, sandboxing, and running as non-root. Install and update CPM versions Both installing and updating the CPM use the same command to pull the latest Docker image from the Quay.io repository where the CPM Docker image is hosted. Go to quay.io/repository/newrelic/synthetics-minion for a list of all the releases. CPM images are also hosted on Docker Hub. Go to hub.docker.com/r/newrelic/synthetics-minion/tags for a list of all the releases. Unless hosting the images in a local image repository, connections to either quay.io or docker.io will need to be allowed through your firewall in order for Docker to pull the synthetics-minion and synthetics-minion-runner images. The \"runner\" image is pulled automatically on startup of the synthetics-minion container. See Docker environment configuration and Kubernetes environment configuration for details on how to set a local repository and the runner registry endpoint. Start the CPM To start the CPM, follow the applicable Docker or Kubernetes instructions. Docker start procedure Locate your private location key. Ensure you've enabled Docker dependencies for sandboxing and installed CPM on your system. Run the appropriate script for your system. Tailor the common defaults for /tmp and /var/run/docker.sock in the following examples to match your system. Linux/macOS: docker run \\ --name YOUR_CONTAINER_NAME \\ -e \"MINION_PRIVATE_LOCATION_KEY=YOUR_PRIVATE_LOCATION_KEY\" \\ -v /tmp:/tmp:rw \\ -v /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock:rw \\ -d \\ --restart unless-stopped \\ quay.io/newrelic/synthetics-minion:latest Copy Windows: docker run ^ --name YOUR_CONTAINER_NAME ^ -e \"MINION_PRIVATE_LOCATION_KEY=YOUR_PRIVATE_LOCATION_KEY\" ^ -v /tmp:/tmp:rw ^ -v /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock:rw ^ -d ^ --restart unless-stopped ^ quay.io/newrelic/synthetics-minion:latest Copy View the logs for your minion container: docker logs --follow YOUR_CONTAINER_NAME Copy When a message similar to Synthetics Minion is ready and servicing location YOUR_PRIVATE_LOCATION_LABEL appears, your CPM is up and ready to run monitors assigned to that location. Kubernetes start procedure Locate your private location key. Set up the a namespace for the CPM in your Kubernetes cluster: kubectl create namespace YOUR_NAMESPACE Copy Copy the Helm charts from the New Relic Helm repo. If you are copying the charts for the first time: helm repo add YOUR_REPO_NAME https://helm-charts.newrelic.com Copy If you previously copied the Helm charts from the New Relic Helm repo, then get the latest: helm repo update Copy Install the CPM with the following Helm command: For a fresh installation of the CPM: helm install YOUR_CPM_NAME YOUR_REPO_NAME/synthetics-minion -n YOUR_NAMESPACE --set synthetics.privateLocationKey=YOUR_PRIVATE_LOCATION_KEY Copy To update an existing CPM installation: helm upgrade YOUR_CPM_NAME YOUR_REPO_NAME/synthetics-minion -n YOUR_NAMESPACE --set synthetics.privateLocationKey=YOUR_PRIVATE_LOCATION_KEY Copy Check if the minion pod is up and running: kubectl get -n YOUR_NAMESPACE pods Copy Once the status attribute of each pod is shown as running, your CPM is up and ready to run monitors assigned to your private location. Stop or delete the CPM On a Docker container system environment, use the Docker stop procedure to stop the CPM from running. On a Kubernetes container orchestration system environment, use the Kubernetes delete procedure to stop the CPM from running. Docker stop procedure You can stop a Docker container either by the container name, or the container ID. Container name stop for Linux, macOS, and Windows: docker stop YOUR_CONTAINER_NAME docker rm YOUR_CONTAINER_NAME Copy Container ID stop for Linux/macOS: In the examples the container is stopped and removed. To only stop the container, omit docker rm $CONTAINER_ID. CONTAINER_ID=$(docker ps -aqf name=YOUR_CONTAINER_NAME) docker stop $CONTAINER_ID docker rm $CONTAINER_ID Copy Container ID stop for Windows: In the examples the container is stopped and removed. To only stop the container, omit docker rm $CONTAINER_ID. FOR /F \"tokens=*\" %%CID IN ('docker ps -aqf name=YOUR_CONTAINER_NAME') do (SET CONTAINER_ID=%%CID) docker stop %CONTAINER_ID% docker rm %CONTAINER_ID% Copy Kubernetes delete procedure Get the MINION_POD_INSTALLATION_NAME of the minion pod you want to delete: helm list -n YOUR_NAMESPACE Copy Delete the minion pod: helm uninstall -n YOUR_NAMESPACE MINION_POD_INSTALLATION_NAME Copy Delete the namespace set up for the CPM in your Kubernetes cluster: kubectl delete namespace YOUR_NAMESPACE Copy Show help and examples Use these options as applicable: To get a list of the most commonly used run options directly in the command line interface, run the show help command. To show CPM usage examples as well as the list of all the available run options, run this command: docker run quay.io/newrelic/synthetics-minion:latest help Copy To keep track of Docker logs and verify the health of your monitors, see Containerized private minion (CPM) maintenance and monitoring. For a CPM in the Kubernetes container orchestration system environment, the following Helm show commands can be used to view the chart.yaml and the values.yaml, respectively: helm show chart YOUR_REPO_NAME/synthetics-minion Copy helm show values YOUR_REPO_NAME/synthetics-minion Copy Show license information To show the licensing information for the open source software that we use in the CPM, run the LICENSE command. Run this command to view license information for CPM versions 2.2.27 or higher: docker run quay.io/newrelic/synthetics-minion:latest LICENSE Copy Some of our open-source software is listed under multiple software licenses, and in that case we have listed the license we've chosen to use. Our license information is also available in the our licenses documentation. Configure CPM You can configure the containerized private minion with custom npm modules, preserve data between launches, use environment variables, and more. For more information, see CPM configuration. Networks For both Docker and Kubernetes, the CPM and its runner containers will inherit network settings from the host. For an example of this on a Docker container system environment, see the Docker site. A new bridge network is created for each runner container. This means networking command options like --network and --dns passed to the CPM container at launch (such as through Docker run commands on a Docker container system environment) are not inherited or used by the runner containers. When these networks are created, they pull from the default IP address pool configured for daemon. For an example of this on a Docker container system environment, see the Docker site. Typically, the runner network is removed after the check is completed. However, if a CPM exits while a check is still running, or exits in another unexpected circumstance, these networks may get orphaned. This can potentially use up IP address space that is available to the Docker daemon. If this happens, you may see INTERNAL ENGINE ERROR code: 31 entries in your CPM logging when trying to create a new runner container. To clean these up in Docker container system environments only, run docker network prune. Security, sandboxing, and running as non-root By default, the software running inside a CPM is executed with root user privileges. This is suitable for most scenarios, as the execution is sandboxed. In a Docker container system environment: To change the default AppArmor profile used by containers that CPM spawns to run monitors, see the environment variable MINION_RUNNER_APPARMOR (CPM version 3.0.3 or higher) or MINION_DOCKER_RUNNER_APPARMOR (CPM version up to v3.0.2). To run the CPM as a non-root user, additional steps are required: Run as non-root user for Docker For more information, see Docker's official documentation about security and AppArmor security profiles. If your environment requires you to run the CPM as a non-root user, follow this procedure. In the following example, the non-root user is my_user. Ensure that my_user can use the Docker engine on the host: Verify that my_user belongs to the \"docker\" system group. OR Enable the Docker TCP socket option, and pass the DOCKER_HOST environment variable to CPM. Verify that my_user has read/write permissions to all the directories and volumes passed to CPM. To set these permission, use the chmod command. Get the uid of my_user for use in the run command: id -u my_user. Once these conditions are met, use the option \"-u <uid>:<gid>\" when launching CPM: docker run ... -u 1002 ... Copy OR docker run ... -u 1002 -e DOCKER_HOST=http://localhost:2375 ... Copy Docker image repository A single CPM Docker image serves both the Docker container system environment and Kubernetes container orchestration system environment. The Docker image is hosted on quay.io. To make sure your Docker image is up-to-date, see the quay.io newrelic/synthetics-minion repository. Additional considerations for CPM connection Connection Description CPMs without Internet access A CPM can operate without access to the internet, but with some exceptions. The public internet health check can be disabled using the environment variables named MINION_NETWORK_HEALTHCHECK_DISABLED for a Docker container system environment or synthetics.minionNetworkHealthCheckDisabled for a Kubernetes container orchestration system environment. The CPM needs to be able to contact the \"synthetics-horde.nr-data.net\" domain. This is necessary for it to report data to New Relic and to receive monitors to execute. Ask your network administration if this is a problem and how to set up exceptions. Communicate with Synthetics via a proxy To set up communication with New Relic by proxy, use the environment variables named MINION_API_PROXY*. Arguments passed at launch This applies to a Docker container environment only. Arguments passed to the CPM container at launch do not get passed on to the containers spawned by the CPM. Docker has no concept of \"inheritance\" or a \"hierarchy\" of containers, and we don't copy the configuration that is passed from CPM to the monitor-running containers. The only shared configuration between them is the one set at the Docker daemon level.",

Kubernetes container orchestration system environment requirements (CPM v3.0.0 or higher) Compatibility for Requirements Operating system Linux kernel: 3.10 or higher macOS: 10.11 or higher Windows: Windows 10 64-bit or higher Processor A modern, multi-core CPU Minion pod CPU (vCPU/Core): 0.5 up to 0.75 Memory: 800 Mi up to 1.6 Gi Resources allocated to a Minion pod are user configurable. Runner pod CPU (vCPU/Core): 0.5 up to 1 Memory: 1.25 Gi up to 3 Gi For a scripted API check, 1.25 Gi will be requested with a limit of 2.5 Gi. For a simple browser or scripted browser check, 2 Gi will be requested with a limit of 3 Gi. Additional considerations: Resources allocated to a runner pod are not user configurable. The maximum limit-request resource ratio for both CPU and memory is 2. Disk space Persistent volume (PV) of at least 10 Gi in size Note that if a ReadWriteOnce (RWO) PV is provided to the minion, an implicit node affinity will be established to ensure the minion and the runner containers are scheduled on the same node. This is required to allow the minion and the associated runners access to the PV, as an RWO PV can be accessed only by a single node in the cluster. Kubernetes version We recommend that your Kubernetes cluster supports Kubernetes v1.15. Caution We have identified a compatibility issue with Kubernetes v1.21+. A workaround is available by disabling the BoundServiceAccountTokenVolume feature gate on the cluster. Private location key You must have a private location key Helm Follow installation instructions for Helm v3 for your OS. Kubectl Follow installation instructions for Kubectl for your OS. To view versions, dependencies, default values for how many runner pods start with each minion, the Persistent volume access mode, and more, please see Show help and examples below. Private location key Before launching CPMs, you must have a private location key. Your CPM uses the key to authenticate against New Relic and run monitors associated with that private location. To find the key for existing private location: Go to one.newrelic.com > Synthetics > Private locations. In the Private locations index, locate the private location you want your CPM to be assigned to. Note the key associated with the private location with the key icon. Sandboxing and Docker dependencies Sandboxing and Docker dependencies are applicable to the CPM in a Docker container system environment. Docker dependencies The CPM runs in Docker and is able to leverage Docker as a sandboxing technology. This ensures complete isolation of the monitor execution, which improves security, reliability, and repeatability. Every time a scripted or browser monitor is executed, the CPM creates a brand new Docker container to run it in called a runner. The minion container needs to be configured to communicate with the Docker engine in order to spawn additional runner containers. Each spawned container is then dedicated to run a check associated with the synthetic monitor running on the private location the minion container is associated with. There are two crucial dependencies at launch. To enable sandboxing, ensure that: Your writable and executable directory is mounted at /tmp. The writable directory can be any directory you want the CPM to write into, but New Relic recommends the system's own /tmp to make things easy. Your writable Docker UNIX socket is mounted at /var/run/docker.sock or DOCKER_HOST environment variable. For more information, see Docker's Daemon socket option. Caution Core count on the host determines how many runner containers the CPM can run concurrently on the host. Since memory requirements are scaled to the expected count of runner containers, we recommend not running multiple CPMs on the same host to avoid resource contention. For additional information on sandboxing and running as a root or non-root user, see Security, sandboxing, and running as non-root. Install and update CPM versions Both installing and updating the CPM use the same command to pull the latest Docker image from the Quay.io repository where the CPM Docker image is hosted. Go to quay.io/repository/newrelic/synthetics-minion for a list of all the releases. CPM images are also hosted on Docker Hub. Go to hub.docker.com/r/newrelic/synthetics-minion/tags for a list of all the releases. Unless hosting the images in a local image repository, connections to either quay.io or docker.io will need to be allowed through your firewall in order for Docker to pull the synthetics-minion and synthetics-minion-runner images. The \"runner\" image is pulled automatically on startup of the synthetics-minion container. See Docker environment configuration and Kubernetes environment configuration for details on how to set a local repository and the runner registry endpoint. Start the CPM To start the CPM, follow the applicable Docker or Kubernetes instructions. Docker start procedure Locate your private location key. Ensure you've enabled Docker dependencies for sandboxing and installed CPM on your system. Run the appropriate script for your system. Tailor the common defaults for /tmp and /var/run/docker.sock in the following examples to match your system. Linux/macOS: docker run \\ --name YOUR_CONTAINER_NAME \\ -e \"MINION_PRIVATE_LOCATION_KEY=YOUR_PRIVATE_LOCATION_KEY\" \\ -v /tmp:/tmp:rw \\ -v /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock:rw \\ -d \\ --restart unless-stopped \\ quay.io/newrelic/synthetics-minion:latest Copy Windows: docker run ^ --name YOUR_CONTAINER_NAME ^ -e \"MINION_PRIVATE_LOCATION_KEY=YOUR_PRIVATE_LOCATION_KEY\" ^ -v /tmp:/tmp:rw ^ -v /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock:rw ^ -d ^ --restart unless-stopped ^ quay.io/newrelic/synthetics-minion:latest Copy View the logs for your minion container: docker logs --follow YOUR_CONTAINER_NAME Copy When a message similar to Synthetics Minion is ready and servicing location YOUR_PRIVATE_LOCATION_LABEL appears, your CPM is up and ready to run monitors assigned to that location. Kubernetes start procedure Locate your private location key. Set up the a namespace for the CPM in your Kubernetes cluster: kubectl create namespace YOUR_NAMESPACE Copy Copy the Helm charts from the New Relic Helm repo. If you are copying the charts for the first time: helm repo add YOUR_REPO_NAME https://helm-charts.newrelic.com Copy If you previously copied the Helm charts from the New Relic Helm repo, then get the latest: helm repo update Copy Install the CPM with the following Helm command: For a fresh installation of the CPM: helm install YOUR_CPM_NAME YOUR_REPO_NAME/synthetics-minion -n YOUR_NAMESPACE --set synthetics.privateLocationKey=YOUR_PRIVATE_LOCATION_KEY Copy To update an existing CPM installation: helm upgrade YOUR_CPM_NAME YOUR_REPO_NAME/synthetics-minion -n YOUR_NAMESPACE --set synthetics.privateLocationKey=YOUR_PRIVATE_LOCATION_KEY Copy Check if the minion pod is up and running: kubectl get -n YOUR_NAMESPACE pods Copy Once the status attribute of each pod is shown as running, your CPM is up and ready to run monitors assigned to your private location. Stop or delete the CPM On a Docker container system environment, use the Docker stop procedure to stop the CPM from running. On a Kubernetes container orchestration system environment, use the Kubernetes delete procedure to stop the CPM from running. Docker stop procedure You can stop a Docker container either by the container name, or the container ID. Container name stop for Linux, macOS, and Windows: docker stop YOUR_CONTAINER_NAME docker rm YOUR_CONTAINER_NAME Copy Container ID stop for Linux/macOS: In the examples the container is stopped and removed. To only stop the container, omit docker rm $CONTAINER_ID. CONTAINER_ID=$(docker ps -aqf name=YOUR_CONTAINER_NAME) docker stop $CONTAINER_ID docker rm $CONTAINER_ID Copy Container ID stop for Windows: In the examples the container is stopped and removed. To only stop the container, omit docker rm $CONTAINER_ID. FOR /F \"tokens=*\" %%CID IN ('docker ps -aqf name=YOUR_CONTAINER_NAME') do (SET CONTAINER_ID=%%CID) docker stop %CONTAINER_ID% docker rm %CONTAINER_ID% Copy Kubernetes delete procedure Get the MINION_POD_INSTALLATION_NAME of the minion pod you want to delete: helm list -n YOUR_NAMESPACE Copy Delete the minion pod: helm uninstall -n YOUR_NAMESPACE MINION_POD_INSTALLATION_NAME Copy Delete the namespace set up for the CPM in your Kubernetes cluster: kubectl delete namespace YOUR_NAMESPACE Copy Show help and examples Use these options as applicable: To get a list of the most commonly used run options directly in the command line interface, run the show help command. To show CPM usage examples as well as the list of all the available run options, run this command: docker run quay.io/newrelic/synthetics-minion:latest help Copy To keep track of Docker logs and verify the health of your monitors, see Containerized private minion (CPM) maintenance and monitoring. For a CPM in the Kubernetes container orchestration system environment, the following Helm show commands can be used to view the chart.yaml and the values.yaml, respectively: helm show chart YOUR_REPO_NAME/synthetics-minion Copy helm show values YOUR_REPO_NAME/synthetics-minion Copy Show license information To show the licensing information for the open source software that we use in the CPM, run the LICENSE command. Run this command to view license information for CPM versions 2.2.27 or higher: docker run quay.io/newrelic/synthetics-minion:latest LICENSE Copy Some of our open-source software is listed under multiple software licenses, and in that case we have listed the license we've chosen to use. Our license information is also available in the our licenses documentation. Configure CPM You can configure the containerized private minion with custom npm modules, preserve data between launches, use environment variables, and more. For more information, see CPM configuration. Networks For both Docker and Kubernetes, the CPM and its runner containers will inherit network settings from the host. For an example of this on a Docker container system environment, see the Docker site. A new bridge network is created for each runner container. This means networking command options like --network and --dns passed to the CPM container at launch (such as through Docker run commands on a Docker container system environment) are not inherited or used by the runner containers. When these networks are created, they pull from the default IP address pool configured for daemon. For an example of this on a Docker container system environment, see the Docker site. Typically, the runner network is removed after the check is completed. However, if a CPM exits while a check is still running, or exits in another unexpected circumstance, these networks may get orphaned. This can potentially use up IP address space that is available to the Docker daemon. If this happens, you may see INTERNAL ENGINE ERROR code: 31 entries in your CPM logging when trying to create a new runner container. To clean these up in Docker container system environments only, run docker network prune. Security, sandboxing, and running as non-root By default, the software running inside a CPM is executed with root user privileges. This is suitable for most scenarios, as the execution is sandboxed. In a Docker container system environment: To change the default AppArmor profile used by containers that CPM spawns to run monitors, see the environment variable MINION_RUNNER_APPARMOR (CPM version 3.0.3 or higher) or MINION_DOCKER_RUNNER_APPARMOR (CPM version up to v3.0.2). To run the CPM as a non-root user, additional steps are required: Run as non-root user for Docker For more information, see Docker's official documentation about security and AppArmor security profiles. If your environment requires you to run the CPM as a non-root user, follow this procedure. In the following example, the non-root user is my_user. Ensure that my_user can use the Docker engine on the host: Verify that my_user belongs to the \"docker\" system group. OR Enable the Docker TCP socket option, and pass the DOCKER_HOST environment variable to CPM. Verify that my_user has read/write permissions to all the directories and volumes passed to CPM. To set these permission, use the chmod command. Get the uid of my_user for use in the run command: id -u my_user. Once these conditions are met, use the option \"-u <uid>:<gid>\" when launching CPM: docker run ... -u 1002 ... Copy OR docker run ... -u 1002 -e DOCKER_HOST=http://localhost:2375 ... Copy Docker image repository A single CPM Docker image serves both the Docker container system environment and Kubernetes container orchestration system environment. The Docker image is hosted on quay.io. To make sure your Docker image is up-to-date, see the quay.io newrelic/synthetics-minion repository. Additional considerations for CPM connection Connection Description CPMs without Internet access A CPM can operate without access to the internet, but with some exceptions. The public internet health check can be disabled using the environment variables named MINION_NETWORK_HEALTHCHECK_DISABLED for a Docker container system environment or synthetics.minionNetworkHealthCheckDisabled for a Kubernetes container orchestration system environment. The CPM needs to be able to contact the \"synthetics-horde.nr-data.net\" domain. This is necessary for it to report data to New Relic and to receive monitors to execute. Ask your network administration if this is a problem and how to set up exceptions. Communicate with Synthetics via a proxy To set up communication with New Relic by proxy, use the environment variables named MINION_API_PROXY*. Arguments passed at launch This applies to a Docker container environment only. Arguments passed to the CPM container at launch do not get passed on to the containers spawned by the CPM. Docker has no concept of \"inheritance\" or a \"hierarchy\" of containers, and we don't copy the configuration that is passed from CPM to the monitor-running containers. The only shared configuration between them is the one set at the Docker daemon level.",

      "body": "You can use New Relic's containerized private minions (CPM). These are Docker container-based private minions that accept and execute synthetic monitors against your private locations. The CPM can operate in a Docker container system environment or a Kubernetes container orchestration system environment. The CPM will auto-detect its environment to select the appropriate operating mode. General private minion features Because the CPM operates as a container instead of a virtual machine, it delivers many features: Easy to install, start, and update Runs on: Linux macOS Windows Enhanced security and support for non-root user execution Ability to leverage a Docker container as a sandbox environment Customizable monitor check timeout Custom provided modules for scripted monitor types Kubernetes-specific features Also, the CPM delivers the following features in a Kubernetes environment: Integrates with the Kubernetes API to delegate runtime lifecycle management to Kubernetes Does not require privileged access to the Docker socket Supports hosted and on-premise Kubernetes clusters Supports various container engines such as Docker and Containerd Deployable via Helm charts as well as configuration YAMLs Allows job (ping vs. non-ping checks) based resource allocation for optimum resource management Observability offered via the New Relic One Kubernetes cluster explorer System requirements and compatibility To host CPMs, your system must meet the minimum requirements for the chosen system environment. Caution Do not modify any CPM files. New Relic is not liable for any modifications you make. For more information, contact your account representative or a New Relic technical sales rep. Docker container system environment requirements Compatibility for Requirements Operating system Linux kernel: 3.10 or higher. macOS: 10.11 or higher. Windows: Windows 10 64-bit or higher. You must also configure Docker to run Linux containers in order for CPMs to work on Windows systems. Processor A modern, multi-core CPU Memory 2.5 GiB of RAM per CPU core (dedicated) Disk space A minimum of 10 GB per host Docker version Docker 17.12.1-ce or higher Private location key You must have a private location key Caution The Docker CPM is not designed for use with container orchestrators like AWS ECS, Docker Swarm, Apache Mesos, Azure Container Instances, etc. Running the Docker CPM in a container orchestrator will result in unexpected issues because it is itself a container orchestrator. If you're using container orchestration, see our Kubernetes CPM requirements.

Runner pod CPU (vCPU/Core): 0.5 up to 1 Memory: 1.25 Gi up to 3 Gi For a scripted API check, 1.25 Gi will be requested with a limit of 2.5 Gi. For a simple browser or scripted browser check, 2 Gi will be requested with a limit of 3 Gi. Additional considerations: Resources allocated to a runner pod are not user configurable. The maximum limit-request resource ratio for both CPU and memory is 2. Disk space Persistent volume (PV) of at least 10 Gi in size Note that if a ReadWriteOnce (RWO) PV is provided to the minion, an implicit node affinity will be established to ensure the minion and the runner containers are scheduled on the same node. This is required to allow the minion and the associated runners access to the PV, as an RWO PV can be accessed only by a single node in the cluster. Kubernetes version We recommend that your Kubernetes cluster supports Kubernetes v1.15. Caution We have identified a compatibility issue with Kubernetes v1.21+. A workaround is available by disabling the BoundServiceAccountTokenVolume feature gate on the cluster. Private location key You must have a private location key Helm Follow installation instructions for Helm v3 for your OS. Kubectl Follow installation instructions for Kubectl for your OS. To view versions, dependencies, default values for how many runner pods start with each minion, the Persistent volume access mode, and more, please see Show help and examples below. Private location key Before launching CPMs, you must have a private location key. Your CPM uses the key to authenticate against New Relic and run monitors associated with that private location. To find the key for existing private location: Go to one.newrelic.com > Synthetics > Private locations. In the Private locations index, locate the private location you want your CPM to be assigned to. Note the key associated with the private location with the key icon. Sandboxing and Docker dependencies Sandboxing and Docker dependencies are applicable to the CPM in a Docker container system environment. Docker dependencies The CPM runs in Docker and is able to leverage Docker as a sandboxing technology. This ensures complete isolation of the monitor execution, which improves security, reliability, and repeatability. Every time a scripted or browser monitor is executed, the CPM creates a brand new Docker container to run it in called a runner. The minion container needs to be configured to communicate with the Docker engine in order to spawn additional runner containers. Each spawned container is then dedicated to run a check associated with the synthetic monitor running on the private location the minion container is associated with. There are two crucial dependencies at launch. To enable sandboxing, ensure that: Your writable and executable directory is mounted at /tmp. The writable directory can be any directory you want the CPM to write into, but New Relic recommends the system's own /tmp to make things easy. Your writable Docker UNIX socket is mounted at /var/run/docker.sock or DOCKER_HOST environment variable. For more information, see Docker's Daemon socket option. Caution Core count on the host determines how many runner containers the CPM can run concurrently on the host. Since memory requirements are scaled to the expected count of runner containers, we recommend not running multiple CPMs on the same host to avoid resource contention. For additional information on sandboxing and running as a root or non-root user, see Security, sandboxing, and running as non-root. Install and update CPM versions Both installing and updating the CPM use the same command to pull the latest Docker image from the Quay.io repository where the CPM Docker image is hosted. Go to quay.io/repository/newrelic/synthetics-minion for a list of all the releases. CPM images are also hosted on Docker Hub. Go to hub.docker.com/r/newrelic/synthetics-minion/tags for a list of all the releases. Unless hosting the images in a local image repository, connections to either quay.io or docker.io will need to be allowed through your firewall in order for Docker to pull the synthetics-minion and synthetics-minion-runner images. The \"runner\" image is pulled automatically on startup of the synthetics-minion container. See Docker environment configuration and Kubernetes environment configuration for details on how to set a local repository and the runner registry endpoint. Start the CPM To start the CPM, follow the applicable Docker or Kubernetes instructions. Docker start procedure Locate your private location key. Ensure you've enabled Docker dependencies for sandboxing and installed CPM on your system. Run the appropriate script for your system. Tailor the common defaults for /tmp and /var/run/docker.sock in the following examples to match your system. Linux/macOS: docker run \\ --name YOUR_CONTAINER_NAME \\ -e \"MINION_PRIVATE_LOCATION_KEY=YOUR_PRIVATE_LOCATION_KEY\" \\ -v /tmp:/tmp:rw \\ -v /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock:rw \\ -d \\ --restart unless-stopped \\ quay.io/newrelic/synthetics-minion:latest Copy Windows: docker run ^ --name YOUR_CONTAINER_NAME ^ -e \"MINION_PRIVATE_LOCATION_KEY=YOUR_PRIVATE_LOCATION_KEY\" ^ -v /tmp:/tmp:rw ^ -v /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock:rw ^ -d ^ --restart unless-stopped ^ quay.io/newrelic/synthetics-minion:latest Copy View the logs for your minion container: docker logs --follow YOUR_CONTAINER_NAME Copy When a message similar to Synthetics Minion is ready and servicing location YOUR_PRIVATE_LOCATION_LABEL appears, your CPM is up and ready to run monitors assigned to that location. Kubernetes start procedure Locate your private location key. Set up the a namespace for the CPM in your Kubernetes cluster: kubectl create namespace YOUR_NAMESPACE Copy Copy the Helm charts from the New Relic Helm repo. If you are copying the charts for the first time: helm repo add YOUR_REPO_NAME https://helm-charts.newrelic.com Copy If you previously copied the Helm charts from the New Relic Helm repo, then get the latest: helm repo update Copy Install the CPM with the following Helm command: For a fresh installation of the CPM: helm install YOUR_CPM_NAME YOUR_REPO_NAME/synthetics-minion -n YOUR_NAMESPACE --set synthetics.privateLocationKey=YOUR_PRIVATE_LOCATION_KEY Copy To update an existing CPM installation: helm upgrade YOUR_CPM_NAME YOUR_REPO_NAME/synthetics-minion -n YOUR_NAMESPACE --set synthetics.privateLocationKey=YOUR_PRIVATE_LOCATION_KEY Copy Check if the minion pod is up and running: kubectl get -n YOUR_NAMESPACE pods Copy Once the status attribute of each pod is shown as running, your CPM is up and ready to run monitors assigned to your private location. Stop or delete the CPM On a Docker container system environment, use the Docker stop procedure to stop the CPM from running. On a Kubernetes container orchestration system environment, use the Kubernetes delete procedure to stop the CPM from running. Docker stop procedure You can stop a Docker container either by the container name, or the container ID. Container name stop for Linux, macOS, and Windows: docker stop YOUR_CONTAINER_NAME docker rm YOUR_CONTAINER_NAME Copy Container ID stop for Linux/macOS: In the examples the container is stopped and removed. To only stop the container, omit docker rm $CONTAINER_ID. CONTAINER_ID=$(docker ps -aqf name=YOUR_CONTAINER_NAME) docker stop $CONTAINER_ID docker rm $CONTAINER_ID Copy Container ID stop for Windows: In the examples the container is stopped and removed. To only stop the container, omit docker rm $CONTAINER_ID. FOR /F \"tokens=*\" %%CID IN ('docker ps -aqf name=YOUR_CONTAINER_NAME') do (SET CONTAINER_ID=%%CID) docker stop %CONTAINER_ID% docker rm %CONTAINER_ID% Copy Kubernetes delete procedure Get the MINION_POD_INSTALLATION_NAME of the minion pod you want to delete: helm list -n YOUR_NAMESPACE Copy Delete the minion pod: helm uninstall -n YOUR_NAMESPACE MINION_POD_INSTALLATION_NAME Copy Delete the namespace set up for the CPM in your Kubernetes cluster: kubectl delete namespace YOUR_NAMESPACE Copy Show help and examples Use these options as applicable: To get a list of the most commonly used run options directly in the command line interface, run the show help command. To show CPM usage examples as well as the list of all the available run options, run this command: docker run quay.io/newrelic/synthetics-minion:latest help Copy To keep track of Docker logs and verify the health of your monitors, see Containerized private minion (CPM) maintenance and monitoring. For a CPM in the Kubernetes container orchestration system environment, the following Helm show commands can be used to view the chart.yaml and the values.yaml, respectively: helm show chart YOUR_REPO_NAME/synthetics-minion Copy helm show values YOUR_REPO_NAME/synthetics-minion Copy Show license information To show the licensing information for the open source software that we use in the CPM, run the LICENSE command. Run this command to view license information for CPM versions 2.2.27 or higher: docker run quay.io/newrelic/synthetics-minion:latest LICENSE Copy Some of our open-source software is listed under multiple software licenses, and in that case we have listed the license we've chosen to use. Our license information is also available in the our licenses documentation. Configure CPM You can configure the containerized private minion with custom npm modules, preserve data between launches, use environment variables, and more. For more information, see CPM configuration. Networks For both Docker and Kubernetes, the CPM and its runner containers will inherit network settings from the host. For an example of this on a Docker container system environment, see the Docker site. A new bridge network is created for each runner container. This means networking command options like --network and --dns passed to the CPM container at launch (such as through Docker run commands on a Docker container system environment) are not inherited or used by the runner containers. When these networks are created, they pull from the default IP address pool configured for daemon. For an example of this on a Docker container system environment, see the Docker site. Typically, the runner network is removed after the check is completed. However, if a CPM exits while a check is still running, or exits in another unexpected circumstance, these networks may get orphaned. This can potentially use up IP address space that is available to the Docker daemon. If this happens, you may see INTERNAL ENGINE ERROR code: 31 entries in your CPM logging when trying to create a new runner container. To clean these up in Docker container system environments only, run docker network prune. Security, sandboxing, and running as non-root By default, the software running inside a CPM is executed with root user privileges. This is suitable for most scenarios, as the execution is sandboxed. In a Docker container system environment: To change the default AppArmor profile used by containers that CPM spawns to run monitors, see the environment variable MINION_RUNNER_APPARMOR (CPM version 3.0.3 or higher) or MINION_DOCKER_RUNNER_APPARMOR (CPM version up to v3.0.2). To run the CPM as a non-root user, additional steps are required: Run as non-root user for Docker For more information, see Docker's official documentation about security and AppArmor security profiles. If your environment requires you to run the CPM as a non-root user, follow this procedure. In the following example, the non-root user is my_user. Ensure that my_user can use the Docker engine on the host: Verify that my_user belongs to the \"docker\" system group. OR Enable the Docker TCP socket option, and pass the DOCKER_HOST environment variable to CPM. Verify that my_user has read/write permissions to all the directories and volumes passed to CPM. To set these permission, use the chmod command. Get the uid of my_user for use in the run command: id -u my_user. Once these conditions are met, use the option \"-u <uid>:<gid>\" when launching CPM: docker run ... -u 1002 ... Copy OR docker run ... -u 1002 -e DOCKER_HOST=http://localhost:2375 ... Copy Docker image repository A single CPM Docker image serves both the Docker container system environment and Kubernetes container orchestration system environment. The Docker image is hosted on quay.io. To make sure your Docker image is up-to-date, see the quay.io newrelic/synthetics-minion repository. Additional considerations for CPM connection Connection Description CPMs without Internet access A CPM can operate without access to the internet, but with some exceptions. The public internet health check can be disabled using the environment variables named MINION_NETWORK_HEALTHCHECK_DISABLED for a Docker container system environment or synthetics.minionNetworkHealthCheckDisabled for a Kubernetes container orchestration system environment. The CPM needs to be able to contact the \"synthetics-horde.nr-data.net\" domain. This is necessary for it to report data to New Relic and to receive monitors to execute. Ask your network administration if this is a problem and how to set up exceptions. Communicate with Synthetics via a proxy To set up communication with New Relic by proxy, use the environment variables named MINION_API_PROXY*. Arguments passed at launch This applies to a Docker container environment only. Arguments passed to the CPM container at launch do not get passed on to the containers spawned by the CPM. Docker has no concept of \"inheritance\" or a \"hierarchy\" of containers, and we don't copy the configuration that is passed from CPM to the monitor-running containers. The only shared configuration between them is the one set at the Docker daemon level.",

      "body": "You can use New Relic's containerized private minions (CPM). These are Docker container-based private minions that accept and execute synthetic monitors against your private locations. The CPM can operate in a Docker container system environment or a Kubernetes container orchestration system environment. The CPM will auto-detect its environment to select the appropriate operating mode. General private minion features Because the CPM operates as a container instead of a virtual machine, it delivers many features: Easy to install, start, and update Runs on: Linux macOS Windows Enhanced security and support for non-root user execution Ability to leverage a Docker container as a sandbox environment Customizable monitor check timeout Custom provided modules for scripted monitor types Kubernetes-specific features Also, the CPM delivers the following features in a Kubernetes environment: Integrates with the Kubernetes API to delegate runtime lifecycle management to Kubernetes Does not require privileged access to the Docker socket Supports hosted and on-premise Kubernetes clusters Supports various container engines such as Docker and Containerd Deployable via Helm charts as well as configuration YAMLs Allows job (ping vs. non-ping checks) based resource allocation for optimum resource management Observability offered via the New Relic One Kubernetes cluster explorer System requirements and compatibility To host CPMs, your system must meet the minimum requirements for the chosen system environment. Caution Do not modify any CPM files. New Relic is not liable for any modifications you make. For more information, contact your account representative or a New Relic technical sales rep. Docker container system environment requirements Compatibility for Requirements Operating system Linux kernel: 3.10 or higher. macOS: 10.11 or higher. Windows: Windows 10 64-bit or higher. You must also configure Docker to run Linux containers in order for CPMs to work on Windows systems. Processor A modern, multi-core CPU Memory 2.5 GiB of RAM per CPU core (dedicated) Disk space A minimum of 10 GB per host Docker version Docker 17.12.1-ce or higher Private location key You must have a private location key Caution The Docker CPM is not designed for use with container orchestrators like AWS ECS, Docker Swarm, Apache Mesos, Azure Container Instances, etc. Running the Docker CPM in a container orchestrator will result in unexpected issues because it is itself a container orchestrator. If you're using container orchestration, see our Kubernetes CPM requirements. Kubernetes container orchestration system environment requirements (CPM v3.0.0 or higher) Compatibility for Requirements Operating system Linux kernel: 3.10 or higher macOS: 10.11 or higher Windows: Windows 10 64-bit or higher Processor A modern, multi-core CPU Minion pod CPU (vCPU/Core): 0.5 up to 0.75 Memory: 800 Mi up to 1.6 Gi Resources allocated to a Minion pod are user configurable. Runner pod CPU (vCPU/Core): 0.5 up to 1 Memory: 1.25 Gi up to 3 Gi For a scripted API check, 1.25 Gi will be requested with a limit of 2.5 Gi. For a simple browser or scripted browser check, 2 Gi will be requested with a limit of 3 Gi. Additional considerations: Resources allocated to a runner pod are not user configurable. The maximum limit-request resource ratio for both CPU and memory is 2. Disk space Persistent volume (PV) of at least 10 Gi in size Note that if a ReadWriteOnce (RWO) PV is provided to the minion, an implicit node affinity will be established to ensure the minion and the runner containers are scheduled on the same node. This is required to allow the minion and the associated runners access to the PV, as an RWO PV can be accessed only by a single node in the cluster. Kubernetes version We recommend that your Kubernetes cluster supports Kubernetes v1.15. Caution We have identified a compatibility issue with Kubernetes v1.21+. A workaround is available by disabling the BoundServiceAccountTokenVolume feature gate on the cluster. Private location key You must have a private location key Helm Follow installation instructions for Helm v3 for your OS. Kubectl Follow installation instructions for Kubectl for your OS. To view versions, dependencies, default values for how many runner pods start with each minion, the Persistent volume access mode, and more, please see Show help and examples below. Private location key Before launching CPMs, you must have a private location key. Your CPM uses the key to authenticate against New Relic and run monitors associated with that private location. To find the key for existing private location: Go to one.newrelic.com > Synthetics > Private locations. In the Private locations index, locate the private location you want your CPM to be assigned to. Note the key associated with the private location with the key icon. Sandboxing and Docker dependencies Sandboxing and Docker dependencies are applicable to the CPM in a Docker container system environment. Docker dependencies The CPM runs in Docker and is able to leverage Docker as a sandboxing technology. This ensures complete isolation of the monitor execution, which improves security, reliability, and repeatability. Every time a scripted or browser monitor is executed, the CPM creates a brand new Docker container to run it in called a runner. The minion container needs to be configured to communicate with the Docker engine in order to spawn additional runner containers. Each spawned container is then dedicated to run a check associated with the synthetic monitor running on the private location the minion container is associated with. There are two crucial dependencies at launch. To enable sandboxing, ensure that: Your writable and executable directory is mounted at /tmp. The writable directory can be any directory you want the CPM to write into, but New Relic recommends the system's own /tmp to make things easy. Your writable Docker UNIX socket is mounted at /var/run/docker.sock or DOCKER_HOST environment variable. For more information, see Docker's Daemon socket option. Caution Core count on the host determines how many runner containers the CPM can run concurrently on the host. Since memory requirements are scaled to the expected count of runner containers, we recommend not running multiple CPMs on the same host to avoid resource contention. For additional information on sandboxing and running as a root or non-root user, see Security, sandboxing, and running as non-root. Install and update CPM versions Both installing and updating the CPM use the same command to pull the latest Docker image from the Quay.io repository where the CPM Docker image is hosted. Go to quay.io/repository/newrelic/synthetics-minion for a list of all the releases. CPM images are also hosted on Docker Hub. Go to hub.docker.com/r/newrelic/synthetics-minion/tags for a list of all the releases. Unless hosting the images in a local image repository, connections to either quay.io or docker.io will need to be allowed through your firewall in order for Docker to pull the synthetics-minion and synthetics-minion-runner images. The \"runner\" image is pulled automatically on startup of the synthetics-minion container. See Docker environment configuration and Kubernetes environment configuration for details on how to set a local repository and the runner registry endpoint. Start the CPM To start the CPM, follow the applicable Docker or Kubernetes instructions. Docker start procedure Locate your private location key. Ensure you've enabled Docker dependencies for sandboxing and installed CPM on your system. Run the appropriate script for your system. Tailor the common defaults for /tmp and /var/run/docker.sock in the following examples to match your system. Linux/macOS: docker run \\ --name YOUR_CONTAINER_NAME \\ -e \"MINION_PRIVATE_LOCATION_KEY=YOUR_PRIVATE_LOCATION_KEY\" \\ -v /tmp:/tmp:rw \\ -v /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock:rw \\ -d \\ --restart unless-stopped \\ quay.io/newrelic/synthetics-minion:latest Copy Windows: docker run ^ --name YOUR_CONTAINER_NAME ^ -e \"MINION_PRIVATE_LOCATION_KEY=YOUR_PRIVATE_LOCATION_KEY\" ^ -v /tmp:/tmp:rw ^ -v /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock:rw ^ -d ^ --restart unless-stopped ^ quay.io/newrelic/synthetics-minion:latest Copy View the logs for your minion container: docker logs --follow YOUR_CONTAINER_NAME Copy When a message similar to Synthetics Minion is ready and servicing location YOUR_PRIVATE_LOCATION_LABEL appears, your CPM is up and ready to run monitors assigned to that location. Kubernetes start procedure Locate your private location key. Set up the a namespace for the CPM in your Kubernetes cluster: kubectl create namespace YOUR_NAMESPACE Copy Copy the Helm charts from the New Relic Helm repo. If you are copying the charts for the first time: helm repo add YOUR_REPO_NAME https://helm-charts.newrelic.com Copy If you previously copied the Helm charts from the New Relic Helm repo, then get the latest: helm repo update Copy Install the CPM with the following Helm command: For a fresh installation of the CPM: helm install YOUR_CPM_NAME YOUR_REPO_NAME/synthetics-minion -n YOUR_NAMESPACE --set synthetics.privateLocationKey=YOUR_PRIVATE_LOCATION_KEY Copy To update an existing CPM installation: helm upgrade YOUR_CPM_NAME YOUR_REPO_NAME/synthetics-minion -n YOUR_NAMESPACE --set synthetics.privateLocationKey=YOUR_PRIVATE_LOCATION_KEY Copy Check if the minion pod is up and running: kubectl get -n YOUR_NAMESPACE pods Copy Once the status attribute of each pod is shown as running, your CPM is up and ready to run monitors assigned to your private location. Stop or delete the CPM On a Docker container system environment, use the Docker stop procedure to stop the CPM from running. On a Kubernetes container orchestration system environment, use the Kubernetes delete procedure to stop the CPM from running. Docker stop procedure You can stop a Docker container either by the container name, or the container ID. Container name stop for Linux, macOS, and Windows: docker stop YOUR_CONTAINER_NAME docker rm YOUR_CONTAINER_NAME Copy Container ID stop for Linux/macOS: In the examples the container is stopped and removed. To only stop the container, omit docker rm $CONTAINER_ID. CONTAINER_ID=$(docker ps -aqf name=YOUR_CONTAINER_NAME) docker stop $CONTAINER_ID docker rm $CONTAINER_ID Copy Container ID stop for Windows: In the examples the container is stopped and removed. To only stop the container, omit docker rm $CONTAINER_ID. FOR /F \"tokens=*\" %%CID IN ('docker ps -aqf name=YOUR_CONTAINER_NAME') do (SET CONTAINER_ID=%%CID) docker stop %CONTAINER_ID% docker rm %CONTAINER_ID% Copy Kubernetes delete procedure Get the MINION_POD_INSTALLATION_NAME of the minion pod you want to delete: helm list -n YOUR_NAMESPACE Copy Delete the minion pod: helm uninstall -n YOUR_NAMESPACE MINION_POD_INSTALLATION_NAME Copy Delete the namespace set up for the CPM in your Kubernetes cluster: kubectl delete namespace YOUR_NAMESPACE Copy Show help and examples Use these options as applicable: To get a list of the most commonly used run options directly in the command line interface, run the show help command. To show CPM usage examples as well as the list of all the available run options, run this command: docker run quay.io/newrelic/synthetics-minion:latest help Copy To keep track of Docker logs and verify the health of your monitors, see Containerized private minion (CPM) maintenance and monitoring. For a CPM in the Kubernetes container orchestration system environment, the following Helm show commands can be used to view the chart.yaml and the values.yaml, respectively: helm show chart YOUR_REPO_NAME/synthetics-minion Copy helm show values YOUR_REPO_NAME/synthetics-minion Copy Show license information To show the licensing information for the open source software that we use in the CPM, run the LICENSE command. Run this command to view license information for CPM versions 2.2.27 or higher: docker run quay.io/newrelic/synthetics-minion:latest LICENSE Copy Some of our open-source software is listed under multiple software licenses, and in that case we have listed the license we've chosen to use. Our license information is also available in the our licenses documentation. Configure CPM You can configure the containerized private minion with custom npm modules, preserve data between launches, use environment variables, and more. For more information, see CPM configuration. Networks For both Docker and Kubernetes, the CPM and its runner containers will inherit network settings from the host. For an example of this on a Docker container system environment, see the Docker site. A new bridge network is created for each runner container. This means networking command options like --network and --dns passed to the CPM container at launch (such as through Docker run commands on a Docker container system environment) are not inherited or used by the runner containers. When these networks are created, they pull from the default IP address pool configured for daemon. For an example of this on a Docker container system environment, see the Docker site. Typically, the runner network is removed after the check is completed. However, if a CPM exits while a check is still running, or exits in another unexpected circumstance, these networks may get orphaned. This can potentially use up IP address space that is available to the Docker daemon. If this happens, you may see INTERNAL ENGINE ERROR code: 31 entries in your CPM logging when trying to create a new runner container. To clean these up in Docker container system environments only, run docker network prune. Security, sandboxing, and running as non-root By default, the software running inside a CPM is executed with root user privileges. This is suitable for most scenarios, as the execution is sandboxed. In a Docker container system environment: To change the default AppArmor profile used by containers that CPM spawns to run monitors, see the environment variable MINION_RUNNER_APPARMOR (CPM version 3.0.3 or higher) or MINION_DOCKER_RUNNER_APPARMOR (CPM version up to v3.0.2). To run the CPM as a non-root user, additional steps are required: Run as non-root user for Docker For more information, see Docker's official documentation about security and AppArmor security profiles. If your environment requires you to run the CPM as a non-root user, follow this procedure. In the following example, the non-root user is my_user. Ensure that my_user can use the Docker engine on the host: Verify that my_user belongs to the \"docker\" system group. OR Enable the Docker TCP socket option, and pass the DOCKER_HOST environment variable to CPM. Verify that my_user has read/write permissions to all the directories and volumes passed to CPM. To set these permission, use the chmod command. Get the uid of my_user for use in the run command: id -u my_user. Once these conditions are met, use the option \"-u <uid>:<gid>\" when launching CPM: docker run ... -u 1002 ... Copy OR docker run ... -u 1002 -e DOCKER_HOST=http://localhost:2375 ... Copy Docker image repository A single CPM Docker image serves both the Docker container system environment and Kubernetes container orchestration system environment. The Docker image is hosted on quay.io. To make sure your Docker image is up-to-date, see the quay.io newrelic/synthetics-minion repository. Additional considerations for CPM connection Connection Description CPMs without Internet access A CPM can operate without access to the internet, but with some exceptions. The public internet health check can be disabled using the environment variables named MINION_NETWORK_HEALTHCHECK_DISABLED for a Docker container system environment or synthetics.minionNetworkHealthCheckDisabled for a Kubernetes container orchestration system environment. The CPM needs to be able to contact the \"synthetics-horde.nr-data.net\" domain. This is necessary for it to report data to New Relic and to receive monitors to execute. Ask your network administration if this is a problem and how to set up exceptions. Communicate with Synthetics via a proxy To set up communication with New Relic by proxy, use the environment variables named MINION_API_PROXY*. Arguments passed at launch This applies to a Docker container environment only. Arguments passed to the CPM container at launch do not get passed on to the containers spawned by the CPM. Docker has no concept of \"inheritance\" or a \"hierarchy\" of containers, and we don't copy the configuration that is passed from CPM to the monitor-running containers. The only shared configuration between them is the one set at the Docker daemon level.",

      "body": "Synthetic monitoring regularly checks your websites, critical business transactions, and API endpoints to measure optimal performance. Browser monitoring tracks the actual results of webpage performance across all variations of devices, browsers, and connection speeds. Used together, they provide a direct page load time comparison between real user (browser) interactions and the synthetic monitors. Compare performance and trends New Relic's comparative charting feature helps operations managers and teams by providing: Benchmarks for page load times Additional insights to help you plan where to optimize your site Comparisons of synthetic trends vs. actual browser performance without needing to switch between our monitoring capabilities. For example, during a page outage, you can compare synthetic monitoring trends to actual browser monitoring comparisons to see if an issue is also visible in Synthetics UI, or if it is caused by variables outside of New Relic. This helps you more efficiently know where to take action. What you need The comparative charting feature requires: Browser monitoring enabled with the browser SPA agent (version 885 or higher). A synthetic browser or scripted monitor with one or more tests on the same URLs monitored by the browser agent. After you enable the comparative charting feature either from synthetic or from browser monitoring, no additional setup is required. The comparative charting feature will appear when New Relic finds matching URLs. Enable comparison data After you enable the comparative charting feature from either synthetic or browser monitoring, no additional setup is required. The comparative charting feature will appear whenever synthetics or browser monitoring finds matching URLs. Enable comparative charting from Synthetics UI To enable the comparative charting feature from Synthetics UI: Go to one.newrelic.com > Synthetics > (select a monitor) > Summary. Above the selected monitor's Availability chart, select the ellipsis icon. Select Enable Synthetics comparison. Enable comparative charting from browser monitoring UI To enable the comparison data feature from browser monitoring: Go to one.newrelic.com > Browser > (select a browser app) > Page views. Select a page monitored by synthetic monitoring. From the selected page's Performance tab, select the ellipsis icon. Select Enable Synthetics comparison. View comparison data The comparative charting feature appears whenever synthetic monitoring identifies a URL match with browser monitoring and can compare it. You can compare browser and synthetic's performance either from the synthetic monitoring Summary page or from the browser monitoring Page views page (for browser apps or single page apps) without needing to switch between New Relic capabilities. Based on the selected data sources, the summary shows: Overall speed percentage comparison between browser (real user) page views and any matching URLs found in synthetic monitors that the user has permissions to view Number of URLs found in synthetic monitors that match the browser rollup URL To view the comparative charting summary: From synthetic monitoring UI: Go to one.newrelic.com > Synthetics > (select a monitor) > Summary. OR From browser monitoring UI: Go to one.newrelic.com > Browser > (select a browser app) > Page views, then select a page monitored by synthetic monitoring. Review the comparative charting feature's summary of overall speed percentage and number of matching URLs. To view additional details, select the summary's right arrow icon. Please note that in some cases the simple browser monitor ends before the browser agent has had a chance to collect the BrowserInteraction event. In this case, no comparative charting data is displayed in the UI. In order to resolve this issue, create a scripted browser monitor instead, and add a call to wait (sleep) after the page is loaded. Here is an example: $browser.get('https://www.mywebsite.com').then(function(){ return $browser.sleep(1000); }) Copy Hide or return comparison data To hide the comparative charting feature, select the ellipsis icon. To keep it visible but move it away from the top of the page, select Move to bottom. To return it to its original place on the page, select Move to top. To remove it from the page, select Hide all Synthetics/Browser comparisons. To return it to the page after removing it, follow standard procedures to enable comparison charting. Data sources New Relic uses these data sources for the synthetics and browser comparison in the UI. For deeper analysis of the comparative chart data you see in the UI, use the query builder to run NRQL queries. Variable Description Monitor account ID The account from which you are running the monitor: SELECT monitorAccountId FROM BrowserInteraction Copy Monitor ID The unique ID assigned to your synthetic monitor: SELECT monitorId FROM BrowserInteraction Copy Monitor job ID The ID of a single synthetics monitor run, which began at a specific time and originated from a specific location: SELECT monitorJobId FROM BrowserInteraction LIMIT 1 Copy Real user average The average page load time for real users viewing your website (excludes synthetic monitors).

      "body": "You can use New Relic's containerized private minions (CPM). These are Docker container-based private minions that accept and execute synthetic monitors against your private locations. The CPM can operate in a Docker container system environment or a Kubernetes container orchestration system environment. The CPM will auto-detect its environment to select the appropriate operating mode. General private minion features Because the CPM operates as a container instead of a virtual machine, it delivers many features: Easy to install, start, and update Runs on: Linux macOS Windows Enhanced security and support for non-root user execution Ability to leverage a Docker container as a sandbox environment Customizable monitor check timeout Custom provided modules for scripted monitor types Kubernetes-specific features Also, the CPM delivers the following features in a Kubernetes environment: Integrates with the Kubernetes API to delegate runtime lifecycle management to Kubernetes Does not require privileged access to the Docker socket Supports hosted and on-premise Kubernetes clusters Supports various container engines such as Docker and Containerd Deployable via Helm charts as well as configuration YAMLs Allows job (ping vs. non-ping checks) based resource allocation for optimum resource management Observability offered via the New Relic One Kubernetes cluster explorer System requirements and compatibility To host CPMs, your system must meet the minimum requirements for the chosen system environment. Caution Do not modify any CPM files. New Relic is not liable for any modifications you make. For more information, contact your account representative or a New Relic technical sales rep. Docker container system environment requirements Compatibility for Requirements Operating system Linux kernel: 3.10 or higher. macOS: 10.11 or higher. Windows: Windows 10 64-bit or higher. You must also configure Docker to run Linux containers in order for CPMs to work on Windows systems. Processor A modern, multi-core CPU Memory 2.5 GiB of RAM per CPU core (dedicated) Disk space A minimum of 10 GB per host Docker version Docker 17.12.1-ce or higher Private location key You must have a private location key Caution The Docker CPM is not designed for use with container orchestrators like AWS ECS, Docker Swarm, Apache Mesos, Azure Container Instances, etc. Running the Docker CPM in a container orchestrator will result in unexpected issues because it is itself a container orchestrator. If you're using container orchestration, see our Kubernetes CPM requirements. Kubernetes container orchestration system environment requirements (CPM v3.0.0 or higher) Compatibility for Requirements Operating system Linux kernel: 3.10 or higher macOS: 10.11 or higher Windows: Windows 10 64-bit or higher Processor A modern, multi-core CPU Minion pod CPU (vCPU/Core): 0.5 up to 0.75 Memory: 800 Mi up to 1.6 Gi Resources allocated to a Minion pod are user configurable. Runner pod CPU (vCPU/Core): 0.5 up to 1 Memory: 1.25 Gi up to 3 Gi For a scripted API check, 1.25 Gi will be requested with a limit of 2.5 Gi. For a simple browser or scripted browser check, 2 Gi will be requested with a limit of 3 Gi. Additional considerations: Resources allocated to a runner pod are not user configurable. The maximum limit-request resource ratio for both CPU and memory is 2. Disk space Persistent volume (PV) of at least 10 Gi in size Note that if a ReadWriteOnce (RWO) PV is provided to the minion, an implicit node affinity will be established to ensure the minion and the runner containers are scheduled on the same node. This is required to allow the minion and the associated runners access to the PV, as an RWO PV can be accessed only by a single node in the cluster. Kubernetes version We recommend that your Kubernetes cluster supports Kubernetes v1.15. Caution We have identified a compatibility issue with Kubernetes v1.21+. A workaround is available by disabling the BoundServiceAccountTokenVolume feature gate on the cluster. Private location key You must have a private location key Helm Follow installation instructions for Helm v3 for your OS. Kubectl Follow installation instructions for Kubectl for your OS. To view versions, dependencies, default values for how many runner pods start with each minion, the Persistent volume access mode, and more, please see Show help and examples below. Private location key Before launching CPMs, you must have a private location key. Your CPM uses the key to authenticate against New Relic and run monitors associated with that private location. To find the key for existing private location: Go to one.newrelic.com > Synthetics > Private locations. In the Private locations index, locate the private location you want your CPM to be assigned to. Note the key associated with the private location with the key icon. Sandboxing and Docker dependencies Sandboxing and Docker dependencies are applicable to the CPM in a Docker container system environment. Docker dependencies The CPM runs in Docker and is able to leverage Docker as a sandboxing technology. This ensures complete isolation of the monitor execution, which improves security, reliability, and repeatability. Every time a scripted or browser monitor is executed, the CPM creates a brand new Docker container to run it in called a runner. The minion container needs to be configured to communicate with the Docker engine in order to spawn additional runner containers. Each spawned container is then dedicated to run a check associated with the synthetic monitor running on the private location the minion container is associated with. There are two crucial dependencies at launch. To enable sandboxing, ensure that: Your writable and executable directory is mounted at /tmp. The writable directory can be any directory you want the CPM to write into, but New Relic recommends the system's own /tmp to make things easy. Your writable Docker UNIX socket is mounted at /var/run/docker.sock or DOCKER_HOST environment variable. For more information, see Docker's Daemon socket option. Caution Core count on the host determines how many runner containers the CPM can run concurrently on the host. Since memory requirements are scaled to the expected count of runner containers, we recommend not running multiple CPMs on the same host to avoid resource contention. For additional information on sandboxing and running as a root or non-root user, see Security, sandboxing, and running as non-root. Install and update CPM versions Both installing and updating the CPM use the same command to pull the latest Docker image from the Quay.io repository where the CPM Docker image is hosted. Go to quay.io/repository/newrelic/synthetics-minion for a list of all the releases. CPM images are also hosted on Docker Hub. Go to hub.docker.com/r/newrelic/synthetics-minion/tags for a list of all the releases. Unless hosting the images in a local image repository, connections to either quay.io or docker.io will need to be allowed through your firewall in order for Docker to pull the synthetics-minion and synthetics-minion-runner images. The \"runner\" image is pulled automatically on startup of the synthetics-minion container. See Docker environment configuration and Kubernetes environment configuration for details on how to set a local repository and the runner registry endpoint. Start the CPM To start the CPM, follow the applicable Docker or Kubernetes instructions. Docker start procedure Locate your private location key. Ensure you've enabled Docker dependencies for sandboxing and installed CPM on your system. Run the appropriate script for your system. Tailor the common defaults for /tmp and /var/run/docker.sock in the following examples to match your system. Linux/macOS: docker run \\ --name YOUR_CONTAINER_NAME \\ -e \"MINION_PRIVATE_LOCATION_KEY=YOUR_PRIVATE_LOCATION_KEY\" \\ -v /tmp:/tmp:rw \\ -v /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock:rw \\ -d \\ --restart unless-stopped \\ quay.io/newrelic/synthetics-minion:latest Copy Windows: docker run ^ --name YOUR_CONTAINER_NAME ^ -e \"MINION_PRIVATE_LOCATION_KEY=YOUR_PRIVATE_LOCATION_KEY\" ^ -v /tmp:/tmp:rw ^ -v /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock:rw ^ -d ^ --restart unless-stopped ^ quay.io/newrelic/synthetics-minion:latest Copy View the logs for your minion container: docker logs --follow YOUR_CONTAINER_NAME Copy When a message similar to Synthetics Minion is ready and servicing location YOUR_PRIVATE_LOCATION_LABEL appears, your CPM is up and ready to run monitors assigned to that location. Kubernetes start procedure Locate your private location key. Set up the a namespace for the CPM in your Kubernetes cluster: kubectl create namespace YOUR_NAMESPACE Copy Copy the Helm charts from the New Relic Helm repo. If you are copying the charts for the first time: helm repo add YOUR_REPO_NAME https://helm-charts.newrelic.com Copy If you previously copied the Helm charts from the New Relic Helm repo, then get the latest: helm repo update Copy Install the CPM with the following Helm command: For a fresh installation of the CPM: helm install YOUR_CPM_NAME YOUR_REPO_NAME/synthetics-minion -n YOUR_NAMESPACE --set synthetics.privateLocationKey=YOUR_PRIVATE_LOCATION_KEY Copy To update an existing CPM installation: helm upgrade YOUR_CPM_NAME YOUR_REPO_NAME/synthetics-minion -n YOUR_NAMESPACE --set synthetics.privateLocationKey=YOUR_PRIVATE_LOCATION_KEY Copy Check if the minion pod is up and running: kubectl get -n YOUR_NAMESPACE pods Copy Once the status attribute of each pod is shown as running, your CPM is up and ready to run monitors assigned to your private location. Stop or delete the CPM On a Docker container system environment, use the Docker stop procedure to stop the CPM from running. On a Kubernetes container orchestration system environment, use the Kubernetes delete procedure to stop the CPM from running. Docker stop procedure You can stop a Docker container either by the container name, or the container ID. Container name stop for Linux, macOS, and Windows: docker stop YOUR_CONTAINER_NAME docker rm YOUR_CONTAINER_NAME Copy Container ID stop for Linux/macOS: In the examples the container is stopped and removed. To only stop the container, omit docker rm $CONTAINER_ID. CONTAINER_ID=$(docker ps -aqf name=YOUR_CONTAINER_NAME) docker stop $CONTAINER_ID docker rm $CONTAINER_ID Copy Container ID stop for Windows: In the examples the container is stopped and removed. To only stop the container, omit docker rm $CONTAINER_ID. FOR /F \"tokens=*\" %%CID IN ('docker ps -aqf name=YOUR_CONTAINER_NAME') do (SET CONTAINER_ID=%%CID) docker stop %CONTAINER_ID% docker rm %CONTAINER_ID% Copy Kubernetes delete procedure Get the MINION_POD_INSTALLATION_NAME of the minion pod you want to delete: helm list -n YOUR_NAMESPACE Copy Delete the minion pod: helm uninstall -n YOUR_NAMESPACE MINION_POD_INSTALLATION_NAME Copy Delete the namespace set up for the CPM in your Kubernetes cluster: kubectl delete namespace YOUR_NAMESPACE Copy Show help and examples Use these options as applicable: To get a list of the most commonly used run options directly in the command line interface, run the show help command. To show CPM usage examples as well as the list of all the available run options, run this command: docker run quay.io/newrelic/synthetics-minion:latest help Copy To keep track of Docker logs and verify the health of your monitors, see Containerized private minion (CPM) maintenance and monitoring. For a CPM in the Kubernetes container orchestration system environment, the following Helm show commands can be used to view the chart.yaml and the values.yaml, respectively: helm show chart YOUR_REPO_NAME/synthetics-minion Copy helm show values YOUR_REPO_NAME/synthetics-minion Copy Show license information To show the licensing information for the open source software that we use in the CPM, run the LICENSE command. Run this command to view license information for CPM versions 2.2.27 or higher: docker run quay.io/newrelic/synthetics-minion:latest LICENSE Copy Some of our open-source software is listed under multiple software licenses, and in that case we have listed the license we've chosen to use. Our license information is also available in the our licenses documentation. Configure CPM You can configure the containerized private minion with custom npm modules, preserve data between launches, use environment variables, and more. For more information, see CPM configuration. Networks For both Docker and Kubernetes, the CPM and its runner containers will inherit network settings from the host. For an example of this on a Docker container system environment, see the Docker site. A new bridge network is created for each runner container. This means networking command options like --network and --dns passed to the CPM container at launch (such as through Docker run commands on a Docker container system environment) are not inherited or used by the runner containers. When these networks are created, they pull from the default IP address pool configured for daemon. For an example of this on a Docker container system environment, see the Docker site. Typically, the runner network is removed after the check is completed. However, if a CPM exits while a check is still running, or exits in another unexpected circumstance, these networks may get orphaned. This can potentially use up IP address space that is available to the Docker daemon. If this happens, you may see INTERNAL ENGINE ERROR code: 31 entries in your CPM logging when trying to create a new runner container. To clean these up in Docker container system environments only, run docker network prune. Security, sandboxing, and running as non-root By default, the software running inside a CPM is executed with root user privileges. This is suitable for most scenarios, as the execution is sandboxed. In a Docker container system environment: To change the default AppArmor profile used by containers that CPM spawns to run monitors, see the environment variable MINION_RUNNER_APPARMOR (CPM version 3.0.3 or higher) or MINION_DOCKER_RUNNER_APPARMOR (CPM version up to v3.0.2). To run the CPM as a non-root user, additional steps are required: Run as non-root user for Docker For more information, see Docker's official documentation about security and AppArmor security profiles. If your environment requires you to run the CPM as a non-root user, follow this procedure. In the following example, the non-root user is my_user. Ensure that my_user can use the Docker engine on the host: Verify that my_user belongs to the \"docker\" system group. OR Enable the Docker TCP socket option, and pass the DOCKER_HOST environment variable to CPM. Verify that my_user has read/write permissions to all the directories and volumes passed to CPM. To set these permission, use the chmod command. Get the uid of my_user for use in the run command: id -u my_user. Once these conditions are met, use the option \"-u <uid>:<gid>\" when launching CPM: docker run ... -u 1002 ... Copy OR docker run ... -u 1002 -e DOCKER_HOST=http://localhost:2375 ... Copy Docker image repository A single CPM Docker image serves both the Docker container system environment and Kubernetes container orchestration system environment. The Docker image is hosted on quay.io. To make sure your Docker image is up-to-date, see the quay.io newrelic/synthetics-minion repository. Additional considerations for CPM connection Connection Description CPMs without Internet access A CPM can operate without access to the internet, but with some exceptions. The public internet health check can be disabled using the environment variables named MINION_NETWORK_HEALTHCHECK_DISABLED for a Docker container system environment or synthetics.minionNetworkHealthCheckDisabled for a Kubernetes container orchestration system environment. The CPM needs to be able to contact the \"synthetics-horde.nr-data.net\" domain. This is necessary for it to report data to New Relic and to receive monitors to execute. Ask your network administration if this is a problem and how to set up exceptions. Communicate with Synthetics via a proxy To set up communication with New Relic by proxy, use the environment variables named MINION_API_PROXY*. Arguments passed at launch This applies to a Docker container environment only. Arguments passed to the CPM container at launch do not get passed on to the containers spawned by the CPM. Docker has no concept of \"inheritance\" or a \"hierarchy\" of containers, and we don't copy the configuration that is passed from CPM to the monitor-running containers. The only shared configuration between them is the one set at the Docker daemon level.",

      "body": "Synthetic monitoring regularly checks your websites, critical business transactions, and API endpoints to measure optimal performance. Browser monitoring tracks the actual results of webpage performance across all variations of devices, browsers, and connection speeds. Used together, they provide a direct page load time comparison between real user (browser) interactions and the synthetic monitors. Compare performance and trends New Relic's comparative charting feature helps operations managers and teams by providing: Benchmarks for page load times Additional insights to help you plan where to optimize your site Comparisons of synthetic trends vs. actual browser performance without needing to switch between our monitoring capabilities. For example, during a page outage, you can compare synthetic monitoring trends to actual browser monitoring comparisons to see if an issue is also visible in Synthetics UI, or if it is caused by variables outside of New Relic. This helps you more efficiently know where to take action. What you need The comparative charting feature requires: Browser monitoring enabled with the browser SPA agent (version 885 or higher). A synthetic browser or scripted monitor with one or more tests on the same URLs monitored by the browser agent. After you enable the comparative charting feature either from synthetic or from browser monitoring, no additional setup is required. The comparative charting feature will appear when New Relic finds matching URLs. Enable comparison data After you enable the comparative charting feature from either synthetic or browser monitoring, no additional setup is required. The comparative charting feature will appear whenever synthetics or browser monitoring finds matching URLs. Enable comparative charting from Synthetics UI To enable the comparative charting feature from Synthetics UI: Go to one.newrelic.com > Synthetics > (select a monitor) > Summary. Above the selected monitor's Availability chart, select the ellipsis icon. Select Enable Synthetics comparison. Enable comparative charting from browser monitoring UI To enable the comparison data feature from browser monitoring: Go to one.newrelic.com > Browser > (select a browser app) > Page views. Select a page monitored by synthetic monitoring. From the selected page's Performance tab, select the ellipsis icon. Select Enable Synthetics comparison. View comparison data The comparative charting feature appears whenever synthetic monitoring identifies a URL match with browser monitoring and can compare it. You can compare browser and synthetic's performance either from the synthetic monitoring Summary page or from the browser monitoring Page views page (for browser apps or single page apps) without needing to switch between New Relic capabilities. Based on the selected data sources, the summary shows: Overall speed percentage comparison between browser (real user) page views and any matching URLs found in synthetic monitors that the user has permissions to view Number of URLs found in synthetic monitors that match the browser rollup URL To view the comparative charting summary: From synthetic monitoring UI: Go to one.newrelic.com > Synthetics > (select a monitor) > Summary. OR From browser monitoring UI: Go to one.newrelic.com > Browser > (select a browser app) > Page views, then select a page monitored by synthetic monitoring. Review the comparative charting feature's summary of overall speed percentage and number of matching URLs. To view additional details, select the summary's right arrow icon. Please note that in some cases the simple browser monitor ends before the browser agent has had a chance to collect the BrowserInteraction event. In this case, no comparative charting data is displayed in the UI. In order to resolve this issue, create a scripted browser monitor instead, and add a call to wait (sleep) after the page is loaded. Here is an example: $browser.get('https://www.mywebsite.com').then(function(){ return $browser.sleep(1000); }) Copy Hide or return comparison data To hide the comparative charting feature, select the ellipsis icon. To keep it visible but move it away from the top of the page, select Move to bottom. To return it to its original place on the page, select Move to top. To remove it from the page, select Hide all Synthetics/Browser comparisons. To return it to the page after removing it, follow standard procedures to enable comparison charting. Data sources New Relic uses these data sources for the synthetics and browser comparison in the UI. For deeper analysis of the comparative chart data you see in the UI, use the query builder to run NRQL queries. Variable Description Monitor account ID The account from which you are running the monitor: SELECT monitorAccountId FROM BrowserInteraction Copy Monitor ID The unique ID assigned to your synthetic monitor: SELECT monitorId FROM BrowserInteraction Copy Monitor job ID The ID of a single synthetics monitor run, which began at a specific time and originated from a specific location: SELECT monitorJobId FROM BrowserInteraction LIMIT 1 Copy Real user average The average page load time for real users viewing your website (excludes synthetic monitors).

Use the Synthetics REST API to manage monitors. Set up monitors from specific locations or for private servers. You can also use the host not reporting feature in infrastructure monitoring. This allows you to take advantage of enhanced monitoring options and be notified when New Relic has stopped receiving data from your hosts. Types of monitors These are the seven types of synthetic monitors: Type of synthetic monitor Description Broken links monitor API name: SCRIPT_API Provide a url and this monitor will test all the links on the page for success. If a failure is detected you can view the individual non-successful links that caused the failure. Certificate check monitor API name: SCRIPT_API Proactively ping your domain certificates based on a configurable threshold. Pair with an alert to ensure you are notified when your certificates need renewed. Ping monitor API name: SIMPLE Ping monitors are the simplest type of monitor. They simply check to see if an application is online. The synthetic ping monitor uses a simple Java HTTP client to make requests to your site. For consistency with other synthetic monitor types, the user agent is identified as Google Chrome. However, the HTTP client is not a full browser, and it does not execute JavaScript. If you need JavaScript functionality, use a simple browser monitor. Step monitor API name: STEP_MONITOR Step monitors are advanced monitors which require no code to set up. The monitor can be configured to: Assert modal Assert text Assert title Assert an element Click an element Dismiss a modal Double click an element Enter a secure credential Hover over an element Locate an element by CSS class, HTML ID, link text, Xpath, or value Navigate to a URL Select from a dropdown Type text Simple browser monitors API name: BROWSER Simple browser monitors essentially are simple, pre-built scripted browser monitors. They make a request to your site using an instance of Google Chrome. Compared to a simple ping monitor, this is a more accurate emulation of an actual customer visit. The user agent is identified as Google Chrome. Scripted browser monitors API name: SCRIPT_BROWSER Scripted browser monitors are used for more sophisticated, customized monitoring. You can create a custom script that navigates your website, takes specific actions, and ensures specific resources are present. The monitor uses Google Chrome browser. You can also use a variety of third-party modules to build your custom monitor. API tests API name: SCRIPT_API API tests are used to monitor your API endpoints. This can ensure that your app server works in addition to your website. New Relic uses the http-request module internally to make HTTP calls to your endpoint and validate the results.",

For an explanation of user models and how they relate to our pricing models, see Overview of pricing and user changes. Users on original user model For users on our original user model, access will vary depending on whether you have default roles or custom roles: Default access Admins have full access to all synthetic monitoring features on an account. Users have access to all synthetic monitoring features except secure credentials and the ability to delete monitors, monitor downtime, and private locations. Restricted Users on accounts with original product-based pricing have view-only access to all synthetic monitoring features except: Secure credentials Private locations (although they can query a limited amount of data via NRQL) This means that users with this role do not have access to all create, edit, and delete capabilities for synthetic monitoring features (as well as view capability for secure credentials) until they are given a role with the appropriate capabilities. Customize access To get started, follow standard procedures to create a custom role. You can add View and Edit capabilities to any role for the following: Monitors Monitor scripts Private locations Monitor downtimes Secure credentials Users on New Relic One user model For users on the New Relic One user model, full platform users have the ability to use the synthetic monitoring UI to create and manage synthetic monitors, while basic users cannot do that.

      "body": "Synthetic monitoring is a suite of automated, scriptable tools to monitor your websites, critical business transactions, and API endpoints. You can simulate user traffic to proactively detect and resolve outages and poor performance of critical endpoints before your customers notice. Why it matters With synthetic monitoring, you can: Get the context of failures by connecting the availability and performance of endpoints to the underlying applications and infrastructure. Easily diagnose if an issue stems from the network or AWS location, a slow third party resource, or the health of backend services or infrastructure. Add synthetic monitoring into build automation and CI/CD pipelines to automatically track performance and check functionality for each deployment. Expand your monitoring further with real, Selenium-powered scripted browsers, which test login procedures, searches, and other critical business transactions. Monitor your API endpoints with API tests. Ready to get started? If you don't already have one, sign up for a New Relic account. It's free, forever! Advanced testing Synthetic monitoring allows you to proactively monitor your website or API endpoint to ensure your content is not only available, but fully functional. Synthetic monitoring browser tests send real, Selenium-powered Google Chrome browsers to your site from locations around the world to ensure your content is always up, everywhere. Scripted browsers expand your testing capabilities, so you can test uncommon user flows or beta-test complex procedures. For example, ensure your users are able to sign up for your newsletter, add an item to their cart, or search for and find a piece of critical content with a simple JavaScript-like language. Test your backend with API monitors, which allow you to run scripted tests against any API endpoint. Enhanced monitoring and reporting Synthetic monitoring aggregates the results of each check into metrics, allowing you to see patterns and identify causes of poor performance. Synthetic monitoring also stores each and every monitor result, so you can see exactly where your website broke down. Alerts notify you if your website or API endpoint is inaccessible. You can even expand your geographical coverage or monitor internal websites by creating private locations. You can also query your monitor results for a closer look. New Relic retains monitor results for thirteen months, ensuring you can compare usage year over year. Additional features Synthetic monitoring includes the following features: Feature Description Real browsers With simple browser and scripted browser monitors, synthetic monitoring doesn't simply check that your host is up. It loads the actual page content in a real, fully virtualized Google Chrome browser (powered by Selenium) to provide testing that mirrors your users' actions. Detailed results view Synthetic monitoring stores every single run of your monitor for 13 months, so you can view a detailed breakdown of each and every check. You can get a snapshot of your website's performance and availability, or hunt down specific problems. Comparative charts with browser monitoring Use New Relic's comparative charting feature for a direct page load time comparison between real user (browser monitoring) interactions and the synthetic monitors. For example, during a page outage, you can compare trends to see if an issue is also visible in synthetic monitoring, or if it is caused by other variables. Advanced scripted monitoring Use scripted browsers to run complex test cases against your website. Ensure critical processes like checkout and login are always running smoothly, and build a baseline to compare against when things go wrong. With a built-in scripting IDE based on Node.js, create scripts quickly without leaving your browser. Global test coverage Check coverage from locations around the world to ensure your users can access your website from anywhere, anytime. Monitor sites behind your firewall by adding the synthetic monitoring static IP addresses to your allow list. Use private locations to monitor internal sites or to expand your coverage to new locations. Compatibility with popular analytics platforms Synthetic monitoring specifically excludes scripts for popular analytics services, like Google Analytics. This ensures your analytics tools continue to receive the exact same data, even with thousands of monitors checking your website each month. You can unblock any of the services blocked by default, or block additional services. REST API functions Synthetic monitoring includes a REST API, which you can use to manage: Simple monitors and scripted monitors Categories and labels for monitors Alert notifications Data protection and privacy The data from synthetic monitoring is test data, representing typical interaction with the webpage or application. It is never actual data from human beings. The data collected when you use synthetic monitoring therefore is not personal data. For more information, see the Synthetic monitoring security documentation. Compatibility and requirements Synthetic monitoring does not require any software except a supported browser. Important To monitor a site behind your firewall, add the synthetic monitoring public minion IP addresses to your allow list. Permissions By default, all users in your account can: View synthetic monitoring pages. Add, edit, and delete monitors. For more fine-grained control, you can enable the optional permissions system. The permissions system allows you to manage the level of access for users to view and edit within synthetic monitoring (for example, monitors and private locations).",

Capability Integration Browser monitoring The Ruby agent automatically injects the browser JavaScript agent when you enable auto-instrumentation. After enabling browser injection, you can view browser data in the APM Summary page and quickly switch between the APM and browser data for a particular app. For configuration options and manual instrumentation, see the browser and Ruby agent documentation. Infrastructure monitoring When you install the Infrastructure and APM agents on the same host, they automatically detect one another. You can then view a list of hosts in the APM UI, and filter your Infrastructure hosts by APM app in the Infrastructure UI. For more information, see APM data in infrastructure monitoring.

Use the Synthetics REST API to manage monitors. Set up monitors from specific locations or for private servers. You can also use the host not reporting feature in infrastructure monitoring. This allows you to take advantage of enhanced monitoring options and be notified when New Relic has stopped receiving data from your hosts. Types of monitors These are the seven types of synthetic monitors: Type of synthetic monitor Description Broken links monitor API name: SCRIPT_API Provide a url and this monitor will test all the links on the page for success. If a failure is detected you can view the individual non-successful links that caused the failure. Certificate check monitor API name: SCRIPT_API Proactively ping your domain certificates based on a configurable threshold. Pair with an alert to ensure you are notified when your certificates need renewed. Ping monitor API name: SIMPLE Ping monitors are the simplest type of monitor. They simply check to see if an application is online. The synthetic ping monitor uses a simple Java HTTP client to make requests to your site. For consistency with other synthetic monitor types, the user agent is identified as Google Chrome. However, the HTTP client is not a full browser, and it does not execute JavaScript. If you need JavaScript functionality, use a simple browser monitor. Step monitor API name: STEP_MONITOR Step monitors are advanced monitors which require no code to set up. The monitor can be configured to: Assert modal Assert text Assert title Assert an element Click an element Dismiss a modal Double click an element Enter a secure credential Hover over an element Locate an element by CSS class, HTML ID, link text, Xpath, or value Navigate to a URL Select from a dropdown Type text Simple browser monitors API name: BROWSER Simple browser monitors essentially are simple, pre-built scripted browser monitors. They make a request to your site using an instance of Google Chrome. Compared to a simple ping monitor, this is a more accurate emulation of an actual customer visit. The user agent is identified as Google Chrome. Scripted browser monitors API name: SCRIPT_BROWSER Scripted browser monitors are used for more sophisticated, customized monitoring. You can create a custom script that navigates your website, takes specific actions, and ensures specific resources are present. The monitor uses Google Chrome browser. You can also use a variety of third-party modules to build your custom monitor. API tests API name: SCRIPT_API API tests are used to monitor your API endpoints. This can ensure that your app server works in addition to your website. New Relic uses the http-request module internally to make HTTP calls to your endpoint and validate the results.",

Capability Integration Browser monitoring The Ruby agent automatically injects the browser JavaScript agent when you enable auto-instrumentation. After enabling browser injection, you can view browser data in the APM Summary page and quickly switch between the APM and browser data for a particular app. For configuration options and manual instrumentation, see the browser and Ruby agent documentation. Infrastructure monitoring When you install the Infrastructure and APM agents on the same host, they automatically detect one another. You can then view a list of hosts in the APM UI, and filter your Infrastructure hosts by APM app in the Infrastructure UI. For more information, see APM data in infrastructure monitoring.

Use the resources load time, time spent by third parties, and irregular response codes graphs for a high-level overview, and use the resources list to identify high-impact resources such as large CSS files or images. You can also investigate a specific resource with detailed resource metrics, which aggregate performance information for a single resource.

Understand resource metrics Use the Resources page to understand the performance impact of each resource on your website: Resources list: Lists the resources on your monitored website by average download time. Use this list to optimize your website's performance by reducing download times. You can also view the load time for any particular resource by searching for it in the Search all resources field. Select a resource to view individual resource metrics. Load time: Graphs the average load time for all resources, broken down by resource type (such as jpeg, json, or javascript). Use this graph to understand how the load time of your website changes over time. Time spent by third parties: Graphs the average load time of all third-party resources, such as web fonts, an embedded Twitter timeline, or an externally hosted image. Use this graph to see if third-party websites are affecting your website's performance. Irregular response codes: Graphs the number of negative HTTP response codes (also called HTTP status codes) received by the monitor. This graph includes all responses in the 300 (redirection), 400 (client error), and 500 (server error) ranges. It does not count responses in the 100 or 200 ranges. Synthetics also collects a number of custom response codes. By analyzing these metrics, you can track down troublesome resources and improve their performance. For example, an unoptimized logo image might cause slowdowns for every visitor of your site, while a tracker that is served only from a US-based server could result in slow performance for non-US visitors. View detailed resource metrics You can also view detailed metrics for each resource on your site. To view detailed metrics, locate a specific resource, or simply select an interesting resource from the Resources page. After selecting a resource, you can view overview metrics for that resource, or view an individual resource load: Max duration, Min duration, Avg duration: Load time metrics for this resource over the selected time frame. For 50% of requests: The maximum download time for the fastest 50% of requests. This means that 50% of requests for this resource were completed in the specified time or faster. For 95% of requests: The maximum download time for the fastest 95% of requests. This means that 95% of requests for this resource were completed in the specified time or faster. Average load time: Graphs the average load time for this resource over the selected time frame. Use this graph to verify that optimizations to your website (such as decreasing the size of an image or minifying your CSS) are working. You can also hide and unhide chart elements, filter by location, and sort the resource results list by Download time or DNS lookup. Mouse over the resource name to view the full path (useful with very long dynamically generated resource names). View individual resource loads After viewing detailed metrics for a particular resource, you can select an individual resource load for an in-depth understanding of one poor performance incident.

      "body": "Use the Resources page to understand the load time impact of each resource on your website. Use the resources load time, time spent by third parties, and irregular response codes graphs for a high-level overview, and use the resources list to identify high-impact resources such as large CSS files or images. You can also investigate a specific resource with detailed resource metrics, which aggregate performance information for a single resource. Go even deeper and view one load of that resource, using the exact request and response headers to pinpoint a performance issue. View the Resources page To access your monitor's Resources page: Go to one.newrelic.com > Synthetics > (select a monitor) > Resources. one.newrelic.com > Synthetics > (select a monitor) > Resources: Use the Resources page to analyze the performance of each resource on your website, and to access detailed metrics with individual resource loads. Understand resource metrics Use the Resources page to understand the performance impact of each resource on your website: Resources list: Lists the resources on your monitored website by average download time. Use this list to optimize your website's performance by reducing download times. You can also view the load time for any particular resource by searching for it in the Search all resources field. Select a resource to view individual resource metrics. Load time: Graphs the average load time for all resources, broken down by resource type (such as jpeg, json, or javascript). Use this graph to understand how the load time of your website changes over time. Time spent by third parties: Graphs the average load time of all third-party resources, such as web fonts, an embedded Twitter timeline, or an externally hosted image. Use this graph to see if third-party websites are affecting your website's performance. Irregular response codes: Graphs the number of negative HTTP response codes (also called HTTP status codes) received by the monitor. This graph includes all responses in the 300 (redirection), 400 (client error), and 500 (server error) ranges. It does not count responses in the 100 or 200 ranges. Synthetics also collects a number of custom response codes. By analyzing these metrics, you can track down troublesome resources and improve their performance. For example, an unoptimized logo image might cause slowdowns for every visitor of your site, while a tracker that is served only from a US-based server could result in slow performance for non-US visitors. View detailed resource metrics You can also view detailed metrics for each resource on your site. To view detailed metrics, locate a specific resource, or simply select an interesting resource from the Resources page. After selecting a resource, you can view overview metrics for that resource, or view an individual resource load: Max duration, Min duration, Avg duration: Load time metrics for this resource over the selected time frame. For 50% of requests: The maximum download time for the fastest 50% of requests. This means that 50% of requests for this resource were completed in the specified time or faster. For 95% of requests: The maximum download time for the fastest 95% of requests. This means that 95% of requests for this resource were completed in the specified time or faster. Average load time: Graphs the average load time for this resource over the selected time frame. Use this graph to verify that optimizations to your website (such as decreasing the size of an image or minifying your CSS) are working. You can also hide and unhide chart elements, filter by location, and sort the resource results list by Download time or DNS lookup. Mouse over the resource name to view the full path (useful with very long dynamically generated resource names). View individual resource loads After viewing detailed metrics for a particular resource, you can select an individual resource load for an in-depth understanding of one poor performance incident. You can then view a breakdown of the total connection time to understand where the issue occurred, and examine request and response headers. one.newrelic.com > Synthetics > (select a monitor) > Resources > (select a resource) > (select a resource load): Select an individual resource load to see a detailed breakdown of connection time, request headers, and response headers.

      "body": "You can use New Relic's containerized private minions (CPM). These are Docker container-based private minions that accept and execute synthetic monitors against your private locations. The CPM can operate in a Docker container system environment or a Kubernetes container orchestration system environment. The CPM will auto-detect its environment to select the appropriate operating mode. General private minion features Because the CPM operates as a container instead of a virtual machine, it delivers many features: Easy to install, start, and update Runs on: Linux macOS Windows Enhanced security and support for non-root user execution Ability to leverage a Docker container as a sandbox environment Customizable monitor check timeout Custom provided modules for scripted monitor types Kubernetes-specific features Also, the CPM delivers the following features in a Kubernetes environment: Integrates with the Kubernetes API to delegate runtime lifecycle management to Kubernetes Does not require privileged access to the Docker socket Supports hosted and on-premise Kubernetes clusters Supports various container engines such as Docker and Containerd Deployable via Helm charts as well as configuration YAMLs Allows job (ping vs. non-ping checks) based resource allocation for optimum resource management Observability offered via the New Relic One Kubernetes cluster explorer System requirements and compatibility To host CPMs, your system must meet the minimum requirements for the chosen system environment. Caution Do not modify any CPM files. New Relic is not liable for any modifications you make. For more information, contact your account representative or a New Relic technical sales rep. Docker container system environment requirements Compatibility for Requirements Operating system Linux kernel: 3.10 or higher. macOS: 10.11 or higher. Windows: Windows 10 64-bit or higher. You must also configure Docker to run Linux containers in order for CPMs to work on Windows systems. Processor A modern, multi-core CPU Memory 2.5 GiB of RAM per CPU core (dedicated) Disk space A minimum of 10 GB per host Docker version Docker 17.12.1-ce or higher Private location key You must have a private location key Caution The Docker CPM is not designed for use with container orchestrators like AWS ECS, Docker Swarm, Apache Mesos, Azure Container Instances, etc. Running the Docker CPM in a container orchestrator will result in unexpected issues because it is itself a container orchestrator. If you're using container orchestration, see our Kubernetes CPM requirements. Kubernetes container orchestration system environment requirements (CPM v3.0.0 or higher) Compatibility for Requirements Operating system Linux kernel: 3.10 or higher macOS: 10.11 or higher Windows: Windows 10 64-bit or higher Processor A modern, multi-core CPU Minion pod CPU (vCPU/Core): 0.5 up to 0.75 Memory: 800 Mi up to 1.6 Gi Resources allocated to a Minion pod are user configurable. Runner pod CPU (vCPU/Core): 0.5 up to 1 Memory: 1.25 Gi up to 3 Gi For a scripted API check, 1.25 Gi will be requested with a limit of 2.5 Gi. For a simple browser or scripted browser check, 2 Gi will be requested with a limit of 3 Gi. Additional considerations: Resources allocated to a runner pod are not user configurable. The maximum limit-request resource ratio for both CPU and memory is 2. Disk space Persistent volume (PV) of at least 10 Gi in size Note that if a ReadWriteOnce (RWO) PV is provided to the minion, an implicit node affinity will be established to ensure the minion and the runner containers are scheduled on the same node. This is required to allow the minion and the associated runners access to the PV, as an RWO PV can be accessed only by a single node in the cluster. Kubernetes version We recommend that your Kubernetes cluster supports Kubernetes v1.15. Caution We have identified a compatibility issue with Kubernetes v1.21+. A workaround is available by disabling the BoundServiceAccountTokenVolume feature gate on the cluster. Private location key You must have a private location key Helm Follow installation instructions for Helm v3 for your OS. Kubectl Follow installation instructions for Kubectl for your OS. To view versions, dependencies, default values for how many runner pods start with each minion, the Persistent volume access mode, and more, please see Show help and examples below. Private location key Before launching CPMs, you must have a private location key. Your CPM uses the key to authenticate against New Relic and run monitors associated with that private location. To find the key for existing private location: Go to one.newrelic.com > Synthetics > Private locations. In the Private locations index, locate the private location you want your CPM to be assigned to. Note the key associated with the private location with the key icon. Sandboxing and Docker dependencies Sandboxing and Docker dependencies are applicable to the CPM in a Docker container system environment. Docker dependencies The CPM runs in Docker and is able to leverage Docker as a sandboxing technology. This ensures complete isolation of the monitor execution, which improves security, reliability, and repeatability. Every time a scripted or browser monitor is executed, the CPM creates a brand new Docker container to run it in called a runner. The minion container needs to be configured to communicate with the Docker engine in order to spawn additional runner containers. Each spawned container is then dedicated to run a check associated with the synthetic monitor running on the private location the minion container is associated with. There are two crucial dependencies at launch. To enable sandboxing, ensure that: Your writable and executable directory is mounted at /tmp. The writable directory can be any directory you want the CPM to write into, but New Relic recommends the system's own /tmp to make things easy. Your writable Docker UNIX socket is mounted at /var/run/docker.sock or DOCKER_HOST environment variable. For more information, see Docker's Daemon socket option. Caution Core count on the host determines how many runner containers the CPM can run concurrently on the host. Since memory requirements are scaled to the expected count of runner containers, we recommend not running multiple CPMs on the same host to avoid resource contention. For additional information on sandboxing and running as a root or non-root user, see Security, sandboxing, and running as non-root. Install and update CPM versions Both installing and updating the CPM use the same command to pull the latest Docker image from the Quay.io repository where the CPM Docker image is hosted. Go to quay.io/repository/newrelic/synthetics-minion for a list of all the releases. CPM images are also hosted on Docker Hub. Go to hub.docker.com/r/newrelic/synthetics-minion/tags for a list of all the releases. Unless hosting the images in a local image repository, connections to either quay.io or docker.io will need to be allowed through your firewall in order for Docker to pull the synthetics-minion and synthetics-minion-runner images. The \"runner\" image is pulled automatically on startup of the synthetics-minion container. See Docker environment configuration and Kubernetes environment configuration for details on how to set a local repository and the runner registry endpoint. Start the CPM To start the CPM, follow the applicable Docker or Kubernetes instructions. Docker start procedure Locate your private location key. Ensure you've enabled Docker dependencies for sandboxing and installed CPM on your system. Run the appropriate script for your system. Tailor the common defaults for /tmp and /var/run/docker.sock in the following examples to match your system. Linux/macOS: docker run \\ --name YOUR_CONTAINER_NAME \\ -e \"MINION_PRIVATE_LOCATION_KEY=YOUR_PRIVATE_LOCATION_KEY\" \\ -v /tmp:/tmp:rw \\ -v /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock:rw \\ -d \\ --restart unless-stopped \\ quay.io/newrelic/synthetics-minion:latest Copy Windows: docker run ^ --name YOUR_CONTAINER_NAME ^ -e \"MINION_PRIVATE_LOCATION_KEY=YOUR_PRIVATE_LOCATION_KEY\" ^ -v /tmp:/tmp:rw ^ -v /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock:rw ^ -d ^ --restart unless-stopped ^ quay.io/newrelic/synthetics-minion:latest Copy View the logs for your minion container: docker logs --follow YOUR_CONTAINER_NAME Copy When a message similar to Synthetics Minion is ready and servicing location YOUR_PRIVATE_LOCATION_LABEL appears, your CPM is up and ready to run monitors assigned to that location. Kubernetes start procedure Locate your private location key. Set up the a namespace for the CPM in your Kubernetes cluster: kubectl create namespace YOUR_NAMESPACE Copy Copy the Helm charts from the New Relic Helm repo. If you are copying the charts for the first time: helm repo add YOUR_REPO_NAME https://helm-charts.newrelic.com Copy If you previously copied the Helm charts from the New Relic Helm repo, then get the latest: helm repo update Copy Install the CPM with the following Helm command: For a fresh installation of the CPM: helm install YOUR_CPM_NAME YOUR_REPO_NAME/synthetics-minion -n YOUR_NAMESPACE --set synthetics.privateLocationKey=YOUR_PRIVATE_LOCATION_KEY Copy To update an existing CPM installation: helm upgrade YOUR_CPM_NAME YOUR_REPO_NAME/synthetics-minion -n YOUR_NAMESPACE --set synthetics.privateLocationKey=YOUR_PRIVATE_LOCATION_KEY Copy Check if the minion pod is up and running: kubectl get -n YOUR_NAMESPACE pods Copy Once the status attribute of each pod is shown as running, your CPM is up and ready to run monitors assigned to your private location. Stop or delete the CPM On a Docker container system environment, use the Docker stop procedure to stop the CPM from running. On a Kubernetes container orchestration system environment, use the Kubernetes delete procedure to stop the CPM from running. Docker stop procedure You can stop a Docker container either by the container name, or the container ID. Container name stop for Linux, macOS, and Windows: docker stop YOUR_CONTAINER_NAME docker rm YOUR_CONTAINER_NAME Copy Container ID stop for Linux/macOS: In the examples the container is stopped and removed. To only stop the container, omit docker rm $CONTAINER_ID. CONTAINER_ID=$(docker ps -aqf name=YOUR_CONTAINER_NAME) docker stop $CONTAINER_ID docker rm $CONTAINER_ID Copy Container ID stop for Windows: In the examples the container is stopped and removed. To only stop the container, omit docker rm $CONTAINER_ID. FOR /F \"tokens=*\" %%CID IN ('docker ps -aqf name=YOUR_CONTAINER_NAME') do (SET CONTAINER_ID=%%CID) docker stop %CONTAINER_ID% docker rm %CONTAINER_ID% Copy Kubernetes delete procedure Get the MINION_POD_INSTALLATION_NAME of the minion pod you want to delete: helm list -n YOUR_NAMESPACE Copy Delete the minion pod: helm uninstall -n YOUR_NAMESPACE MINION_POD_INSTALLATION_NAME Copy Delete the namespace set up for the CPM in your Kubernetes cluster: kubectl delete namespace YOUR_NAMESPACE Copy Show help and examples Use these options as applicable: To get a list of the most commonly used run options directly in the command line interface, run the show help command. To show CPM usage examples as well as the list of all the available run options, run this command: docker run quay.io/newrelic/synthetics-minion:latest help Copy To keep track of Docker logs and verify the health of your monitors, see Containerized private minion (CPM) maintenance and monitoring. For a CPM in the Kubernetes container orchestration system environment, the following Helm show commands can be used to view the chart.yaml and the values.yaml, respectively: helm show chart YOUR_REPO_NAME/synthetics-minion Copy helm show values YOUR_REPO_NAME/synthetics-minion Copy Show license information To show the licensing information for the open source software that we use in the CPM, run the LICENSE command. Run this command to view license information for CPM versions 2.2.27 or higher: docker run quay.io/newrelic/synthetics-minion:latest LICENSE Copy Some of our open-source software is listed under multiple software licenses, and in that case we have listed the license we've chosen to use. Our license information is also available in the our licenses documentation. Configure CPM You can configure the containerized private minion with custom npm modules, preserve data between launches, use environment variables, and more. For more information, see CPM configuration. Networks For both Docker and Kubernetes, the CPM and its runner containers will inherit network settings from the host. For an example of this on a Docker container system environment, see the Docker site. A new bridge network is created for each runner container. This means networking command options like --network and --dns passed to the CPM container at launch (such as through Docker run commands on a Docker container system environment) are not inherited or used by the runner containers. When these networks are created, they pull from the default IP address pool configured for daemon. For an example of this on a Docker container system environment, see the Docker site. Typically, the runner network is removed after the check is completed. However, if a CPM exits while a check is still running, or exits in another unexpected circumstance, these networks may get orphaned. This can potentially use up IP address space that is available to the Docker daemon. If this happens, you may see INTERNAL ENGINE ERROR code: 31 entries in your CPM logging when trying to create a new runner container. To clean these up in Docker container system environments only, run docker network prune. Security, sandboxing, and running as non-root By default, the software running inside a CPM is executed with root user privileges. This is suitable for most scenarios, as the execution is sandboxed. In a Docker container system environment: To change the default AppArmor profile used by containers that CPM spawns to run monitors, see the environment variable MINION_RUNNER_APPARMOR (CPM version 3.0.3 or higher) or MINION_DOCKER_RUNNER_APPARMOR (CPM version up to v3.0.2). To run the CPM as a non-root user, additional steps are required: Run as non-root user for Docker For more information, see Docker's official documentation about security and AppArmor security profiles. If your environment requires you to run the CPM as a non-root user, follow this procedure. In the following example, the non-root user is my_user. Ensure that my_user can use the Docker engine on the host: Verify that my_user belongs to the \"docker\" system group. OR Enable the Docker TCP socket option, and pass the DOCKER_HOST environment variable to CPM. Verify that my_user has read/write permissions to all the directories and volumes passed to CPM. To set these permission, use the chmod command. Get the uid of my_user for use in the run command: id -u my_user. Once these conditions are met, use the option \"-u <uid>:<gid>\" when launching CPM: docker run ... -u 1002 ... Copy OR docker run ... -u 1002 -e DOCKER_HOST=http://localhost:2375 ... Copy Docker image repository A single CPM Docker image serves both the Docker container system environment and Kubernetes container orchestration system environment. The Docker image is hosted on quay.io. To make sure your Docker image is up-to-date, see the quay.io newrelic/synthetics-minion repository. Additional considerations for CPM connection Connection Description CPMs without Internet access A CPM can operate without access to the internet, but with some exceptions. The public internet health check can be disabled using the environment variables named MINION_NETWORK_HEALTHCHECK_DISABLED for a Docker container system environment or synthetics.minionNetworkHealthCheckDisabled for a Kubernetes container orchestration system environment. The CPM needs to be able to contact the \"synthetics-horde.nr-data.net\" domain. This is necessary for it to report data to New Relic and to receive monitors to execute. Ask your network administration if this is a problem and how to set up exceptions. Communicate with Synthetics via a proxy To set up communication with New Relic by proxy, use the environment variables named MINION_API_PROXY*. Arguments passed at launch This applies to a Docker container environment only. Arguments passed to the CPM container at launch do not get passed on to the containers spawned by the CPM. Docker has no concept of \"inheritance\" or a \"hierarchy\" of containers, and we don't copy the configuration that is passed from CPM to the monitor-running containers. The only shared configuration between them is the one set at the Docker daemon level.",

Restricted Users on accounts with original product-based pricing have view-only access to all synthetic monitoring features except: Secure credentials Private locations (although they can query a limited amount of data via NRQL) This means that users with this role do not have access to all create, edit, and delete capabilities for synthetic monitoring features (as well as view capability for secure credentials) until they are given a role with the appropriate capabilities. Customize access To get started, follow standard procedures to create a custom role. You can add View and Edit capabilities to any role for the following: Monitors Monitor scripts Private locations Monitor downtimes Secure credentials Users on New Relic One user model For users on the New Relic One user model, full platform users have the ability to use the synthetic monitoring UI to create and manage synthetic monitors, while basic users cannot do that.

      "body": "Synthetic monitoring is a suite of automated, scriptable tools to monitor your websites, critical business transactions, and API endpoints. You can simulate user traffic to proactively detect and resolve outages and poor performance of critical endpoints before your customers notice. Why it matters With synthetic monitoring, you can: Get the context of failures by connecting the availability and performance of endpoints to the underlying applications and infrastructure. Easily diagnose if an issue stems from the network or AWS location, a slow third party resource, or the health of backend services or infrastructure. Add synthetic monitoring into build automation and CI/CD pipelines to automatically track performance and check functionality for each deployment. Expand your monitoring further with real, Selenium-powered scripted browsers, which test login procedures, searches, and other critical business transactions. Monitor your API endpoints with API tests. Ready to get started? If you don't already have one, sign up for a New Relic account. It's free, forever! Advanced testing Synthetic monitoring allows you to proactively monitor your website or API endpoint to ensure your content is not only available, but fully functional. Synthetic monitoring browser tests send real, Selenium-powered Google Chrome browsers to your site from locations around the world to ensure your content is always up, everywhere. Scripted browsers expand your testing capabilities, so you can test uncommon user flows or beta-test complex procedures. For example, ensure your users are able to sign up for your newsletter, add an item to their cart, or search for and find a piece of critical content with a simple JavaScript-like language. Test your backend with API monitors, which allow you to run scripted tests against any API endpoint. Enhanced monitoring and reporting Synthetic monitoring aggregates the results of each check into metrics, allowing you to see patterns and identify causes of poor performance. Synthetic monitoring also stores each and every monitor result, so you can see exactly where your website broke down. Alerts notify you if your website or API endpoint is inaccessible. You can even expand your geographical coverage or monitor internal websites by creating private locations. You can also query your monitor results for a closer look. New Relic retains monitor results for thirteen months, ensuring you can compare usage year over year. Additional features Synthetic monitoring includes the following features: Feature Description Real browsers With simple browser and scripted browser monitors, synthetic monitoring doesn't simply check that your host is up. It loads the actual page content in a real, fully virtualized Google Chrome browser (powered by Selenium) to provide testing that mirrors your users' actions. Detailed results view Synthetic monitoring stores every single run of your monitor for 13 months, so you can view a detailed breakdown of each and every check. You can get a snapshot of your website's performance and availability, or hunt down specific problems. Comparative charts with browser monitoring Use New Relic's comparative charting feature for a direct page load time comparison between real user (browser monitoring) interactions and the synthetic monitors. For example, during a page outage, you can compare trends to see if an issue is also visible in synthetic monitoring, or if it is caused by other variables. Advanced scripted monitoring Use scripted browsers to run complex test cases against your website. Ensure critical processes like checkout and login are always running smoothly, and build a baseline to compare against when things go wrong. With a built-in scripting IDE based on Node.js, create scripts quickly without leaving your browser. Global test coverage Check coverage from locations around the world to ensure your users can access your website from anywhere, anytime. Monitor sites behind your firewall by adding the synthetic monitoring static IP addresses to your allow list. Use private locations to monitor internal sites or to expand your coverage to new locations. Compatibility with popular analytics platforms Synthetic monitoring specifically excludes scripts for popular analytics services, like Google Analytics. This ensures your analytics tools continue to receive the exact same data, even with thousands of monitors checking your website each month. You can unblock any of the services blocked by default, or block additional services. REST API functions Synthetic monitoring includes a REST API, which you can use to manage: Simple monitors and scripted monitors Categories and labels for monitors Alert notifications Data protection and privacy The data from synthetic monitoring is test data, representing typical interaction with the webpage or application. It is never actual data from human beings. The data collected when you use synthetic monitoring therefore is not personal data. For more information, see the Synthetic monitoring security documentation. Compatibility and requirements Synthetic monitoring does not require any software except a supported browser. Important To monitor a site behind your firewall, add the synthetic monitoring public minion IP addresses to your allow list. Permissions By default, all users in your account can: View synthetic monitoring pages. Add, edit, and delete monitors. For more fine-grained control, you can enable the optional permissions system. The permissions system allows you to manage the level of access for users to view and edit within synthetic monitoring (for example, monitors and private locations).",

      "body": "You can use New Relic's containerized private minions (CPM). These are Docker container-based private minions that accept and execute synthetic monitors against your private locations. The CPM can operate in a Docker container system environment or a Kubernetes container orchestration system environment. The CPM will auto-detect its environment to select the appropriate operating mode. General private minion features Because the CPM operates as a container instead of a virtual machine, it delivers many features: Easy to install, start, and update Runs on: Linux macOS Windows Enhanced security and support for non-root user execution Ability to leverage a Docker container as a sandbox environment Customizable monitor check timeout Custom provided modules for scripted monitor types Kubernetes-specific features Also, the CPM delivers the following features in a Kubernetes environment: Integrates with the Kubernetes API to delegate runtime lifecycle management to Kubernetes Does not require privileged access to the Docker socket Supports hosted and on-premise Kubernetes clusters Supports various container engines such as Docker and Containerd Deployable via Helm charts as well as configuration YAMLs Allows job (ping vs. non-ping checks) based resource allocation for optimum resource management Observability offered via the New Relic One Kubernetes cluster explorer System requirements and compatibility To host CPMs, your system must meet the minimum requirements for the chosen system environment. Caution Do not modify any CPM files. New Relic is not liable for any modifications you make. For more information, contact your account representative or a New Relic technical sales rep. Docker container system environment requirements Compatibility for Requirements Operating system Linux kernel: 3.10 or higher. macOS: 10.11 or higher. Windows: Windows 10 64-bit or higher. You must also configure Docker to run Linux containers in order for CPMs to work on Windows systems. Processor A modern, multi-core CPU Memory 2.5 GiB of RAM per CPU core (dedicated) Disk space A minimum of 10 GB per host Docker version Docker 17.12.1-ce or higher Private location key You must have a private location key Caution The Docker CPM is not designed for use with container orchestrators like AWS ECS, Docker Swarm, Apache Mesos, Azure Container Instances, etc. Running the Docker CPM in a container orchestrator will result in unexpected issues because it is itself a container orchestrator. If you're using container orchestration, see our Kubernetes CPM requirements. Kubernetes container orchestration system environment requirements (CPM v3.0.0 or higher) Compatibility for Requirements Operating system Linux kernel: 3.10 or higher macOS: 10.11 or higher Windows: Windows 10 64-bit or higher Processor A modern, multi-core CPU Minion pod CPU (vCPU/Core): 0.5 up to 0.75 Memory: 800 Mi up to 1.6 Gi Resources allocated to a Minion pod are user configurable. Runner pod CPU (vCPU/Core): 0.5 up to 1 Memory: 1.25 Gi up to 3 Gi For a scripted API check, 1.25 Gi will be requested with a limit of 2.5 Gi. For a simple browser or scripted browser check, 2 Gi will be requested with a limit of 3 Gi. Additional considerations: Resources allocated to a runner pod are not user configurable. The maximum limit-request resource ratio for both CPU and memory is 2. Disk space Persistent volume (PV) of at least 10 Gi in size Note that if a ReadWriteOnce (RWO) PV is provided to the minion, an implicit node affinity will be established to ensure the minion and the runner containers are scheduled on the same node. This is required to allow the minion and the associated runners access to the PV, as an RWO PV can be accessed only by a single node in the cluster. Kubernetes version We recommend that your Kubernetes cluster supports Kubernetes v1.15. Caution We have identified a compatibility issue with Kubernetes v1.21+. A workaround is available by disabling the BoundServiceAccountTokenVolume feature gate on the cluster. Private location key You must have a private location key Helm Follow installation instructions for Helm v3 for your OS. Kubectl Follow installation instructions for Kubectl for your OS. To view versions, dependencies, default values for how many runner pods start with each minion, the Persistent volume access mode, and more, please see Show help and examples below. Private location key Before launching CPMs, you must have a private location key. Your CPM uses the key to authenticate against New Relic and run monitors associated with that private location. To find the key for existing private location: Go to one.newrelic.com > Synthetics > Private locations. In the Private locations index, locate the private location you want your CPM to be assigned to. Note the key associated with the private location with the key icon. Sandboxing and Docker dependencies Sandboxing and Docker dependencies are applicable to the CPM in a Docker container system environment. Docker dependencies The CPM runs in Docker and is able to leverage Docker as a sandboxing technology. This ensures complete isolation of the monitor execution, which improves security, reliability, and repeatability. Every time a scripted or browser monitor is executed, the CPM creates a brand new Docker container to run it in called a runner. The minion container needs to be configured to communicate with the Docker engine in order to spawn additional runner containers. Each spawned container is then dedicated to run a check associated with the synthetic monitor running on the private location the minion container is associated with. There are two crucial dependencies at launch. To enable sandboxing, ensure that: Your writable and executable directory is mounted at /tmp. The writable directory can be any directory you want the CPM to write into, but New Relic recommends the system's own /tmp to make things easy. Your writable Docker UNIX socket is mounted at /var/run/docker.sock or DOCKER_HOST environment variable. For more information, see Docker's Daemon socket option. Caution Core count on the host determines how many runner containers the CPM can run concurrently on the host. Since memory requirements are scaled to the expected count of runner containers, we recommend not running multiple CPMs on the same host to avoid resource contention. For additional information on sandboxing and running as a root or non-root user, see Security, sandboxing, and running as non-root. Install and update CPM versions Both installing and updating the CPM use the same command to pull the latest Docker image from the Quay.io repository where the CPM Docker image is hosted. Go to quay.io/repository/newrelic/synthetics-minion for a list of all the releases. CPM images are also hosted on Docker Hub. Go to hub.docker.com/r/newrelic/synthetics-minion/tags for a list of all the releases. Unless hosting the images in a local image repository, connections to either quay.io or docker.io will need to be allowed through your firewall in order for Docker to pull the synthetics-minion and synthetics-minion-runner images. The \"runner\" image is pulled automatically on startup of the synthetics-minion container. See Docker environment configuration and Kubernetes environment configuration for details on how to set a local repository and the runner registry endpoint. Start the CPM To start the CPM, follow the applicable Docker or Kubernetes instructions. Docker start procedure Locate your private location key. Ensure you've enabled Docker dependencies for sandboxing and installed CPM on your system. Run the appropriate script for your system. Tailor the common defaults for /tmp and /var/run/docker.sock in the following examples to match your system. Linux/macOS: docker run \\ --name YOUR_CONTAINER_NAME \\ -e \"MINION_PRIVATE_LOCATION_KEY=YOUR_PRIVATE_LOCATION_KEY\" \\ -v /tmp:/tmp:rw \\ -v /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock:rw \\ -d \\ --restart unless-stopped \\ quay.io/newrelic/synthetics-minion:latest Copy Windows: docker run ^ --name YOUR_CONTAINER_NAME ^ -e \"MINION_PRIVATE_LOCATION_KEY=YOUR_PRIVATE_LOCATION_KEY\" ^ -v /tmp:/tmp:rw ^ -v /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock:rw ^ -d ^ --restart unless-stopped ^ quay.io/newrelic/synthetics-minion:latest Copy View the logs for your minion container: docker logs --follow YOUR_CONTAINER_NAME Copy When a message similar to Synthetics Minion is ready and servicing location YOUR_PRIVATE_LOCATION_LABEL appears, your CPM is up and ready to run monitors assigned to that location. Kubernetes start procedure Locate your private location key. Set up the a namespace for the CPM in your Kubernetes cluster: kubectl create namespace YOUR_NAMESPACE Copy Copy the Helm charts from the New Relic Helm repo. If you are copying the charts for the first time: helm repo add YOUR_REPO_NAME https://helm-charts.newrelic.com Copy If you previously copied the Helm charts from the New Relic Helm repo, then get the latest: helm repo update Copy Install the CPM with the following Helm command: For a fresh installation of the CPM: helm install YOUR_CPM_NAME YOUR_REPO_NAME/synthetics-minion -n YOUR_NAMESPACE --set synthetics.privateLocationKey=YOUR_PRIVATE_LOCATION_KEY Copy To update an existing CPM installation: helm upgrade YOUR_CPM_NAME YOUR_REPO_NAME/synthetics-minion -n YOUR_NAMESPACE --set synthetics.privateLocationKey=YOUR_PRIVATE_LOCATION_KEY Copy Check if the minion pod is up and running: kubectl get -n YOUR_NAMESPACE pods Copy Once the status attribute of each pod is shown as running, your CPM is up and ready to run monitors assigned to your private location. Stop or delete the CPM On a Docker container system environment, use the Docker stop procedure to stop the CPM from running. On a Kubernetes container orchestration system environment, use the Kubernetes delete procedure to stop the CPM from running. Docker stop procedure You can stop a Docker container either by the container name, or the container ID. Container name stop for Linux, macOS, and Windows: docker stop YOUR_CONTAINER_NAME docker rm YOUR_CONTAINER_NAME Copy Container ID stop for Linux/macOS: In the examples the container is stopped and removed. To only stop the container, omit docker rm $CONTAINER_ID. CONTAINER_ID=$(docker ps -aqf name=YOUR_CONTAINER_NAME) docker stop $CONTAINER_ID docker rm $CONTAINER_ID Copy Container ID stop for Windows: In the examples the container is stopped and removed. To only stop the container, omit docker rm $CONTAINER_ID. FOR /F \"tokens=*\" %%CID IN ('docker ps -aqf name=YOUR_CONTAINER_NAME') do (SET CONTAINER_ID=%%CID) docker stop %CONTAINER_ID% docker rm %CONTAINER_ID% Copy Kubernetes delete procedure Get the MINION_POD_INSTALLATION_NAME of the minion pod you want to delete: helm list -n YOUR_NAMESPACE Copy Delete the minion pod: helm uninstall -n YOUR_NAMESPACE MINION_POD_INSTALLATION_NAME Copy Delete the namespace set up for the CPM in your Kubernetes cluster: kubectl delete namespace YOUR_NAMESPACE Copy Show help and examples Use these options as applicable: To get a list of the most commonly used run options directly in the command line interface, run the show help command. To show CPM usage examples as well as the list of all the available run options, run this command: docker run quay.io/newrelic/synthetics-minion:latest help Copy To keep track of Docker logs and verify the health of your monitors, see Containerized private minion (CPM) maintenance and monitoring. For a CPM in the Kubernetes container orchestration system environment, the following Helm show commands can be used to view the chart.yaml and the values.yaml, respectively: helm show chart YOUR_REPO_NAME/synthetics-minion Copy helm show values YOUR_REPO_NAME/synthetics-minion Copy Show license information To show the licensing information for the open source software that we use in the CPM, run the LICENSE command. Run this command to view license information for CPM versions 2.2.27 or higher: docker run quay.io/newrelic/synthetics-minion:latest LICENSE Copy Some of our open-source software is listed under multiple software licenses, and in that case we have listed the license we've chosen to use. Our license information is also available in the our licenses documentation. Configure CPM You can configure the containerized private minion with custom npm modules, preserve data between launches, use environment variables, and more. For more information, see CPM configuration. Networks For both Docker and Kubernetes, the CPM and its runner containers will inherit network settings from the host. For an example of this on a Docker container system environment, see the Docker site. A new bridge network is created for each runner container. This means networking command options like --network and --dns passed to the CPM container at launch (such as through Docker run commands on a Docker container system environment) are not inherited or used by the runner containers. When these networks are created, they pull from the default IP address pool configured for daemon. For an example of this on a Docker container system environment, see the Docker site. Typically, the runner network is removed after the check is completed. However, if a CPM exits while a check is still running, or exits in another unexpected circumstance, these networks may get orphaned. This can potentially use up IP address space that is available to the Docker daemon. If this happens, you may see INTERNAL ENGINE ERROR code: 31 entries in your CPM logging when trying to create a new runner container. To clean these up in Docker container system environments only, run docker network prune. Security, sandboxing, and running as non-root By default, the software running inside a CPM is executed with root user privileges. This is suitable for most scenarios, as the execution is sandboxed. In a Docker container system environment: To change the default AppArmor profile used by containers that CPM spawns to run monitors, see the environment variable MINION_RUNNER_APPARMOR (CPM version 3.0.3 or higher) or MINION_DOCKER_RUNNER_APPARMOR (CPM version up to v3.0.2). To run the CPM as a non-root user, additional steps are required: Run as non-root user for Docker For more information, see Docker's official documentation about security and AppArmor security profiles. If your environment requires you to run the CPM as a non-root user, follow this procedure. In the following example, the non-root user is my_user. Ensure that my_user can use the Docker engine on the host: Verify that my_user belongs to the \"docker\" system group. OR Enable the Docker TCP socket option, and pass the DOCKER_HOST environment variable to CPM. Verify that my_user has read/write permissions to all the directories and volumes passed to CPM. To set these permission, use the chmod command. Get the uid of my_user for use in the run command: id -u my_user. Once these conditions are met, use the option \"-u <uid>:<gid>\" when launching CPM: docker run ... -u 1002 ... Copy OR docker run ... -u 1002 -e DOCKER_HOST=http://localhost:2375 ... Copy Docker image repository A single CPM Docker image serves both the Docker container system environment and Kubernetes container orchestration system environment. The Docker image is hosted on quay.io. To make sure your Docker image is up-to-date, see the quay.io newrelic/synthetics-minion repository. Additional considerations for CPM connection Connection Description CPMs without Internet access A CPM can operate without access to the internet, but with some exceptions. The public internet health check can be disabled using the environment variables named MINION_NETWORK_HEALTHCHECK_DISABLED for a Docker container system environment or synthetics.minionNetworkHealthCheckDisabled for a Kubernetes container orchestration system environment. The CPM needs to be able to contact the \"synthetics-horde.nr-data.net\" domain. This is necessary for it to report data to New Relic and to receive monitors to execute. Ask your network administration if this is a problem and how to set up exceptions. Communicate with Synthetics via a proxy To set up communication with New Relic by proxy, use the environment variables named MINION_API_PROXY*. Arguments passed at launch This applies to a Docker container environment only. Arguments passed to the CPM container at launch do not get passed on to the containers spawned by the CPM. Docker has no concept of \"inheritance\" or a \"hierarchy\" of containers, and we don't copy the configuration that is passed from CPM to the monitor-running containers. The only shared configuration between them is the one set at the Docker daemon level.",

      "body": "Read on to learn how to configure your containerized private minion (CPM). You can do the following to customize your CPMs: Set up custom modules for scripted browsers in New Relic. Preserve launch data with permanent data storage. Use environment variables in your configuration. You may not modify any CPM files and New Relic is not liable for any modifications you make. Guidelines for mounting volumes All directories and files must be assigned group ownership as 3729 with read/write permissions. This ensures that the Runner, which uses uid: 1000 and gid: 3729, has access to all the mounted volumes. However, the Minion is able to run as root (uid: 0) or with any uid between the range of [2000, 4000], inclusive. For more information, see running as non-root in Kubernetes or Docker. Docker Directories are mounted onto a container as volumes by specifying a -v argument within docker run For example, docker run ... -v /path/to/src:/path/to/dest:rw Kubernetes It is possible to add a directory onto a persistent volume (PV) by using kubectl cp. However, alternative approaches are supported as long as the file permissions are set appropriately. For example, kubectl cp /path/to/src <POD_NAME>:/path/to/dest will add a directory onto each PV in the specified pod Each PV must have a separate copy of the directories. For example, a cluster with n Minion replicas must have n PVs, each with their own copy of directories The directories and files must be added prior to the Minion boot up, otherwise the Minion must be restarted to detect the updates Custom npm modules Custom npm modules are exclusive to the CPM. They allow you to provide an arbitrary set of npm modules, and make them available for scripted monitors in Synthetics. To set up the modules: Create a directory which contains a package.json, following the npm official guidelines, in the root of the directory. Anything contained in the dependencies field will be installed by the CPM at start, and made available when running monitors on that private minion. Optionally, you can override the root level package.json with a Node version-specific directory. This allows a script to be updated per monitor runtime if a Node version of a runtime is no longer compatible with your dependencies. See an example of this below. Custom module directory In this example, a custom module directory is used with the following structure: /example-custom-modules-dir/ ├── counter │ ├── index.js │ └── package.json └── package.json ⇦ the only mandatory file Copy The package.json defines dependencies as both a local module (for example, counter) and an npm hosted modules (for example, async version ^2.6.1): { \"name\": \"custom-modules\", \"version\": \"1.0.0\", ⇦ optional \"description\": \"example custom modules directory\", ⇦ optional \"dependencies\": { \"async\": \"^2.6.1\", ⇦ npm hosted module \"counter\": \"file:./counter\" ⇦ Local module } } Copy Node version-specific overrides You can declare a package.json per Node version that will override the root level package.json. This allows a monitor script to be updated per monitor runtime in the event that the Node version of a runtime is no longer compatible with your dependencies. As shown in the first example, local modules can still be defined within a version specific directory. If a package.json is not defined for a specific Node version, then the root level package.json will be used to install dependencies. In this example, a custom module directory is used with the following structure: /example-custom-modules-dir/ ├── 6.11.2 ⇦ optional Node specific directory │ └── package.json └── 10.15.0 ⇦ optional Node specific directory │ └── package.json ├── counter │ ├── index.js │ └── package.json └── package.json ⇦ the only mandatory file ​ Copy Once you create the custom modules directory and the package.json you can apply it to your CPM for Docker and Kubernetes. Docker For Docker, launch CPM mounting the directory at /var/lib/newrelic/synthetics/modules. For example: docker run ... -v /example-custom-modules-dir:/var/lib/newrelic/synthetics/modules:rw ... Copy Kubernetes Complete the following: Launch the CPM, setting a value for the persistence.customModules configuration value either in the command line or in a YAML file during installation. The value should specify the subpath on your Minion's Persistent Volume where your custom modules files exist. For example: helm install ... --set persistence.customModules=<custom-modules-subpath> ... Copy Make sure that your custom modules directory is available on the Minion Pod. You can use kubectl cp as one method to copy the directory from your host to the Minion. For example: kubectl cp /example-custom-modules-dir <namespace>/<pod_name>:/var/lib/newrelic/synthetics/modules Copy Look at the CPM logs for \"... Initialization of Custom Modules ...\" to see if the modules were installed properly, or if there were any errors. The npm installation logs will be shown. Now you can add \"require('async');\" into the script of monitors you send to this private location. Change package.json for custom modules Along with npm modules, you can also use Node.js modules. To change the custom modules used by your CPM, modify package.json and reboot the CPM. It will detect the change in configuration during the reboot, and then clean up and re-install. Caution Local modules: While your package.json can include any local module, these modules must reside inside the tree under your custom module directory. If stored outside the tree, the initialization process will fail and you will see an error message in the docker logs after launching CPM. Permanent data storage CPM is a stateless application and does not preserve information from prior requests or sessions by default. However, you can preserve data between launches by enabling permanent data storage. For example, you can permanently set how the minion identifies itself (for example, Minion_ID), and use it to associate the data visible in Synthetics and Insights events with the exact minion that produced it. To set permanent data storage on Docker: Create a directory. Launch the CPM, mounting the directory at /var/lib/newrelic/synthetics. Example: docker run ... -v /example-permanent-dir:/var/lib/newrelic/synthetics:rw ... Copy To set permanent data storage on Kubernetes: Launch the CPM, setting a value for the persistence.permanentData configuration value either in the command line or in a YAML file during installation. The value should specify the subpath on your Minion's Persistent Volume where you want the data to be saved. Example: helm install ... --set persistence.permanentData=<permanent-data-subpath> ... Copy User-defined environment variables for scripted monitors Containerized private minions let you configure environment variables for use in scripted monitors. These variables are hosted locally on the CPM and can be accessed via $env.USER_DEFINED_VARIABLES. There are two ways to set user-defined variables: by mounting a JSON file or by supplying an environment variable to the CPM on launch. If both are provided, the CPM will use values provided from the environment only. Mounting JSON file The JSON file must have read permissions and contain a JSON formatted map. Example user-defined variable file: { \"KEY\" : \"VALUE\", \"User_Name\": \"MINION\", \"My_Password\": \"PASSW0RD 1 2 3\", \"my_URL\": \"https://newrelic.com/\", \"ETC\" : \"ETC\" } Copy The file must be available or mounted to the path in your container: /var/lib/newrelic/synthetics/variables/user_defined_variables.json Docker example: docker run ... -v /example-user-defined-variables.json:/var/lib/newrelic/synthetics/variables/user_defined_variables.json:rw ... Copy Kubernetes example: When mounting a JSON file to your Minion Pod in Kubernetes, you can either copy the file directly to the Minion Pod or to a Pod that has access to the same Persistent Volume and Persistent Volume Claim that the Minion will use. After successfully loading the file, you may need to restart your Minion Pod for the change to take effect. kubectl cp path/to/user_defined_variables.json <namespace>/<pod_name>:/var/lib/newrelic/synthetics/variables/user_defined_variables.json Copy Passing as an environment variable Use the -e flag to set up an environment variable named MINION_USER_DEFINED_VARIABLES and give it a value of a JSON formatted map string. docker run ... -e MINION_USER_DEFINED_ENV_VARIABLES='{\"KEY\":\"VALUE\",\"NAME\":\"MINION\",\"ETC\":\"ETC\"}' ... Copy Tip The CPM on Kubernetes does not currently support loading user-defined environment variables via environment variable. You will have to configure your Kubernetes CPM by mounting a JSON file. Accessing user-defined environment variables from scripts To reference a configured user-defined environment variable, use the reserved $env.USER_DEFINED_VARIABLES followed by the name of a given variable with dot notation. For example, $env.USER_DEFINED_VARIABLES.MY_VARIABLE Caution User-defined environment variables are not sanitized from logs. For sensitive information, consider using the secure credentials feature. Environment variables Environmental variables allow you to fine-tune the CPM configuration to meet your specific environmental and functional needs.

In this example, a custom module directory is used with the following structure: /example-custom-modules-dir/ ├── 6.11.2 ⇦ optional Node specific directory │ └── package.json └── 10.15.0 ⇦ optional Node specific directory │ └── package.json ├── counter │ ├── index.js │ └── package.json └── package.json ⇦ the only mandatory file ​ Copy Once you create the custom modules directory and the package.json you can apply it to your CPM for Docker and Kubernetes. Docker For Docker, launch CPM mounting the directory at /var/lib/newrelic/synthetics/modules. For example: docker run ... -v /example-custom-modules-dir:/var/lib/newrelic/synthetics/modules:rw ... Copy Kubernetes Complete the following: Launch the CPM, setting a value for the persistence.customModules configuration value either in the command line or in a YAML file during installation. The value should specify the subpath on your Minion's Persistent Volume where your custom modules files exist. For example: helm install ... --set persistence.customModules=<custom-modules-subpath> ... Copy Make sure that your custom modules directory is available on the Minion Pod. You can use kubectl cp as one method to copy the directory from your host to the Minion. For example: kubectl cp /example-custom-modules-dir <namespace>/<pod_name>:/var/lib/newrelic/synthetics/modules Copy Look at the CPM logs for \"... Initialization of Custom Modules ...\" to see if the modules were installed properly, or if there were any errors. The npm installation logs will be shown. Now you can add \"require('async');\" into the script of monitors you send to this private location. Change package.json for custom modules Along with npm modules, you can also use Node.js modules. To change the custom modules used by your CPM, modify package.json and reboot the CPM. It will detect the change in configuration during the reboot, and then clean up and re-install. Caution Local modules: While your package.json can include any local module, these modules must reside inside the tree under your custom module directory. If stored outside the tree, the initialization process will fail and you will see an error message in the docker logs after launching CPM. Permanent data storage CPM is a stateless application and does not preserve information from prior requests or sessions by default. However, you can preserve data between launches by enabling permanent data storage. For example, you can permanently set how the minion identifies itself (for example, Minion_ID), and use it to associate the data visible in Synthetics and Insights events with the exact minion that produced it. To set permanent data storage on Docker: Create a directory. Launch the CPM, mounting the directory at /var/lib/newrelic/synthetics. Example: docker run ... -v /example-permanent-dir:/var/lib/newrelic/synthetics:rw ... Copy To set permanent data storage on Kubernetes: Launch the CPM, setting a value for the persistence.permanentData configuration value either in the command line or in a YAML file during installation. The value should specify the subpath on your Minion's Persistent Volume where you want the data to be saved. Example: helm install ... --set persistence.permanentData=<permanent-data-subpath> ... Copy User-defined environment variables for scripted monitors Containerized private minions let you configure environment variables for use in scripted monitors. These variables are hosted locally on the CPM and can be accessed via $env.USER_DEFINED_VARIABLES. There are two ways to set user-defined variables: by mounting a JSON file or by supplying an environment variable to the CPM on launch. If both are provided, the CPM will use values provided from the environment only. Mounting JSON file The JSON file must have read permissions and contain a JSON formatted map. Example user-defined variable file: { \"KEY\" : \"VALUE\", \"User_Name\": \"MINION\", \"My_Password\": \"PASSW0RD 1 2 3\", \"my_URL\": \"https://newrelic.com/\", \"ETC\" : \"ETC\" } Copy The file must be available or mounted to the path in your container: /var/lib/newrelic/synthetics/variables/user_defined_variables.json Docker example: docker run ... -v /example-user-defined-variables.json:/var/lib/newrelic/synthetics/variables/user_defined_variables.json:rw ... Copy Kubernetes example: When mounting a JSON file to your Minion Pod in Kubernetes, you can either copy the file directly to the Minion Pod or to a Pod that has access to the same Persistent Volume and Persistent Volume Claim that the Minion will use. After successfully loading the file, you may need to restart your Minion Pod for the change to take effect. kubectl cp path/to/user_defined_variables.json <namespace>/<pod_name>:/var/lib/newrelic/synthetics/variables/user_defined_variables.json Copy Passing as an environment variable Use the -e flag to set up an environment variable named MINION_USER_DEFINED_VARIABLES and give it a value of a JSON formatted map string. docker run ... -e MINION_USER_DEFINED_ENV_VARIABLES='{\"KEY\":\"VALUE\",\"NAME\":\"MINION\",\"ETC\":\"ETC\"}' ... Copy Tip The CPM on Kubernetes does not currently support loading user-defined environment variables via environment variable. You will have to configure your Kubernetes CPM by mounting a JSON file. Accessing user-defined environment variables from scripts To reference a configured user-defined environment variable, use the reserved $env.USER_DEFINED_VARIABLES followed by the name of a given variable with dot notation. For example, $env.USER_DEFINED_VARIABLES.MY_VARIABLE Caution User-defined environment variables are not sanitized from logs. For sensitive information, consider using the secure credentials feature.

      "body": "Synthetic monitoring is a suite of automated, scriptable tools to monitor your websites, critical business transactions, and API endpoints. You can simulate user traffic to proactively detect and resolve outages and poor performance of critical endpoints before your customers notice. Why it matters With synthetic monitoring, you can: Get the context of failures by connecting the availability and performance of endpoints to the underlying applications and infrastructure. Easily diagnose if an issue stems from the network or AWS location, a slow third party resource, or the health of backend services or infrastructure. Add synthetic monitoring into build automation and CI/CD pipelines to automatically track performance and check functionality for each deployment. Expand your monitoring further with real, Selenium-powered scripted browsers, which test login procedures, searches, and other critical business transactions. Monitor your API endpoints with API tests. Ready to get started? If you don't already have one, sign up for a New Relic account. It's free, forever! Advanced testing Synthetic monitoring allows you to proactively monitor your website or API endpoint to ensure your content is not only available, but fully functional. Synthetic monitoring browser tests send real, Selenium-powered Google Chrome browsers to your site from locations around the world to ensure your content is always up, everywhere. Scripted browsers expand your testing capabilities, so you can test uncommon user flows or beta-test complex procedures. For example, ensure your users are able to sign up for your newsletter, add an item to their cart, or search for and find a piece of critical content with a simple JavaScript-like language. Test your backend with API monitors, which allow you to run scripted tests against any API endpoint. Enhanced monitoring and reporting Synthetic monitoring aggregates the results of each check into metrics, allowing you to see patterns and identify causes of poor performance. Synthetic monitoring also stores each and every monitor result, so you can see exactly where your website broke down. Alerts notify you if your website or API endpoint is inaccessible. You can even expand your geographical coverage or monitor internal websites by creating private locations. You can also query your monitor results for a closer look. New Relic retains monitor results for thirteen months, ensuring you can compare usage year over year. Additional features Synthetic monitoring includes the following features: Feature Description Real browsers With simple browser and scripted browser monitors, synthetic monitoring doesn't simply check that your host is up. It loads the actual page content in a real, fully virtualized Google Chrome browser (powered by Selenium) to provide testing that mirrors your users' actions. Detailed results view Synthetic monitoring stores every single run of your monitor for 13 months, so you can view a detailed breakdown of each and every check. You can get a snapshot of your website's performance and availability, or hunt down specific problems. Comparative charts with browser monitoring Use New Relic's comparative charting feature for a direct page load time comparison between real user (browser monitoring) interactions and the synthetic monitors. For example, during a page outage, you can compare trends to see if an issue is also visible in synthetic monitoring, or if it is caused by other variables. Advanced scripted monitoring Use scripted browsers to run complex test cases against your website. Ensure critical processes like checkout and login are always running smoothly, and build a baseline to compare against when things go wrong. With a built-in scripting IDE based on Node.js, create scripts quickly without leaving your browser. Global test coverage Check coverage from locations around the world to ensure your users can access your website from anywhere, anytime. Monitor sites behind your firewall by adding the synthetic monitoring static IP addresses to your allow list. Use private locations to monitor internal sites or to expand your coverage to new locations. Compatibility with popular analytics platforms Synthetic monitoring specifically excludes scripts for popular analytics services, like Google Analytics. This ensures your analytics tools continue to receive the exact same data, even with thousands of monitors checking your website each month. You can unblock any of the services blocked by default, or block additional services. REST API functions Synthetic monitoring includes a REST API, which you can use to manage: Simple monitors and scripted monitors Categories and labels for monitors Alert notifications Data protection and privacy The data from synthetic monitoring is test data, representing typical interaction with the webpage or application. It is never actual data from human beings. The data collected when you use synthetic monitoring therefore is not personal data. For more information, see the Synthetic monitoring security documentation. Compatibility and requirements Synthetic monitoring does not require any software except a supported browser. Important To monitor a site behind your firewall, add the synthetic monitoring public minion IP addresses to your allow list. Permissions By default, all users in your account can: View synthetic monitoring pages. Add, edit, and delete monitors. For more fine-grained control, you can enable the optional permissions system. The permissions system allows you to manage the level of access for users to view and edit within synthetic monitoring (for example, monitors and private locations).",

      "body": "You can use New Relic's containerized private minions (CPM). These are Docker container-based private minions that accept and execute synthetic monitors against your private locations. The CPM can operate in a Docker container system environment or a Kubernetes container orchestration system environment. The CPM will auto-detect its environment to select the appropriate operating mode. General private minion features Because the CPM operates as a container instead of a virtual machine, it delivers many features: Easy to install, start, and update Runs on: Linux macOS Windows Enhanced security and support for non-root user execution Ability to leverage a Docker container as a sandbox environment Customizable monitor check timeout Custom provided modules for scripted monitor types Kubernetes-specific features Also, the CPM delivers the following features in a Kubernetes environment: Integrates with the Kubernetes API to delegate runtime lifecycle management to Kubernetes Does not require privileged access to the Docker socket Supports hosted and on-premise Kubernetes clusters Supports various container engines such as Docker and Containerd Deployable via Helm charts as well as configuration YAMLs Allows job (ping vs. non-ping checks) based resource allocation for optimum resource management Observability offered via the New Relic One Kubernetes cluster explorer System requirements and compatibility To host CPMs, your system must meet the minimum requirements for the chosen system environment. Caution Do not modify any CPM files. New Relic is not liable for any modifications you make. For more information, contact your account representative or a New Relic technical sales rep. Docker container system environment requirements Compatibility for Requirements Operating system Linux kernel: 3.10 or higher. macOS: 10.11 or higher. Windows: Windows 10 64-bit or higher. You must also configure Docker to run Linux containers in order for CPMs to work on Windows systems. Processor A modern, multi-core CPU Memory 2.5 GiB of RAM per CPU core (dedicated) Disk space A minimum of 10 GB per host Docker version Docker 17.12.1-ce or higher Private location key You must have a private location key Caution The Docker CPM is not designed for use with container orchestrators like AWS ECS, Docker Swarm, Apache Mesos, Azure Container Instances, etc. Running the Docker CPM in a container orchestrator will result in unexpected issues because it is itself a container orchestrator. If you're using container orchestration, see our Kubernetes CPM requirements. Kubernetes container orchestration system environment requirements (CPM v3.0.0 or higher) Compatibility for Requirements Operating system Linux kernel: 3.10 or higher macOS: 10.11 or higher Windows: Windows 10 64-bit or higher Processor A modern, multi-core CPU Minion pod CPU (vCPU/Core): 0.5 up to 0.75 Memory: 800 Mi up to 1.6 Gi Resources allocated to a Minion pod are user configurable. Runner pod CPU (vCPU/Core): 0.5 up to 1 Memory: 1.25 Gi up to 3 Gi For a scripted API check, 1.25 Gi will be requested with a limit of 2.5 Gi. For a simple browser or scripted browser check, 2 Gi will be requested with a limit of 3 Gi. Additional considerations: Resources allocated to a runner pod are not user configurable. The maximum limit-request resource ratio for both CPU and memory is 2. Disk space Persistent volume (PV) of at least 10 Gi in size Note that if a ReadWriteOnce (RWO) PV is provided to the minion, an implicit node affinity will be established to ensure the minion and the runner containers are scheduled on the same node. This is required to allow the minion and the associated runners access to the PV, as an RWO PV can be accessed only by a single node in the cluster. Kubernetes version We recommend that your Kubernetes cluster supports Kubernetes v1.15. Caution We have identified a compatibility issue with Kubernetes v1.21+. A workaround is available by disabling the BoundServiceAccountTokenVolume feature gate on the cluster. Private location key You must have a private location key Helm Follow installation instructions for Helm v3 for your OS. Kubectl Follow installation instructions for Kubectl for your OS. To view versions, dependencies, default values for how many runner pods start with each minion, the Persistent volume access mode, and more, please see Show help and examples below. Private location key Before launching CPMs, you must have a private location key. Your CPM uses the key to authenticate against New Relic and run monitors associated with that private location. To find the key for existing private location: Go to one.newrelic.com > Synthetics > Private locations. In the Private locations index, locate the private location you want your CPM to be assigned to. Note the key associated with the private location with the key icon. Sandboxing and Docker dependencies Sandboxing and Docker dependencies are applicable to the CPM in a Docker container system environment. Docker dependencies The CPM runs in Docker and is able to leverage Docker as a sandboxing technology. This ensures complete isolation of the monitor execution, which improves security, reliability, and repeatability. Every time a scripted or browser monitor is executed, the CPM creates a brand new Docker container to run it in called a runner. The minion container needs to be configured to communicate with the Docker engine in order to spawn additional runner containers. Each spawned container is then dedicated to run a check associated with the synthetic monitor running on the private location the minion container is associated with. There are two crucial dependencies at launch. To enable sandboxing, ensure that: Your writable and executable directory is mounted at /tmp. The writable directory can be any directory you want the CPM to write into, but New Relic recommends the system's own /tmp to make things easy. Your writable Docker UNIX socket is mounted at /var/run/docker.sock or DOCKER_HOST environment variable. For more information, see Docker's Daemon socket option. Caution Core count on the host determines how many runner containers the CPM can run concurrently on the host. Since memory requirements are scaled to the expected count of runner containers, we recommend not running multiple CPMs on the same host to avoid resource contention. For additional information on sandboxing and running as a root or non-root user, see Security, sandboxing, and running as non-root. Install and update CPM versions Both installing and updating the CPM use the same command to pull the latest Docker image from the Quay.io repository where the CPM Docker image is hosted. Go to quay.io/repository/newrelic/synthetics-minion for a list of all the releases. CPM images are also hosted on Docker Hub. Go to hub.docker.com/r/newrelic/synthetics-minion/tags for a list of all the releases. Unless hosting the images in a local image repository, connections to either quay.io or docker.io will need to be allowed through your firewall in order for Docker to pull the synthetics-minion and synthetics-minion-runner images. The \"runner\" image is pulled automatically on startup of the synthetics-minion container. See Docker environment configuration and Kubernetes environment configuration for details on how to set a local repository and the runner registry endpoint. Start the CPM To start the CPM, follow the applicable Docker or Kubernetes instructions. Docker start procedure Locate your private location key. Ensure you've enabled Docker dependencies for sandboxing and installed CPM on your system. Run the appropriate script for your system. Tailor the common defaults for /tmp and /var/run/docker.sock in the following examples to match your system. Linux/macOS: docker run \\ --name YOUR_CONTAINER_NAME \\ -e \"MINION_PRIVATE_LOCATION_KEY=YOUR_PRIVATE_LOCATION_KEY\" \\ -v /tmp:/tmp:rw \\ -v /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock:rw \\ -d \\ --restart unless-stopped \\ quay.io/newrelic/synthetics-minion:latest Copy Windows: docker run ^ --name YOUR_CONTAINER_NAME ^ -e \"MINION_PRIVATE_LOCATION_KEY=YOUR_PRIVATE_LOCATION_KEY\" ^ -v /tmp:/tmp:rw ^ -v /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock:rw ^ -d ^ --restart unless-stopped ^ quay.io/newrelic/synthetics-minion:latest Copy View the logs for your minion container: docker logs --follow YOUR_CONTAINER_NAME Copy When a message similar to Synthetics Minion is ready and servicing location YOUR_PRIVATE_LOCATION_LABEL appears, your CPM is up and ready to run monitors assigned to that location. Kubernetes start procedure Locate your private location key. Set up the a namespace for the CPM in your Kubernetes cluster: kubectl create namespace YOUR_NAMESPACE Copy Copy the Helm charts from the New Relic Helm repo. If you are copying the charts for the first time: helm repo add YOUR_REPO_NAME https://helm-charts.newrelic.com Copy If you previously copied the Helm charts from the New Relic Helm repo, then get the latest: helm repo update Copy Install the CPM with the following Helm command: For a fresh installation of the CPM: helm install YOUR_CPM_NAME YOUR_REPO_NAME/synthetics-minion -n YOUR_NAMESPACE --set synthetics.privateLocationKey=YOUR_PRIVATE_LOCATION_KEY Copy To update an existing CPM installation: helm upgrade YOUR_CPM_NAME YOUR_REPO_NAME/synthetics-minion -n YOUR_NAMESPACE --set synthetics.privateLocationKey=YOUR_PRIVATE_LOCATION_KEY Copy Check if the minion pod is up and running: kubectl get -n YOUR_NAMESPACE pods Copy Once the status attribute of each pod is shown as running, your CPM is up and ready to run monitors assigned to your private location. Stop or delete the CPM On a Docker container system environment, use the Docker stop procedure to stop the CPM from running. On a Kubernetes container orchestration system environment, use the Kubernetes delete procedure to stop the CPM from running. Docker stop procedure You can stop a Docker container either by the container name, or the container ID. Container name stop for Linux, macOS, and Windows: docker stop YOUR_CONTAINER_NAME docker rm YOUR_CONTAINER_NAME Copy Container ID stop for Linux/macOS: In the examples the container is stopped and removed. To only stop the container, omit docker rm $CONTAINER_ID. CONTAINER_ID=$(docker ps -aqf name=YOUR_CONTAINER_NAME) docker stop $CONTAINER_ID docker rm $CONTAINER_ID Copy Container ID stop for Windows: In the examples the container is stopped and removed. To only stop the container, omit docker rm $CONTAINER_ID. FOR /F \"tokens=*\" %%CID IN ('docker ps -aqf name=YOUR_CONTAINER_NAME') do (SET CONTAINER_ID=%%CID) docker stop %CONTAINER_ID% docker rm %CONTAINER_ID% Copy Kubernetes delete procedure Get the MINION_POD_INSTALLATION_NAME of the minion pod you want to delete: helm list -n YOUR_NAMESPACE Copy Delete the minion pod: helm uninstall -n YOUR_NAMESPACE MINION_POD_INSTALLATION_NAME Copy Delete the namespace set up for the CPM in your Kubernetes cluster: kubectl delete namespace YOUR_NAMESPACE Copy Show help and examples Use these options as applicable: To get a list of the most commonly used run options directly in the command line interface, run the show help command. To show CPM usage examples as well as the list of all the available run options, run this command: docker run quay.io/newrelic/synthetics-minion:latest help Copy To keep track of Docker logs and verify the health of your monitors, see Containerized private minion (CPM) maintenance and monitoring. For a CPM in the Kubernetes container orchestration system environment, the following Helm show commands can be used to view the chart.yaml and the values.yaml, respectively: helm show chart YOUR_REPO_NAME/synthetics-minion Copy helm show values YOUR_REPO_NAME/synthetics-minion Copy Show license information To show the licensing information for the open source software that we use in the CPM, run the LICENSE command. Run this command to view license information for CPM versions 2.2.27 or higher: docker run quay.io/newrelic/synthetics-minion:latest LICENSE Copy Some of our open-source software is listed under multiple software licenses, and in that case we have listed the license we've chosen to use. Our license information is also available in the our licenses documentation. Configure CPM You can configure the containerized private minion with custom npm modules, preserve data between launches, use environment variables, and more. For more information, see CPM configuration. Networks For both Docker and Kubernetes, the CPM and its runner containers will inherit network settings from the host. For an example of this on a Docker container system environment, see the Docker site. A new bridge network is created for each runner container. This means networking command options like --network and --dns passed to the CPM container at launch (such as through Docker run commands on a Docker container system environment) are not inherited or used by the runner containers. When these networks are created, they pull from the default IP address pool configured for daemon. For an example of this on a Docker container system environment, see the Docker site. Typically, the runner network is removed after the check is completed. However, if a CPM exits while a check is still running, or exits in another unexpected circumstance, these networks may get orphaned. This can potentially use up IP address space that is available to the Docker daemon. If this happens, you may see INTERNAL ENGINE ERROR code: 31 entries in your CPM logging when trying to create a new runner container. To clean these up in Docker container system environments only, run docker network prune. Security, sandboxing, and running as non-root By default, the software running inside a CPM is executed with root user privileges. This is suitable for most scenarios, as the execution is sandboxed. In a Docker container system environment: To change the default AppArmor profile used by containers that CPM spawns to run monitors, see the environment variable MINION_RUNNER_APPARMOR (CPM version 3.0.3 or higher) or MINION_DOCKER_RUNNER_APPARMOR (CPM version up to v3.0.2). To run the CPM as a non-root user, additional steps are required: Run as non-root user for Docker For more information, see Docker's official documentation about security and AppArmor security profiles. If your environment requires you to run the CPM as a non-root user, follow this procedure. In the following example, the non-root user is my_user. Ensure that my_user can use the Docker engine on the host: Verify that my_user belongs to the \"docker\" system group. OR Enable the Docker TCP socket option, and pass the DOCKER_HOST environment variable to CPM. Verify that my_user has read/write permissions to all the directories and volumes passed to CPM. To set these permission, use the chmod command. Get the uid of my_user for use in the run command: id -u my_user. Once these conditions are met, use the option \"-u <uid>:<gid>\" when launching CPM: docker run ... -u 1002 ... Copy OR docker run ... -u 1002 -e DOCKER_HOST=http://localhost:2375 ... Copy Docker image repository A single CPM Docker image serves both the Docker container system environment and Kubernetes container orchestration system environment. The Docker image is hosted on quay.io. To make sure your Docker image is up-to-date, see the quay.io newrelic/synthetics-minion repository. Additional considerations for CPM connection Connection Description CPMs without Internet access A CPM can operate without access to the internet, but with some exceptions. The public internet health check can be disabled using the environment variables named MINION_NETWORK_HEALTHCHECK_DISABLED for a Docker container system environment or synthetics.minionNetworkHealthCheckDisabled for a Kubernetes container orchestration system environment. The CPM needs to be able to contact the \"synthetics-horde.nr-data.net\" domain. This is necessary for it to report data to New Relic and to receive monitors to execute. Ask your network administration if this is a problem and how to set up exceptions. Communicate with Synthetics via a proxy To set up communication with New Relic by proxy, use the environment variables named MINION_API_PROXY*. Arguments passed at launch This applies to a Docker container environment only. Arguments passed to the CPM container at launch do not get passed on to the containers spawned by the CPM. Docker has no concept of \"inheritance\" or a \"hierarchy\" of containers, and we don't copy the configuration that is passed from CPM to the monitor-running containers. The only shared configuration between them is the one set at the Docker daemon level.",

      "body": "Read on to learn how to configure your containerized private minion (CPM). You can do the following to customize your CPMs: Set up custom modules for scripted browsers in New Relic. Preserve launch data with permanent data storage. Use environment variables in your configuration. You may not modify any CPM files and New Relic is not liable for any modifications you make. Guidelines for mounting volumes All directories and files must be assigned group ownership as 3729 with read/write permissions. This ensures that the Runner, which uses uid: 1000 and gid: 3729, has access to all the mounted volumes. However, the Minion is able to run as root (uid: 0) or with any uid between the range of [2000, 4000], inclusive. For more information, see running as non-root in Kubernetes or Docker. Docker Directories are mounted onto a container as volumes by specifying a -v argument within docker run For example, docker run ... -v /path/to/src:/path/to/dest:rw Kubernetes It is possible to add a directory onto a persistent volume (PV) by using kubectl cp. However, alternative approaches are supported as long as the file permissions are set appropriately. For example, kubectl cp /path/to/src <POD_NAME>:/path/to/dest will add a directory onto each PV in the specified pod Each PV must have a separate copy of the directories. For example, a cluster with n Minion replicas must have n PVs, each with their own copy of directories The directories and files must be added prior to the Minion boot up, otherwise the Minion must be restarted to detect the updates Custom npm modules Custom npm modules are exclusive to the CPM. They allow you to provide an arbitrary set of npm modules, and make them available for scripted monitors in Synthetics. To set up the modules: Create a directory which contains a package.json, following the npm official guidelines, in the root of the directory. Anything contained in the dependencies field will be installed by the CPM at start, and made available when running monitors on that private minion. Optionally, you can override the root level package.json with a Node version-specific directory. This allows a script to be updated per monitor runtime if a Node version of a runtime is no longer compatible with your dependencies. See an example of this below. Custom module directory In this example, a custom module directory is used with the following structure: /example-custom-modules-dir/ ├── counter │ ├── index.js │ └── package.json └── package.json ⇦ the only mandatory file Copy The package.json defines dependencies as both a local module (for example, counter) and an npm hosted modules (for example, async version ^2.6.1): { \"name\": \"custom-modules\", \"version\": \"1.0.0\", ⇦ optional \"description\": \"example custom modules directory\", ⇦ optional \"dependencies\": { \"async\": \"^2.6.1\", ⇦ npm hosted module \"counter\": \"file:./counter\" ⇦ Local module } } Copy Node version-specific overrides You can declare a package.json per Node version that will override the root level package.json. This allows a monitor script to be updated per monitor runtime in the event that the Node version of a runtime is no longer compatible with your dependencies. As shown in the first example, local modules can still be defined within a version specific directory. If a package.json is not defined for a specific Node version, then the root level package.json will be used to install dependencies. In this example, a custom module directory is used with the following structure: /example-custom-modules-dir/ ├── 6.11.2 ⇦ optional Node specific directory │ └── package.json └── 10.15.0 ⇦ optional Node specific directory │ └── package.json ├── counter │ ├── index.js │ └── package.json └── package.json ⇦ the only mandatory file ​ Copy Once you create the custom modules directory and the package.json you can apply it to your CPM for Docker and Kubernetes. Docker For Docker, launch CPM mounting the directory at /var/lib/newrelic/synthetics/modules. For example: docker run ... -v /example-custom-modules-dir:/var/lib/newrelic/synthetics/modules:rw ... Copy Kubernetes Complete the following: Launch the CPM, setting a value for the persistence.customModules configuration value either in the command line or in a YAML file during installation. The value should specify the subpath on your Minion's Persistent Volume where your custom modules files exist. For example: helm install ... --set persistence.customModules=<custom-modules-subpath> ... Copy Make sure that your custom modules directory is available on the Minion Pod. You can use kubectl cp as one method to copy the directory from your host to the Minion. For example: kubectl cp /example-custom-modules-dir <namespace>/<pod_name>:/var/lib/newrelic/synthetics/modules Copy Look at the CPM logs for \"... Initialization of Custom Modules ...\" to see if the modules were installed properly, or if there were any errors. The npm installation logs will be shown. Now you can add \"require('async');\" into the script of monitors you send to this private location. Change package.json for custom modules Along with npm modules, you can also use Node.js modules. To change the custom modules used by your CPM, modify package.json and reboot the CPM. It will detect the change in configuration during the reboot, and then clean up and re-install. Caution Local modules: While your package.json can include any local module, these modules must reside inside the tree under your custom module directory. If stored outside the tree, the initialization process will fail and you will see an error message in the docker logs after launching CPM. Permanent data storage CPM is a stateless application and does not preserve information from prior requests or sessions by default. However, you can preserve data between launches by enabling permanent data storage. For example, you can permanently set how the minion identifies itself (for example, Minion_ID), and use it to associate the data visible in Synthetics and Insights events with the exact minion that produced it. To set permanent data storage on Docker: Create a directory. Launch the CPM, mounting the directory at /var/lib/newrelic/synthetics. Example: docker run ... -v /example-permanent-dir:/var/lib/newrelic/synthetics:rw ... Copy To set permanent data storage on Kubernetes: Launch the CPM, setting a value for the persistence.permanentData configuration value either in the command line or in a YAML file during installation. The value should specify the subpath on your Minion's Persistent Volume where you want the data to be saved. Example: helm install ... --set persistence.permanentData=<permanent-data-subpath> ... Copy User-defined environment variables for scripted monitors Containerized private minions let you configure environment variables for use in scripted monitors. These variables are hosted locally on the CPM and can be accessed via $env.USER_DEFINED_VARIABLES. There are two ways to set user-defined variables: by mounting a JSON file or by supplying an environment variable to the CPM on launch. If both are provided, the CPM will use values provided from the environment only. Mounting JSON file The JSON file must have read permissions and contain a JSON formatted map. Example user-defined variable file: { \"KEY\" : \"VALUE\", \"User_Name\": \"MINION\", \"My_Password\": \"PASSW0RD 1 2 3\", \"my_URL\": \"https://newrelic.com/\", \"ETC\" : \"ETC\" } Copy The file must be available or mounted to the path in your container: /var/lib/newrelic/synthetics/variables/user_defined_variables.json Docker example: docker run ... -v /example-user-defined-variables.json:/var/lib/newrelic/synthetics/variables/user_defined_variables.json:rw ... Copy Kubernetes example: When mounting a JSON file to your Minion Pod in Kubernetes, you can either copy the file directly to the Minion Pod or to a Pod that has access to the same Persistent Volume and Persistent Volume Claim that the Minion will use. After successfully loading the file, you may need to restart your Minion Pod for the change to take effect. kubectl cp path/to/user_defined_variables.json <namespace>/<pod_name>:/var/lib/newrelic/synthetics/variables/user_defined_variables.json Copy Passing as an environment variable Use the -e flag to set up an environment variable named MINION_USER_DEFINED_VARIABLES and give it a value of a JSON formatted map string. docker run ... -e MINION_USER_DEFINED_ENV_VARIABLES='{\"KEY\":\"VALUE\",\"NAME\":\"MINION\",\"ETC\":\"ETC\"}' ... Copy Tip The CPM on Kubernetes does not currently support loading user-defined environment variables via environment variable. You will have to configure your Kubernetes CPM by mounting a JSON file. Accessing user-defined environment variables from scripts To reference a configured user-defined environment variable, use the reserved $env.USER_DEFINED_VARIABLES followed by the name of a given variable with dot notation. For example, $env.USER_DEFINED_VARIABLES.MY_VARIABLE Caution User-defined environment variables are not sanitized from logs. For sensitive information, consider using the secure credentials feature. Environment variables Environmental variables allow you to fine-tune the CPM configuration to meet your specific environmental and functional needs. Docker environment configuration The variables are provided at startup using the -e, --env argument. The following table shows all the environment variables that CPM supports.

      "body": "You can use New Relic's containerized private minions (CPM). These are Docker container-based private minions that accept and execute synthetic monitors against your private locations. The CPM can operate in a Docker container system environment or a Kubernetes container orchestration system environment. The CPM will auto-detect its environment to select the appropriate operating mode. General private minion features Because the CPM operates as a container instead of a virtual machine, it delivers many features: Easy to install, start, and update Runs on: Linux macOS Windows Enhanced security and support for non-root user execution Ability to leverage a Docker container as a sandbox environment Customizable monitor check timeout Custom provided modules for scripted monitor types Kubernetes-specific features Also, the CPM delivers the following features in a Kubernetes environment: Integrates with the Kubernetes API to delegate runtime lifecycle management to Kubernetes Does not require privileged access to the Docker socket Supports hosted and on-premise Kubernetes clusters Supports various container engines such as Docker and Containerd Deployable via Helm charts as well as configuration YAMLs Allows job (ping vs. non-ping checks) based resource allocation for optimum resource management Observability offered via the New Relic One Kubernetes cluster explorer System requirements and compatibility To host CPMs, your system must meet the minimum requirements for the chosen system environment. Caution Do not modify any CPM files. New Relic is not liable for any modifications you make. For more information, contact your account representative or a New Relic technical sales rep. Docker container system environment requirements Compatibility for Requirements Operating system Linux kernel: 3.10 or higher. macOS: 10.11 or higher. Windows: Windows 10 64-bit or higher. You must also configure Docker to run Linux containers in order for CPMs to work on Windows systems. Processor A modern, multi-core CPU Memory 2.5 GiB of RAM per CPU core (dedicated) Disk space A minimum of 10 GB per host Docker version Docker 17.12.1-ce or higher Private location key You must have a private location key Caution The Docker CPM is not designed for use with container orchestrators like AWS ECS, Docker Swarm, Apache Mesos, Azure Container Instances, etc. Running the Docker CPM in a container orchestrator will result in unexpected issues because it is itself a container orchestrator. If you're using container orchestration, see our Kubernetes CPM requirements. Kubernetes container orchestration system environment requirements (CPM v3.0.0 or higher) Compatibility for Requirements Operating system Linux kernel: 3.10 or higher macOS: 10.11 or higher Windows: Windows 10 64-bit or higher Processor A modern, multi-core CPU Minion pod CPU (vCPU/Core): 0.5 up to 0.75 Memory: 800 Mi up to 1.6 Gi Resources allocated to a Minion pod are user configurable. Runner pod CPU (vCPU/Core): 0.5 up to 1 Memory: 1.25 Gi up to 3 Gi For a scripted API check, 1.25 Gi will be requested with a limit of 2.5 Gi. For a simple browser or scripted browser check, 2 Gi will be requested with a limit of 3 Gi. Additional considerations: Resources allocated to a runner pod are not user configurable. The maximum limit-request resource ratio for both CPU and memory is 2. Disk space Persistent volume (PV) of at least 10 Gi in size Note that if a ReadWriteOnce (RWO) PV is provided to the minion, an implicit node affinity will be established to ensure the minion and the runner containers are scheduled on the same node. This is required to allow the minion and the associated runners access to the PV, as an RWO PV can be accessed only by a single node in the cluster. Kubernetes version We recommend that your Kubernetes cluster supports Kubernetes v1.15. Caution We have identified a compatibility issue with Kubernetes v1.21+. A workaround is available by disabling the BoundServiceAccountTokenVolume feature gate on the cluster. Private location key You must have a private location key Helm Follow installation instructions for Helm v3 for your OS. Kubectl Follow installation instructions for Kubectl for your OS. To view versions, dependencies, default values for how many runner pods start with each minion, the Persistent volume access mode, and more, please see Show help and examples below. Private location key Before launching CPMs, you must have a private location key. Your CPM uses the key to authenticate against New Relic and run monitors associated with that private location. To find the key for existing private location: Go to one.newrelic.com > Synthetics > Private locations. In the Private locations index, locate the private location you want your CPM to be assigned to. Note the key associated with the private location with the key icon. Sandboxing and Docker dependencies Sandboxing and Docker dependencies are applicable to the CPM in a Docker container system environment. Docker dependencies The CPM runs in Docker and is able to leverage Docker as a sandboxing technology. This ensures complete isolation of the monitor execution, which improves security, reliability, and repeatability. Every time a scripted or browser monitor is executed, the CPM creates a brand new Docker container to run it in called a runner. The minion container needs to be configured to communicate with the Docker engine in order to spawn additional runner containers. Each spawned container is then dedicated to run a check associated with the synthetic monitor running on the private location the minion container is associated with. There are two crucial dependencies at launch. To enable sandboxing, ensure that: Your writable and executable directory is mounted at /tmp. The writable directory can be any directory you want the CPM to write into, but New Relic recommends the system's own /tmp to make things easy. Your writable Docker UNIX socket is mounted at /var/run/docker.sock or DOCKER_HOST environment variable. For more information, see Docker's Daemon socket option. Caution Core count on the host determines how many runner containers the CPM can run concurrently on the host. Since memory requirements are scaled to the expected count of runner containers, we recommend not running multiple CPMs on the same host to avoid resource contention. For additional information on sandboxing and running as a root or non-root user, see Security, sandboxing, and running as non-root. Install and update CPM versions Both installing and updating the CPM use the same command to pull the latest Docker image from the Quay.io repository where the CPM Docker image is hosted. Go to quay.io/repository/newrelic/synthetics-minion for a list of all the releases. CPM images are also hosted on Docker Hub. Go to hub.docker.com/r/newrelic/synthetics-minion/tags for a list of all the releases. Unless hosting the images in a local image repository, connections to either quay.io or docker.io will need to be allowed through your firewall in order for Docker to pull the synthetics-minion and synthetics-minion-runner images. The \"runner\" image is pulled automatically on startup of the synthetics-minion container. See Docker environment configuration and Kubernetes environment configuration for details on how to set a local repository and the runner registry endpoint. Start the CPM To start the CPM, follow the applicable Docker or Kubernetes instructions. Docker start procedure Locate your private location key. Ensure you've enabled Docker dependencies for sandboxing and installed CPM on your system. Run the appropriate script for your system. Tailor the common defaults for /tmp and /var/run/docker.sock in the following examples to match your system. Linux/macOS: docker run \\ --name YOUR_CONTAINER_NAME \\ -e \"MINION_PRIVATE_LOCATION_KEY=YOUR_PRIVATE_LOCATION_KEY\" \\ -v /tmp:/tmp:rw \\ -v /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock:rw \\ -d \\ --restart unless-stopped \\ quay.io/newrelic/synthetics-minion:latest Copy Windows: docker run ^ --name YOUR_CONTAINER_NAME ^ -e \"MINION_PRIVATE_LOCATION_KEY=YOUR_PRIVATE_LOCATION_KEY\" ^ -v /tmp:/tmp:rw ^ -v /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock:rw ^ -d ^ --restart unless-stopped ^ quay.io/newrelic/synthetics-minion:latest Copy View the logs for your minion container: docker logs --follow YOUR_CONTAINER_NAME Copy When a message similar to Synthetics Minion is ready and servicing location YOUR_PRIVATE_LOCATION_LABEL appears, your CPM is up and ready to run monitors assigned to that location. Kubernetes start procedure Locate your private location key. Set up the a namespace for the CPM in your Kubernetes cluster: kubectl create namespace YOUR_NAMESPACE Copy Copy the Helm charts from the New Relic Helm repo. If you are copying the charts for the first time: helm repo add YOUR_REPO_NAME https://helm-charts.newrelic.com Copy If you previously copied the Helm charts from the New Relic Helm repo, then get the latest: helm repo update Copy Install the CPM with the following Helm command: For a fresh installation of the CPM: helm install YOUR_CPM_NAME YOUR_REPO_NAME/synthetics-minion -n YOUR_NAMESPACE --set synthetics.privateLocationKey=YOUR_PRIVATE_LOCATION_KEY Copy To update an existing CPM installation: helm upgrade YOUR_CPM_NAME YOUR_REPO_NAME/synthetics-minion -n YOUR_NAMESPACE --set synthetics.privateLocationKey=YOUR_PRIVATE_LOCATION_KEY Copy Check if the minion pod is up and running: kubectl get -n YOUR_NAMESPACE pods Copy Once the status attribute of each pod is shown as running, your CPM is up and ready to run monitors assigned to your private location. Stop or delete the CPM On a Docker container system environment, use the Docker stop procedure to stop the CPM from running. On a Kubernetes container orchestration system environment, use the Kubernetes delete procedure to stop the CPM from running. Docker stop procedure You can stop a Docker container either by the container name, or the container ID. Container name stop for Linux, macOS, and Windows: docker stop YOUR_CONTAINER_NAME docker rm YOUR_CONTAINER_NAME Copy Container ID stop for Linux/macOS: In the examples the container is stopped and removed. To only stop the container, omit docker rm $CONTAINER_ID. CONTAINER_ID=$(docker ps -aqf name=YOUR_CONTAINER_NAME) docker stop $CONTAINER_ID docker rm $CONTAINER_ID Copy Container ID stop for Windows: In the examples the container is stopped and removed. To only stop the container, omit docker rm $CONTAINER_ID. FOR /F \"tokens=*\" %%CID IN ('docker ps -aqf name=YOUR_CONTAINER_NAME') do (SET CONTAINER_ID=%%CID) docker stop %CONTAINER_ID% docker rm %CONTAINER_ID% Copy Kubernetes delete procedure Get the MINION_POD_INSTALLATION_NAME of the minion pod you want to delete: helm list -n YOUR_NAMESPACE Copy Delete the minion pod: helm uninstall -n YOUR_NAMESPACE MINION_POD_INSTALLATION_NAME Copy Delete the namespace set up for the CPM in your Kubernetes cluster: kubectl delete namespace YOUR_NAMESPACE Copy Show help and examples Use these options as applicable: To get a list of the most commonly used run options directly in the command line interface, run the show help command. To show CPM usage examples as well as the list of all the available run options, run this command: docker run quay.io/newrelic/synthetics-minion:latest help Copy To keep track of Docker logs and verify the health of your monitors, see Containerized private minion (CPM) maintenance and monitoring. For a CPM in the Kubernetes container orchestration system environment, the following Helm show commands can be used to view the chart.yaml and the values.yaml, respectively: helm show chart YOUR_REPO_NAME/synthetics-minion Copy helm show values YOUR_REPO_NAME/synthetics-minion Copy Show license information To show the licensing information for the open source software that we use in the CPM, run the LICENSE command. Run this command to view license information for CPM versions 2.2.27 or higher: docker run quay.io/newrelic/synthetics-minion:latest LICENSE Copy Some of our open-source software is listed under multiple software licenses, and in that case we have listed the license we've chosen to use. Our license information is also available in the our licenses documentation. Configure CPM You can configure the containerized private minion with custom npm modules, preserve data between launches, use environment variables, and more. For more information, see CPM configuration. Networks For both Docker and Kubernetes, the CPM and its runner containers will inherit network settings from the host. For an example of this on a Docker container system environment, see the Docker site. A new bridge network is created for each runner container. This means networking command options like --network and --dns passed to the CPM container at launch (such as through Docker run commands on a Docker container system environment) are not inherited or used by the runner containers. When these networks are created, they pull from the default IP address pool configured for daemon. For an example of this on a Docker container system environment, see the Docker site. Typically, the runner network is removed after the check is completed. However, if a CPM exits while a check is still running, or exits in another unexpected circumstance, these networks may get orphaned. This can potentially use up IP address space that is available to the Docker daemon. If this happens, you may see INTERNAL ENGINE ERROR code: 31 entries in your CPM logging when trying to create a new runner container. To clean these up in Docker container system environments only, run docker network prune. Security, sandboxing, and running as non-root By default, the software running inside a CPM is executed with root user privileges. This is suitable for most scenarios, as the execution is sandboxed. In a Docker container system environment: To change the default AppArmor profile used by containers that CPM spawns to run monitors, see the environment variable MINION_RUNNER_APPARMOR (CPM version 3.0.3 or higher) or MINION_DOCKER_RUNNER_APPARMOR (CPM version up to v3.0.2). To run the CPM as a non-root user, additional steps are required: Run as non-root user for Docker For more information, see Docker's official documentation about security and AppArmor security profiles. If your environment requires you to run the CPM as a non-root user, follow this procedure. In the following example, the non-root user is my_user. Ensure that my_user can use the Docker engine on the host: Verify that my_user belongs to the \"docker\" system group. OR Enable the Docker TCP socket option, and pass the DOCKER_HOST environment variable to CPM. Verify that my_user has read/write permissions to all the directories and volumes passed to CPM. To set these permission, use the chmod command. Get the uid of my_user for use in the run command: id -u my_user. Once these conditions are met, use the option \"-u <uid>:<gid>\" when launching CPM: docker run ... -u 1002 ... Copy OR docker run ... -u 1002 -e DOCKER_HOST=http://localhost:2375 ... Copy Docker image repository A single CPM Docker image serves both the Docker container system environment and Kubernetes container orchestration system environment. The Docker image is hosted on quay.io. To make sure your Docker image is up-to-date, see the quay.io newrelic/synthetics-minion repository. Additional considerations for CPM connection Connection Description CPMs without Internet access A CPM can operate without access to the internet, but with some exceptions. The public internet health check can be disabled using the environment variables named MINION_NETWORK_HEALTHCHECK_DISABLED for a Docker container system environment or synthetics.minionNetworkHealthCheckDisabled for a Kubernetes container orchestration system environment. The CPM needs to be able to contact the \"synthetics-horde.nr-data.net\" domain. This is necessary for it to report data to New Relic and to receive monitors to execute. Ask your network administration if this is a problem and how to set up exceptions. Communicate with Synthetics via a proxy To set up communication with New Relic by proxy, use the environment variables named MINION_API_PROXY*. Arguments passed at launch This applies to a Docker container environment only. Arguments passed to the CPM container at launch do not get passed on to the containers spawned by the CPM. Docker has no concept of \"inheritance\" or a \"hierarchy\" of containers, and we don't copy the configuration that is passed from CPM to the monitor-running containers. The only shared configuration between them is the one set at the Docker daemon level.",

      "body": "Read on to learn how to configure your containerized private minion (CPM). You can do the following to customize your CPMs: Set up custom modules for scripted browsers in New Relic. Preserve launch data with permanent data storage. Use environment variables in your configuration. You may not modify any CPM files and New Relic is not liable for any modifications you make. Guidelines for mounting volumes All directories and files must be assigned group ownership as 3729 with read/write permissions. This ensures that the Runner, which uses uid: 1000 and gid: 3729, has access to all the mounted volumes. However, the Minion is able to run as root (uid: 0) or with any uid between the range of [2000, 4000], inclusive. For more information, see running as non-root in Kubernetes or Docker. Docker Directories are mounted onto a container as volumes by specifying a -v argument within docker run For example, docker run ... -v /path/to/src:/path/to/dest:rw Kubernetes It is possible to add a directory onto a persistent volume (PV) by using kubectl cp. However, alternative approaches are supported as long as the file permissions are set appropriately. For example, kubectl cp /path/to/src <POD_NAME>:/path/to/dest will add a directory onto each PV in the specified pod Each PV must have a separate copy of the directories. For example, a cluster with n Minion replicas must have n PVs, each with their own copy of directories The directories and files must be added prior to the Minion boot up, otherwise the Minion must be restarted to detect the updates Custom npm modules Custom npm modules are exclusive to the CPM. They allow you to provide an arbitrary set of npm modules, and make them available for scripted monitors in Synthetics. To set up the modules: Create a directory which contains a package.json, following the npm official guidelines, in the root of the directory. Anything contained in the dependencies field will be installed by the CPM at start, and made available when running monitors on that private minion. Optionally, you can override the root level package.json with a Node version-specific directory. This allows a script to be updated per monitor runtime if a Node version of a runtime is no longer compatible with your dependencies. See an example of this below. Custom module directory In this example, a custom module directory is used with the following structure: /example-custom-modules-dir/ ├── counter │ ├── index.js │ └── package.json └── package.json ⇦ the only mandatory file Copy The package.json defines dependencies as both a local module (for example, counter) and an npm hosted modules (for example, async version ^2.6.1): { \"name\": \"custom-modules\", \"version\": \"1.0.0\", ⇦ optional \"description\": \"example custom modules directory\", ⇦ optional \"dependencies\": { \"async\": \"^2.6.1\", ⇦ npm hosted module \"counter\": \"file:./counter\" ⇦ Local module } } Copy Node version-specific overrides You can declare a package.json per Node version that will override the root level package.json. This allows a monitor script to be updated per monitor runtime in the event that the Node version of a runtime is no longer compatible with your dependencies. As shown in the first example, local modules can still be defined within a version specific directory. If a package.json is not defined for a specific Node version, then the root level package.json will be used to install dependencies. In this example, a custom module directory is used with the following structure: /example-custom-modules-dir/ ├── 6.11.2 ⇦ optional Node specific directory │ └── package.json └── 10.15.0 ⇦ optional Node specific directory │ └── package.json ├── counter │ ├── index.js │ └── package.json └── package.json ⇦ the only mandatory file ​ Copy Once you create the custom modules directory and the package.json you can apply it to your CPM for Docker and Kubernetes. Docker For Docker, launch CPM mounting the directory at /var/lib/newrelic/synthetics/modules. For example: docker run ... -v /example-custom-modules-dir:/var/lib/newrelic/synthetics/modules:rw ... Copy Kubernetes Complete the following: Launch the CPM, setting a value for the persistence.customModules configuration value either in the command line or in a YAML file during installation. The value should specify the subpath on your Minion's Persistent Volume where your custom modules files exist. For example: helm install ... --set persistence.customModules=<custom-modules-subpath> ... Copy Make sure that your custom modules directory is available on the Minion Pod. You can use kubectl cp as one method to copy the directory from your host to the Minion. For example: kubectl cp /example-custom-modules-dir <namespace>/<pod_name>:/var/lib/newrelic/synthetics/modules Copy Look at the CPM logs for \"... Initialization of Custom Modules ...\" to see if the modules were installed properly, or if there were any errors. The npm installation logs will be shown. Now you can add \"require('async');\" into the script of monitors you send to this private location. Change package.json for custom modules Along with npm modules, you can also use Node.js modules. To change the custom modules used by your CPM, modify package.json and reboot the CPM. It will detect the change in configuration during the reboot, and then clean up and re-install. Caution Local modules: While your package.json can include any local module, these modules must reside inside the tree under your custom module directory. If stored outside the tree, the initialization process will fail and you will see an error message in the docker logs after launching CPM. Permanent data storage CPM is a stateless application and does not preserve information from prior requests or sessions by default. However, you can preserve data between launches by enabling permanent data storage. For example, you can permanently set how the minion identifies itself (for example, Minion_ID), and use it to associate the data visible in Synthetics and Insights events with the exact minion that produced it. To set permanent data storage on Docker: Create a directory. Launch the CPM, mounting the directory at /var/lib/newrelic/synthetics. Example: docker run ... -v /example-permanent-dir:/var/lib/newrelic/synthetics:rw ... Copy To set permanent data storage on Kubernetes: Launch the CPM, setting a value for the persistence.permanentData configuration value either in the command line or in a YAML file during installation. The value should specify the subpath on your Minion's Persistent Volume where you want the data to be saved. Example: helm install ... --set persistence.permanentData=<permanent-data-subpath> ... Copy User-defined environment variables for scripted monitors Containerized private minions let you configure environment variables for use in scripted monitors. These variables are hosted locally on the CPM and can be accessed via $env.USER_DEFINED_VARIABLES. There are two ways to set user-defined variables: by mounting a JSON file or by supplying an environment variable to the CPM on launch. If both are provided, the CPM will use values provided from the environment only. Mounting JSON file The JSON file must have read permissions and contain a JSON formatted map. Example user-defined variable file: { \"KEY\" : \"VALUE\", \"User_Name\": \"MINION\", \"My_Password\": \"PASSW0RD 1 2 3\", \"my_URL\": \"https://newrelic.com/\", \"ETC\" : \"ETC\" } Copy The file must be available or mounted to the path in your container: /var/lib/newrelic/synthetics/variables/user_defined_variables.json Docker example: docker run ... -v /example-user-defined-variables.json:/var/lib/newrelic/synthetics/variables/user_defined_variables.json:rw ... Copy Kubernetes example: When mounting a JSON file to your Minion Pod in Kubernetes, you can either copy the file directly to the Minion Pod or to a Pod that has access to the same Persistent Volume and Persistent Volume Claim that the Minion will use. After successfully loading the file, you may need to restart your Minion Pod for the change to take effect. kubectl cp path/to/user_defined_variables.json <namespace>/<pod_name>:/var/lib/newrelic/synthetics/variables/user_defined_variables.json Copy Passing as an environment variable Use the -e flag to set up an environment variable named MINION_USER_DEFINED_VARIABLES and give it a value of a JSON formatted map string. docker run ... -e MINION_USER_DEFINED_ENV_VARIABLES='{\"KEY\":\"VALUE\",\"NAME\":\"MINION\",\"ETC\":\"ETC\"}' ... Copy Tip The CPM on Kubernetes does not currently support loading user-defined environment variables via environment variable. You will have to configure your Kubernetes CPM by mounting a JSON file. Accessing user-defined environment variables from scripts To reference a configured user-defined environment variable, use the reserved $env.USER_DEFINED_VARIABLES followed by the name of a given variable with dot notation. For example, $env.USER_DEFINED_VARIABLES.MY_VARIABLE Caution User-defined environment variables are not sanitized from logs. For sensitive information, consider using the secure credentials feature.

      "body": "You can use New Relic's containerized private minions (CPM). These are Docker container-based private minions that accept and execute synthetic monitors against your private locations. The CPM can operate in a Docker container system environment or a Kubernetes container orchestration system environment. The CPM will auto-detect its environment to select the appropriate operating mode. General private minion features Because the CPM operates as a container instead of a virtual machine, it delivers many features: Easy to install, start, and update Runs on: Linux macOS Windows Enhanced security and support for non-root user execution Ability to leverage a Docker container as a sandbox environment Customizable monitor check timeout Custom provided modules for scripted monitor types Kubernetes-specific features Also, the CPM delivers the following features in a Kubernetes environment: Integrates with the Kubernetes API to delegate runtime lifecycle management to Kubernetes Does not require privileged access to the Docker socket Supports hosted and on-premise Kubernetes clusters Supports various container engines such as Docker and Containerd Deployable via Helm charts as well as configuration YAMLs Allows job (ping vs. non-ping checks) based resource allocation for optimum resource management Observability offered via the New Relic One Kubernetes cluster explorer System requirements and compatibility To host CPMs, your system must meet the minimum requirements for the chosen system environment. Caution Do not modify any CPM files. New Relic is not liable for any modifications you make. For more information, contact your account representative or a New Relic technical sales rep. Docker container system environment requirements Compatibility for Requirements Operating system Linux kernel: 3.10 or higher. macOS: 10.11 or higher. Windows: Windows 10 64-bit or higher. You must also configure Docker to run Linux containers in order for CPMs to work on Windows systems. Processor A modern, multi-core CPU Memory 2.5 GiB of RAM per CPU core (dedicated) Disk space A minimum of 10 GB per host Docker version Docker 17.12.1-ce or higher Private location key You must have a private location key Caution The Docker CPM is not designed for use with container orchestrators like AWS ECS, Docker Swarm, Apache Mesos, Azure Container Instances, etc. Running the Docker CPM in a container orchestrator will result in unexpected issues because it is itself a container orchestrator. If you're using container orchestration, see our Kubernetes CPM requirements. Kubernetes container orchestration system environment requirements (CPM v3.0.0 or higher) Compatibility for Requirements Operating system Linux kernel: 3.10 or higher macOS: 10.11 or higher Windows: Windows 10 64-bit or higher Processor A modern, multi-core CPU Minion pod CPU (vCPU/Core): 0.5 up to 0.75 Memory: 800 Mi up to 1.6 Gi Resources allocated to a Minion pod are user configurable. Runner pod CPU (vCPU/Core): 0.5 up to 1 Memory: 1.25 Gi up to 3 Gi For a scripted API check, 1.25 Gi will be requested with a limit of 2.5 Gi. For a simple browser or scripted browser check, 2 Gi will be requested with a limit of 3 Gi. Additional considerations: Resources allocated to a runner pod are not user configurable. The maximum limit-request resource ratio for both CPU and memory is 2. Disk space Persistent volume (PV) of at least 10 Gi in size Note that if a ReadWriteOnce (RWO) PV is provided to the minion, an implicit node affinity will be established to ensure the minion and the runner containers are scheduled on the same node. This is required to allow the minion and the associated runners access to the PV, as an RWO PV can be accessed only by a single node in the cluster. Kubernetes version We recommend that your Kubernetes cluster supports Kubernetes v1.15. Caution We have identified a compatibility issue with Kubernetes v1.21+. A workaround is available by disabling the BoundServiceAccountTokenVolume feature gate on the cluster. Private location key You must have a private location key Helm Follow installation instructions for Helm v3 for your OS. Kubectl Follow installation instructions for Kubectl for your OS. To view versions, dependencies, default values for how many runner pods start with each minion, the Persistent volume access mode, and more, please see Show help and examples below. Private location key Before launching CPMs, you must have a private location key. Your CPM uses the key to authenticate against New Relic and run monitors associated with that private location. To find the key for existing private location: Go to one.newrelic.com > Synthetics > Private locations. In the Private locations index, locate the private location you want your CPM to be assigned to. Note the key associated with the private location with the key icon. Sandboxing and Docker dependencies Sandboxing and Docker dependencies are applicable to the CPM in a Docker container system environment. Docker dependencies The CPM runs in Docker and is able to leverage Docker as a sandboxing technology. This ensures complete isolation of the monitor execution, which improves security, reliability, and repeatability. Every time a scripted or browser monitor is executed, the CPM creates a brand new Docker container to run it in called a runner. The minion container needs to be configured to communicate with the Docker engine in order to spawn additional runner containers. Each spawned container is then dedicated to run a check associated with the synthetic monitor running on the private location the minion container is associated with. There are two crucial dependencies at launch. To enable sandboxing, ensure that: Your writable and executable directory is mounted at /tmp. The writable directory can be any directory you want the CPM to write into, but New Relic recommends the system's own /tmp to make things easy. Your writable Docker UNIX socket is mounted at /var/run/docker.sock or DOCKER_HOST environment variable. For more information, see Docker's Daemon socket option. Caution Core count on the host determines how many runner containers the CPM can run concurrently on the host. Since memory requirements are scaled to the expected count of runner containers, we recommend not running multiple CPMs on the same host to avoid resource contention. For additional information on sandboxing and running as a root or non-root user, see Security, sandboxing, and running as non-root. Install and update CPM versions Both installing and updating the CPM use the same command to pull the latest Docker image from the Quay.io repository where the CPM Docker image is hosted. Go to quay.io/repository/newrelic/synthetics-minion for a list of all the releases. CPM images are also hosted on Docker Hub. Go to hub.docker.com/r/newrelic/synthetics-minion/tags for a list of all the releases. Unless hosting the images in a local image repository, connections to either quay.io or docker.io will need to be allowed through your firewall in order for Docker to pull the synthetics-minion and synthetics-minion-runner images. The \"runner\" image is pulled automatically on startup of the synthetics-minion container. See Docker environment configuration and Kubernetes environment configuration for details on how to set a local repository and the runner registry endpoint. Start the CPM To start the CPM, follow the applicable Docker or Kubernetes instructions. Docker start procedure Locate your private location key. Ensure you've enabled Docker dependencies for sandboxing and installed CPM on your system. Run the appropriate script for your system. Tailor the common defaults for /tmp and /var/run/docker.sock in the following examples to match your system. Linux/macOS: docker run \\ --name YOUR_CONTAINER_NAME \\ -e \"MINION_PRIVATE_LOCATION_KEY=YOUR_PRIVATE_LOCATION_KEY\" \\ -v /tmp:/tmp:rw \\ -v /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock:rw \\ -d \\ --restart unless-stopped \\ quay.io/newrelic/synthetics-minion:latest Copy Windows: docker run ^ --name YOUR_CONTAINER_NAME ^ -e \"MINION_PRIVATE_LOCATION_KEY=YOUR_PRIVATE_LOCATION_KEY\" ^ -v /tmp:/tmp:rw ^ -v /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock:rw ^ -d ^ --restart unless-stopped ^ quay.io/newrelic/synthetics-minion:latest Copy View the logs for your minion container: docker logs --follow YOUR_CONTAINER_NAME Copy When a message similar to Synthetics Minion is ready and servicing location YOUR_PRIVATE_LOCATION_LABEL appears, your CPM is up and ready to run monitors assigned to that location. Kubernetes start procedure Locate your private location key. Set up the a namespace for the CPM in your Kubernetes cluster: kubectl create namespace YOUR_NAMESPACE Copy Copy the Helm charts from the New Relic Helm repo. If you are copying the charts for the first time: helm repo add YOUR_REPO_NAME https://helm-charts.newrelic.com Copy If you previously copied the Helm charts from the New Relic Helm repo, then get the latest: helm repo update Copy Install the CPM with the following Helm command: For a fresh installation of the CPM: helm install YOUR_CPM_NAME YOUR_REPO_NAME/synthetics-minion -n YOUR_NAMESPACE --set synthetics.privateLocationKey=YOUR_PRIVATE_LOCATION_KEY Copy To update an existing CPM installation: helm upgrade YOUR_CPM_NAME YOUR_REPO_NAME/synthetics-minion -n YOUR_NAMESPACE --set synthetics.privateLocationKey=YOUR_PRIVATE_LOCATION_KEY Copy Check if the minion pod is up and running: kubectl get -n YOUR_NAMESPACE pods Copy Once the status attribute of each pod is shown as running, your CPM is up and ready to run monitors assigned to your private location. Stop or delete the CPM On a Docker container system environment, use the Docker stop procedure to stop the CPM from running. On a Kubernetes container orchestration system environment, use the Kubernetes delete procedure to stop the CPM from running. Docker stop procedure You can stop a Docker container either by the container name, or the container ID. Container name stop for Linux, macOS, and Windows: docker stop YOUR_CONTAINER_NAME docker rm YOUR_CONTAINER_NAME Copy Container ID stop for Linux/macOS: In the examples the container is stopped and removed. To only stop the container, omit docker rm $CONTAINER_ID. CONTAINER_ID=$(docker ps -aqf name=YOUR_CONTAINER_NAME) docker stop $CONTAINER_ID docker rm $CONTAINER_ID Copy Container ID stop for Windows: In the examples the container is stopped and removed. To only stop the container, omit docker rm $CONTAINER_ID. FOR /F \"tokens=*\" %%CID IN ('docker ps -aqf name=YOUR_CONTAINER_NAME') do (SET CONTAINER_ID=%%CID) docker stop %CONTAINER_ID% docker rm %CONTAINER_ID% Copy Kubernetes delete procedure Get the MINION_POD_INSTALLATION_NAME of the minion pod you want to delete: helm list -n YOUR_NAMESPACE Copy Delete the minion pod: helm uninstall -n YOUR_NAMESPACE MINION_POD_INSTALLATION_NAME Copy Delete the namespace set up for the CPM in your Kubernetes cluster: kubectl delete namespace YOUR_NAMESPACE Copy Show help and examples Use these options as applicable: To get a list of the most commonly used run options directly in the command line interface, run the show help command. To show CPM usage examples as well as the list of all the available run options, run this command: docker run quay.io/newrelic/synthetics-minion:latest help Copy To keep track of Docker logs and verify the health of your monitors, see Containerized private minion (CPM) maintenance and monitoring. For a CPM in the Kubernetes container orchestration system environment, the following Helm show commands can be used to view the chart.yaml and the values.yaml, respectively: helm show chart YOUR_REPO_NAME/synthetics-minion Copy helm show values YOUR_REPO_NAME/synthetics-minion Copy Show license information To show the licensing information for the open source software that we use in the CPM, run the LICENSE command. Run this command to view license information for CPM versions 2.2.27 or higher: docker run quay.io/newrelic/synthetics-minion:latest LICENSE Copy Some of our open-source software is listed under multiple software licenses, and in that case we have listed the license we've chosen to use. Our license information is also available in the our licenses documentation. Configure CPM You can configure the containerized private minion with custom npm modules, preserve data between launches, use environment variables, and more. For more information, see CPM configuration. Networks For both Docker and Kubernetes, the CPM and its runner containers will inherit network settings from the host. For an example of this on a Docker container system environment, see the Docker site. A new bridge network is created for each runner container. This means networking command options like --network and --dns passed to the CPM container at launch (such as through Docker run commands on a Docker container system environment) are not inherited or used by the runner containers. When these networks are created, they pull from the default IP address pool configured for daemon. For an example of this on a Docker container system environment, see the Docker site. Typically, the runner network is removed after the check is completed. However, if a CPM exits while a check is still running, or exits in another unexpected circumstance, these networks may get orphaned. This can potentially use up IP address space that is available to the Docker daemon. If this happens, you may see INTERNAL ENGINE ERROR code: 31 entries in your CPM logging when trying to create a new runner container. To clean these up in Docker container system environments only, run docker network prune. Security, sandboxing, and running as non-root By default, the software running inside a CPM is executed with root user privileges. This is suitable for most scenarios, as the execution is sandboxed. In a Docker container system environment: To change the default AppArmor profile used by containers that CPM spawns to run monitors, see the environment variable MINION_RUNNER_APPARMOR (CPM version 3.0.3 or higher) or MINION_DOCKER_RUNNER_APPARMOR (CPM version up to v3.0.2). To run the CPM as a non-root user, additional steps are required: Run as non-root user for Docker For more information, see Docker's official documentation about security and AppArmor security profiles. If your environment requires you to run the CPM as a non-root user, follow this procedure. In the following example, the non-root user is my_user. Ensure that my_user can use the Docker engine on the host: Verify that my_user belongs to the \"docker\" system group. OR Enable the Docker TCP socket option, and pass the DOCKER_HOST environment variable to CPM. Verify that my_user has read/write permissions to all the directories and volumes passed to CPM. To set these permission, use the chmod command. Get the uid of my_user for use in the run command: id -u my_user. Once these conditions are met, use the option \"-u <uid>:<gid>\" when launching CPM: docker run ... -u 1002 ... Copy OR docker run ... -u 1002 -e DOCKER_HOST=http://localhost:2375 ... Copy Docker image repository A single CPM Docker image serves both the Docker container system environment and Kubernetes container orchestration system environment. The Docker image is hosted on quay.io. To make sure your Docker image is up-to-date, see the quay.io newrelic/synthetics-minion repository. Additional considerations for CPM connection Connection Description CPMs without Internet access A CPM can operate without access to the internet, but with some exceptions. The public internet health check can be disabled using the environment variables named MINION_NETWORK_HEALTHCHECK_DISABLED for a Docker container system environment or synthetics.minionNetworkHealthCheckDisabled for a Kubernetes container orchestration system environment. The CPM needs to be able to contact the \"synthetics-horde.nr-data.net\" domain. This is necessary for it to report data to New Relic and to receive monitors to execute. Ask your network administration if this is a problem and how to set up exceptions. Communicate with Synthetics via a proxy To set up communication with New Relic by proxy, use the environment variables named MINION_API_PROXY*. Arguments passed at launch This applies to a Docker container environment only. Arguments passed to the CPM container at launch do not get passed on to the containers spawned by the CPM. Docker has no concept of \"inheritance\" or a \"hierarchy\" of containers, and we don't copy the configuration that is passed from CPM to the monitor-running containers. The only shared configuration between them is the one set at the Docker daemon level.",

      "body": "Read on to learn how to configure your containerized private minion (CPM). You can do the following to customize your CPMs: Set up custom modules for scripted browsers in New Relic. Preserve launch data with permanent data storage. Use environment variables in your configuration. You may not modify any CPM files and New Relic is not liable for any modifications you make. Guidelines for mounting volumes All directories and files must be assigned group ownership as 3729 with read/write permissions. This ensures that the Runner, which uses uid: 1000 and gid: 3729, has access to all the mounted volumes. However, the Minion is able to run as root (uid: 0) or with any uid between the range of [2000, 4000], inclusive. For more information, see running as non-root in Kubernetes or Docker. Docker Directories are mounted onto a container as volumes by specifying a -v argument within docker run For example, docker run ... -v /path/to/src:/path/to/dest:rw Kubernetes It is possible to add a directory onto a persistent volume (PV) by using kubectl cp. However, alternative approaches are supported as long as the file permissions are set appropriately. For example, kubectl cp /path/to/src <POD_NAME>:/path/to/dest will add a directory onto each PV in the specified pod Each PV must have a separate copy of the directories. For example, a cluster with n Minion replicas must have n PVs, each with their own copy of directories The directories and files must be added prior to the Minion boot up, otherwise the Minion must be restarted to detect the updates Custom npm modules Custom npm modules are exclusive to the CPM. They allow you to provide an arbitrary set of npm modules, and make them available for scripted monitors in Synthetics. To set up the modules: Create a directory which contains a package.json, following the npm official guidelines, in the root of the directory. Anything contained in the dependencies field will be installed by the CPM at start, and made available when running monitors on that private minion. Optionally, you can override the root level package.json with a Node version-specific directory. This allows a script to be updated per monitor runtime if a Node version of a runtime is no longer compatible with your dependencies. See an example of this below. Custom module directory In this example, a custom module directory is used with the following structure: /example-custom-modules-dir/ ├── counter │ ├── index.js │ └── package.json └── package.json ⇦ the only mandatory file Copy The package.json defines dependencies as both a local module (for example, counter) and an npm hosted modules (for example, async version ^2.6.1): { \"name\": \"custom-modules\", \"version\": \"1.0.0\", ⇦ optional \"description\": \"example custom modules directory\", ⇦ optional \"dependencies\": { \"async\": \"^2.6.1\", ⇦ npm hosted module \"counter\": \"file:./counter\" ⇦ Local module } } Copy Node version-specific overrides You can declare a package.json per Node version that will override the root level package.json. This allows a monitor script to be updated per monitor runtime in the event that the Node version of a runtime is no longer compatible with your dependencies. As shown in the first example, local modules can still be defined within a version specific directory. If a package.json is not defined for a specific Node version, then the root level package.json will be used to install dependencies. In this example, a custom module directory is used with the following structure: /example-custom-modules-dir/ ├── 6.11.2 ⇦ optional Node specific directory │ └── package.json └── 10.15.0 ⇦ optional Node specific directory │ └── package.json ├── counter │ ├── index.js │ └── package.json └── package.json ⇦ the only mandatory file ​ Copy Once you create the custom modules directory and the package.json you can apply it to your CPM for Docker and Kubernetes. Docker For Docker, launch CPM mounting the directory at /var/lib/newrelic/synthetics/modules. For example: docker run ... -v /example-custom-modules-dir:/var/lib/newrelic/synthetics/modules:rw ... Copy Kubernetes Complete the following: Launch the CPM, setting a value for the persistence.customModules configuration value either in the command line or in a YAML file during installation. The value should specify the subpath on your Minion's Persistent Volume where your custom modules files exist. For example: helm install ... --set persistence.customModules=<custom-modules-subpath> ... Copy Make sure that your custom modules directory is available on the Minion Pod. You can use kubectl cp as one method to copy the directory from your host to the Minion. For example: kubectl cp /example-custom-modules-dir <namespace>/<pod_name>:/var/lib/newrelic/synthetics/modules Copy Look at the CPM logs for \"... Initialization of Custom Modules ...\" to see if the modules were installed properly, or if there were any errors. The npm installation logs will be shown. Now you can add \"require('async');\" into the script of monitors you send to this private location. Change package.json for custom modules Along with npm modules, you can also use Node.js modules. To change the custom modules used by your CPM, modify package.json and reboot the CPM. It will detect the change in configuration during the reboot, and then clean up and re-install. Caution Local modules: While your package.json can include any local module, these modules must reside inside the tree under your custom module directory. If stored outside the tree, the initialization process will fail and you will see an error message in the docker logs after launching CPM. Permanent data storage CPM is a stateless application and does not preserve information from prior requests or sessions by default. However, you can preserve data between launches by enabling permanent data storage. For example, you can permanently set how the minion identifies itself (for example, Minion_ID), and use it to associate the data visible in Synthetics and Insights events with the exact minion that produced it. To set permanent data storage on Docker: Create a directory. Launch the CPM, mounting the directory at /var/lib/newrelic/synthetics. Example: docker run ... -v /example-permanent-dir:/var/lib/newrelic/synthetics:rw ... Copy To set permanent data storage on Kubernetes: Launch the CPM, setting a value for the persistence.permanentData configuration value either in the command line or in a YAML file during installation. The value should specify the subpath on your Minion's Persistent Volume where you want the data to be saved. Example: helm install ... --set persistence.permanentData=<permanent-data-subpath> ... Copy User-defined environment variables for scripted monitors Containerized private minions let you configure environment variables for use in scripted monitors. These variables are hosted locally on the CPM and can be accessed via $env.USER_DEFINED_VARIABLES. There are two ways to set user-defined variables: by mounting a JSON file or by supplying an environment variable to the CPM on launch. If both are provided, the CPM will use values provided from the environment only. Mounting JSON file The JSON file must have read permissions and contain a JSON formatted map. Example user-defined variable file: { \"KEY\" : \"VALUE\", \"User_Name\": \"MINION\", \"My_Password\": \"PASSW0RD 1 2 3\", \"my_URL\": \"https://newrelic.com/\", \"ETC\" : \"ETC\" } Copy The file must be available or mounted to the path in your container: /var/lib/newrelic/synthetics/variables/user_defined_variables.json Docker example: docker run ... -v /example-user-defined-variables.json:/var/lib/newrelic/synthetics/variables/user_defined_variables.json:rw ... Copy Kubernetes example: When mounting a JSON file to your Minion Pod in Kubernetes, you can either copy the file directly to the Minion Pod or to a Pod that has access to the same Persistent Volume and Persistent Volume Claim that the Minion will use. After successfully loading the file, you may need to restart your Minion Pod for the change to take effect. kubectl cp path/to/user_defined_variables.json <namespace>/<pod_name>:/var/lib/newrelic/synthetics/variables/user_defined_variables.json Copy Passing as an environment variable Use the -e flag to set up an environment variable named MINION_USER_DEFINED_VARIABLES and give it a value of a JSON formatted map string. docker run ... -e MINION_USER_DEFINED_ENV_VARIABLES='{\"KEY\":\"VALUE\",\"NAME\":\"MINION\",\"ETC\":\"ETC\"}' ... Copy Tip The CPM on Kubernetes does not currently support loading user-defined environment variables via environment variable. You will have to configure your Kubernetes CPM by mounting a JSON file. Accessing user-defined environment variables from scripts To reference a configured user-defined environment variable, use the reserved $env.USER_DEFINED_VARIABLES followed by the name of a given variable with dot notation. For example, $env.USER_DEFINED_VARIABLES.MY_VARIABLE Caution User-defined environment variables are not sanitized from logs. For sensitive information, consider using the secure credentials feature. Environment variables Environmental variables allow you to fine-tune the CPM configuration to meet your specific environmental and functional needs.

      "body": "You can use New Relic's containerized private minions (CPM). These are Docker container-based private minions that accept and execute synthetic monitors against your private locations. The CPM can operate in a Docker container system environment or a Kubernetes container orchestration system environment. The CPM will auto-detect its environment to select the appropriate operating mode. General private minion features Because the CPM operates as a container instead of a virtual machine, it delivers many features: Easy to install, start, and update Runs on: Linux macOS Windows Enhanced security and support for non-root user execution Ability to leverage a Docker container as a sandbox environment Customizable monitor check timeout Custom provided modules for scripted monitor types Kubernetes-specific features Also, the CPM delivers the following features in a Kubernetes environment: Integrates with the Kubernetes API to delegate runtime lifecycle management to Kubernetes Does not require privileged access to the Docker socket Supports hosted and on-premise Kubernetes clusters Supports various container engines such as Docker and Containerd Deployable via Helm charts as well as configuration YAMLs Allows job (ping vs. non-ping checks) based resource allocation for optimum resource management Observability offered via the New Relic One Kubernetes cluster explorer System requirements and compatibility To host CPMs, your system must meet the minimum requirements for the chosen system environment. Caution Do not modify any CPM files. New Relic is not liable for any modifications you make. For more information, contact your account representative or a New Relic technical sales rep. Docker container system environment requirements Compatibility for Requirements Operating system Linux kernel: 3.10 or higher. macOS: 10.11 or higher. Windows: Windows 10 64-bit or higher. You must also configure Docker to run Linux containers in order for CPMs to work on Windows systems. Processor A modern, multi-core CPU Memory 2.5 GiB of RAM per CPU core (dedicated) Disk space A minimum of 10 GB per host Docker version Docker 17.12.1-ce or higher Private location key You must have a private location key Caution The Docker CPM is not designed for use with container orchestrators like AWS ECS, Docker Swarm, Apache Mesos, Azure Container Instances, etc. Running the Docker CPM in a container orchestrator will result in unexpected issues because it is itself a container orchestrator. If you're using container orchestration, see our Kubernetes CPM requirements. Kubernetes container orchestration system environment requirements (CPM v3.0.0 or higher) Compatibility for Requirements Operating system Linux kernel: 3.10 or higher macOS: 10.11 or higher Windows: Windows 10 64-bit or higher Processor A modern, multi-core CPU Minion pod CPU (vCPU/Core): 0.5 up to 0.75 Memory: 800 Mi up to 1.6 Gi Resources allocated to a Minion pod are user configurable. Runner pod CPU (vCPU/Core): 0.5 up to 1 Memory: 1.25 Gi up to 3 Gi For a scripted API check, 1.25 Gi will be requested with a limit of 2.5 Gi. For a simple browser or scripted browser check, 2 Gi will be requested with a limit of 3 Gi. Additional considerations: Resources allocated to a runner pod are not user configurable. The maximum limit-request resource ratio for both CPU and memory is 2. Disk space Persistent volume (PV) of at least 10 Gi in size Note that if a ReadWriteOnce (RWO) PV is provided to the minion, an implicit node affinity will be established to ensure the minion and the runner containers are scheduled on the same node. This is required to allow the minion and the associated runners access to the PV, as an RWO PV can be accessed only by a single node in the cluster. Kubernetes version We recommend that your Kubernetes cluster supports Kubernetes v1.15. Caution We have identified a compatibility issue with Kubernetes v1.21+. A workaround is available by disabling the BoundServiceAccountTokenVolume feature gate on the cluster. Private location key You must have a private location key Helm Follow installation instructions for Helm v3 for your OS. Kubectl Follow installation instructions for Kubectl for your OS. To view versions, dependencies, default values for how many runner pods start with each minion, the Persistent volume access mode, and more, please see Show help and examples below. Private location key Before launching CPMs, you must have a private location key. Your CPM uses the key to authenticate against New Relic and run monitors associated with that private location. To find the key for existing private location: Go to one.newrelic.com > Synthetics > Private locations. In the Private locations index, locate the private location you want your CPM to be assigned to. Note the key associated with the private location with the key icon. Sandboxing and Docker dependencies Sandboxing and Docker dependencies are applicable to the CPM in a Docker container system environment. Docker dependencies The CPM runs in Docker and is able to leverage Docker as a sandboxing technology. This ensures complete isolation of the monitor execution, which improves security, reliability, and repeatability. Every time a scripted or browser monitor is executed, the CPM creates a brand new Docker container to run it in called a runner. The minion container needs to be configured to communicate with the Docker engine in order to spawn additional runner containers. Each spawned container is then dedicated to run a check associated with the synthetic monitor running on the private location the minion container is associated with. There are two crucial dependencies at launch. To enable sandboxing, ensure that: Your writable and executable directory is mounted at /tmp. The writable directory can be any directory you want the CPM to write into, but New Relic recommends the system's own /tmp to make things easy. Your writable Docker UNIX socket is mounted at /var/run/docker.sock or DOCKER_HOST environment variable. For more information, see Docker's Daemon socket option. Caution Core count on the host determines how many runner containers the CPM can run concurrently on the host. Since memory requirements are scaled to the expected count of runner containers, we recommend not running multiple CPMs on the same host to avoid resource contention. For additional information on sandboxing and running as a root or non-root user, see Security, sandboxing, and running as non-root. Install and update CPM versions Both installing and updating the CPM use the same command to pull the latest Docker image from the Quay.io repository where the CPM Docker image is hosted. Go to quay.io/repository/newrelic/synthetics-minion for a list of all the releases. CPM images are also hosted on Docker Hub. Go to hub.docker.com/r/newrelic/synthetics-minion/tags for a list of all the releases. Unless hosting the images in a local image repository, connections to either quay.io or docker.io will need to be allowed through your firewall in order for Docker to pull the synthetics-minion and synthetics-minion-runner images. The \"runner\" image is pulled automatically on startup of the synthetics-minion container. See Docker environment configuration and Kubernetes environment configuration for details on how to set a local repository and the runner registry endpoint. Start the CPM To start the CPM, follow the applicable Docker or Kubernetes instructions. Docker start procedure Locate your private location key. Ensure you've enabled Docker dependencies for sandboxing and installed CPM on your system. Run the appropriate script for your system. Tailor the common defaults for /tmp and /var/run/docker.sock in the following examples to match your system. Linux/macOS: docker run \\ --name YOUR_CONTAINER_NAME \\ -e \"MINION_PRIVATE_LOCATION_KEY=YOUR_PRIVATE_LOCATION_KEY\" \\ -v /tmp:/tmp:rw \\ -v /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock:rw \\ -d \\ --restart unless-stopped \\ quay.io/newrelic/synthetics-minion:latest Copy Windows: docker run ^ --name YOUR_CONTAINER_NAME ^ -e \"MINION_PRIVATE_LOCATION_KEY=YOUR_PRIVATE_LOCATION_KEY\" ^ -v /tmp:/tmp:rw ^ -v /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock:rw ^ -d ^ --restart unless-stopped ^ quay.io/newrelic/synthetics-minion:latest Copy View the logs for your minion container: docker logs --follow YOUR_CONTAINER_NAME Copy When a message similar to Synthetics Minion is ready and servicing location YOUR_PRIVATE_LOCATION_LABEL appears, your CPM is up and ready to run monitors assigned to that location. Kubernetes start procedure Locate your private location key. Set up the a namespace for the CPM in your Kubernetes cluster: kubectl create namespace YOUR_NAMESPACE Copy Copy the Helm charts from the New Relic Helm repo. If you are copying the charts for the first time: helm repo add YOUR_REPO_NAME https://helm-charts.newrelic.com Copy If you previously copied the Helm charts from the New Relic Helm repo, then get the latest: helm repo update Copy Install the CPM with the following Helm command: For a fresh installation of the CPM: helm install YOUR_CPM_NAME YOUR_REPO_NAME/synthetics-minion -n YOUR_NAMESPACE --set synthetics.privateLocationKey=YOUR_PRIVATE_LOCATION_KEY Copy To update an existing CPM installation: helm upgrade YOUR_CPM_NAME YOUR_REPO_NAME/synthetics-minion -n YOUR_NAMESPACE --set synthetics.privateLocationKey=YOUR_PRIVATE_LOCATION_KEY Copy Check if the minion pod is up and running: kubectl get -n YOUR_NAMESPACE pods Copy Once the status attribute of each pod is shown as running, your CPM is up and ready to run monitors assigned to your private location. Stop or delete the CPM On a Docker container system environment, use the Docker stop procedure to stop the CPM from running. On a Kubernetes container orchestration system environment, use the Kubernetes delete procedure to stop the CPM from running. Docker stop procedure You can stop a Docker container either by the container name, or the container ID. Container name stop for Linux, macOS, and Windows: docker stop YOUR_CONTAINER_NAME docker rm YOUR_CONTAINER_NAME Copy Container ID stop for Linux/macOS: In the examples the container is stopped and removed. To only stop the container, omit docker rm $CONTAINER_ID. CONTAINER_ID=$(docker ps -aqf name=YOUR_CONTAINER_NAME) docker stop $CONTAINER_ID docker rm $CONTAINER_ID Copy Container ID stop for Windows: In the examples the container is stopped and removed. To only stop the container, omit docker rm $CONTAINER_ID. FOR /F \"tokens=*\" %%CID IN ('docker ps -aqf name=YOUR_CONTAINER_NAME') do (SET CONTAINER_ID=%%CID) docker stop %CONTAINER_ID% docker rm %CONTAINER_ID% Copy Kubernetes delete procedure Get the MINION_POD_INSTALLATION_NAME of the minion pod you want to delete: helm list -n YOUR_NAMESPACE Copy Delete the minion pod: helm uninstall -n YOUR_NAMESPACE MINION_POD_INSTALLATION_NAME Copy Delete the namespace set up for the CPM in your Kubernetes cluster: kubectl delete namespace YOUR_NAMESPACE Copy Show help and examples Use these options as applicable: To get a list of the most commonly used run options directly in the command line interface, run the show help command. To show CPM usage examples as well as the list of all the available run options, run this command: docker run quay.io/newrelic/synthetics-minion:latest help Copy To keep track of Docker logs and verify the health of your monitors, see Containerized private minion (CPM) maintenance and monitoring. For a CPM in the Kubernetes container orchestration system environment, the following Helm show commands can be used to view the chart.yaml and the values.yaml, respectively: helm show chart YOUR_REPO_NAME/synthetics-minion Copy helm show values YOUR_REPO_NAME/synthetics-minion Copy Show license information To show the licensing information for the open source software that we use in the CPM, run the LICENSE command. Run this command to view license information for CPM versions 2.2.27 or higher: docker run quay.io/newrelic/synthetics-minion:latest LICENSE Copy Some of our open-source software is listed under multiple software licenses, and in that case we have listed the license we've chosen to use. Our license information is also available in the our licenses documentation. Configure CPM You can configure the containerized private minion with custom npm modules, preserve data between launches, use environment variables, and more. For more information, see CPM configuration. Networks For both Docker and Kubernetes, the CPM and its runner containers will inherit network settings from the host. For an example of this on a Docker container system environment, see the Docker site. A new bridge network is created for each runner container. This means networking command options like --network and --dns passed to the CPM container at launch (such as through Docker run commands on a Docker container system environment) are not inherited or used by the runner containers. When these networks are created, they pull from the default IP address pool configured for daemon. For an example of this on a Docker container system environment, see the Docker site. Typically, the runner network is removed after the check is completed. However, if a CPM exits while a check is still running, or exits in another unexpected circumstance, these networks may get orphaned. This can potentially use up IP address space that is available to the Docker daemon. If this happens, you may see INTERNAL ENGINE ERROR code: 31 entries in your CPM logging when trying to create a new runner container. To clean these up in Docker container system environments only, run docker network prune. Security, sandboxing, and running as non-root By default, the software running inside a CPM is executed with root user privileges. This is suitable for most scenarios, as the execution is sandboxed. In a Docker container system environment: To change the default AppArmor profile used by containers that CPM spawns to run monitors, see the environment variable MINION_RUNNER_APPARMOR (CPM version 3.0.3 or higher) or MINION_DOCKER_RUNNER_APPARMOR (CPM version up to v3.0.2). To run the CPM as a non-root user, additional steps are required: Run as non-root user for Docker For more information, see Docker's official documentation about security and AppArmor security profiles. If your environment requires you to run the CPM as a non-root user, follow this procedure. In the following example, the non-root user is my_user. Ensure that my_user can use the Docker engine on the host: Verify that my_user belongs to the \"docker\" system group. OR Enable the Docker TCP socket option, and pass the DOCKER_HOST environment variable to CPM. Verify that my_user has read/write permissions to all the directories and volumes passed to CPM. To set these permission, use the chmod command. Get the uid of my_user for use in the run command: id -u my_user. Once these conditions are met, use the option \"-u <uid>:<gid>\" when launching CPM: docker run ... -u 1002 ... Copy OR docker run ... -u 1002 -e DOCKER_HOST=http://localhost:2375 ... Copy Docker image repository A single CPM Docker image serves both the Docker container system environment and Kubernetes container orchestration system environment. The Docker image is hosted on quay.io. To make sure your Docker image is up-to-date, see the quay.io newrelic/synthetics-minion repository. Additional considerations for CPM connection Connection Description CPMs without Internet access A CPM can operate without access to the internet, but with some exceptions. The public internet health check can be disabled using the environment variables named MINION_NETWORK_HEALTHCHECK_DISABLED for a Docker container system environment or synthetics.minionNetworkHealthCheckDisabled for a Kubernetes container orchestration system environment. The CPM needs to be able to contact the \"synthetics-horde.nr-data.net\" domain. This is necessary for it to report data to New Relic and to receive monitors to execute. Ask your network administration if this is a problem and how to set up exceptions. Communicate with Synthetics via a proxy To set up communication with New Relic by proxy, use the environment variables named MINION_API_PROXY*. Arguments passed at launch This applies to a Docker container environment only. Arguments passed to the CPM container at launch do not get passed on to the containers spawned by the CPM. Docker has no concept of \"inheritance\" or a \"hierarchy\" of containers, and we don't copy the configuration that is passed from CPM to the monitor-running containers. The only shared configuration between them is the one set at the Docker daemon level.",

      "body": "Read on to learn how to configure your containerized private minion (CPM). You can do the following to customize your CPMs: Set up custom modules for scripted browsers in New Relic. Preserve launch data with permanent data storage. Use environment variables in your configuration. You may not modify any CPM files and New Relic is not liable for any modifications you make. Guidelines for mounting volumes All directories and files must be assigned group ownership as 3729 with read/write permissions. This ensures that the Runner, which uses uid: 1000 and gid: 3729, has access to all the mounted volumes. However, the Minion is able to run as root (uid: 0) or with any uid between the range of [2000, 4000], inclusive. For more information, see running as non-root in Kubernetes or Docker. Docker Directories are mounted onto a container as volumes by specifying a -v argument within docker run For example, docker run ... -v /path/to/src:/path/to/dest:rw Kubernetes It is possible to add a directory onto a persistent volume (PV) by using kubectl cp. However, alternative approaches are supported as long as the file permissions are set appropriately. For example, kubectl cp /path/to/src <POD_NAME>:/path/to/dest will add a directory onto each PV in the specified pod Each PV must have a separate copy of the directories. For example, a cluster with n Minion replicas must have n PVs, each with their own copy of directories The directories and files must be added prior to the Minion boot up, otherwise the Minion must be restarted to detect the updates Custom npm modules Custom npm modules are exclusive to the CPM. They allow you to provide an arbitrary set of npm modules, and make them available for scripted monitors in Synthetics. To set up the modules: Create a directory which contains a package.json, following the npm official guidelines, in the root of the directory. Anything contained in the dependencies field will be installed by the CPM at start, and made available when running monitors on that private minion. Optionally, you can override the root level package.json with a Node version-specific directory. This allows a script to be updated per monitor runtime if a Node version of a runtime is no longer compatible with your dependencies. See an example of this below. Custom module directory In this example, a custom module directory is used with the following structure: /example-custom-modules-dir/ ├── counter │ ├── index.js │ └── package.json └── package.json ⇦ the only mandatory file Copy The package.json defines dependencies as both a local module (for example, counter) and an npm hosted modules (for example, async version ^2.6.1): { \"name\": \"custom-modules\", \"version\": \"1.0.0\", ⇦ optional \"description\": \"example custom modules directory\", ⇦ optional \"dependencies\": { \"async\": \"^2.6.1\", ⇦ npm hosted module \"counter\": \"file:./counter\" ⇦ Local module } } Copy Node version-specific overrides You can declare a package.json per Node version that will override the root level package.json. This allows a monitor script to be updated per monitor runtime in the event that the Node version of a runtime is no longer compatible with your dependencies. As shown in the first example, local modules can still be defined within a version specific directory. If a package.json is not defined for a specific Node version, then the root level package.json will be used to install dependencies. In this example, a custom module directory is used with the following structure: /example-custom-modules-dir/ ├── 6.11.2 ⇦ optional Node specific directory │ └── package.json └── 10.15.0 ⇦ optional Node specific directory │ └── package.json ├── counter │ ├── index.js │ └── package.json └── package.json ⇦ the only mandatory file ​ Copy Once you create the custom modules directory and the package.json you can apply it to your CPM for Docker and Kubernetes. Docker For Docker, launch CPM mounting the directory at /var/lib/newrelic/synthetics/modules. For example: docker run ... -v /example-custom-modules-dir:/var/lib/newrelic/synthetics/modules:rw ... Copy Kubernetes Complete the following: Launch the CPM, setting a value for the persistence.customModules configuration value either in the command line or in a YAML file during installation. The value should specify the subpath on your Minion's Persistent Volume where your custom modules files exist. For example: helm install ... --set persistence.customModules=<custom-modules-subpath> ... Copy Make sure that your custom modules directory is available on the Minion Pod. You can use kubectl cp as one method to copy the directory from your host to the Minion. For example: kubectl cp /example-custom-modules-dir <namespace>/<pod_name>:/var/lib/newrelic/synthetics/modules Copy Look at the CPM logs for \"... Initialization of Custom Modules ...\" to see if the modules were installed properly, or if there were any errors. The npm installation logs will be shown. Now you can add \"require('async');\" into the script of monitors you send to this private location. Change package.json for custom modules Along with npm modules, you can also use Node.js modules. To change the custom modules used by your CPM, modify package.json and reboot the CPM. It will detect the change in configuration during the reboot, and then clean up and re-install. Caution Local modules: While your package.json can include any local module, these modules must reside inside the tree under your custom module directory. If stored outside the tree, the initialization process will fail and you will see an error message in the docker logs after launching CPM. Permanent data storage CPM is a stateless application and does not preserve information from prior requests or sessions by default. However, you can preserve data between launches by enabling permanent data storage. For example, you can permanently set how the minion identifies itself (for example, Minion_ID), and use it to associate the data visible in Synthetics and Insights events with the exact minion that produced it. To set permanent data storage on Docker: Create a directory. Launch the CPM, mounting the directory at /var/lib/newrelic/synthetics. Example: docker run ... -v /example-permanent-dir:/var/lib/newrelic/synthetics:rw ... Copy To set permanent data storage on Kubernetes: Launch the CPM, setting a value for the persistence.permanentData configuration value either in the command line or in a YAML file during installation. The value should specify the subpath on your Minion's Persistent Volume where you want the data to be saved. Example: helm install ... --set persistence.permanentData=<permanent-data-subpath> ... Copy User-defined environment variables for scripted monitors Containerized private minions let you configure environment variables for use in scripted monitors. These variables are hosted locally on the CPM and can be accessed via $env.USER_DEFINED_VARIABLES. There are two ways to set user-defined variables: by mounting a JSON file or by supplying an environment variable to the CPM on launch. If both are provided, the CPM will use values provided from the environment only. Mounting JSON file The JSON file must have read permissions and contain a JSON formatted map. Example user-defined variable file: { \"KEY\" : \"VALUE\", \"User_Name\": \"MINION\", \"My_Password\": \"PASSW0RD 1 2 3\", \"my_URL\": \"https://newrelic.com/\", \"ETC\" : \"ETC\" } Copy The file must be available or mounted to the path in your container: /var/lib/newrelic/synthetics/variables/user_defined_variables.json Docker example: docker run ... -v /example-user-defined-variables.json:/var/lib/newrelic/synthetics/variables/user_defined_variables.json:rw ... Copy Kubernetes example: When mounting a JSON file to your Minion Pod in Kubernetes, you can either copy the file directly to the Minion Pod or to a Pod that has access to the same Persistent Volume and Persistent Volume Claim that the Minion will use. After successfully loading the file, you may need to restart your Minion Pod for the change to take effect. kubectl cp path/to/user_defined_variables.json <namespace>/<pod_name>:/var/lib/newrelic/synthetics/variables/user_defined_variables.json Copy Passing as an environment variable Use the -e flag to set up an environment variable named MINION_USER_DEFINED_VARIABLES and give it a value of a JSON formatted map string. docker run ... -e MINION_USER_DEFINED_ENV_VARIABLES='{\"KEY\":\"VALUE\",\"NAME\":\"MINION\",\"ETC\":\"ETC\"}' ... Copy Tip The CPM on Kubernetes does not currently support loading user-defined environment variables via environment variable. You will have to configure your Kubernetes CPM by mounting a JSON file. Accessing user-defined environment variables from scripts To reference a configured user-defined environment variable, use the reserved $env.USER_DEFINED_VARIABLES followed by the name of a given variable with dot notation. For example, $env.USER_DEFINED_VARIABLES.MY_VARIABLE Caution User-defined environment variables are not sanitized from logs. For sensitive information, consider using the secure credentials feature. Environment variables Environmental variables allow you to fine-tune the CPM configuration to meet your specific environmental and functional needs. Docker environment configuration The variables are provided at startup using the -e, --env argument. The following table shows all the environment variables that CPM supports.

      "body": "Read on to learn about synthetic monitoring's proxy settings and properties. Proxy settings API for scripted monitors Important You can set proxy server configuration for synthetic scripted monitors for monitor versions 0.4.0 or higher. The global object $network allows you to control the network configuration used by your synthetic scripted monitors. The following are applicable for both scripted browsers and API tests, unless otherwise stated. $network.setProxy(string or object PROXY URL) Sets a proxy server to be used for all per-URL requests (HTTP, HTTPS, and FTP). Additional notes: The port is optional. If not provided, it will be derived from the scheme. For example, for HTTP the port would be 80. The username and password are assumed to be the result of a call to encodeURIComponent(). Special characters like @ and : in the username and/or the password must be escaped. Returns This method returns a Promise that will resolve once the configuration has been applied. Parameters Parameter Data Type Description proxyURL | proxyUrlParsed String or Object The URL to connect to the proxy server. A string containing a proxyURL (for example, http://proxy_host:8888) or a plain object in the same format as defined by Node's url.parse(urlString) method. Examples An example of setting a proxy server with HTTP protocol on port 1234 with no authentication: $network.setProxy('http://host.com:1234') Copy An example of setting a proxy server with HTTP protocol with authentication credentials. $network.setProxy('http://proxyUsername:proxyPassword@proxyHost:1234') Copy $network.setProxyForHttp(string or object PROXY URL) Tip This call is exactly the same as the per-URL setProxy call, except that it applies to HTTP traffic. Sets a proxy server to be used for all HTTP requests. Additional notes: The port is optional. If not provided, it will be derived from the scheme. For example, for HTTP the port would be 80. The username and password are assumed to be the result of a call to encodeURIComponent(). Special characters like @ and : in the username and/or the password must be escaped. Returns This method returns a Promise that will resolve once the configuration has been applied. Parameters Parameter Data Type Description proxyURL | proxyUrlParsed String or Object The URL to connect to the proxy server. A string containing a proxyURL (for example, http://proxy_host:8888) or a plain object in the same format as defined by Node's url.parse(urlString) method. Examples An example of setting a proxy server with HTTP protocol on port 1234 with no authentication: $network.setProxyForHttp('http://host.com:1234') Copy An example of setting a proxy server with HTTP protocol with authentication credentials. $network.setProxyForHttp('http://proxyUsername:proxyPassword@proxyHost:1234') Copy $network.setProxyForHttps(string or object PROXY URL) Tip This call is exactly the same as the per-URL setProxy call, except that it applies to HTTPS traffic. Sets a proxy server to be used for all HTTPS requests. Additional notes: The port is optional. If not provided, it will be derived from the scheme. For example, for HTTP the default port would be 443. The username and password are assumed to be the result of a call to encodeURIComponent(). Special characters like @ and : in the username and/or the password must be escaped. Returns This method returns a Promise that will resolve once the configuration has been applied. Parameters Parameter Data Type Description proxyURL | proxyUrlParsed String or Object The URL to connect to the proxy server. A string containing a proxyURL (for example, http://proxy_host:8888) or a plain object in the same format as defined by Node's url.parse(urlString) method. Examples An example of setting a proxy server with HTTPS protocol on port 1234 with no authentication: $network.setProxyForHttps('https://host.com:1234') Copy An example of setting a proxy server with HTTPS protocol with authentication credentials. $network.setProxyForHttps('https://proxyUsername:proxyPassword@proxyHost:1234') Copy $network.setProxyPAC(string PAC SCRIPT URL, object AUTH OBJECT) Sets a proxy server via a proxy auto-config (PAC) script and returns a promise. This function is only available for scripted browser monitors. Returns This method returns a Promise that will resolve once the configuration has been applied. Parameters Parameter Data Type Description scriptURL String The URL of the PAC script. authCredentialsMap Object Map of authentication credentials to be provided to the proxy server(s), keyed by the hostnames of the proxy server. Values of this map must be defined in the format {username: 'authUsername', password: 'authPassword'} Examples An example of setting a proxy server via a proxy auto-config (PAC) script: var authCredentialsMap = { 'example.com': {username: 'authUsername', password: 'authPassword'}, } Copy Here's an example of setting up a proxied network via proxy auto-config (PAC) script: var authCredentialsMap = { 'example.com': {username: 'authUsername', password: 'authPassword'}, 'anotherExample.com': {username: 'authUsername', password: 'authPassword'}, } $network.setProxyPAC(\"https://www.example.com/pacScript\", authCredentialsMap) Copy $network.setProxyAdvanced(object PROXY RULES OBJECT) Tip This method is Chrome-specific: it only applies to scripted browser monitor types. It can be used to allow for a more flexible and complex proxy configuration. In most cases, this method will not be needed. Sets the proxy configuration using the format supported by Chrome Extension API for Proxying. The input is a ProxyRules object, as defined by the Chrome Extension API to configures proxies. You can add authCredentials for proxies that need it. See Parameters for more details. Returns This method returns a Promise that will resolve once the configuration has been applied. Parameters Parameter Data Type Description ProxyRules Object Object The proxyRulesObject is a plain object that follows the format ProxyRules as defined by the Chrome Extension API to configures proxies. This object is \"flavoured\" to fit our runtime: users can define an additional property, authCredentials, for the Proxy server objects to provide authentication credentials for a specific proxy server. authCredentials is an object in the format {username: 'authUsername', password: 'authPassword'}. Examples Here's an example of creating a proxyRules with authCredentials: var proxyRules = { singleProxy: { host:\"example.com\", authCredentials: { username: 'authUsername', password: 'authPassword' } } }; Copy Here's an example of setting up a proxied network with mixed network zone assets: var proxyRules = {singleProxy: {host:\"http://entproxy.mycompany.com\"}, bypassList:['s3.amazonaws.com','*.localcdn.com'] } $network.setProxyAdvanced(proxyRules) Copy $network.clearProxy() Clears/removes the current proxy configuration. Returns This method returns a Promise that will resolve once the configuration has been applied. $network.getProxy() This method returns the current proxy configuration. It must be synchronized in a promise callback. Examples An example of synchronizing getProxy with $network.setProxy(); and $network.clearProxy();: var assert = require('assert'); $network.setProxy(\"http://user:password@myproxyurl.com\") .then(function () { console.log('Proxy configuration applied'); //Note: $network.getProxy() is not synchronized with the webdriver Control Flow. //To make sure we get the proxy configuration after the call to setProxy() above // succeeds we need to use a promise callback var proxyData = $network.getProxy(); console.log(proxyData); }) .then(function () { // Again: getProxy() is not synchronized with the Webdriver Control Flow: we //need this promise callback otherwise clearProxy() might be called before the call // to getProxy() above returns return $network.clearProxy(); }) .then(function () { console.log('Proxy configuration cleared'); // We need this promise callback for reasons explained above var proxyData = $network.getProxy(); assert.equal(proxyData.rules, null); }); Copy Proxy properties Important This proxy information applies only to these versions: API monitors: 0.4.0, 0.2.2, 0.2.1, 0.1.0 Scripted monitors: 0.1.0 In order to analyze and collect your HTTP traffic metrics, New Relic must ensure the traffic passes through a conceptual funnel. Our synthetic monitoring includes a software funnel component capable of analyzing the HTTP requests or responses and then recording the information. New Relic's scripted browser monitors (versions 0.4.x and lower) include a mechanism to do this analysis without needing an HTTP proxy, so you don't have to configure anything. New Relic's API test (versions 0.4.x and lower) provides an $http object that is pre-configured to make the requests pass through the internal HTTP proxy. This allows you to write your test without including any proxy settings. If you want to use some other way to generate HTTP traffic while still collecting the HTTP traffic metrics, you can use $env.PROXY_HOST and $env.PROXY_PORT. To record traffic metrics, be sure to include these properties in your script.",

      "body": "Use synthetic monitoring's API tests to monitor your API endpoint to ensure it is functioning correctly. New Relic uses the http-request module internally to make HTTP calls to your endpoint and validate the results. Here we present some example functions showing how to use the $http object to submit your request. For detailed documentation on the options available for this object, see the http-request readme. (Note that Request is deprecated, but these options still apply.) Tip To view and share other API test examples, visit the synthetics scripts section in Explorers Hub. Use API http-request module API tests are powered by the http-request module, which is available through the $http object. Once each frequency interval, New Relic queries your endpoint from each of your selected locations. For instructions on creating a monitor, see Adding monitors. Read on to learn how to define metadata for your request, make a GET request, make a POST request, and how to validate the results. Important After a maximum run time of three minutes, New Relic manually stops the script. one.newrelic.com > Synthetics > Create monitor: The script editor suggests functions, selectors, and other elements to simplify scripting commands (available in GitHub). Configure request options To start your script: Declare a variable (such as options) to store your request options object. Define request options such as the URL endpoint, and custom headers. If you're setting SSL or agent options, see SSL and agentOptions requirements. We recommend using SSL to avoid exposing plain text credentials in your headers. Tip For a full list of supported request options, see request(options, callback) in the http-request documentation on GitHub. Here's an example of optional metadata in the options object: Using optional metadata //Declare optional metadata var options = { //Specify the endpoint URL url: 'https://api-endpoint.example.com', //Specify optional headers headers: { 'Endpoint-Key': 'uqNTC57Phe72pnnB8JuJmwAr7b09nKSKSz', 'Additional-Header': 'Additional-Header-Data' } }; Copy For SSL and agentOptions: If you are setting SSL options or providing an agentOptions object, the agent property in the request options object will need to be set to $globalAgents.https or $globalAgents.http to ensure your HTTP requests use the instrumented global agent. Here's an example of using a SSL option or agentOptions: Using a SSL option or agentOptions This example uses agentOptions: //Declare optional metadata var options = { //Specify the endpoint URL url: 'https://api-endpoint.example.com', //Specify optional headers headers: { 'Endpoint-Key': 'uqNTC57Phe72pnnB8JuJmwAr7b09nKSKSz', 'Additional-Header': 'Additional-Header-Data' } //Specify global agent as the http agent agent: $globalAgents.https, //Set SSL option strictSSL: true, //Specify http agent options agentOptions: { ​maxVersion: 'TLSv1.1' }, }; Copy Send a GET request To make a GET request, use the $http.get method to submit your request. Define your request options, make your request using $http.get, then validate the response to ensure your endpoint is returning the correct results. Insights GET example This example queries the Insights API by using GET: //Define your authentication credentials var myAccountID = '{YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID}'; var myQueryKey = '{YOUR_QUERY_KEY}'; var options = { //Define endpoint URI uri: 'https://insights-api.newrelic.com/v1/accounts/'+myAccountID+'/query?nrql=SELECT%20average(duration)%20FROM%20Transaction', //Define query key and expected data type. headers: { 'X-Query-Key': myQueryKey, 'Accept': 'application/json' } }; //Define expected results using callback function. function callback (err, response, body){ //Log JSON results from endpoint to Synthetics console. console.log(JSON.parse(body)); console.log('done with script'); } //Make GET request, passing in options and callback. $http.get(options,callback); Copy Send a POST request To make a POST request, use the $http.post method to submit your request. Define your request options, make your request using $http.post, then validate the response to ensure your endpoint is returning the correct results. Custom event POST example This example POSTs a custom event containing static integers to the Event API: //Define your authentication credentials. var myAccountID = '{YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID}'; var myLicenseKey = '{YOUR_LICENSE_KEY}'; //Import the 'assert' module to validate results. var assert = require('assert'); var options = { //Define endpoint URL. url: \"https://insights-collector.newrelic.com/v1/accounts/\"+myAccountID+\"/events\", //Define body of POST request. body: '[{\"eventType\":\"SyntheticsEvent\",\"integer1\":1000,\"integer2\":2000}]', //Define New Relic license key and expected data type. headers: { 'Api-Key': myLicenseKey, 'Content-Type': 'application/json' } }; //Define expected results using callback function. function callback(error, response, body) { //Log status code to Synthetics console. console.log(response.statusCode + \" status code\") //Verify endpoint returns 200 (OK) response code. assert.ok(response.statusCode == 200, 'Expected 200 OK response'); //Parse JSON received from Insights into variable. var info = JSON.parse(body); //Verify that `info` contains element named `success` with a value of `true`. assert.ok(info.success == true, 'Expected True results in Response Body, result was ' + info.success); //Log end of script. console.log(\"End reached\"); } //Make POST request, passing in options and callback. $http.post(options, callback); Copy Validate results To validate your results, import the assert module to define your test case. Call an assert method to validate your endpoint's response. If any assert functions fail, the entire monitor will be considered a failed check. This may trigger alert notifications and affect your metrics. Important Synthetic monitoring does not allow thrown exceptions. Thrown exceptions result in script failure. Use the assert module to validate your results, and use console.log() to log results to the synthetic's console. Event API validation example This example POSTs to the Event API, then validates that the response is {\"success\":true}: //Define your authentication credentials. var myAccountID = '{YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID}'; var myLicenseKey = '{YOUR_LICENSE_KEY}'; //Import the `assert` module to validate results. var assert = require('assert'); var options = { //Define endpoint URL. url: \"https://insights-collector.newrelic.com/v1/accounts/\"+myAccountID+\"/events\", //Define body of POST request. body: '[{\"eventType\":\"SyntheticsEvent\",\"integer1\":1000,\"integer2\":2000}]', //Define New Relic license key and expected data type. headers: { 'Api-Key': myLicenseKey, 'Content-Type': 'application/json' } }; $http.post(options, function(error, response, body) { //Log status code to Synthetics console. The status code is logged before the `assert` function, //because a failed assert function ends the script. console.log(response.statusCode + \" status code\") //Call `assert` method, expecting a `200` response code. //If assertion fails, log `Expected 200 OK response` as error message to Synthetics console. assert.ok(response.statusCode == 200, 'Expected 200 OK response'); var info = JSON.parse(body); //Call `assert` method, expecting body to return `{\"success\":true}`. //If assertion fails, log `Expected True results in Response Body,` plus results as error message to Synthetics console. assert.ok(info.success == true, 'Expected True results in Response Body, result was ' + info.success); }); Copy",

      "body": "This document is for synthetic monitor versions 0.4.x or lower. See also the documentation for Synthetic monitor versions 0.5 or higher. Overview Synthetic scripted browsers provide you access to the Selenium Webdriver APIs 2.47.0 via the variables $driver and $browser. In particular: $driver provides all the exports from the selenium-webdriver module (for example, ActionSequence, Button, By, WebElement, etc.). $browser is a synthetic-flavored instance of selenium-webdriver.WebDriver(): it exposes the main basic WebDriver APIs like get() and findElement(), as well as some synthetic custom APIs. This document describes the functions available for synthetic scripted browser monitors version 0.4.0 or lower. For the newest monitor documentation, see monitor version 0.5.0+ documentation. Other relevant documentation: For more on synthetic scripting, see Write scripted browsers. For example scripts, see Scripted browser examples. For more information about monitor versions and runtime differences, see Runtime environments. To view and share scripted browser examples, check out topics tagged synthetic-script in New Relic's Explorers Hub. Top-level functions: Build your script New Relic calls top-level functions directly from your $browser instance. These provide a wide range of functionality that covers many basic scriptable actions. Function Return value $browser.actions() Creates a new action sequence using this driver. For a list of available actions, see ActionSequence: Link multiple actions. void $browser.addHeader(headerKey: string, headerValue: string) Adds header headerKey with value headerValue to the runtime. void $browser.addHeaders(headers: ?) Adds a map of headers to the runtime. void $browser.deleteHeader(header: string) Deletes a specific header from the runtime. void $browser.deleteHeaders(header: [string]) Deletes all headers in argument from runtime. void $browser.addHostnameToBlacklist(hostname: string) Disallows a hostname. Allows use wildcards. void $browser.addHostnamesToBlacklist(hostnameArr: [string]) Disallows all hostnames in an array of arguments. Allows use wildcards. void $browser.addHostnameToWhitelist(hostname: string) Allows a hostname blocked by default in synthetic monitoring. void $browser.addHostnamesToWhitelist(hostnameArr: [string]) Allows all hostnames in argument. void $browser.deleteHostnameFromBlacklist(hostname: string) Removes a hostname from this browser instance's blacklist. void $browser.deleteHostnamesFromBlacklist(hostnameArr: [string]) Removes all hostnames in argument from the disallowed list. void $browser.deleteHostnameFromWhitelist(hostnameArr: [string]) Removes a hostname from this browser instance's allowed list. void $browser.deleteHostnamesFromWhitelist(hostnameArr: [string]) Removes all hostnames in argument from this browser instance's allowed list. void $browser.executeAsyncScript(script: ?, var_args: ?) Schedules a command to execute asynchronous JavaScript in the context of the currently selected frame or window. promise $browser.executeScript(script: ?, var_args: ?) Schedules a command to execute JavaScript in the context of the currently selected frame or window. promise $browser.findElement(locator: $driver.Locator) Schedule a command to find an element on the page. If not found, New Relic returns an error. WebElement $browser.findElements(locator: $driver.Locator) Schedule a command to search for multiple elements on the page. promise $browser.waitForAndFindElement(locator: $driver.Locator [, timeout: number) Schedule a command to wait for and find an element on the page, and another command to wait for it to be visible. If not found, New Relic returns an error. The timeout value is an optional one, and gets applied separately to both tasks of finding the element and waiting for its visibility. This means at worst case, this method can take up to twice the provided timeout value. The default timeout value is 1000 ms (1 second). promise $browser.get(url: string) Loads a webpage in a synthetic browser. promise $browser.getAllWindowHandles() Schedules a command to retrieve the current list of available window handles. promise $browser.getCapabilities() A promise that will resolve with the instance's capabilities. promise $browser.getCurrentUrl() Schedules a command to retrieve the URL of the current page. promise $browser.getHeaders() Returns a map of currently configured headers. map $browser.getPageSource() Schedules a command to retrieve the current page's source. The page source returned is a representation of the underlying DOM; do not expect it to be formatted or escaped in the same way as the response sent from the web server. promise $browser.getSession() A promise for this client's session. promise $browser.getTitle() Schedules a command to retrieve the current page's title. promise $browser.getWindowHandle() Schedules a command to retrieve the current window handle. promise $browser.isElementPresent(locatorOrElement: $driver.Locator) Schedules a command to test if an element is present on the page. If given a DOM element, this function will check if it belongs to the document the driver is currently focused on. Otherwise, the function will test if at least one element can be found with the given search criteria. promise $browser.manage() The options interface for this instance. You can manage cookies, timeouts, and other window options. void $browser.navigate() The navigation interface (history of browser functions) for this instance. void $browser.schedule(command: ?, description: string) Schedules a command to be executed by this driver's CommandExecutor. promise $browser.sleep() Schedules a command to make the driver sleep for the given amount of time. promise $browser.switchTo() The target locator interface for this instance. void $browser.takeScreenshot() Schedule a command to take a screenshot. promise $browser.wait(fn: $driver.until.Condition, timeout: number, opt_message: string) Schedules a command to wait for a condition to hold, as defined by some user supplied function. webElement $browser.waitForPendingRequests(timeout: number) Causes the script to wait for requests that have been initiated to return, up to the timeout. Useful for tracking non-blocking resources. promise Disallow list: Wildcard use Disallowing domains for your browser instance requires wildcards to match the URL syntax of the URL to be blocked. An overall .com disallowed list needs to contain these functions: Function Blocking action $browser.addHostnameToBlacklist('*.com'); a.com $browser.addHostnameToBlacklist('*.*.com'); a.b.com $browser.addHostnameToBlacklist('*.*.*.com'); a.b.c.com $browser.addHostnameToBlacklist('www.*.com'); www.a.com $browser.addHostnameToBlacklist('www.*.*.com'); www.a.b.com $browser.addHostnameToBlacklist('www.*.*.*.com'); www.a.b.c.com Options: Manage the browser instance These functions manage options for your browser instance such as cookies, timeouts and window size. Access these options through the $browser.manage() function. Function Return value $browser.manage().addCookie(name: string, value: string, opt_path: string, opt_domain: string, opt_isSecure: boolean, opt_expiry: number) Schedules a command to add a cookie. promise $browser.manage().deleteAllCookies() Schedules a command to delete all cookies visible to the current page. promise $browser.manage().deleteCookie(name: string) Schedules a command to delete the cookie with the given name. This command is a no-op if there is no cookie with the given name visible to the current page. promise $browser.manage().getCookie(name: string) Schedules a command to retrieve the cookie with the given name. Returns null if there is no such cookie. The cookie will be returned as a JSON object as described by the WebDriver wire protocol. promise $browser.manage().getCookies() Schedules a command to retrieve all cookies visible to the current page. New Relic Syntheticcs returns each cookie as a JSON object as described by the WebDriver wire protocol. promise $browser.manage().timeouts().implicitlyWait(ms: number) Specifies the amount of time the driver should wait when searching for an element if it is not immediately present. Setting the wait timeout to 0 disables implicit waiting. Be careful increasing the wait timeout, as it will increase test run time, especially with slower location strategies like XPath. Default is 10 seconds. promise $browser.manage().timeouts().pageLoadTimeout(ms: number) Sets the amount of time to wait for a page load to complete before returning an error. If the timeout is negative, page loads may last up to 180 seconds. Default is 60 seconds. promise $browser.manage().timeouts().setScriptTimeout(ms: number) Sets the amount of time to wait, in milliseconds, for an asynchronous script to finish execution before returning an error. Default is 30 seconds. promise $browser.manage().window().getPosition() Retrieves the window's current position, relative to the top left corner of the screen. promise $browser.manage().window().getSize() Retrieves the window's current size. promise $browser.manage().window().maximize() Maximizes the current window. promise $browser.manage().window().setPosition(x: number, y: number) Repositions the current window. promise $browser.manage().window().setSize(width: number, height: number) Resizes the current window. promise Locators: Find page elements Locators are a collection of factory functions for creating locator instances. Locators find DOM elements, which can be passed to functions such as $browser.findElement or $browser.isElementPresent. Call them through $driver.By. Function Return value $driver.By.className(className: string) Locates an element that has a specific class name. The returned locator is equivalent to searching for elements with the CSS selector .clazz. locator $driver.By.css(cssName: string) Locates an element using a CSS selector. locator $driver.By.id(id: string) Locates an element by its ID. locator $driver.By.linkText(linkText: string) Locates link elements whose visible text matches the given string. locator $driver.By.js(js: string) Locates an element by evaluating a JavaScript expression. locator $driver.By.name(name: string) Locates elements whose name attribute has the given value. locator $driver.By.partialLinkText(partialLinkText: string) Locates link elements whose getText visible contains the given substring. locator $driver.By.tagName(tagName: string) Locates elements with a given tag name. The returned locator is equivalent to using the getElementsByTagName DOM function. locator $driver.By.xpath(xpath: string) Locates elements matching a XPath selector. locator WebElement: Interact with page elements When a function such as $browser.findElement or $browser.waitForAndFindElement returns a WebElement reference, these functions can be used to interact with that element. Using these, you can click on buttons, sent text to form inputs, and get attributes of elements to test. Function Return value click() Clicks on this element. void sendKeys(var_args: ?) Schedules a command to type a sequence on the DOM element represented by this instance. WebElement getTagName() Schedules a command to query for the tag/node name of this element. WebElement getCssValue(name: string) Schedules a command to query for the computed style of the element represented by this instance. If the element inherits the named style from its parent, the parent will be queried for its value. Where possible, color values will be converted to their hex representation (for example, #00ff00 instead of rgb(0, 255, 0)). promise getAttribute(name: string) Schedules a command to query for the value of the given attribute of the element. promise getText(name: string) Get the visible (not hidden by CSS) innerText of this element, including sub-elements, without any leading or trailing white space. promise getSize() Schedules a command to compute the size of this element's bounding box, in pixels. promise getLocation() Schedules a command to compute the location of this element, in page space. promise isEnabled() Schedules a command to query whether the DOM element represented by this instance is enabled, as dictated by the disabled attribute. promise isSelected() Schedules a command to query whether this element is selected. promise submit() Schedules a command to submit the form containing this element (or this element if it is a FORM element). This command is a no-op if the element is not contained in a form. promise clear() Schedules a command to clear the value of this element. promise isDisplayed() Schedules a command to test whether this element is currently displayed. promise getOuterHtml() Schedules a command to retrieve the outer HTML of this element. promise getInnerHtml() Schedules a command to retrieve the inner HTML of this element. promise ActionSequence: Link multiple actions Action sequences can create complex user interactions with your website. To create a new action sequence, use $browser.actions(). To link multiple actions together into a sequence, include perform() after each. This executes and then terminates individual sequences, including single-action sequences. The following table contains a list of available actions. For more information, see the WebDriver ActionSequence documentation. Function Return value click(opt_elementOrButton: ?, opt_button: ?) Clicks a mouse button. If an element is provided, the mouse will first be moved to the center of that element. This is equivalent to WebElement.click(). actionsequence doubleClick(opt_elementOrButton: ?, opt_button: ?) Double-clicks a mouse button. If an element is provided, the mouse will first be moved to the center of that element. actionsequence dragAndDrop(element: ?, location: ?) Convenience function for performing a \"drag and drop\" maneuver. The target element may be moved to the location of another element, or by an offset (in pixels). The location is an object with two properties x and y: {x: x_offset, y: y_offset}. actionsequence keyDown(key: ?) Performs a modifier key press. Must be one of ALT, CONTROL, SHIFT, COMMAND, or META. The modifier key is not released until keyUp() or sendKeys() is called. The key press will be targeted at the currently focused element. actionsequence keyUp(key: ?) Performs a modifier key release. The release is targeted at the currently focused element. actionsequence mouseDown(opt_elementOrButton: ?, opt_button: ?) Presses a mouse button. The mouse button will not be released until mouseUp is called, regardless of whether that call is made in this sequence or another. The behavior for out-of-order events (such as calling mouseDown() or click() when the button is already held down) is undefined. actionsequence mouseUp(opt_elementOrButton: ?, opt_button: ?) Releases a mouse button. Behavior is undefined for calling this function without a previous call to mouseDown(). actionsequence mouseMove(location: ?, offset: ?) Moves the mouse. The location to move to may be specified in terms of the mouse's current location, an offset relative to the top-left corner of an element, or an element (in which case the middle of the element is used). actionsequence perform() Executes this action sequence. promise sendKeys(args: ?) Simulates typing multiple keys. Each modifier key encountered in the sequence will not be released until it is encountered again. All key events will be targeted at the currently focused element. For a full list of supported non-alphanumeric keys, see the WebDriver enum key documentation. actionsequence Promises: Link actions into sequences You can also execute functions directly on promises. Synthetic monitoring is a native Node.js environment and uses standard Node.js promises. These functions evaluate the status of promises, cancel them, and more. In particular, you can create sequences of actions with the then() function and its siblings, thenFinally() and thenCatch(). For more information, see Sequence actions. Function Return value cancel(string: reason) Cancels the computation of this promise's value, rejecting the promise in the process. This method is a no-op if the promise has already been resolved. void isPending() Whether this promise's value is still being computed. boolean then(opt_callback: fn(T: ?), opt_errback: fn()) Registers listeners for when this instance is resolved. This is the basic function used to link synchronous actions in your script. promise thenFinally(callback: fn()) Registers a listener to invoke when this promise is resolved, regardless of whether the promise's value was successfully computed. promise thenCatch(callback: fn()) Registers a listener for when this promise is rejected. promise Navigate: Move through browser history The $browser.navigate() function exposes a number of functions that allow you to move backwards and forwards through your browser history, refresh your page and navigate to new pages. Function Return value back() Move back by one step in the browser's history. void forward() Move forward by one step in the browser's history. void refresh() Refresh the current page. void to(string: url) Load a new webpage in the current browser window. $browser.navigate().to() is equivalent to $browser.get(). void Conditions: Pause and wait for conditions Used with $browser.wait, until pauses your script execution until the condition is matched. For more information on explicit and implicit waits, see the WebDriver documentation. For .wait and .until usage examples, see Webdriver.wait examples. The following are available functions for $driver.until.Condition: Function Return value ableToSwitchToFrame(frame: ?) Creates a condition that will wait until the input driver is able to switch to the designated frame. The target frame may be specified as: A numeric index into window.frames for the current frame A webdriver.WebElement, which must reference a FRAME or IFRAME element on the current page A locator which may be used to first locate a FRAME or IFRAME on the current page before attempting to switch to it Upon successful resolution of this condition, the driver will be left focused on the new frame. condition alertIsPresent() Creates a condition that waits for an alert to be opened. Upon success, the returned promise will be fulfilled with the handle for the opened alert. condition elementIsDisabled(element: $driver.WebElement) Creates a condition that will wait for the given element to be disabled. condition elementIsEnabled(element: $driver.WebElement) Creates a condition that will wait for the given element to be enabled. condition elementIsNotVisible(element: $driver.WebElement) Creates a condition that will wait for the given element to be in the DOM, yet not visible to the user. condition elementIsVisible(element: $driver.WebElement) Creates a condition that will wait for the given element to become visible. condition elementIsSelected(element: $driver.WebElement) Creates a condition that will wait for the given element to be selected. condition elementLocated(element: $driver.Locator) Creates a condition that will loop until an element is found with the given locator. condition elementsLocated(element: $driver.Locator) Creates a condition that will loop until at least one element is found with the given locator. condition elementTextContains(element: $driver.WebElement, substr: string) Creates a condition that will wait for the given element's visible text to contain the given substring. condition elementTextIs(element: $driver.WebElement, text: string) Case sensitive. Creates a condition that will wait for the given element's visible text to match the given text exactly. condition elementTextMatches(element: $driver.WebElement, regex: string) Creates a condition that will wait for the given element's visible text to match a regular expression. condition stalenessOf(element: $driver.WebElement) Creates a condition that will wait for the given element to become stale. An element is considered stale once it is removed from the DOM, or a new page has loaded. condition titleContains(substr: string) Creates a condition that will wait for the current page's title to contain the given substring. condition titleIs(title: string) Creates a condition that will wait for the current page's title to match the given value. condition titleMatches(regex: string) Creates a condition that will wait for the current page's title to match the given regular expression. condition",

      "body": "Read on to learn about synthetic monitoring's proxy settings and properties. Proxy settings API for scripted monitors Important You can set proxy server configuration for synthetic scripted monitors for monitor versions 0.4.0 or higher. The global object $network allows you to control the network configuration used by your synthetic scripted monitors. The following are applicable for both scripted browsers and API tests, unless otherwise stated. $network.setProxy(string or object PROXY URL) Sets a proxy server to be used for all per-URL requests (HTTP, HTTPS, and FTP). Additional notes: The port is optional. If not provided, it will be derived from the scheme. For example, for HTTP the port would be 80. The username and password are assumed to be the result of a call to encodeURIComponent(). Special characters like @ and : in the username and/or the password must be escaped. Returns This method returns a Promise that will resolve once the configuration has been applied. Parameters Parameter Data Type Description proxyURL | proxyUrlParsed String or Object The URL to connect to the proxy server. A string containing a proxyURL (for example, http://proxy_host:8888) or a plain object in the same format as defined by Node's url.parse(urlString) method. Examples An example of setting a proxy server with HTTP protocol on port 1234 with no authentication: $network.setProxy('http://host.com:1234') Copy An example of setting a proxy server with HTTP protocol with authentication credentials. $network.setProxy('http://proxyUsername:proxyPassword@proxyHost:1234') Copy $network.setProxyForHttp(string or object PROXY URL) Tip This call is exactly the same as the per-URL setProxy call, except that it applies to HTTP traffic. Sets a proxy server to be used for all HTTP requests. Additional notes: The port is optional. If not provided, it will be derived from the scheme. For example, for HTTP the port would be 80. The username and password are assumed to be the result of a call to encodeURIComponent(). Special characters like @ and : in the username and/or the password must be escaped. Returns This method returns a Promise that will resolve once the configuration has been applied. Parameters Parameter Data Type Description proxyURL | proxyUrlParsed String or Object The URL to connect to the proxy server. A string containing a proxyURL (for example, http://proxy_host:8888) or a plain object in the same format as defined by Node's url.parse(urlString) method. Examples An example of setting a proxy server with HTTP protocol on port 1234 with no authentication: $network.setProxyForHttp('http://host.com:1234') Copy An example of setting a proxy server with HTTP protocol with authentication credentials. $network.setProxyForHttp('http://proxyUsername:proxyPassword@proxyHost:1234') Copy $network.setProxyForHttps(string or object PROXY URL) Tip This call is exactly the same as the per-URL setProxy call, except that it applies to HTTPS traffic. Sets a proxy server to be used for all HTTPS requests. Additional notes: The port is optional. If not provided, it will be derived from the scheme. For example, for HTTP the default port would be 443. The username and password are assumed to be the result of a call to encodeURIComponent(). Special characters like @ and : in the username and/or the password must be escaped. Returns This method returns a Promise that will resolve once the configuration has been applied. Parameters Parameter Data Type Description proxyURL | proxyUrlParsed String or Object The URL to connect to the proxy server. A string containing a proxyURL (for example, http://proxy_host:8888) or a plain object in the same format as defined by Node's url.parse(urlString) method. Examples An example of setting a proxy server with HTTPS protocol on port 1234 with no authentication: $network.setProxyForHttps('https://host.com:1234') Copy An example of setting a proxy server with HTTPS protocol with authentication credentials. $network.setProxyForHttps('https://proxyUsername:proxyPassword@proxyHost:1234') Copy $network.setProxyPAC(string PAC SCRIPT URL, object AUTH OBJECT) Sets a proxy server via a proxy auto-config (PAC) script and returns a promise. This function is only available for scripted browser monitors. Returns This method returns a Promise that will resolve once the configuration has been applied. Parameters Parameter Data Type Description scriptURL String The URL of the PAC script. authCredentialsMap Object Map of authentication credentials to be provided to the proxy server(s), keyed by the hostnames of the proxy server. Values of this map must be defined in the format {username: 'authUsername', password: 'authPassword'} Examples An example of setting a proxy server via a proxy auto-config (PAC) script: var authCredentialsMap = { 'example.com': {username: 'authUsername', password: 'authPassword'}, } Copy Here's an example of setting up a proxied network via proxy auto-config (PAC) script: var authCredentialsMap = { 'example.com': {username: 'authUsername', password: 'authPassword'}, 'anotherExample.com': {username: 'authUsername', password: 'authPassword'}, } $network.setProxyPAC(\"https://www.example.com/pacScript\", authCredentialsMap) Copy $network.setProxyAdvanced(object PROXY RULES OBJECT) Tip This method is Chrome-specific: it only applies to scripted browser monitor types. It can be used to allow for a more flexible and complex proxy configuration. In most cases, this method will not be needed. Sets the proxy configuration using the format supported by Chrome Extension API for Proxying. The input is a ProxyRules object, as defined by the Chrome Extension API to configures proxies. You can add authCredentials for proxies that need it. See Parameters for more details. Returns This method returns a Promise that will resolve once the configuration has been applied. Parameters Parameter Data Type Description ProxyRules Object Object The proxyRulesObject is a plain object that follows the format ProxyRules as defined by the Chrome Extension API to configures proxies. This object is \"flavoured\" to fit our runtime: users can define an additional property, authCredentials, for the Proxy server objects to provide authentication credentials for a specific proxy server. authCredentials is an object in the format {username: 'authUsername', password: 'authPassword'}. Examples Here's an example of creating a proxyRules with authCredentials: var proxyRules = { singleProxy: { host:\"example.com\", authCredentials: { username: 'authUsername', password: 'authPassword' } } }; Copy Here's an example of setting up a proxied network with mixed network zone assets: var proxyRules = {singleProxy: {host:\"http://entproxy.mycompany.com\"}, bypassList:['s3.amazonaws.com','*.localcdn.com'] } $network.setProxyAdvanced(proxyRules) Copy $network.clearProxy() Clears/removes the current proxy configuration. Returns This method returns a Promise that will resolve once the configuration has been applied. $network.getProxy() This method returns the current proxy configuration. It must be synchronized in a promise callback. Examples An example of synchronizing getProxy with $network.setProxy(); and $network.clearProxy();: var assert = require('assert'); $network.setProxy(\"http://user:password@myproxyurl.com\") .then(function () { console.log('Proxy configuration applied'); //Note: $network.getProxy() is not synchronized with the webdriver Control Flow. //To make sure we get the proxy configuration after the call to setProxy() above // succeeds we need to use a promise callback var proxyData = $network.getProxy(); console.log(proxyData); }) .then(function () { // Again: getProxy() is not synchronized with the Webdriver Control Flow: we //need this promise callback otherwise clearProxy() might be called before the call // to getProxy() above returns return $network.clearProxy(); }) .then(function () { console.log('Proxy configuration cleared'); // We need this promise callback for reasons explained above var proxyData = $network.getProxy(); assert.equal(proxyData.rules, null); }); Copy Proxy properties Important This proxy information applies only to these versions: API monitors: 0.4.0, 0.2.2, 0.2.1, 0.1.0 Scripted monitors: 0.1.0 In order to analyze and collect your HTTP traffic metrics, New Relic must ensure the traffic passes through a conceptual funnel. Our synthetic monitoring includes a software funnel component capable of analyzing the HTTP requests or responses and then recording the information. New Relic's scripted browser monitors (versions 0.4.x and lower) include a mechanism to do this analysis without needing an HTTP proxy, so you don't have to configure anything. New Relic's API test (versions 0.4.x and lower) provides an $http object that is pre-configured to make the requests pass through the internal HTTP proxy. This allows you to write your test without including any proxy settings. If you want to use some other way to generate HTTP traffic while still collecting the HTTP traffic metrics, you can use $env.PROXY_HOST and $env.PROXY_PORT. To record traffic metrics, be sure to include these properties in your script.",

      "body": "Use synthetic monitoring's API tests to monitor your API endpoint to ensure it is functioning correctly. New Relic uses the http-request module internally to make HTTP calls to your endpoint and validate the results. Here we present some example functions showing how to use the $http object to submit your request. For detailed documentation on the options available for this object, see the http-request readme. (Note that Request is deprecated, but these options still apply.) Tip To view and share other API test examples, visit the synthetics scripts section in Explorers Hub. Use API http-request module API tests are powered by the http-request module, which is available through the $http object. Once each frequency interval, New Relic queries your endpoint from each of your selected locations. For instructions on creating a monitor, see Adding monitors. Read on to learn how to define metadata for your request, make a GET request, make a POST request, and how to validate the results. Important After a maximum run time of three minutes, New Relic manually stops the script. one.newrelic.com > Synthetics > Create monitor: The script editor suggests functions, selectors, and other elements to simplify scripting commands (available in GitHub). Configure request options To start your script: Declare a variable (such as options) to store your request options object. Define request options such as the URL endpoint, and custom headers. If you're setting SSL or agent options, see SSL and agentOptions requirements. We recommend using SSL to avoid exposing plain text credentials in your headers. Tip For a full list of supported request options, see request(options, callback) in the http-request documentation on GitHub. Here's an example of optional metadata in the options object: Using optional metadata //Declare optional metadata var options = { //Specify the endpoint URL url: 'https://api-endpoint.example.com', //Specify optional headers headers: { 'Endpoint-Key': 'uqNTC57Phe72pnnB8JuJmwAr7b09nKSKSz', 'Additional-Header': 'Additional-Header-Data' } }; Copy For SSL and agentOptions: If you are setting SSL options or providing an agentOptions object, the agent property in the request options object will need to be set to $globalAgents.https or $globalAgents.http to ensure your HTTP requests use the instrumented global agent. Here's an example of using a SSL option or agentOptions: Using a SSL option or agentOptions This example uses agentOptions: //Declare optional metadata var options = { //Specify the endpoint URL url: 'https://api-endpoint.example.com', //Specify optional headers headers: { 'Endpoint-Key': 'uqNTC57Phe72pnnB8JuJmwAr7b09nKSKSz', 'Additional-Header': 'Additional-Header-Data' } //Specify global agent as the http agent agent: $globalAgents.https, //Set SSL option strictSSL: true, //Specify http agent options agentOptions: { ​maxVersion: 'TLSv1.1' }, }; Copy Send a GET request To make a GET request, use the $http.get method to submit your request. Define your request options, make your request using $http.get, then validate the response to ensure your endpoint is returning the correct results. Insights GET example This example queries the Insights API by using GET: //Define your authentication credentials var myAccountID = '{YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID}'; var myQueryKey = '{YOUR_QUERY_KEY}'; var options = { //Define endpoint URI uri: 'https://insights-api.newrelic.com/v1/accounts/'+myAccountID+'/query?nrql=SELECT%20average(duration)%20FROM%20Transaction', //Define query key and expected data type. headers: { 'X-Query-Key': myQueryKey, 'Accept': 'application/json' } }; //Define expected results using callback function. function callback (err, response, body){ //Log JSON results from endpoint to Synthetics console. console.log(JSON.parse(body)); console.log('done with script'); } //Make GET request, passing in options and callback. $http.get(options,callback); Copy Send a POST request To make a POST request, use the $http.post method to submit your request. Define your request options, make your request using $http.post, then validate the response to ensure your endpoint is returning the correct results. Custom event POST example This example POSTs a custom event containing static integers to the Event API: //Define your authentication credentials. var myAccountID = '{YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID}'; var myLicenseKey = '{YOUR_LICENSE_KEY}'; //Import the 'assert' module to validate results. var assert = require('assert'); var options = { //Define endpoint URL. url: \"https://insights-collector.newrelic.com/v1/accounts/\"+myAccountID+\"/events\", //Define body of POST request. body: '[{\"eventType\":\"SyntheticsEvent\",\"integer1\":1000,\"integer2\":2000}]', //Define New Relic license key and expected data type. headers: { 'Api-Key': myLicenseKey, 'Content-Type': 'application/json' } }; //Define expected results using callback function. function callback(error, response, body) { //Log status code to Synthetics console. console.log(response.statusCode + \" status code\") //Verify endpoint returns 200 (OK) response code. assert.ok(response.statusCode == 200, 'Expected 200 OK response'); //Parse JSON received from Insights into variable. var info = JSON.parse(body); //Verify that `info` contains element named `success` with a value of `true`. assert.ok(info.success == true, 'Expected True results in Response Body, result was ' + info.success); //Log end of script. console.log(\"End reached\"); } //Make POST request, passing in options and callback. $http.post(options, callback); Copy Validate results To validate your results, import the assert module to define your test case. Call an assert method to validate your endpoint's response. If any assert functions fail, the entire monitor will be considered a failed check. This may trigger alert notifications and affect your metrics. Important Synthetic monitoring does not allow thrown exceptions. Thrown exceptions result in script failure. Use the assert module to validate your results, and use console.log() to log results to the synthetic's console. Event API validation example This example POSTs to the Event API, then validates that the response is {\"success\":true}: //Define your authentication credentials. var myAccountID = '{YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID}'; var myLicenseKey = '{YOUR_LICENSE_KEY}'; //Import the `assert` module to validate results. var assert = require('assert'); var options = { //Define endpoint URL. url: \"https://insights-collector.newrelic.com/v1/accounts/\"+myAccountID+\"/events\", //Define body of POST request. body: '[{\"eventType\":\"SyntheticsEvent\",\"integer1\":1000,\"integer2\":2000}]', //Define New Relic license key and expected data type. headers: { 'Api-Key': myLicenseKey, 'Content-Type': 'application/json' } }; $http.post(options, function(error, response, body) { //Log status code to Synthetics console. The status code is logged before the `assert` function, //because a failed assert function ends the script. console.log(response.statusCode + \" status code\") //Call `assert` method, expecting a `200` response code. //If assertion fails, log `Expected 200 OK response` as error message to Synthetics console. assert.ok(response.statusCode == 200, 'Expected 200 OK response'); var info = JSON.parse(body); //Call `assert` method, expecting body to return `{\"success\":true}`. //If assertion fails, log `Expected True results in Response Body,` plus results as error message to Synthetics console. assert.ok(info.success == true, 'Expected True results in Response Body, result was ' + info.success); }); Copy",

      "body": "This document is for synthetic monitor versions 0.4.x or lower. See also the documentation for Synthetic monitor versions 0.5 or higher. Overview Synthetic scripted browsers provide you access to the Selenium Webdriver APIs 2.47.0 via the variables $driver and $browser. In particular: $driver provides all the exports from the selenium-webdriver module (for example, ActionSequence, Button, By, WebElement, etc.). $browser is a synthetic-flavored instance of selenium-webdriver.WebDriver(): it exposes the main basic WebDriver APIs like get() and findElement(), as well as some synthetic custom APIs. This document describes the functions available for synthetic scripted browser monitors version 0.4.0 or lower. For the newest monitor documentation, see monitor version 0.5.0+ documentation. Other relevant documentation: For more on synthetic scripting, see Write scripted browsers. For example scripts, see Scripted browser examples. For more information about monitor versions and runtime differences, see Runtime environments. To view and share scripted browser examples, check out topics tagged synthetic-script in New Relic's Explorers Hub. Top-level functions: Build your script New Relic calls top-level functions directly from your $browser instance. These provide a wide range of functionality that covers many basic scriptable actions. Function Return value $browser.actions() Creates a new action sequence using this driver. For a list of available actions, see ActionSequence: Link multiple actions. void $browser.addHeader(headerKey: string, headerValue: string) Adds header headerKey with value headerValue to the runtime. void $browser.addHeaders(headers: ?) Adds a map of headers to the runtime. void $browser.deleteHeader(header: string) Deletes a specific header from the runtime. void $browser.deleteHeaders(header: [string]) Deletes all headers in argument from runtime. void $browser.addHostnameToBlacklist(hostname: string) Disallows a hostname. Allows use wildcards. void $browser.addHostnamesToBlacklist(hostnameArr: [string]) Disallows all hostnames in an array of arguments. Allows use wildcards. void $browser.addHostnameToWhitelist(hostname: string) Allows a hostname blocked by default in synthetic monitoring. void $browser.addHostnamesToWhitelist(hostnameArr: [string]) Allows all hostnames in argument. void $browser.deleteHostnameFromBlacklist(hostname: string) Removes a hostname from this browser instance's blacklist. void $browser.deleteHostnamesFromBlacklist(hostnameArr: [string]) Removes all hostnames in argument from the disallowed list. void $browser.deleteHostnameFromWhitelist(hostnameArr: [string]) Removes a hostname from this browser instance's allowed list. void $browser.deleteHostnamesFromWhitelist(hostnameArr: [string]) Removes all hostnames in argument from this browser instance's allowed list. void $browser.executeAsyncScript(script: ?, var_args: ?) Schedules a command to execute asynchronous JavaScript in the context of the currently selected frame or window. promise $browser.executeScript(script: ?, var_args: ?) Schedules a command to execute JavaScript in the context of the currently selected frame or window. promise $browser.findElement(locator: $driver.Locator) Schedule a command to find an element on the page. If not found, New Relic returns an error. WebElement $browser.findElements(locator: $driver.Locator) Schedule a command to search for multiple elements on the page. promise $browser.waitForAndFindElement(locator: $driver.Locator [, timeout: number) Schedule a command to wait for and find an element on the page, and another command to wait for it to be visible. If not found, New Relic returns an error. The timeout value is an optional one, and gets applied separately to both tasks of finding the element and waiting for its visibility. This means at worst case, this method can take up to twice the provided timeout value. The default timeout value is 1000 ms (1 second). promise $browser.get(url: string) Loads a webpage in a synthetic browser. promise $browser.getAllWindowHandles() Schedules a command to retrieve the current list of available window handles. promise $browser.getCapabilities() A promise that will resolve with the instance's capabilities. promise $browser.getCurrentUrl() Schedules a command to retrieve the URL of the current page. promise $browser.getHeaders() Returns a map of currently configured headers. map $browser.getPageSource() Schedules a command to retrieve the current page's source. The page source returned is a representation of the underlying DOM; do not expect it to be formatted or escaped in the same way as the response sent from the web server. promise $browser.getSession() A promise for this client's session. promise $browser.getTitle() Schedules a command to retrieve the current page's title. promise $browser.getWindowHandle() Schedules a command to retrieve the current window handle. promise $browser.isElementPresent(locatorOrElement: $driver.Locator) Schedules a command to test if an element is present on the page. If given a DOM element, this function will check if it belongs to the document the driver is currently focused on. Otherwise, the function will test if at least one element can be found with the given search criteria. promise $browser.manage() The options interface for this instance. You can manage cookies, timeouts, and other window options. void $browser.navigate() The navigation interface (history of browser functions) for this instance. void $browser.schedule(command: ?, description: string) Schedules a command to be executed by this driver's CommandExecutor. promise $browser.sleep() Schedules a command to make the driver sleep for the given amount of time. promise $browser.switchTo() The target locator interface for this instance. void $browser.takeScreenshot() Schedule a command to take a screenshot. promise $browser.wait(fn: $driver.until.Condition, timeout: number, opt_message: string) Schedules a command to wait for a condition to hold, as defined by some user supplied function. webElement $browser.waitForPendingRequests(timeout: number) Causes the script to wait for requests that have been initiated to return, up to the timeout. Useful for tracking non-blocking resources. promise Disallow list: Wildcard use Disallowing domains for your browser instance requires wildcards to match the URL syntax of the URL to be blocked. An overall .com disallowed list needs to contain these functions: Function Blocking action $browser.addHostnameToBlacklist('*.com'); a.com $browser.addHostnameToBlacklist('*.*.com'); a.b.com $browser.addHostnameToBlacklist('*.*.*.com'); a.b.c.com $browser.addHostnameToBlacklist('www.*.com'); www.a.com $browser.addHostnameToBlacklist('www.*.*.com'); www.a.b.com $browser.addHostnameToBlacklist('www.*.*.*.com'); www.a.b.c.com Options: Manage the browser instance These functions manage options for your browser instance such as cookies, timeouts and window size. Access these options through the $browser.manage() function. Function Return value $browser.manage().addCookie(name: string, value: string, opt_path: string, opt_domain: string, opt_isSecure: boolean, opt_expiry: number) Schedules a command to add a cookie. promise $browser.manage().deleteAllCookies() Schedules a command to delete all cookies visible to the current page. promise $browser.manage().deleteCookie(name: string) Schedules a command to delete the cookie with the given name. This command is a no-op if there is no cookie with the given name visible to the current page. promise $browser.manage().getCookie(name: string) Schedules a command to retrieve the cookie with the given name. Returns null if there is no such cookie. The cookie will be returned as a JSON object as described by the WebDriver wire protocol. promise $browser.manage().getCookies() Schedules a command to retrieve all cookies visible to the current page. New Relic Syntheticcs returns each cookie as a JSON object as described by the WebDriver wire protocol. promise $browser.manage().timeouts().implicitlyWait(ms: number) Specifies the amount of time the driver should wait when searching for an element if it is not immediately present. Setting the wait timeout to 0 disables implicit waiting. Be careful increasing the wait timeout, as it will increase test run time, especially with slower location strategies like XPath. Default is 10 seconds. promise $browser.manage().timeouts().pageLoadTimeout(ms: number) Sets the amount of time to wait for a page load to complete before returning an error. If the timeout is negative, page loads may last up to 180 seconds. Default is 60 seconds. promise $browser.manage().timeouts().setScriptTimeout(ms: number) Sets the amount of time to wait, in milliseconds, for an asynchronous script to finish execution before returning an error. Default is 30 seconds. promise $browser.manage().window().getPosition() Retrieves the window's current position, relative to the top left corner of the screen. promise $browser.manage().window().getSize() Retrieves the window's current size. promise $browser.manage().window().maximize() Maximizes the current window. promise $browser.manage().window().setPosition(x: number, y: number) Repositions the current window. promise $browser.manage().window().setSize(width: number, height: number) Resizes the current window. promise Locators: Find page elements Locators are a collection of factory functions for creating locator instances. Locators find DOM elements, which can be passed to functions such as $browser.findElement or $browser.isElementPresent. Call them through $driver.By. Function Return value $driver.By.className(className: string) Locates an element that has a specific class name. The returned locator is equivalent to searching for elements with the CSS selector .clazz. locator $driver.By.css(cssName: string) Locates an element using a CSS selector. locator $driver.By.id(id: string) Locates an element by its ID. locator $driver.By.linkText(linkText: string) Locates link elements whose visible text matches the given string. locator $driver.By.js(js: string) Locates an element by evaluating a JavaScript expression. locator $driver.By.name(name: string) Locates elements whose name attribute has the given value. locator $driver.By.partialLinkText(partialLinkText: string) Locates link elements whose getText visible contains the given substring. locator $driver.By.tagName(tagName: string) Locates elements with a given tag name. The returned locator is equivalent to using the getElementsByTagName DOM function. locator $driver.By.xpath(xpath: string) Locates elements matching a XPath selector. locator WebElement: Interact with page elements When a function such as $browser.findElement or $browser.waitForAndFindElement returns a WebElement reference, these functions can be used to interact with that element. Using these, you can click on buttons, sent text to form inputs, and get attributes of elements to test. Function Return value click() Clicks on this element. void sendKeys(var_args: ?) Schedules a command to type a sequence on the DOM element represented by this instance. WebElement getTagName() Schedules a command to query for the tag/node name of this element. WebElement getCssValue(name: string) Schedules a command to query for the computed style of the element represented by this instance. If the element inherits the named style from its parent, the parent will be queried for its value. Where possible, color values will be converted to their hex representation (for example, #00ff00 instead of rgb(0, 255, 0)). promise getAttribute(name: string) Schedules a command to query for the value of the given attribute of the element. promise getText(name: string) Get the visible (not hidden by CSS) innerText of this element, including sub-elements, without any leading or trailing white space. promise getSize() Schedules a command to compute the size of this element's bounding box, in pixels. promise getLocation() Schedules a command to compute the location of this element, in page space. promise isEnabled() Schedules a command to query whether the DOM element represented by this instance is enabled, as dictated by the disabled attribute. promise isSelected() Schedules a command to query whether this element is selected. promise submit() Schedules a command to submit the form containing this element (or this element if it is a FORM element). This command is a no-op if the element is not contained in a form. promise clear() Schedules a command to clear the value of this element. promise isDisplayed() Schedules a command to test whether this element is currently displayed. promise getOuterHtml() Schedules a command to retrieve the outer HTML of this element. promise getInnerHtml() Schedules a command to retrieve the inner HTML of this element. promise ActionSequence: Link multiple actions Action sequences can create complex user interactions with your website. To create a new action sequence, use $browser.actions(). To link multiple actions together into a sequence, include perform() after each. This executes and then terminates individual sequences, including single-action sequences. The following table contains a list of available actions. For more information, see the WebDriver ActionSequence documentation. Function Return value click(opt_elementOrButton: ?, opt_button: ?) Clicks a mouse button. If an element is provided, the mouse will first be moved to the center of that element. This is equivalent to WebElement.click(). actionsequence doubleClick(opt_elementOrButton: ?, opt_button: ?) Double-clicks a mouse button. If an element is provided, the mouse will first be moved to the center of that element. actionsequence dragAndDrop(element: ?, location: ?) Convenience function for performing a \"drag and drop\" maneuver. The target element may be moved to the location of another element, or by an offset (in pixels). The location is an object with two properties x and y: {x: x_offset, y: y_offset}. actionsequence keyDown(key: ?) Performs a modifier key press. Must be one of ALT, CONTROL, SHIFT, COMMAND, or META. The modifier key is not released until keyUp() or sendKeys() is called. The key press will be targeted at the currently focused element. actionsequence keyUp(key: ?) Performs a modifier key release. The release is targeted at the currently focused element. actionsequence mouseDown(opt_elementOrButton: ?, opt_button: ?) Presses a mouse button. The mouse button will not be released until mouseUp is called, regardless of whether that call is made in this sequence or another. The behavior for out-of-order events (such as calling mouseDown() or click() when the button is already held down) is undefined. actionsequence mouseUp(opt_elementOrButton: ?, opt_button: ?) Releases a mouse button. Behavior is undefined for calling this function without a previous call to mouseDown(). actionsequence mouseMove(location: ?, offset: ?) Moves the mouse. The location to move to may be specified in terms of the mouse's current location, an offset relative to the top-left corner of an element, or an element (in which case the middle of the element is used). actionsequence perform() Executes this action sequence. promise sendKeys(args: ?) Simulates typing multiple keys. Each modifier key encountered in the sequence will not be released until it is encountered again. All key events will be targeted at the currently focused element. For a full list of supported non-alphanumeric keys, see the WebDriver enum key documentation. actionsequence Promises: Link actions into sequences You can also execute functions directly on promises. Synthetic monitoring is a native Node.js environment and uses standard Node.js promises. These functions evaluate the status of promises, cancel them, and more. In particular, you can create sequences of actions with the then() function and its siblings, thenFinally() and thenCatch(). For more information, see Sequence actions. Function Return value cancel(string: reason) Cancels the computation of this promise's value, rejecting the promise in the process. This method is a no-op if the promise has already been resolved. void isPending() Whether this promise's value is still being computed. boolean then(opt_callback: fn(T: ?), opt_errback: fn()) Registers listeners for when this instance is resolved. This is the basic function used to link synchronous actions in your script. promise thenFinally(callback: fn()) Registers a listener to invoke when this promise is resolved, regardless of whether the promise's value was successfully computed. promise thenCatch(callback: fn()) Registers a listener for when this promise is rejected. promise Navigate: Move through browser history The $browser.navigate() function exposes a number of functions that allow you to move backwards and forwards through your browser history, refresh your page and navigate to new pages. Function Return value back() Move back by one step in the browser's history. void forward() Move forward by one step in the browser's history. void refresh() Refresh the current page. void to(string: url) Load a new webpage in the current browser window. $browser.navigate().to() is equivalent to $browser.get(). void Conditions: Pause and wait for conditions Used with $browser.wait, until pauses your script execution until the condition is matched. For more information on explicit and implicit waits, see the WebDriver documentation. For .wait and .until usage examples, see Webdriver.wait examples. The following are available functions for $driver.until.Condition: Function Return value ableToSwitchToFrame(frame: ?) Creates a condition that will wait until the input driver is able to switch to the designated frame. The target frame may be specified as: A numeric index into window.frames for the current frame A webdriver.WebElement, which must reference a FRAME or IFRAME element on the current page A locator which may be used to first locate a FRAME or IFRAME on the current page before attempting to switch to it Upon successful resolution of this condition, the driver will be left focused on the new frame. condition alertIsPresent() Creates a condition that waits for an alert to be opened. Upon success, the returned promise will be fulfilled with the handle for the opened alert. condition elementIsDisabled(element: $driver.WebElement) Creates a condition that will wait for the given element to be disabled. condition elementIsEnabled(element: $driver.WebElement) Creates a condition that will wait for the given element to be enabled. condition elementIsNotVisible(element: $driver.WebElement) Creates a condition that will wait for the given element to be in the DOM, yet not visible to the user. condition elementIsVisible(element: $driver.WebElement) Creates a condition that will wait for the given element to become visible. condition elementIsSelected(element: $driver.WebElement) Creates a condition that will wait for the given element to be selected. condition elementLocated(element: $driver.Locator) Creates a condition that will loop until an element is found with the given locator. condition elementsLocated(element: $driver.Locator) Creates a condition that will loop until at least one element is found with the given locator. condition elementTextContains(element: $driver.WebElement, substr: string) Creates a condition that will wait for the given element's visible text to contain the given substring. condition elementTextIs(element: $driver.WebElement, text: string) Case sensitive. Creates a condition that will wait for the given element's visible text to match the given text exactly. condition elementTextMatches(element: $driver.WebElement, regex: string) Creates a condition that will wait for the given element's visible text to match a regular expression. condition stalenessOf(element: $driver.WebElement) Creates a condition that will wait for the given element to become stale. An element is considered stale once it is removed from the DOM, or a new page has loaded. condition titleContains(substr: string) Creates a condition that will wait for the current page's title to contain the given substring. condition titleIs(title: string) Creates a condition that will wait for the current page's title to match the given value. condition titleMatches(regex: string) Creates a condition that will wait for the current page's title to match the given regular expression. condition",

      "body": "Read on to learn about synthetic monitoring's proxy settings and properties. Proxy settings API for scripted monitors Important You can set proxy server configuration for synthetic scripted monitors for monitor versions 0.4.0 or higher. The global object $network allows you to control the network configuration used by your synthetic scripted monitors. The following are applicable for both scripted browsers and API tests, unless otherwise stated. $network.setProxy(string or object PROXY URL) Sets a proxy server to be used for all per-URL requests (HTTP, HTTPS, and FTP). Additional notes: The port is optional. If not provided, it will be derived from the scheme. For example, for HTTP the port would be 80. The username and password are assumed to be the result of a call to encodeURIComponent(). Special characters like @ and : in the username and/or the password must be escaped. Returns This method returns a Promise that will resolve once the configuration has been applied. Parameters Parameter Data Type Description proxyURL | proxyUrlParsed String or Object The URL to connect to the proxy server. A string containing a proxyURL (for example, http://proxy_host:8888) or a plain object in the same format as defined by Node's url.parse(urlString) method. Examples An example of setting a proxy server with HTTP protocol on port 1234 with no authentication: $network.setProxy('http://host.com:1234') Copy An example of setting a proxy server with HTTP protocol with authentication credentials. $network.setProxy('http://proxyUsername:proxyPassword@proxyHost:1234') Copy $network.setProxyForHttp(string or object PROXY URL) Tip This call is exactly the same as the per-URL setProxy call, except that it applies to HTTP traffic. Sets a proxy server to be used for all HTTP requests. Additional notes: The port is optional. If not provided, it will be derived from the scheme. For example, for HTTP the port would be 80. The username and password are assumed to be the result of a call to encodeURIComponent(). Special characters like @ and : in the username and/or the password must be escaped. Returns This method returns a Promise that will resolve once the configuration has been applied. Parameters Parameter Data Type Description proxyURL | proxyUrlParsed String or Object The URL to connect to the proxy server. A string containing a proxyURL (for example, http://proxy_host:8888) or a plain object in the same format as defined by Node's url.parse(urlString) method. Examples An example of setting a proxy server with HTTP protocol on port 1234 with no authentication: $network.setProxyForHttp('http://host.com:1234') Copy An example of setting a proxy server with HTTP protocol with authentication credentials. $network.setProxyForHttp('http://proxyUsername:proxyPassword@proxyHost:1234') Copy $network.setProxyForHttps(string or object PROXY URL) Tip This call is exactly the same as the per-URL setProxy call, except that it applies to HTTPS traffic. Sets a proxy server to be used for all HTTPS requests. Additional notes: The port is optional. If not provided, it will be derived from the scheme. For example, for HTTP the default port would be 443. The username and password are assumed to be the result of a call to encodeURIComponent(). Special characters like @ and : in the username and/or the password must be escaped. Returns This method returns a Promise that will resolve once the configuration has been applied. Parameters Parameter Data Type Description proxyURL | proxyUrlParsed String or Object The URL to connect to the proxy server. A string containing a proxyURL (for example, http://proxy_host:8888) or a plain object in the same format as defined by Node's url.parse(urlString) method. Examples An example of setting a proxy server with HTTPS protocol on port 1234 with no authentication: $network.setProxyForHttps('https://host.com:1234') Copy An example of setting a proxy server with HTTPS protocol with authentication credentials. $network.setProxyForHttps('https://proxyUsername:proxyPassword@proxyHost:1234') Copy $network.setProxyPAC(string PAC SCRIPT URL, object AUTH OBJECT) Sets a proxy server via a proxy auto-config (PAC) script and returns a promise. This function is only available for scripted browser monitors. Returns This method returns a Promise that will resolve once the configuration has been applied. Parameters Parameter Data Type Description scriptURL String The URL of the PAC script. authCredentialsMap Object Map of authentication credentials to be provided to the proxy server(s), keyed by the hostnames of the proxy server. Values of this map must be defined in the format {username: 'authUsername', password: 'authPassword'} Examples An example of setting a proxy server via a proxy auto-config (PAC) script: var authCredentialsMap = { 'example.com': {username: 'authUsername', password: 'authPassword'}, } Copy Here's an example of setting up a proxied network via proxy auto-config (PAC) script: var authCredentialsMap = { 'example.com': {username: 'authUsername', password: 'authPassword'}, 'anotherExample.com': {username: 'authUsername', password: 'authPassword'}, } $network.setProxyPAC(\"https://www.example.com/pacScript\", authCredentialsMap) Copy $network.setProxyAdvanced(object PROXY RULES OBJECT) Tip This method is Chrome-specific: it only applies to scripted browser monitor types. It can be used to allow for a more flexible and complex proxy configuration. In most cases, this method will not be needed. Sets the proxy configuration using the format supported by Chrome Extension API for Proxying. The input is a ProxyRules object, as defined by the Chrome Extension API to configures proxies. You can add authCredentials for proxies that need it. See Parameters for more details. Returns This method returns a Promise that will resolve once the configuration has been applied. Parameters Parameter Data Type Description ProxyRules Object Object The proxyRulesObject is a plain object that follows the format ProxyRules as defined by the Chrome Extension API to configures proxies. This object is \"flavoured\" to fit our runtime: users can define an additional property, authCredentials, for the Proxy server objects to provide authentication credentials for a specific proxy server. authCredentials is an object in the format {username: 'authUsername', password: 'authPassword'}. Examples Here's an example of creating a proxyRules with authCredentials: var proxyRules = { singleProxy: { host:\"example.com\", authCredentials: { username: 'authUsername', password: 'authPassword' } } }; Copy Here's an example of setting up a proxied network with mixed network zone assets: var proxyRules = {singleProxy: {host:\"http://entproxy.mycompany.com\"}, bypassList:['s3.amazonaws.com','*.localcdn.com'] } $network.setProxyAdvanced(proxyRules) Copy $network.clearProxy() Clears/removes the current proxy configuration. Returns This method returns a Promise that will resolve once the configuration has been applied. $network.getProxy() This method returns the current proxy configuration. It must be synchronized in a promise callback. Examples An example of synchronizing getProxy with $network.setProxy(); and $network.clearProxy();: var assert = require('assert'); $network.setProxy(\"http://user:password@myproxyurl.com\") .then(function () { console.log('Proxy configuration applied'); //Note: $network.getProxy() is not synchronized with the webdriver Control Flow. //To make sure we get the proxy configuration after the call to setProxy() above // succeeds we need to use a promise callback var proxyData = $network.getProxy(); console.log(proxyData); }) .then(function () { // Again: getProxy() is not synchronized with the Webdriver Control Flow: we //need this promise callback otherwise clearProxy() might be called before the call // to getProxy() above returns return $network.clearProxy(); }) .then(function () { console.log('Proxy configuration cleared'); // We need this promise callback for reasons explained above var proxyData = $network.getProxy(); assert.equal(proxyData.rules, null); }); Copy Proxy properties Important This proxy information applies only to these versions: API monitors: 0.4.0, 0.2.2, 0.2.1, 0.1.0 Scripted monitors: 0.1.0 In order to analyze and collect your HTTP traffic metrics, New Relic must ensure the traffic passes through a conceptual funnel. Our synthetic monitoring includes a software funnel component capable of analyzing the HTTP requests or responses and then recording the information. New Relic's scripted browser monitors (versions 0.4.x and lower) include a mechanism to do this analysis without needing an HTTP proxy, so you don't have to configure anything. New Relic's API test (versions 0.4.x and lower) provides an $http object that is pre-configured to make the requests pass through the internal HTTP proxy. This allows you to write your test without including any proxy settings. If you want to use some other way to generate HTTP traffic while still collecting the HTTP traffic metrics, you can use $env.PROXY_HOST and $env.PROXY_PORT. To record traffic metrics, be sure to include these properties in your script.",

      "body": "Use synthetic monitoring's API tests to monitor your API endpoint to ensure it is functioning correctly. New Relic uses the http-request module internally to make HTTP calls to your endpoint and validate the results. Here we present some example functions showing how to use the $http object to submit your request. For detailed documentation on the options available for this object, see the http-request readme. (Note that Request is deprecated, but these options still apply.) Tip To view and share other API test examples, visit the synthetics scripts section in Explorers Hub. Use API http-request module API tests are powered by the http-request module, which is available through the $http object. Once each frequency interval, New Relic queries your endpoint from each of your selected locations. For instructions on creating a monitor, see Adding monitors. Read on to learn how to define metadata for your request, make a GET request, make a POST request, and how to validate the results. Important After a maximum run time of three minutes, New Relic manually stops the script. one.newrelic.com > Synthetics > Create monitor: The script editor suggests functions, selectors, and other elements to simplify scripting commands (available in GitHub). Configure request options To start your script: Declare a variable (such as options) to store your request options object. Define request options such as the URL endpoint, and custom headers. If you're setting SSL or agent options, see SSL and agentOptions requirements. We recommend using SSL to avoid exposing plain text credentials in your headers. Tip For a full list of supported request options, see request(options, callback) in the http-request documentation on GitHub. Here's an example of optional metadata in the options object: Using optional metadata //Declare optional metadata var options = { //Specify the endpoint URL url: 'https://api-endpoint.example.com', //Specify optional headers headers: { 'Endpoint-Key': 'uqNTC57Phe72pnnB8JuJmwAr7b09nKSKSz', 'Additional-Header': 'Additional-Header-Data' } }; Copy For SSL and agentOptions: If you are setting SSL options or providing an agentOptions object, the agent property in the request options object will need to be set to $globalAgents.https or $globalAgents.http to ensure your HTTP requests use the instrumented global agent. Here's an example of using a SSL option or agentOptions: Using a SSL option or agentOptions This example uses agentOptions: //Declare optional metadata var options = { //Specify the endpoint URL url: 'https://api-endpoint.example.com', //Specify optional headers headers: { 'Endpoint-Key': 'uqNTC57Phe72pnnB8JuJmwAr7b09nKSKSz', 'Additional-Header': 'Additional-Header-Data' } //Specify global agent as the http agent agent: $globalAgents.https, //Set SSL option strictSSL: true, //Specify http agent options agentOptions: { ​maxVersion: 'TLSv1.1' }, }; Copy Send a GET request To make a GET request, use the $http.get method to submit your request. Define your request options, make your request using $http.get, then validate the response to ensure your endpoint is returning the correct results. Insights GET example This example queries the Insights API by using GET: //Define your authentication credentials var myAccountID = '{YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID}'; var myQueryKey = '{YOUR_QUERY_KEY}'; var options = { //Define endpoint URI uri: 'https://insights-api.newrelic.com/v1/accounts/'+myAccountID+'/query?nrql=SELECT%20average(duration)%20FROM%20Transaction', //Define query key and expected data type. headers: { 'X-Query-Key': myQueryKey, 'Accept': 'application/json' } }; //Define expected results using callback function. function callback (err, response, body){ //Log JSON results from endpoint to Synthetics console. console.log(JSON.parse(body)); console.log('done with script'); } //Make GET request, passing in options and callback. $http.get(options,callback); Copy Send a POST request To make a POST request, use the $http.post method to submit your request. Define your request options, make your request using $http.post, then validate the response to ensure your endpoint is returning the correct results. Custom event POST example This example POSTs a custom event containing static integers to the Event API: //Define your authentication credentials. var myAccountID = '{YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID}'; var myLicenseKey = '{YOUR_LICENSE_KEY}'; //Import the 'assert' module to validate results. var assert = require('assert'); var options = { //Define endpoint URL. url: \"https://insights-collector.newrelic.com/v1/accounts/\"+myAccountID+\"/events\", //Define body of POST request. body: '[{\"eventType\":\"SyntheticsEvent\",\"integer1\":1000,\"integer2\":2000}]', //Define New Relic license key and expected data type. headers: { 'Api-Key': myLicenseKey, 'Content-Type': 'application/json' } }; //Define expected results using callback function. function callback(error, response, body) { //Log status code to Synthetics console. console.log(response.statusCode + \" status code\") //Verify endpoint returns 200 (OK) response code. assert.ok(response.statusCode == 200, 'Expected 200 OK response'); //Parse JSON received from Insights into variable. var info = JSON.parse(body); //Verify that `info` contains element named `success` with a value of `true`. assert.ok(info.success == true, 'Expected True results in Response Body, result was ' + info.success); //Log end of script. console.log(\"End reached\"); } //Make POST request, passing in options and callback. $http.post(options, callback); Copy Validate results To validate your results, import the assert module to define your test case. Call an assert method to validate your endpoint's response. If any assert functions fail, the entire monitor will be considered a failed check. This may trigger alert notifications and affect your metrics. Important Synthetic monitoring does not allow thrown exceptions. Thrown exceptions result in script failure. Use the assert module to validate your results, and use console.log() to log results to the synthetic's console. Event API validation example This example POSTs to the Event API, then validates that the response is {\"success\":true}: //Define your authentication credentials. var myAccountID = '{YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID}'; var myLicenseKey = '{YOUR_LICENSE_KEY}'; //Import the `assert` module to validate results. var assert = require('assert'); var options = { //Define endpoint URL. url: \"https://insights-collector.newrelic.com/v1/accounts/\"+myAccountID+\"/events\", //Define body of POST request. body: '[{\"eventType\":\"SyntheticsEvent\",\"integer1\":1000,\"integer2\":2000}]', //Define New Relic license key and expected data type. headers: { 'Api-Key': myLicenseKey, 'Content-Type': 'application/json' } }; $http.post(options, function(error, response, body) { //Log status code to Synthetics console. The status code is logged before the `assert` function, //because a failed assert function ends the script. console.log(response.statusCode + \" status code\") //Call `assert` method, expecting a `200` response code. //If assertion fails, log `Expected 200 OK response` as error message to Synthetics console. assert.ok(response.statusCode == 200, 'Expected 200 OK response'); var info = JSON.parse(body); //Call `assert` method, expecting body to return `{\"success\":true}`. //If assertion fails, log `Expected True results in Response Body,` plus results as error message to Synthetics console. assert.ok(info.success == true, 'Expected True results in Response Body, result was ' + info.success); }); Copy",

      "body": "This document is for synthetic monitor versions 0.4.x or lower. See also the documentation for Synthetic monitor versions 0.5 or higher. Overview Synthetic scripted browsers provide you access to the Selenium Webdriver APIs 2.47.0 via the variables $driver and $browser. In particular: $driver provides all the exports from the selenium-webdriver module (for example, ActionSequence, Button, By, WebElement, etc.). $browser is a synthetic-flavored instance of selenium-webdriver.WebDriver(): it exposes the main basic WebDriver APIs like get() and findElement(), as well as some synthetic custom APIs. This document describes the functions available for synthetic scripted browser monitors version 0.4.0 or lower. For the newest monitor documentation, see monitor version 0.5.0+ documentation. Other relevant documentation: For more on synthetic scripting, see Write scripted browsers. For example scripts, see Scripted browser examples. For more information about monitor versions and runtime differences, see Runtime environments. To view and share scripted browser examples, check out topics tagged synthetic-script in New Relic's Explorers Hub. Top-level functions: Build your script New Relic calls top-level functions directly from your $browser instance. These provide a wide range of functionality that covers many basic scriptable actions. Function Return value $browser.actions() Creates a new action sequence using this driver. For a list of available actions, see ActionSequence: Link multiple actions. void $browser.addHeader(headerKey: string, headerValue: string) Adds header headerKey with value headerValue to the runtime. void $browser.addHeaders(headers: ?) Adds a map of headers to the runtime. void $browser.deleteHeader(header: string) Deletes a specific header from the runtime. void $browser.deleteHeaders(header: [string]) Deletes all headers in argument from runtime. void $browser.addHostnameToBlacklist(hostname: string) Disallows a hostname. Allows use wildcards. void $browser.addHostnamesToBlacklist(hostnameArr: [string]) Disallows all hostnames in an array of arguments. Allows use wildcards. void $browser.addHostnameToWhitelist(hostname: string) Allows a hostname blocked by default in synthetic monitoring. void $browser.addHostnamesToWhitelist(hostnameArr: [string]) Allows all hostnames in argument. void $browser.deleteHostnameFromBlacklist(hostname: string) Removes a hostname from this browser instance's blacklist. void $browser.deleteHostnamesFromBlacklist(hostnameArr: [string]) Removes all hostnames in argument from the disallowed list. void $browser.deleteHostnameFromWhitelist(hostnameArr: [string]) Removes a hostname from this browser instance's allowed list. void $browser.deleteHostnamesFromWhitelist(hostnameArr: [string]) Removes all hostnames in argument from this browser instance's allowed list. void $browser.executeAsyncScript(script: ?, var_args: ?) Schedules a command to execute asynchronous JavaScript in the context of the currently selected frame or window. promise $browser.executeScript(script: ?, var_args: ?) Schedules a command to execute JavaScript in the context of the currently selected frame or window. promise $browser.findElement(locator: $driver.Locator) Schedule a command to find an element on the page. If not found, New Relic returns an error. WebElement $browser.findElements(locator: $driver.Locator) Schedule a command to search for multiple elements on the page. promise $browser.waitForAndFindElement(locator: $driver.Locator [, timeout: number) Schedule a command to wait for and find an element on the page, and another command to wait for it to be visible. If not found, New Relic returns an error. The timeout value is an optional one, and gets applied separately to both tasks of finding the element and waiting for its visibility. This means at worst case, this method can take up to twice the provided timeout value. The default timeout value is 1000 ms (1 second). promise $browser.get(url: string) Loads a webpage in a synthetic browser. promise $browser.getAllWindowHandles() Schedules a command to retrieve the current list of available window handles. promise $browser.getCapabilities() A promise that will resolve with the instance's capabilities. promise $browser.getCurrentUrl() Schedules a command to retrieve the URL of the current page. promise $browser.getHeaders() Returns a map of currently configured headers. map $browser.getPageSource() Schedules a command to retrieve the current page's source. The page source returned is a representation of the underlying DOM; do not expect it to be formatted or escaped in the same way as the response sent from the web server. promise $browser.getSession() A promise for this client's session. promise $browser.getTitle() Schedules a command to retrieve the current page's title. promise $browser.getWindowHandle() Schedules a command to retrieve the current window handle. promise $browser.isElementPresent(locatorOrElement: $driver.Locator) Schedules a command to test if an element is present on the page. If given a DOM element, this function will check if it belongs to the document the driver is currently focused on. Otherwise, the function will test if at least one element can be found with the given search criteria. promise $browser.manage() The options interface for this instance. You can manage cookies, timeouts, and other window options. void $browser.navigate() The navigation interface (history of browser functions) for this instance. void $browser.schedule(command: ?, description: string) Schedules a command to be executed by this driver's CommandExecutor. promise $browser.sleep() Schedules a command to make the driver sleep for the given amount of time. promise $browser.switchTo() The target locator interface for this instance. void $browser.takeScreenshot() Schedule a command to take a screenshot. promise $browser.wait(fn: $driver.until.Condition, timeout: number, opt_message: string) Schedules a command to wait for a condition to hold, as defined by some user supplied function. webElement $browser.waitForPendingRequests(timeout: number) Causes the script to wait for requests that have been initiated to return, up to the timeout. Useful for tracking non-blocking resources. promise Disallow list: Wildcard use Disallowing domains for your browser instance requires wildcards to match the URL syntax of the URL to be blocked. An overall .com disallowed list needs to contain these functions: Function Blocking action $browser.addHostnameToBlacklist('*.com'); a.com $browser.addHostnameToBlacklist('*.*.com'); a.b.com $browser.addHostnameToBlacklist('*.*.*.com'); a.b.c.com $browser.addHostnameToBlacklist('www.*.com'); www.a.com $browser.addHostnameToBlacklist('www.*.*.com'); www.a.b.com $browser.addHostnameToBlacklist('www.*.*.*.com'); www.a.b.c.com Options: Manage the browser instance These functions manage options for your browser instance such as cookies, timeouts and window size. Access these options through the $browser.manage() function. Function Return value $browser.manage().addCookie(name: string, value: string, opt_path: string, opt_domain: string, opt_isSecure: boolean, opt_expiry: number) Schedules a command to add a cookie. promise $browser.manage().deleteAllCookies() Schedules a command to delete all cookies visible to the current page. promise $browser.manage().deleteCookie(name: string) Schedules a command to delete the cookie with the given name. This command is a no-op if there is no cookie with the given name visible to the current page. promise $browser.manage().getCookie(name: string) Schedules a command to retrieve the cookie with the given name. Returns null if there is no such cookie. The cookie will be returned as a JSON object as described by the WebDriver wire protocol. promise $browser.manage().getCookies() Schedules a command to retrieve all cookies visible to the current page. New Relic Syntheticcs returns each cookie as a JSON object as described by the WebDriver wire protocol. promise $browser.manage().timeouts().implicitlyWait(ms: number) Specifies the amount of time the driver should wait when searching for an element if it is not immediately present. Setting the wait timeout to 0 disables implicit waiting. Be careful increasing the wait timeout, as it will increase test run time, especially with slower location strategies like XPath. Default is 10 seconds. promise $browser.manage().timeouts().pageLoadTimeout(ms: number) Sets the amount of time to wait for a page load to complete before returning an error. If the timeout is negative, page loads may last up to 180 seconds. Default is 60 seconds. promise $browser.manage().timeouts().setScriptTimeout(ms: number) Sets the amount of time to wait, in milliseconds, for an asynchronous script to finish execution before returning an error. Default is 30 seconds. promise $browser.manage().window().getPosition() Retrieves the window's current position, relative to the top left corner of the screen. promise $browser.manage().window().getSize() Retrieves the window's current size. promise $browser.manage().window().maximize() Maximizes the current window. promise $browser.manage().window().setPosition(x: number, y: number) Repositions the current window. promise $browser.manage().window().setSize(width: number, height: number) Resizes the current window. promise Locators: Find page elements Locators are a collection of factory functions for creating locator instances. Locators find DOM elements, which can be passed to functions such as $browser.findElement or $browser.isElementPresent. Call them through $driver.By. Function Return value $driver.By.className(className: string) Locates an element that has a specific class name. The returned locator is equivalent to searching for elements with the CSS selector .clazz. locator $driver.By.css(cssName: string) Locates an element using a CSS selector. locator $driver.By.id(id: string) Locates an element by its ID. locator $driver.By.linkText(linkText: string) Locates link elements whose visible text matches the given string. locator $driver.By.js(js: string) Locates an element by evaluating a JavaScript expression. locator $driver.By.name(name: string) Locates elements whose name attribute has the given value. locator $driver.By.partialLinkText(partialLinkText: string) Locates link elements whose getText visible contains the given substring. locator $driver.By.tagName(tagName: string) Locates elements with a given tag name. The returned locator is equivalent to using the getElementsByTagName DOM function. locator $driver.By.xpath(xpath: string) Locates elements matching a XPath selector. locator WebElement: Interact with page elements When a function such as $browser.findElement or $browser.waitForAndFindElement returns a WebElement reference, these functions can be used to interact with that element. Using these, you can click on buttons, sent text to form inputs, and get attributes of elements to test. Function Return value click() Clicks on this element. void sendKeys(var_args: ?) Schedules a command to type a sequence on the DOM element represented by this instance. WebElement getTagName() Schedules a command to query for the tag/node name of this element. WebElement getCssValue(name: string) Schedules a command to query for the computed style of the element represented by this instance. If the element inherits the named style from its parent, the parent will be queried for its value. Where possible, color values will be converted to their hex representation (for example, #00ff00 instead of rgb(0, 255, 0)). promise getAttribute(name: string) Schedules a command to query for the value of the given attribute of the element. promise getText(name: string) Get the visible (not hidden by CSS) innerText of this element, including sub-elements, without any leading or trailing white space. promise getSize() Schedules a command to compute the size of this element's bounding box, in pixels. promise getLocation() Schedules a command to compute the location of this element, in page space. promise isEnabled() Schedules a command to query whether the DOM element represented by this instance is enabled, as dictated by the disabled attribute. promise isSelected() Schedules a command to query whether this element is selected. promise submit() Schedules a command to submit the form containing this element (or this element if it is a FORM element). This command is a no-op if the element is not contained in a form. promise clear() Schedules a command to clear the value of this element. promise isDisplayed() Schedules a command to test whether this element is currently displayed. promise getOuterHtml() Schedules a command to retrieve the outer HTML of this element. promise getInnerHtml() Schedules a command to retrieve the inner HTML of this element. promise ActionSequence: Link multiple actions Action sequences can create complex user interactions with your website. To create a new action sequence, use $browser.actions(). To link multiple actions together into a sequence, include perform() after each. This executes and then terminates individual sequences, including single-action sequences. The following table contains a list of available actions. For more information, see the WebDriver ActionSequence documentation. Function Return value click(opt_elementOrButton: ?, opt_button: ?) Clicks a mouse button. If an element is provided, the mouse will first be moved to the center of that element. This is equivalent to WebElement.click(). actionsequence doubleClick(opt_elementOrButton: ?, opt_button: ?) Double-clicks a mouse button. If an element is provided, the mouse will first be moved to the center of that element. actionsequence dragAndDrop(element: ?, location: ?) Convenience function for performing a \"drag and drop\" maneuver. The target element may be moved to the location of another element, or by an offset (in pixels). The location is an object with two properties x and y: {x: x_offset, y: y_offset}. actionsequence keyDown(key: ?) Performs a modifier key press. Must be one of ALT, CONTROL, SHIFT, COMMAND, or META. The modifier key is not released until keyUp() or sendKeys() is called. The key press will be targeted at the currently focused element. actionsequence keyUp(key: ?) Performs a modifier key release. The release is targeted at the currently focused element. actionsequence mouseDown(opt_elementOrButton: ?, opt_button: ?) Presses a mouse button. The mouse button will not be released until mouseUp is called, regardless of whether that call is made in this sequence or another. The behavior for out-of-order events (such as calling mouseDown() or click() when the button is already held down) is undefined. actionsequence mouseUp(opt_elementOrButton: ?, opt_button: ?) Releases a mouse button. Behavior is undefined for calling this function without a previous call to mouseDown(). actionsequence mouseMove(location: ?, offset: ?) Moves the mouse. The location to move to may be specified in terms of the mouse's current location, an offset relative to the top-left corner of an element, or an element (in which case the middle of the element is used). actionsequence perform() Executes this action sequence. promise sendKeys(args: ?) Simulates typing multiple keys. Each modifier key encountered in the sequence will not be released until it is encountered again. All key events will be targeted at the currently focused element. For a full list of supported non-alphanumeric keys, see the WebDriver enum key documentation. actionsequence Promises: Link actions into sequences You can also execute functions directly on promises. Synthetic monitoring is a native Node.js environment and uses standard Node.js promises. These functions evaluate the status of promises, cancel them, and more. In particular, you can create sequences of actions with the then() function and its siblings, thenFinally() and thenCatch(). For more information, see Sequence actions. Function Return value cancel(string: reason) Cancels the computation of this promise's value, rejecting the promise in the process. This method is a no-op if the promise has already been resolved. void isPending() Whether this promise's value is still being computed. boolean then(opt_callback: fn(T: ?), opt_errback: fn()) Registers listeners for when this instance is resolved. This is the basic function used to link synchronous actions in your script. promise thenFinally(callback: fn()) Registers a listener to invoke when this promise is resolved, regardless of whether the promise's value was successfully computed. promise thenCatch(callback: fn()) Registers a listener for when this promise is rejected. promise Navigate: Move through browser history The $browser.navigate() function exposes a number of functions that allow you to move backwards and forwards through your browser history, refresh your page and navigate to new pages. Function Return value back() Move back by one step in the browser's history. void forward() Move forward by one step in the browser's history. void refresh() Refresh the current page. void to(string: url) Load a new webpage in the current browser window. $browser.navigate().to() is equivalent to $browser.get(). void Conditions: Pause and wait for conditions Used with $browser.wait, until pauses your script execution until the condition is matched. For more information on explicit and implicit waits, see the WebDriver documentation. For .wait and .until usage examples, see Webdriver.wait examples. The following are available functions for $driver.until.Condition: Function Return value ableToSwitchToFrame(frame: ?) Creates a condition that will wait until the input driver is able to switch to the designated frame. The target frame may be specified as: A numeric index into window.frames for the current frame A webdriver.WebElement, which must reference a FRAME or IFRAME element on the current page A locator which may be used to first locate a FRAME or IFRAME on the current page before attempting to switch to it Upon successful resolution of this condition, the driver will be left focused on the new frame. condition alertIsPresent() Creates a condition that waits for an alert to be opened. Upon success, the returned promise will be fulfilled with the handle for the opened alert. condition elementIsDisabled(element: $driver.WebElement) Creates a condition that will wait for the given element to be disabled. condition elementIsEnabled(element: $driver.WebElement) Creates a condition that will wait for the given element to be enabled. condition elementIsNotVisible(element: $driver.WebElement) Creates a condition that will wait for the given element to be in the DOM, yet not visible to the user. condition elementIsVisible(element: $driver.WebElement) Creates a condition that will wait for the given element to become visible. condition elementIsSelected(element: $driver.WebElement) Creates a condition that will wait for the given element to be selected. condition elementLocated(element: $driver.Locator) Creates a condition that will loop until an element is found with the given locator. condition elementsLocated(element: $driver.Locator) Creates a condition that will loop until at least one element is found with the given locator. condition elementTextContains(element: $driver.WebElement, substr: string) Creates a condition that will wait for the given element's visible text to contain the given substring. condition elementTextIs(element: $driver.WebElement, text: string) Case sensitive. Creates a condition that will wait for the given element's visible text to match the given text exactly. condition elementTextMatches(element: $driver.WebElement, regex: string) Creates a condition that will wait for the given element's visible text to match a regular expression. condition stalenessOf(element: $driver.WebElement) Creates a condition that will wait for the given element to become stale. An element is considered stale once it is removed from the DOM, or a new page has loaded. condition titleContains(substr: string) Creates a condition that will wait for the current page's title to contain the given substring. condition titleIs(title: string) Creates a condition that will wait for the current page's title to match the given value. condition titleMatches(regex: string) Creates a condition that will wait for the current page's title to match the given regular expression. condition",

      "body": "Read on to learn about synthetic monitoring's proxy settings and properties. Proxy settings API for scripted monitors Important You can set proxy server configuration for synthetic scripted monitors for monitor versions 0.4.0 or higher. The global object $network allows you to control the network configuration used by your synthetic scripted monitors. The following are applicable for both scripted browsers and API tests, unless otherwise stated. $network.setProxy(string or object PROXY URL) Sets a proxy server to be used for all per-URL requests (HTTP, HTTPS, and FTP). Additional notes: The port is optional. If not provided, it will be derived from the scheme. For example, for HTTP the port would be 80. The username and password are assumed to be the result of a call to encodeURIComponent(). Special characters like @ and : in the username and/or the password must be escaped. Returns This method returns a Promise that will resolve once the configuration has been applied. Parameters Parameter Data Type Description proxyURL | proxyUrlParsed String or Object The URL to connect to the proxy server. A string containing a proxyURL (for example, http://proxy_host:8888) or a plain object in the same format as defined by Node's url.parse(urlString) method. Examples An example of setting a proxy server with HTTP protocol on port 1234 with no authentication: $network.setProxy('http://host.com:1234') Copy An example of setting a proxy server with HTTP protocol with authentication credentials. $network.setProxy('http://proxyUsername:proxyPassword@proxyHost:1234') Copy $network.setProxyForHttp(string or object PROXY URL) Tip This call is exactly the same as the per-URL setProxy call, except that it applies to HTTP traffic. Sets a proxy server to be used for all HTTP requests. Additional notes: The port is optional. If not provided, it will be derived from the scheme. For example, for HTTP the port would be 80. The username and password are assumed to be the result of a call to encodeURIComponent(). Special characters like @ and : in the username and/or the password must be escaped. Returns This method returns a Promise that will resolve once the configuration has been applied. Parameters Parameter Data Type Description proxyURL | proxyUrlParsed String or Object The URL to connect to the proxy server. A string containing a proxyURL (for example, http://proxy_host:8888) or a plain object in the same format as defined by Node's url.parse(urlString) method. Examples An example of setting a proxy server with HTTP protocol on port 1234 with no authentication: $network.setProxyForHttp('http://host.com:1234') Copy An example of setting a proxy server with HTTP protocol with authentication credentials. $network.setProxyForHttp('http://proxyUsername:proxyPassword@proxyHost:1234') Copy $network.setProxyForHttps(string or object PROXY URL) Tip This call is exactly the same as the per-URL setProxy call, except that it applies to HTTPS traffic. Sets a proxy server to be used for all HTTPS requests. Additional notes: The port is optional. If not provided, it will be derived from the scheme. For example, for HTTP the default port would be 443. The username and password are assumed to be the result of a call to encodeURIComponent(). Special characters like @ and : in the username and/or the password must be escaped. Returns This method returns a Promise that will resolve once the configuration has been applied. Parameters Parameter Data Type Description proxyURL | proxyUrlParsed String or Object The URL to connect to the proxy server. A string containing a proxyURL (for example, http://proxy_host:8888) or a plain object in the same format as defined by Node's url.parse(urlString) method. Examples An example of setting a proxy server with HTTPS protocol on port 1234 with no authentication: $network.setProxyForHttps('https://host.com:1234') Copy An example of setting a proxy server with HTTPS protocol with authentication credentials. $network.setProxyForHttps('https://proxyUsername:proxyPassword@proxyHost:1234') Copy $network.setProxyPAC(string PAC SCRIPT URL, object AUTH OBJECT) Sets a proxy server via a proxy auto-config (PAC) script and returns a promise. This function is only available for scripted browser monitors. Returns This method returns a Promise that will resolve once the configuration has been applied. Parameters Parameter Data Type Description scriptURL String The URL of the PAC script. authCredentialsMap Object Map of authentication credentials to be provided to the proxy server(s), keyed by the hostnames of the proxy server. Values of this map must be defined in the format {username: 'authUsername', password: 'authPassword'} Examples An example of setting a proxy server via a proxy auto-config (PAC) script: var authCredentialsMap = { 'example.com': {username: 'authUsername', password: 'authPassword'}, } Copy Here's an example of setting up a proxied network via proxy auto-config (PAC) script: var authCredentialsMap = { 'example.com': {username: 'authUsername', password: 'authPassword'}, 'anotherExample.com': {username: 'authUsername', password: 'authPassword'}, } $network.setProxyPAC(\"https://www.example.com/pacScript\", authCredentialsMap) Copy $network.setProxyAdvanced(object PROXY RULES OBJECT) Tip This method is Chrome-specific: it only applies to scripted browser monitor types. It can be used to allow for a more flexible and complex proxy configuration. In most cases, this method will not be needed. Sets the proxy configuration using the format supported by Chrome Extension API for Proxying. The input is a ProxyRules object, as defined by the Chrome Extension API to configures proxies. You can add authCredentials for proxies that need it. See Parameters for more details. Returns This method returns a Promise that will resolve once the configuration has been applied. Parameters Parameter Data Type Description ProxyRules Object Object The proxyRulesObject is a plain object that follows the format ProxyRules as defined by the Chrome Extension API to configures proxies. This object is \"flavoured\" to fit our runtime: users can define an additional property, authCredentials, for the Proxy server objects to provide authentication credentials for a specific proxy server. authCredentials is an object in the format {username: 'authUsername', password: 'authPassword'}. Examples Here's an example of creating a proxyRules with authCredentials: var proxyRules = { singleProxy: { host:\"example.com\", authCredentials: { username: 'authUsername', password: 'authPassword' } } }; Copy Here's an example of setting up a proxied network with mixed network zone assets: var proxyRules = {singleProxy: {host:\"http://entproxy.mycompany.com\"}, bypassList:['s3.amazonaws.com','*.localcdn.com'] } $network.setProxyAdvanced(proxyRules) Copy $network.clearProxy() Clears/removes the current proxy configuration. Returns This method returns a Promise that will resolve once the configuration has been applied. $network.getProxy() This method returns the current proxy configuration. It must be synchronized in a promise callback. Examples An example of synchronizing getProxy with $network.setProxy(); and $network.clearProxy();: var assert = require('assert'); $network.setProxy(\"http://user:password@myproxyurl.com\") .then(function () { console.log('Proxy configuration applied'); //Note: $network.getProxy() is not synchronized with the webdriver Control Flow. //To make sure we get the proxy configuration after the call to setProxy() above // succeeds we need to use a promise callback var proxyData = $network.getProxy(); console.log(proxyData); }) .then(function () { // Again: getProxy() is not synchronized with the Webdriver Control Flow: we //need this promise callback otherwise clearProxy() might be called before the call // to getProxy() above returns return $network.clearProxy(); }) .then(function () { console.log('Proxy configuration cleared'); // We need this promise callback for reasons explained above var proxyData = $network.getProxy(); assert.equal(proxyData.rules, null); }); Copy Proxy properties Important This proxy information applies only to these versions: API monitors: 0.4.0, 0.2.2, 0.2.1, 0.1.0 Scripted monitors: 0.1.0 In order to analyze and collect your HTTP traffic metrics, New Relic must ensure the traffic passes through a conceptual funnel. Our synthetic monitoring includes a software funnel component capable of analyzing the HTTP requests or responses and then recording the information. New Relic's scripted browser monitors (versions 0.4.x and lower) include a mechanism to do this analysis without needing an HTTP proxy, so you don't have to configure anything. New Relic's API test (versions 0.4.x and lower) provides an $http object that is pre-configured to make the requests pass through the internal HTTP proxy. This allows you to write your test without including any proxy settings. If you want to use some other way to generate HTTP traffic while still collecting the HTTP traffic metrics, you can use $env.PROXY_HOST and $env.PROXY_PORT. To record traffic metrics, be sure to include these properties in your script.",

Here's an example of optional metadata in the options object: Using optional metadata //Declare optional metadata var options = { //Specify the endpoint URL url: 'https://api-endpoint.example.com', //Specify optional headers headers: { 'Endpoint-Key': 'uqNTC57Phe72pnnB8JuJmwAr7b09nKSKSz', 'Additional-Header': 'Additional-Header-Data' } }; Copy For SSL and agentOptions: If you are setting SSL options or providing an agentOptions object, the agent property in the request options object will need to be set to $globalAgents.https or $globalAgents.http to ensure your HTTP requests use the instrumented global agent. Here's an example of using a SSL option or agentOptions: Using a SSL option or agentOptions This example uses agentOptions: //Declare optional metadata var options = { //Specify the endpoint URL url: 'https://api-endpoint.example.com', //Specify optional headers headers: { 'Endpoint-Key': 'uqNTC57Phe72pnnB8JuJmwAr7b09nKSKSz', 'Additional-Header': 'Additional-Header-Data' } //Specify global agent as the http agent agent: $globalAgents.https, //Set SSL option strictSSL: true, //Specify http agent options agentOptions: { ​maxVersion: 'TLSv1.1' }, }; Copy Send a GET request To make a GET request, use the $http.get method to submit your request. Define your request options, make your request using $http.get, then validate the response to ensure your endpoint is returning the correct results. Insights GET example This example queries the Insights API by using GET: //Define your authentication credentials var myAccountID = '{YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID}'; var myQueryKey = '{YOUR_QUERY_KEY}'; var options = { //Define endpoint URI uri: 'https://insights-api.newrelic.com/v1/accounts/'+myAccountID+'/query?nrql=SELECT%20average(duration)%20FROM%20Transaction', //Define query key and expected data type. headers: { 'X-Query-Key': myQueryKey, 'Accept': 'application/json' } }; //Define expected results using callback function. function callback (err, response, body){ //Log JSON results from endpoint to Synthetics console. console.log(JSON.parse(body)); console.log('done with script'); } //Make GET request, passing in options and callback. $http.get(options,callback); Copy Send a POST request To make a POST request, use the $http.post method to submit your request. Define your request options, make your request using $http.post, then validate the response to ensure your endpoint is returning the correct results. Custom event POST example This example POSTs a custom event containing static integers to the Event API: //Define your authentication credentials. var myAccountID = '{YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID}'; var myLicenseKey = '{YOUR_LICENSE_KEY}'; //Import the 'assert' module to validate results. var assert = require('assert'); var options = { //Define endpoint URL. url: \"https://insights-collector.newrelic.com/v1/accounts/\"+myAccountID+\"/events\", //Define body of POST request. body: '[{\"eventType\":\"SyntheticsEvent\",\"integer1\":1000,\"integer2\":2000}]', //Define New Relic license key and expected data type. headers: { 'Api-Key': myLicenseKey, 'Content-Type': 'application/json' } }; //Define expected results using callback function. function callback(error, response, body) { //Log status code to Synthetics console. console.log(response.statusCode + \" status code\") //Verify endpoint returns 200 (OK) response code. assert.ok(response.statusCode == 200, 'Expected 200 OK response'); //Parse JSON received from Insights into variable. var info = JSON.parse(body); //Verify that `info` contains element named `success` with a value of `true`. assert.ok(info.success == true, 'Expected True results in Response Body, result was ' + info.success); //Log end of script. console.log(\"End reached\"); } //Make POST request, passing in options and callback. $http.post(options, callback); Copy Validate results To validate your results, import the assert module to define your test case. Call an assert method to validate your endpoint's response. If any assert functions fail, the entire monitor will be considered a failed check. This may trigger alert notifications and affect your metrics. Important Synthetic monitoring does not allow thrown exceptions. Thrown exceptions result in script failure. Use the assert module to validate your results, and use console.log() to log results to the synthetic's console. Event API validation example This example POSTs to the Event API, then validates that the response is {\"success\":true}: //Define your authentication credentials. var myAccountID = '{YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID}'; var myLicenseKey = '{YOUR_LICENSE_KEY}'; //Import the `assert` module to validate results. var assert = require('assert'); var options = { //Define endpoint URL. url: \"https://insights-collector.newrelic.com/v1/accounts/\"+myAccountID+\"/events\", //Define body of POST request. body: '[{\"eventType\":\"SyntheticsEvent\",\"integer1\":1000,\"integer2\":2000}]', //Define New Relic license key and expected data type. headers: { 'Api-Key': myLicenseKey, 'Content-Type': 'application/json' } }; $http.post(options, function(error, response, body) { //Log status code to Synthetics console. The status code is logged before the `assert` function, //because a failed assert function ends the script. console.log(response.statusCode + \" status code\") //Call `assert` method, expecting a `200` response code. //If assertion fails, log `Expected 200 OK response` as error message to Synthetics console. assert.ok(response.statusCode == 200, 'Expected 200 OK response'); var info = JSON.parse(body); //Call `assert` method, expecting body to return `{\"success\":true}`. //If assertion fails, log `Expected True results in Response Body,` plus results as error message to Synthetics console. assert.ok(info.success == true, 'Expected True results in Response Body, result was ' + info.success); }); Copy",

      "body": "This document is for synthetic monitor versions 0.4.x or lower. See also the documentation for Synthetic monitor versions 0.5 or higher. Overview Synthetic scripted browsers provide you access to the Selenium Webdriver APIs 2.47.0 via the variables $driver and $browser. In particular: $driver provides all the exports from the selenium-webdriver module (for example, ActionSequence, Button, By, WebElement, etc.). $browser is a synthetic-flavored instance of selenium-webdriver.WebDriver(): it exposes the main basic WebDriver APIs like get() and findElement(), as well as some synthetic custom APIs. This document describes the functions available for synthetic scripted browser monitors version 0.4.0 or lower. For the newest monitor documentation, see monitor version 0.5.0+ documentation. Other relevant documentation: For more on synthetic scripting, see Write scripted browsers. For example scripts, see Scripted browser examples. For more information about monitor versions and runtime differences, see Runtime environments. To view and share scripted browser examples, check out topics tagged synthetic-script in New Relic's Explorers Hub. Top-level functions: Build your script New Relic calls top-level functions directly from your $browser instance. These provide a wide range of functionality that covers many basic scriptable actions. Function Return value $browser.actions() Creates a new action sequence using this driver. For a list of available actions, see ActionSequence: Link multiple actions. void $browser.addHeader(headerKey: string, headerValue: string) Adds header headerKey with value headerValue to the runtime. void $browser.addHeaders(headers: ?) Adds a map of headers to the runtime. void $browser.deleteHeader(header: string) Deletes a specific header from the runtime. void $browser.deleteHeaders(header: [string]) Deletes all headers in argument from runtime. void $browser.addHostnameToBlacklist(hostname: string) Disallows a hostname. Allows use wildcards. void $browser.addHostnamesToBlacklist(hostnameArr: [string]) Disallows all hostnames in an array of arguments. Allows use wildcards. void $browser.addHostnameToWhitelist(hostname: string) Allows a hostname blocked by default in synthetic monitoring. void $browser.addHostnamesToWhitelist(hostnameArr: [string]) Allows all hostnames in argument. void $browser.deleteHostnameFromBlacklist(hostname: string) Removes a hostname from this browser instance's blacklist. void $browser.deleteHostnamesFromBlacklist(hostnameArr: [string]) Removes all hostnames in argument from the disallowed list. void $browser.deleteHostnameFromWhitelist(hostnameArr: [string]) Removes a hostname from this browser instance's allowed list. void $browser.deleteHostnamesFromWhitelist(hostnameArr: [string]) Removes all hostnames in argument from this browser instance's allowed list. void $browser.executeAsyncScript(script: ?, var_args: ?) Schedules a command to execute asynchronous JavaScript in the context of the currently selected frame or window. promise $browser.executeScript(script: ?, var_args: ?) Schedules a command to execute JavaScript in the context of the currently selected frame or window. promise $browser.findElement(locator: $driver.Locator) Schedule a command to find an element on the page. If not found, New Relic returns an error. WebElement $browser.findElements(locator: $driver.Locator) Schedule a command to search for multiple elements on the page. promise $browser.waitForAndFindElement(locator: $driver.Locator [, timeout: number) Schedule a command to wait for and find an element on the page, and another command to wait for it to be visible. If not found, New Relic returns an error. The timeout value is an optional one, and gets applied separately to both tasks of finding the element and waiting for its visibility. This means at worst case, this method can take up to twice the provided timeout value. The default timeout value is 1000 ms (1 second). promise $browser.get(url: string) Loads a webpage in a synthetic browser. promise $browser.getAllWindowHandles() Schedules a command to retrieve the current list of available window handles. promise $browser.getCapabilities() A promise that will resolve with the instance's capabilities. promise $browser.getCurrentUrl() Schedules a command to retrieve the URL of the current page. promise $browser.getHeaders() Returns a map of currently configured headers. map $browser.getPageSource() Schedules a command to retrieve the current page's source. The page source returned is a representation of the underlying DOM; do not expect it to be formatted or escaped in the same way as the response sent from the web server. promise $browser.getSession() A promise for this client's session. promise $browser.getTitle() Schedules a command to retrieve the current page's title. promise $browser.getWindowHandle() Schedules a command to retrieve the current window handle. promise $browser.isElementPresent(locatorOrElement: $driver.Locator) Schedules a command to test if an element is present on the page. If given a DOM element, this function will check if it belongs to the document the driver is currently focused on. Otherwise, the function will test if at least one element can be found with the given search criteria. promise $browser.manage() The options interface for this instance. You can manage cookies, timeouts, and other window options. void $browser.navigate() The navigation interface (history of browser functions) for this instance. void $browser.schedule(command: ?, description: string) Schedules a command to be executed by this driver's CommandExecutor. promise $browser.sleep() Schedules a command to make the driver sleep for the given amount of time. promise $browser.switchTo() The target locator interface for this instance. void $browser.takeScreenshot() Schedule a command to take a screenshot. promise $browser.wait(fn: $driver.until.Condition, timeout: number, opt_message: string) Schedules a command to wait for a condition to hold, as defined by some user supplied function. webElement $browser.waitForPendingRequests(timeout: number) Causes the script to wait for requests that have been initiated to return, up to the timeout. Useful for tracking non-blocking resources. promise Disallow list: Wildcard use Disallowing domains for your browser instance requires wildcards to match the URL syntax of the URL to be blocked. An overall .com disallowed list needs to contain these functions: Function Blocking action $browser.addHostnameToBlacklist('*.com'); a.com $browser.addHostnameToBlacklist('*.*.com'); a.b.com $browser.addHostnameToBlacklist('*.*.*.com'); a.b.c.com $browser.addHostnameToBlacklist('www.*.com'); www.a.com $browser.addHostnameToBlacklist('www.*.*.com'); www.a.b.com $browser.addHostnameToBlacklist('www.*.*.*.com'); www.a.b.c.com Options: Manage the browser instance These functions manage options for your browser instance such as cookies, timeouts and window size. Access these options through the $browser.manage() function. Function Return value $browser.manage().addCookie(name: string, value: string, opt_path: string, opt_domain: string, opt_isSecure: boolean, opt_expiry: number) Schedules a command to add a cookie. promise $browser.manage().deleteAllCookies() Schedules a command to delete all cookies visible to the current page. promise $browser.manage().deleteCookie(name: string) Schedules a command to delete the cookie with the given name. This command is a no-op if there is no cookie with the given name visible to the current page. promise $browser.manage().getCookie(name: string) Schedules a command to retrieve the cookie with the given name. Returns null if there is no such cookie. The cookie will be returned as a JSON object as described by the WebDriver wire protocol. promise $browser.manage().getCookies() Schedules a command to retrieve all cookies visible to the current page. New Relic Syntheticcs returns each cookie as a JSON object as described by the WebDriver wire protocol. promise $browser.manage().timeouts().implicitlyWait(ms: number) Specifies the amount of time the driver should wait when searching for an element if it is not immediately present. Setting the wait timeout to 0 disables implicit waiting. Be careful increasing the wait timeout, as it will increase test run time, especially with slower location strategies like XPath. Default is 10 seconds. promise $browser.manage().timeouts().pageLoadTimeout(ms: number) Sets the amount of time to wait for a page load to complete before returning an error. If the timeout is negative, page loads may last up to 180 seconds. Default is 60 seconds. promise $browser.manage().timeouts().setScriptTimeout(ms: number) Sets the amount of time to wait, in milliseconds, for an asynchronous script to finish execution before returning an error. Default is 30 seconds. promise $browser.manage().window().getPosition() Retrieves the window's current position, relative to the top left corner of the screen. promise $browser.manage().window().getSize() Retrieves the window's current size. promise $browser.manage().window().maximize() Maximizes the current window. promise $browser.manage().window().setPosition(x: number, y: number) Repositions the current window. promise $browser.manage().window().setSize(width: number, height: number) Resizes the current window. promise Locators: Find page elements Locators are a collection of factory functions for creating locator instances. Locators find DOM elements, which can be passed to functions such as $browser.findElement or $browser.isElementPresent. Call them through $driver.By. Function Return value $driver.By.className(className: string) Locates an element that has a specific class name. The returned locator is equivalent to searching for elements with the CSS selector .clazz. locator $driver.By.css(cssName: string) Locates an element using a CSS selector. locator $driver.By.id(id: string) Locates an element by its ID. locator $driver.By.linkText(linkText: string) Locates link elements whose visible text matches the given string. locator $driver.By.js(js: string) Locates an element by evaluating a JavaScript expression. locator $driver.By.name(name: string) Locates elements whose name attribute has the given value. locator $driver.By.partialLinkText(partialLinkText: string) Locates link elements whose getText visible contains the given substring. locator $driver.By.tagName(tagName: string) Locates elements with a given tag name. The returned locator is equivalent to using the getElementsByTagName DOM function. locator $driver.By.xpath(xpath: string) Locates elements matching a XPath selector. locator WebElement: Interact with page elements When a function such as $browser.findElement or $browser.waitForAndFindElement returns a WebElement reference, these functions can be used to interact with that element. Using these, you can click on buttons, sent text to form inputs, and get attributes of elements to test. Function Return value click() Clicks on this element. void sendKeys(var_args: ?) Schedules a command to type a sequence on the DOM element represented by this instance. WebElement getTagName() Schedules a command to query for the tag/node name of this element. WebElement getCssValue(name: string) Schedules a command to query for the computed style of the element represented by this instance. If the element inherits the named style from its parent, the parent will be queried for its value. Where possible, color values will be converted to their hex representation (for example, #00ff00 instead of rgb(0, 255, 0)). promise getAttribute(name: string) Schedules a command to query for the value of the given attribute of the element. promise getText(name: string) Get the visible (not hidden by CSS) innerText of this element, including sub-elements, without any leading or trailing white space. promise getSize() Schedules a command to compute the size of this element's bounding box, in pixels. promise getLocation() Schedules a command to compute the location of this element, in page space. promise isEnabled() Schedules a command to query whether the DOM element represented by this instance is enabled, as dictated by the disabled attribute. promise isSelected() Schedules a command to query whether this element is selected. promise submit() Schedules a command to submit the form containing this element (or this element if it is a FORM element). This command is a no-op if the element is not contained in a form. promise clear() Schedules a command to clear the value of this element. promise isDisplayed() Schedules a command to test whether this element is currently displayed. promise getOuterHtml() Schedules a command to retrieve the outer HTML of this element. promise getInnerHtml() Schedules a command to retrieve the inner HTML of this element. promise ActionSequence: Link multiple actions Action sequences can create complex user interactions with your website. To create a new action sequence, use $browser.actions(). To link multiple actions together into a sequence, include perform() after each. This executes and then terminates individual sequences, including single-action sequences. The following table contains a list of available actions. For more information, see the WebDriver ActionSequence documentation. Function Return value click(opt_elementOrButton: ?, opt_button: ?) Clicks a mouse button. If an element is provided, the mouse will first be moved to the center of that element. This is equivalent to WebElement.click(). actionsequence doubleClick(opt_elementOrButton: ?, opt_button: ?) Double-clicks a mouse button. If an element is provided, the mouse will first be moved to the center of that element. actionsequence dragAndDrop(element: ?, location: ?) Convenience function for performing a \"drag and drop\" maneuver. The target element may be moved to the location of another element, or by an offset (in pixels). The location is an object with two properties x and y: {x: x_offset, y: y_offset}. actionsequence keyDown(key: ?) Performs a modifier key press. Must be one of ALT, CONTROL, SHIFT, COMMAND, or META. The modifier key is not released until keyUp() or sendKeys() is called. The key press will be targeted at the currently focused element. actionsequence keyUp(key: ?) Performs a modifier key release. The release is targeted at the currently focused element. actionsequence mouseDown(opt_elementOrButton: ?, opt_button: ?) Presses a mouse button. The mouse button will not be released until mouseUp is called, regardless of whether that call is made in this sequence or another. The behavior for out-of-order events (such as calling mouseDown() or click() when the button is already held down) is undefined. actionsequence mouseUp(opt_elementOrButton: ?, opt_button: ?) Releases a mouse button. Behavior is undefined for calling this function without a previous call to mouseDown(). actionsequence mouseMove(location: ?, offset: ?) Moves the mouse. The location to move to may be specified in terms of the mouse's current location, an offset relative to the top-left corner of an element, or an element (in which case the middle of the element is used). actionsequence perform() Executes this action sequence. promise sendKeys(args: ?) Simulates typing multiple keys. Each modifier key encountered in the sequence will not be released until it is encountered again. All key events will be targeted at the currently focused element. For a full list of supported non-alphanumeric keys, see the WebDriver enum key documentation. actionsequence Promises: Link actions into sequences You can also execute functions directly on promises. Synthetic monitoring is a native Node.js environment and uses standard Node.js promises. These functions evaluate the status of promises, cancel them, and more. In particular, you can create sequences of actions with the then() function and its siblings, thenFinally() and thenCatch(). For more information, see Sequence actions. Function Return value cancel(string: reason) Cancels the computation of this promise's value, rejecting the promise in the process. This method is a no-op if the promise has already been resolved. void isPending() Whether this promise's value is still being computed. boolean then(opt_callback: fn(T: ?), opt_errback: fn()) Registers listeners for when this instance is resolved. This is the basic function used to link synchronous actions in your script. promise thenFinally(callback: fn()) Registers a listener to invoke when this promise is resolved, regardless of whether the promise's value was successfully computed. promise thenCatch(callback: fn()) Registers a listener for when this promise is rejected. promise Navigate: Move through browser history The $browser.navigate() function exposes a number of functions that allow you to move backwards and forwards through your browser history, refresh your page and navigate to new pages. Function Return value back() Move back by one step in the browser's history. void forward() Move forward by one step in the browser's history. void refresh() Refresh the current page. void to(string: url) Load a new webpage in the current browser window. $browser.navigate().to() is equivalent to $browser.get(). void Conditions: Pause and wait for conditions Used with $browser.wait, until pauses your script execution until the condition is matched. For more information on explicit and implicit waits, see the WebDriver documentation. For .wait and .until usage examples, see Webdriver.wait examples. The following are available functions for $driver.until.Condition: Function Return value ableToSwitchToFrame(frame: ?) Creates a condition that will wait until the input driver is able to switch to the designated frame. The target frame may be specified as: A numeric index into window.frames for the current frame A webdriver.WebElement, which must reference a FRAME or IFRAME element on the current page A locator which may be used to first locate a FRAME or IFRAME on the current page before attempting to switch to it Upon successful resolution of this condition, the driver will be left focused on the new frame. condition alertIsPresent() Creates a condition that waits for an alert to be opened. Upon success, the returned promise will be fulfilled with the handle for the opened alert. condition elementIsDisabled(element: $driver.WebElement) Creates a condition that will wait for the given element to be disabled. condition elementIsEnabled(element: $driver.WebElement) Creates a condition that will wait for the given element to be enabled. condition elementIsNotVisible(element: $driver.WebElement) Creates a condition that will wait for the given element to be in the DOM, yet not visible to the user. condition elementIsVisible(element: $driver.WebElement) Creates a condition that will wait for the given element to become visible. condition elementIsSelected(element: $driver.WebElement) Creates a condition that will wait for the given element to be selected. condition elementLocated(element: $driver.Locator) Creates a condition that will loop until an element is found with the given locator. condition elementsLocated(element: $driver.Locator) Creates a condition that will loop until at least one element is found with the given locator. condition elementTextContains(element: $driver.WebElement, substr: string) Creates a condition that will wait for the given element's visible text to contain the given substring. condition elementTextIs(element: $driver.WebElement, text: string) Case sensitive. Creates a condition that will wait for the given element's visible text to match the given text exactly. condition elementTextMatches(element: $driver.WebElement, regex: string) Creates a condition that will wait for the given element's visible text to match a regular expression. condition stalenessOf(element: $driver.WebElement) Creates a condition that will wait for the given element to become stale. An element is considered stale once it is removed from the DOM, or a new page has loaded. condition titleContains(substr: string) Creates a condition that will wait for the current page's title to contain the given substring. condition titleIs(title: string) Creates a condition that will wait for the current page's title to match the given value. condition titleMatches(regex: string) Creates a condition that will wait for the current page's title to match the given regular expression. condition",

      "body": "Use synthetic monitoring's API tests to monitor your API endpoint to ensure it is functioning correctly. New Relic uses the http-request module internally to make HTTP calls to your endpoint and validate the results. Here we present some example functions showing how to use the $http object to submit your request. For detailed documentation on the options available for this object, see the http-request readme. (Note that Request is deprecated, but these options still apply.) Tip To view and share other API test examples, visit the synthetics scripts section in Explorers Hub. Use API http-request module API tests are powered by the http-request module, which is available through the $http object. Once each frequency interval, New Relic queries your endpoint from each of your selected locations. For instructions on creating a monitor, see Adding monitors. Read on to learn how to define metadata for your request, make a GET request, make a POST request, and how to validate the results. Important After a maximum run time of three minutes, New Relic manually stops the script. one.newrelic.com > Synthetics > Create monitor: The script editor suggests functions, selectors, and other elements to simplify scripting commands (available in GitHub). Configure request options To start your script: Declare a variable (such as options) to store your request options object. Define request options such as the URL endpoint, and custom headers. If you're setting SSL or agent options, see SSL and agentOptions requirements. We recommend using SSL to avoid exposing plain text credentials in your headers. Tip For a full list of supported request options, see request(options, callback) in the http-request documentation on GitHub. Here's an example of optional metadata in the options object: Using optional metadata //Declare optional metadata var options = { //Specify the endpoint URL url: 'https://api-endpoint.example.com', //Specify optional headers headers: { 'Endpoint-Key': 'uqNTC57Phe72pnnB8JuJmwAr7b09nKSKSz', 'Additional-Header': 'Additional-Header-Data' } }; Copy For SSL and agentOptions: If you are setting SSL options or providing an agentOptions object, the agent property in the request options object will need to be set to $globalAgents.https or $globalAgents.http to ensure your HTTP requests use the instrumented global agent. Here's an example of using a SSL option or agentOptions: Using a SSL option or agentOptions This example uses agentOptions: //Declare optional metadata var options = { //Specify the endpoint URL url: 'https://api-endpoint.example.com', //Specify optional headers headers: { 'Endpoint-Key': 'uqNTC57Phe72pnnB8JuJmwAr7b09nKSKSz', 'Additional-Header': 'Additional-Header-Data' } //Specify global agent as the http agent agent: $globalAgents.https, //Set SSL option strictSSL: true, //Specify http agent options agentOptions: { ​maxVersion: 'TLSv1.1' }, }; Copy Send a GET request To make a GET request, use the $http.get method to submit your request. Define your request options, make your request using $http.get, then validate the response to ensure your endpoint is returning the correct results. Insights GET example This example queries the Insights API by using GET: //Define your authentication credentials var myAccountID = '{YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID}'; var myQueryKey = '{YOUR_QUERY_KEY}'; var options = { //Define endpoint URI uri: 'https://insights-api.newrelic.com/v1/accounts/'+myAccountID+'/query?nrql=SELECT%20average(duration)%20FROM%20Transaction', //Define query key and expected data type. headers: { 'X-Query-Key': myQueryKey, 'Accept': 'application/json' } }; //Define expected results using callback function. function callback (err, response, body){ //Log JSON results from endpoint to Synthetics console. console.log(JSON.parse(body)); console.log('done with script'); } //Make GET request, passing in options and callback. $http.get(options,callback); Copy Send a POST request To make a POST request, use the $http.post method to submit your request. Define your request options, make your request using $http.post, then validate the response to ensure your endpoint is returning the correct results. Custom event POST example This example POSTs a custom event containing static integers to the Event API: //Define your authentication credentials. var myAccountID = '{YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID}'; var myLicenseKey = '{YOUR_LICENSE_KEY}'; //Import the 'assert' module to validate results. var assert = require('assert'); var options = { //Define endpoint URL. url: \"https://insights-collector.newrelic.com/v1/accounts/\"+myAccountID+\"/events\", //Define body of POST request. body: '[{\"eventType\":\"SyntheticsEvent\",\"integer1\":1000,\"integer2\":2000}]', //Define New Relic license key and expected data type. headers: { 'Api-Key': myLicenseKey, 'Content-Type': 'application/json' } }; //Define expected results using callback function. function callback(error, response, body) { //Log status code to Synthetics console. console.log(response.statusCode + \" status code\") //Verify endpoint returns 200 (OK) response code. assert.ok(response.statusCode == 200, 'Expected 200 OK response'); //Parse JSON received from Insights into variable. var info = JSON.parse(body); //Verify that `info` contains element named `success` with a value of `true`. assert.ok(info.success == true, 'Expected True results in Response Body, result was ' + info.success); //Log end of script. console.log(\"End reached\"); } //Make POST request, passing in options and callback. $http.post(options, callback); Copy Validate results To validate your results, import the assert module to define your test case. Call an assert method to validate your endpoint's response. If any assert functions fail, the entire monitor will be considered a failed check. This may trigger alert notifications and affect your metrics. Important Synthetic monitoring does not allow thrown exceptions. Thrown exceptions result in script failure. Use the assert module to validate your results, and use console.log() to log results to the synthetic's console. Event API validation example This example POSTs to the Event API, then validates that the response is {\"success\":true}: //Define your authentication credentials. var myAccountID = '{YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID}'; var myLicenseKey = '{YOUR_LICENSE_KEY}'; //Import the `assert` module to validate results. var assert = require('assert'); var options = { //Define endpoint URL. url: \"https://insights-collector.newrelic.com/v1/accounts/\"+myAccountID+\"/events\", //Define body of POST request. body: '[{\"eventType\":\"SyntheticsEvent\",\"integer1\":1000,\"integer2\":2000}]', //Define New Relic license key and expected data type. headers: { 'Api-Key': myLicenseKey, 'Content-Type': 'application/json' } }; $http.post(options, function(error, response, body) { //Log status code to Synthetics console. The status code is logged before the `assert` function, //because a failed assert function ends the script. console.log(response.statusCode + \" status code\") //Call `assert` method, expecting a `200` response code. //If assertion fails, log `Expected 200 OK response` as error message to Synthetics console. assert.ok(response.statusCode == 200, 'Expected 200 OK response'); var info = JSON.parse(body); //Call `assert` method, expecting body to return `{\"success\":true}`. //If assertion fails, log `Expected True results in Response Body,` plus results as error message to Synthetics console. assert.ok(info.success == true, 'Expected True results in Response Body, result was ' + info.success); }); Copy",

      "body": "This document describes scripted browser functions available for synthetic monitors versions 0.5.x or higher. If you are using older monitor versions, see the monitor version 0.4.0 and lower documentation. For more on monitor versions and runtime differences, see Runtime environments. Selenium Webdriver APIs The synthetic scripted browsers provide access to the Selenium Webdriver APIs 3.6.0 for monitor version 0.6.x and Selenium Webdriver APIs 3.5.0 for monitor version 0.5.x via the variables $driver and $browser. In particular: $driver provides all the exports from the selenium-webdriver module (for example, ActionSequence, Button, By, WebElement, etc.). $browser is a synthetic monitoring instance of selenium-webdriver.WebDriver(). It exposes the main basic WebDriver APIs like get() and findElement(), as well as some synthetic custom APIs. Top-level functions: Build your script New Relic calls top-level functions directly from your $browser instance. These provide a wide range of functionality that covers many basic scriptable actions. Function Description $browser.actions() Creates a new action sequence using this driver. For a list of available actions, see ActionSequence. Return value: void $browser.addHeader(headerKey: string, headerValue: string) Adds header headerKey with value headerValue to the runtime. Return value: void $browser.addHeaders(headers: ?) Adds a map of headers to the runtime. Return value: void $browser.deleteHeader(header: string) Deletes a specific header from the runtime. Return value: void $browser.deleteHeaders(header: [string]) Deletes all headers in the argument from runtime. Return value: void $browser.addHostnameToBlacklist(hostname: string) Adds a hostname to your deny list. Allows using wildcards. Return value: void $browser.addHostnamesToBlacklist(hostnameArr: [string]) Adds all hostnames in an array of arguments to your deny list. Allows using wildcards. Return value: void $browser.addHostnameToWhitelist(hostname: string) Adds a hostname blocked by default in synthetic monitoring to your allow list. Return value: void $browser.addHostnamesToWhitelist(hostnameArr: [string]) Adds all hostnames in the argument to your allow list. Return value: void $browser.deleteHostnameFromBlacklist(hostname: string) Removes a hostname for this browser instance from your deny list. Return value: void $browser.deleteHostnamesFromBlacklist(hostnameArr: [string]) Removes all hostnames in the argument from your deny list. Return value: void $browser.deleteHostnameFromWhitelist(hostnameArr: [string]) Removes a hostname for this browser instance from your allow list. Return value: void $browser.deleteHostnamesFromWhitelist(hostnameArr: [string]) Removes all hostnames in the argument from your allow list for this browser instance. Return value: void $browser.executeAsyncScript(script: ?, var_args: ?) Schedules a command to execute asynchronous JavaScript in the context of the currently selected frame or window. Return value: promise $browser.executeScript(script: ?, var_args: ?) Schedules a command to execute JavaScript in the context of the currently selected frame or window. Return value: promise $browser.findElement(locator: $driver.Locator) Schedule a command to find an element on the page. If not found, synthetic monitoring returns an error. Return value: WebElementPromise $browser.findElements(locator: $driver.Locator) Schedule a command to search for multiple elements on the page. Return value: promise $browser.waitForAndFindElement(locator: $driver.Locator [, timeout: number) Schedule a command to wait for and find an element on the page, and another command to wait for it to be visible. If not found, synthetic monitoring returns an error. The timeout value is optional. It is applied separately to both tasks of finding the element and waiting for its visibility. This means at worst case, this method can take up to twice the provided timeout value. The default timeout value is 1000 ms (1 second). Return value: WebElementPromise $browser.get(url: string) Loads a webpage in a synthetic browser. Return value: promise $browser.getAllWindowHandles() Schedules a command to retrieve the current list of available window handles. Return value: promise $browser.getCapabilities() A promise that will resolve with the instance's capabilities. Return value: promise $browser.getCurrentUrl() Schedules a command to retrieve the URL of the current page. Return value: promise $browser.getHeaders() Returns a map of currently configured headers. Return value: map $browser.getPageSource() Schedules a command to retrieve the current page's source. The page source returned is a representation of the underlying DOM. Do not expect it to be formatted or escaped in the same way as the response sent from the web server. Return value: promise $browser.getSession() A promise for this client's session. Return value: promise $browser.getTitle() Schedules a command to retrieve the current page's title. Return value: promise $browser.getWindowHandle() Schedules a command to retrieve the current window handle. Return value: promise $browser.manage() The options interface for this instance. You can manage cookies, timeouts, and other window options. Return value: void $browser.navigate() The navigation interface (history of browser functions) for this instance. Return value: void $browser.schedule(command: ?, description: string) Schedules a command to be executed by this driver's CommandExecutor. Return value: promise $browser.sleep() Schedules a command to make the driver sleep for the given amount of time.

Return value: promise $browser.wait(fn: $driver.Condition, timeout: number, opt_message: string) Schedules a command to wait for a condition to hold, as defined by your supplied function. Return value: WebElement $browser.waitForPendingRequests(timeout: number) Causes the script to wait for requests that have been initiated to return, up to the timeout. Useful for tracking non-blocking resources. Return value: promise Deny list: Wildcard use If you want to add domains to the deny list for your browser instance, the wildcards must match the URL syntax of the URL to be blocked. An overall .com deny list must contain these functions: Function Blocking action $browser.addHostnameToBlacklist('*.com'); a.com $browser.addHostnameToBlacklist('*.*.com'); a.b.com $browser.addHostnameToBlacklist('*.*.*.com'); a.b.c.com $browser.addHostnameToBlacklist('www.*.com'); www.a.com $browser.addHostnameToBlacklist('www.*.*.com'); www.a.b.com $browser.addHostnameToBlacklist('www.*.*.*.com'); www.a.b.c.com Options: Manage the browser instance These functions manage options for your browser instance, such as cookies, timeouts, and window size. Access these options through the $browser.manage() function. Function Description $browser.manage().addCookie(spec: object) Schedules a command to add a cookie. spec is a record object describing a browser cookie. For more information, see the Selenium documentation. Return value: promise $browser.manage().deleteAllCookies() Schedules a command to delete all cookies visible to the current page. Return value: promise $browser.manage().deleteCookie(name: string) Schedules a command to delete the cookie with the given name. This command is a no-op if there is no cookie with the given name visible to the current page. Return value: promise $browser.manage().getCookie(name: string) Schedules a command to retrieve the cookie with the given name. Returns null if there is no such cookie. The cookie will be returned as a JSON object as described by the WebDriver wire protocol. Return value: promise $browser.manage().getCookies() Schedules a command to retrieve all cookies visible to the current page. New Relic Syntheticcs returns each cookie as a JSON object as described by the WebDriver wire protocol. Return value: promise $browser.manage().timeouts().implicitlyWait(ms: number) Specifies the amount of time the driver should wait when searching for an element if it is not immediately present. Setting the wait timeout to 0 disables implicit waiting. Be careful increasing the wait timeout, as it will increase test run time, especially with slower location strategies like XPath. Default is 10 seconds. Return value: promise $browser.manage().timeouts().pageLoadTimeout(ms: number) Sets the amount of time to wait for a page load to complete before returning an error. If the timeout is negative, page loads may last up to 180 seconds. Default is 60 seconds. Return value: promise $browser.manage().timeouts().setScriptTimeout(ms: number) Sets the amount of time to wait, in milliseconds, for an asynchronous script to finish execution before returning an error. Default is 30 seconds. Return value: promise $browser.manage().window().getPosition() Retrieves the window's current position, relative to the top left corner of the screen. Return value: promise $browser.manage().window().getSize() Retrieves the window's current size. Return value: promise $browser.manage().window().maximize() Maximizes the current window. Return value: promise $browser.manage().window().setPosition(x: number, y: number) Repositions the current window. Return value: promise $browser.manage().window().setSize(width: number, height: number) Resizes the current window. Return value: promise Locators: Find page elements Locators are a collection of factory functions for creating locator instances. Locators find DOM elements, which can be passed to functions such as $browser.findElement. Call them through $driver.By. Function Description $driver.By.className(className: string) Locates an element that has a specific class name. The returned locator is equivalent to searching for elements with the CSS selector .clazz. Return value: locator $driver.By.css(cssName: string) Locates an element using a CSS selector. Return value: locator $driver.By.id(id: string) Locates an element by its ID. Return value: locator $driver.By.linkText(linkText: string) Locates link elements whose visible text matches the given string. Return value: locator $driver.By.js(js: string) Locates an element by evaluating a JavaScript expression. Return value: locator $driver.By.name(name: string) Locates elements whose name attribute has the given value. Return value: locator $driver.By.partialLinkText(partialLinkText: string) Locates link elements whose getText visible contains the given substring. Return value: locator $driver.By.tagName(tagName: string) Locates elements with a given tag name. The returned locator is equivalent to using the getElementsByTagName DOM function. Return value: locator $driver.By.xpath(xpath: string) Locates elements matching a XPath selector. Return value: locator WebElement: Interact with page elements When a function such as $browser.findElement or $browser.waitForAndFindElement returns a WebElement reference, these functions can be used to interact with that element. For example, you can click on buttons, sent text to form inputs, and get attributes of elements to test. Function Description click() Clicks on this element. Return value: self reference sendKeys(var_args: ?) Schedules a command to type a sequence on the DOM element represented by this instance. Return value: WebElement getTagName() Schedules a command to query for the tag/node name of this element. Return value: WebElement getCssValue(name: string) Schedules a command to query for the computed style of the element represented by this instance. If the element inherits the named style from its parent, the parent will be queried for its value. Where possible, color values will be converted to their hex representation (for example, #00ff00 instead of rgb(0, 255, 0)). Return value: promise getAttribute(name: string) Schedules a command to query for the value of the given attribute of the element. Return value: promise getText(name: string) Get the visible (not hidden by CSS) innerText of this element, including sub-elements, without any leading or trailing white space. Return value: promise getSize() Schedules a command to compute the size of this element's bounding box, in pixels. Return value: promise getLocation() Schedules a command to compute the location of this element, in page space. Return value: promise isEnabled() Schedules a command to query whether the DOM element represented by this instance is enabled, as dictated by the disabled attribute. Return value: promise isSelected() Schedules a command to query whether this element is selected. Return value: promise submit() Schedules a command to submit the form containing this element (or this element if it is a FORM element). This command is a no-op if the element is not contained in a form. Return value: promise clear() Schedules a command to clear the value of this element. Return value: promise isDisplayed() Schedules a command to test whether this element is currently displayed. Return value: promise ActionSequence: Link multiple actions Action sequences can create complex user interactions with your website. To create a new action sequence, use $browser.actions(). To link multiple actions together into a sequence, include perform() after each. This executes and then terminates individual sequences, including single-action sequences. The following table contains a list of available actions. For more information, see the WebDriver ActionSequence documentation on GitHub. Function Description click(opt_elementOrButton: ?, opt_button: ?) Clicks a mouse button. If an element is provided, the mouse will first be moved to the center of that element. This is equivalent to WebElement.click(). Return value: actionsequence doubleClick(opt_elementOrButton: ?, opt_button: ?) Double-clicks a mouse button. If an element is provided, the mouse will first be moved to the center of that element. Return value: actionsequence dragAndDrop(element: ?, location: ?) Convenience function for performing a drag and drop maneuver. The target element may be moved to the location of another element, or by an offset (in pixels). The location is an object with two properties x and y: {x: x_offset, y: y_offset}. Return value: actionsequence keyDown(key: ?) Performs a modifier key press. Must be one of ALT, CONTROL, SHIFT, COMMAND, or META. The modifier key is not released until keyUp() or sendKeys() is called. The key press will be targeted at the currently focused element. Return value: actionsequence keyUp(key: ?) Performs a modifier key release. The release is targeted at the currently focused element. Return value: actionsequence mouseDown(opt_elementOrButton: ?, opt_button: ?) Presses a mouse button. The mouse button will not be released until mouseUp is called, regardless of whether that call is made in this sequence or another. The behavior for out-of-order events (such as calling mouseDown() or click() when the button is already held down) is undefined. Return value: actionsequence mouseUp(opt_elementOrButton: ?, opt_button: ?) Releases a mouse button. Behavior is undefined for calling this function without a previous call to mouseDown(). Return value: actionsequence mouseMove(location: ?, offset: ?) Moves the mouse. The location to move to may be specified in terms of the mouse's current location, an offset relative to the top-left corner of an element, or an element (in which case the middle of the element is used). Return value: actionsequence perform() Executes this action sequence. Return value: promise sendKeys(args: ?) Simulates typing multiple keys. Each modifier key encountered in the sequence will not be released until it is encountered again. All key events will be targeted at the currently focused element. For a full list of supported non-alphanumeric keys, see the WebDriver enum key documentation on GitHub. Return value: actionsequence Promises: Link actions into sequences You can also execute functions directly on promises. Synthetic monitoring is a native Node.js environment and uses standard Node.js promises. These functions evaluate the status of promises, cancel them, and more. In particular, you can create sequences of actions with the then() function and its siblings, finally() and catch(). For more information, see Sequence actions. Function Description isPending() Whether this promise's value is still being computed. Return value: boolean then(opt_callback: fn(T: ?), opt_errback: fn()) Registers listeners for when this instance is resolved. This is the basic function used to link synchronous actions in your script. Return value: promise finally(callback: fn()) Registers a listener to invoke when this promise is resolved, regardless of whether the promise's value was successfully computed. Return value: promise catch(callback: fn()) Registers a listener for when this promise is rejected. Return value: promise Navigate: Move through browser history The $browser.navigate() function exposes a number of functions that allow you to move backwards and forwards through your browser history, refresh your page and navigate to new pages. Function Description back() Move back by one step in the browser's history. Return value: void forward() Move forward by one step in the browser's history. Return value: void refresh() Refresh the current page. Return value: void to(string: url) Load a new webpage in the current browser window. $browser.navigate().to() is equivalent to $browser.get(). Return value: void Conditions: Pause and wait for conditions Tip You can learn more about waits in Selenium here. Used with $browser.wait, until pauses your script execution until the condition is matched. For more information, see Selenium's WebDriver until documentation. The following are available functions for $driver.until.Condition: Function Description ableToSwitchToFrame(frame: ?) Creates a condition that will wait until the input driver is able to switch to the designated frame. The target frame may be specified as: A numeric index into window.frames for the current frame A webdriver.WebElement, which must reference a FRAME or IFRAME element on the current page A locator which may be used to first locate a FRAME or IFRAME on the current page before attempting to switch to it Upon successful resolution of this condition, the driver will be left focused on the new frame. Return value: condition alertIsPresent() Creates a condition that waits for an alert to be opened. Upon success, the returned promise will be fulfilled with the handle for the opened alert. Return value: condition elementIsDisabled(element: $driver.WebElement) Creates a condition that will wait for the given element to be disabled. Return value: condition elementIsEnabled(element: $driver.WebElement) Creates a condition that will wait for the given element to be enabled. Return value: condition elementIsNotVisible(element: $driver.WebElement) Creates a condition that will wait for the given element to be in the DOM, yet not visible to the user. Return value: condition elementIsVisible(element: $driver.WebElement) Creates a condition that will wait for the given element to become visible. Return value: condition elementIsSelected(element: $driver.WebElement) Creates a condition that will wait for the given element to be selected. Return value: condition elementLocated(element: $driver.Locator) Creates a condition that will loop until an element is found with the given locator. Return value: condition elementsLocated(element: $driver.Locator) Creates a condition that will loop until at least one element is found with the given locator. Return value: condition n elementTextContains(element: $driver.WebElement, substr: string) Creates a condition that will wait for the given element's visible text to contain the given substring. Return value: condition elementTextIs(element: $driver.WebElement, text: string) Case sensitive. Creates a condition that will wait for the given element's visible text to match the given text exactly. Return value: condition n elementTextMatches(element: $driver.WebElement, regex: string) Creates a condition that will wait for the given element's visible text to match a regular expression. Return value: condition stalenessOf(element: $driver.WebElement) Creates a condition that will wait for the given element to become stale. An element is considered stale once it is removed from the DOM or a new page has loaded. Return value: condition titleContains(substr: string) Creates a condition that will wait for the current page's title to contain the given substring. Return value: condition titleIs(title: string) Creates a condition that will wait for the current page's title to match the given value. Return value: condition titleMatches(regex: string) Creates a condition that will wait for the current page's title to match the given regular expression. Return value: condition",

In particular: $driver provides all the exports from the selenium-webdriver module (for example, ActionSequence, Button, By, WebElement, etc.). $browser is a synthetic-flavored instance of selenium-webdriver.WebDriver(): it exposes the main basic WebDriver APIs like get() and findElement(), as well as some synthetic custom APIs. This document describes the functions available for synthetic scripted browser monitors version 0.4.0 or lower. For the newest monitor documentation, see monitor version 0.5.0+ documentation. Other relevant documentation: For more on synthetic scripting, see Write scripted browsers. For example scripts, see Scripted browser examples. For more information about monitor versions and runtime differences, see Runtime environments. To view and share scripted browser examples, check out topics tagged synthetic-script in New Relic's Explorers Hub. Top-level functions: Build your script New Relic calls top-level functions directly from your $browser instance. These provide a wide range of functionality that covers many basic scriptable actions. Function Return value $browser.actions() Creates a new action sequence using this driver. For a list of available actions, see ActionSequence: Link multiple actions. void $browser.addHeader(headerKey: string, headerValue: string) Adds header headerKey with value headerValue to the runtime. void $browser.addHeaders(headers: ?) Adds a map of headers to the runtime. void $browser.deleteHeader(header: string) Deletes a specific header from the runtime. void $browser.deleteHeaders(header: [string]) Deletes all headers in argument from runtime. void $browser.addHostnameToBlacklist(hostname: string) Disallows a hostname. Allows use wildcards. void $browser.addHostnamesToBlacklist(hostnameArr: [string]) Disallows all hostnames in an array of arguments. Allows use wildcards. void $browser.addHostnameToWhitelist(hostname: string) Allows a hostname blocked by default in synthetic monitoring. void $browser.addHostnamesToWhitelist(hostnameArr: [string]) Allows all hostnames in argument. void $browser.deleteHostnameFromBlacklist(hostname: string) Removes a hostname from this browser instance's blacklist. void $browser.deleteHostnamesFromBlacklist(hostnameArr: [string]) Removes all hostnames in argument from the disallowed list. void $browser.deleteHostnameFromWhitelist(hostnameArr: [string]) Removes a hostname from this browser instance's allowed list. void $browser.deleteHostnamesFromWhitelist(hostnameArr: [string]) Removes all hostnames in argument from this browser instance's allowed list. void $browser.executeAsyncScript(script: ?, var_args: ?) Schedules a command to execute asynchronous JavaScript in the context of the currently selected frame or window. promise $browser.executeScript(script: ?, var_args: ?) Schedules a command to execute JavaScript in the context of the currently selected frame or window. promise $browser.findElement(locator: $driver.Locator) Schedule a command to find an element on the page. If not found, New Relic returns an error. WebElement $browser.findElements(locator: $driver.Locator) Schedule a command to search for multiple elements on the page. promise $browser.waitForAndFindElement(locator: $driver.Locator [, timeout: number) Schedule a command to wait for and find an element on the page, and another command to wait for it to be visible. If not found, New Relic returns an error. The timeout value is an optional one, and gets applied separately to both tasks of finding the element and waiting for its visibility. This means at worst case, this method can take up to twice the provided timeout value. The default timeout value is 1000 ms (1 second). promise $browser.get(url: string) Loads a webpage in a synthetic browser. promise $browser.getAllWindowHandles() Schedules a command to retrieve the current list of available window handles. promise $browser.getCapabilities() A promise that will resolve with the instance's capabilities. promise $browser.getCurrentUrl() Schedules a command to retrieve the URL of the current page. promise $browser.getHeaders() Returns a map of currently configured headers. map $browser.getPageSource() Schedules a command to retrieve the current page's source. The page source returned is a representation of the underlying DOM; do not expect it to be formatted or escaped in the same way as the response sent from the web server. promise $browser.getSession() A promise for this client's session. promise $browser.getTitle() Schedules a command to retrieve the current page's title. promise $browser.getWindowHandle() Schedules a command to retrieve the current window handle. promise $browser.isElementPresent(locatorOrElement: $driver.Locator) Schedules a command to test if an element is present on the page. If given a DOM element, this function will check if it belongs to the document the driver is currently focused on. Otherwise, the function will test if at least one element can be found with the given search criteria. promise $browser.manage() The options interface for this instance. You can manage cookies, timeouts, and other window options. void $browser.navigate() The navigation interface (history of browser functions) for this instance. void $browser.schedule(command: ?, description: string) Schedules a command to be executed by this driver's CommandExecutor. promise $browser.sleep() Schedules a command to make the driver sleep for the given amount of time. promise $browser.switchTo() The target locator interface for this instance. void $browser.takeScreenshot() Schedule a command to take a screenshot. promise $browser.wait(fn: $driver.until.Condition, timeout: number, opt_message: string) Schedules a command to wait for a condition to hold, as defined by some user supplied function. webElement $browser.waitForPendingRequests(timeout: number) Causes the script to wait for requests that have been initiated to return, up to the timeout. Useful for tracking non-blocking resources. promise Disallow list: Wildcard use Disallowing domains for your browser instance requires wildcards to match the URL syntax of the URL to be blocked. An overall .com disallowed list needs to contain these functions: Function Blocking action $browser.addHostnameToBlacklist('*.com'); a.com $browser.addHostnameToBlacklist('*.*.com'); a.b.com $browser.addHostnameToBlacklist('*.*.*.com'); a.b.c.com $browser.addHostnameToBlacklist('www.*.com'); www.a.com $browser.addHostnameToBlacklist('www.*.*.com'); www.a.b.com $browser.addHostnameToBlacklist('www.*.*.*.com'); www.a.b.c.com Options: Manage the browser instance These functions manage options for your browser instance such as cookies, timeouts and window size. Access these options through the $browser.manage() function. Function Return value $browser.manage().addCookie(name: string, value: string, opt_path: string, opt_domain: string, opt_isSecure: boolean, opt_expiry: number) Schedules a command to add a cookie. promise $browser.manage().deleteAllCookies() Schedules a command to delete all cookies visible to the current page. promise $browser.manage().deleteCookie(name: string) Schedules a command to delete the cookie with the given name. This command is a no-op if there is no cookie with the given name visible to the current page. promise $browser.manage().getCookie(name: string) Schedules a command to retrieve the cookie with the given name. Returns null if there is no such cookie. The cookie will be returned as a JSON object as described by the WebDriver wire protocol. promise $browser.manage().getCookies() Schedules a command to retrieve all cookies visible to the current page. New Relic Syntheticcs returns each cookie as a JSON object as described by the WebDriver wire protocol. promise $browser.manage().timeouts().implicitlyWait(ms: number) Specifies the amount of time the driver should wait when searching for an element if it is not immediately present. Setting the wait timeout to 0 disables implicit waiting. Be careful increasing the wait timeout, as it will increase test run time, especially with slower location strategies like XPath. Default is 10 seconds. promise $browser.manage().timeouts().pageLoadTimeout(ms: number) Sets the amount of time to wait for a page load to complete before returning an error. If the timeout is negative, page loads may last up to 180 seconds. Default is 60 seconds. promise $browser.manage().timeouts().setScriptTimeout(ms: number) Sets the amount of time to wait, in milliseconds, for an asynchronous script to finish execution before returning an error. Default is 30 seconds. promise $browser.manage().window().getPosition() Retrieves the window's current position, relative to the top left corner of the screen. promise $browser.manage().window().getSize() Retrieves the window's current size. promise $browser.manage().window().maximize() Maximizes the current window. promise $browser.manage().window().setPosition(x: number, y: number) Repositions the current window. promise $browser.manage().window().setSize(width: number, height: number) Resizes the current window. promise Locators: Find page elements Locators are a collection of factory functions for creating locator instances. Locators find DOM elements, which can be passed to functions such as $browser.findElement or $browser.isElementPresent. Call them through $driver.By. Function Return value $driver.By.className(className: string) Locates an element that has a specific class name. The returned locator is equivalent to searching for elements with the CSS selector .clazz. locator $driver.By.css(cssName: string) Locates an element using a CSS selector. locator $driver.By.id(id: string) Locates an element by its ID. locator $driver.By.linkText(linkText: string) Locates link elements whose visible text matches the given string. locator $driver.By.js(js: string) Locates an element by evaluating a JavaScript expression. locator $driver.By.name(name: string) Locates elements whose name attribute has the given value. locator $driver.By.partialLinkText(partialLinkText: string) Locates link elements whose getText visible contains the given substring. locator $driver.By.tagName(tagName: string) Locates elements with a given tag name. The returned locator is equivalent to using the getElementsByTagName DOM function. locator $driver.By.xpath(xpath: string) Locates elements matching a XPath selector. locator WebElement: Interact with page elements When a function such as $browser.findElement or $browser.waitForAndFindElement returns a WebElement reference, these functions can be used to interact with that element. Using these, you can click on buttons, sent text to form inputs, and get attributes of elements to test. Function Return value click() Clicks on this element. void sendKeys(var_args: ?) Schedules a command to type a sequence on the DOM element represented by this instance. WebElement getTagName() Schedules a command to query for the tag/node name of this element. WebElement getCssValue(name: string) Schedules a command to query for the computed style of the element represented by this instance. If the element inherits the named style from its parent, the parent will be queried for its value. Where possible, color values will be converted to their hex representation (for example, #00ff00 instead of rgb(0, 255, 0)). promise getAttribute(name: string) Schedules a command to query for the value of the given attribute of the element. promise getText(name: string) Get the visible (not hidden by CSS) innerText of this element, including sub-elements, without any leading or trailing white space. promise getSize() Schedules a command to compute the size of this element's bounding box, in pixels. promise getLocation() Schedules a command to compute the location of this element, in page space. promise isEnabled() Schedules a command to query whether the DOM element represented by this instance is enabled, as dictated by the disabled attribute. promise isSelected() Schedules a command to query whether this element is selected. promise submit() Schedules a command to submit the form containing this element (or this element if it is a FORM element). This command is a no-op if the element is not contained in a form. promise clear() Schedules a command to clear the value of this element. promise isDisplayed() Schedules a command to test whether this element is currently displayed. promise getOuterHtml() Schedules a command to retrieve the outer HTML of this element. promise getInnerHtml() Schedules a command to retrieve the inner HTML of this element. promise ActionSequence: Link multiple actions Action sequences can create complex user interactions with your website. To create a new action sequence, use $browser.actions(). To link multiple actions together into a sequence, include perform() after each. This executes and then terminates individual sequences, including single-action sequences. The following table contains a list of available actions. For more information, see the WebDriver ActionSequence documentation. Function Return value click(opt_elementOrButton: ?, opt_button: ?) Clicks a mouse button. If an element is provided, the mouse will first be moved to the center of that element. This is equivalent to WebElement.click(). actionsequence doubleClick(opt_elementOrButton: ?, opt_button: ?) Double-clicks a mouse button. If an element is provided, the mouse will first be moved to the center of that element. actionsequence dragAndDrop(element: ?, location: ?) Convenience function for performing a \"drag and drop\" maneuver. The target element may be moved to the location of another element, or by an offset (in pixels). The location is an object with two properties x and y: {x: x_offset, y: y_offset}. actionsequence keyDown(key: ?) Performs a modifier key press. Must be one of ALT, CONTROL, SHIFT, COMMAND, or META. The modifier key is not released until keyUp() or sendKeys() is called. The key press will be targeted at the currently focused element. actionsequence keyUp(key: ?) Performs a modifier key release. The release is targeted at the currently focused element. actionsequence mouseDown(opt_elementOrButton: ?, opt_button: ?) Presses a mouse button. The mouse button will not be released until mouseUp is called, regardless of whether that call is made in this sequence or another. The behavior for out-of-order events (such as calling mouseDown() or click() when the button is already held down) is undefined. actionsequence mouseUp(opt_elementOrButton: ?, opt_button: ?) Releases a mouse button. Behavior is undefined for calling this function without a previous call to mouseDown(). actionsequence mouseMove(location: ?, offset: ?) Moves the mouse. The location to move to may be specified in terms of the mouse's current location, an offset relative to the top-left corner of an element, or an element (in which case the middle of the element is used). actionsequence perform() Executes this action sequence. promise sendKeys(args: ?) Simulates typing multiple keys. Each modifier key encountered in the sequence will not be released until it is encountered again. All key events will be targeted at the currently focused element. For a full list of supported non-alphanumeric keys, see the WebDriver enum key documentation. actionsequence Promises: Link actions into sequences You can also execute functions directly on promises. Synthetic monitoring is a native Node.js environment and uses standard Node.js promises. These functions evaluate the status of promises, cancel them, and more. In particular, you can create sequences of actions with the then() function and its siblings, thenFinally() and thenCatch(). For more information, see Sequence actions. Function Return value cancel(string: reason) Cancels the computation of this promise's value, rejecting the promise in the process. This method is a no-op if the promise has already been resolved. void isPending() Whether this promise's value is still being computed. boolean then(opt_callback: fn(T: ?), opt_errback: fn()) Registers listeners for when this instance is resolved. This is the basic function used to link synchronous actions in your script. promise thenFinally(callback: fn()) Registers a listener to invoke when this promise is resolved, regardless of whether the promise's value was successfully computed. promise thenCatch(callback: fn()) Registers a listener for when this promise is rejected. promise Navigate: Move through browser history The $browser.navigate() function exposes a number of functions that allow you to move backwards and forwards through your browser history, refresh your page and navigate to new pages. Function Return value back() Move back by one step in the browser's history. void forward() Move forward by one step in the browser's history. void refresh() Refresh the current page. void to(string: url) Load a new webpage in the current browser window. $browser.navigate().to() is equivalent to $browser.get(). void Conditions: Pause and wait for conditions Used with $browser.wait, until pauses your script execution until the condition is matched. For more information on explicit and implicit waits, see the WebDriver documentation. For .wait and .until usage examples, see Webdriver.wait examples. The following are available functions for $driver.until.Condition: Function Return value ableToSwitchToFrame(frame: ?) Creates a condition that will wait until the input driver is able to switch to the designated frame. The target frame may be specified as: A numeric index into window.frames for the current frame A webdriver.WebElement, which must reference a FRAME or IFRAME element on the current page A locator which may be used to first locate a FRAME or IFRAME on the current page before attempting to switch to it Upon successful resolution of this condition, the driver will be left focused on the new frame. condition alertIsPresent() Creates a condition that waits for an alert to be opened. Upon success, the returned promise will be fulfilled with the handle for the opened alert. condition elementIsDisabled(element: $driver.WebElement) Creates a condition that will wait for the given element to be disabled. condition elementIsEnabled(element: $driver.WebElement) Creates a condition that will wait for the given element to be enabled. condition elementIsNotVisible(element: $driver.WebElement) Creates a condition that will wait for the given element to be in the DOM, yet not visible to the user. condition elementIsVisible(element: $driver.WebElement) Creates a condition that will wait for the given element to become visible. condition elementIsSelected(element: $driver.WebElement) Creates a condition that will wait for the given element to be selected. condition elementLocated(element: $driver.Locator) Creates a condition that will loop until an element is found with the given locator. condition elementsLocated(element: $driver.Locator) Creates a condition that will loop until at least one element is found with the given locator. condition elementTextContains(element: $driver.WebElement, substr: string) Creates a condition that will wait for the given element's visible text to contain the given substring. condition elementTextIs(element: $driver.WebElement, text: string) Case sensitive. Creates a condition that will wait for the given element's visible text to match the given text exactly. condition elementTextMatches(element: $driver.WebElement, regex: string) Creates a condition that will wait for the given element's visible text to match a regular expression. condition stalenessOf(element: $driver.WebElement) Creates a condition that will wait for the given element to become stale. An element is considered stale once it is removed from the DOM, or a new page has loaded. condition titleContains(substr: string) Creates a condition that will wait for the current page's title to contain the given substring. condition titleIs(title: string) Creates a condition that will wait for the current page's title to match the given value. condition titleMatches(regex: string) Creates a condition that will wait for the current page's title to match the given regular expression. condition",

      "body": "Read on to learn about synthetic monitoring's proxy settings and properties. Proxy settings API for scripted monitors Important You can set proxy server configuration for synthetic scripted monitors for monitor versions 0.4.0 or higher. The global object $network allows you to control the network configuration used by your synthetic scripted monitors. The following are applicable for both scripted browsers and API tests, unless otherwise stated. $network.setProxy(string or object PROXY URL) Sets a proxy server to be used for all per-URL requests (HTTP, HTTPS, and FTP). Additional notes: The port is optional. If not provided, it will be derived from the scheme. For example, for HTTP the port would be 80. The username and password are assumed to be the result of a call to encodeURIComponent(). Special characters like @ and : in the username and/or the password must be escaped. Returns This method returns a Promise that will resolve once the configuration has been applied. Parameters Parameter Data Type Description proxyURL | proxyUrlParsed String or Object The URL to connect to the proxy server. A string containing a proxyURL (for example, http://proxy_host:8888) or a plain object in the same format as defined by Node's url.parse(urlString) method. Examples An example of setting a proxy server with HTTP protocol on port 1234 with no authentication: $network.setProxy('http://host.com:1234') Copy An example of setting a proxy server with HTTP protocol with authentication credentials. $network.setProxy('http://proxyUsername:proxyPassword@proxyHost:1234') Copy $network.setProxyForHttp(string or object PROXY URL) Tip This call is exactly the same as the per-URL setProxy call, except that it applies to HTTP traffic. Sets a proxy server to be used for all HTTP requests. Additional notes: The port is optional. If not provided, it will be derived from the scheme. For example, for HTTP the port would be 80. The username and password are assumed to be the result of a call to encodeURIComponent(). Special characters like @ and : in the username and/or the password must be escaped. Returns This method returns a Promise that will resolve once the configuration has been applied. Parameters Parameter Data Type Description proxyURL | proxyUrlParsed String or Object The URL to connect to the proxy server. A string containing a proxyURL (for example, http://proxy_host:8888) or a plain object in the same format as defined by Node's url.parse(urlString) method. Examples An example of setting a proxy server with HTTP protocol on port 1234 with no authentication: $network.setProxyForHttp('http://host.com:1234') Copy An example of setting a proxy server with HTTP protocol with authentication credentials. $network.setProxyForHttp('http://proxyUsername:proxyPassword@proxyHost:1234') Copy $network.setProxyForHttps(string or object PROXY URL) Tip This call is exactly the same as the per-URL setProxy call, except that it applies to HTTPS traffic. Sets a proxy server to be used for all HTTPS requests. Additional notes: The port is optional. If not provided, it will be derived from the scheme. For example, for HTTP the default port would be 443. The username and password are assumed to be the result of a call to encodeURIComponent(). Special characters like @ and : in the username and/or the password must be escaped. Returns This method returns a Promise that will resolve once the configuration has been applied. Parameters Parameter Data Type Description proxyURL | proxyUrlParsed String or Object The URL to connect to the proxy server. A string containing a proxyURL (for example, http://proxy_host:8888) or a plain object in the same format as defined by Node's url.parse(urlString) method. Examples An example of setting a proxy server with HTTPS protocol on port 1234 with no authentication: $network.setProxyForHttps('https://host.com:1234') Copy An example of setting a proxy server with HTTPS protocol with authentication credentials. $network.setProxyForHttps('https://proxyUsername:proxyPassword@proxyHost:1234') Copy $network.setProxyPAC(string PAC SCRIPT URL, object AUTH OBJECT) Sets a proxy server via a proxy auto-config (PAC) script and returns a promise. This function is only available for scripted browser monitors. Returns This method returns a Promise that will resolve once the configuration has been applied. Parameters Parameter Data Type Description scriptURL String The URL of the PAC script. authCredentialsMap Object Map of authentication credentials to be provided to the proxy server(s), keyed by the hostnames of the proxy server. Values of this map must be defined in the format {username: 'authUsername', password: 'authPassword'} Examples An example of setting a proxy server via a proxy auto-config (PAC) script: var authCredentialsMap = { 'example.com': {username: 'authUsername', password: 'authPassword'}, } Copy Here's an example of setting up a proxied network via proxy auto-config (PAC) script: var authCredentialsMap = { 'example.com': {username: 'authUsername', password: 'authPassword'}, 'anotherExample.com': {username: 'authUsername', password: 'authPassword'}, } $network.setProxyPAC(\"https://www.example.com/pacScript\", authCredentialsMap) Copy $network.setProxyAdvanced(object PROXY RULES OBJECT) Tip This method is Chrome-specific: it only applies to scripted browser monitor types. It can be used to allow for a more flexible and complex proxy configuration. In most cases, this method will not be needed. Sets the proxy configuration using the format supported by Chrome Extension API for Proxying. The input is a ProxyRules object, as defined by the Chrome Extension API to configures proxies. You can add authCredentials for proxies that need it. See Parameters for more details. Returns This method returns a Promise that will resolve once the configuration has been applied. Parameters Parameter Data Type Description ProxyRules Object Object The proxyRulesObject is a plain object that follows the format ProxyRules as defined by the Chrome Extension API to configures proxies. This object is \"flavoured\" to fit our runtime: users can define an additional property, authCredentials, for the Proxy server objects to provide authentication credentials for a specific proxy server. authCredentials is an object in the format {username: 'authUsername', password: 'authPassword'}. Examples Here's an example of creating a proxyRules with authCredentials: var proxyRules = { singleProxy: { host:\"example.com\", authCredentials: { username: 'authUsername', password: 'authPassword' } } }; Copy Here's an example of setting up a proxied network with mixed network zone assets: var proxyRules = {singleProxy: {host:\"http://entproxy.mycompany.com\"}, bypassList:['s3.amazonaws.com','*.localcdn.com'] } $network.setProxyAdvanced(proxyRules) Copy $network.clearProxy() Clears/removes the current proxy configuration. Returns This method returns a Promise that will resolve once the configuration has been applied. $network.getProxy() This method returns the current proxy configuration. It must be synchronized in a promise callback. Examples An example of synchronizing getProxy with $network.setProxy(); and $network.clearProxy();: var assert = require('assert'); $network.setProxy(\"http://user:password@myproxyurl.com\") .then(function () { console.log('Proxy configuration applied'); //Note: $network.getProxy() is not synchronized with the webdriver Control Flow. //To make sure we get the proxy configuration after the call to setProxy() above // succeeds we need to use a promise callback var proxyData = $network.getProxy(); console.log(proxyData); }) .then(function () { // Again: getProxy() is not synchronized with the Webdriver Control Flow: we //need this promise callback otherwise clearProxy() might be called before the call // to getProxy() above returns return $network.clearProxy(); }) .then(function () { console.log('Proxy configuration cleared'); // We need this promise callback for reasons explained above var proxyData = $network.getProxy(); assert.equal(proxyData.rules, null); }); Copy Proxy properties Important This proxy information applies only to these versions: API monitors: 0.4.0, 0.2.2, 0.2.1, 0.1.0 Scripted monitors: 0.1.0 In order to analyze and collect your HTTP traffic metrics, New Relic must ensure the traffic passes through a conceptual funnel. Our synthetic monitoring includes a software funnel component capable of analyzing the HTTP requests or responses and then recording the information. New Relic's scripted browser monitors (versions 0.4.x and lower) include a mechanism to do this analysis without needing an HTTP proxy, so you don't have to configure anything. New Relic's API test (versions 0.4.x and lower) provides an $http object that is pre-configured to make the requests pass through the internal HTTP proxy. This allows you to write your test without including any proxy settings. If you want to use some other way to generate HTTP traffic while still collecting the HTTP traffic metrics, you can use $env.PROXY_HOST and $env.PROXY_PORT. To record traffic metrics, be sure to include these properties in your script.",

      "body": "Use synthetic monitoring's API tests to monitor your API endpoint to ensure it is functioning correctly. New Relic uses the http-request module internally to make HTTP calls to your endpoint and validate the results. Here we present some example functions showing how to use the $http object to submit your request. For detailed documentation on the options available for this object, see the http-request readme. (Note that Request is deprecated, but these options still apply.) Tip To view and share other API test examples, visit the synthetics scripts section in Explorers Hub. Use API http-request module API tests are powered by the http-request module, which is available through the $http object. Once each frequency interval, New Relic queries your endpoint from each of your selected locations. For instructions on creating a monitor, see Adding monitors. Read on to learn how to define metadata for your request, make a GET request, make a POST request, and how to validate the results. Important After a maximum run time of three minutes, New Relic manually stops the script. one.newrelic.com > Synthetics > Create monitor: The script editor suggests functions, selectors, and other elements to simplify scripting commands (available in GitHub). Configure request options To start your script: Declare a variable (such as options) to store your request options object. Define request options such as the URL endpoint, and custom headers. If you're setting SSL or agent options, see SSL and agentOptions requirements. We recommend using SSL to avoid exposing plain text credentials in your headers. Tip For a full list of supported request options, see request(options, callback) in the http-request documentation on GitHub. Here's an example of optional metadata in the options object: Using optional metadata //Declare optional metadata var options = { //Specify the endpoint URL url: 'https://api-endpoint.example.com', //Specify optional headers headers: { 'Endpoint-Key': 'uqNTC57Phe72pnnB8JuJmwAr7b09nKSKSz', 'Additional-Header': 'Additional-Header-Data' } }; Copy For SSL and agentOptions: If you are setting SSL options or providing an agentOptions object, the agent property in the request options object will need to be set to $globalAgents.https or $globalAgents.http to ensure your HTTP requests use the instrumented global agent. Here's an example of using a SSL option or agentOptions: Using a SSL option or agentOptions This example uses agentOptions: //Declare optional metadata var options = { //Specify the endpoint URL url: 'https://api-endpoint.example.com', //Specify optional headers headers: { 'Endpoint-Key': 'uqNTC57Phe72pnnB8JuJmwAr7b09nKSKSz', 'Additional-Header': 'Additional-Header-Data' } //Specify global agent as the http agent agent: $globalAgents.https, //Set SSL option strictSSL: true, //Specify http agent options agentOptions: { ​maxVersion: 'TLSv1.1' }, }; Copy Send a GET request To make a GET request, use the $http.get method to submit your request. Define your request options, make your request using $http.get, then validate the response to ensure your endpoint is returning the correct results. Insights GET example This example queries the Insights API by using GET: //Define your authentication credentials var myAccountID = '{YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID}'; var myQueryKey = '{YOUR_QUERY_KEY}'; var options = { //Define endpoint URI uri: 'https://insights-api.newrelic.com/v1/accounts/'+myAccountID+'/query?nrql=SELECT%20average(duration)%20FROM%20Transaction', //Define query key and expected data type. headers: { 'X-Query-Key': myQueryKey, 'Accept': 'application/json' } }; //Define expected results using callback function. function callback (err, response, body){ //Log JSON results from endpoint to Synthetics console. console.log(JSON.parse(body)); console.log('done with script'); } //Make GET request, passing in options and callback. $http.get(options,callback); Copy Send a POST request To make a POST request, use the $http.post method to submit your request. Define your request options, make your request using $http.post, then validate the response to ensure your endpoint is returning the correct results. Custom event POST example This example POSTs a custom event containing static integers to the Event API: //Define your authentication credentials. var myAccountID = '{YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID}'; var myLicenseKey = '{YOUR_LICENSE_KEY}'; //Import the 'assert' module to validate results. var assert = require('assert'); var options = { //Define endpoint URL. url: \"https://insights-collector.newrelic.com/v1/accounts/\"+myAccountID+\"/events\", //Define body of POST request. body: '[{\"eventType\":\"SyntheticsEvent\",\"integer1\":1000,\"integer2\":2000}]', //Define New Relic license key and expected data type. headers: { 'Api-Key': myLicenseKey, 'Content-Type': 'application/json' } }; //Define expected results using callback function. function callback(error, response, body) { //Log status code to Synthetics console. console.log(response.statusCode + \" status code\") //Verify endpoint returns 200 (OK) response code. assert.ok(response.statusCode == 200, 'Expected 200 OK response'); //Parse JSON received from Insights into variable. var info = JSON.parse(body); //Verify that `info` contains element named `success` with a value of `true`. assert.ok(info.success == true, 'Expected True results in Response Body, result was ' + info.success); //Log end of script. console.log(\"End reached\"); } //Make POST request, passing in options and callback. $http.post(options, callback); Copy Validate results To validate your results, import the assert module to define your test case. Call an assert method to validate your endpoint's response. If any assert functions fail, the entire monitor will be considered a failed check. This may trigger alert notifications and affect your metrics. Important Synthetic monitoring does not allow thrown exceptions. Thrown exceptions result in script failure. Use the assert module to validate your results, and use console.log() to log results to the synthetic's console. Event API validation example This example POSTs to the Event API, then validates that the response is {\"success\":true}: //Define your authentication credentials. var myAccountID = '{YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID}'; var myLicenseKey = '{YOUR_LICENSE_KEY}'; //Import the `assert` module to validate results. var assert = require('assert'); var options = { //Define endpoint URL. url: \"https://insights-collector.newrelic.com/v1/accounts/\"+myAccountID+\"/events\", //Define body of POST request. body: '[{\"eventType\":\"SyntheticsEvent\",\"integer1\":1000,\"integer2\":2000}]', //Define New Relic license key and expected data type. headers: { 'Api-Key': myLicenseKey, 'Content-Type': 'application/json' } }; $http.post(options, function(error, response, body) { //Log status code to Synthetics console. The status code is logged before the `assert` function, //because a failed assert function ends the script. console.log(response.statusCode + \" status code\") //Call `assert` method, expecting a `200` response code. //If assertion fails, log `Expected 200 OK response` as error message to Synthetics console. assert.ok(response.statusCode == 200, 'Expected 200 OK response'); var info = JSON.parse(body); //Call `assert` method, expecting body to return `{\"success\":true}`. //If assertion fails, log `Expected True results in Response Body,` plus results as error message to Synthetics console. assert.ok(info.success == true, 'Expected True results in Response Body, result was ' + info.success); }); Copy",

      "body": "This document describes scripted browser functions available for synthetic monitors versions 0.5.x or higher. If you are using older monitor versions, see the monitor version 0.4.0 and lower documentation. For more on monitor versions and runtime differences, see Runtime environments. Selenium Webdriver APIs The synthetic scripted browsers provide access to the Selenium Webdriver APIs 3.6.0 for monitor version 0.6.x and Selenium Webdriver APIs 3.5.0 for monitor version 0.5.x via the variables $driver and $browser. In particular: $driver provides all the exports from the selenium-webdriver module (for example, ActionSequence, Button, By, WebElement, etc.). $browser is a synthetic monitoring instance of selenium-webdriver.WebDriver(). It exposes the main basic WebDriver APIs like get() and findElement(), as well as some synthetic custom APIs. Top-level functions: Build your script New Relic calls top-level functions directly from your $browser instance. These provide a wide range of functionality that covers many basic scriptable actions. Function Description $browser.actions() Creates a new action sequence using this driver. For a list of available actions, see ActionSequence. Return value: void $browser.addHeader(headerKey: string, headerValue: string) Adds header headerKey with value headerValue to the runtime. Return value: void $browser.addHeaders(headers: ?) Adds a map of headers to the runtime. Return value: void $browser.deleteHeader(header: string) Deletes a specific header from the runtime.

Return value: void $browser.deleteHostnamesFromBlacklist(hostnameArr: [string]) Removes all hostnames in the argument from your deny list. Return value: void $browser.deleteHostnameFromWhitelist(hostnameArr: [string]) Removes a hostname for this browser instance from your allow list. Return value: void $browser.deleteHostnamesFromWhitelist(hostnameArr: [string]) Removes all hostnames in the argument from your allow list for this browser instance. Return value: void $browser.executeAsyncScript(script: ?, var_args: ?) Schedules a command to execute asynchronous JavaScript in the context of the currently selected frame or window. Return value: promise $browser.executeScript(script: ?, var_args: ?) Schedules a command to execute JavaScript in the context of the currently selected frame or window. Return value: promise $browser.findElement(locator: $driver.Locator) Schedule a command to find an element on the page. If not found, synthetic monitoring returns an error. Return value: WebElementPromise $browser.findElements(locator: $driver.Locator) Schedule a command to search for multiple elements on the page. Return value: promise $browser.waitForAndFindElement(locator: $driver.Locator [, timeout: number) Schedule a command to wait for and find an element on the page, and another command to wait for it to be visible. If not found, synthetic monitoring returns an error. The timeout value is optional. It is applied separately to both tasks of finding the element and waiting for its visibility. This means at worst case, this method can take up to twice the provided timeout value. The default timeout value is 1000 ms (1 second). Return value: WebElementPromise $browser.get(url: string) Loads a webpage in a synthetic browser. Return value: promise $browser.getAllWindowHandles() Schedules a command to retrieve the current list of available window handles. Return value: promise $browser.getCapabilities() A promise that will resolve with the instance's capabilities. Return value: promise $browser.getCurrentUrl() Schedules a command to retrieve the URL of the current page. Return value: promise $browser.getHeaders() Returns a map of currently configured headers. Return value: map $browser.getPageSource() Schedules a command to retrieve the current page's source. The page source returned is a representation of the underlying DOM. Do not expect it to be formatted or escaped in the same way as the response sent from the web server. Return value: promise $browser.getSession() A promise for this client's session. Return value: promise $browser.getTitle() Schedules a command to retrieve the current page's title. Return value: promise $browser.getWindowHandle() Schedules a command to retrieve the current window handle. Return value: promise $browser.manage() The options interface for this instance. You can manage cookies, timeouts, and other window options. Return value: void $browser.navigate() The navigation interface (history of browser functions) for this instance. Return value: void $browser.schedule(command: ?, description: string) Schedules a command to be executed by this driver's CommandExecutor. Return value: promise $browser.sleep() Schedules a command to make the driver sleep for the given amount of time.

Return value: WebElement $browser.waitForPendingRequests(timeout: number) Causes the script to wait for requests that have been initiated to return, up to the timeout. Useful for tracking non-blocking resources. Return value: promise Deny list: Wildcard use If you want to add domains to the deny list for your browser instance, the wildcards must match the URL syntax of the URL to be blocked. An overall .com deny list must contain these functions: Function Blocking action $browser.addHostnameToBlacklist('*.com'); a.com $browser.addHostnameToBlacklist('*.*.com'); a.b.com $browser.addHostnameToBlacklist('*.*.*.com'); a.b.c.com $browser.addHostnameToBlacklist('www.*.com'); www.a.com $browser.addHostnameToBlacklist('www.*.*.com'); www.a.b.com $browser.addHostnameToBlacklist('www.*.*.*.com'); www.a.b.c.com Options: Manage the browser instance These functions manage options for your browser instance, such as cookies, timeouts, and window size. Access these options through the $browser.manage() function. Function Description $browser.manage().addCookie(spec: object) Schedules a command to add a cookie. spec is a record object describing a browser cookie. For more information, see the Selenium documentation. Return value: promise $browser.manage().deleteAllCookies() Schedules a command to delete all cookies visible to the current page. Return value: promise $browser.manage().deleteCookie(name: string) Schedules a command to delete the cookie with the given name. This command is a no-op if there is no cookie with the given name visible to the current page. Return value: promise $browser.manage().getCookie(name: string) Schedules a command to retrieve the cookie with the given name. Returns null if there is no such cookie. The cookie will be returned as a JSON object as described by the WebDriver wire protocol. Return value: promise $browser.manage().getCookies() Schedules a command to retrieve all cookies visible to the current page. New Relic Syntheticcs returns each cookie as a JSON object as described by the WebDriver wire protocol. Return value: promise $browser.manage().timeouts().implicitlyWait(ms: number) Specifies the amount of time the driver should wait when searching for an element if it is not immediately present. Setting the wait timeout to 0 disables implicit waiting. Be careful increasing the wait timeout, as it will increase test run time, especially with slower location strategies like XPath. Default is 10 seconds. Return value: promise $browser.manage().timeouts().pageLoadTimeout(ms: number) Sets the amount of time to wait for a page load to complete before returning an error. If the timeout is negative, page loads may last up to 180 seconds. Default is 60 seconds. Return value: promise $browser.manage().timeouts().setScriptTimeout(ms: number) Sets the amount of time to wait, in milliseconds, for an asynchronous script to finish execution before returning an error. Default is 30 seconds. Return value: promise $browser.manage().window().getPosition() Retrieves the window's current position, relative to the top left corner of the screen. Return value: promise $browser.manage().window().getSize() Retrieves the window's current size. Return value: promise $browser.manage().window().maximize() Maximizes the current window. Return value: promise $browser.manage().window().setPosition(x: number, y: number) Repositions the current window. Return value: promise $browser.manage().window().setSize(width: number, height: number) Resizes the current window. Return value: promise Locators: Find page elements Locators are a collection of factory functions for creating locator instances. Locators find DOM elements, which can be passed to functions such as $browser.findElement. Call them through $driver.By. Function Description $driver.By.className(className: string) Locates an element that has a specific class name. The returned locator is equivalent to searching for elements with the CSS selector .clazz. Return value: locator $driver.By.css(cssName: string) Locates an element using a CSS selector. Return value: locator $driver.By.id(id: string) Locates an element by its ID. Return value: locator $driver.By.linkText(linkText: string) Locates link elements whose visible text matches the given string. Return value: locator $driver.By.js(js: string) Locates an element by evaluating a JavaScript expression. Return value: locator $driver.By.name(name: string) Locates elements whose name attribute has the given value. Return value: locator $driver.By.partialLinkText(partialLinkText: string) Locates link elements whose getText visible contains the given substring. Return value: locator $driver.By.tagName(tagName: string) Locates elements with a given tag name. The returned locator is equivalent to using the getElementsByTagName DOM function. Return value: locator $driver.By.xpath(xpath: string) Locates elements matching a XPath selector. Return value: locator WebElement: Interact with page elements When a function such as $browser.findElement or $browser.waitForAndFindElement returns a WebElement reference, these functions can be used to interact with that element. For example, you can click on buttons, sent text to form inputs, and get attributes of elements to test. Function Description click() Clicks on this element. Return value: self reference sendKeys(var_args: ?) Schedules a command to type a sequence on the DOM element represented by this instance. Return value: WebElement getTagName() Schedules a command to query for the tag/node name of this element. Return value: WebElement getCssValue(name: string) Schedules a command to query for the computed style of the element represented by this instance. If the element inherits the named style from its parent, the parent will be queried for its value. Where possible, color values will be converted to their hex representation (for example, #00ff00 instead of rgb(0, 255, 0)). Return value: promise getAttribute(name: string) Schedules a command to query for the value of the given attribute of the element. Return value: promise getText(name: string) Get the visible (not hidden by CSS) innerText of this element, including sub-elements, without any leading or trailing white space. Return value: promise getSize() Schedules a command to compute the size of this element's bounding box, in pixels. Return value: promise getLocation() Schedules a command to compute the location of this element, in page space. Return value: promise isEnabled() Schedules a command to query whether the DOM element represented by this instance is enabled, as dictated by the disabled attribute. Return value: promise isSelected() Schedules a command to query whether this element is selected. Return value: promise submit() Schedules a command to submit the form containing this element (or this element if it is a FORM element). This command is a no-op if the element is not contained in a form. Return value: promise clear() Schedules a command to clear the value of this element. Return value: promise isDisplayed() Schedules a command to test whether this element is currently displayed. Return value: promise ActionSequence: Link multiple actions Action sequences can create complex user interactions with your website. To create a new action sequence, use $browser.actions(). To link multiple actions together into a sequence, include perform() after each. This executes and then terminates individual sequences, including single-action sequences. The following table contains a list of available actions. For more information, see the WebDriver ActionSequence documentation on GitHub. Function Description click(opt_elementOrButton: ?, opt_button: ?) Clicks a mouse button. If an element is provided, the mouse will first be moved to the center of that element. This is equivalent to WebElement.click(). Return value: actionsequence doubleClick(opt_elementOrButton: ?, opt_button: ?) Double-clicks a mouse button. If an element is provided, the mouse will first be moved to the center of that element. Return value: actionsequence dragAndDrop(element: ?, location: ?) Convenience function for performing a drag and drop maneuver. The target element may be moved to the location of another element, or by an offset (in pixels). The location is an object with two properties x and y: {x: x_offset, y: y_offset}. Return value: actionsequence keyDown(key: ?) Performs a modifier key press. Must be one of ALT, CONTROL, SHIFT, COMMAND, or META. The modifier key is not released until keyUp() or sendKeys() is called. The key press will be targeted at the currently focused element. Return value: actionsequence keyUp(key: ?) Performs a modifier key release. The release is targeted at the currently focused element. Return value: actionsequence mouseDown(opt_elementOrButton: ?, opt_button: ?) Presses a mouse button. The mouse button will not be released until mouseUp is called, regardless of whether that call is made in this sequence or another. The behavior for out-of-order events (such as calling mouseDown() or click() when the button is already held down) is undefined. Return value: actionsequence mouseUp(opt_elementOrButton: ?, opt_button: ?) Releases a mouse button. Behavior is undefined for calling this function without a previous call to mouseDown(). Return value: actionsequence mouseMove(location: ?, offset: ?) Moves the mouse. The location to move to may be specified in terms of the mouse's current location, an offset relative to the top-left corner of an element, or an element (in which case the middle of the element is used). Return value: actionsequence perform() Executes this action sequence. Return value: promise sendKeys(args: ?) Simulates typing multiple keys. Each modifier key encountered in the sequence will not be released until it is encountered again. All key events will be targeted at the currently focused element. For a full list of supported non-alphanumeric keys, see the WebDriver enum key documentation on GitHub. Return value: actionsequence Promises: Link actions into sequences You can also execute functions directly on promises. Synthetic monitoring is a native Node.js environment and uses standard Node.js promises. These functions evaluate the status of promises, cancel them, and more. In particular, you can create sequences of actions with the then() function and its siblings, finally() and catch(). For more information, see Sequence actions. Function Description isPending() Whether this promise's value is still being computed. Return value: boolean then(opt_callback: fn(T: ?), opt_errback: fn()) Registers listeners for when this instance is resolved. This is the basic function used to link synchronous actions in your script. Return value: promise finally(callback: fn()) Registers a listener to invoke when this promise is resolved, regardless of whether the promise's value was successfully computed. Return value: promise catch(callback: fn()) Registers a listener for when this promise is rejected. Return value: promise Navigate: Move through browser history The $browser.navigate() function exposes a number of functions that allow you to move backwards and forwards through your browser history, refresh your page and navigate to new pages. Function Description back() Move back by one step in the browser's history. Return value: void forward() Move forward by one step in the browser's history. Return value: void refresh() Refresh the current page. Return value: void to(string: url) Load a new webpage in the current browser window. $browser.navigate().to() is equivalent to $browser.get(). Return value: void Conditions: Pause and wait for conditions Tip You can learn more about waits in Selenium here. Used with $browser.wait, until pauses your script execution until the condition is matched. For more information, see Selenium's WebDriver until documentation. The following are available functions for $driver.until.Condition: Function Description ableToSwitchToFrame(frame: ?) Creates a condition that will wait until the input driver is able to switch to the designated frame. The target frame may be specified as: A numeric index into window.frames for the current frame A webdriver.WebElement, which must reference a FRAME or IFRAME element on the current page A locator which may be used to first locate a FRAME or IFRAME on the current page before attempting to switch to it Upon successful resolution of this condition, the driver will be left focused on the new frame. Return value: condition alertIsPresent() Creates a condition that waits for an alert to be opened. Upon success, the returned promise will be fulfilled with the handle for the opened alert. Return value: condition elementIsDisabled(element: $driver.WebElement) Creates a condition that will wait for the given element to be disabled. Return value: condition elementIsEnabled(element: $driver.WebElement) Creates a condition that will wait for the given element to be enabled. Return value: condition elementIsNotVisible(element: $driver.WebElement) Creates a condition that will wait for the given element to be in the DOM, yet not visible to the user. Return value: condition elementIsVisible(element: $driver.WebElement) Creates a condition that will wait for the given element to become visible. Return value: condition elementIsSelected(element: $driver.WebElement) Creates a condition that will wait for the given element to be selected. Return value: condition elementLocated(element: $driver.Locator) Creates a condition that will loop until an element is found with the given locator. Return value: condition elementsLocated(element: $driver.Locator) Creates a condition that will loop until at least one element is found with the given locator. Return value: condition n elementTextContains(element: $driver.WebElement, substr: string) Creates a condition that will wait for the given element's visible text to contain the given substring. Return value: condition elementTextIs(element: $driver.WebElement, text: string) Case sensitive. Creates a condition that will wait for the given element's visible text to match the given text exactly. Return value: condition n elementTextMatches(element: $driver.WebElement, regex: string) Creates a condition that will wait for the given element's visible text to match a regular expression. Return value: condition stalenessOf(element: $driver.WebElement) Creates a condition that will wait for the given element to become stale. An element is considered stale once it is removed from the DOM or a new page has loaded. Return value: condition titleContains(substr: string) Creates a condition that will wait for the current page's title to contain the given substring. Return value: condition titleIs(title: string) Creates a condition that will wait for the current page's title to match the given value. Return value: condition titleMatches(regex: string) Creates a condition that will wait for the current page's title to match the given regular expression. Return value: condition",

      "body": "Read on to learn about synthetic monitoring's proxy settings and properties. Proxy settings API for scripted monitors Important You can set proxy server configuration for synthetic scripted monitors for monitor versions 0.4.0 or higher. The global object $network allows you to control the network configuration used by your synthetic scripted monitors. The following are applicable for both scripted browsers and API tests, unless otherwise stated. $network.setProxy(string or object PROXY URL) Sets a proxy server to be used for all per-URL requests (HTTP, HTTPS, and FTP). Additional notes: The port is optional. If not provided, it will be derived from the scheme. For example, for HTTP the port would be 80. The username and password are assumed to be the result of a call to encodeURIComponent(). Special characters like @ and : in the username and/or the password must be escaped. Returns This method returns a Promise that will resolve once the configuration has been applied. Parameters Parameter Data Type Description proxyURL | proxyUrlParsed String or Object The URL to connect to the proxy server. A string containing a proxyURL (for example, http://proxy_host:8888) or a plain object in the same format as defined by Node's url.parse(urlString) method. Examples An example of setting a proxy server with HTTP protocol on port 1234 with no authentication: $network.setProxy('http://host.com:1234') Copy An example of setting a proxy server with HTTP protocol with authentication credentials. $network.setProxy('http://proxyUsername:proxyPassword@proxyHost:1234') Copy $network.setProxyForHttp(string or object PROXY URL) Tip This call is exactly the same as the per-URL setProxy call, except that it applies to HTTP traffic. Sets a proxy server to be used for all HTTP requests. Additional notes: The port is optional. If not provided, it will be derived from the scheme. For example, for HTTP the port would be 80. The username and password are assumed to be the result of a call to encodeURIComponent(). Special characters like @ and : in the username and/or the password must be escaped. Returns This method returns a Promise that will resolve once the configuration has been applied. Parameters Parameter Data Type Description proxyURL | proxyUrlParsed String or Object The URL to connect to the proxy server. A string containing a proxyURL (for example, http://proxy_host:8888) or a plain object in the same format as defined by Node's url.parse(urlString) method. Examples An example of setting a proxy server with HTTP protocol on port 1234 with no authentication: $network.setProxyForHttp('http://host.com:1234') Copy An example of setting a proxy server with HTTP protocol with authentication credentials. $network.setProxyForHttp('http://proxyUsername:proxyPassword@proxyHost:1234') Copy $network.setProxyForHttps(string or object PROXY URL) Tip This call is exactly the same as the per-URL setProxy call, except that it applies to HTTPS traffic. Sets a proxy server to be used for all HTTPS requests. Additional notes: The port is optional. If not provided, it will be derived from the scheme. For example, for HTTP the default port would be 443. The username and password are assumed to be the result of a call to encodeURIComponent(). Special characters like @ and : in the username and/or the password must be escaped. Returns This method returns a Promise that will resolve once the configuration has been applied. Parameters Parameter Data Type Description proxyURL | proxyUrlParsed String or Object The URL to connect to the proxy server. A string containing a proxyURL (for example, http://proxy_host:8888) or a plain object in the same format as defined by Node's url.parse(urlString) method. Examples An example of setting a proxy server with HTTPS protocol on port 1234 with no authentication: $network.setProxyForHttps('https://host.com:1234') Copy An example of setting a proxy server with HTTPS protocol with authentication credentials. $network.setProxyForHttps('https://proxyUsername:proxyPassword@proxyHost:1234') Copy $network.setProxyPAC(string PAC SCRIPT URL, object AUTH OBJECT) Sets a proxy server via a proxy auto-config (PAC) script and returns a promise. This function is only available for scripted browser monitors. Returns This method returns a Promise that will resolve once the configuration has been applied. Parameters Parameter Data Type Description scriptURL String The URL of the PAC script. authCredentialsMap Object Map of authentication credentials to be provided to the proxy server(s), keyed by the hostnames of the proxy server. Values of this map must be defined in the format {username: 'authUsername', password: 'authPassword'} Examples An example of setting a proxy server via a proxy auto-config (PAC) script: var authCredentialsMap = { 'example.com': {username: 'authUsername', password: 'authPassword'}, } Copy Here's an example of setting up a proxied network via proxy auto-config (PAC) script: var authCredentialsMap = { 'example.com': {username: 'authUsername', password: 'authPassword'}, 'anotherExample.com': {username: 'authUsername', password: 'authPassword'}, } $network.setProxyPAC(\"https://www.example.com/pacScript\", authCredentialsMap) Copy $network.setProxyAdvanced(object PROXY RULES OBJECT) Tip This method is Chrome-specific: it only applies to scripted browser monitor types. It can be used to allow for a more flexible and complex proxy configuration. In most cases, this method will not be needed. Sets the proxy configuration using the format supported by Chrome Extension API for Proxying. The input is a ProxyRules object, as defined by the Chrome Extension API to configures proxies. You can add authCredentials for proxies that need it. See Parameters for more details. Returns This method returns a Promise that will resolve once the configuration has been applied. Parameters Parameter Data Type Description ProxyRules Object Object The proxyRulesObject is a plain object that follows the format ProxyRules as defined by the Chrome Extension API to configures proxies. This object is \"flavoured\" to fit our runtime: users can define an additional property, authCredentials, for the Proxy server objects to provide authentication credentials for a specific proxy server. authCredentials is an object in the format {username: 'authUsername', password: 'authPassword'}. Examples Here's an example of creating a proxyRules with authCredentials: var proxyRules = { singleProxy: { host:\"example.com\", authCredentials: { username: 'authUsername', password: 'authPassword' } } }; Copy Here's an example of setting up a proxied network with mixed network zone assets: var proxyRules = {singleProxy: {host:\"http://entproxy.mycompany.com\"}, bypassList:['s3.amazonaws.com','*.localcdn.com'] } $network.setProxyAdvanced(proxyRules) Copy $network.clearProxy() Clears/removes the current proxy configuration. Returns This method returns a Promise that will resolve once the configuration has been applied. $network.getProxy() This method returns the current proxy configuration. It must be synchronized in a promise callback. Examples An example of synchronizing getProxy with $network.setProxy(); and $network.clearProxy();: var assert = require('assert'); $network.setProxy(\"http://user:password@myproxyurl.com\") .then(function () { console.log('Proxy configuration applied'); //Note: $network.getProxy() is not synchronized with the webdriver Control Flow. //To make sure we get the proxy configuration after the call to setProxy() above // succeeds we need to use a promise callback var proxyData = $network.getProxy(); console.log(proxyData); }) .then(function () { // Again: getProxy() is not synchronized with the Webdriver Control Flow: we //need this promise callback otherwise clearProxy() might be called before the call // to getProxy() above returns return $network.clearProxy(); }) .then(function () { console.log('Proxy configuration cleared'); // We need this promise callback for reasons explained above var proxyData = $network.getProxy(); assert.equal(proxyData.rules, null); }); Copy Proxy properties Important This proxy information applies only to these versions: API monitors: 0.4.0, 0.2.2, 0.2.1, 0.1.0 Scripted monitors: 0.1.0 In order to analyze and collect your HTTP traffic metrics, New Relic must ensure the traffic passes through a conceptual funnel. Our synthetic monitoring includes a software funnel component capable of analyzing the HTTP requests or responses and then recording the information. New Relic's scripted browser monitors (versions 0.4.x and lower) include a mechanism to do this analysis without needing an HTTP proxy, so you don't have to configure anything. New Relic's API test (versions 0.4.x and lower) provides an $http object that is pre-configured to make the requests pass through the internal HTTP proxy. This allows you to write your test without including any proxy settings. If you want to use some other way to generate HTTP traffic while still collecting the HTTP traffic metrics, you can use $env.PROXY_HOST and $env.PROXY_PORT. To record traffic metrics, be sure to include these properties in your script.",

      "body": "Use synthetic monitoring's API tests to monitor your API endpoint to ensure it is functioning correctly. New Relic uses the http-request module internally to make HTTP calls to your endpoint and validate the results. Here we present some example functions showing how to use the $http object to submit your request. For detailed documentation on the options available for this object, see the http-request readme. (Note that Request is deprecated, but these options still apply.) Tip To view and share other API test examples, visit the synthetics scripts section in Explorers Hub. Use API http-request module API tests are powered by the http-request module, which is available through the $http object. Once each frequency interval, New Relic queries your endpoint from each of your selected locations. For instructions on creating a monitor, see Adding monitors. Read on to learn how to define metadata for your request, make a GET request, make a POST request, and how to validate the results. Important After a maximum run time of three minutes, New Relic manually stops the script. one.newrelic.com > Synthetics > Create monitor: The script editor suggests functions, selectors, and other elements to simplify scripting commands (available in GitHub). Configure request options To start your script: Declare a variable (such as options) to store your request options object. Define request options such as the URL endpoint, and custom headers. If you're setting SSL or agent options, see SSL and agentOptions requirements. We recommend using SSL to avoid exposing plain text credentials in your headers. Tip For a full list of supported request options, see request(options, callback) in the http-request documentation on GitHub. Here's an example of optional metadata in the options object: Using optional metadata //Declare optional metadata var options = { //Specify the endpoint URL url: 'https://api-endpoint.example.com', //Specify optional headers headers: { 'Endpoint-Key': 'uqNTC57Phe72pnnB8JuJmwAr7b09nKSKSz', 'Additional-Header': 'Additional-Header-Data' } }; Copy For SSL and agentOptions: If you are setting SSL options or providing an agentOptions object, the agent property in the request options object will need to be set to $globalAgents.https or $globalAgents.http to ensure your HTTP requests use the instrumented global agent. Here's an example of using a SSL option or agentOptions: Using a SSL option or agentOptions This example uses agentOptions: //Declare optional metadata var options = { //Specify the endpoint URL url: 'https://api-endpoint.example.com', //Specify optional headers headers: { 'Endpoint-Key': 'uqNTC57Phe72pnnB8JuJmwAr7b09nKSKSz', 'Additional-Header': 'Additional-Header-Data' } //Specify global agent as the http agent agent: $globalAgents.https, //Set SSL option strictSSL: true, //Specify http agent options agentOptions: { ​maxVersion: 'TLSv1.1' }, }; Copy Send a GET request To make a GET request, use the $http.get method to submit your request. Define your request options, make your request using $http.get, then validate the response to ensure your endpoint is returning the correct results. Insights GET example This example queries the Insights API by using GET: //Define your authentication credentials var myAccountID = '{YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID}'; var myQueryKey = '{YOUR_QUERY_KEY}'; var options = { //Define endpoint URI uri: 'https://insights-api.newrelic.com/v1/accounts/'+myAccountID+'/query?nrql=SELECT%20average(duration)%20FROM%20Transaction', //Define query key and expected data type. headers: { 'X-Query-Key': myQueryKey, 'Accept': 'application/json' } }; //Define expected results using callback function. function callback (err, response, body){ //Log JSON results from endpoint to Synthetics console. console.log(JSON.parse(body)); console.log('done with script'); } //Make GET request, passing in options and callback. $http.get(options,callback); Copy Send a POST request To make a POST request, use the $http.post method to submit your request. Define your request options, make your request using $http.post, then validate the response to ensure your endpoint is returning the correct results. Custom event POST example This example POSTs a custom event containing static integers to the Event API: //Define your authentication credentials. var myAccountID = '{YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID}'; var myLicenseKey = '{YOUR_LICENSE_KEY}'; //Import the 'assert' module to validate results. var assert = require('assert'); var options = { //Define endpoint URL. url: \"https://insights-collector.newrelic.com/v1/accounts/\"+myAccountID+\"/events\", //Define body of POST request. body: '[{\"eventType\":\"SyntheticsEvent\",\"integer1\":1000,\"integer2\":2000}]', //Define New Relic license key and expected data type. headers: { 'Api-Key': myLicenseKey, 'Content-Type': 'application/json' } }; //Define expected results using callback function. function callback(error, response, body) { //Log status code to Synthetics console. console.log(response.statusCode + \" status code\") //Verify endpoint returns 200 (OK) response code. assert.ok(response.statusCode == 200, 'Expected 200 OK response'); //Parse JSON received from Insights into variable. var info = JSON.parse(body); //Verify that `info` contains element named `success` with a value of `true`. assert.ok(info.success == true, 'Expected True results in Response Body, result was ' + info.success); //Log end of script. console.log(\"End reached\"); } //Make POST request, passing in options and callback. $http.post(options, callback); Copy Validate results To validate your results, import the assert module to define your test case. Call an assert method to validate your endpoint's response. If any assert functions fail, the entire monitor will be considered a failed check. This may trigger alert notifications and affect your metrics. Important Synthetic monitoring does not allow thrown exceptions. Thrown exceptions result in script failure. Use the assert module to validate your results, and use console.log() to log results to the synthetic's console. Event API validation example This example POSTs to the Event API, then validates that the response is {\"success\":true}: //Define your authentication credentials. var myAccountID = '{YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID}'; var myLicenseKey = '{YOUR_LICENSE_KEY}'; //Import the `assert` module to validate results. var assert = require('assert'); var options = { //Define endpoint URL. url: \"https://insights-collector.newrelic.com/v1/accounts/\"+myAccountID+\"/events\", //Define body of POST request. body: '[{\"eventType\":\"SyntheticsEvent\",\"integer1\":1000,\"integer2\":2000}]', //Define New Relic license key and expected data type. headers: { 'Api-Key': myLicenseKey, 'Content-Type': 'application/json' } }; $http.post(options, function(error, response, body) { //Log status code to Synthetics console. The status code is logged before the `assert` function, //because a failed assert function ends the script. console.log(response.statusCode + \" status code\") //Call `assert` method, expecting a `200` response code. //If assertion fails, log `Expected 200 OK response` as error message to Synthetics console. assert.ok(response.statusCode == 200, 'Expected 200 OK response'); var info = JSON.parse(body); //Call `assert` method, expecting body to return `{\"success\":true}`. //If assertion fails, log `Expected True results in Response Body,` plus results as error message to Synthetics console. assert.ok(info.success == true, 'Expected True results in Response Body, result was ' + info.success); }); Copy",

      "body": "This document is for synthetic monitor versions 0.4.x or lower. See also the documentation for Synthetic monitor versions 0.5 or higher. Overview Synthetic scripted browsers provide you access to the Selenium Webdriver APIs 2.47.0 via the variables $driver and $browser. In particular: $driver provides all the exports from the selenium-webdriver module (for example, ActionSequence, Button, By, WebElement, etc.). $browser is a synthetic-flavored instance of selenium-webdriver.WebDriver(): it exposes the main basic WebDriver APIs like get() and findElement(), as well as some synthetic custom APIs. This document describes the functions available for synthetic scripted browser monitors version 0.4.0 or lower. For the newest monitor documentation, see monitor version 0.5.0+ documentation. Other relevant documentation: For more on synthetic scripting, see Write scripted browsers. For example scripts, see Scripted browser examples. For more information about monitor versions and runtime differences, see Runtime environments. To view and share scripted browser examples, check out topics tagged synthetic-script in New Relic's Explorers Hub. Top-level functions: Build your script New Relic calls top-level functions directly from your $browser instance. These provide a wide range of functionality that covers many basic scriptable actions. Function Return value $browser.actions() Creates a new action sequence using this driver. For a list of available actions, see ActionSequence: Link multiple actions. void $browser.addHeader(headerKey: string, headerValue: string) Adds header headerKey with value headerValue to the runtime. void $browser.addHeaders(headers: ?) Adds a map of headers to the runtime. void $browser.deleteHeader(header: string) Deletes a specific header from the runtime. void $browser.deleteHeaders(header: [string]) Deletes all headers in argument from runtime. void $browser.addHostnameToBlacklist(hostname: string) Disallows a hostname. Allows use wildcards. void $browser.addHostnamesToBlacklist(hostnameArr: [string]) Disallows all hostnames in an array of arguments. Allows use wildcards. void $browser.addHostnameToWhitelist(hostname: string) Allows a hostname blocked by default in synthetic monitoring. void $browser.addHostnamesToWhitelist(hostnameArr: [string]) Allows all hostnames in argument. void $browser.deleteHostnameFromBlacklist(hostname: string) Removes a hostname from this browser instance's blacklist. void $browser.deleteHostnamesFromBlacklist(hostnameArr: [string]) Removes all hostnames in argument from the disallowed list. void $browser.deleteHostnameFromWhitelist(hostnameArr: [string]) Removes a hostname from this browser instance's allowed list. void $browser.deleteHostnamesFromWhitelist(hostnameArr: [string]) Removes all hostnames in argument from this browser instance's allowed list. void $browser.executeAsyncScript(script: ?, var_args: ?) Schedules a command to execute asynchronous JavaScript in the context of the currently selected frame or window. promise $browser.executeScript(script: ?, var_args: ?) Schedules a command to execute JavaScript in the context of the currently selected frame or window. promise $browser.findElement(locator: $driver.Locator) Schedule a command to find an element on the page. If not found, New Relic returns an error. WebElement $browser.findElements(locator: $driver.Locator) Schedule a command to search for multiple elements on the page. promise $browser.waitForAndFindElement(locator: $driver.Locator [, timeout: number) Schedule a command to wait for and find an element on the page, and another command to wait for it to be visible. If not found, New Relic returns an error. The timeout value is an optional one, and gets applied separately to both tasks of finding the element and waiting for its visibility. This means at worst case, this method can take up to twice the provided timeout value. The default timeout value is 1000 ms (1 second). promise $browser.get(url: string) Loads a webpage in a synthetic browser. promise $browser.getAllWindowHandles() Schedules a command to retrieve the current list of available window handles. promise $browser.getCapabilities() A promise that will resolve with the instance's capabilities. promise $browser.getCurrentUrl() Schedules a command to retrieve the URL of the current page. promise $browser.getHeaders() Returns a map of currently configured headers. map $browser.getPageSource() Schedules a command to retrieve the current page's source. The page source returned is a representation of the underlying DOM; do not expect it to be formatted or escaped in the same way as the response sent from the web server. promise $browser.getSession() A promise for this client's session. promise $browser.getTitle() Schedules a command to retrieve the current page's title. promise $browser.getWindowHandle() Schedules a command to retrieve the current window handle. promise $browser.isElementPresent(locatorOrElement: $driver.Locator) Schedules a command to test if an element is present on the page. If given a DOM element, this function will check if it belongs to the document the driver is currently focused on. Otherwise, the function will test if at least one element can be found with the given search criteria. promise $browser.manage() The options interface for this instance. You can manage cookies, timeouts, and other window options. void $browser.navigate() The navigation interface (history of browser functions) for this instance. void $browser.schedule(command: ?, description: string) Schedules a command to be executed by this driver's CommandExecutor. promise $browser.sleep() Schedules a command to make the driver sleep for the given amount of time. promise $browser.switchTo() The target locator interface for this instance. void $browser.takeScreenshot() Schedule a command to take a screenshot. promise $browser.wait(fn: $driver.until.Condition, timeout: number, opt_message: string) Schedules a command to wait for a condition to hold, as defined by some user supplied function. webElement $browser.waitForPendingRequests(timeout: number) Causes the script to wait for requests that have been initiated to return, up to the timeout. Useful for tracking non-blocking resources. promise Disallow list: Wildcard use Disallowing domains for your browser instance requires wildcards to match the URL syntax of the URL to be blocked. An overall .com disallowed list needs to contain these functions: Function Blocking action $browser.addHostnameToBlacklist('*.com'); a.com $browser.addHostnameToBlacklist('*.*.com'); a.b.com $browser.addHostnameToBlacklist('*.*.*.com'); a.b.c.com $browser.addHostnameToBlacklist('www.*.com'); www.a.com $browser.addHostnameToBlacklist('www.*.*.com'); www.a.b.com $browser.addHostnameToBlacklist('www.*.*.*.com'); www.a.b.c.com Options: Manage the browser instance These functions manage options for your browser instance such as cookies, timeouts and window size. Access these options through the $browser.manage() function. Function Return value $browser.manage().addCookie(name: string, value: string, opt_path: string, opt_domain: string, opt_isSecure: boolean, opt_expiry: number) Schedules a command to add a cookie. promise $browser.manage().deleteAllCookies() Schedules a command to delete all cookies visible to the current page. promise $browser.manage().deleteCookie(name: string) Schedules a command to delete the cookie with the given name. This command is a no-op if there is no cookie with the given name visible to the current page. promise $browser.manage().getCookie(name: string) Schedules a command to retrieve the cookie with the given name. Returns null if there is no such cookie. The cookie will be returned as a JSON object as described by the WebDriver wire protocol. promise $browser.manage().getCookies() Schedules a command to retrieve all cookies visible to the current page. New Relic Syntheticcs returns each cookie as a JSON object as described by the WebDriver wire protocol. promise $browser.manage().timeouts().implicitlyWait(ms: number) Specifies the amount of time the driver should wait when searching for an element if it is not immediately present. Setting the wait timeout to 0 disables implicit waiting. Be careful increasing the wait timeout, as it will increase test run time, especially with slower location strategies like XPath. Default is 10 seconds. promise $browser.manage().timeouts().pageLoadTimeout(ms: number) Sets the amount of time to wait for a page load to complete before returning an error. If the timeout is negative, page loads may last up to 180 seconds. Default is 60 seconds. promise $browser.manage().timeouts().setScriptTimeout(ms: number) Sets the amount of time to wait, in milliseconds, for an asynchronous script to finish execution before returning an error. Default is 30 seconds. promise $browser.manage().window().getPosition() Retrieves the window's current position, relative to the top left corner of the screen. promise $browser.manage().window().getSize() Retrieves the window's current size. promise $browser.manage().window().maximize() Maximizes the current window. promise $browser.manage().window().setPosition(x: number, y: number) Repositions the current window. promise $browser.manage().window().setSize(width: number, height: number) Resizes the current window. promise Locators: Find page elements Locators are a collection of factory functions for creating locator instances. Locators find DOM elements, which can be passed to functions such as $browser.findElement or $browser.isElementPresent. Call them through $driver.By. Function Return value $driver.By.className(className: string) Locates an element that has a specific class name. The returned locator is equivalent to searching for elements with the CSS selector .clazz. locator $driver.By.css(cssName: string) Locates an element using a CSS selector. locator $driver.By.id(id: string) Locates an element by its ID. locator $driver.By.linkText(linkText: string) Locates link elements whose visible text matches the given string. locator $driver.By.js(js: string) Locates an element by evaluating a JavaScript expression. locator $driver.By.name(name: string) Locates elements whose name attribute has the given value. locator $driver.By.partialLinkText(partialLinkText: string) Locates link elements whose getText visible contains the given substring. locator $driver.By.tagName(tagName: string) Locates elements with a given tag name. The returned locator is equivalent to using the getElementsByTagName DOM function. locator $driver.By.xpath(xpath: string) Locates elements matching a XPath selector. locator WebElement: Interact with page elements When a function such as $browser.findElement or $browser.waitForAndFindElement returns a WebElement reference, these functions can be used to interact with that element. Using these, you can click on buttons, sent text to form inputs, and get attributes of elements to test. Function Return value click() Clicks on this element. void sendKeys(var_args: ?) Schedules a command to type a sequence on the DOM element represented by this instance. WebElement getTagName() Schedules a command to query for the tag/node name of this element. WebElement getCssValue(name: string) Schedules a command to query for the computed style of the element represented by this instance. If the element inherits the named style from its parent, the parent will be queried for its value. Where possible, color values will be converted to their hex representation (for example, #00ff00 instead of rgb(0, 255, 0)). promise getAttribute(name: string) Schedules a command to query for the value of the given attribute of the element. promise getText(name: string) Get the visible (not hidden by CSS) innerText of this element, including sub-elements, without any leading or trailing white space. promise getSize() Schedules a command to compute the size of this element's bounding box, in pixels. promise getLocation() Schedules a command to compute the location of this element, in page space. promise isEnabled() Schedules a command to query whether the DOM element represented by this instance is enabled, as dictated by the disabled attribute. promise isSelected() Schedules a command to query whether this element is selected. promise submit() Schedules a command to submit the form containing this element (or this element if it is a FORM element). This command is a no-op if the element is not contained in a form. promise clear() Schedules a command to clear the value of this element. promise isDisplayed() Schedules a command to test whether this element is currently displayed. promise getOuterHtml() Schedules a command to retrieve the outer HTML of this element. promise getInnerHtml() Schedules a command to retrieve the inner HTML of this element. promise ActionSequence: Link multiple actions Action sequences can create complex user interactions with your website. To create a new action sequence, use $browser.actions(). To link multiple actions together into a sequence, include perform() after each. This executes and then terminates individual sequences, including single-action sequences. The following table contains a list of available actions. For more information, see the WebDriver ActionSequence documentation. Function Return value click(opt_elementOrButton: ?, opt_button: ?) Clicks a mouse button. If an element is provided, the mouse will first be moved to the center of that element. This is equivalent to WebElement.click(). actionsequence doubleClick(opt_elementOrButton: ?, opt_button: ?) Double-clicks a mouse button. If an element is provided, the mouse will first be moved to the center of that element. actionsequence dragAndDrop(element: ?, location: ?) Convenience function for performing a \"drag and drop\" maneuver. The target element may be moved to the location of another element, or by an offset (in pixels). The location is an object with two properties x and y: {x: x_offset, y: y_offset}. actionsequence keyDown(key: ?) Performs a modifier key press. Must be one of ALT, CONTROL, SHIFT, COMMAND, or META. The modifier key is not released until keyUp() or sendKeys() is called. The key press will be targeted at the currently focused element. actionsequence keyUp(key: ?) Performs a modifier key release. The release is targeted at the currently focused element. actionsequence mouseDown(opt_elementOrButton: ?, opt_button: ?) Presses a mouse button. The mouse button will not be released until mouseUp is called, regardless of whether that call is made in this sequence or another. The behavior for out-of-order events (such as calling mouseDown() or click() when the button is already held down) is undefined. actionsequence mouseUp(opt_elementOrButton: ?, opt_button: ?) Releases a mouse button. Behavior is undefined for calling this function without a previous call to mouseDown(). actionsequence mouseMove(location: ?, offset: ?) Moves the mouse. The location to move to may be specified in terms of the mouse's current location, an offset relative to the top-left corner of an element, or an element (in which case the middle of the element is used). actionsequence perform() Executes this action sequence. promise sendKeys(args: ?) Simulates typing multiple keys. Each modifier key encountered in the sequence will not be released until it is encountered again. All key events will be targeted at the currently focused element. For a full list of supported non-alphanumeric keys, see the WebDriver enum key documentation. actionsequence Promises: Link actions into sequences You can also execute functions directly on promises. Synthetic monitoring is a native Node.js environment and uses standard Node.js promises. These functions evaluate the status of promises, cancel them, and more. In particular, you can create sequences of actions with the then() function and its siblings, thenFinally() and thenCatch(). For more information, see Sequence actions. Function Return value cancel(string: reason) Cancels the computation of this promise's value, rejecting the promise in the process. This method is a no-op if the promise has already been resolved. void isPending() Whether this promise's value is still being computed. boolean then(opt_callback: fn(T: ?), opt_errback: fn()) Registers listeners for when this instance is resolved. This is the basic function used to link synchronous actions in your script. promise thenFinally(callback: fn()) Registers a listener to invoke when this promise is resolved, regardless of whether the promise's value was successfully computed. promise thenCatch(callback: fn()) Registers a listener for when this promise is rejected. promise Navigate: Move through browser history The $browser.navigate() function exposes a number of functions that allow you to move backwards and forwards through your browser history, refresh your page and navigate to new pages. Function Return value back() Move back by one step in the browser's history. void forward() Move forward by one step in the browser's history. void refresh() Refresh the current page. void to(string: url) Load a new webpage in the current browser window. $browser.navigate().to() is equivalent to $browser.get(). void Conditions: Pause and wait for conditions Used with $browser.wait, until pauses your script execution until the condition is matched. For more information on explicit and implicit waits, see the WebDriver documentation. For .wait and .until usage examples, see Webdriver.wait examples. The following are available functions for $driver.until.Condition: Function Return value ableToSwitchToFrame(frame: ?) Creates a condition that will wait until the input driver is able to switch to the designated frame. The target frame may be specified as: A numeric index into window.frames for the current frame A webdriver.WebElement, which must reference a FRAME or IFRAME element on the current page A locator which may be used to first locate a FRAME or IFRAME on the current page before attempting to switch to it Upon successful resolution of this condition, the driver will be left focused on the new frame. condition alertIsPresent() Creates a condition that waits for an alert to be opened. Upon success, the returned promise will be fulfilled with the handle for the opened alert. condition elementIsDisabled(element: $driver.WebElement) Creates a condition that will wait for the given element to be disabled. condition elementIsEnabled(element: $driver.WebElement) Creates a condition that will wait for the given element to be enabled. condition elementIsNotVisible(element: $driver.WebElement) Creates a condition that will wait for the given element to be in the DOM, yet not visible to the user. condition elementIsVisible(element: $driver.WebElement) Creates a condition that will wait for the given element to become visible. condition elementIsSelected(element: $driver.WebElement) Creates a condition that will wait for the given element to be selected. condition elementLocated(element: $driver.Locator) Creates a condition that will loop until an element is found with the given locator. condition elementsLocated(element: $driver.Locator) Creates a condition that will loop until at least one element is found with the given locator. condition elementTextContains(element: $driver.WebElement, substr: string) Creates a condition that will wait for the given element's visible text to contain the given substring. condition elementTextIs(element: $driver.WebElement, text: string) Case sensitive. Creates a condition that will wait for the given element's visible text to match the given text exactly. condition elementTextMatches(element: $driver.WebElement, regex: string) Creates a condition that will wait for the given element's visible text to match a regular expression. condition stalenessOf(element: $driver.WebElement) Creates a condition that will wait for the given element to become stale. An element is considered stale once it is removed from the DOM, or a new page has loaded. condition titleContains(substr: string) Creates a condition that will wait for the current page's title to contain the given substring. condition titleIs(title: string) Creates a condition that will wait for the current page's title to match the given value. condition titleMatches(regex: string) Creates a condition that will wait for the current page's title to match the given regular expression. condition",

      "body": "Read on to learn about synthetic monitoring's proxy settings and properties. Proxy settings API for scripted monitors Important You can set proxy server configuration for synthetic scripted monitors for monitor versions 0.4.0 or higher. The global object $network allows you to control the network configuration used by your synthetic scripted monitors. The following are applicable for both scripted browsers and API tests, unless otherwise stated. $network.setProxy(string or object PROXY URL) Sets a proxy server to be used for all per-URL requests (HTTP, HTTPS, and FTP). Additional notes: The port is optional. If not provided, it will be derived from the scheme. For example, for HTTP the port would be 80. The username and password are assumed to be the result of a call to encodeURIComponent(). Special characters like @ and : in the username and/or the password must be escaped. Returns This method returns a Promise that will resolve once the configuration has been applied. Parameters Parameter Data Type Description proxyURL | proxyUrlParsed String or Object The URL to connect to the proxy server. A string containing a proxyURL (for example, http://proxy_host:8888) or a plain object in the same format as defined by Node's url.parse(urlString) method. Examples An example of setting a proxy server with HTTP protocol on port 1234 with no authentication: $network.setProxy('http://host.com:1234') Copy An example of setting a proxy server with HTTP protocol with authentication credentials. $network.setProxy('http://proxyUsername:proxyPassword@proxyHost:1234') Copy $network.setProxyForHttp(string or object PROXY URL) Tip This call is exactly the same as the per-URL setProxy call, except that it applies to HTTP traffic. Sets a proxy server to be used for all HTTP requests. Additional notes: The port is optional. If not provided, it will be derived from the scheme. For example, for HTTP the port would be 80. The username and password are assumed to be the result of a call to encodeURIComponent(). Special characters like @ and : in the username and/or the password must be escaped. Returns This method returns a Promise that will resolve once the configuration has been applied. Parameters Parameter Data Type Description proxyURL | proxyUrlParsed String or Object The URL to connect to the proxy server. A string containing a proxyURL (for example, http://proxy_host:8888) or a plain object in the same format as defined by Node's url.parse(urlString) method. Examples An example of setting a proxy server with HTTP protocol on port 1234 with no authentication: $network.setProxyForHttp('http://host.com:1234') Copy An example of setting a proxy server with HTTP protocol with authentication credentials. $network.setProxyForHttp('http://proxyUsername:proxyPassword@proxyHost:1234') Copy $network.setProxyForHttps(string or object PROXY URL) Tip This call is exactly the same as the per-URL setProxy call, except that it applies to HTTPS traffic. Sets a proxy server to be used for all HTTPS requests. Additional notes: The port is optional. If not provided, it will be derived from the scheme. For example, for HTTP the default port would be 443. The username and password are assumed to be the result of a call to encodeURIComponent(). Special characters like @ and : in the username and/or the password must be escaped. Returns This method returns a Promise that will resolve once the configuration has been applied. Parameters Parameter Data Type Description proxyURL | proxyUrlParsed String or Object The URL to connect to the proxy server. A string containing a proxyURL (for example, http://proxy_host:8888) or a plain object in the same format as defined by Node's url.parse(urlString) method. Examples An example of setting a proxy server with HTTPS protocol on port 1234 with no authentication: $network.setProxyForHttps('https://host.com:1234') Copy An example of setting a proxy server with HTTPS protocol with authentication credentials. $network.setProxyForHttps('https://proxyUsername:proxyPassword@proxyHost:1234') Copy $network.setProxyPAC(string PAC SCRIPT URL, object AUTH OBJECT) Sets a proxy server via a proxy auto-config (PAC) script and returns a promise. This function is only available for scripted browser monitors. Returns This method returns a Promise that will resolve once the configuration has been applied. Parameters Parameter Data Type Description scriptURL String The URL of the PAC script. authCredentialsMap Object Map of authentication credentials to be provided to the proxy server(s), keyed by the hostnames of the proxy server. Values of this map must be defined in the format {username: 'authUsername', password: 'authPassword'} Examples An example of setting a proxy server via a proxy auto-config (PAC) script: var authCredentialsMap = { 'example.com': {username: 'authUsername', password: 'authPassword'}, } Copy Here's an example of setting up a proxied network via proxy auto-config (PAC) script: var authCredentialsMap = { 'example.com': {username: 'authUsername', password: 'authPassword'}, 'anotherExample.com': {username: 'authUsername', password: 'authPassword'}, } $network.setProxyPAC(\"https://www.example.com/pacScript\", authCredentialsMap) Copy $network.setProxyAdvanced(object PROXY RULES OBJECT) Tip This method is Chrome-specific: it only applies to scripted browser monitor types. It can be used to allow for a more flexible and complex proxy configuration. In most cases, this method will not be needed. Sets the proxy configuration using the format supported by Chrome Extension API for Proxying. The input is a ProxyRules object, as defined by the Chrome Extension API to configures proxies. You can add authCredentials for proxies that need it. See Parameters for more details. Returns This method returns a Promise that will resolve once the configuration has been applied. Parameters Parameter Data Type Description ProxyRules Object Object The proxyRulesObject is a plain object that follows the format ProxyRules as defined by the Chrome Extension API to configures proxies. This object is \"flavoured\" to fit our runtime: users can define an additional property, authCredentials, for the Proxy server objects to provide authentication credentials for a specific proxy server. authCredentials is an object in the format {username: 'authUsername', password: 'authPassword'}. Examples Here's an example of creating a proxyRules with authCredentials: var proxyRules = { singleProxy: { host:\"example.com\", authCredentials: { username: 'authUsername', password: 'authPassword' } } }; Copy Here's an example of setting up a proxied network with mixed network zone assets: var proxyRules = {singleProxy: {host:\"http://entproxy.mycompany.com\"}, bypassList:['s3.amazonaws.com','*.localcdn.com'] } $network.setProxyAdvanced(proxyRules) Copy $network.clearProxy() Clears/removes the current proxy configuration. Returns This method returns a Promise that will resolve once the configuration has been applied. $network.getProxy() This method returns the current proxy configuration. It must be synchronized in a promise callback. Examples An example of synchronizing getProxy with $network.setProxy(); and $network.clearProxy();: var assert = require('assert'); $network.setProxy(\"http://user:password@myproxyurl.com\") .then(function () { console.log('Proxy configuration applied'); //Note: $network.getProxy() is not synchronized with the webdriver Control Flow. //To make sure we get the proxy configuration after the call to setProxy() above // succeeds we need to use a promise callback var proxyData = $network.getProxy(); console.log(proxyData); }) .then(function () { // Again: getProxy() is not synchronized with the Webdriver Control Flow: we //need this promise callback otherwise clearProxy() might be called before the call // to getProxy() above returns return $network.clearProxy(); }) .then(function () { console.log('Proxy configuration cleared'); // We need this promise callback for reasons explained above var proxyData = $network.getProxy(); assert.equal(proxyData.rules, null); }); Copy Proxy properties Important This proxy information applies only to these versions: API monitors: 0.4.0, 0.2.2, 0.2.1, 0.1.0 Scripted monitors: 0.1.0 In order to analyze and collect your HTTP traffic metrics, New Relic must ensure the traffic passes through a conceptual funnel. Our synthetic monitoring includes a software funnel component capable of analyzing the HTTP requests or responses and then recording the information. New Relic's scripted browser monitors (versions 0.4.x and lower) include a mechanism to do this analysis without needing an HTTP proxy, so you don't have to configure anything. New Relic's API test (versions 0.4.x and lower) provides an $http object that is pre-configured to make the requests pass through the internal HTTP proxy. This allows you to write your test without including any proxy settings. If you want to use some other way to generate HTTP traffic while still collecting the HTTP traffic metrics, you can use $env.PROXY_HOST and $env.PROXY_PORT. To record traffic metrics, be sure to include these properties in your script.",

      "body": "This document is for synthetic monitor versions 0.4.x or lower. See also the documentation for Synthetic monitor versions 0.5 or higher. Overview Synthetic scripted browsers provide you access to the Selenium Webdriver APIs 2.47.0 via the variables $driver and $browser. In particular: $driver provides all the exports from the selenium-webdriver module (for example, ActionSequence, Button, By, WebElement, etc.). $browser is a synthetic-flavored instance of selenium-webdriver.WebDriver(): it exposes the main basic WebDriver APIs like get() and findElement(), as well as some synthetic custom APIs. This document describes the functions available for synthetic scripted browser monitors version 0.4.0 or lower. For the newest monitor documentation, see monitor version 0.5.0+ documentation. Other relevant documentation: For more on synthetic scripting, see Write scripted browsers. For example scripts, see Scripted browser examples. For more information about monitor versions and runtime differences, see Runtime environments. To view and share scripted browser examples, check out topics tagged synthetic-script in New Relic's Explorers Hub. Top-level functions: Build your script New Relic calls top-level functions directly from your $browser instance. These provide a wide range of functionality that covers many basic scriptable actions. Function Return value $browser.actions() Creates a new action sequence using this driver. For a list of available actions, see ActionSequence: Link multiple actions. void $browser.addHeader(headerKey: string, headerValue: string) Adds header headerKey with value headerValue to the runtime. void $browser.addHeaders(headers: ?) Adds a map of headers to the runtime. void $browser.deleteHeader(header: string) Deletes a specific header from the runtime. void $browser.deleteHeaders(header: [string]) Deletes all headers in argument from runtime. void $browser.addHostnameToBlacklist(hostname: string) Disallows a hostname. Allows use wildcards. void $browser.addHostnamesToBlacklist(hostnameArr: [string]) Disallows all hostnames in an array of arguments. Allows use wildcards. void $browser.addHostnameToWhitelist(hostname: string) Allows a hostname blocked by default in synthetic monitoring. void $browser.addHostnamesToWhitelist(hostnameArr: [string]) Allows all hostnames in argument. void $browser.deleteHostnameFromBlacklist(hostname: string) Removes a hostname from this browser instance's blacklist. void $browser.deleteHostnamesFromBlacklist(hostnameArr: [string]) Removes all hostnames in argument from the disallowed list. void $browser.deleteHostnameFromWhitelist(hostnameArr: [string]) Removes a hostname from this browser instance's allowed list. void $browser.deleteHostnamesFromWhitelist(hostnameArr: [string]) Removes all hostnames in argument from this browser instance's allowed list. void $browser.executeAsyncScript(script: ?, var_args: ?) Schedules a command to execute asynchronous JavaScript in the context of the currently selected frame or window. promise $browser.executeScript(script: ?, var_args: ?) Schedules a command to execute JavaScript in the context of the currently selected frame or window. promise $browser.findElement(locator: $driver.Locator) Schedule a command to find an element on the page. If not found, New Relic returns an error. WebElement $browser.findElements(locator: $driver.Locator) Schedule a command to search for multiple elements on the page. promise $browser.waitForAndFindElement(locator: $driver.Locator [, timeout: number) Schedule a command to wait for and find an element on the page, and another command to wait for it to be visible. If not found, New Relic returns an error. The timeout value is an optional one, and gets applied separately to both tasks of finding the element and waiting for its visibility. This means at worst case, this method can take up to twice the provided timeout value. The default timeout value is 1000 ms (1 second). promise $browser.get(url: string) Loads a webpage in a synthetic browser. promise $browser.getAllWindowHandles() Schedules a command to retrieve the current list of available window handles. promise $browser.getCapabilities() A promise that will resolve with the instance's capabilities. promise $browser.getCurrentUrl() Schedules a command to retrieve the URL of the current page. promise $browser.getHeaders() Returns a map of currently configured headers. map $browser.getPageSource() Schedules a command to retrieve the current page's source. The page source returned is a representation of the underlying DOM; do not expect it to be formatted or escaped in the same way as the response sent from the web server. promise $browser.getSession() A promise for this client's session. promise $browser.getTitle() Schedules a command to retrieve the current page's title. promise $browser.getWindowHandle() Schedules a command to retrieve the current window handle. promise $browser.isElementPresent(locatorOrElement: $driver.Locator) Schedules a command to test if an element is present on the page. If given a DOM element, this function will check if it belongs to the document the driver is currently focused on. Otherwise, the function will test if at least one element can be found with the given search criteria. promise $browser.manage() The options interface for this instance.

To create a new action sequence, use $browser.actions(). To link multiple actions together into a sequence, include perform() after each. This executes and then terminates individual sequences, including single-action sequences. The following table contains a list of available actions. For more information, see the WebDriver ActionSequence documentation. Function Return value click(opt_elementOrButton: ?, opt_button: ?) Clicks a mouse button. If an element is provided, the mouse will first be moved to the center of that element. This is equivalent to WebElement.click(). actionsequence doubleClick(opt_elementOrButton: ?, opt_button: ?) Double-clicks a mouse button. If an element is provided, the mouse will first be moved to the center of that element. actionsequence dragAndDrop(element: ?, location: ?) Convenience function for performing a \"drag and drop\" maneuver. The target element may be moved to the location of another element, or by an offset (in pixels). The location is an object with two properties x and y: {x: x_offset, y: y_offset}. actionsequence keyDown(key: ?) Performs a modifier key press. Must be one of ALT, CONTROL, SHIFT, COMMAND, or META. The modifier key is not released until keyUp() or sendKeys() is called. The key press will be targeted at the currently focused element. actionsequence keyUp(key: ?) Performs a modifier key release. The release is targeted at the currently focused element. actionsequence mouseDown(opt_elementOrButton: ?, opt_button: ?) Presses a mouse button. The mouse button will not be released until mouseUp is called, regardless of whether that call is made in this sequence or another. The behavior for out-of-order events (such as calling mouseDown() or click() when the button is already held down) is undefined. actionsequence mouseUp(opt_elementOrButton: ?, opt_button: ?) Releases a mouse button. Behavior is undefined for calling this function without a previous call to mouseDown(). actionsequence mouseMove(location: ?, offset: ?) Moves the mouse. The location to move to may be specified in terms of the mouse's current location, an offset relative to the top-left corner of an element, or an element (in which case the middle of the element is used). actionsequence perform() Executes this action sequence. promise sendKeys(args: ?) Simulates typing multiple keys. Each modifier key encountered in the sequence will not be released until it is encountered again. All key events will be targeted at the currently focused element. For a full list of supported non-alphanumeric keys, see the WebDriver enum key documentation. actionsequence Promises: Link actions into sequences You can also execute functions directly on promises. Synthetic monitoring is a native Node.js environment and uses standard Node.js promises. These functions evaluate the status of promises, cancel them, and more. In particular, you can create sequences of actions with the then() function and its siblings, thenFinally() and thenCatch(). For more information, see Sequence actions. Function Return value cancel(string: reason) Cancels the computation of this promise's value, rejecting the promise in the process. This method is a no-op if the promise has already been resolved. void isPending() Whether this promise's value is still being computed. boolean then(opt_callback: fn(T: ?), opt_errback: fn()) Registers listeners for when this instance is resolved. This is the basic function used to link synchronous actions in your script. promise thenFinally(callback: fn()) Registers a listener to invoke when this promise is resolved, regardless of whether the promise's value was successfully computed. promise thenCatch(callback: fn()) Registers a listener for when this promise is rejected. promise Navigate: Move through browser history The $browser.navigate() function exposes a number of functions that allow you to move backwards and forwards through your browser history, refresh your page and navigate to new pages. Function Return value back() Move back by one step in the browser's history. void forward() Move forward by one step in the browser's history. void refresh() Refresh the current page. void to(string: url) Load a new webpage in the current browser window. $browser.navigate().to() is equivalent to $browser.get(). void Conditions: Pause and wait for conditions Used with $browser.wait, until pauses your script execution until the condition is matched.

      "body": "This document describes scripted browser functions available for synthetic monitors versions 0.5.x or higher. If you are using older monitor versions, see the monitor version 0.4.0 and lower documentation. For more on monitor versions and runtime differences, see Runtime environments. Selenium Webdriver APIs The synthetic scripted browsers provide access to the Selenium Webdriver APIs 3.6.0 for monitor version 0.6.x and Selenium Webdriver APIs 3.5.0 for monitor version 0.5.x via the variables $driver and $browser. In particular: $driver provides all the exports from the selenium-webdriver module (for example, ActionSequence, Button, By, WebElement, etc.). $browser is a synthetic monitoring instance of selenium-webdriver.WebDriver(). It exposes the main basic WebDriver APIs like get() and findElement(), as well as some synthetic custom APIs.

      "body": "You can use New Relic's containerized private minions (CPM). These are Docker container-based private minions that accept and execute synthetic monitors against your private locations. The CPM can operate in a Docker container system environment or a Kubernetes container orchestration system environment. The CPM will auto-detect its environment to select the appropriate operating mode. General private minion features Because the CPM operates as a container instead of a virtual machine, it delivers many features: Easy to install, start, and update Runs on: Linux macOS Windows Enhanced security and support for non-root user execution Ability to leverage a Docker container as a sandbox environment Customizable monitor check timeout Custom provided modules for scripted monitor types Kubernetes-specific features Also, the CPM delivers the following features in a Kubernetes environment: Integrates with the Kubernetes API to delegate runtime lifecycle management to Kubernetes Does not require privileged access to the Docker socket Supports hosted and on-premise Kubernetes clusters Supports various container engines such as Docker and Containerd Deployable via Helm charts as well as configuration YAMLs Allows job (ping vs. non-ping checks) based resource allocation for optimum resource management Observability offered via the New Relic One Kubernetes cluster explorer System requirements and compatibility To host CPMs, your system must meet the minimum requirements for the chosen system environment. Caution Do not modify any CPM files. New Relic is not liable for any modifications you make. For more information, contact your account representative or a New Relic technical sales rep. Docker container system environment requirements Compatibility for Requirements Operating system Linux kernel: 3.10 or higher. macOS: 10.11 or higher. Windows: Windows 10 64-bit or higher. You must also configure Docker to run Linux containers in order for CPMs to work on Windows systems. Processor A modern, multi-core CPU Memory 2.5 GiB of RAM per CPU core (dedicated) Disk space A minimum of 10 GB per host Docker version Docker 17.12.1-ce or higher Private location key You must have a private location key Caution The Docker CPM is not designed for use with container orchestrators like AWS ECS, Docker Swarm, Apache Mesos, Azure Container Instances, etc. Running the Docker CPM in a container orchestrator will result in unexpected issues because it is itself a container orchestrator. If you're using container orchestration, see our Kubernetes CPM requirements. Kubernetes container orchestration system environment requirements (CPM v3.0.0 or higher) Compatibility for Requirements Operating system Linux kernel: 3.10 or higher macOS: 10.11 or higher Windows: Windows 10 64-bit or higher Processor A modern, multi-core CPU Minion pod CPU (vCPU/Core): 0.5 up to 0.75 Memory: 800 Mi up to 1.6 Gi Resources allocated to a Minion pod are user configurable. Runner pod CPU (vCPU/Core): 0.5 up to 1 Memory: 1.25 Gi up to 3 Gi For a scripted API check, 1.25 Gi will be requested with a limit of 2.5 Gi. For a simple browser or scripted browser check, 2 Gi will be requested with a limit of 3 Gi. Additional considerations: Resources allocated to a runner pod are not user configurable. The maximum limit-request resource ratio for both CPU and memory is 2. Disk space Persistent volume (PV) of at least 10 Gi in size Note that if a ReadWriteOnce (RWO) PV is provided to the minion, an implicit node affinity will be established to ensure the minion and the runner containers are scheduled on the same node. This is required to allow the minion and the associated runners access to the PV, as an RWO PV can be accessed only by a single node in the cluster. Kubernetes version We recommend that your Kubernetes cluster supports Kubernetes v1.15. Caution We have identified a compatibility issue with Kubernetes v1.21+. A workaround is available by disabling the BoundServiceAccountTokenVolume feature gate on the cluster. Private location key You must have a private location key Helm Follow installation instructions for Helm v3 for your OS. Kubectl Follow installation instructions for Kubectl for your OS. To view versions, dependencies, default values for how many runner pods start with each minion, the Persistent volume access mode, and more, please see Show help and examples below. Private location key Before launching CPMs, you must have a private location key. Your CPM uses the key to authenticate against New Relic and run monitors associated with that private location. To find the key for existing private location: Go to one.newrelic.com > Synthetics > Private locations. In the Private locations index, locate the private location you want your CPM to be assigned to. Note the key associated with the private location with the key icon. Sandboxing and Docker dependencies Sandboxing and Docker dependencies are applicable to the CPM in a Docker container system environment. Docker dependencies The CPM runs in Docker and is able to leverage Docker as a sandboxing technology. This ensures complete isolation of the monitor execution, which improves security, reliability, and repeatability. Every time a scripted or browser monitor is executed, the CPM creates a brand new Docker container to run it in called a runner. The minion container needs to be configured to communicate with the Docker engine in order to spawn additional runner containers. Each spawned container is then dedicated to run a check associated with the synthetic monitor running on the private location the minion container is associated with. There are two crucial dependencies at launch. To enable sandboxing, ensure that: Your writable and executable directory is mounted at /tmp. The writable directory can be any directory you want the CPM to write into, but New Relic recommends the system's own /tmp to make things easy. Your writable Docker UNIX socket is mounted at /var/run/docker.sock or DOCKER_HOST environment variable. For more information, see Docker's Daemon socket option. Caution Core count on the host determines how many runner containers the CPM can run concurrently on the host. Since memory requirements are scaled to the expected count of runner containers, we recommend not running multiple CPMs on the same host to avoid resource contention. For additional information on sandboxing and running as a root or non-root user, see Security, sandboxing, and running as non-root. Install and update CPM versions Both installing and updating the CPM use the same command to pull the latest Docker image from the Quay.io repository where the CPM Docker image is hosted. Go to quay.io/repository/newrelic/synthetics-minion for a list of all the releases. CPM images are also hosted on Docker Hub. Go to hub.docker.com/r/newrelic/synthetics-minion/tags for a list of all the releases. Unless hosting the images in a local image repository, connections to either quay.io or docker.io will need to be allowed through your firewall in order for Docker to pull the synthetics-minion and synthetics-minion-runner images. The \"runner\" image is pulled automatically on startup of the synthetics-minion container. See Docker environment configuration and Kubernetes environment configuration for details on how to set a local repository and the runner registry endpoint. Start the CPM To start the CPM, follow the applicable Docker or Kubernetes instructions. Docker start procedure Locate your private location key. Ensure you've enabled Docker dependencies for sandboxing and installed CPM on your system. Run the appropriate script for your system. Tailor the common defaults for /tmp and /var/run/docker.sock in the following examples to match your system. Linux/macOS: docker run \\ --name YOUR_CONTAINER_NAME \\ -e \"MINION_PRIVATE_LOCATION_KEY=YOUR_PRIVATE_LOCATION_KEY\" \\ -v /tmp:/tmp:rw \\ -v /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock:rw \\ -d \\ --restart unless-stopped \\ quay.io/newrelic/synthetics-minion:latest Copy Windows: docker run ^ --name YOUR_CONTAINER_NAME ^ -e \"MINION_PRIVATE_LOCATION_KEY=YOUR_PRIVATE_LOCATION_KEY\" ^ -v /tmp:/tmp:rw ^ -v /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock:rw ^ -d ^ --restart unless-stopped ^ quay.io/newrelic/synthetics-minion:latest Copy View the logs for your minion container: docker logs --follow YOUR_CONTAINER_NAME Copy When a message similar to Synthetics Minion is ready and servicing location YOUR_PRIVATE_LOCATION_LABEL appears, your CPM is up and ready to run monitors assigned to that location. Kubernetes start procedure Locate your private location key. Set up the a namespace for the CPM in your Kubernetes cluster: kubectl create namespace YOUR_NAMESPACE Copy Copy the Helm charts from the New Relic Helm repo. If you are copying the charts for the first time: helm repo add YOUR_REPO_NAME https://helm-charts.newrelic.com Copy If you previously copied the Helm charts from the New Relic Helm repo, then get the latest: helm repo update Copy Install the CPM with the following Helm command: For a fresh installation of the CPM: helm install YOUR_CPM_NAME YOUR_REPO_NAME/synthetics-minion -n YOUR_NAMESPACE --set synthetics.privateLocationKey=YOUR_PRIVATE_LOCATION_KEY Copy To update an existing CPM installation: helm upgrade YOUR_CPM_NAME YOUR_REPO_NAME/synthetics-minion -n YOUR_NAMESPACE --set synthetics.privateLocationKey=YOUR_PRIVATE_LOCATION_KEY Copy Check if the minion pod is up and running: kubectl get -n YOUR_NAMESPACE pods Copy Once the status attribute of each pod is shown as running, your CPM is up and ready to run monitors assigned to your private location. Stop or delete the CPM On a Docker container system environment, use the Docker stop procedure to stop the CPM from running. On a Kubernetes container orchestration system environment, use the Kubernetes delete procedure to stop the CPM from running. Docker stop procedure You can stop a Docker container either by the container name, or the container ID. Container name stop for Linux, macOS, and Windows: docker stop YOUR_CONTAINER_NAME docker rm YOUR_CONTAINER_NAME Copy Container ID stop for Linux/macOS: In the examples the container is stopped and removed. To only stop the container, omit docker rm $CONTAINER_ID. CONTAINER_ID=$(docker ps -aqf name=YOUR_CONTAINER_NAME) docker stop $CONTAINER_ID docker rm $CONTAINER_ID Copy Container ID stop for Windows: In the examples the container is stopped and removed. To only stop the container, omit docker rm $CONTAINER_ID. FOR /F \"tokens=*\" %%CID IN ('docker ps -aqf name=YOUR_CONTAINER_NAME') do (SET CONTAINER_ID=%%CID) docker stop %CONTAINER_ID% docker rm %CONTAINER_ID% Copy Kubernetes delete procedure Get the MINION_POD_INSTALLATION_NAME of the minion pod you want to delete: helm list -n YOUR_NAMESPACE Copy Delete the minion pod: helm uninstall -n YOUR_NAMESPACE MINION_POD_INSTALLATION_NAME Copy Delete the namespace set up for the CPM in your Kubernetes cluster: kubectl delete namespace YOUR_NAMESPACE Copy Show help and examples Use these options as applicable: To get a list of the most commonly used run options directly in the command line interface, run the show help command. To show CPM usage examples as well as the list of all the available run options, run this command: docker run quay.io/newrelic/synthetics-minion:latest help Copy To keep track of Docker logs and verify the health of your monitors, see Containerized private minion (CPM) maintenance and monitoring. For a CPM in the Kubernetes container orchestration system environment, the following Helm show commands can be used to view the chart.yaml and the values.yaml, respectively: helm show chart YOUR_REPO_NAME/synthetics-minion Copy helm show values YOUR_REPO_NAME/synthetics-minion Copy Show license information To show the licensing information for the open source software that we use in the CPM, run the LICENSE command. Run this command to view license information for CPM versions 2.2.27 or higher: docker run quay.io/newrelic/synthetics-minion:latest LICENSE Copy Some of our open-source software is listed under multiple software licenses, and in that case we have listed the license we've chosen to use. Our license information is also available in the our licenses documentation. Configure CPM You can configure the containerized private minion with custom npm modules, preserve data between launches, use environment variables, and more. For more information, see CPM configuration. Networks For both Docker and Kubernetes, the CPM and its runner containers will inherit network settings from the host. For an example of this on a Docker container system environment, see the Docker site. A new bridge network is created for each runner container. This means networking command options like --network and --dns passed to the CPM container at launch (such as through Docker run commands on a Docker container system environment) are not inherited or used by the runner containers. When these networks are created, they pull from the default IP address pool configured for daemon. For an example of this on a Docker container system environment, see the Docker site. Typically, the runner network is removed after the check is completed. However, if a CPM exits while a check is still running, or exits in another unexpected circumstance, these networks may get orphaned. This can potentially use up IP address space that is available to the Docker daemon. If this happens, you may see INTERNAL ENGINE ERROR code: 31 entries in your CPM logging when trying to create a new runner container. To clean these up in Docker container system environments only, run docker network prune. Security, sandboxing, and running as non-root By default, the software running inside a CPM is executed with root user privileges. This is suitable for most scenarios, as the execution is sandboxed. In a Docker container system environment: To change the default AppArmor profile used by containers that CPM spawns to run monitors, see the environment variable MINION_RUNNER_APPARMOR (CPM version 3.0.3 or higher) or MINION_DOCKER_RUNNER_APPARMOR (CPM version up to v3.0.2). To run the CPM as a non-root user, additional steps are required: Run as non-root user for Docker For more information, see Docker's official documentation about security and AppArmor security profiles. If your environment requires you to run the CPM as a non-root user, follow this procedure. In the following example, the non-root user is my_user. Ensure that my_user can use the Docker engine on the host: Verify that my_user belongs to the \"docker\" system group. OR Enable the Docker TCP socket option, and pass the DOCKER_HOST environment variable to CPM. Verify that my_user has read/write permissions to all the directories and volumes passed to CPM. To set these permission, use the chmod command. Get the uid of my_user for use in the run command: id -u my_user. Once these conditions are met, use the option \"-u <uid>:<gid>\" when launching CPM: docker run ... -u 1002 ... Copy OR docker run ... -u 1002 -e DOCKER_HOST=http://localhost:2375 ... Copy Docker image repository A single CPM Docker image serves both the Docker container system environment and Kubernetes container orchestration system environment. The Docker image is hosted on quay.io. To make sure your Docker image is up-to-date, see the quay.io newrelic/synthetics-minion repository. Additional considerations for CPM connection Connection Description CPMs without Internet access A CPM can operate without access to the internet, but with some exceptions. The public internet health check can be disabled using the environment variables named MINION_NETWORK_HEALTHCHECK_DISABLED for a Docker container system environment or synthetics.minionNetworkHealthCheckDisabled for a Kubernetes container orchestration system environment. The CPM needs to be able to contact the \"synthetics-horde.nr-data.net\" domain. This is necessary for it to report data to New Relic and to receive monitors to execute. Ask your network administration if this is a problem and how to set up exceptions. Communicate with Synthetics via a proxy To set up communication with New Relic by proxy, use the environment variables named MINION_API_PROXY*. Arguments passed at launch This applies to a Docker container environment only. Arguments passed to the CPM container at launch do not get passed on to the containers spawned by the CPM. Docker has no concept of \"inheritance\" or a \"hierarchy\" of containers, and we don't copy the configuration that is passed from CPM to the monitor-running containers. The only shared configuration between them is the one set at the Docker daemon level.",

      "body": "You can use New Relic's containerized private minions (CPM). These are Docker container-based private minions that accept and execute synthetic monitors against your private locations. The CPM can operate in a Docker container system environment or a Kubernetes container orchestration system environment. The CPM will auto-detect its environment to select the appropriate operating mode. General private minion features Because the CPM operates as a container instead of a virtual machine, it delivers many features: Easy to install, start, and update Runs on: Linux macOS Windows Enhanced security and support for non-root user execution Ability to leverage a Docker container as a sandbox environment Customizable monitor check timeout Custom provided modules for scripted monitor types Kubernetes-specific features Also, the CPM delivers the following features in a Kubernetes environment: Integrates with the Kubernetes API to delegate runtime lifecycle management to Kubernetes Does not require privileged access to the Docker socket Supports hosted and on-premise Kubernetes clusters Supports various container engines such as Docker and Containerd Deployable via Helm charts as well as configuration YAMLs Allows job (ping vs. non-ping checks) based resource allocation for optimum resource management Observability offered via the New Relic One Kubernetes cluster explorer System requirements and compatibility To host CPMs, your system must meet the minimum requirements for the chosen system environment. Caution Do not modify any CPM files. New Relic is not liable for any modifications you make. For more information, contact your account representative or a New Relic technical sales rep. Docker container system environment requirements Compatibility for Requirements Operating system Linux kernel: 3.10 or higher. macOS: 10.11 or higher. Windows: Windows 10 64-bit or higher. You must also configure Docker to run Linux containers in order for CPMs to work on Windows systems. Processor A modern, multi-core CPU Memory 2.5 GiB of RAM per CPU core (dedicated) Disk space A minimum of 10 GB per host Docker version Docker 17.12.1-ce or higher Private location key You must have a private location key Caution The Docker CPM is not designed for use with container orchestrators like AWS ECS, Docker Swarm, Apache Mesos, Azure Container Instances, etc. Running the Docker CPM in a container orchestrator will result in unexpected issues because it is itself a container orchestrator. If you're using container orchestration, see our Kubernetes CPM requirements. Kubernetes container orchestration system environment requirements (CPM v3.0.0 or higher) Compatibility for Requirements Operating system Linux kernel: 3.10 or higher macOS: 10.11 or higher Windows: Windows 10 64-bit or higher Processor A modern, multi-core CPU Minion pod CPU (vCPU/Core): 0.5 up to 0.75 Memory: 800 Mi up to 1.6 Gi Resources allocated to a Minion pod are user configurable. Runner pod CPU (vCPU/Core): 0.5 up to 1 Memory: 1.25 Gi up to 3 Gi For a scripted API check, 1.25 Gi will be requested with a limit of 2.5 Gi. For a simple browser or scripted browser check, 2 Gi will be requested with a limit of 3 Gi. Additional considerations: Resources allocated to a runner pod are not user configurable. The maximum limit-request resource ratio for both CPU and memory is 2. Disk space Persistent volume (PV) of at least 10 Gi in size Note that if a ReadWriteOnce (RWO) PV is provided to the minion, an implicit node affinity will be established to ensure the minion and the runner containers are scheduled on the same node. This is required to allow the minion and the associated runners access to the PV, as an RWO PV can be accessed only by a single node in the cluster. Kubernetes version We recommend that your Kubernetes cluster supports Kubernetes v1.15. Caution We have identified a compatibility issue with Kubernetes v1.21+. A workaround is available by disabling the BoundServiceAccountTokenVolume feature gate on the cluster. Private location key You must have a private location key Helm Follow installation instructions for Helm v3 for your OS. Kubectl Follow installation instructions for Kubectl for your OS. To view versions, dependencies, default values for how many runner pods start with each minion, the Persistent volume access mode, and more, please see Show help and examples below. Private location key Before launching CPMs, you must have a private location key. Your CPM uses the key to authenticate against New Relic and run monitors associated with that private location. To find the key for existing private location: Go to one.newrelic.com > Synthetics > Private locations. In the Private locations index, locate the private location you want your CPM to be assigned to. Note the key associated with the private location with the key icon. Sandboxing and Docker dependencies Sandboxing and Docker dependencies are applicable to the CPM in a Docker container system environment. Docker dependencies The CPM runs in Docker and is able to leverage Docker as a sandboxing technology. This ensures complete isolation of the monitor execution, which improves security, reliability, and repeatability. Every time a scripted or browser monitor is executed, the CPM creates a brand new Docker container to run it in called a runner. The minion container needs to be configured to communicate with the Docker engine in order to spawn additional runner containers. Each spawned container is then dedicated to run a check associated with the synthetic monitor running on the private location the minion container is associated with. There are two crucial dependencies at launch. To enable sandboxing, ensure that: Your writable and executable directory is mounted at /tmp. The writable directory can be any directory you want the CPM to write into, but New Relic recommends the system's own /tmp to make things easy. Your writable Docker UNIX socket is mounted at /var/run/docker.sock or DOCKER_HOST environment variable. For more information, see Docker's Daemon socket option. Caution Core count on the host determines how many runner containers the CPM can run concurrently on the host. Since memory requirements are scaled to the expected count of runner containers, we recommend not running multiple CPMs on the same host to avoid resource contention. For additional information on sandboxing and running as a root or non-root user, see Security, sandboxing, and running as non-root. Install and update CPM versions Both installing and updating the CPM use the same command to pull the latest Docker image from the Quay.io repository where the CPM Docker image is hosted. Go to quay.io/repository/newrelic/synthetics-minion for a list of all the releases. CPM images are also hosted on Docker Hub. Go to hub.docker.com/r/newrelic/synthetics-minion/tags for a list of all the releases. Unless hosting the images in a local image repository, connections to either quay.io or docker.io will need to be allowed through your firewall in order for Docker to pull the synthetics-minion and synthetics-minion-runner images. The \"runner\" image is pulled automatically on startup of the synthetics-minion container. See Docker environment configuration and Kubernetes environment configuration for details on how to set a local repository and the runner registry endpoint. Start the CPM To start the CPM, follow the applicable Docker or Kubernetes instructions. Docker start procedure Locate your private location key. Ensure you've enabled Docker dependencies for sandboxing and installed CPM on your system. Run the appropriate script for your system. Tailor the common defaults for /tmp and /var/run/docker.sock in the following examples to match your system. Linux/macOS: docker run \\ --name YOUR_CONTAINER_NAME \\ -e \"MINION_PRIVATE_LOCATION_KEY=YOUR_PRIVATE_LOCATION_KEY\" \\ -v /tmp:/tmp:rw \\ -v /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock:rw \\ -d \\ --restart unless-stopped \\ quay.io/newrelic/synthetics-minion:latest Copy Windows: docker run ^ --name YOUR_CONTAINER_NAME ^ -e \"MINION_PRIVATE_LOCATION_KEY=YOUR_PRIVATE_LOCATION_KEY\" ^ -v /tmp:/tmp:rw ^ -v /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock:rw ^ -d ^ --restart unless-stopped ^ quay.io/newrelic/synthetics-minion:latest Copy View the logs for your minion container: docker logs --follow YOUR_CONTAINER_NAME Copy When a message similar to Synthetics Minion is ready and servicing location YOUR_PRIVATE_LOCATION_LABEL appears, your CPM is up and ready to run monitors assigned to that location. Kubernetes start procedure Locate your private location key. Set up the a namespace for the CPM in your Kubernetes cluster: kubectl create namespace YOUR_NAMESPACE Copy Copy the Helm charts from the New Relic Helm repo. If you are copying the charts for the first time: helm repo add YOUR_REPO_NAME https://helm-charts.newrelic.com Copy If you previously copied the Helm charts from the New Relic Helm repo, then get the latest: helm repo update Copy Install the CPM with the following Helm command: For a fresh installation of the CPM: helm install YOUR_CPM_NAME YOUR_REPO_NAME/synthetics-minion -n YOUR_NAMESPACE --set synthetics.privateLocationKey=YOUR_PRIVATE_LOCATION_KEY Copy To update an existing CPM installation: helm upgrade YOUR_CPM_NAME YOUR_REPO_NAME/synthetics-minion -n YOUR_NAMESPACE --set synthetics.privateLocationKey=YOUR_PRIVATE_LOCATION_KEY Copy Check if the minion pod is up and running: kubectl get -n YOUR_NAMESPACE pods Copy Once the status attribute of each pod is shown as running, your CPM is up and ready to run monitors assigned to your private location. Stop or delete the CPM On a Docker container system environment, use the Docker stop procedure to stop the CPM from running. On a Kubernetes container orchestration system environment, use the Kubernetes delete procedure to stop the CPM from running. Docker stop procedure You can stop a Docker container either by the container name, or the container ID. Container name stop for Linux, macOS, and Windows: docker stop YOUR_CONTAINER_NAME docker rm YOUR_CONTAINER_NAME Copy Container ID stop for Linux/macOS: In the examples the container is stopped and removed. To only stop the container, omit docker rm $CONTAINER_ID. CONTAINER_ID=$(docker ps -aqf name=YOUR_CONTAINER_NAME) docker stop $CONTAINER_ID docker rm $CONTAINER_ID Copy Container ID stop for Windows: In the examples the container is stopped and removed. To only stop the container, omit docker rm $CONTAINER_ID. FOR /F \"tokens=*\" %%CID IN ('docker ps -aqf name=YOUR_CONTAINER_NAME') do (SET CONTAINER_ID=%%CID) docker stop %CONTAINER_ID% docker rm %CONTAINER_ID% Copy Kubernetes delete procedure Get the MINION_POD_INSTALLATION_NAME of the minion pod you want to delete: helm list -n YOUR_NAMESPACE Copy Delete the minion pod: helm uninstall -n YOUR_NAMESPACE MINION_POD_INSTALLATION_NAME Copy Delete the namespace set up for the CPM in your Kubernetes cluster: kubectl delete namespace YOUR_NAMESPACE Copy Show help and examples Use these options as applicable: To get a list of the most commonly used run options directly in the command line interface, run the show help command. To show CPM usage examples as well as the list of all the available run options, run this command: docker run quay.io/newrelic/synthetics-minion:latest help Copy To keep track of Docker logs and verify the health of your monitors, see Containerized private minion (CPM) maintenance and monitoring. For a CPM in the Kubernetes container orchestration system environment, the following Helm show commands can be used to view the chart.yaml and the values.yaml, respectively: helm show chart YOUR_REPO_NAME/synthetics-minion Copy helm show values YOUR_REPO_NAME/synthetics-minion Copy Show license information To show the licensing information for the open source software that we use in the CPM, run the LICENSE command. Run this command to view license information for CPM versions 2.2.27 or higher: docker run quay.io/newrelic/synthetics-minion:latest LICENSE Copy Some of our open-source software is listed under multiple software licenses, and in that case we have listed the license we've chosen to use. Our license information is also available in the our licenses documentation. Configure CPM You can configure the containerized private minion with custom npm modules, preserve data between launches, use environment variables, and more. For more information, see CPM configuration. Networks For both Docker and Kubernetes, the CPM and its runner containers will inherit network settings from the host. For an example of this on a Docker container system environment, see the Docker site. A new bridge network is created for each runner container. This means networking command options like --network and --dns passed to the CPM container at launch (such as through Docker run commands on a Docker container system environment) are not inherited or used by the runner containers. When these networks are created, they pull from the default IP address pool configured for daemon. For an example of this on a Docker container system environment, see the Docker site. Typically, the runner network is removed after the check is completed. However, if a CPM exits while a check is still running, or exits in another unexpected circumstance, these networks may get orphaned. This can potentially use up IP address space that is available to the Docker daemon. If this happens, you may see INTERNAL ENGINE ERROR code: 31 entries in your CPM logging when trying to create a new runner container. To clean these up in Docker container system environments only, run docker network prune. Security, sandboxing, and running as non-root By default, the software running inside a CPM is executed with root user privileges. This is suitable for most scenarios, as the execution is sandboxed. In a Docker container system environment: To change the default AppArmor profile used by containers that CPM spawns to run monitors, see the environment variable MINION_RUNNER_APPARMOR (CPM version 3.0.3 or higher) or MINION_DOCKER_RUNNER_APPARMOR (CPM version up to v3.0.2). To run the CPM as a non-root user, additional steps are required: Run as non-root user for Docker For more information, see Docker's official documentation about security and AppArmor security profiles. If your environment requires you to run the CPM as a non-root user, follow this procedure. In the following example, the non-root user is my_user. Ensure that my_user can use the Docker engine on the host: Verify that my_user belongs to the \"docker\" system group. OR Enable the Docker TCP socket option, and pass the DOCKER_HOST environment variable to CPM. Verify that my_user has read/write permissions to all the directories and volumes passed to CPM. To set these permission, use the chmod command. Get the uid of my_user for use in the run command: id -u my_user. Once these conditions are met, use the option \"-u <uid>:<gid>\" when launching CPM: docker run ... -u 1002 ... Copy OR docker run ... -u 1002 -e DOCKER_HOST=http://localhost:2375 ... Copy Docker image repository A single CPM Docker image serves both the Docker container system environment and Kubernetes container orchestration system environment. The Docker image is hosted on quay.io. To make sure your Docker image is up-to-date, see the quay.io newrelic/synthetics-minion repository. Additional considerations for CPM connection Connection Description CPMs without Internet access A CPM can operate without access to the internet, but with some exceptions. The public internet health check can be disabled using the environment variables named MINION_NETWORK_HEALTHCHECK_DISABLED for a Docker container system environment or synthetics.minionNetworkHealthCheckDisabled for a Kubernetes container orchestration system environment. The CPM needs to be able to contact the \"synthetics-horde.nr-data.net\" domain. This is necessary for it to report data to New Relic and to receive monitors to execute. Ask your network administration if this is a problem and how to set up exceptions. Communicate with Synthetics via a proxy To set up communication with New Relic by proxy, use the environment variables named MINION_API_PROXY*. Arguments passed at launch This applies to a Docker container environment only. Arguments passed to the CPM container at launch do not get passed on to the containers spawned by the CPM. Docker has no concept of \"inheritance\" or a \"hierarchy\" of containers, and we don't copy the configuration that is passed from CPM to the monitor-running containers. The only shared configuration between them is the one set at the Docker daemon level.",

      "body": "You can use New Relic's containerized private minions (CPM). These are Docker container-based private minions that accept and execute synthetic monitors against your private locations. The CPM can operate in a Docker container system environment or a Kubernetes container orchestration system environment. The CPM will auto-detect its environment to select the appropriate operating mode. General private minion features Because the CPM operates as a container instead of a virtual machine, it delivers many features: Easy to install, start, and update Runs on: Linux macOS Windows Enhanced security and support for non-root user execution Ability to leverage a Docker container as a sandbox environment Customizable monitor check timeout Custom provided modules for scripted monitor types Kubernetes-specific features Also, the CPM delivers the following features in a Kubernetes environment: Integrates with the Kubernetes API to delegate runtime lifecycle management to Kubernetes Does not require privileged access to the Docker socket Supports hosted and on-premise Kubernetes clusters Supports various container engines such as Docker and Containerd Deployable via Helm charts as well as configuration YAMLs Allows job (ping vs. non-ping checks) based resource allocation for optimum resource management Observability offered via the New Relic One Kubernetes cluster explorer System requirements and compatibility To host CPMs, your system must meet the minimum requirements for the chosen system environment. Caution Do not modify any CPM files. New Relic is not liable for any modifications you make. For more information, contact your account representative or a New Relic technical sales rep. Docker container system environment requirements Compatibility for Requirements Operating system Linux kernel: 3.10 or higher. macOS: 10.11 or higher. Windows: Windows 10 64-bit or higher. You must also configure Docker to run Linux containers in order for CPMs to work on Windows systems. Processor A modern, multi-core CPU Memory 2.5 GiB of RAM per CPU core (dedicated) Disk space A minimum of 10 GB per host Docker version Docker 17.12.1-ce or higher Private location key You must have a private location key Caution The Docker CPM is not designed for use with container orchestrators like AWS ECS, Docker Swarm, Apache Mesos, Azure Container Instances, etc. Running the Docker CPM in a container orchestrator will result in unexpected issues because it is itself a container orchestrator. If you're using container orchestration, see our Kubernetes CPM requirements. Kubernetes container orchestration system environment requirements (CPM v3.0.0 or higher) Compatibility for Requirements Operating system Linux kernel: 3.10 or higher macOS: 10.11 or higher Windows: Windows 10 64-bit or higher Processor A modern, multi-core CPU Minion pod CPU (vCPU/Core): 0.5 up to 0.75 Memory: 800 Mi up to 1.6 Gi Resources allocated to a Minion pod are user configurable. Runner pod CPU (vCPU/Core): 0.5 up to 1 Memory: 1.25 Gi up to 3 Gi For a scripted API check, 1.25 Gi will be requested with a limit of 2.5 Gi. For a simple browser or scripted browser check, 2 Gi will be requested with a limit of 3 Gi. Additional considerations: Resources allocated to a runner pod are not user configurable. The maximum limit-request resource ratio for both CPU and memory is 2. Disk space Persistent volume (PV) of at least 10 Gi in size Note that if a ReadWriteOnce (RWO) PV is provided to the minion, an implicit node affinity will be established to ensure the minion and the runner containers are scheduled on the same node. This is required to allow the minion and the associated runners access to the PV, as an RWO PV can be accessed only by a single node in the cluster. Kubernetes version We recommend that your Kubernetes cluster supports Kubernetes v1.15. Caution We have identified a compatibility issue with Kubernetes v1.21+. A workaround is available by disabling the BoundServiceAccountTokenVolume feature gate on the cluster. Private location key You must have a private location key Helm Follow installation instructions for Helm v3 for your OS. Kubectl Follow installation instructions for Kubectl for your OS. To view versions, dependencies, default values for how many runner pods start with each minion, the Persistent volume access mode, and more, please see Show help and examples below. Private location key Before launching CPMs, you must have a private location key. Your CPM uses the key to authenticate against New Relic and run monitors associated with that private location. To find the key for existing private location: Go to one.newrelic.com > Synthetics > Private locations. In the Private locations index, locate the private location you want your CPM to be assigned to. Note the key associated with the private location with the key icon. Sandboxing and Docker dependencies Sandboxing and Docker dependencies are applicable to the CPM in a Docker container system environment. Docker dependencies The CPM runs in Docker and is able to leverage Docker as a sandboxing technology. This ensures complete isolation of the monitor execution, which improves security, reliability, and repeatability. Every time a scripted or browser monitor is executed, the CPM creates a brand new Docker container to run it in called a runner. The minion container needs to be configured to communicate with the Docker engine in order to spawn additional runner containers. Each spawned container is then dedicated to run a check associated with the synthetic monitor running on the private location the minion container is associated with. There are two crucial dependencies at launch. To enable sandboxing, ensure that: Your writable and executable directory is mounted at /tmp. The writable directory can be any directory you want the CPM to write into, but New Relic recommends the system's own /tmp to make things easy. Your writable Docker UNIX socket is mounted at /var/run/docker.sock or DOCKER_HOST environment variable. For more information, see Docker's Daemon socket option. Caution Core count on the host determines how many runner containers the CPM can run concurrently on the host. Since memory requirements are scaled to the expected count of runner containers, we recommend not running multiple CPMs on the same host to avoid resource contention. For additional information on sandboxing and running as a root or non-root user, see Security, sandboxing, and running as non-root. Install and update CPM versions Both installing and updating the CPM use the same command to pull the latest Docker image from the Quay.io repository where the CPM Docker image is hosted. Go to quay.io/repository/newrelic/synthetics-minion for a list of all the releases. CPM images are also hosted on Docker Hub. Go to hub.docker.com/r/newrelic/synthetics-minion/tags for a list of all the releases. Unless hosting the images in a local image repository, connections to either quay.io or docker.io will need to be allowed through your firewall in order for Docker to pull the synthetics-minion and synthetics-minion-runner images. The \"runner\" image is pulled automatically on startup of the synthetics-minion container. See Docker environment configuration and Kubernetes environment configuration for details on how to set a local repository and the runner registry endpoint. Start the CPM To start the CPM, follow the applicable Docker or Kubernetes instructions. Docker start procedure Locate your private location key. Ensure you've enabled Docker dependencies for sandboxing and installed CPM on your system. Run the appropriate script for your system. Tailor the common defaults for /tmp and /var/run/docker.sock in the following examples to match your system. Linux/macOS: docker run \\ --name YOUR_CONTAINER_NAME \\ -e \"MINION_PRIVATE_LOCATION_KEY=YOUR_PRIVATE_LOCATION_KEY\" \\ -v /tmp:/tmp:rw \\ -v /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock:rw \\ -d \\ --restart unless-stopped \\ quay.io/newrelic/synthetics-minion:latest Copy Windows: docker run ^ --name YOUR_CONTAINER_NAME ^ -e \"MINION_PRIVATE_LOCATION_KEY=YOUR_PRIVATE_LOCATION_KEY\" ^ -v /tmp:/tmp:rw ^ -v /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock:rw ^ -d ^ --restart unless-stopped ^ quay.io/newrelic/synthetics-minion:latest Copy View the logs for your minion container: docker logs --follow YOUR_CONTAINER_NAME Copy When a message similar to Synthetics Minion is ready and servicing location YOUR_PRIVATE_LOCATION_LABEL appears, your CPM is up and ready to run monitors assigned to that location. Kubernetes start procedure Locate your private location key. Set up the a namespace for the CPM in your Kubernetes cluster: kubectl create namespace YOUR_NAMESPACE Copy Copy the Helm charts from the New Relic Helm repo. If you are copying the charts for the first time: helm repo add YOUR_REPO_NAME https://helm-charts.newrelic.com Copy If you previously copied the Helm charts from the New Relic Helm repo, then get the latest: helm repo update Copy Install the CPM with the following Helm command: For a fresh installation of the CPM: helm install YOUR_CPM_NAME YOUR_REPO_NAME/synthetics-minion -n YOUR_NAMESPACE --set synthetics.privateLocationKey=YOUR_PRIVATE_LOCATION_KEY Copy To update an existing CPM installation: helm upgrade YOUR_CPM_NAME YOUR_REPO_NAME/synthetics-minion -n YOUR_NAMESPACE --set synthetics.privateLocationKey=YOUR_PRIVATE_LOCATION_KEY Copy Check if the minion pod is up and running: kubectl get -n YOUR_NAMESPACE pods Copy Once the status attribute of each pod is shown as running, your CPM is up and ready to run monitors assigned to your private location. Stop or delete the CPM On a Docker container system environment, use the Docker stop procedure to stop the CPM from running. On a Kubernetes container orchestration system environment, use the Kubernetes delete procedure to stop the CPM from running. Docker stop procedure You can stop a Docker container either by the container name, or the container ID. Container name stop for Linux, macOS, and Windows: docker stop YOUR_CONTAINER_NAME docker rm YOUR_CONTAINER_NAME Copy Container ID stop for Linux/macOS: In the examples the container is stopped and removed. To only stop the container, omit docker rm $CONTAINER_ID. CONTAINER_ID=$(docker ps -aqf name=YOUR_CONTAINER_NAME) docker stop $CONTAINER_ID docker rm $CONTAINER_ID Copy Container ID stop for Windows: In the examples the container is stopped and removed. To only stop the container, omit docker rm $CONTAINER_ID. FOR /F \"tokens=*\" %%CID IN ('docker ps -aqf name=YOUR_CONTAINER_NAME') do (SET CONTAINER_ID=%%CID) docker stop %CONTAINER_ID% docker rm %CONTAINER_ID% Copy Kubernetes delete procedure Get the MINION_POD_INSTALLATION_NAME of the minion pod you want to delete: helm list -n YOUR_NAMESPACE Copy Delete the minion pod: helm uninstall -n YOUR_NAMESPACE MINION_POD_INSTALLATION_NAME Copy Delete the namespace set up for the CPM in your Kubernetes cluster: kubectl delete namespace YOUR_NAMESPACE Copy Show help and examples Use these options as applicable: To get a list of the most commonly used run options directly in the command line interface, run the show help command. To show CPM usage examples as well as the list of all the available run options, run this command: docker run quay.io/newrelic/synthetics-minion:latest help Copy To keep track of Docker logs and verify the health of your monitors, see Containerized private minion (CPM) maintenance and monitoring. For a CPM in the Kubernetes container orchestration system environment, the following Helm show commands can be used to view the chart.yaml and the values.yaml, respectively: helm show chart YOUR_REPO_NAME/synthetics-minion Copy helm show values YOUR_REPO_NAME/synthetics-minion Copy Show license information To show the licensing information for the open source software that we use in the CPM, run the LICENSE command. Run this command to view license information for CPM versions 2.2.27 or higher: docker run quay.io/newrelic/synthetics-minion:latest LICENSE Copy Some of our open-source software is listed under multiple software licenses, and in that case we have listed the license we've chosen to use. Our license information is also available in the our licenses documentation. Configure CPM You can configure the containerized private minion with custom npm modules, preserve data between launches, use environment variables, and more. For more information, see CPM configuration. Networks For both Docker and Kubernetes, the CPM and its runner containers will inherit network settings from the host. For an example of this on a Docker container system environment, see the Docker site. A new bridge network is created for each runner container. This means networking command options like --network and --dns passed to the CPM container at launch (such as through Docker run commands on a Docker container system environment) are not inherited or used by the runner containers. When these networks are created, they pull from the default IP address pool configured for daemon. For an example of this on a Docker container system environment, see the Docker site. Typically, the runner network is removed after the check is completed. However, if a CPM exits while a check is still running, or exits in another unexpected circumstance, these networks may get orphaned. This can potentially use up IP address space that is available to the Docker daemon. If this happens, you may see INTERNAL ENGINE ERROR code: 31 entries in your CPM logging when trying to create a new runner container. To clean these up in Docker container system environments only, run docker network prune. Security, sandboxing, and running as non-root By default, the software running inside a CPM is executed with root user privileges. This is suitable for most scenarios, as the execution is sandboxed. In a Docker container system environment: To change the default AppArmor profile used by containers that CPM spawns to run monitors, see the environment variable MINION_RUNNER_APPARMOR (CPM version 3.0.3 or higher) or MINION_DOCKER_RUNNER_APPARMOR (CPM version up to v3.0.2). To run the CPM as a non-root user, additional steps are required: Run as non-root user for Docker For more information, see Docker's official documentation about security and AppArmor security profiles. If your environment requires you to run the CPM as a non-root user, follow this procedure. In the following example, the non-root user is my_user. Ensure that my_user can use the Docker engine on the host: Verify that my_user belongs to the \"docker\" system group. OR Enable the Docker TCP socket option, and pass the DOCKER_HOST environment variable to CPM. Verify that my_user has read/write permissions to all the directories and volumes passed to CPM. To set these permission, use the chmod command. Get the uid of my_user for use in the run command: id -u my_user. Once these conditions are met, use the option \"-u <uid>:<gid>\" when launching CPM: docker run ... -u 1002 ... Copy OR docker run ... -u 1002 -e DOCKER_HOST=http://localhost:2375 ... Copy Docker image repository A single CPM Docker image serves both the Docker container system environment and Kubernetes container orchestration system environment. The Docker image is hosted on quay.io. To make sure your Docker image is up-to-date, see the quay.io newrelic/synthetics-minion repository. Additional considerations for CPM connection Connection Description CPMs without Internet access A CPM can operate without access to the internet, but with some exceptions. The public internet health check can be disabled using the environment variables named MINION_NETWORK_HEALTHCHECK_DISABLED for a Docker container system environment or synthetics.minionNetworkHealthCheckDisabled for a Kubernetes container orchestration system environment. The CPM needs to be able to contact the \"synthetics-horde.nr-data.net\" domain. This is necessary for it to report data to New Relic and to receive monitors to execute. Ask your network administration if this is a problem and how to set up exceptions. Communicate with Synthetics via a proxy To set up communication with New Relic by proxy, use the environment variables named MINION_API_PROXY*. Arguments passed at launch This applies to a Docker container environment only. Arguments passed to the CPM container at launch do not get passed on to the containers spawned by the CPM. Docker has no concept of \"inheritance\" or a \"hierarchy\" of containers, and we don't copy the configuration that is passed from CPM to the monitor-running containers. The only shared configuration between them is the one set at the Docker daemon level.",

      "body": "You can use New Relic's containerized private minions (CPM). These are Docker container-based private minions that accept and execute synthetic monitors against your private locations. The CPM can operate in a Docker container system environment or a Kubernetes container orchestration system environment. The CPM will auto-detect its environment to select the appropriate operating mode. General private minion features Because the CPM operates as a container instead of a virtual machine, it delivers many features: Easy to install, start, and update Runs on: Linux macOS Windows Enhanced security and support for non-root user execution Ability to leverage a Docker container as a sandbox environment Customizable monitor check timeout Custom provided modules for scripted monitor types Kubernetes-specific features Also, the CPM delivers the following features in a Kubernetes environment: Integrates with the Kubernetes API to delegate runtime lifecycle management to Kubernetes Does not require privileged access to the Docker socket Supports hosted and on-premise Kubernetes clusters Supports various container engines such as Docker and Containerd Deployable via Helm charts as well as configuration YAMLs Allows job (ping vs. non-ping checks) based resource allocation for optimum resource management Observability offered via the New Relic One Kubernetes cluster explorer System requirements and compatibility To host CPMs, your system must meet the minimum requirements for the chosen system environment. Caution Do not modify any CPM files. New Relic is not liable for any modifications you make. For more information, contact your account representative or a New Relic technical sales rep. Docker container system environment requirements Compatibility for Requirements Operating system Linux kernel: 3.10 or higher. macOS: 10.11 or higher. Windows: Windows 10 64-bit or higher. You must also configure Docker to run Linux containers in order for CPMs to work on Windows systems. Processor A modern, multi-core CPU Memory 2.5 GiB of RAM per CPU core (dedicated) Disk space A minimum of 10 GB per host Docker version Docker 17.12.1-ce or higher Private location key You must have a private location key Caution The Docker CPM is not designed for use with container orchestrators like AWS ECS, Docker Swarm, Apache Mesos, Azure Container Instances, etc. Running the Docker CPM in a container orchestrator will result in unexpected issues because it is itself a container orchestrator. If you're using container orchestration, see our Kubernetes CPM requirements. Kubernetes container orchestration system environment requirements (CPM v3.0.0 or higher) Compatibility for Requirements Operating system Linux kernel: 3.10 or higher macOS: 10.11 or higher Windows: Windows 10 64-bit or higher Processor A modern, multi-core CPU Minion pod CPU (vCPU/Core): 0.5 up to 0.75 Memory: 800 Mi up to 1.6 Gi Resources allocated to a Minion pod are user configurable. Runner pod CPU (vCPU/Core): 0.5 up to 1 Memory: 1.25 Gi up to 3 Gi For a scripted API check, 1.25 Gi will be requested with a limit of 2.5 Gi. For a simple browser or scripted browser check, 2 Gi will be requested with a limit of 3 Gi. Additional considerations: Resources allocated to a runner pod are not user configurable. The maximum limit-request resource ratio for both CPU and memory is 2. Disk space Persistent volume (PV) of at least 10 Gi in size Note that if a ReadWriteOnce (RWO) PV is provided to the minion, an implicit node affinity will be established to ensure the minion and the runner containers are scheduled on the same node. This is required to allow the minion and the associated runners access to the PV, as an RWO PV can be accessed only by a single node in the cluster. Kubernetes version We recommend that your Kubernetes cluster supports Kubernetes v1.15. Caution We have identified a compatibility issue with Kubernetes v1.21+. A workaround is available by disabling the BoundServiceAccountTokenVolume feature gate on the cluster. Private location key You must have a private location key Helm Follow installation instructions for Helm v3 for your OS. Kubectl Follow installation instructions for Kubectl for your OS. To view versions, dependencies, default values for how many runner pods start with each minion, the Persistent volume access mode, and more, please see Show help and examples below. Private location key Before launching CPMs, you must have a private location key. Your CPM uses the key to authenticate against New Relic and run monitors associated with that private location. To find the key for existing private location: Go to one.newrelic.com > Synthetics > Private locations. In the Private locations index, locate the private location you want your CPM to be assigned to. Note the key associated with the private location with the key icon. Sandboxing and Docker dependencies Sandboxing and Docker dependencies are applicable to the CPM in a Docker container system environment. Docker dependencies The CPM runs in Docker and is able to leverage Docker as a sandboxing technology. This ensures complete isolation of the monitor execution, which improves security, reliability, and repeatability. Every time a scripted or browser monitor is executed, the CPM creates a brand new Docker container to run it in called a runner. The minion container needs to be configured to communicate with the Docker engine in order to spawn additional runner containers. Each spawned container is then dedicated to run a check associated with the synthetic monitor running on the private location the minion container is associated with. There are two crucial dependencies at launch. To enable sandboxing, ensure that: Your writable and executable directory is mounted at /tmp. The writable directory can be any directory you want the CPM to write into, but New Relic recommends the system's own /tmp to make things easy. Your writable Docker UNIX socket is mounted at /var/run/docker.sock or DOCKER_HOST environment variable. For more information, see Docker's Daemon socket option. Caution Core count on the host determines how many runner containers the CPM can run concurrently on the host. Since memory requirements are scaled to the expected count of runner containers, we recommend not running multiple CPMs on the same host to avoid resource contention. For additional information on sandboxing and running as a root or non-root user, see Security, sandboxing, and running as non-root. Install and update CPM versions Both installing and updating the CPM use the same command to pull the latest Docker image from the Quay.io repository where the CPM Docker image is hosted. Go to quay.io/repository/newrelic/synthetics-minion for a list of all the releases. CPM images are also hosted on Docker Hub. Go to hub.docker.com/r/newrelic/synthetics-minion/tags for a list of all the releases. Unless hosting the images in a local image repository, connections to either quay.io or docker.io will need to be allowed through your firewall in order for Docker to pull the synthetics-minion and synthetics-minion-runner images. The \"runner\" image is pulled automatically on startup of the synthetics-minion container. See Docker environment configuration and Kubernetes environment configuration for details on how to set a local repository and the runner registry endpoint. Start the CPM To start the CPM, follow the applicable Docker or Kubernetes instructions. Docker start procedure Locate your private location key. Ensure you've enabled Docker dependencies for sandboxing and installed CPM on your system. Run the appropriate script for your system. Tailor the common defaults for /tmp and /var/run/docker.sock in the following examples to match your system. Linux/macOS: docker run \\ --name YOUR_CONTAINER_NAME \\ -e \"MINION_PRIVATE_LOCATION_KEY=YOUR_PRIVATE_LOCATION_KEY\" \\ -v /tmp:/tmp:rw \\ -v /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock:rw \\ -d \\ --restart unless-stopped \\ quay.io/newrelic/synthetics-minion:latest Copy Windows: docker run ^ --name YOUR_CONTAINER_NAME ^ -e \"MINION_PRIVATE_LOCATION_KEY=YOUR_PRIVATE_LOCATION_KEY\" ^ -v /tmp:/tmp:rw ^ -v /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock:rw ^ -d ^ --restart unless-stopped ^ quay.io/newrelic/synthetics-minion:latest Copy View the logs for your minion container: docker logs --follow YOUR_CONTAINER_NAME Copy When a message similar to Synthetics Minion is ready and servicing location YOUR_PRIVATE_LOCATION_LABEL appears, your CPM is up and ready to run monitors assigned to that location. Kubernetes start procedure Locate your private location key. Set up the a namespace for the CPM in your Kubernetes cluster: kubectl create namespace YOUR_NAMESPACE Copy Copy the Helm charts from the New Relic Helm repo. If you are copying the charts for the first time: helm repo add YOUR_REPO_NAME https://helm-charts.newrelic.com Copy If you previously copied the Helm charts from the New Relic Helm repo, then get the latest: helm repo update Copy Install the CPM with the following Helm command: For a fresh installation of the CPM: helm install YOUR_CPM_NAME YOUR_REPO_NAME/synthetics-minion -n YOUR_NAMESPACE --set synthetics.privateLocationKey=YOUR_PRIVATE_LOCATION_KEY Copy To update an existing CPM installation: helm upgrade YOUR_CPM_NAME YOUR_REPO_NAME/synthetics-minion -n YOUR_NAMESPACE --set synthetics.privateLocationKey=YOUR_PRIVATE_LOCATION_KEY Copy Check if the minion pod is up and running: kubectl get -n YOUR_NAMESPACE pods Copy Once the status attribute of each pod is shown as running, your CPM is up and ready to run monitors assigned to your private location. Stop or delete the CPM On a Docker container system environment, use the Docker stop procedure to stop the CPM from running. On a Kubernetes container orchestration system environment, use the Kubernetes delete procedure to stop the CPM from running. Docker stop procedure You can stop a Docker container either by the container name, or the container ID. Container name stop for Linux, macOS, and Windows: docker stop YOUR_CONTAINER_NAME docker rm YOUR_CONTAINER_NAME Copy Container ID stop for Linux/macOS: In the examples the container is stopped and removed. To only stop the container, omit docker rm $CONTAINER_ID. CONTAINER_ID=$(docker ps -aqf name=YOUR_CONTAINER_NAME) docker stop $CONTAINER_ID docker rm $CONTAINER_ID Copy Container ID stop for Windows: In the examples the container is stopped and removed. To only stop the container, omit docker rm $CONTAINER_ID. FOR /F \"tokens=*\" %%CID IN ('docker ps -aqf name=YOUR_CONTAINER_NAME') do (SET CONTAINER_ID=%%CID) docker stop %CONTAINER_ID% docker rm %CONTAINER_ID% Copy Kubernetes delete procedure Get the MINION_POD_INSTALLATION_NAME of the minion pod you want to delete: helm list -n YOUR_NAMESPACE Copy Delete the minion pod: helm uninstall -n YOUR_NAMESPACE MINION_POD_INSTALLATION_NAME Copy Delete the namespace set up for the CPM in your Kubernetes cluster: kubectl delete namespace YOUR_NAMESPACE Copy Show help and examples Use these options as applicable: To get a list of the most commonly used run options directly in the command line interface, run the show help command. To show CPM usage examples as well as the list of all the available run options, run this command: docker run quay.io/newrelic/synthetics-minion:latest help Copy To keep track of Docker logs and verify the health of your monitors, see Containerized private minion (CPM) maintenance and monitoring. For a CPM in the Kubernetes container orchestration system environment, the following Helm show commands can be used to view the chart.yaml and the values.yaml, respectively: helm show chart YOUR_REPO_NAME/synthetics-minion Copy helm show values YOUR_REPO_NAME/synthetics-minion Copy Show license information To show the licensing information for the open source software that we use in the CPM, run the LICENSE command. Run this command to view license information for CPM versions 2.2.27 or higher: docker run quay.io/newrelic/synthetics-minion:latest LICENSE Copy Some of our open-source software is listed under multiple software licenses, and in that case we have listed the license we've chosen to use. Our license information is also available in the our licenses documentation. Configure CPM You can configure the containerized private minion with custom npm modules, preserve data between launches, use environment variables, and more. For more information, see CPM configuration. Networks For both Docker and Kubernetes, the CPM and its runner containers will inherit network settings from the host. For an example of this on a Docker container system environment, see the Docker site. A new bridge network is created for each runner container. This means networking command options like --network and --dns passed to the CPM container at launch (such as through Docker run commands on a Docker container system environment) are not inherited or used by the runner containers. When these networks are created, they pull from the default IP address pool configured for daemon. For an example of this on a Docker container system environment, see the Docker site. Typically, the runner network is removed after the check is completed. However, if a CPM exits while a check is still running, or exits in another unexpected circumstance, these networks may get orphaned. This can potentially use up IP address space that is available to the Docker daemon. If this happens, you may see INTERNAL ENGINE ERROR code: 31 entries in your CPM logging when trying to create a new runner container. To clean these up in Docker container system environments only, run docker network prune. Security, sandboxing, and running as non-root By default, the software running inside a CPM is executed with root user privileges. This is suitable for most scenarios, as the execution is sandboxed. In a Docker container system environment: To change the default AppArmor profile used by containers that CPM spawns to run monitors, see the environment variable MINION_RUNNER_APPARMOR (CPM version 3.0.3 or higher) or MINION_DOCKER_RUNNER_APPARMOR (CPM version up to v3.0.2). To run the CPM as a non-root user, additional steps are required: Run as non-root user for Docker For more information, see Docker's official documentation about security and AppArmor security profiles. If your environment requires you to run the CPM as a non-root user, follow this procedure. In the following example, the non-root user is my_user. Ensure that my_user can use the Docker engine on the host: Verify that my_user belongs to the \"docker\" system group. OR Enable the Docker TCP socket option, and pass the DOCKER_HOST environment variable to CPM. Verify that my_user has read/write permissions to all the directories and volumes passed to CPM. To set these permission, use the chmod command. Get the uid of my_user for use in the run command: id -u my_user. Once these conditions are met, use the option \"-u <uid>:<gid>\" when launching CPM: docker run ... -u 1002 ... Copy OR docker run ... -u 1002 -e DOCKER_HOST=http://localhost:2375 ... Copy Docker image repository A single CPM Docker image serves both the Docker container system environment and Kubernetes container orchestration system environment. The Docker image is hosted on quay.io. To make sure your Docker image is up-to-date, see the quay.io newrelic/synthetics-minion repository. Additional considerations for CPM connection Connection Description CPMs without Internet access A CPM can operate without access to the internet, but with some exceptions. The public internet health check can be disabled using the environment variables named MINION_NETWORK_HEALTHCHECK_DISABLED for a Docker container system environment or synthetics.minionNetworkHealthCheckDisabled for a Kubernetes container orchestration system environment. The CPM needs to be able to contact the \"synthetics-horde.nr-data.net\" domain. This is necessary for it to report data to New Relic and to receive monitors to execute. Ask your network administration if this is a problem and how to set up exceptions. Communicate with Synthetics via a proxy To set up communication with New Relic by proxy, use the environment variables named MINION_API_PROXY*. Arguments passed at launch This applies to a Docker container environment only. Arguments passed to the CPM container at launch do not get passed on to the containers spawned by the CPM. Docker has no concept of \"inheritance\" or a \"hierarchy\" of containers, and we don't copy the configuration that is passed from CPM to the monitor-running containers. The only shared configuration between them is the one set at the Docker daemon level.",

General private minion features Because the CPM operates as a container instead of a virtual machine, it delivers many features: Easy to install, start, and update Runs on: Linux macOS Windows Enhanced security and support for non-root user execution Ability to leverage a Docker container as a sandbox environment Customizable monitor check timeout Custom provided modules for scripted monitor types Kubernetes-specific features Also, the CPM delivers the following features in a Kubernetes environment: Integrates with the Kubernetes API to delegate runtime lifecycle management to Kubernetes Does not require privileged access to the Docker socket Supports hosted and on-premise Kubernetes clusters Supports various container engines such as Docker and Containerd Deployable via Helm charts as well as configuration YAMLs Allows job (ping vs. non-ping checks) based resource allocation for optimum resource management Observability offered via the New Relic One Kubernetes cluster explorer System requirements and compatibility To host CPMs, your system must meet the minimum requirements for the chosen system environment. Caution Do not modify any CPM files. New Relic is not liable for any modifications you make. For more information, contact your account representative or a New Relic technical sales rep. Docker container system environment requirements Compatibility for Requirements Operating system Linux kernel: 3.10 or higher. macOS: 10.11 or higher. Windows: Windows 10 64-bit or higher. You must also configure Docker to run Linux containers in order for CPMs to work on Windows systems. Processor A modern, multi-core CPU Memory 2.5 GiB of RAM per CPU core (dedicated) Disk space A minimum of 10 GB per host Docker version Docker 17.12.1-ce or higher Private location key You must have a private location key Caution The Docker CPM is not designed for use with container orchestrators like AWS ECS, Docker Swarm, Apache Mesos, Azure Container Instances, etc. Running the Docker CPM in a container orchestrator will result in unexpected issues because it is itself a container orchestrator. If you're using container orchestration, see our Kubernetes CPM requirements. Kubernetes container orchestration system environment requirements (CPM v3.0.0 or higher) Compatibility for Requirements Operating system Linux kernel: 3.10 or higher macOS: 10.11 or higher Windows: Windows 10 64-bit or higher Processor A modern, multi-core CPU Minion pod CPU (vCPU/Core): 0.5 up to 0.75 Memory: 800 Mi up to 1.6 Gi Resources allocated to a Minion pod are user configurable. Runner pod CPU (vCPU/Core): 0.5 up to 1 Memory: 1.25 Gi up to 3 Gi For a scripted API check, 1.25 Gi will be requested with a limit of 2.5 Gi. For a simple browser or scripted browser check, 2 Gi will be requested with a limit of 3 Gi. Additional considerations: Resources allocated to a runner pod are not user configurable. The maximum limit-request resource ratio for both CPU and memory is 2. Disk space Persistent volume (PV) of at least 10 Gi in size Note that if a ReadWriteOnce (RWO) PV is provided to the minion, an implicit node affinity will be established to ensure the minion and the runner containers are scheduled on the same node. This is required to allow the minion and the associated runners access to the PV, as an RWO PV can be accessed only by a single node in the cluster. Kubernetes version We recommend that your Kubernetes cluster supports Kubernetes v1.15. Caution We have identified a compatibility issue with Kubernetes v1.21+. A workaround is available by disabling the BoundServiceAccountTokenVolume feature gate on the cluster. Private location key You must have a private location key Helm Follow installation instructions for Helm v3 for your OS. Kubectl Follow installation instructions for Kubectl for your OS. To view versions, dependencies, default values for how many runner pods start with each minion, the Persistent volume access mode, and more, please see Show help and examples below. Private location key Before launching CPMs, you must have a private location key. Your CPM uses the key to authenticate against New Relic and run monitors associated with that private location. To find the key for existing private location: Go to one.newrelic.com > Synthetics > Private locations. In the Private locations index, locate the private location you want your CPM to be assigned to. Note the key associated with the private location with the key icon. Sandboxing and Docker dependencies Sandboxing and Docker dependencies are applicable to the CPM in a Docker container system environment. Docker dependencies The CPM runs in Docker and is able to leverage Docker as a sandboxing technology. This ensures complete isolation of the monitor execution, which improves security, reliability, and repeatability. Every time a scripted or browser monitor is executed, the CPM creates a brand new Docker container to run it in called a runner. The minion container needs to be configured to communicate with the Docker engine in order to spawn additional runner containers. Each spawned container is then dedicated to run a check associated with the synthetic monitor running on the private location the minion container is associated with. There are two crucial dependencies at launch. To enable sandboxing, ensure that: Your writable and executable directory is mounted at /tmp. The writable directory can be any directory you want the CPM to write into, but New Relic recommends the system's own /tmp to make things easy. Your writable Docker UNIX socket is mounted at /var/run/docker.sock or DOCKER_HOST environment variable. For more information, see Docker's Daemon socket option. Caution Core count on the host determines how many runner containers the CPM can run concurrently on the host. Since memory requirements are scaled to the expected count of runner containers, we recommend not running multiple CPMs on the same host to avoid resource contention. For additional information on sandboxing and running as a root or non-root user, see Security, sandboxing, and running as non-root. Install and update CPM versions Both installing and updating the CPM use the same command to pull the latest Docker image from the Quay.io repository where the CPM Docker image is hosted. Go to quay.io/repository/newrelic/synthetics-minion for a list of all the releases. CPM images are also hosted on Docker Hub. Go to hub.docker.com/r/newrelic/synthetics-minion/tags for a list of all the releases. Unless hosting the images in a local image repository, connections to either quay.io or docker.io will need to be allowed through your firewall in order for Docker to pull the synthetics-minion and synthetics-minion-runner images. The \"runner\" image is pulled automatically on startup of the synthetics-minion container. See Docker environment configuration and Kubernetes environment configuration for details on how to set a local repository and the runner registry endpoint. Start the CPM To start the CPM, follow the applicable Docker or Kubernetes instructions. Docker start procedure Locate your private location key. Ensure you've enabled Docker dependencies for sandboxing and installed CPM on your system. Run the appropriate script for your system. Tailor the common defaults for /tmp and /var/run/docker.sock in the following examples to match your system. Linux/macOS: docker run \\ --name YOUR_CONTAINER_NAME \\ -e \"MINION_PRIVATE_LOCATION_KEY=YOUR_PRIVATE_LOCATION_KEY\" \\ -v /tmp:/tmp:rw \\ -v /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock:rw \\ -d \\ --restart unless-stopped \\ quay.io/newrelic/synthetics-minion:latest Copy Windows: docker run ^ --name YOUR_CONTAINER_NAME ^ -e \"MINION_PRIVATE_LOCATION_KEY=YOUR_PRIVATE_LOCATION_KEY\" ^ -v /tmp:/tmp:rw ^ -v /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock:rw ^ -d ^ --restart unless-stopped ^ quay.io/newrelic/synthetics-minion:latest Copy View the logs for your minion container: docker logs --follow YOUR_CONTAINER_NAME Copy When a message similar to Synthetics Minion is ready and servicing location YOUR_PRIVATE_LOCATION_LABEL appears, your CPM is up and ready to run monitors assigned to that location. Kubernetes start procedure Locate your private location key. Set up the a namespace for the CPM in your Kubernetes cluster: kubectl create namespace YOUR_NAMESPACE Copy Copy the Helm charts from the New Relic Helm repo. If you are copying the charts for the first time: helm repo add YOUR_REPO_NAME https://helm-charts.newrelic.com Copy If you previously copied the Helm charts from the New Relic Helm repo, then get the latest: helm repo update Copy Install the CPM with the following Helm command: For a fresh installation of the CPM: helm install YOUR_CPM_NAME YOUR_REPO_NAME/synthetics-minion -n YOUR_NAMESPACE --set synthetics.privateLocationKey=YOUR_PRIVATE_LOCATION_KEY Copy To update an existing CPM installation: helm upgrade YOUR_CPM_NAME YOUR_REPO_NAME/synthetics-minion -n YOUR_NAMESPACE --set synthetics.privateLocationKey=YOUR_PRIVATE_LOCATION_KEY Copy Check if the minion pod is up and running: kubectl get -n YOUR_NAMESPACE pods Copy Once the status attribute of each pod is shown as running, your CPM is up and ready to run monitors assigned to your private location. Stop or delete the CPM On a Docker container system environment, use the Docker stop procedure to stop the CPM from running. On a Kubernetes container orchestration system environment, use the Kubernetes delete procedure to stop the CPM from running. Docker stop procedure You can stop a Docker container either by the container name, or the container ID. Container name stop for Linux, macOS, and Windows: docker stop YOUR_CONTAINER_NAME docker rm YOUR_CONTAINER_NAME Copy Container ID stop for Linux/macOS: In the examples the container is stopped and removed. To only stop the container, omit docker rm $CONTAINER_ID. CONTAINER_ID=$(docker ps -aqf name=YOUR_CONTAINER_NAME) docker stop $CONTAINER_ID docker rm $CONTAINER_ID Copy Container ID stop for Windows: In the examples the container is stopped and removed. To only stop the container, omit docker rm $CONTAINER_ID. FOR /F \"tokens=*\" %%CID IN ('docker ps -aqf name=YOUR_CONTAINER_NAME') do (SET CONTAINER_ID=%%CID) docker stop %CONTAINER_ID% docker rm %CONTAINER_ID% Copy Kubernetes delete procedure Get the MINION_POD_INSTALLATION_NAME of the minion pod you want to delete: helm list -n YOUR_NAMESPACE Copy Delete the minion pod: helm uninstall -n YOUR_NAMESPACE MINION_POD_INSTALLATION_NAME Copy Delete the namespace set up for the CPM in your Kubernetes cluster: kubectl delete namespace YOUR_NAMESPACE Copy Show help and examples Use these options as applicable: To get a list of the most commonly used run options directly in the command line interface, run the show help command. To show CPM usage examples as well as the list of all the available run options, run this command: docker run quay.io/newrelic/synthetics-minion:latest help Copy To keep track of Docker logs and verify the health of your monitors, see Containerized private minion (CPM) maintenance and monitoring. For a CPM in the Kubernetes container orchestration system environment, the following Helm show commands can be used to view the chart.yaml and the values.yaml, respectively: helm show chart YOUR_REPO_NAME/synthetics-minion Copy helm show values YOUR_REPO_NAME/synthetics-minion Copy Show license information To show the licensing information for the open source software that we use in the CPM, run the LICENSE command. Run this command to view license information for CPM versions 2.2.27 or higher: docker run quay.io/newrelic/synthetics-minion:latest LICENSE Copy Some of our open-source software is listed under multiple software licenses, and in that case we have listed the license we've chosen to use. Our license information is also available in the our licenses documentation. Configure CPM You can configure the containerized private minion with custom npm modules, preserve data between launches, use environment variables, and more. For more information, see CPM configuration. Networks For both Docker and Kubernetes, the CPM and its runner containers will inherit network settings from the host. For an example of this on a Docker container system environment, see the Docker site. A new bridge network is created for each runner container. This means networking command options like --network and --dns passed to the CPM container at launch (such as through Docker run commands on a Docker container system environment) are not inherited or used by the runner containers. When these networks are created, they pull from the default IP address pool configured for daemon. For an example of this on a Docker container system environment, see the Docker site. Typically, the runner network is removed after the check is completed. However, if a CPM exits while a check is still running, or exits in another unexpected circumstance, these networks may get orphaned. This can potentially use up IP address space that is available to the Docker daemon. If this happens, you may see INTERNAL ENGINE ERROR code: 31 entries in your CPM logging when trying to create a new runner container. To clean these up in Docker container system environments only, run docker network prune. Security, sandboxing, and running as non-root By default, the software running inside a CPM is executed with root user privileges. This is suitable for most scenarios, as the execution is sandboxed. In a Docker container system environment: To change the default AppArmor profile used by containers that CPM spawns to run monitors, see the environment variable MINION_RUNNER_APPARMOR (CPM version 3.0.3 or higher) or MINION_DOCKER_RUNNER_APPARMOR (CPM version up to v3.0.2). To run the CPM as a non-root user, additional steps are required: Run as non-root user for Docker For more information, see Docker's official documentation about security and AppArmor security profiles. If your environment requires you to run the CPM as a non-root user, follow this procedure. In the following example, the non-root user is my_user. Ensure that my_user can use the Docker engine on the host: Verify that my_user belongs to the \"docker\" system group. OR Enable the Docker TCP socket option, and pass the DOCKER_HOST environment variable to CPM. Verify that my_user has read/write permissions to all the directories and volumes passed to CPM. To set these permission, use the chmod command. Get the uid of my_user for use in the run command: id -u my_user. Once these conditions are met, use the option \"-u <uid>:<gid>\" when launching CPM: docker run ... -u 1002 ... Copy OR docker run ... -u 1002 -e DOCKER_HOST=http://localhost:2375 ... Copy Docker image repository A single CPM Docker image serves both the Docker container system environment and Kubernetes container orchestration system environment. The Docker image is hosted on quay.io. To make sure your Docker image is up-to-date, see the quay.io newrelic/synthetics-minion repository. Additional considerations for CPM connection Connection Description CPMs without Internet access A CPM can operate without access to the internet, but with some exceptions. The public internet health check can be disabled using the environment variables named MINION_NETWORK_HEALTHCHECK_DISABLED for a Docker container system environment or synthetics.minionNetworkHealthCheckDisabled for a Kubernetes container orchestration system environment. The CPM needs to be able to contact the \"synthetics-horde.nr-data.net\" domain. This is necessary for it to report data to New Relic and to receive monitors to execute. Ask your network administration if this is a problem and how to set up exceptions. Communicate with Synthetics via a proxy To set up communication with New Relic by proxy, use the environment variables named MINION_API_PROXY*. Arguments passed at launch This applies to a Docker container environment only. Arguments passed to the CPM container at launch do not get passed on to the containers spawned by the CPM. Docker has no concept of \"inheritance\" or a \"hierarchy\" of containers, and we don't copy the configuration that is passed from CPM to the monitor-running containers. The only shared configuration between them is the one set at the Docker daemon level.",

      "body": "You can use secure credentials with synthetic monitoring to store critical information, such as passwords, API keys, usernames, etc. This prevents scripted monitor users from viewing, updating, or deleting these values unless they have explicit permissions in New Relic. The credentials are securely stored using AES-GCM 256-bit encryption at rest with keys managed by Amazon AWS Key Management Service (KMS). You can set secure credentials in New Relic One or with the API. Requirements and limits Before using secure credentials, review these requirements and guidelines: Secure credentials Comments Applicable monitors The secure credentials feature is available only for synthetic scripted browsers and API test monitors. Permissions Account administrators can control which users can create, view, or delete secure credentials by managing users' permissions. Limit You can have a maximum of 1,000 secure credentials. Add or update secure credentials You can add or update secure credentials using the UI or the Synthetics REST API. To add, view, edit, or delete a secure credential for a scripted browser or API test monitor from the UI: Go to one.newrelic.com > Synthetics > Secure credentials. To add a new secure credential, look for the Create secure credential + button. If you have credentials already added, this button is at the top right. Tips for creating the Key: choose a username or other meaningful key name to identify the secure credential. Use alphanumeric or underscore _ characters. Key names must be UPPERCASE. Tips for creating the Value: Use any combination of alphanumeric or special characters. 10000 characters maximum. This field is not accessible via the API. To edit an existing credential, click the ellipsis icon for options. Associate the secure credential with a scripted browser or API test by editing the script. After you add the secure credential to the script, the Secure credentials UI shows how many scripted monitors use that credential. This number is approximate and only updates after a monitor with a secure credential has actually been run. Update the script When using the Synthetics UI editor to create scripted browsers or API test monitors, follow these guidelines: Script Guidelines Format Anywhere in the script where you reference the secure credential, it is accessed via the reserved New Relic $secure JavaScript object with dot notation. For example, $secure.MY_SECURE_CREDENTIAL. Properties on $secure are not accessible through bracket notation. Existing credentials To view or select from a list of available secure credentials: Type $secure. OR Select from the dropdown in the editor UI. Validation To validate the secure credential, follow standard procedures to test the script or write an API test. Any changes to the secure credential's value will automatically take effect across all monitors that use it. You do not need to also update the script. Exception: If you update the script and jobs are already processing, the secure credential change will not take effect until the next time the job begins. Security for secure credentials To ensure the security of your secure credentials, New Relic scrubs the secure value out of all data that goes to results in synthetic monitoring data and alerts. New Relic employees cannot access secure credential values and must be added to the account to be able to view secure credentials. Example A secure credential is named PASSWORD and the value is Pass123!. New Relic replaces Pass123! with _SECURECREDENTIAL_ For example, a script includes: $browser.get(\"https://example.com/\" + $secure.PASSWORD) Copy The script results will show that New Relic Synthetics went to https://example.com/_SECURECREDENTIAL_, even though it actually went to https://example.com/Pass123!. This ensures the value of the secure credential will not appear in the results. Redacted information We currently redact the following from the results of your monitor: The exact values of your secure credentials Any percent-encoded values of your secure credentials",

      "body": "Synthetic monitors are API checks or virtual browser instances that monitor your website, recording each check in detail. They can also: Capture aggregate numbers, including an overview or summary for ping monitors. Provide detailed statistics for each page resource, and downtime incidents. Collect custom response codes for more detail on your monitor runs. You'll be able to add and configure synthetic monitors to suit your environnment after you create a New Relic account. (It's free, forever!) Add a monitor You can add several types of synthetic monitors: Ping monitors ensure your website is responding, while simple browser monitors send real browsers to check your website. For more complex monitoring, scripted browser monitors verify that specific resources are present, while API tests verify your API endpoint. The default timeout for a new monitor is 180 seconds. Add a ping or simple browser monitor Go to one.newrelic.com > Synthetics > Create monitor. Specify a monitor type, name, and URL (may be any valid HTTP or HTTPS URL). Optional: Add a validation string or Advanced options: A validation string is available for ping and simple browser. This option enables substring monitoring for response validation. Verify SSL is available for ping and simple browser. This option verifies the validity of the SSL certificate chain. It can be duplicated by running the following syntax: openssl s_client -servername {YOUR_HOSTNAME} -connect {YOUR_HOSTNAME}:443 -CApath /etc/ssl/certs -verify_hostname {YOUR_HOSTNAME} > /dev/null Copy If a non-zero exit code is returned, the monitor will fail. The Bypass HEAD request option is available for ping. This option skips the default HEAD request and instead uses the GET verb with a ping check. Redirect is Failure is available for ping. If a redirect result occurs when Redirect is Failure is enabled, New Relic Synthetics will categorize the result as a failure, rather than following the redirect and checking the resulting URL. Select the locations from which you want your monitor to run. Choose a frequency to determine how often each location will run your monitor. Optional: Set up alert notifications. Select Create my monitor to confirm. Generate some traffic and wait a few minutes, then check your monitor from the Monitors index. Add a scripted browser or API test monitor Go to one.newrelic.com > Synthetics > Create monitor. Specify a monitor type and name. Select the locations from which you want your monitor to run. Choose a frequency to determine how often each location will run your monitor. Optional: Set up alert notifications. Select Next: Write your script to create a script for your scripted browser or API test, then select Validate to verify your syntax. Tip For complex scripts, validation may take up to one minute. Select Create my monitor to confirm. Generate some traffic and wait a few minutes, then check your monitor from the Monitors index. Add a step monitor Go to one.newrelic.com > Synthetics > Create monitor. Select step monitor as the monitor type. Specify a name and choose a frequency to determine how often each location will run your monitor. Select the locations from which you want your monitor to run. Build your monitor by selecting from the preconfigured steps at the bottom of the UI: Navigate to a URL Type text Click an element Assert text Assert an element Secure a credential Use the instructions on the right side of the UI to help locate elements by CSS class, HTML ID, link text, or XPath. Select Save monitor to confirm. Generate some traffic and wait a few minutes, then check your monitor from the Monitors index. Add a certificate check monitor Go to one.newrelic.com > Synthetics > Create monitor. Select the certificate check monitor type. Specify a name and enter the domain you'd like to monitor. Enter the number of days it takes for your certificate to expire. Select the period to determine your monitor's frequency. Optional: Add tags to help you find this monitor later. Select the locations from which you want your monitor to run, and then click Save monitor to confirm. Generate some traffic and wait a few minutes, then check your monitor from the Monitors index. Add a broken links monitor Go to one.newrelic.com > Synthetics > Create monitor. Select the broken links check monitor type. Specify a name and enter the URL you'd like to monitor (may be any valid HTTP or HTTPS URL). Select the period to determine your monitor's frequency. Optional: Add tags to help you find this monitor later. Select the locations from which you want your monitor to run, and then click Save monitor to confirm. Generate some traffic and wait a few minutes, then check your monitor from the Monitors index. Tip You can also add monitors with the Synthetics REST API. For example, you can create a GET request to the monitor you want to use as the source for configuration, then use those key values to use in a POST to \"copy\" and create a new monitor. Edit a monitor You cannot change a monitor's type after the monitor is created, but you can edit other monitor settings. From the Monitors tab in one.newrelic.com > Synthetics, select the monitor you want to edit. In the side menu, select a link to change the following settings: Select Settings > General to edit name, Apdex T, URL, locations, frequency, and advanced options. For Scripted browser and API test monitors, select Settings > Script to edit your monitor script. For synthetic monitoring alerts, click Manage alerts. Select Save changes to confirm. Delete a monitor To delete a monitor: From the Monitors tab in one.newrelic.com > Synthetics, select the monitor you want to edit. From the selected monitor, select Settings > General. Scroll to the bottom of the page and select the trash can icon. Tip You can also delete a monitor with the Synthetics REST API. Monitor settings When configuring monitors, the following settings are available: Type Select the type of monitor you want to create. A monitor's type can't be changed after the monitor is created. Ping: Specify a single URL to monitor for availability. New Relic will check this URL via HEAD or GET requests. The non-configurable timeout for this monitor is 60 seconds. Simple browser: Specify a single URL to monitor via real browser. Once each frequency interval, New Relic will check this URL via a Selenium-powered Google Chrome browser. The non-configurable timeout for this monitor is 60 seconds. Scripted browser: Create a script to drive a Selenium-powered Google Chrome browser. The browser follows each step in the script to verify that complex behavior is working as expected (for example, searching a website, then clicking one of the search results). The non-configurable timeout for this monitor is 180 seconds. API test: Create an API script to ensure your API endpoint is working correctly. For more information, see Write API tests. The non-configurable timeout for this monitor is 180 seconds. Monitor name Defines a name for the monitor. Monitor names cannot contain unencoded angle brackets (< >). To include angle brackets in a monitor name, encode them as HTML bracket entities (&lt; &gt;) in the UI or API. Location Select the locations where you want your monitor to run. Select more locations to ensure that your application is available to users around the world. If you have any private locations, they will be listed here too. You can use the Synthetics API location endpoint to retrieve a list of valid locations for your account. Your monitor will run one check from each selected location during each frequency interval. For example, if you select three locations and define a frequency of 15 minutes, your monitor will run three checks in each 15 minute period (or 8,640 checks per month). Frequency Select how often the monitor runs, in increments of minutes, hours, or 1 day. This frequency applies to each location. For example, if you select three locations and a Frequency of 15 minutes, your monitor will run three checks, on average every 5 minutes, in each 15 minute period (or 8,640 checks per month). Alerts Specify an email address to receive alerts when a monitor fails. Or, attach a monitor to an existing alert policy for more notification options. For more information, see Alerting for synthetic monitoring. Apdex T Customize the Apdex T for this monitor. This setting is only available when editing the settings for an existing monitor, not when creating a new monitor. Change the Apdex T from the default 7 seconds for more accurate Apdex scores in your SLA reports. For example, if you have a very long scripted browser, you might adjust the Apdex T to 15 seconds to more closely reflect the usual completion time. Similarly, a good Apdex T for a simple browser check might be only 2 seconds. Response Validation (optional) Specify text to search for on the page. When using simple browser or ping monitor types, there is a 1MB (10^6 bytes) limit on the page load.

      "body": "Synthetic monitors are API checks or virtual browser instances that monitor your website, recording each check in detail. They can also: Capture aggregate numbers, including an overview or summary for ping monitors. Provide detailed statistics for each page resource, and downtime incidents. Collect custom response codes for more detail on your monitor runs. You'll be able to add and configure synthetic monitors to suit your environnment after you create a New Relic account. (It's free, forever!) Add a monitor You can add several types of synthetic monitors: Ping monitors ensure your website is responding, while simple browser monitors send real browsers to check your website. For more complex monitoring, scripted browser monitors verify that specific resources are present, while API tests verify your API endpoint. The default timeout for a new monitor is 180 seconds. Add a ping or simple browser monitor Go to one.newrelic.com > Synthetics > Create monitor. Specify a monitor type, name, and URL (may be any valid HTTP or HTTPS URL). Optional: Add a validation string or Advanced options: A validation string is available for ping and simple browser. This option enables substring monitoring for response validation. Verify SSL is available for ping and simple browser. This option verifies the validity of the SSL certificate chain. It can be duplicated by running the following syntax: openssl s_client -servername {YOUR_HOSTNAME} -connect {YOUR_HOSTNAME}:443 -CApath /etc/ssl/certs -verify_hostname {YOUR_HOSTNAME} > /dev/null Copy If a non-zero exit code is returned, the monitor will fail. The Bypass HEAD request option is available for ping. This option skips the default HEAD request and instead uses the GET verb with a ping check. Redirect is Failure is available for ping. If a redirect result occurs when Redirect is Failure is enabled, New Relic Synthetics will categorize the result as a failure, rather than following the redirect and checking the resulting URL. Select the locations from which you want your monitor to run. Choose a frequency to determine how often each location will run your monitor. Optional: Set up alert notifications. Select Create my monitor to confirm. Generate some traffic and wait a few minutes, then check your monitor from the Monitors index. Add a scripted browser or API test monitor Go to one.newrelic.com > Synthetics > Create monitor. Specify a monitor type and name. Select the locations from which you want your monitor to run. Choose a frequency to determine how often each location will run your monitor. Optional: Set up alert notifications. Select Next: Write your script to create a script for your scripted browser or API test, then select Validate to verify your syntax. Tip For complex scripts, validation may take up to one minute. Select Create my monitor to confirm. Generate some traffic and wait a few minutes, then check your monitor from the Monitors index. Add a step monitor Go to one.newrelic.com > Synthetics > Create monitor. Select step monitor as the monitor type. Specify a name and choose a frequency to determine how often each location will run your monitor. Select the locations from which you want your monitor to run. Build your monitor by selecting from the preconfigured steps at the bottom of the UI: Navigate to a URL Type text Click an element Assert text Assert an element Secure a credential Use the instructions on the right side of the UI to help locate elements by CSS class, HTML ID, link text, or XPath. Select Save monitor to confirm. Generate some traffic and wait a few minutes, then check your monitor from the Monitors index. Add a certificate check monitor Go to one.newrelic.com > Synthetics > Create monitor. Select the certificate check monitor type. Specify a name and enter the domain you'd like to monitor. Enter the number of days it takes for your certificate to expire. Select the period to determine your monitor's frequency. Optional: Add tags to help you find this monitor later. Select the locations from which you want your monitor to run, and then click Save monitor to confirm. Generate some traffic and wait a few minutes, then check your monitor from the Monitors index. Add a broken links monitor Go to one.newrelic.com > Synthetics > Create monitor. Select the broken links check monitor type. Specify a name and enter the URL you'd like to monitor (may be any valid HTTP or HTTPS URL). Select the period to determine your monitor's frequency. Optional: Add tags to help you find this monitor later. Select the locations from which you want your monitor to run, and then click Save monitor to confirm. Generate some traffic and wait a few minutes, then check your monitor from the Monitors index. Tip You can also add monitors with the Synthetics REST API. For example, you can create a GET request to the monitor you want to use as the source for configuration, then use those key values to use in a POST to \"copy\" and create a new monitor. Edit a monitor You cannot change a monitor's type after the monitor is created, but you can edit other monitor settings. From the Monitors tab in one.newrelic.com > Synthetics, select the monitor you want to edit. In the side menu, select a link to change the following settings: Select Settings > General to edit name, Apdex T, URL, locations, frequency, and advanced options. For Scripted browser and API test monitors, select Settings > Script to edit your monitor script. For synthetic monitoring alerts, click Manage alerts. Select Save changes to confirm. Delete a monitor To delete a monitor: From the Monitors tab in one.newrelic.com > Synthetics, select the monitor you want to edit. From the selected monitor, select Settings > General. Scroll to the bottom of the page and select the trash can icon. Tip You can also delete a monitor with the Synthetics REST API. Monitor settings When configuring monitors, the following settings are available: Type Select the type of monitor you want to create. A monitor's type can't be changed after the monitor is created. Ping: Specify a single URL to monitor for availability. New Relic will check this URL via HEAD or GET requests. The non-configurable timeout for this monitor is 60 seconds. Simple browser: Specify a single URL to monitor via real browser. Once each frequency interval, New Relic will check this URL via a Selenium-powered Google Chrome browser. The non-configurable timeout for this monitor is 60 seconds. Scripted browser: Create a script to drive a Selenium-powered Google Chrome browser. The browser follows each step in the script to verify that complex behavior is working as expected (for example, searching a website, then clicking one of the search results). The non-configurable timeout for this monitor is 180 seconds. API test: Create an API script to ensure your API endpoint is working correctly. For more information, see Write API tests. The non-configurable timeout for this monitor is 180 seconds. Monitor name Defines a name for the monitor. Monitor names cannot contain unencoded angle brackets (< >). To include angle brackets in a monitor name, encode them as HTML bracket entities (&lt; &gt;) in the UI or API. Location Select the locations where you want your monitor to run. Select more locations to ensure that your application is available to users around the world. If you have any private locations, they will be listed here too. You can use the Synthetics API location endpoint to retrieve a list of valid locations for your account. Your monitor will run one check from each selected location during each frequency interval. For example, if you select three locations and define a frequency of 15 minutes, your monitor will run three checks in each 15 minute period (or 8,640 checks per month). Frequency Select how often the monitor runs, in increments of minutes, hours, or 1 day. This frequency applies to each location. For example, if you select three locations and a Frequency of 15 minutes, your monitor will run three checks, on average every 5 minutes, in each 15 minute period (or 8,640 checks per month). Alerts Specify an email address to receive alerts when a monitor fails. Or, attach a monitor to an existing alert policy for more notification options. For more information, see Alerting for synthetic monitoring. Apdex T Customize the Apdex T for this monitor. This setting is only available when editing the settings for an existing monitor, not when creating a new monitor. Change the Apdex T from the default 7 seconds for more accurate Apdex scores in your SLA reports. For example, if you have a very long scripted browser, you might adjust the Apdex T to 15 seconds to more closely reflect the usual completion time. Similarly, a good Apdex T for a simple browser check might be only 2 seconds. Response Validation (optional) Specify text to search for on the page. When using simple browser or ping monitor types, there is a 1MB (10^6 bytes) limit on the page load. See a history of monitor changes You can use New Relic One to see a history of recent changes to synthetic monitors and what users changed them.",

For example, you can create a GET request to the monitor you want to use as the source for configuration, then use those key values to use in a POST to \"copy\" and create a new monitor. Edit a monitor You cannot change a monitor's type after the monitor is created, but you can edit other monitor settings. From the Monitors tab in one.newrelic.com > Synthetics, select the monitor you want to edit. In the side menu, select a link to change the following settings: Select Settings > General to edit name, Apdex T, URL, locations, frequency, and advanced options. For Scripted browser and API test monitors, select Settings > Script to edit your monitor script. For synthetic monitoring alerts, click Manage alerts. Select Save changes to confirm. Delete a monitor To delete a monitor: From the Monitors tab in one.newrelic.com > Synthetics, select the monitor you want to edit. From the selected monitor, select Settings > General. Scroll to the bottom of the page and select the trash can icon. Tip You can also delete a monitor with the Synthetics REST API. Monitor settings When configuring monitors, the following settings are available: Type Select the type of monitor you want to create. A monitor's type can't be changed after the monitor is created. Ping: Specify a single URL to monitor for availability. New Relic will check this URL via HEAD or GET requests. The non-configurable timeout for this monitor is 60 seconds. Simple browser: Specify a single URL to monitor via real browser. Once each frequency interval, New Relic will check this URL via a Selenium-powered Google Chrome browser. The non-configurable timeout for this monitor is 60 seconds. Scripted browser: Create a script to drive a Selenium-powered Google Chrome browser. The browser follows each step in the script to verify that complex behavior is working as expected (for example, searching a website, then clicking one of the search results). The non-configurable timeout for this monitor is 180 seconds. API test: Create an API script to ensure your API endpoint is working correctly. For more information, see Write API tests. The non-configurable timeout for this monitor is 180 seconds. Monitor name Defines a name for the monitor. Monitor names cannot contain unencoded angle brackets (< >). To include angle brackets in a monitor name, encode them as HTML bracket entities (&lt; &gt;) in the UI or API. Location Select the locations where you want your monitor to run. Select more locations to ensure that your application is available to users around the world. If you have any private locations, they will be listed here too. You can use the Synthetics API location endpoint to retrieve a list of valid locations for your account. Your monitor will run one check from each selected location during each frequency interval. For example, if you select three locations and define a frequency of 15 minutes, your monitor will run three checks in each 15 minute period (or 8,640 checks per month). Frequency Select how often the monitor runs, in increments of minutes, hours, or 1 day. This frequency applies to each location. For example, if you select three locations and a Frequency of 15 minutes, your monitor will run three checks, on average every 5 minutes, in each 15 minute period (or 8,640 checks per month). Alerts Specify an email address to receive alerts when a monitor fails. Or, attach a monitor to an existing alert policy for more notification options. For more information, see Alerting for synthetic monitoring. Apdex T Customize the Apdex T for this monitor. This setting is only available when editing the settings for an existing monitor, not when creating a new monitor. Change the Apdex T from the default 7 seconds for more accurate Apdex scores in your SLA reports. For example, if you have a very long scripted browser, you might adjust the Apdex T to 15 seconds to more closely reflect the usual completion time. Similarly, a good Apdex T for a simple browser check might be only 2 seconds. Response Validation (optional) Specify text to search for on the page. When using simple browser or ping monitor types, there is a 1MB (10^6 bytes) limit on the page load.

      "body": "Synthetic monitors are API checks or virtual browser instances that monitor your website, recording each check in detail. They can also: Capture aggregate numbers, including an overview or summary for ping monitors. Provide detailed statistics for each page resource, and downtime incidents. Collect custom response codes for more detail on your monitor runs. You'll be able to add and configure synthetic monitors to suit your environnment after you create a New Relic account. (It's free, forever!) Add a monitor You can add several types of synthetic monitors: Ping monitors ensure your website is responding, while simple browser monitors send real browsers to check your website. For more complex monitoring, scripted browser monitors verify that specific resources are present, while API tests verify your API endpoint. The default timeout for a new monitor is 180 seconds. Add a ping or simple browser monitor Go to one.newrelic.com > Synthetics > Create monitor. Specify a monitor type, name, and URL (may be any valid HTTP or HTTPS URL). Optional: Add a validation string or Advanced options: A validation string is available for ping and simple browser. This option enables substring monitoring for response validation. Verify SSL is available for ping and simple browser. This option verifies the validity of the SSL certificate chain. It can be duplicated by running the following syntax: openssl s_client -servername {YOUR_HOSTNAME} -connect {YOUR_HOSTNAME}:443 -CApath /etc/ssl/certs -verify_hostname {YOUR_HOSTNAME} > /dev/null Copy If a non-zero exit code is returned, the monitor will fail. The Bypass HEAD request option is available for ping. This option skips the default HEAD request and instead uses the GET verb with a ping check. Redirect is Failure is available for ping. If a redirect result occurs when Redirect is Failure is enabled, New Relic Synthetics will categorize the result as a failure, rather than following the redirect and checking the resulting URL. Select the locations from which you want your monitor to run. Choose a frequency to determine how often each location will run your monitor. Optional: Set up alert notifications. Select Create my monitor to confirm. Generate some traffic and wait a few minutes, then check your monitor from the Monitors index. Add a scripted browser or API test monitor Go to one.newrelic.com > Synthetics > Create monitor. Specify a monitor type and name. Select the locations from which you want your monitor to run. Choose a frequency to determine how often each location will run your monitor. Optional: Set up alert notifications. Select Next: Write your script to create a script for your scripted browser or API test, then select Validate to verify your syntax. Tip For complex scripts, validation may take up to one minute. Select Create my monitor to confirm. Generate some traffic and wait a few minutes, then check your monitor from the Monitors index. Add a step monitor Go to one.newrelic.com > Synthetics > Create monitor. Select step monitor as the monitor type. Specify a name and choose a frequency to determine how often each location will run your monitor. Select the locations from which you want your monitor to run. Build your monitor by selecting from the preconfigured steps at the bottom of the UI: Navigate to a URL Type text Click an element Assert text Assert an element Secure a credential Use the instructions on the right side of the UI to help locate elements by CSS class, HTML ID, link text, or XPath. Select Save monitor to confirm. Generate some traffic and wait a few minutes, then check your monitor from the Monitors index. Add a certificate check monitor Go to one.newrelic.com > Synthetics > Create monitor. Select the certificate check monitor type. Specify a name and enter the domain you'd like to monitor. Enter the number of days it takes for your certificate to expire. Select the period to determine your monitor's frequency. Optional: Add tags to help you find this monitor later. Select the locations from which you want your monitor to run, and then click Save monitor to confirm. Generate some traffic and wait a few minutes, then check your monitor from the Monitors index. Add a broken links monitor Go to one.newrelic.com > Synthetics > Create monitor. Select the broken links check monitor type. Specify a name and enter the URL you'd like to monitor (may be any valid HTTP or HTTPS URL). Select the period to determine your monitor's frequency. Optional: Add tags to help you find this monitor later. Select the locations from which you want your monitor to run, and then click Save monitor to confirm. Generate some traffic and wait a few minutes, then check your monitor from the Monitors index. Tip You can also add monitors with the Synthetics REST API. For example, you can create a GET request to the monitor you want to use as the source for configuration, then use those key values to use in a POST to \"copy\" and create a new monitor. Edit a monitor You cannot change a monitor's type after the monitor is created, but you can edit other monitor settings. From the Monitors tab in one.newrelic.com > Synthetics, select the monitor you want to edit. In the side menu, select a link to change the following settings: Select Settings > General to edit name, Apdex T, URL, locations, frequency, and advanced options.

Delete a monitor To delete a monitor: From the Monitors tab in one.newrelic.com > Synthetics, select the monitor you want to edit. From the selected monitor, select Settings > General. Scroll to the bottom of the page and select the trash can icon. Tip You can also delete a monitor with the Synthetics REST API. Monitor settings When configuring monitors, the following settings are available: Type Select the type of monitor you want to create. A monitor's type can't be changed after the monitor is created. Ping: Specify a single URL to monitor for availability. New Relic will check this URL via HEAD or GET requests. The non-configurable timeout for this monitor is 60 seconds. Simple browser: Specify a single URL to monitor via real browser. Once each frequency interval, New Relic will check this URL via a Selenium-powered Google Chrome browser. The non-configurable timeout for this monitor is 60 seconds. Scripted browser: Create a script to drive a Selenium-powered Google Chrome browser. The browser follows each step in the script to verify that complex behavior is working as expected (for example, searching a website, then clicking one of the search results). The non-configurable timeout for this monitor is 180 seconds. API test: Create an API script to ensure your API endpoint is working correctly. For more information, see Write API tests. The non-configurable timeout for this monitor is 180 seconds. Monitor name Defines a name for the monitor. Monitor names cannot contain unencoded angle brackets (< >). To include angle brackets in a monitor name, encode them as HTML bracket entities (&lt; &gt;) in the UI or API. Location Select the locations where you want your monitor to run. Select more locations to ensure that your application is available to users around the world. If you have any private locations, they will be listed here too. You can use the Synthetics API location endpoint to retrieve a list of valid locations for your account. Your monitor will run one check from each selected location during each frequency interval. For example, if you select three locations and define a frequency of 15 minutes, your monitor will run three checks in each 15 minute period (or 8,640 checks per month). Frequency Select how often the monitor runs, in increments of minutes, hours, or 1 day. This frequency applies to each location. For example, if you select three locations and a Frequency of 15 minutes, your monitor will run three checks, on average every 5 minutes, in each 15 minute period (or 8,640 checks per month). Alerts Specify an email address to receive alerts when a monitor fails. Or, attach a monitor to an existing alert policy for more notification options. For more information, see Alerting for synthetic monitoring. Apdex T Customize the Apdex T for this monitor. This setting is only available when editing the settings for an existing monitor, not when creating a new monitor. Change the Apdex T from the default 7 seconds for more accurate Apdex scores in your SLA reports. For example, if you have a very long scripted browser, you might adjust the Apdex T to 15 seconds to more closely reflect the usual completion time. Similarly, a good Apdex T for a simple browser check might be only 2 seconds. Response Validation (optional) Specify text to search for on the page. When using simple browser or ping monitor types, there is a 1MB (10^6 bytes) limit on the page load.

      "body": "Synthetic monitors are API checks or virtual browser instances that monitor your website, recording each check in detail. They can also: Capture aggregate numbers, including an overview or summary for ping monitors. Provide detailed statistics for each page resource, and downtime incidents. Collect custom response codes for more detail on your monitor runs. You'll be able to add and configure synthetic monitors to suit your environnment after you create a New Relic account. (It's free, forever!) Add a monitor You can add several types of synthetic monitors: Ping monitors ensure your website is responding, while simple browser monitors send real browsers to check your website. For more complex monitoring, scripted browser monitors verify that specific resources are present, while API tests verify your API endpoint. The default timeout for a new monitor is 180 seconds. Add a ping or simple browser monitor Go to one.newrelic.com > Synthetics > Create monitor. Specify a monitor type, name, and URL (may be any valid HTTP or HTTPS URL). Optional: Add a validation string or Advanced options: A validation string is available for ping and simple browser. This option enables substring monitoring for response validation. Verify SSL is available for ping and simple browser. This option verifies the validity of the SSL certificate chain. It can be duplicated by running the following syntax: openssl s_client -servername {YOUR_HOSTNAME} -connect {YOUR_HOSTNAME}:443 -CApath /etc/ssl/certs -verify_hostname {YOUR_HOSTNAME} > /dev/null Copy If a non-zero exit code is returned, the monitor will fail. The Bypass HEAD request option is available for ping. This option skips the default HEAD request and instead uses the GET verb with a ping check. Redirect is Failure is available for ping. If a redirect result occurs when Redirect is Failure is enabled, New Relic Synthetics will categorize the result as a failure, rather than following the redirect and checking the resulting URL. Select the locations from which you want your monitor to run. Choose a frequency to determine how often each location will run your monitor. Optional: Set up alert notifications. Select Create my monitor to confirm. Generate some traffic and wait a few minutes, then check your monitor from the Monitors index. Add a scripted browser or API test monitor Go to one.newrelic.com > Synthetics > Create monitor. Specify a monitor type and name. Select the locations from which you want your monitor to run. Choose a frequency to determine how often each location will run your monitor. Optional: Set up alert notifications. Select Next: Write your script to create a script for your scripted browser or API test, then select Validate to verify your syntax. Tip For complex scripts, validation may take up to one minute. Select Create my monitor to confirm. Generate some traffic and wait a few minutes, then check your monitor from the Monitors index. Add a step monitor Go to one.newrelic.com > Synthetics > Create monitor. Select step monitor as the monitor type. Specify a name and choose a frequency to determine how often each location will run your monitor. Select the locations from which you want your monitor to run. Build your monitor by selecting from the preconfigured steps at the bottom of the UI: Navigate to a URL Type text Click an element Assert text Assert an element Secure a credential Use the instructions on the right side of the UI to help locate elements by CSS class, HTML ID, link text, or XPath. Select Save monitor to confirm. Generate some traffic and wait a few minutes, then check your monitor from the Monitors index. Add a certificate check monitor Go to one.newrelic.com > Synthetics > Create monitor. Select the certificate check monitor type. Specify a name and enter the domain you'd like to monitor. Enter the number of days it takes for your certificate to expire. Select the period to determine your monitor's frequency. Optional: Add tags to help you find this monitor later. Select the locations from which you want your monitor to run, and then click Save monitor to confirm. Generate some traffic and wait a few minutes, then check your monitor from the Monitors index. Add a broken links monitor Go to one.newrelic.com > Synthetics > Create monitor. Select the broken links check monitor type. Specify a name and enter the URL you'd like to monitor (may be any valid HTTP or HTTPS URL). Select the period to determine your monitor's frequency. Optional: Add tags to help you find this monitor later. Select the locations from which you want your monitor to run, and then click Save monitor to confirm. Generate some traffic and wait a few minutes, then check your monitor from the Monitors index. Tip You can also add monitors with the Synthetics REST API. For example, you can create a GET request to the monitor you want to use as the source for configuration, then use those key values to use in a POST to \"copy\" and create a new monitor. Edit a monitor You cannot change a monitor's type after the monitor is created, but you can edit other monitor settings. From the Monitors tab in one.newrelic.com > Synthetics, select the monitor you want to edit. In the side menu, select a link to change the following settings: Select Settings > General to edit name, Apdex T, URL, locations, frequency, and advanced options. For Scripted browser and API test monitors, select Settings > Script to edit your monitor script. For synthetic monitoring alerts, click Manage alerts. Select Save changes to confirm. Delete a monitor To delete a monitor: From the Monitors tab in one.newrelic.com > Synthetics, select the monitor you want to edit. From the selected monitor, select Settings > General. Scroll to the bottom of the page and select the trash can icon. Tip You can also delete a monitor with the Synthetics REST API. Monitor settings When configuring monitors, the following settings are available: Type Select the type of monitor you want to create. A monitor's type can't be changed after the monitor is created. Ping: Specify a single URL to monitor for availability. New Relic will check this URL via HEAD or GET requests. The non-configurable timeout for this monitor is 60 seconds. Simple browser: Specify a single URL to monitor via real browser. Once each frequency interval, New Relic will check this URL via a Selenium-powered Google Chrome browser. The non-configurable timeout for this monitor is 60 seconds. Scripted browser: Create a script to drive a Selenium-powered Google Chrome browser. The browser follows each step in the script to verify that complex behavior is working as expected (for example, searching a website, then clicking one of the search results). The non-configurable timeout for this monitor is 180 seconds. API test: Create an API script to ensure your API endpoint is working correctly. For more information, see Write API tests. The non-configurable timeout for this monitor is 180 seconds. Monitor name Defines a name for the monitor. Monitor names cannot contain unencoded angle brackets (< >). To include angle brackets in a monitor name, encode them as HTML bracket entities (&lt; &gt;) in the UI or API. Location Select the locations where you want your monitor to run. Select more locations to ensure that your application is available to users around the world. If you have any private locations, they will be listed here too. You can use the Synthetics API location endpoint to retrieve a list of valid locations for your account. Your monitor will run one check from each selected location during each frequency interval. For example, if you select three locations and define a frequency of 15 minutes, your monitor will run three checks in each 15 minute period (or 8,640 checks per month). Frequency Select how often the monitor runs, in increments of minutes, hours, or 1 day. This frequency applies to each location. For example, if you select three locations and a Frequency of 15 minutes, your monitor will run three checks, on average every 5 minutes, in each 15 minute period (or 8,640 checks per month). Alerts Specify an email address to receive alerts when a monitor fails. Or, attach a monitor to an existing alert policy for more notification options. For more information, see Alerting for synthetic monitoring. Apdex T Customize the Apdex T for this monitor. This setting is only available when editing the settings for an existing monitor, not when creating a new monitor. Change the Apdex T from the default 7 seconds for more accurate Apdex scores in your SLA reports. For example, if you have a very long scripted browser, you might adjust the Apdex T to 15 seconds to more closely reflect the usual completion time. Similarly, a good Apdex T for a simple browser check might be only 2 seconds. Response Validation (optional) Specify text to search for on the page. When using simple browser or ping monitor types, there is a 1MB (10^6 bytes) limit on the page load. See a history of monitor changes You can use New Relic One to see a history of recent changes to synthetic monitors and what users changed them.",

      "body": "You can use secure credentials with synthetic monitoring to store critical information, such as passwords, API keys, usernames, etc. This prevents scripted monitor users from viewing, updating, or deleting these values unless they have explicit permissions in New Relic. The credentials are securely stored using AES-GCM 256-bit encryption at rest with keys managed by Amazon AWS Key Management Service (KMS). You can set secure credentials in New Relic One or with the API. Requirements and limits Before using secure credentials, review these requirements and guidelines: Secure credentials Comments Applicable monitors The secure credentials feature is available only for synthetic scripted browsers and API test monitors. Permissions Account administrators can control which users can create, view, or delete secure credentials by managing users' permissions. Limit You can have a maximum of 1,000 secure credentials. Add or update secure credentials You can add or update secure credentials using the UI or the Synthetics REST API. To add, view, edit, or delete a secure credential for a scripted browser or API test monitor from the UI: Go to one.newrelic.com > Synthetics > Secure credentials. To add a new secure credential, look for the Create secure credential + button. If you have credentials already added, this button is at the top right. Tips for creating the Key: choose a username or other meaningful key name to identify the secure credential. Use alphanumeric or underscore _ characters. Key names must be UPPERCASE. Tips for creating the Value: Use any combination of alphanumeric or special characters. 10000 characters maximum. This field is not accessible via the API. To edit an existing credential, click the ellipsis icon for options. Associate the secure credential with a scripted browser or API test by editing the script. After you add the secure credential to the script, the Secure credentials UI shows how many scripted monitors use that credential. This number is approximate and only updates after a monitor with a secure credential has actually been run. Update the script When using the Synthetics UI editor to create scripted browsers or API test monitors, follow these guidelines: Script Guidelines Format Anywhere in the script where you reference the secure credential, it is accessed via the reserved New Relic $secure JavaScript object with dot notation. For example, $secure.MY_SECURE_CREDENTIAL. Properties on $secure are not accessible through bracket notation. Existing credentials To view or select from a list of available secure credentials: Type $secure. OR Select from the dropdown in the editor UI. Validation To validate the secure credential, follow standard procedures to test the script or write an API test. Any changes to the secure credential's value will automatically take effect across all monitors that use it. You do not need to also update the script. Exception: If you update the script and jobs are already processing, the secure credential change will not take effect until the next time the job begins. Security for secure credentials To ensure the security of your secure credentials, New Relic scrubs the secure value out of all data that goes to results in synthetic monitoring data and alerts. New Relic employees cannot access secure credential values and must be added to the account to be able to view secure credentials. Example A secure credential is named PASSWORD and the value is Pass123!. New Relic replaces Pass123! with _SECURECREDENTIAL_ For example, a script includes: $browser.get(\"https://example.com/\" + $secure.PASSWORD) Copy The script results will show that New Relic Synthetics went to https://example.com/_SECURECREDENTIAL_, even though it actually went to https://example.com/Pass123!. This ensures the value of the secure credential will not appear in the results. Redacted information We currently redact the following from the results of your monitor: The exact values of your secure credentials Any percent-encoded values of your secure credentials",

      "body": "Synthetic monitors are API checks or virtual browser instances that monitor your website, recording each check in detail. They can also: Capture aggregate numbers, including an overview or summary for ping monitors. Provide detailed statistics for each page resource, and downtime incidents. Collect custom response codes for more detail on your monitor runs. You'll be able to add and configure synthetic monitors to suit your environnment after you create a New Relic account. (It's free, forever!) Add a monitor You can add several types of synthetic monitors: Ping monitors ensure your website is responding, while simple browser monitors send real browsers to check your website. For more complex monitoring, scripted browser monitors verify that specific resources are present, while API tests verify your API endpoint. The default timeout for a new monitor is 180 seconds. Add a ping or simple browser monitor Go to one.newrelic.com > Synthetics > Create monitor. Specify a monitor type, name, and URL (may be any valid HTTP or HTTPS URL). Optional: Add a validation string or Advanced options: A validation string is available for ping and simple browser. This option enables substring monitoring for response validation. Verify SSL is available for ping and simple browser. This option verifies the validity of the SSL certificate chain. It can be duplicated by running the following syntax: openssl s_client -servername {YOUR_HOSTNAME} -connect {YOUR_HOSTNAME}:443 -CApath /etc/ssl/certs -verify_hostname {YOUR_HOSTNAME} > /dev/null Copy If a non-zero exit code is returned, the monitor will fail. The Bypass HEAD request option is available for ping. This option skips the default HEAD request and instead uses the GET verb with a ping check. Redirect is Failure is available for ping. If a redirect result occurs when Redirect is Failure is enabled, New Relic Synthetics will categorize the result as a failure, rather than following the redirect and checking the resulting URL. Select the locations from which you want your monitor to run. Choose a frequency to determine how often each location will run your monitor. Optional: Set up alert notifications. Select Create my monitor to confirm. Generate some traffic and wait a few minutes, then check your monitor from the Monitors index. Add a scripted browser or API test monitor Go to one.newrelic.com > Synthetics > Create monitor. Specify a monitor type and name. Select the locations from which you want your monitor to run. Choose a frequency to determine how often each location will run your monitor. Optional: Set up alert notifications. Select Next: Write your script to create a script for your scripted browser or API test, then select Validate to verify your syntax. Tip For complex scripts, validation may take up to one minute. Select Create my monitor to confirm. Generate some traffic and wait a few minutes, then check your monitor from the Monitors index. Add a step monitor Go to one.newrelic.com > Synthetics > Create monitor. Select step monitor as the monitor type. Specify a name and choose a frequency to determine how often each location will run your monitor. Select the locations from which you want your monitor to run. Build your monitor by selecting from the preconfigured steps at the bottom of the UI: Navigate to a URL Type text Click an element Assert text Assert an element Secure a credential Use the instructions on the right side of the UI to help locate elements by CSS class, HTML ID, link text, or XPath. Select Save monitor to confirm. Generate some traffic and wait a few minutes, then check your monitor from the Monitors index. Add a certificate check monitor Go to one.newrelic.com > Synthetics > Create monitor. Select the certificate check monitor type. Specify a name and enter the domain you'd like to monitor. Enter the number of days it takes for your certificate to expire. Select the period to determine your monitor's frequency. Optional: Add tags to help you find this monitor later. Select the locations from which you want your monitor to run, and then click Save monitor to confirm. Generate some traffic and wait a few minutes, then check your monitor from the Monitors index. Add a broken links monitor Go to one.newrelic.com > Synthetics > Create monitor. Select the broken links check monitor type. Specify a name and enter the URL you'd like to monitor (may be any valid HTTP or HTTPS URL). Select the period to determine your monitor's frequency. Optional: Add tags to help you find this monitor later. Select the locations from which you want your monitor to run, and then click Save monitor to confirm. Generate some traffic and wait a few minutes, then check your monitor from the Monitors index. Tip You can also add monitors with the Synthetics REST API. For example, you can create a GET request to the monitor you want to use as the source for configuration, then use those key values to use in a POST to \"copy\" and create a new monitor. Edit a monitor You cannot change a monitor's type after the monitor is created, but you can edit other monitor settings. From the Monitors tab in one.newrelic.com > Synthetics, select the monitor you want to edit. In the side menu, select a link to change the following settings: Select Settings > General to edit name, Apdex T, URL, locations, frequency, and advanced options. For Scripted browser and API test monitors, select Settings > Script to edit your monitor script. For synthetic monitoring alerts, click Manage alerts. Select Save changes to confirm. Delete a monitor To delete a monitor: From the Monitors tab in one.newrelic.com > Synthetics, select the monitor you want to edit. From the selected monitor, select Settings > General. Scroll to the bottom of the page and select the trash can icon. Tip You can also delete a monitor with the Synthetics REST API. Monitor settings When configuring monitors, the following settings are available: Type Select the type of monitor you want to create. A monitor's type can't be changed after the monitor is created. Ping: Specify a single URL to monitor for availability. New Relic will check this URL via HEAD or GET requests. The non-configurable timeout for this monitor is 60 seconds. Simple browser: Specify a single URL to monitor via real browser. Once each frequency interval, New Relic will check this URL via a Selenium-powered Google Chrome browser. The non-configurable timeout for this monitor is 60 seconds. Scripted browser: Create a script to drive a Selenium-powered Google Chrome browser. The browser follows each step in the script to verify that complex behavior is working as expected (for example, searching a website, then clicking one of the search results). The non-configurable timeout for this monitor is 180 seconds. API test: Create an API script to ensure your API endpoint is working correctly. For more information, see Write API tests. The non-configurable timeout for this monitor is 180 seconds. Monitor name Defines a name for the monitor. Monitor names cannot contain unencoded angle brackets (< >). To include angle brackets in a monitor name, encode them as HTML bracket entities (&lt; &gt;) in the UI or API. Location Select the locations where you want your monitor to run. Select more locations to ensure that your application is available to users around the world. If you have any private locations, they will be listed here too. You can use the Synthetics API location endpoint to retrieve a list of valid locations for your account. Your monitor will run one check from each selected location during each frequency interval. For example, if you select three locations and define a frequency of 15 minutes, your monitor will run three checks in each 15 minute period (or 8,640 checks per month). Frequency Select how often the monitor runs, in increments of minutes, hours, or 1 day. This frequency applies to each location. For example, if you select three locations and a Frequency of 15 minutes, your monitor will run three checks, on average every 5 minutes, in each 15 minute period (or 8,640 checks per month). Alerts Specify an email address to receive alerts when a monitor fails. Or, attach a monitor to an existing alert policy for more notification options. For more information, see Alerting for synthetic monitoring. Apdex T Customize the Apdex T for this monitor. This setting is only available when editing the settings for an existing monitor, not when creating a new monitor. Change the Apdex T from the default 7 seconds for more accurate Apdex scores in your SLA reports. For example, if you have a very long scripted browser, you might adjust the Apdex T to 15 seconds to more closely reflect the usual completion time. Similarly, a good Apdex T for a simple browser check might be only 2 seconds. Response Validation (optional) Specify text to search for on the page. When using simple browser or ping monitor types, there is a 1MB (10^6 bytes) limit on the page load.

      "body": "Synthetic monitors are API checks or virtual browser instances that monitor your website, recording each check in detail. They can also: Capture aggregate numbers, including an overview or summary for ping monitors. Provide detailed statistics for each page resource, and downtime incidents. Collect custom response codes for more detail on your monitor runs. You'll be able to add and configure synthetic monitors to suit your environnment after you create a New Relic account. (It's free, forever!) Add a monitor You can add several types of synthetic monitors: Ping monitors ensure your website is responding, while simple browser monitors send real browsers to check your website. For more complex monitoring, scripted browser monitors verify that specific resources are present, while API tests verify your API endpoint. The default timeout for a new monitor is 180 seconds. Add a ping or simple browser monitor Go to one.newrelic.com > Synthetics > Create monitor. Specify a monitor type, name, and URL (may be any valid HTTP or HTTPS URL). Optional: Add a validation string or Advanced options: A validation string is available for ping and simple browser. This option enables substring monitoring for response validation. Verify SSL is available for ping and simple browser. This option verifies the validity of the SSL certificate chain. It can be duplicated by running the following syntax: openssl s_client -servername {YOUR_HOSTNAME} -connect {YOUR_HOSTNAME}:443 -CApath /etc/ssl/certs -verify_hostname {YOUR_HOSTNAME} > /dev/null Copy If a non-zero exit code is returned, the monitor will fail. The Bypass HEAD request option is available for ping. This option skips the default HEAD request and instead uses the GET verb with a ping check. Redirect is Failure is available for ping. If a redirect result occurs when Redirect is Failure is enabled, New Relic Synthetics will categorize the result as a failure, rather than following the redirect and checking the resulting URL. Select the locations from which you want your monitor to run. Choose a frequency to determine how often each location will run your monitor. Optional: Set up alert notifications. Select Create my monitor to confirm. Generate some traffic and wait a few minutes, then check your monitor from the Monitors index. Add a scripted browser or API test monitor Go to one.newrelic.com > Synthetics > Create monitor. Specify a monitor type and name. Select the locations from which you want your monitor to run. Choose a frequency to determine how often each location will run your monitor. Optional: Set up alert notifications. Select Next: Write your script to create a script for your scripted browser or API test, then select Validate to verify your syntax. Tip For complex scripts, validation may take up to one minute. Select Create my monitor to confirm. Generate some traffic and wait a few minutes, then check your monitor from the Monitors index. Add a step monitor Go to one.newrelic.com > Synthetics > Create monitor. Select step monitor as the monitor type. Specify a name and choose a frequency to determine how often each location will run your monitor. Select the locations from which you want your monitor to run. Build your monitor by selecting from the preconfigured steps at the bottom of the UI: Navigate to a URL Type text Click an element Assert text Assert an element Secure a credential Use the instructions on the right side of the UI to help locate elements by CSS class, HTML ID, link text, or XPath. Select Save monitor to confirm. Generate some traffic and wait a few minutes, then check your monitor from the Monitors index. Add a certificate check monitor Go to one.newrelic.com > Synthetics > Create monitor. Select the certificate check monitor type. Specify a name and enter the domain you'd like to monitor. Enter the number of days it takes for your certificate to expire. Select the period to determine your monitor's frequency. Optional: Add tags to help you find this monitor later. Select the locations from which you want your monitor to run, and then click Save monitor to confirm. Generate some traffic and wait a few minutes, then check your monitor from the Monitors index. Add a broken links monitor Go to one.newrelic.com > Synthetics > Create monitor. Select the broken links check monitor type. Specify a name and enter the URL you'd like to monitor (may be any valid HTTP or HTTPS URL). Select the period to determine your monitor's frequency. Optional: Add tags to help you find this monitor later. Select the locations from which you want your monitor to run, and then click Save monitor to confirm. Generate some traffic and wait a few minutes, then check your monitor from the Monitors index. Tip You can also add monitors with the Synthetics REST API. For example, you can create a GET request to the monitor you want to use as the source for configuration, then use those key values to use in a POST to \"copy\" and create a new monitor. Edit a monitor You cannot change a monitor's type after the monitor is created, but you can edit other monitor settings. From the Monitors tab in one.newrelic.com > Synthetics, select the monitor you want to edit. In the side menu, select a link to change the following settings: Select Settings > General to edit name, Apdex T, URL, locations, frequency, and advanced options. For Scripted browser and API test monitors, select Settings > Script to edit your monitor script. For synthetic monitoring alerts, click Manage alerts. Select Save changes to confirm. Delete a monitor To delete a monitor: From the Monitors tab in one.newrelic.com > Synthetics, select the monitor you want to edit. From the selected monitor, select Settings > General. Scroll to the bottom of the page and select the trash can icon. Tip You can also delete a monitor with the Synthetics REST API. Monitor settings When configuring monitors, the following settings are available: Type Select the type of monitor you want to create. A monitor's type can't be changed after the monitor is created. Ping: Specify a single URL to monitor for availability. New Relic will check this URL via HEAD or GET requests. The non-configurable timeout for this monitor is 60 seconds. Simple browser: Specify a single URL to monitor via real browser. Once each frequency interval, New Relic will check this URL via a Selenium-powered Google Chrome browser. The non-configurable timeout for this monitor is 60 seconds. Scripted browser: Create a script to drive a Selenium-powered Google Chrome browser. The browser follows each step in the script to verify that complex behavior is working as expected (for example, searching a website, then clicking one of the search results). The non-configurable timeout for this monitor is 180 seconds. API test: Create an API script to ensure your API endpoint is working correctly. For more information, see Write API tests. The non-configurable timeout for this monitor is 180 seconds. Monitor name Defines a name for the monitor. Monitor names cannot contain unencoded angle brackets (< >). To include angle brackets in a monitor name, encode them as HTML bracket entities (&lt; &gt;) in the UI or API. Location Select the locations where you want your monitor to run. Select more locations to ensure that your application is available to users around the world. If you have any private locations, they will be listed here too. You can use the Synthetics API location endpoint to retrieve a list of valid locations for your account. Your monitor will run one check from each selected location during each frequency interval. For example, if you select three locations and define a frequency of 15 minutes, your monitor will run three checks in each 15 minute period (or 8,640 checks per month). Frequency Select how often the monitor runs, in increments of minutes, hours, or 1 day. This frequency applies to each location. For example, if you select three locations and a Frequency of 15 minutes, your monitor will run three checks, on average every 5 minutes, in each 15 minute period (or 8,640 checks per month). Alerts Specify an email address to receive alerts when a monitor fails. Or, attach a monitor to an existing alert policy for more notification options. For more information, see Alerting for synthetic monitoring. Apdex T Customize the Apdex T for this monitor. This setting is only available when editing the settings for an existing monitor, not when creating a new monitor. Change the Apdex T from the default 7 seconds for more accurate Apdex scores in your SLA reports. For example, if you have a very long scripted browser, you might adjust the Apdex T to 15 seconds to more closely reflect the usual completion time. Similarly, a good Apdex T for a simple browser check might be only 2 seconds. Response Validation (optional) Specify text to search for on the page. When using simple browser or ping monitor types, there is a 1MB (10^6 bytes) limit on the page load. See a history of monitor changes You can use New Relic One to see a history of recent changes to synthetic monitors and what users changed them.",

      "body": "Synthetic monitors are API checks or virtual browser instances that monitor your website, recording each check in detail. They can also: Capture aggregate numbers, including an overview or summary for ping monitors. Provide detailed statistics for each page resource, and downtime incidents. Collect custom response codes for more detail on your monitor runs. You'll be able to add and configure synthetic monitors to suit your environnment after you create a New Relic account. (It's free, forever!) Add a monitor You can add several types of synthetic monitors: Ping monitors ensure your website is responding, while simple browser monitors send real browsers to check your website. For more complex monitoring, scripted browser monitors verify that specific resources are present, while API tests verify your API endpoint. The default timeout for a new monitor is 180 seconds. Add a ping or simple browser monitor Go to one.newrelic.com > Synthetics > Create monitor. Specify a monitor type, name, and URL (may be any valid HTTP or HTTPS URL). Optional: Add a validation string or Advanced options: A validation string is available for ping and simple browser. This option enables substring monitoring for response validation. Verify SSL is available for ping and simple browser. This option verifies the validity of the SSL certificate chain. It can be duplicated by running the following syntax: openssl s_client -servername {YOUR_HOSTNAME} -connect {YOUR_HOSTNAME}:443 -CApath /etc/ssl/certs -verify_hostname {YOUR_HOSTNAME} > /dev/null Copy If a non-zero exit code is returned, the monitor will fail. The Bypass HEAD request option is available for ping. This option skips the default HEAD request and instead uses the GET verb with a ping check. Redirect is Failure is available for ping. If a redirect result occurs when Redirect is Failure is enabled, New Relic Synthetics will categorize the result as a failure, rather than following the redirect and checking the resulting URL. Select the locations from which you want your monitor to run. Choose a frequency to determine how often each location will run your monitor. Optional: Set up alert notifications. Select Create my monitor to confirm. Generate some traffic and wait a few minutes, then check your monitor from the Monitors index. Add a scripted browser or API test monitor Go to one.newrelic.com > Synthetics > Create monitor. Specify a monitor type and name. Select the locations from which you want your monitor to run. Choose a frequency to determine how often each location will run your monitor. Optional: Set up alert notifications. Select Next: Write your script to create a script for your scripted browser or API test, then select Validate to verify your syntax. Tip For complex scripts, validation may take up to one minute. Select Create my monitor to confirm. Generate some traffic and wait a few minutes, then check your monitor from the Monitors index. Add a step monitor Go to one.newrelic.com > Synthetics > Create monitor. Select step monitor as the monitor type. Specify a name and choose a frequency to determine how often each location will run your monitor. Select the locations from which you want your monitor to run. Build your monitor by selecting from the preconfigured steps at the bottom of the UI: Navigate to a URL Type text Click an element Assert text Assert an element Secure a credential Use the instructions on the right side of the UI to help locate elements by CSS class, HTML ID, link text, or XPath. Select Save monitor to confirm. Generate some traffic and wait a few minutes, then check your monitor from the Monitors index. Add a certificate check monitor Go to one.newrelic.com > Synthetics > Create monitor. Select the certificate check monitor type. Specify a name and enter the domain you'd like to monitor. Enter the number of days it takes for your certificate to expire. Select the period to determine your monitor's frequency. Optional: Add tags to help you find this monitor later. Select the locations from which you want your monitor to run, and then click Save monitor to confirm. Generate some traffic and wait a few minutes, then check your monitor from the Monitors index. Add a broken links monitor Go to one.newrelic.com > Synthetics > Create monitor. Select the broken links check monitor type. Specify a name and enter the URL you'd like to monitor (may be any valid HTTP or HTTPS URL). Select the period to determine your monitor's frequency. Optional: Add tags to help you find this monitor later. Select the locations from which you want your monitor to run, and then click Save monitor to confirm. Generate some traffic and wait a few minutes, then check your monitor from the Monitors index. Tip You can also add monitors with the Synthetics REST API. For example, you can create a GET request to the monitor you want to use as the source for configuration, then use those key values to use in a POST to \"copy\" and create a new monitor. Edit a monitor You cannot change a monitor's type after the monitor is created, but you can edit other monitor settings. From the Monitors tab in one.newrelic.com > Synthetics, select the monitor you want to edit. In the side menu, select a link to change the following settings: Select Settings > General to edit name, Apdex T, URL, locations, frequency, and advanced options. For Scripted browser and API test monitors, select Settings > Script to edit your monitor script. For synthetic monitoring alerts, click Manage alerts. Select Save changes to confirm. Delete a monitor To delete a monitor: From the Monitors tab in one.newrelic.com > Synthetics, select the monitor you want to edit. From the selected monitor, select Settings > General. Scroll to the bottom of the page and select the trash can icon. Tip You can also delete a monitor with the Synthetics REST API. Monitor settings When configuring monitors, the following settings are available: Type Select the type of monitor you want to create. A monitor's type can't be changed after the monitor is created. Ping: Specify a single URL to monitor for availability. New Relic will check this URL via HEAD or GET requests. The non-configurable timeout for this monitor is 60 seconds. Simple browser: Specify a single URL to monitor via real browser. Once each frequency interval, New Relic will check this URL via a Selenium-powered Google Chrome browser. The non-configurable timeout for this monitor is 60 seconds. Scripted browser: Create a script to drive a Selenium-powered Google Chrome browser. The browser follows each step in the script to verify that complex behavior is working as expected (for example, searching a website, then clicking one of the search results). The non-configurable timeout for this monitor is 180 seconds. API test: Create an API script to ensure your API endpoint is working correctly. For more information, see Write API tests. The non-configurable timeout for this monitor is 180 seconds. Monitor name Defines a name for the monitor. Monitor names cannot contain unencoded angle brackets (< >). To include angle brackets in a monitor name, encode them as HTML bracket entities (&lt; &gt;) in the UI or API. Location Select the locations where you want your monitor to run. Select more locations to ensure that your application is available to users around the world. If you have any private locations, they will be listed here too. You can use the Synthetics API location endpoint to retrieve a list of valid locations for your account. Your monitor will run one check from each selected location during each frequency interval. For example, if you select three locations and define a frequency of 15 minutes, your monitor will run three checks in each 15 minute period (or 8,640 checks per month). Frequency Select how often the monitor runs, in increments of minutes, hours, or 1 day. This frequency applies to each location. For example, if you select three locations and a Frequency of 15 minutes, your monitor will run three checks, on average every 5 minutes, in each 15 minute period (or 8,640 checks per month). Alerts Specify an email address to receive alerts when a monitor fails. Or, attach a monitor to an existing alert policy for more notification options. For more information, see Alerting for synthetic monitoring. Apdex T Customize the Apdex T for this monitor. This setting is only available when editing the settings for an existing monitor, not when creating a new monitor. Change the Apdex T from the default 7 seconds for more accurate Apdex scores in your SLA reports. For example, if you have a very long scripted browser, you might adjust the Apdex T to 15 seconds to more closely reflect the usual completion time. Similarly, a good Apdex T for a simple browser check might be only 2 seconds. Response Validation (optional) Specify text to search for on the page. When using simple browser or ping monitor types, there is a 1MB (10^6 bytes) limit on the page load. See a history of monitor changes You can use New Relic One to see a history of recent changes to synthetic monitors and what users changed them.",

      "body": "You can use secure credentials with synthetic monitoring to store critical information, such as passwords, API keys, usernames, etc. This prevents scripted monitor users from viewing, updating, or deleting these values unless they have explicit permissions in New Relic. The credentials are securely stored using AES-GCM 256-bit encryption at rest with keys managed by Amazon AWS Key Management Service (KMS). You can set secure credentials in New Relic One or with the API. Requirements and limits Before using secure credentials, review these requirements and guidelines: Secure credentials Comments Applicable monitors The secure credentials feature is available only for synthetic scripted browsers and API test monitors. Permissions Account administrators can control which users can create, view, or delete secure credentials by managing users' permissions. Limit You can have a maximum of 1,000 secure credentials. Add or update secure credentials You can add or update secure credentials using the UI or the Synthetics REST API. To add, view, edit, or delete a secure credential for a scripted browser or API test monitor from the UI: Go to one.newrelic.com > Synthetics > Secure credentials. To add a new secure credential, look for the Create secure credential + button. If you have credentials already added, this button is at the top right. Tips for creating the Key: choose a username or other meaningful key name to identify the secure credential. Use alphanumeric or underscore _ characters. Key names must be UPPERCASE. Tips for creating the Value: Use any combination of alphanumeric or special characters. 10000 characters maximum. This field is not accessible via the API. To edit an existing credential, click the ellipsis icon for options. Associate the secure credential with a scripted browser or API test by editing the script. After you add the secure credential to the script, the Secure credentials UI shows how many scripted monitors use that credential. This number is approximate and only updates after a monitor with a secure credential has actually been run. Update the script When using the Synthetics UI editor to create scripted browsers or API test monitors, follow these guidelines: Script Guidelines Format Anywhere in the script where you reference the secure credential, it is accessed via the reserved New Relic $secure JavaScript object with dot notation. For example, $secure.MY_SECURE_CREDENTIAL. Properties on $secure are not accessible through bracket notation. Existing credentials To view or select from a list of available secure credentials: Type $secure. OR Select from the dropdown in the editor UI. Validation To validate the secure credential, follow standard procedures to test the script or write an API test. Any changes to the secure credential's value will automatically take effect across all monitors that use it. You do not need to also update the script. Exception: If you update the script and jobs are already processing, the secure credential change will not take effect until the next time the job begins. Security for secure credentials To ensure the security of your secure credentials, New Relic scrubs the secure value out of all data that goes to results in synthetic monitoring data and alerts. New Relic employees cannot access secure credential values and must be added to the account to be able to view secure credentials. Example A secure credential is named PASSWORD and the value is Pass123!. New Relic replaces Pass123! with _SECURECREDENTIAL_ For example, a script includes: $browser.get(\"https://example.com/\" + $secure.PASSWORD) Copy The script results will show that New Relic Synthetics went to https://example.com/_SECURECREDENTIAL_, even though it actually went to https://example.com/Pass123!. This ensures the value of the secure credential will not appear in the results. Redacted information We currently redact the following from the results of your monitor: The exact values of your secure credentials Any percent-encoded values of your secure credentials",

      "body": "Synthetic monitors are API checks or virtual browser instances that monitor your website, recording each check in detail. They can also: Capture aggregate numbers, including an overview or summary for ping monitors. Provide detailed statistics for each page resource, and downtime incidents. Collect custom response codes for more detail on your monitor runs. You'll be able to add and configure synthetic monitors to suit your environnment after you create a New Relic account. (It's free, forever!) Add a monitor You can add several types of synthetic monitors: Ping monitors ensure your website is responding, while simple browser monitors send real browsers to check your website. For more complex monitoring, scripted browser monitors verify that specific resources are present, while API tests verify your API endpoint. The default timeout for a new monitor is 180 seconds. Add a ping or simple browser monitor Go to one.newrelic.com > Synthetics > Create monitor. Specify a monitor type, name, and URL (may be any valid HTTP or HTTPS URL). Optional: Add a validation string or Advanced options: A validation string is available for ping and simple browser. This option enables substring monitoring for response validation. Verify SSL is available for ping and simple browser. This option verifies the validity of the SSL certificate chain. It can be duplicated by running the following syntax: openssl s_client -servername {YOUR_HOSTNAME} -connect {YOUR_HOSTNAME}:443 -CApath /etc/ssl/certs -verify_hostname {YOUR_HOSTNAME} > /dev/null Copy If a non-zero exit code is returned, the monitor will fail. The Bypass HEAD request option is available for ping. This option skips the default HEAD request and instead uses the GET verb with a ping check. Redirect is Failure is available for ping. If a redirect result occurs when Redirect is Failure is enabled, New Relic Synthetics will categorize the result as a failure, rather than following the redirect and checking the resulting URL. Select the locations from which you want your monitor to run. Choose a frequency to determine how often each location will run your monitor. Optional: Set up alert notifications. Select Create my monitor to confirm. Generate some traffic and wait a few minutes, then check your monitor from the Monitors index. Add a scripted browser or API test monitor Go to one.newrelic.com > Synthetics > Create monitor. Specify a monitor type and name. Select the locations from which you want your monitor to run. Choose a frequency to determine how often each location will run your monitor. Optional: Set up alert notifications. Select Next: Write your script to create a script for your scripted browser or API test, then select Validate to verify your syntax. Tip For complex scripts, validation may take up to one minute. Select Create my monitor to confirm. Generate some traffic and wait a few minutes, then check your monitor from the Monitors index. Add a step monitor Go to one.newrelic.com > Synthetics > Create monitor. Select step monitor as the monitor type. Specify a name and choose a frequency to determine how often each location will run your monitor. Select the locations from which you want your monitor to run. Build your monitor by selecting from the preconfigured steps at the bottom of the UI: Navigate to a URL Type text Click an element Assert text Assert an element Secure a credential Use the instructions on the right side of the UI to help locate elements by CSS class, HTML ID, link text, or XPath. Select Save monitor to confirm. Generate some traffic and wait a few minutes, then check your monitor from the Monitors index. Add a certificate check monitor Go to one.newrelic.com > Synthetics > Create monitor. Select the certificate check monitor type. Specify a name and enter the domain you'd like to monitor. Enter the number of days it takes for your certificate to expire. Select the period to determine your monitor's frequency. Optional: Add tags to help you find this monitor later. Select the locations from which you want your monitor to run, and then click Save monitor to confirm. Generate some traffic and wait a few minutes, then check your monitor from the Monitors index. Add a broken links monitor Go to one.newrelic.com > Synthetics > Create monitor. Select the broken links check monitor type. Specify a name and enter the URL you'd like to monitor (may be any valid HTTP or HTTPS URL). Select the period to determine your monitor's frequency. Optional: Add tags to help you find this monitor later. Select the locations from which you want your monitor to run, and then click Save monitor to confirm. Generate some traffic and wait a few minutes, then check your monitor from the Monitors index. Tip You can also add monitors with the Synthetics REST API. For example, you can create a GET request to the monitor you want to use as the source for configuration, then use those key values to use in a POST to \"copy\" and create a new monitor. Edit a monitor You cannot change a monitor's type after the monitor is created, but you can edit other monitor settings. From the Monitors tab in one.newrelic.com > Synthetics, select the monitor you want to edit. In the side menu, select a link to change the following settings: Select Settings > General to edit name, Apdex T, URL, locations, frequency, and advanced options. For Scripted browser and API test monitors, select Settings > Script to edit your monitor script. For synthetic monitoring alerts, click Manage alerts. Select Save changes to confirm. Delete a monitor To delete a monitor: From the Monitors tab in one.newrelic.com > Synthetics, select the monitor you want to edit. From the selected monitor, select Settings > General. Scroll to the bottom of the page and select the trash can icon. Tip You can also delete a monitor with the Synthetics REST API. Monitor settings When configuring monitors, the following settings are available: Type Select the type of monitor you want to create. A monitor's type can't be changed after the monitor is created. Ping: Specify a single URL to monitor for availability. New Relic will check this URL via HEAD or GET requests. The non-configurable timeout for this monitor is 60 seconds. Simple browser: Specify a single URL to monitor via real browser. Once each frequency interval, New Relic will check this URL via a Selenium-powered Google Chrome browser. The non-configurable timeout for this monitor is 60 seconds. Scripted browser: Create a script to drive a Selenium-powered Google Chrome browser. The browser follows each step in the script to verify that complex behavior is working as expected (for example, searching a website, then clicking one of the search results). The non-configurable timeout for this monitor is 180 seconds. API test: Create an API script to ensure your API endpoint is working correctly. For more information, see Write API tests. The non-configurable timeout for this monitor is 180 seconds. Monitor name Defines a name for the monitor. Monitor names cannot contain unencoded angle brackets (< >). To include angle brackets in a monitor name, encode them as HTML bracket entities (&lt; &gt;) in the UI or API. Location Select the locations where you want your monitor to run. Select more locations to ensure that your application is available to users around the world. If you have any private locations, they will be listed here too. You can use the Synthetics API location endpoint to retrieve a list of valid locations for your account. Your monitor will run one check from each selected location during each frequency interval. For example, if you select three locations and define a frequency of 15 minutes, your monitor will run three checks in each 15 minute period (or 8,640 checks per month). Frequency Select how often the monitor runs, in increments of minutes, hours, or 1 day. This frequency applies to each location. For example, if you select three locations and a Frequency of 15 minutes, your monitor will run three checks, on average every 5 minutes, in each 15 minute period (or 8,640 checks per month). Alerts Specify an email address to receive alerts when a monitor fails. Or, attach a monitor to an existing alert policy for more notification options. For more information, see Alerting for synthetic monitoring. Apdex T Customize the Apdex T for this monitor. This setting is only available when editing the settings for an existing monitor, not when creating a new monitor. Change the Apdex T from the default 7 seconds for more accurate Apdex scores in your SLA reports. For example, if you have a very long scripted browser, you might adjust the Apdex T to 15 seconds to more closely reflect the usual completion time. Similarly, a good Apdex T for a simple browser check might be only 2 seconds. Response Validation (optional) Specify text to search for on the page. When using simple browser or ping monitor types, there is a 1MB (10^6 bytes) limit on the page load.

      "body": "Synthetic monitors are API checks or virtual browser instances that monitor your website, recording each check in detail. They can also: Capture aggregate numbers, including an overview or summary for ping monitors. Provide detailed statistics for each page resource, and downtime incidents. Collect custom response codes for more detail on your monitor runs. You'll be able to add and configure synthetic monitors to suit your environnment after you create a New Relic account. (It's free, forever!) Add a monitor You can add several types of synthetic monitors: Ping monitors ensure your website is responding, while simple browser monitors send real browsers to check your website. For more complex monitoring, scripted browser monitors verify that specific resources are present, while API tests verify your API endpoint. The default timeout for a new monitor is 180 seconds. Add a ping or simple browser monitor Go to one.newrelic.com > Synthetics > Create monitor. Specify a monitor type, name, and URL (may be any valid HTTP or HTTPS URL). Optional: Add a validation string or Advanced options: A validation string is available for ping and simple browser. This option enables substring monitoring for response validation. Verify SSL is available for ping and simple browser. This option verifies the validity of the SSL certificate chain. It can be duplicated by running the following syntax: openssl s_client -servername {YOUR_HOSTNAME} -connect {YOUR_HOSTNAME}:443 -CApath /etc/ssl/certs -verify_hostname {YOUR_HOSTNAME} > /dev/null Copy If a non-zero exit code is returned, the monitor will fail. The Bypass HEAD request option is available for ping. This option skips the default HEAD request and instead uses the GET verb with a ping check. Redirect is Failure is available for ping. If a redirect result occurs when Redirect is Failure is enabled, New Relic Synthetics will categorize the result as a failure, rather than following the redirect and checking the resulting URL. Select the locations from which you want your monitor to run. Choose a frequency to determine how often each location will run your monitor. Optional: Set up alert notifications. Select Create my monitor to confirm. Generate some traffic and wait a few minutes, then check your monitor from the Monitors index. Add a scripted browser or API test monitor Go to one.newrelic.com > Synthetics > Create monitor. Specify a monitor type and name. Select the locations from which you want your monitor to run. Choose a frequency to determine how often each location will run your monitor. Optional: Set up alert notifications. Select Next: Write your script to create a script for your scripted browser or API test, then select Validate to verify your syntax. Tip For complex scripts, validation may take up to one minute. Select Create my monitor to confirm. Generate some traffic and wait a few minutes, then check your monitor from the Monitors index. Add a step monitor Go to one.newrelic.com > Synthetics > Create monitor. Select step monitor as the monitor type. Specify a name and choose a frequency to determine how often each location will run your monitor. Select the locations from which you want your monitor to run. Build your monitor by selecting from the preconfigured steps at the bottom of the UI: Navigate to a URL Type text Click an element Assert text Assert an element Secure a credential Use the instructions on the right side of the UI to help locate elements by CSS class, HTML ID, link text, or XPath. Select Save monitor to confirm. Generate some traffic and wait a few minutes, then check your monitor from the Monitors index. Add a certificate check monitor Go to one.newrelic.com > Synthetics > Create monitor. Select the certificate check monitor type. Specify a name and enter the domain you'd like to monitor. Enter the number of days it takes for your certificate to expire. Select the period to determine your monitor's frequency. Optional: Add tags to help you find this monitor later. Select the locations from which you want your monitor to run, and then click Save monitor to confirm. Generate some traffic and wait a few minutes, then check your monitor from the Monitors index. Add a broken links monitor Go to one.newrelic.com > Synthetics > Create monitor. Select the broken links check monitor type. Specify a name and enter the URL you'd like to monitor (may be any valid HTTP or HTTPS URL). Select the period to determine your monitor's frequency. Optional: Add tags to help you find this monitor later. Select the locations from which you want your monitor to run, and then click Save monitor to confirm. Generate some traffic and wait a few minutes, then check your monitor from the Monitors index. Tip You can also add monitors with the Synthetics REST API. For example, you can create a GET request to the monitor you want to use as the source for configuration, then use those key values to use in a POST to \"copy\" and create a new monitor. Edit a monitor You cannot change a monitor's type after the monitor is created, but you can edit other monitor settings. From the Monitors tab in one.newrelic.com > Synthetics, select the monitor you want to edit. In the side menu, select a link to change the following settings: Select Settings > General to edit name, Apdex T, URL, locations, frequency, and advanced options. For Scripted browser and API test monitors, select Settings > Script to edit your monitor script. For synthetic monitoring alerts, click Manage alerts. Select Save changes to confirm. Delete a monitor To delete a monitor: From the Monitors tab in one.newrelic.com > Synthetics, select the monitor you want to edit. From the selected monitor, select Settings > General. Scroll to the bottom of the page and select the trash can icon. Tip You can also delete a monitor with the Synthetics REST API. Monitor settings When configuring monitors, the following settings are available: Type Select the type of monitor you want to create. A monitor's type can't be changed after the monitor is created. Ping: Specify a single URL to monitor for availability. New Relic will check this URL via HEAD or GET requests. The non-configurable timeout for this monitor is 60 seconds. Simple browser: Specify a single URL to monitor via real browser. Once each frequency interval, New Relic will check this URL via a Selenium-powered Google Chrome browser. The non-configurable timeout for this monitor is 60 seconds. Scripted browser: Create a script to drive a Selenium-powered Google Chrome browser. The browser follows each step in the script to verify that complex behavior is working as expected (for example, searching a website, then clicking one of the search results). The non-configurable timeout for this monitor is 180 seconds. API test: Create an API script to ensure your API endpoint is working correctly. For more information, see Write API tests. The non-configurable timeout for this monitor is 180 seconds. Monitor name Defines a name for the monitor. Monitor names cannot contain unencoded angle brackets (< >). To include angle brackets in a monitor name, encode them as HTML bracket entities (&lt; &gt;) in the UI or API. Location Select the locations where you want your monitor to run. Select more locations to ensure that your application is available to users around the world. If you have any private locations, they will be listed here too. You can use the Synthetics API location endpoint to retrieve a list of valid locations for your account. Your monitor will run one check from each selected location during each frequency interval. For example, if you select three locations and define a frequency of 15 minutes, your monitor will run three checks in each 15 minute period (or 8,640 checks per month). Frequency Select how often the monitor runs, in increments of minutes, hours, or 1 day. This frequency applies to each location. For example, if you select three locations and a Frequency of 15 minutes, your monitor will run three checks, on average every 5 minutes, in each 15 minute period (or 8,640 checks per month). Alerts Specify an email address to receive alerts when a monitor fails. Or, attach a monitor to an existing alert policy for more notification options. For more information, see Alerting for synthetic monitoring. Apdex T Customize the Apdex T for this monitor. This setting is only available when editing the settings for an existing monitor, not when creating a new monitor. Change the Apdex T from the default 7 seconds for more accurate Apdex scores in your SLA reports. For example, if you have a very long scripted browser, you might adjust the Apdex T to 15 seconds to more closely reflect the usual completion time. Similarly, a good Apdex T for a simple browser check might be only 2 seconds. Response Validation (optional) Specify text to search for on the page. When using simple browser or ping monitor types, there is a 1MB (10^6 bytes) limit on the page load. See a history of monitor changes You can use New Relic One to see a history of recent changes to synthetic monitors and what users changed them.",

      "body": "This list is current. Last updated September 28, 2021. This is a list of the networks, IP addresses, domains, ports, and endpoints used by API clients or agents to communicate with New Relic. TLS is required for all domains. Your browser must be able to communicate with a number of domains for New Relic One to work properly. See User-facing domains for the list of domains to be allowed through your firewall. For information on our FedRAMP endpoints, see our FedRAMP endpoints documentation. TLS encryption To ensure data security for our customers and to be in compliance with FedRAMP and other standards for data encryption, Transport Layer Security (TLS) is required for all domains. Our preferred protocol for all domains is TLS 1.2. For more information, see New Relic's Explorers Hub post about TLS 1.2. In addition, TLS 1.2 is required for most domains, except: APM agent connections Browser agent connections Event API For future updates to required and supported protocol versions, follow the Security Notifications tag in New Relic's Explorers Hub. User-facing domains Update your allow list to ensure New Relic can communicate with a number of integral domains that are listed in this section. Blocking domains can cause issues with individual product features or prevent pages from loading altogether. This list doesn't cover domains that New Relic connects to that can be blocked without affecting your usage of the product. It also doesn't cover Nerdpacks or other features that communicate with external services that have additional domain requirements. If your organization uses a firewall that restricts outbound traffic, follow the specific procedures for the operating system and the firewall you use to add the following domains to the allow list.

New Relic agents require your firewall to allow outgoing connections to the following networks and ports. To add the following IP connections to the allow list, follow the specific procedures for the operating system and the firewall you use. TLS is required for all domains. Use the IP connections for account data in the US or European Union region as appropriate: IP connections APM data Networks US region accounts: 162.247.240.0/22 EU region accounts: 185.221.84.0/22 Ports US region accounts: Default: TCP 443 (recommended) TCP 80 EU region accounts: Default: TCP 443 (recommended) TCP 80 Endpoints US region accounts: collector*.newrelic.com EU region accounts: collector*.eu01.nr-data.net:443 (recommended) Port 443 recommended Recommendation: Use port 443, a secured channel for encrypted HTTPS traffic. Some New Relic agents also offer port 80, an unsecured channel open to all HTTP traffic. While some agents can be configured to use both port 80 and port 443, we recommend that you choose the port 443 (default). If you have an existing configuration that uses port 80, you can update it to use port 443, the default New Relic connection. Agent downloads TLS is required for all domains.

If the Diagnostics CLI detects a problem, it suggests troubleshooting steps. The Diagnostics CLI can automatically upload troubleshooting data to a New Relic account. The Diagnostics CLI is open source and is located in GitHub. For additional troubleshooting steps for your agent, check out Not seeing data. Here's an example of the Diagnostics CLI running on Ubuntu Linux. The program checks your New Relic agent configurations for issues and generates zipped troubleshooting logs that are ready to be attached to support tickets. Compatibility The Diagnostics CLI is available for Linux, macOS, and Windows. It can detect common configuration issues for: APM: Available for all APM agents except C SDK. For the Go agent, only basic connectivity checks are available. Browser monitoring: Browser agent detection Infrastructure monitoring: Linux and Windows agents Mobile agents: iOS and Android Synthetic monitoring: Containerized private minions (CPM) The Diagnostics CLI does not require superuser or admin permissions to run, although we recommend those permissions for some checks. It will return an error if it does not have permissions to read the files it scans. Get started To use the Diagnostics CLI: Run the Diagnostics CLI, including task suites and command line options as needed. Supply the -attach flag for uploading results to your New Relic account. Optional: Validate your config file settings. Interpret the output. Like any other New Relic tool, the Diagnostics CLI service is designed to protect you and your customers' data privacy.

      "body": "This list is current. Last updated September 28, 2021. This is a list of the networks, IP addresses, domains, ports, and endpoints used by API clients or agents to communicate with New Relic. TLS is required for all domains. Your browser must be able to communicate with a number of domains for New Relic One to work properly. See User-facing domains for the list of domains to be allowed through your firewall. For information on our FedRAMP endpoints, see our FedRAMP endpoints documentation. TLS encryption To ensure data security for our customers and to be in compliance with FedRAMP and other standards for data encryption, Transport Layer Security (TLS) is required for all domains. Our preferred protocol for all domains is TLS 1.2. For more information, see New Relic's Explorers Hub post about TLS 1.2. In addition, TLS 1.2 is required for most domains, except: APM agent connections Browser agent connections Event API For future updates to required and supported protocol versions, follow the Security Notifications tag in New Relic's Explorers Hub. User-facing domains Update your allow list to ensure New Relic can communicate with a number of integral domains that are listed in this section. Blocking domains can cause issues with individual product features or prevent pages from loading altogether. This list doesn't cover domains that New Relic connects to that can be blocked without affecting your usage of the product. It also doesn't cover Nerdpacks or other features that communicate with external services that have additional domain requirements. If your organization uses a firewall that restricts outbound traffic, follow the specific procedures for the operating system and the firewall you use to add the following domains to the allow list. Domain Description *.newrelic.com New Relic One and supporting services *.nr-assets.net Static New Relic assets *.nr-ext.net New Relic One Nerdpacks and assets *.amazonaws.com New Relic One catalog assets behind AWS S3 *.cloudfront.net Static New Relic assets behind AWS CloudFront CDN secure.gravatar.com Support for Gravatar avatars fonts.googleapis.com Support for Google Fonts fonts.gstatic.com Support for Google Fonts www.google.com Support for reCAPTCHA www.gstatic.com Support for reCAPTCHA *.nr-data.net OpenTelemetry and Pixie APM agents To enhance network performance and data security, New Relic uses a CDN and DDoS prevention service with a large IP range. New Relic agents require your firewall to allow outgoing connections to the following networks and ports. To add the following IP connections to the allow list, follow the specific procedures for the operating system and the firewall you use. TLS is required for all domains. Use the IP connections for account data in the US or European Union region as appropriate: IP connections APM data Networks US region accounts: 162.247.240.0/22 EU region accounts: 185.221.84.0/22 Ports US region accounts: Default: TCP 443 (recommended) TCP 80 EU region accounts: Default: TCP 443 (recommended) TCP 80 Endpoints US region accounts: collector*.newrelic.com EU region accounts: collector*.eu01.nr-data.net:443 (recommended) Port 443 recommended Recommendation: Use port 443, a secured channel for encrypted HTTPS traffic. Some New Relic agents also offer port 80, an unsecured channel open to all HTTP traffic. While some agents can be configured to use both port 80 and port 443, we recommend that you choose the port 443 (default). If you have an existing configuration that uses port 80, you can update it to use port 443, the default New Relic connection. Agent downloads TLS is required for all domains. Service for download.newrelic.com is provided through Fastly and is subject to change without warning. For the most current list of public IP addresses for New Relic agent downloads, see api.fastly.com/public-ip-list. Infrastructure agents In order to report data to New Relic, our infrastructure monitoring needs outbound access to these domains, networks, and ports. TLS is required for all domains. Use the IP connections for account data in the US or European Union region as appropriate: IP connections Infrastructure data Domains infra-api.newrelic.com: Required to submit events, metrics, and inventory data. identity-api.newrelic.com: Required for entity registration (for example, a host entity). infrastructure-command-api.newrelic.com: Required to determine feature flags. Also used for gradual rollout of new capabilities. log-api.newrelic.com: Required to submit logs to a US datacenter. log-api.eu.newrelic.com: Required to submit logs to an EU datacenter. metric-api.newrelic.com: Required to submit dimensional metrics. Networks For US region accounts: 162.247.240.0/22 For EU region accounts: 185.221.84.0/22 Port 443 Domains + Port For US region accounts: infra-api.newrelic.com:443 identity-api.newrelic.com:443 infrastructure-command-api.newrelic.com:443 log-api.newrelic.com:443 metric-api.newrelic.com:443 For EU region accounts: infra-api.eu.newrelic.com:443 identity-api.eu.newrelic.com:443 infrastructure-command-api.eu.newrelic.com:443 log-api.eu.newrelic.com:443 metric-api.eu.newrelic.com:443 Proxy If your system needs a proxy to connect to this domain, use the Infrastructure proxy setting. Browser domains In addition to the IP addresses for APM agents, applications monitored by our browser agents use outgoing connections to the following domains. TLS is required for all domains. Use the IP connections for account data in the US or European Union region as appropriate: For US region accounts: bam.nr-data.net js-agent.newrelic.com For EU region accounts: eu01.nr-data.net bam.eu01.nr-data.net For more information about CDN access for the js-agent.newrelic.com file to the domain bam.nr-data.net or to one of the New Relic beacons, see Security for browser monitoring. Mobile domains In addition to the IP addresses for APM agents, applications monitored by our mobile agents use outgoing connections to the following domains. TLS is required for all domains. Use the IP connections for account data in the US or European Union region as appropriate: For US region accounts: mobile-collector.newrelic.com mobile-crash.newrelic.com mobile-symbol-upload.newrelic.com For EU region accounts: mobile-collector.eu01.nr-data.net mobile-crash.eu01.nr-data.net mobile-symbol-upload.eu01.nr-data.net Synthetic monitor public locations To configure your firewall to allow synthetic monitors to access your monitored URL, use Synthetic public minion IPs. TLS is required for all domains. Synthetic monitor private locations Synthetic private minions report to a specific endpoint based on region. To allow the private minion to access the endpoint or the static IP addresses associated with the endpoint, follow the specific procedures for the operating system and the firewall you use. These IP addresses may change in the future. TLS is required for all domains. Use the IP connections for account data in the US or European Union region as appropriate: IP connections Synthetics private location data Endpoint For US region accounts: https://synthetics-horde.nr-data.net/ For EU region accounts: https://synthetics-horde.eu01.nr-data.net/ IP addresses For US region accounts: 13.248.153.51 76.223.21.185 For EU region accounts: 185.221.86.57 185.221.86.25 Alerts webhooks, api.newrelic.com, cloud integrations, and ticketing integrations Endpoints that use api.newrelic.com (such as our GraphQL API for NerdGraph) and our New Relic-generated webhooks for alert policies use an IP address from designated network blocks for the US or European Union region. TLS is required for all addresses in these blocks. Network blocks for US region accounts: 162.247.240.0/22 Network blocks for EU region accounts: 158.177.65.64/29 159.122.103.184/29 161.156.125.32/28 These network blocks also apply to third-party ticketing integrations and New Relic cloud integrations. Pixie integration The Pixie integration runs in your Kubernetes cluster and pulls a set of curated observability data from Pixie to send it to New Relic using the OpenTelemetry line protocol. The Pixie integration requires outbound network access to the following: work.withpixie.ai:443 otlp.nr-data.net:4317 (US region accounts) otlp.eu01.nr-data.net:4317 (EU region accounts) OpenTelemetry New Relic supports the native OpenTelemetry Protocol (OTLP) for exporting telemetry data. This allows you to use the vendor neutral components developed by the OpenTelemetry community to export your data to New Relic. To export OTLP data to New Relic, configure the OTLP exporter to add a header ( api-key ) whose value is your account license key. And, based on your region, configure the endpoint where the exporter sends data to New Relic. See the OpenTelemetry quick start for more information. otlp.nr-data.net:4317 (US region accounts) otlp.eu01.nr-data.net:4317 (EU region accounts) Network blocks for US region accounts: 162.247.240.0/22 Network blocks for EU region accounts: 185.221.84.0/22",

If the Diagnostics CLI detects a problem, it suggests troubleshooting steps. The Diagnostics CLI can automatically upload troubleshooting data to a New Relic account. The Diagnostics CLI is open source and is located in GitHub. For additional troubleshooting steps for your agent, check out Not seeing data. Here's an example of the Diagnostics CLI running on Ubuntu Linux. The program checks your New Relic agent configurations for issues and generates zipped troubleshooting logs that are ready to be attached to support tickets. Compatibility The Diagnostics CLI is available for Linux, macOS, and Windows. It can detect common configuration issues for: APM: Available for all APM agents except C SDK. For the Go agent, only basic connectivity checks are available. Browser monitoring: Browser agent detection Infrastructure monitoring: Linux and Windows agents Mobile agents: iOS and Android Synthetic monitoring: Containerized private minions (CPM) The Diagnostics CLI does not require superuser or admin permissions to run, although we recommend those permissions for some checks. It will return an error if it does not have permissions to read the files it scans. Get started To use the Diagnostics CLI: Run the Diagnostics CLI, including task suites and command line options as needed. Supply the -attach flag for uploading results to your New Relic account. Optional: Validate your config file settings. Interpret the output. Like any other New Relic tool, the Diagnostics CLI service is designed to protect you and your customers' data privacy.

      "body": "This list is current. Last updated September 28, 2021. This is a list of the networks, IP addresses, domains, ports, and endpoints used by API clients or agents to communicate with New Relic. TLS is required for all domains. Your browser must be able to communicate with a number of domains for New Relic One to work properly. See User-facing domains for the list of domains to be allowed through your firewall. For information on our FedRAMP endpoints, see our FedRAMP endpoints documentation. TLS encryption To ensure data security for our customers and to be in compliance with FedRAMP and other standards for data encryption, Transport Layer Security (TLS) is required for all domains. Our preferred protocol for all domains is TLS 1.2. For more information, see New Relic's Explorers Hub post about TLS 1.2. In addition, TLS 1.2 is required for most domains, except: APM agent connections Browser agent connections Event API For future updates to required and supported protocol versions, follow the Security Notifications tag in New Relic's Explorers Hub. User-facing domains Update your allow list to ensure New Relic can communicate with a number of integral domains that are listed in this section. Blocking domains can cause issues with individual product features or prevent pages from loading altogether. This list doesn't cover domains that New Relic connects to that can be blocked without affecting your usage of the product. It also doesn't cover Nerdpacks or other features that communicate with external services that have additional domain requirements. If your organization uses a firewall that restricts outbound traffic, follow the specific procedures for the operating system and the firewall you use to add the following domains to the allow list. Domain Description *.newrelic.com New Relic One and supporting services *.nr-assets.net Static New Relic assets *.nr-ext.net New Relic One Nerdpacks and assets *.amazonaws.com New Relic One catalog assets behind AWS S3 *.cloudfront.net Static New Relic assets behind AWS CloudFront CDN secure.gravatar.com Support for Gravatar avatars fonts.googleapis.com Support for Google Fonts fonts.gstatic.com Support for Google Fonts www.google.com Support for reCAPTCHA www.gstatic.com Support for reCAPTCHA *.nr-data.net OpenTelemetry and Pixie APM agents To enhance network performance and data security, New Relic uses a CDN and DDoS prevention service with a large IP range. New Relic agents require your firewall to allow outgoing connections to the following networks and ports. To add the following IP connections to the allow list, follow the specific procedures for the operating system and the firewall you use. TLS is required for all domains. Use the IP connections for account data in the US or European Union region as appropriate: IP connections APM data Networks US region accounts: 162.247.240.0/22 EU region accounts: 185.221.84.0/22 Ports US region accounts: Default: TCP 443 (recommended) TCP 80 EU region accounts: Default: TCP 443 (recommended) TCP 80 Endpoints US region accounts: collector*.newrelic.com EU region accounts: collector*.eu01.nr-data.net:443 (recommended) Port 443 recommended Recommendation: Use port 443, a secured channel for encrypted HTTPS traffic. Some New Relic agents also offer port 80, an unsecured channel open to all HTTP traffic. While some agents can be configured to use both port 80 and port 443, we recommend that you choose the port 443 (default). If you have an existing configuration that uses port 80, you can update it to use port 443, the default New Relic connection. Agent downloads TLS is required for all domains. Service for download.newrelic.com is provided through Fastly and is subject to change without warning. For the most current list of public IP addresses for New Relic agent downloads, see api.fastly.com/public-ip-list. Infrastructure agents In order to report data to New Relic, our infrastructure monitoring needs outbound access to these domains, networks, and ports. TLS is required for all domains. Use the IP connections for account data in the US or European Union region as appropriate: IP connections Infrastructure data Domains infra-api.newrelic.com: Required to submit events, metrics, and inventory data. identity-api.newrelic.com: Required for entity registration (for example, a host entity). infrastructure-command-api.newrelic.com: Required to determine feature flags. Also used for gradual rollout of new capabilities. log-api.newrelic.com: Required to submit logs to a US datacenter. log-api.eu.newrelic.com: Required to submit logs to an EU datacenter. metric-api.newrelic.com: Required to submit dimensional metrics. Networks For US region accounts: 162.247.240.0/22 For EU region accounts: 185.221.84.0/22 Port 443 Domains + Port For US region accounts: infra-api.newrelic.com:443 identity-api.newrelic.com:443 infrastructure-command-api.newrelic.com:443 log-api.newrelic.com:443 metric-api.newrelic.com:443 For EU region accounts: infra-api.eu.newrelic.com:443 identity-api.eu.newrelic.com:443 infrastructure-command-api.eu.newrelic.com:443 log-api.eu.newrelic.com:443 metric-api.eu.newrelic.com:443 Proxy If your system needs a proxy to connect to this domain, use the Infrastructure proxy setting. Browser domains In addition to the IP addresses for APM agents, applications monitored by our browser agents use outgoing connections to the following domains. TLS is required for all domains. Use the IP connections for account data in the US or European Union region as appropriate: For US region accounts: bam.nr-data.net js-agent.newrelic.com For EU region accounts: eu01.nr-data.net bam.eu01.nr-data.net For more information about CDN access for the js-agent.newrelic.com file to the domain bam.nr-data.net or to one of the New Relic beacons, see Security for browser monitoring. Mobile domains In addition to the IP addresses for APM agents, applications monitored by our mobile agents use outgoing connections to the following domains. TLS is required for all domains. Use the IP connections for account data in the US or European Union region as appropriate: For US region accounts: mobile-collector.newrelic.com mobile-crash.newrelic.com mobile-symbol-upload.newrelic.com For EU region accounts: mobile-collector.eu01.nr-data.net mobile-crash.eu01.nr-data.net mobile-symbol-upload.eu01.nr-data.net Synthetic monitor public locations To configure your firewall to allow synthetic monitors to access your monitored URL, use Synthetic public minion IPs. TLS is required for all domains. Synthetic monitor private locations Synthetic private minions report to a specific endpoint based on region. To allow the private minion to access the endpoint or the static IP addresses associated with the endpoint, follow the specific procedures for the operating system and the firewall you use. These IP addresses may change in the future. TLS is required for all domains. Use the IP connections for account data in the US or European Union region as appropriate: IP connections Synthetics private location data Endpoint For US region accounts: https://synthetics-horde.nr-data.net/ For EU region accounts: https://synthetics-horde.eu01.nr-data.net/ IP addresses For US region accounts: 13.248.153.51 76.223.21.185 For EU region accounts: 185.221.86.57 185.221.86.25 Alerts webhooks, api.newrelic.com, cloud integrations, and ticketing integrations Endpoints that use api.newrelic.com (such as our GraphQL API for NerdGraph) and our New Relic-generated webhooks for alert policies use an IP address from designated network blocks for the US or European Union region. TLS is required for all addresses in these blocks. Network blocks for US region accounts: 162.247.240.0/22 Network blocks for EU region accounts: 158.177.65.64/29 159.122.103.184/29 161.156.125.32/28 These network blocks also apply to third-party ticketing integrations and New Relic cloud integrations. Pixie integration The Pixie integration runs in your Kubernetes cluster and pulls a set of curated observability data from Pixie to send it to New Relic using the OpenTelemetry line protocol. The Pixie integration requires outbound network access to the following: work.withpixie.ai:443 otlp.nr-data.net:4317 (US region accounts) otlp.eu01.nr-data.net:4317 (EU region accounts) OpenTelemetry New Relic supports the native OpenTelemetry Protocol (OTLP) for exporting telemetry data. This allows you to use the vendor neutral components developed by the OpenTelemetry community to export your data to New Relic. To export OTLP data to New Relic, configure the OTLP exporter to add a header ( api-key ) whose value is your account license key. And, based on your region, configure the endpoint where the exporter sends data to New Relic. See the OpenTelemetry quick start for more information. otlp.nr-data.net:4317 (US region accounts) otlp.eu01.nr-data.net:4317 (EU region accounts) Network blocks for US region accounts: 162.247.240.0/22 Network blocks for EU region accounts: 185.221.84.0/22",

If the Diagnostics CLI detects a problem, it suggests troubleshooting steps. The Diagnostics CLI can automatically upload troubleshooting data to a New Relic account. The Diagnostics CLI is open source and is located in GitHub. For additional troubleshooting steps for your agent, check out Not seeing data. Here's an example of the Diagnostics CLI running on Ubuntu Linux. The program checks your New Relic agent configurations for issues and generates zipped troubleshooting logs that are ready to be attached to support tickets. Compatibility The Diagnostics CLI is available for Linux, macOS, and Windows. It can detect common configuration issues for: APM: Available for all APM agents except C SDK. For the Go agent, only basic connectivity checks are available. Browser monitoring: Browser agent detection Infrastructure monitoring: Linux and Windows agents Mobile agents: iOS and Android Synthetic monitoring: Containerized private minions (CPM) The Diagnostics CLI does not require superuser or admin permissions to run, although we recommend those permissions for some checks. It will return an error if it does not have permissions to read the files it scans. Get started To use the Diagnostics CLI: Run the Diagnostics CLI, including task suites and command line options as needed. Supply the -attach flag for uploading results to your New Relic account. Optional: Validate your config file settings. Interpret the output. Like any other New Relic tool, the Diagnostics CLI service is designed to protect you and your customers' data privacy.

      "body": "This list is current. Last updated September 28, 2021. This is a list of the networks, IP addresses, domains, ports, and endpoints used by API clients or agents to communicate with New Relic. TLS is required for all domains. Your browser must be able to communicate with a number of domains for New Relic One to work properly. See User-facing domains for the list of domains to be allowed through your firewall. For information on our FedRAMP endpoints, see our FedRAMP endpoints documentation. TLS encryption To ensure data security for our customers and to be in compliance with FedRAMP and other standards for data encryption, Transport Layer Security (TLS) is required for all domains. Our preferred protocol for all domains is TLS 1.2. For more information, see New Relic's Explorers Hub post about TLS 1.2. In addition, TLS 1.2 is required for most domains, except: APM agent connections Browser agent connections Event API For future updates to required and supported protocol versions, follow the Security Notifications tag in New Relic's Explorers Hub. User-facing domains Update your allow list to ensure New Relic can communicate with a number of integral domains that are listed in this section. Blocking domains can cause issues with individual product features or prevent pages from loading altogether. This list doesn't cover domains that New Relic connects to that can be blocked without affecting your usage of the product. It also doesn't cover Nerdpacks or other features that communicate with external services that have additional domain requirements. If your organization uses a firewall that restricts outbound traffic, follow the specific procedures for the operating system and the firewall you use to add the following domains to the allow list. Domain Description *.newrelic.com New Relic One and supporting services *.nr-assets.net Static New Relic assets *.nr-ext.net New Relic One Nerdpacks and assets *.amazonaws.com New Relic One catalog assets behind AWS S3 *.cloudfront.net Static New Relic assets behind AWS CloudFront CDN secure.gravatar.com Support for Gravatar avatars fonts.googleapis.com Support for Google Fonts fonts.gstatic.com Support for Google Fonts www.google.com Support for reCAPTCHA www.gstatic.com Support for reCAPTCHA *.nr-data.net OpenTelemetry and Pixie APM agents To enhance network performance and data security, New Relic uses a CDN and DDoS prevention service with a large IP range. New Relic agents require your firewall to allow outgoing connections to the following networks and ports. To add the following IP connections to the allow list, follow the specific procedures for the operating system and the firewall you use. TLS is required for all domains. Use the IP connections for account data in the US or European Union region as appropriate: IP connections APM data Networks US region accounts: 162.247.240.0/22 EU region accounts: 185.221.84.0/22 Ports US region accounts: Default: TCP 443 (recommended) TCP 80 EU region accounts: Default: TCP 443 (recommended) TCP 80 Endpoints US region accounts: collector*.newrelic.com EU region accounts: collector*.eu01.nr-data.net:443 (recommended) Port 443 recommended Recommendation: Use port 443, a secured channel for encrypted HTTPS traffic. Some New Relic agents also offer port 80, an unsecured channel open to all HTTP traffic. While some agents can be configured to use both port 80 and port 443, we recommend that you choose the port 443 (default). If you have an existing configuration that uses port 80, you can update it to use port 443, the default New Relic connection. Agent downloads TLS is required for all domains. Service for download.newrelic.com is provided through Fastly and is subject to change without warning. For the most current list of public IP addresses for New Relic agent downloads, see api.fastly.com/public-ip-list.

For information on our FedRAMP endpoints, see our FedRAMP endpoints documentation. TLS encryption To ensure data security for our customers and to be in compliance with FedRAMP and other standards for data encryption, Transport Layer Security (TLS) is required for all domains. Our preferred protocol for all domains is TLS 1.2. For more information, see New Relic's Explorers Hub post about TLS 1.2. In addition, TLS 1.2 is required for most domains, except: APM agent connections Browser agent connections Event API For future updates to required and supported protocol versions, follow the Security Notifications tag in New Relic's Explorers Hub. User-facing domains Update your allow list to ensure New Relic can communicate with a number of integral domains that are listed in this section. Blocking domains can cause issues with individual product features or prevent pages from loading altogether. This list doesn't cover domains that New Relic connects to that can be blocked without affecting your usage of the product. It also doesn't cover Nerdpacks or other features that communicate with external services that have additional domain requirements.

      "body": "For some New Relic solutions, one way to report custom data to New Relic is to use custom attributes. For example, for New Relic browser monitoring, you might create a custom attribute to track the user name associated with a slow or failing request. Requirements Custom attributes are available for these New Relic solutions: APM Browser monitoring Mobile monitoring Infrastructure monitoring For other custom data solutions, see Intro to custom data. APM: Record custom attributes Important Review the list of reserved terms used by NRQL. Using reserved terms can cause issues. To enable and use custom attributes for APM, follow the procedure for your APM agent: C SDK To add custom attributes to applications monitored by the C SDK, call one of the attribute functions; for example, newrelic_add_attribute_double(). The key name for your custom attribute depends on what you specify when you call the function. Go Custom attribute collection is enabled by default in the Go agent. However, you can disable custom attribute collection. Java Custom attribute collection is enabled by default in Java. You can collect custom attributes using XML and the Java agent APIs. These two methods can be used in conjunction with each other. Method How to do it Specify attributes in XML XML allows you to specify custom attributes without changing any of your source code. You can have multiple XML files for custom attributes that are grouped by some logical facet. To set custom attributes for your Java app via XML: Review the New Relic Java agent's documentation about XML file format, methods and classes, and examples. From your Extensions directory within the New Relic Java agent, create a single XML file. Define the methods you want New Relic to monitor by editing your XML file directly. Define an XML instrumentation file using the New Relic UI. This may require additional config in the common: block of your newrelic.yml. See Report custom attributes under Instrumentation options for more detail. Call the agent's API Example 1: Adding custom attributes to transactions To collect custom attributes using the agent's API, call the relevant methods: For each method you want to record an attribute for, call NewRelic.addCustomParameter(...). Optional: Include or exclude certain attributes with attributes.include and attributes.exclude. For example, to record a variable named userId, include this code in the parent method: NewRelic.addCustomParameter(\"userId\", userId); Copy Example 2: Adding custom attributes to spans in distributed traces To collect custom attributes using the agent's API, call the relevant methods: For each span (currently executing method) that you want to record an attribute for, call NewRelic.getAgent().getTracedMethod().addCustomAttribute(...). Optional: Include or exclude certain attributes with span_events.attributes.include and span_events.attributes.exclude. For example, to record a variable named userId on the current span, include this code in the associated method: NewRelic.getAgent().getTracedMethod().addCustomAttribute(\"userId\", userId); Copy Collect user attributes The Java agent also includes a built-in mechanism to enable user attributes and collect user information from HttpServletRequest.getUserPrincipal() as custom attributes. .NET Custom attribute collection is enabled by default in .NET. To collect custom attributes, call the relevant API methods: For each method for which you want to record an attribute, call AddCustomAttribute. Optional: Include or exclude attributes with the include and exclude configuration options. For example, to record attributes for a coupon code (string) and an item ID code (number), you could include this code in the parent method: IAgent agent = NewRelic.Api.Agent.NewRelic.GetAgent(); ITransaction transaction = agent.CurrentTransaction; transaction .AddCustomAttribute(\"Discount Code\", \"Summer Super Sale\") .AddCustomAttribute(\"Item Code\", 31456); Copy Node.js Custom attribute collection is enabled by default in Node.js. To collect custom attributes, call the relevant API method: For each attribute you want to record, call newrelic.addCustomAttribute. To record multiple attributes using a single call, use newrelic.addCustomAttributes. For example, to record attributes for a coupon code and an item ID code, you could include this in the parent method: newrelic.addCustomAttributes({ \"Discount Code\": \"Summer Super Sale\", \"Item Code\": 31456 }); Copy PHP Custom attribute collection is enabled by default in PHP. To collect custom attributes, call the relevant API method for each method that you want to record an attribute; newrelic_add_custom_parameter for transaction events and spans newrelic_add_custom_span_parameter for only spans For example, to record a variable named $userId, include this code in the parent method: newrelic_add_custom_parameter ('userID', $userId) Copy Python Custom attribute collection is enabled by default in Python. To collect custom attributes, call add_custom_parameter for each method that you want to record an attribute. For example, to record a variable named user_id, include this code in the parent method: newrelic.agent.add_custom_parameter('user_id', user_id) Copy Ruby Custom attribute collection is enabled by default in Ruby. To collect custom attributes, call the relevant API methods: For Ruby agent version 3.12.0 or higher, use the add_custom_attributes method. For example, to record a variable named @user_id, include this code in the parent method: ::NewRelic::Agent.add_custom_attributes({ user_id: @user.id }) Copy For Ruby agent version 3.11.2 or lower, use the add_custom_parameters method. For example, to record a variable named @user_id, include this code in the parent method: ::NewRelic::Agent.add_custom_parameters({ user_id: @user.id }) Copy Browser monitoring: Record custom attributes The browser agent provides an API to specify extra details associated with a page view or browser interaction, either by forwarding attributes from APM to browser monitoring or by specifying custom attributes through JavaScript. Values forwarded from the APM agent are encoded and injected into browser attributes by our browser agent. Infrastructure monitoring: Record custom attributes Our Infrastructure monitoring lets you create custom attributes that are used to annotate the data from the infrastructure agent. You can use this metadata to build filter sets, group your results, and annotate your data. Mobile monitoring: Record custom attributes Mobile agents include API calls to record custom attributes: For an overview of mobile monitoring custom data, see Insert custom events and attributes Android method: setAttribute iOS method: setAttribute",

      "body": "For some New Relic solutions, one way to report custom data to New Relic is to use custom attributes. For example, for New Relic browser monitoring, you might create a custom attribute to track the user name associated with a slow or failing request. Requirements Custom attributes are available for these New Relic solutions: APM Browser monitoring Mobile monitoring Infrastructure monitoring For other custom data solutions, see Intro to custom data. APM: Record custom attributes Important Review the list of reserved terms used by NRQL. Using reserved terms can cause issues. To enable and use custom attributes for APM, follow the procedure for your APM agent: C SDK To add custom attributes to applications monitored by the C SDK, call one of the attribute functions; for example, newrelic_add_attribute_double(). The key name for your custom attribute depends on what you specify when you call the function. Go Custom attribute collection is enabled by default in the Go agent. However, you can disable custom attribute collection. Java Custom attribute collection is enabled by default in Java. You can collect custom attributes using XML and the Java agent APIs. These two methods can be used in conjunction with each other. Method How to do it Specify attributes in XML XML allows you to specify custom attributes without changing any of your source code. You can have multiple XML files for custom attributes that are grouped by some logical facet. To set custom attributes for your Java app via XML: Review the New Relic Java agent's documentation about XML file format, methods and classes, and examples. From your Extensions directory within the New Relic Java agent, create a single XML file. Define the methods you want New Relic to monitor by editing your XML file directly. Define an XML instrumentation file using the New Relic UI. This may require additional config in the common: block of your newrelic.yml. See Report custom attributes under Instrumentation options for more detail. Call the agent's API Example 1: Adding custom attributes to transactions To collect custom attributes using the agent's API, call the relevant methods: For each method you want to record an attribute for, call NewRelic.addCustomParameter(...). Optional: Include or exclude certain attributes with attributes.include and attributes.exclude. For example, to record a variable named userId, include this code in the parent method: NewRelic.addCustomParameter(\"userId\", userId); Copy Example 2: Adding custom attributes to spans in distributed traces To collect custom attributes using the agent's API, call the relevant methods: For each span (currently executing method) that you want to record an attribute for, call NewRelic.getAgent().getTracedMethod().addCustomAttribute(...). Optional: Include or exclude certain attributes with span_events.attributes.include and span_events.attributes.exclude. For example, to record a variable named userId on the current span, include this code in the associated method: NewRelic.getAgent().getTracedMethod().addCustomAttribute(\"userId\", userId); Copy Collect user attributes The Java agent also includes a built-in mechanism to enable user attributes and collect user information from HttpServletRequest.getUserPrincipal() as custom attributes. .NET Custom attribute collection is enabled by default in .NET. To collect custom attributes, call the relevant API methods: For each method for which you want to record an attribute, call AddCustomAttribute. Optional: Include or exclude attributes with the include and exclude configuration options. For example, to record attributes for a coupon code (string) and an item ID code (number), you could include this code in the parent method: IAgent agent = NewRelic.Api.Agent.NewRelic.GetAgent(); ITransaction transaction = agent.CurrentTransaction; transaction .AddCustomAttribute(\"Discount Code\", \"Summer Super Sale\") .AddCustomAttribute(\"Item Code\", 31456); Copy Node.js Custom attribute collection is enabled by default in Node.js. To collect custom attributes, call the relevant API method: For each attribute you want to record, call newrelic.addCustomAttribute. To record multiple attributes using a single call, use newrelic.addCustomAttributes. For example, to record attributes for a coupon code and an item ID code, you could include this in the parent method: newrelic.addCustomAttributes({ \"Discount Code\": \"Summer Super Sale\", \"Item Code\": 31456 }); Copy PHP Custom attribute collection is enabled by default in PHP. To collect custom attributes, call the relevant API method for each method that you want to record an attribute; newrelic_add_custom_parameter for transaction events and spans newrelic_add_custom_span_parameter for only spans For example, to record a variable named $userId, include this code in the parent method: newrelic_add_custom_parameter ('userID', $userId) Copy Python Custom attribute collection is enabled by default in Python. To collect custom attributes, call add_custom_parameter for each method that you want to record an attribute. For example, to record a variable named user_id, include this code in the parent method: newrelic.agent.add_custom_parameter('user_id', user_id) Copy Ruby Custom attribute collection is enabled by default in Ruby. To collect custom attributes, call the relevant API methods: For Ruby agent version 3.12.0 or higher, use the add_custom_attributes method. For example, to record a variable named @user_id, include this code in the parent method: ::NewRelic::Agent.add_custom_attributes({ user_id: @user.id }) Copy For Ruby agent version 3.11.2 or lower, use the add_custom_parameters method. For example, to record a variable named @user_id, include this code in the parent method: ::NewRelic::Agent.add_custom_parameters({ user_id: @user.id }) Copy Browser monitoring: Record custom attributes The browser agent provides an API to specify extra details associated with a page view or browser interaction, either by forwarding attributes from APM to browser monitoring or by specifying custom attributes through JavaScript. Values forwarded from the APM agent are encoded and injected into browser attributes by our browser agent. Infrastructure monitoring: Record custom attributes Our Infrastructure monitoring lets you create custom attributes that are used to annotate the data from the infrastructure agent. You can use this metadata to build filter sets, group your results, and annotate your data. Mobile monitoring: Record custom attributes Mobile agents include API calls to record custom attributes: For an overview of mobile monitoring custom data, see Insert custom events and attributes Android method: setAttribute iOS method: setAttribute",

      "body": "For some New Relic solutions, one way to report custom data to New Relic is to use custom attributes. For example, for New Relic browser monitoring, you might create a custom attribute to track the user name associated with a slow or failing request. Requirements Custom attributes are available for these New Relic solutions: APM Browser monitoring Mobile monitoring Infrastructure monitoring For other custom data solutions, see Intro to custom data. APM: Record custom attributes Important Review the list of reserved terms used by NRQL. Using reserved terms can cause issues. To enable and use custom attributes for APM, follow the procedure for your APM agent: C SDK To add custom attributes to applications monitored by the C SDK, call one of the attribute functions; for example, newrelic_add_attribute_double(). The key name for your custom attribute depends on what you specify when you call the function. Go Custom attribute collection is enabled by default in the Go agent. However, you can disable custom attribute collection. Java Custom attribute collection is enabled by default in Java. You can collect custom attributes using XML and the Java agent APIs. These two methods can be used in conjunction with each other. Method How to do it Specify attributes in XML XML allows you to specify custom attributes without changing any of your source code. You can have multiple XML files for custom attributes that are grouped by some logical facet. To set custom attributes for your Java app via XML: Review the New Relic Java agent's documentation about XML file format, methods and classes, and examples. From your Extensions directory within the New Relic Java agent, create a single XML file. Define the methods you want New Relic to monitor by editing your XML file directly. Define an XML instrumentation file using the New Relic UI. This may require additional config in the common: block of your newrelic.yml. See Report custom attributes under Instrumentation options for more detail. Call the agent's API Example 1: Adding custom attributes to transactions To collect custom attributes using the agent's API, call the relevant methods: For each method you want to record an attribute for, call NewRelic.addCustomParameter(...). Optional: Include or exclude certain attributes with attributes.include and attributes.exclude. For example, to record a variable named userId, include this code in the parent method: NewRelic.addCustomParameter(\"userId\", userId); Copy Example 2: Adding custom attributes to spans in distributed traces To collect custom attributes using the agent's API, call the relevant methods: For each span (currently executing method) that you want to record an attribute for, call NewRelic.getAgent().getTracedMethod().addCustomAttribute(...). Optional: Include or exclude certain attributes with span_events.attributes.include and span_events.attributes.exclude. For example, to record a variable named userId on the current span, include this code in the associated method: NewRelic.getAgent().getTracedMethod().addCustomAttribute(\"userId\", userId); Copy Collect user attributes The Java agent also includes a built-in mechanism to enable user attributes and collect user information from HttpServletRequest.getUserPrincipal() as custom attributes. .NET Custom attribute collection is enabled by default in .NET. To collect custom attributes, call the relevant API methods: For each method for which you want to record an attribute, call AddCustomAttribute. Optional: Include or exclude attributes with the include and exclude configuration options. For example, to record attributes for a coupon code (string) and an item ID code (number), you could include this code in the parent method: IAgent agent = NewRelic.Api.Agent.NewRelic.GetAgent(); ITransaction transaction = agent.CurrentTransaction; transaction .AddCustomAttribute(\"Discount Code\", \"Summer Super Sale\") .AddCustomAttribute(\"Item Code\", 31456); Copy Node.js Custom attribute collection is enabled by default in Node.js. To collect custom attributes, call the relevant API method: For each attribute you want to record, call newrelic.addCustomAttribute. To record multiple attributes using a single call, use newrelic.addCustomAttributes. For example, to record attributes for a coupon code and an item ID code, you could include this in the parent method: newrelic.addCustomAttributes({ \"Discount Code\": \"Summer Super Sale\", \"Item Code\": 31456 }); Copy PHP Custom attribute collection is enabled by default in PHP. To collect custom attributes, call the relevant API method for each method that you want to record an attribute; newrelic_add_custom_parameter for transaction events and spans newrelic_add_custom_span_parameter for only spans For example, to record a variable named $userId, include this code in the parent method: newrelic_add_custom_parameter ('userID', $userId) Copy Python Custom attribute collection is enabled by default in Python. To collect custom attributes, call add_custom_parameter for each method that you want to record an attribute. For example, to record a variable named user_id, include this code in the parent method: newrelic.agent.add_custom_parameter('user_id', user_id) Copy Ruby Custom attribute collection is enabled by default in Ruby. To collect custom attributes, call the relevant API methods: For Ruby agent version 3.12.0 or higher, use the add_custom_attributes method. For example, to record a variable named @user_id, include this code in the parent method: ::NewRelic::Agent.add_custom_attributes({ user_id: @user.id }) Copy For Ruby agent version 3.11.2 or lower, use the add_custom_parameters method. For example, to record a variable named @user_id, include this code in the parent method: ::NewRelic::Agent.add_custom_parameters({ user_id: @user.id }) Copy Browser monitoring: Record custom attributes The browser agent provides an API to specify extra details associated with a page view or browser interaction, either by forwarding attributes from APM to browser monitoring or by specifying custom attributes through JavaScript. Values forwarded from the APM agent are encoded and injected into browser attributes by our browser agent. Infrastructure monitoring: Record custom attributes Our Infrastructure monitoring lets you create custom attributes that are used to annotate the data from the infrastructure agent. You can use this metadata to build filter sets, group your results, and annotate your data. Mobile monitoring: Record custom attributes Mobile agents include API calls to record custom attributes: For an overview of mobile monitoring custom data, see Insert custom events and attributes Android method: setAttribute iOS method: setAttribute",

      "body": "For some New Relic solutions, one way to report custom data to New Relic is to use custom attributes. For example, for New Relic browser monitoring, you might create a custom attribute to track the user name associated with a slow or failing request. Requirements Custom attributes are available for these New Relic solutions: APM Browser monitoring Mobile monitoring Infrastructure monitoring For other custom data solutions, see Intro to custom data. APM: Record custom attributes Important Review the list of reserved terms used by NRQL. Using reserved terms can cause issues. To enable and use custom attributes for APM, follow the procedure for your APM agent: C SDK To add custom attributes to applications monitored by the C SDK, call one of the attribute functions; for example, newrelic_add_attribute_double(). The key name for your custom attribute depends on what you specify when you call the function. Go Custom attribute collection is enabled by default in the Go agent. However, you can disable custom attribute collection. Java Custom attribute collection is enabled by default in Java. You can collect custom attributes using XML and the Java agent APIs. These two methods can be used in conjunction with each other. Method How to do it Specify attributes in XML XML allows you to specify custom attributes without changing any of your source code. You can have multiple XML files for custom attributes that are grouped by some logical facet. To set custom attributes for your Java app via XML: Review the New Relic Java agent's documentation about XML file format, methods and classes, and examples. From your Extensions directory within the New Relic Java agent, create a single XML file. Define the methods you want New Relic to monitor by editing your XML file directly. Define an XML instrumentation file using the New Relic UI. This may require additional config in the common: block of your newrelic.yml. See Report custom attributes under Instrumentation options for more detail. Call the agent's API Example 1: Adding custom attributes to transactions To collect custom attributes using the agent's API, call the relevant methods: For each method you want to record an attribute for, call NewRelic.addCustomParameter(...). Optional: Include or exclude certain attributes with attributes.include and attributes.exclude. For example, to record a variable named userId, include this code in the parent method: NewRelic.addCustomParameter(\"userId\", userId); Copy Example 2: Adding custom attributes to spans in distributed traces To collect custom attributes using the agent's API, call the relevant methods: For each span (currently executing method) that you want to record an attribute for, call NewRelic.getAgent().getTracedMethod().addCustomAttribute(...). Optional: Include or exclude certain attributes with span_events.attributes.include and span_events.attributes.exclude. For example, to record a variable named userId on the current span, include this code in the associated method: NewRelic.getAgent().getTracedMethod().addCustomAttribute(\"userId\", userId); Copy Collect user attributes The Java agent also includes a built-in mechanism to enable user attributes and collect user information from HttpServletRequest.getUserPrincipal() as custom attributes. .NET Custom attribute collection is enabled by default in .NET. To collect custom attributes, call the relevant API methods: For each method for which you want to record an attribute, call AddCustomAttribute. Optional: Include or exclude attributes with the include and exclude configuration options. For example, to record attributes for a coupon code (string) and an item ID code (number), you could include this code in the parent method: IAgent agent = NewRelic.Api.Agent.NewRelic.GetAgent(); ITransaction transaction = agent.CurrentTransaction; transaction .AddCustomAttribute(\"Discount Code\", \"Summer Super Sale\") .AddCustomAttribute(\"Item Code\", 31456); Copy Node.js Custom attribute collection is enabled by default in Node.js. To collect custom attributes, call the relevant API method: For each attribute you want to record, call newrelic.addCustomAttribute. To record multiple attributes using a single call, use newrelic.addCustomAttributes. For example, to record attributes for a coupon code and an item ID code, you could include this in the parent method: newrelic.addCustomAttributes({ \"Discount Code\": \"Summer Super Sale\", \"Item Code\": 31456 }); Copy PHP Custom attribute collection is enabled by default in PHP. To collect custom attributes, call the relevant API method for each method that you want to record an attribute; newrelic_add_custom_parameter for transaction events and spans newrelic_add_custom_span_parameter for only spans For example, to record a variable named $userId, include this code in the parent method: newrelic_add_custom_parameter ('userID', $userId) Copy Python Custom attribute collection is enabled by default in Python. To collect custom attributes, call add_custom_parameter for each method that you want to record an attribute. For example, to record a variable named user_id, include this code in the parent method: newrelic.agent.add_custom_parameter('user_id', user_id) Copy Ruby Custom attribute collection is enabled by default in Ruby. To collect custom attributes, call the relevant API methods: For Ruby agent version 3.12.0 or higher, use the add_custom_attributes method. For example, to record a variable named @user_id, include this code in the parent method: ::NewRelic::Agent.add_custom_attributes({ user_id: @user.id }) Copy For Ruby agent version 3.11.2 or lower, use the add_custom_parameters method. For example, to record a variable named @user_id, include this code in the parent method: ::NewRelic::Agent.add_custom_parameters({ user_id: @user.id }) Copy Browser monitoring: Record custom attributes The browser agent provides an API to specify extra details associated with a page view or browser interaction, either by forwarding attributes from APM to browser monitoring or by specifying custom attributes through JavaScript. Values forwarded from the APM agent are encoded and injected into browser attributes by our browser agent. Infrastructure monitoring: Record custom attributes Our Infrastructure monitoring lets you create custom attributes that are used to annotate the data from the infrastructure agent. You can use this metadata to build filter sets, group your results, and annotate your data. Mobile monitoring: Record custom attributes Mobile agents include API calls to record custom attributes: For an overview of mobile monitoring custom data, see Insert custom events and attributes Android method: setAttribute iOS method: setAttribute",

      "body": "For some New Relic solutions, one way to report custom data to New Relic is to use custom attributes. For example, for New Relic browser monitoring, you might create a custom attribute to track the user name associated with a slow or failing request. Requirements Custom attributes are available for these New Relic solutions: APM Browser monitoring Mobile monitoring Infrastructure monitoring For other custom data solutions, see Intro to custom data. APM: Record custom attributes Important Review the list of reserved terms used by NRQL. Using reserved terms can cause issues. To enable and use custom attributes for APM, follow the procedure for your APM agent: C SDK To add custom attributes to applications monitored by the C SDK, call one of the attribute functions; for example, newrelic_add_attribute_double(). The key name for your custom attribute depends on what you specify when you call the function. Go Custom attribute collection is enabled by default in the Go agent. However, you can disable custom attribute collection. Java Custom attribute collection is enabled by default in Java. You can collect custom attributes using XML and the Java agent APIs. These two methods can be used in conjunction with each other. Method How to do it Specify attributes in XML XML allows you to specify custom attributes without changing any of your source code. You can have multiple XML files for custom attributes that are grouped by some logical facet. To set custom attributes for your Java app via XML: Review the New Relic Java agent's documentation about XML file format, methods and classes, and examples. From your Extensions directory within the New Relic Java agent, create a single XML file. Define the methods you want New Relic to monitor by editing your XML file directly. Define an XML instrumentation file using the New Relic UI. This may require additional config in the common: block of your newrelic.yml. See Report custom attributes under Instrumentation options for more detail. Call the agent's API Example 1: Adding custom attributes to transactions To collect custom attributes using the agent's API, call the relevant methods: For each method you want to record an attribute for, call NewRelic.addCustomParameter(...). Optional: Include or exclude certain attributes with attributes.include and attributes.exclude. For example, to record a variable named userId, include this code in the parent method: NewRelic.addCustomParameter(\"userId\", userId); Copy Example 2: Adding custom attributes to spans in distributed traces To collect custom attributes using the agent's API, call the relevant methods: For each span (currently executing method) that you want to record an attribute for, call NewRelic.getAgent().getTracedMethod().addCustomAttribute(...). Optional: Include or exclude certain attributes with span_events.attributes.include and span_events.attributes.exclude. For example, to record a variable named userId on the current span, include this code in the associated method: NewRelic.getAgent().getTracedMethod().addCustomAttribute(\"userId\", userId); Copy Collect user attributes The Java agent also includes a built-in mechanism to enable user attributes and collect user information from HttpServletRequest.getUserPrincipal() as custom attributes. .NET Custom attribute collection is enabled by default in .NET. To collect custom attributes, call the relevant API methods: For each method for which you want to record an attribute, call AddCustomAttribute. Optional: Include or exclude attributes with the include and exclude configuration options. For example, to record attributes for a coupon code (string) and an item ID code (number), you could include this code in the parent method: IAgent agent = NewRelic.Api.Agent.NewRelic.GetAgent(); ITransaction transaction = agent.CurrentTransaction; transaction .AddCustomAttribute(\"Discount Code\", \"Summer Super Sale\") .AddCustomAttribute(\"Item Code\", 31456); Copy Node.js Custom attribute collection is enabled by default in Node.js. To collect custom attributes, call the relevant API method: For each attribute you want to record, call newrelic.addCustomAttribute. To record multiple attributes using a single call, use newrelic.addCustomAttributes. For example, to record attributes for a coupon code and an item ID code, you could include this in the parent method: newrelic.addCustomAttributes({ \"Discount Code\": \"Summer Super Sale\", \"Item Code\": 31456 }); Copy PHP Custom attribute collection is enabled by default in PHP. To collect custom attributes, call the relevant API method for each method that you want to record an attribute; newrelic_add_custom_parameter for transaction events and spans newrelic_add_custom_span_parameter for only spans For example, to record a variable named $userId, include this code in the parent method: newrelic_add_custom_parameter ('userID', $userId) Copy Python Custom attribute collection is enabled by default in Python. To collect custom attributes, call add_custom_parameter for each method that you want to record an attribute. For example, to record a variable named user_id, include this code in the parent method: newrelic.agent.add_custom_parameter('user_id', user_id) Copy Ruby Custom attribute collection is enabled by default in Ruby. To collect custom attributes, call the relevant API methods: For Ruby agent version 3.12.0 or higher, use the add_custom_attributes method. For example, to record a variable named @user_id, include this code in the parent method: ::NewRelic::Agent.add_custom_attributes({ user_id: @user.id }) Copy For Ruby agent version 3.11.2 or lower, use the add_custom_parameters method. For example, to record a variable named @user_id, include this code in the parent method: ::NewRelic::Agent.add_custom_parameters({ user_id: @user.id }) Copy Browser monitoring: Record custom attributes The browser agent provides an API to specify extra details associated with a page view or browser interaction, either by forwarding attributes from APM to browser monitoring or by specifying custom attributes through JavaScript. Values forwarded from the APM agent are encoded and injected into browser attributes by our browser agent. Infrastructure monitoring: Record custom attributes Our Infrastructure monitoring lets you create custom attributes that are used to annotate the data from the infrastructure agent. You can use this metadata to build filter sets, group your results, and annotate your data. Mobile monitoring: Record custom attributes Mobile agents include API calls to record custom attributes: For an overview of mobile monitoring custom data, see Insert custom events and attributes Android method: setAttribute iOS method: setAttribute",

      "body": "This list is current. Last updated September 28, 2021. This is a list of the networks, IP addresses, domains, ports, and endpoints used by API clients or agents to communicate with New Relic. TLS is required for all domains. Your browser must be able to communicate with a number of domains for New Relic One to work properly. See User-facing domains for the list of domains to be allowed through your firewall. For information on our FedRAMP endpoints, see our FedRAMP endpoints documentation. TLS encryption To ensure data security for our customers and to be in compliance with FedRAMP and other standards for data encryption, Transport Layer Security (TLS) is required for all domains. Our preferred protocol for all domains is TLS 1.2. For more information, see New Relic's Explorers Hub post about TLS 1.2. In addition, TLS 1.2 is required for most domains, except: APM agent connections Browser agent connections Event API For future updates to required and supported protocol versions, follow the Security Notifications tag in New Relic's Explorers Hub. User-facing domains Update your allow list to ensure New Relic can communicate with a number of integral domains that are listed in this section. Blocking domains can cause issues with individual product features or prevent pages from loading altogether. This list doesn't cover domains that New Relic connects to that can be blocked without affecting your usage of the product. It also doesn't cover Nerdpacks or other features that communicate with external services that have additional domain requirements. If your organization uses a firewall that restricts outbound traffic, follow the specific procedures for the operating system and the firewall you use to add the following domains to the allow list. Domain Description *.newrelic.com New Relic One and supporting services *.nr-assets.net Static New Relic assets *.nr-ext.net New Relic One Nerdpacks and assets *.amazonaws.com New Relic One catalog assets behind AWS S3 *.cloudfront.net Static New Relic assets behind AWS CloudFront CDN secure.gravatar.com Support for Gravatar avatars fonts.googleapis.com Support for Google Fonts fonts.gstatic.com Support for Google Fonts www.google.com Support for reCAPTCHA www.gstatic.com Support for reCAPTCHA *.nr-data.net OpenTelemetry and Pixie APM agents To enhance network performance and data security, New Relic uses a CDN and DDoS prevention service with a large IP range. New Relic agents require your firewall to allow outgoing connections to the following networks and ports. To add the following IP connections to the allow list, follow the specific procedures for the operating system and the firewall you use. TLS is required for all domains. Use the IP connections for account data in the US or European Union region as appropriate: IP connections APM data Networks US region accounts: 162.247.240.0/22 EU region accounts: 185.221.84.0/22 Ports US region accounts: Default: TCP 443 (recommended) TCP 80 EU region accounts: Default: TCP 443 (recommended) TCP 80 Endpoints US region accounts: collector*.newrelic.com EU region accounts: collector*.eu01.nr-data.net:443 (recommended) Port 443 recommended Recommendation: Use port 443, a secured channel for encrypted HTTPS traffic. Some New Relic agents also offer port 80, an unsecured channel open to all HTTP traffic. While some agents can be configured to use both port 80 and port 443, we recommend that you choose the port 443 (default). If you have an existing configuration that uses port 80, you can update it to use port 443, the default New Relic connection. Agent downloads TLS is required for all domains.

      "body": "For some New Relic solutions, one way to report custom data to New Relic is to use custom attributes. For example, for New Relic browser monitoring, you might create a custom attribute to track the user name associated with a slow or failing request. Requirements Custom attributes are available for these New Relic solutions: APM Browser monitoring Mobile monitoring Infrastructure monitoring For other custom data solutions, see Intro to custom data. APM: Record custom attributes Important Review the list of reserved terms used by NRQL. Using reserved terms can cause issues. To enable and use custom attributes for APM, follow the procedure for your APM agent: C SDK To add custom attributes to applications monitored by the C SDK, call one of the attribute functions; for example, newrelic_add_attribute_double(). The key name for your custom attribute depends on what you specify when you call the function. Go Custom attribute collection is enabled by default in the Go agent. However, you can disable custom attribute collection. Java Custom attribute collection is enabled by default in Java. You can collect custom attributes using XML and the Java agent APIs. These two methods can be used in conjunction with each other. Method How to do it Specify attributes in XML XML allows you to specify custom attributes without changing any of your source code. You can have multiple XML files for custom attributes that are grouped by some logical facet. To set custom attributes for your Java app via XML: Review the New Relic Java agent's documentation about XML file format, methods and classes, and examples. From your Extensions directory within the New Relic Java agent, create a single XML file. Define the methods you want New Relic to monitor by editing your XML file directly. Define an XML instrumentation file using the New Relic UI. This may require additional config in the common: block of your newrelic.yml. See Report custom attributes under Instrumentation options for more detail. Call the agent's API Example 1: Adding custom attributes to transactions To collect custom attributes using the agent's API, call the relevant methods: For each method you want to record an attribute for, call NewRelic.addCustomParameter(...). Optional: Include or exclude certain attributes with attributes.include and attributes.exclude. For example, to record a variable named userId, include this code in the parent method: NewRelic.addCustomParameter(\"userId\", userId); Copy Example 2: Adding custom attributes to spans in distributed traces To collect custom attributes using the agent's API, call the relevant methods: For each span (currently executing method) that you want to record an attribute for, call NewRelic.getAgent().getTracedMethod().addCustomAttribute(...). Optional: Include or exclude certain attributes with span_events.attributes.include and span_events.attributes.exclude. For example, to record a variable named userId on the current span, include this code in the associated method: NewRelic.getAgent().getTracedMethod().addCustomAttribute(\"userId\", userId); Copy Collect user attributes The Java agent also includes a built-in mechanism to enable user attributes and collect user information from HttpServletRequest.getUserPrincipal() as custom attributes. .NET Custom attribute collection is enabled by default in .NET. To collect custom attributes, call the relevant API methods: For each method for which you want to record an attribute, call AddCustomAttribute. Optional: Include or exclude attributes with the include and exclude configuration options. For example, to record attributes for a coupon code (string) and an item ID code (number), you could include this code in the parent method: IAgent agent = NewRelic.Api.Agent.NewRelic.GetAgent(); ITransaction transaction = agent.CurrentTransaction; transaction .AddCustomAttribute(\"Discount Code\", \"Summer Super Sale\") .AddCustomAttribute(\"Item Code\", 31456); Copy Node.js Custom attribute collection is enabled by default in Node.js. To collect custom attributes, call the relevant API method: For each attribute you want to record, call newrelic.addCustomAttribute. To record multiple attributes using a single call, use newrelic.addCustomAttributes. For example, to record attributes for a coupon code and an item ID code, you could include this in the parent method: newrelic.addCustomAttributes({ \"Discount Code\": \"Summer Super Sale\", \"Item Code\": 31456 }); Copy PHP Custom attribute collection is enabled by default in PHP. To collect custom attributes, call the relevant API method for each method that you want to record an attribute; newrelic_add_custom_parameter for transaction events and spans newrelic_add_custom_span_parameter for only spans For example, to record a variable named $userId, include this code in the parent method: newrelic_add_custom_parameter ('userID', $userId) Copy Python Custom attribute collection is enabled by default in Python. To collect custom attributes, call add_custom_parameter for each method that you want to record an attribute. For example, to record a variable named user_id, include this code in the parent method: newrelic.agent.add_custom_parameter('user_id', user_id) Copy Ruby Custom attribute collection is enabled by default in Ruby. To collect custom attributes, call the relevant API methods: For Ruby agent version 3.12.0 or higher, use the add_custom_attributes method. For example, to record a variable named @user_id, include this code in the parent method: ::NewRelic::Agent.add_custom_attributes({ user_id: @user.id }) Copy For Ruby agent version 3.11.2 or lower, use the add_custom_parameters method. For example, to record a variable named @user_id, include this code in the parent method: ::NewRelic::Agent.add_custom_parameters({ user_id: @user.id }) Copy Browser monitoring: Record custom attributes The browser agent provides an API to specify extra details associated with a page view or browser interaction, either by forwarding attributes from APM to browser monitoring or by specifying custom attributes through JavaScript. Values forwarded from the APM agent are encoded and injected into browser attributes by our browser agent. Infrastructure monitoring: Record custom attributes Our Infrastructure monitoring lets you create custom attributes that are used to annotate the data from the infrastructure agent. You can use this metadata to build filter sets, group your results, and annotate your data. Mobile monitoring: Record custom attributes Mobile agents include API calls to record custom attributes: For an overview of mobile monitoring custom data, see Insert custom events and attributes Android method: setAttribute iOS method: setAttribute",

      "body": "This list is current. Last updated September 28, 2021. This is a list of the networks, IP addresses, domains, ports, and endpoints used by API clients or agents to communicate with New Relic. TLS is required for all domains. Your browser must be able to communicate with a number of domains for New Relic One to work properly. See User-facing domains for the list of domains to be allowed through your firewall. For information on our FedRAMP endpoints, see our FedRAMP endpoints documentation. TLS encryption To ensure data security for our customers and to be in compliance with FedRAMP and other standards for data encryption, Transport Layer Security (TLS) is required for all domains. Our preferred protocol for all domains is TLS 1.2. For more information, see New Relic's Explorers Hub post about TLS 1.2. In addition, TLS 1.2 is required for most domains, except: APM agent connections Browser agent connections Event API For future updates to required and supported protocol versions, follow the Security Notifications tag in New Relic's Explorers Hub. User-facing domains Update your allow list to ensure New Relic can communicate with a number of integral domains that are listed in this section. Blocking domains can cause issues with individual product features or prevent pages from loading altogether. This list doesn't cover domains that New Relic connects to that can be blocked without affecting your usage of the product. It also doesn't cover Nerdpacks or other features that communicate with external services that have additional domain requirements. If your organization uses a firewall that restricts outbound traffic, follow the specific procedures for the operating system and the firewall you use to add the following domains to the allow list. Domain Description *.newrelic.com New Relic One and supporting services *.nr-assets.net Static New Relic assets *.nr-ext.net New Relic One Nerdpacks and assets *.amazonaws.com New Relic One catalog assets behind AWS S3 *.cloudfront.net Static New Relic assets behind AWS CloudFront CDN secure.gravatar.com Support for Gravatar avatars fonts.googleapis.com Support for Google Fonts fonts.gstatic.com Support for Google Fonts www.google.com Support for reCAPTCHA www.gstatic.com Support for reCAPTCHA *.nr-data.net OpenTelemetry and Pixie APM agents To enhance network performance and data security, New Relic uses a CDN and DDoS prevention service with a large IP range. New Relic agents require your firewall to allow outgoing connections to the following networks and ports. To add the following IP connections to the allow list, follow the specific procedures for the operating system and the firewall you use. TLS is required for all domains. Use the IP connections for account data in the US or European Union region as appropriate: IP connections APM data Networks US region accounts: 162.247.240.0/22 EU region accounts: 185.221.84.0/22 Ports US region accounts: Default: TCP 443 (recommended) TCP 80 EU region accounts: Default: TCP 443 (recommended) TCP 80 Endpoints US region accounts: collector*.newrelic.com EU region accounts: collector*.eu01.nr-data.net:443 (recommended) Port 443 recommended Recommendation: Use port 443, a secured channel for encrypted HTTPS traffic. Some New Relic agents also offer port 80, an unsecured channel open to all HTTP traffic. While some agents can be configured to use both port 80 and port 443, we recommend that you choose the port 443 (default). If you have an existing configuration that uses port 80, you can update it to use port 443, the default New Relic connection. Agent downloads TLS is required for all domains. Service for download.newrelic.com is provided through Fastly and is subject to change without warning. For the most current list of public IP addresses for New Relic agent downloads, see api.fastly.com/public-ip-list. Infrastructure agents In order to report data to New Relic, our infrastructure monitoring needs outbound access to these domains, networks, and ports. TLS is required for all domains. Use the IP connections for account data in the US or European Union region as appropriate: IP connections Infrastructure data Domains infra-api.newrelic.com: Required to submit events, metrics, and inventory data. identity-api.newrelic.com: Required for entity registration (for example, a host entity). infrastructure-command-api.newrelic.com: Required to determine feature flags. Also used for gradual rollout of new capabilities. log-api.newrelic.com: Required to submit logs to a US datacenter. log-api.eu.newrelic.com: Required to submit logs to an EU datacenter. metric-api.newrelic.com: Required to submit dimensional metrics.

Browser domains In addition to the IP addresses for APM agents, applications monitored by our browser agents use outgoing connections to the following domains. TLS is required for all domains. Use the IP connections for account data in the US or European Union region as appropriate: For US region accounts: bam.nr-data.net js-agent.newrelic.com For EU region accounts: eu01.nr-data.net bam.eu01.nr-data.net For more information about CDN access for the js-agent.newrelic.com file to the domain bam.nr-data.net or to one of the New Relic beacons, see Security for browser monitoring. Mobile domains In addition to the IP addresses for APM agents, applications monitored by our mobile agents use outgoing connections to the following domains. TLS is required for all domains. Use the IP connections for account data in the US or European Union region as appropriate: For US region accounts: mobile-collector.newrelic.com mobile-crash.newrelic.com mobile-symbol-upload.newrelic.com For EU region accounts: mobile-collector.eu01.nr-data.net mobile-crash.eu01.nr-data.net mobile-symbol-upload.eu01.nr-data.net Synthetic monitor public locations To configure your firewall to allow synthetic monitors to access your monitored URL, use Synthetic public minion IPs. TLS is required for all domains. Synthetic monitor private locations Synthetic private minions report to a specific endpoint based on region. To allow the private minion to access the endpoint or the static IP addresses associated with the endpoint, follow the specific procedures for the operating system and the firewall you use. These IP addresses may change in the future. TLS is required for all domains. Use the IP connections for account data in the US or European Union region as appropriate: IP connections Synthetics private location data Endpoint For US region accounts: https://synthetics-horde.nr-data.net/ For EU region accounts: https://synthetics-horde.eu01.nr-data.net/ IP addresses For US region accounts: 13.248.153.51 76.223.21.185 For EU region accounts: 185.221.86.57 185.221.86.25 Alerts webhooks, api.newrelic.com, cloud integrations, and ticketing integrations Endpoints that use api.newrelic.com (such as our GraphQL API for NerdGraph) and our New Relic-generated webhooks for alert policies use an IP address from designated network blocks for the US or European Union region. TLS is required for all addresses in these blocks. Network blocks for US region accounts: 162.247.240.0/22 Network blocks for EU region accounts: 158.177.65.64/29 159.122.103.184/29 161.156.125.32/28 These network blocks also apply to third-party ticketing integrations and New Relic cloud integrations. Pixie integration The Pixie integration runs in your Kubernetes cluster and pulls a set of curated observability data from Pixie to send it to New Relic using the OpenTelemetry line protocol. The Pixie integration requires outbound network access to the following: work.withpixie.ai:443 otlp.nr-data.net:4317 (US region accounts) otlp.eu01.nr-data.net:4317 (EU region accounts) OpenTelemetry New Relic supports the native OpenTelemetry Protocol (OTLP) for exporting telemetry data. This allows you to use the vendor neutral components developed by the OpenTelemetry community to export your data to New Relic. To export OTLP data to New Relic, configure the OTLP exporter to add a header ( api-key ) whose value is your account license key. And, based on your region, configure the endpoint where the exporter sends data to New Relic.

      "body": "This list is current. Last updated September 28, 2021. This is a list of the networks, IP addresses, domains, ports, and endpoints used by API clients or agents to communicate with New Relic. TLS is required for all domains. Your browser must be able to communicate with a number of domains for New Relic One to work properly. See User-facing domains for the list of domains to be allowed through your firewall. For information on our FedRAMP endpoints, see our FedRAMP endpoints documentation. TLS encryption To ensure data security for our customers and to be in compliance with FedRAMP and other standards for data encryption, Transport Layer Security (TLS) is required for all domains. Our preferred protocol for all domains is TLS 1.2. For more information, see New Relic's Explorers Hub post about TLS 1.2. In addition, TLS 1.2 is required for most domains, except: APM agent connections Browser agent connections Event API For future updates to required and supported protocol versions, follow the Security Notifications tag in New Relic's Explorers Hub. User-facing domains Update your allow list to ensure New Relic can communicate with a number of integral domains that are listed in this section. Blocking domains can cause issues with individual product features or prevent pages from loading altogether. This list doesn't cover domains that New Relic connects to that can be blocked without affecting your usage of the product. It also doesn't cover Nerdpacks or other features that communicate with external services that have additional domain requirements. If your organization uses a firewall that restricts outbound traffic, follow the specific procedures for the operating system and the firewall you use to add the following domains to the allow list. Domain Description *.newrelic.com New Relic One and supporting services *.nr-assets.net Static New Relic assets *.nr-ext.net New Relic One Nerdpacks and assets *.amazonaws.com New Relic One catalog assets behind AWS S3 *.cloudfront.net Static New Relic assets behind AWS CloudFront CDN secure.gravatar.com Support for Gravatar avatars fonts.googleapis.com Support for Google Fonts fonts.gstatic.com Support for Google Fonts www.google.com Support for reCAPTCHA www.gstatic.com Support for reCAPTCHA *.nr-data.net OpenTelemetry and Pixie APM agents To enhance network performance and data security, New Relic uses a CDN and DDoS prevention service with a large IP range. New Relic agents require your firewall to allow outgoing connections to the following networks and ports. To add the following IP connections to the allow list, follow the specific procedures for the operating system and the firewall you use. TLS is required for all domains. Use the IP connections for account data in the US or European Union region as appropriate: IP connections APM data Networks US region accounts: 162.247.240.0/22 EU region accounts: 185.221.84.0/22 Ports US region accounts: Default: TCP 443 (recommended) TCP 80 EU region accounts: Default: TCP 443 (recommended) TCP 80 Endpoints US region accounts: collector*.newrelic.com EU region accounts: collector*.eu01.nr-data.net:443 (recommended) Port 443 recommended Recommendation: Use port 443, a secured channel for encrypted HTTPS traffic. Some New Relic agents also offer port 80, an unsecured channel open to all HTTP traffic. While some agents can be configured to use both port 80 and port 443, we recommend that you choose the port 443 (default). If you have an existing configuration that uses port 80, you can update it to use port 443, the default New Relic connection. Agent downloads TLS is required for all domains. Service for download.newrelic.com is provided through Fastly and is subject to change without warning. For the most current list of public IP addresses for New Relic agent downloads, see api.fastly.com/public-ip-list. Infrastructure agents In order to report data to New Relic, our infrastructure monitoring needs outbound access to these domains, networks, and ports. TLS is required for all domains. Use the IP connections for account data in the US or European Union region as appropriate: IP connections Infrastructure data Domains infra-api.newrelic.com: Required to submit events, metrics, and inventory data. identity-api.newrelic.com: Required for entity registration (for example, a host entity). infrastructure-command-api.newrelic.com: Required to determine feature flags. Also used for gradual rollout of new capabilities. log-api.newrelic.com: Required to submit logs to a US datacenter. log-api.eu.newrelic.com: Required to submit logs to an EU datacenter. metric-api.newrelic.com: Required to submit dimensional metrics. Networks For US region accounts: 162.247.240.0/22 For EU region accounts: 185.221.84.0/22 Port 443 Domains + Port For US region accounts: infra-api.newrelic.com:443 identity-api.newrelic.com:443 infrastructure-command-api.newrelic.com:443 log-api.newrelic.com:443 metric-api.newrelic.com:443 For EU region accounts: infra-api.eu.newrelic.com:443 identity-api.eu.newrelic.com:443 infrastructure-command-api.eu.newrelic.com:443 log-api.eu.newrelic.com:443 metric-api.eu.newrelic.com:443 Proxy If your system needs a proxy to connect to this domain, use the Infrastructure proxy setting. Browser domains In addition to the IP addresses for APM agents, applications monitored by our browser agents use outgoing connections to the following domains. TLS is required for all domains. Use the IP connections for account data in the US or European Union region as appropriate: For US region accounts: bam.nr-data.net js-agent.newrelic.com For EU region accounts: eu01.nr-data.net bam.eu01.nr-data.net For more information about CDN access for the js-agent.newrelic.com file to the domain bam.nr-data.net or to one of the New Relic beacons, see Security for browser monitoring. Mobile domains In addition to the IP addresses for APM agents, applications monitored by our mobile agents use outgoing connections to the following domains. TLS is required for all domains. Use the IP connections for account data in the US or European Union region as appropriate: For US region accounts: mobile-collector.newrelic.com mobile-crash.newrelic.com mobile-symbol-upload.newrelic.com For EU region accounts: mobile-collector.eu01.nr-data.net mobile-crash.eu01.nr-data.net mobile-symbol-upload.eu01.nr-data.net Synthetic monitor public locations To configure your firewall to allow synthetic monitors to access your monitored URL, use Synthetic public minion IPs. TLS is required for all domains. Synthetic monitor private locations Synthetic private minions report to a specific endpoint based on region. To allow the private minion to access the endpoint or the static IP addresses associated with the endpoint, follow the specific procedures for the operating system and the firewall you use. These IP addresses may change in the future. TLS is required for all domains. Use the IP connections for account data in the US or European Union region as appropriate: IP connections Synthetics private location data Endpoint For US region accounts: https://synthetics-horde.nr-data.net/ For EU region accounts: https://synthetics-horde.eu01.nr-data.net/ IP addresses For US region accounts: 13.248.153.51 76.223.21.185 For EU region accounts: 185.221.86.57 185.221.86.25 Alerts webhooks, api.newrelic.com, cloud integrations, and ticketing integrations Endpoints that use api.newrelic.com (such as our GraphQL API for NerdGraph) and our New Relic-generated webhooks for alert policies use an IP address from designated network blocks for the US or European Union region. TLS is required for all addresses in these blocks. Network blocks for US region accounts: 162.247.240.0/22 Network blocks for EU region accounts: 158.177.65.64/29 159.122.103.184/29 161.156.125.32/28 These network blocks also apply to third-party ticketing integrations and New Relic cloud integrations. Pixie integration The Pixie integration runs in your Kubernetes cluster and pulls a set of curated observability data from Pixie to send it to New Relic using the OpenTelemetry line protocol. The Pixie integration requires outbound network access to the following: work.withpixie.ai:443 otlp.nr-data.net:4317 (US region accounts) otlp.eu01.nr-data.net:4317 (EU region accounts) OpenTelemetry New Relic supports the native OpenTelemetry Protocol (OTLP) for exporting telemetry data. This allows you to use the vendor neutral components developed by the OpenTelemetry community to export your data to New Relic. To export OTLP data to New Relic, configure the OTLP exporter to add a header ( api-key ) whose value is your account license key. And, based on your region, configure the endpoint where the exporter sends data to New Relic. See the OpenTelemetry quick start for more information. otlp.nr-data.net:4317 (US region accounts) otlp.eu01.nr-data.net:4317 (EU region accounts) Network blocks for US region accounts: 162.247.240.0/22 Network blocks for EU region accounts: 185.221.84.0/22",

      "body": "This list is current. Last updated September 28, 2021. This is a list of the networks, IP addresses, domains, ports, and endpoints used by API clients or agents to communicate with New Relic. TLS is required for all domains. Your browser must be able to communicate with a number of domains for New Relic One to work properly. See User-facing domains for the list of domains to be allowed through your firewall. For information on our FedRAMP endpoints, see our FedRAMP endpoints documentation. TLS encryption To ensure data security for our customers and to be in compliance with FedRAMP and other standards for data encryption, Transport Layer Security (TLS) is required for all domains. Our preferred protocol for all domains is TLS 1.2. For more information, see New Relic's Explorers Hub post about TLS 1.2. In addition, TLS 1.2 is required for most domains, except: APM agent connections Browser agent connections Event API For future updates to required and supported protocol versions, follow the Security Notifications tag in New Relic's Explorers Hub. User-facing domains Update your allow list to ensure New Relic can communicate with a number of integral domains that are listed in this section. Blocking domains can cause issues with individual product features or prevent pages from loading altogether. This list doesn't cover domains that New Relic connects to that can be blocked without affecting your usage of the product. It also doesn't cover Nerdpacks or other features that communicate with external services that have additional domain requirements. If your organization uses a firewall that restricts outbound traffic, follow the specific procedures for the operating system and the firewall you use to add the following domains to the allow list. Domain Description *.newrelic.com New Relic One and supporting services *.nr-assets.net Static New Relic assets *.nr-ext.net New Relic One Nerdpacks and assets *.amazonaws.com New Relic One catalog assets behind AWS S3 *.cloudfront.net Static New Relic assets behind AWS CloudFront CDN secure.gravatar.com Support for Gravatar avatars fonts.googleapis.com Support for Google Fonts fonts.gstatic.com Support for Google Fonts www.google.com Support for reCAPTCHA www.gstatic.com Support for reCAPTCHA *.nr-data.net OpenTelemetry and Pixie APM agents To enhance network performance and data security, New Relic uses a CDN and DDoS prevention service with a large IP range. New Relic agents require your firewall to allow outgoing connections to the following networks and ports. To add the following IP connections to the allow list, follow the specific procedures for the operating system and the firewall you use. TLS is required for all domains. Use the IP connections for account data in the US or European Union region as appropriate: IP connections APM data Networks US region accounts: 162.247.240.0/22 EU region accounts: 185.221.84.0/22 Ports US region accounts: Default: TCP 443 (recommended) TCP 80 EU region accounts: Default: TCP 443 (recommended) TCP 80 Endpoints US region accounts: collector*.newrelic.com EU region accounts: collector*.eu01.nr-data.net:443 (recommended) Port 443 recommended Recommendation: Use port 443, a secured channel for encrypted HTTPS traffic. Some New Relic agents also offer port 80, an unsecured channel open to all HTTP traffic. While some agents can be configured to use both port 80 and port 443, we recommend that you choose the port 443 (default). If you have an existing configuration that uses port 80, you can update it to use port 443, the default New Relic connection. Agent downloads TLS is required for all domains. Service for download.newrelic.com is provided through Fastly and is subject to change without warning. For the most current list of public IP addresses for New Relic agent downloads, see api.fastly.com/public-ip-list. Infrastructure agents In order to report data to New Relic, our infrastructure monitoring needs outbound access to these domains, networks, and ports. TLS is required for all domains. Use the IP connections for account data in the US or European Union region as appropriate: IP connections Infrastructure data Domains infra-api.newrelic.com: Required to submit events, metrics, and inventory data. identity-api.newrelic.com: Required for entity registration (for example, a host entity). infrastructure-command-api.newrelic.com: Required to determine feature flags. Also used for gradual rollout of new capabilities. log-api.newrelic.com: Required to submit logs to a US datacenter. log-api.eu.newrelic.com: Required to submit logs to an EU datacenter. metric-api.newrelic.com: Required to submit dimensional metrics.

      "body": "This list is current. Last updated September 28, 2021. This is a list of the networks, IP addresses, domains, ports, and endpoints used by API clients or agents to communicate with New Relic. TLS is required for all domains. Your browser must be able to communicate with a number of domains for New Relic One to work properly. See User-facing domains for the list of domains to be allowed through your firewall. For information on our FedRAMP endpoints, see our FedRAMP endpoints documentation. TLS encryption To ensure data security for our customers and to be in compliance with FedRAMP and other standards for data encryption, Transport Layer Security (TLS) is required for all domains. Our preferred protocol for all domains is TLS 1.2. For more information, see New Relic's Explorers Hub post about TLS 1.2. In addition, TLS 1.2 is required for most domains, except: APM agent connections Browser agent connections Event API For future updates to required and supported protocol versions, follow the Security Notifications tag in New Relic's Explorers Hub. User-facing domains Update your allow list to ensure New Relic can communicate with a number of integral domains that are listed in this section. Blocking domains can cause issues with individual product features or prevent pages from loading altogether. This list doesn't cover domains that New Relic connects to that can be blocked without affecting your usage of the product. It also doesn't cover Nerdpacks or other features that communicate with external services that have additional domain requirements. If your organization uses a firewall that restricts outbound traffic, follow the specific procedures for the operating system and the firewall you use to add the following domains to the allow list. Domain Description *.newrelic.com New Relic One and supporting services *.nr-assets.net Static New Relic assets *.nr-ext.net New Relic One Nerdpacks and assets *.amazonaws.com New Relic One catalog assets behind AWS S3 *.cloudfront.net Static New Relic assets behind AWS CloudFront CDN secure.gravatar.com Support for Gravatar avatars fonts.googleapis.com Support for Google Fonts fonts.gstatic.com Support for Google Fonts www.google.com Support for reCAPTCHA www.gstatic.com Support for reCAPTCHA *.nr-data.net OpenTelemetry and Pixie APM agents To enhance network performance and data security, New Relic uses a CDN and DDoS prevention service with a large IP range. New Relic agents require your firewall to allow outgoing connections to the following networks and ports. To add the following IP connections to the allow list, follow the specific procedures for the operating system and the firewall you use. TLS is required for all domains. Use the IP connections for account data in the US or European Union region as appropriate: IP connections APM data Networks US region accounts: 162.247.240.0/22 EU region accounts: 185.221.84.0/22 Ports US region accounts: Default: TCP 443 (recommended) TCP 80 EU region accounts: Default: TCP 443 (recommended) TCP 80 Endpoints US region accounts: collector*.newrelic.com EU region accounts: collector*.eu01.nr-data.net:443 (recommended) Port 443 recommended Recommendation: Use port 443, a secured channel for encrypted HTTPS traffic. Some New Relic agents also offer port 80, an unsecured channel open to all HTTP traffic. While some agents can be configured to use both port 80 and port 443, we recommend that you choose the port 443 (default). If you have an existing configuration that uses port 80, you can update it to use port 443, the default New Relic connection. Agent downloads TLS is required for all domains. Service for download.newrelic.com is provided through Fastly and is subject to change without warning. For the most current list of public IP addresses for New Relic agent downloads, see api.fastly.com/public-ip-list. Infrastructure agents In order to report data to New Relic, our infrastructure monitoring needs outbound access to these domains, networks, and ports. TLS is required for all domains. Use the IP connections for account data in the US or European Union region as appropriate: IP connections Infrastructure data Domains infra-api.newrelic.com: Required to submit events, metrics, and inventory data. identity-api.newrelic.com: Required for entity registration (for example, a host entity). infrastructure-command-api.newrelic.com: Required to determine feature flags. Also used for gradual rollout of new capabilities. log-api.newrelic.com: Required to submit logs to a US datacenter. log-api.eu.newrelic.com: Required to submit logs to an EU datacenter. metric-api.newrelic.com: Required to submit dimensional metrics. Networks For US region accounts: 162.247.240.0/22 For EU region accounts: 185.221.84.0/22 Port 443 Domains + Port For US region accounts: infra-api.newrelic.com:443 identity-api.newrelic.com:443 infrastructure-command-api.newrelic.com:443 log-api.newrelic.com:443 metric-api.newrelic.com:443 For EU region accounts: infra-api.eu.newrelic.com:443 identity-api.eu.newrelic.com:443 infrastructure-command-api.eu.newrelic.com:443 log-api.eu.newrelic.com:443 metric-api.eu.newrelic.com:443 Proxy If your system needs a proxy to connect to this domain, use the Infrastructure proxy setting. Browser domains In addition to the IP addresses for APM agents, applications monitored by our browser agents use outgoing connections to the following domains. TLS is required for all domains. Use the IP connections for account data in the US or European Union region as appropriate: For US region accounts: bam.nr-data.net js-agent.newrelic.com For EU region accounts: eu01.nr-data.net bam.eu01.nr-data.net For more information about CDN access for the js-agent.newrelic.com file to the domain bam.nr-data.net or to one of the New Relic beacons, see Security for browser monitoring. Mobile domains In addition to the IP addresses for APM agents, applications monitored by our mobile agents use outgoing connections to the following domains. TLS is required for all domains. Use the IP connections for account data in the US or European Union region as appropriate: For US region accounts: mobile-collector.newrelic.com mobile-crash.newrelic.com mobile-symbol-upload.newrelic.com For EU region accounts: mobile-collector.eu01.nr-data.net mobile-crash.eu01.nr-data.net mobile-symbol-upload.eu01.nr-data.net Synthetic monitor public locations To configure your firewall to allow synthetic monitors to access your monitored URL, use Synthetic public minion IPs. TLS is required for all domains. Synthetic monitor private locations Synthetic private minions report to a specific endpoint based on region. To allow the private minion to access the endpoint or the static IP addresses associated with the endpoint, follow the specific procedures for the operating system and the firewall you use. These IP addresses may change in the future. TLS is required for all domains. Use the IP connections for account data in the US or European Union region as appropriate: IP connections Synthetics private location data Endpoint For US region accounts: https://synthetics-horde.nr-data.net/ For EU region accounts: https://synthetics-horde.eu01.nr-data.net/ IP addresses For US region accounts: 13.248.153.51 76.223.21.185 For EU region accounts: 185.221.86.57 185.221.86.25 Alerts webhooks, api.newrelic.com, cloud integrations, and ticketing integrations Endpoints that use api.newrelic.com (such as our GraphQL API for NerdGraph) and our New Relic-generated webhooks for alert policies use an IP address from designated network blocks for the US or European Union region. TLS is required for all addresses in these blocks. Network blocks for US region accounts: 162.247.240.0/22 Network blocks for EU region accounts: 158.177.65.64/29 159.122.103.184/29 161.156.125.32/28 These network blocks also apply to third-party ticketing integrations and New Relic cloud integrations. Pixie integration The Pixie integration runs in your Kubernetes cluster and pulls a set of curated observability data from Pixie to send it to New Relic using the OpenTelemetry line protocol. The Pixie integration requires outbound network access to the following: work.withpixie.ai:443 otlp.nr-data.net:4317 (US region accounts) otlp.eu01.nr-data.net:4317 (EU region accounts) OpenTelemetry New Relic supports the native OpenTelemetry Protocol (OTLP) for exporting telemetry data. This allows you to use the vendor neutral components developed by the OpenTelemetry community to export your data to New Relic. To export OTLP data to New Relic, configure the OTLP exporter to add a header ( api-key ) whose value is your account license key. And, based on your region, configure the endpoint where the exporter sends data to New Relic. See the OpenTelemetry quick start for more information. otlp.nr-data.net:4317 (US region accounts) otlp.eu01.nr-data.net:4317 (EU region accounts) Network blocks for US region accounts: 162.247.240.0/22 Network blocks for EU region accounts: 185.221.84.0/22",

      "body": "Application performance monitoring (APM) is exactly what it sounds like: monitoring of your web or non-web application's performance. APM supports apps for several programming languages, including Go, Java, .NET, Node.js, PHP, Python, and Ruby, as well as a C SDK. View the status of all your services at a glance with APM. Tip This doc gives you detailed information about why APM matters to your business. But if you want to skip ahead, just sign up for a New Relic account. (It's free, forever!) Then, after you install the agent, you can start working with your data. Ready to get started? Start benefiting from APM in five simple steps (and just a few minutes!). Sign up for a New Relic account (it's free, forever!). Install and customize the language agent for your app. Generate some traffic for your app. Wait a few minutes for New Relic to start receiving your data. Log in to your account, and start exploring New Relic! Use the Explorer in New Relic One to access and observe the full stack of your software, including your apps, see performance data and alerting status at a glance, and check relationships. We provide you with a simple, yet powerful visual tool to monitor all your entities, that is, anything we can identify that reports data. In the New Relic ecosystem, entities include basic components like applications, hosts, containers, or database services, but it can also refer to custom groupings of such elements. You can also create your own entities. If data does not appear after waiting a few minutes, follow the troubleshooting tips for your APM agent. Identify problems before your users do Our APM agents report and store the state of your application so you can quickly identify potential problems before they affect your end users. With APM, your DevOps teams don't need to guess whether a performance blocker comes from the app itself, CPU availability, database loads, or something entirely unexpected. Use our APM solutions to gather both current and historical information about memory usage, CPU utilization, database query performance, web browser rendering performance, app availability, error analysis, external services, and other useful metrics. Monitor all aspects of your business Take advantage of these APM features, and more: Features Description App performance at a glance When you sign in to APM and select an app for your account, use the Summary page to quickly examine relationships across different aspects of your environment; for example: Web transactions response time: Where is the most time being spent? In the request queue, during different stages of page rendering and execution, from external services, or something else? Transaction traces: Which transactions are the slowest, and why? Error rate and throughput: What relationship is there between a spike in errors or slower throughput for a particular time period? Was there a deployment or outage at that time? Hosts: What kind of impact does this have on CPU usage, memory, etc.? Apdex: How are these events affecting customers' satisfaction with the site? Web and non-web transactions Start by comparing the top twenty web transactions or non-web transactions in terms of most time consuming, slowest average response time, highest throughput, or worst Apdex. From there, drill down into deeper trace levels for individual transactions, which in turn break down into smaller segments and components, from HTTPS requests on down to SQL queries. Want to explore even deeper? Set up distributed tracing to see how requests move across a distributed system. Select the transactions that are most important to your business (key transactions). APM and Infrastructure When your APM and Infrastructure accounts are linked, you will have access to APM data charts on these Infrastructure UI pages: Hosts, Network, Storage, and Processes. Distributed tracing Distributed tracing gives you visibility across distributed systems, showing you the path of a request as it travels between services. This feature is especially valuable for large, distributed systems that rely on many small services and microservices. Logs Bring your logs and application's data together to make troubleshooting easier and faster. With logs in context, you can see log messages related to your errors and traces directly in your app's UI. You can also see logs in context of your infrastructure data, such as Kubernetes clusters. No need to switch to another UI page in New Relic One. Service maps APM's service maps show your app's connections and dependencies, including databases and external services. Health indicators and performance metrics show you the current operational status for every part of your architecture. You can create and customize service maps to visualize and monitor your complex architectures. Query your data You can query and visualize your data: Sample and search APM transaction and error data to gain full understanding of the data being collected. Browse your data visually with the data explorer. Create custom SQL-like queries of your data using the New Relic Query Language (NRQL), or using our PromQL-style queries. Use dashboards to build advanced data visualizations, contextualize data, and understand what's going on in your system, real-time. These are just a few of APM's features.

Extend agent instrumentation Other helpful tools include: Tools Description Browser monitoring Integrate the Python agent with browser monitoring to gain visibility into end-user browser activity. Simple scripts and background tasks Monitor job-based or task queuing systems, like Celery, or other standalone non-web functions. Business data analysis with data exploration. Use the Python agent with our data explorer to organize, query, and visualize your data to answer key questions about application performance and customer experience. Use default transaction attributes, or add your own. Query your data using the New Relic Query Language (NRQL). Send your own event data. Create and share customizable, interactive dashboards. Install the Python agent Before you install the Python agent, make sure your system meets the system requirements. You must also create a New Relic account. We support a number of web frameworks and libraries right out of the box, including Django, WSGI, and Gunicorn. If you use one of the supported web frameworks, installation is easy. If you use an unsupported framework, the process will involve some additions to your app code and/or web server files. For a quick and simple install process that will work for the majority of setups, follow these simple steps: Download and install the Python package. Create config file. Integrate the Python agent with your application. Read the Quick Start guide Add Python data Monitor non-web scripts, background tasks, and functions The Python agent also lets you monitor non-web scripts, worker processes, tasks, and functions. The installation process for these non-web transactions is similar to the one used for a web app, with one major difference: instead of going through the standard integration process described in the install instructions, you would manually \"wrap\" any function you want to monitor. For more information, see Non-web tasks and processes. For instructions on monitoring Celery tasks, see Celery background tasks. What's next after installation? Once you get the agent up and running, some suggested next steps are: Explore your data in and get comfortable with the user interface. Read our docs on our other observability solutions and the APM page. Change your application's name, or other configuration options. Learn about setting up custom instrumentation for application activity not monitored by default. Consider the Python Telemetry SDK. Troubleshooting After you complete the install process, your data should appear in the APM UI within five minutes. If it does not, use these troubleshooting resources: If no data appears, follow these troubleshooting steps. If you experience issues when installing or running the Python agent on a new host, test that the package is installed correctly and that it can contact New Relic's data collector service. For other problems, see the full list of troubleshooting documentation. Check the source code The Python agent is open source software. That means you can browse its source code and send improvements, or create your own fork and build it. For more information, see the README.",

      "body": "New Relic requires HTTPS for all traffic to APM and the New Relic REST API. The Ruby agent connects to New Relic collector servers over SSL by default, and uses a system/host installed set of SSL certificate to validate the identity of the collector servers when connecting. In most cases, this default set of certificates is sufficient. In certain configurations, you may need to use a custom CA bundle. For example, you may use an HTTP proxy to intercept and decrypt SSL traffic from the agent, which then establishes a separate SSL connection to New Relic. Custom CA bundles are available in versions 3.9.4 or higher of the Ruby agent. Use a custom CA bundle To configure the agent to use a custom CA bundle when validating the SSL certificate presented by a proxy, set the ca_bundle_path configuration setting in your newrelic.yml file or via the NEW_RELIC_CA_BUNDLE_PATH environment variable: common: &default_settings ca_bundle_path: certificates/mycert.pem # ... other settings ... Copy Specify a path to a .pem file containing each certificate you want the agent to use when validating the identity of the proxy or server. You can concatenate multiple certificates into a single .pem file. Relative path: If you specify a relative path, the agent will assign a path relative to the working directory of your app server process at runtime. Absolute path: If your working directory is / rather than the root of your application, be sure to specify an absolute path. Installing SSL Certificates If you're deploying a Ruby application and agent to a container or server that does not have CA certificates installed, you need to ensure they're now installed for 7.0 or highter releases of the agent to make successful HTTPS connections to New Relic servers. These CA certificates may be installed in various ways, depending on your host.

In some cases, when MGIs with a significant high number of metrics are detected, a rule is created automatically to protect the platform from performance degradation. Metric normalization rules management You can create and manage new rules that deal with the noise produced from high cardinality metrics by using the metric normalization tool, which is accessible from each service dashboard in the New Relic Explorer. Once there, select Metric Normalization in the left sidebar. There you can see the existing rules or create new ones. Click a rule to modify it, or click Create a new rule to create a new one.

Matches: here you will see a preview of the metrics matched by the regular expression above. Action: the action you want to perform on the metrics. Replace: replace the matched metrics by the regular expression with the value described in the Replacement field. Ignore: ignore any metric that matches the regular expression. Deny new metrics: only write metrics that have already been reported, and ignore those that match the regular expression. Replacement: only active when Replace is enabled. Matched metrics are replaced with the field's value. If the regular expression is capturing groups, you can use placeholders for them with \\1 or \\2 for the groups 1 and 2 respectively. Active: rules can’t be deleted, but can be deactivated. Click the toggle to enable or disable the rule. If you want the rule to be removed, reach out to New Relic's support. Terminate: When enabled, the rules waterfall is exited when the associated pattern is matched. Notes: internal notes on the rule. Has no effect on the rule.

      "body": "In the software industry, a tag typically refers to a piece of metadata added to a data set for the purpose of improving data organization and findability. At New Relic, our tags are key:value pairs (like team: operations) added to various sets of data, like monitored apps and hosts, agents, dashboards, and workloads. We make some important attributes available as tags (for example, app metadata like app name and language, and host metadata like host name and AWS region). You can also add your own custom tags. You can use tags in the UI to filter down to relevant data. Here is an example: Here you can see an accountId tag being used to filter workloads to a specific account. Tags help you to: Organize data coming from a large number of sources and/or to a large number of New Relic accounts. Identify teams, roles, environments, or regions to know who’s responsible for what (see example use cases). Better organize and search dashboards and workloads. Query and chart APM data. Tags are useful for organizing data at a high level. If you want to add more fine-grained detail, like capturing user names or other high-cardinality values, custom attributes or custom events are a better solution. Tip Tags were previously called labels in the New Relic UI. You may sometimes see labelin our code; for example, some of our APM agent config files use a label config option for tags. Tag format and limits Format requirements and limits for tags: The UI has limits on the total number of tags it can display per entity: Limit of 100 for tags reported by default or added via agent/integration configuration. Limit of 100 for custom tags added via UI or API. The following are maximum character length for tags: Key: 128 characters Value: 256 characters When using our API to add tags, a dash (-) in a tag key is interpreted as a minus symbol. If your tag key has a dash, use back ticks around it (like `key-name`). Best practices and tips Before adding tags, we recommend first seeing how our default tags work for you. When you're ready to add your own tags, review the following best practices tips to get the most out of them. Tips on keeping tags simple: Start by adding only tags you know you’ll definitely use. Unused tags create noise and may add confusion. Try to use short tags. Shorter tags are easier to parse, and also the UI may sometimes truncate longer tags. (See character limits.) When possible, use keys and values that are human-readable (for example, region: EMEA is better than Param8323 : 1229072). Avoid including several values like regions: EMEA | US | LATAM in a single tag. We recommend using three different tags for that, like region: emea, region: us, and region: latam. If you want to match multiple tags, you can do that using the advanced options in the filter UI. Tips on using tags consistently: Try to be consistent with tag language across your teams and entities. Be consistent with naming. For example, avoid using both region: emea and reg: emea. Be consistent with format. For example, avoid using both camelCase and kebab-case. Although tag searching is not case-sensitive in the UI and API, try to be consistent with capitalization. For example, avoid using both env: staging and env: Staging. Tips on cross-team implementation: Tags help improve observability and cost allocation. For this reason, responsibility for tag implementation is often assigned to an observability team, SREs, a group of architects, or a cross-team task force. We recommend the people responsible for implementing tags meet and create an internal policy to describe how the tags are defined and which conventions are to be used. Then: Keep this reference manual up to date. Automate the definition of tags when you deploy New Relic agents, at the cloud provider, or through New Relic automation tools, such as the API or Terraform. Create recurring reports that identify entities that are non-compliant with your tagging standards. Tag examples Here are some examples of common ways to use tags to organize data: Team-related tags Creating tags for team names can be helpful to understand which team, group, department, or region was responsible for a change that led to a performance issue. Team examples: team: backend team: frontend team: db Role examples: roles: architecture roles: devops roles: pm Region examples: region: emea region: america region: asia Environment-related tags You can create entities for the environment they belong to. Examples: env: production env: qa env: development env: staging Criticality-related tags You can create tags related to criticality levels, which lets you easier track the most critical issues. Examples: layer: level1 layer: level2 layer: level3 How tags are added Some important attributes, by default, are available for use as tags. For example, the account name, the account ID, and some basic host/server metadata are available as default tags. You can't remove these available-by-default tags. Here are some details about how tags are added for some specific data sources: Add tags via UI or API When you add tags via the UI or API, this occurs at the entity level. This means that, for example, if you have multiple APM agents monitoring a single entity and apply a tag via the UI, that tag is available for all data coming from that entity. To add or delete tags via the UI: Select a monitored entity, like a monitored app or host. Near the entity’s name at the top of the page, select the See metadata and manage tags menu. In the menu that pops up, add or delete a tag. For APM agents, restart your service. To manage tags via API: see our NerdGraph tagging docs. For a guide to using our CLI to automate tagging, see our developer site. APM agent tags You can add tags via the UI and API or you can add tags using APM agent configuration, both methods require you to restart your service. There are differences in how these apply tags: Via agent config: These tags are applied at the agent-level, not the entity/application level. This would be a good option if you have multiple agents monitoring different aspects of the same app (for example, a blue-green deployment model). Via the UI or API: These tags are applied at the entity/application level. Here are links to the agent configuration options: C SDK: not available Java Go .NET Node.js PHP Python Ruby For information on querying APM tags, see Query APM tags. And check out this short video on querying APM tags (3:20 minutes). Infrastructure data tags There are several ways tags are added to infrastructure entities and services: Use the UI or API to add tags at the entity level. Infrastructure agent: some attributes are available by default as tags. You can also add custom attributes, which are also available as tags in the UI. On-host integrations: some attributes are available by default as tags. You can also add tags by using integration-specific labels config options (for an example, see the labels config for the Apache integration). Cloud service integrations: by default we report tags and labels that are defined in the cloud service. To add tags, you'd add them on the cloud-service-side. Automate tags with our CLI For a guide to automating tags using our CLI tool, see our developer site. Use tags to filter the UI Use the filter field at the top of the New Relic Explorer to filter down to the entities you care about. You can use multiple filter conditions. To filter down to certain entities using tags: From one.newrelic.com, click Explorer. Click the Filter by... field to see a dropdown of available attributes and tags. You can filter by multiple elements and use advanced search options. To find an entity’s metadata and tags from the UI, here are two options: From a list of entities in the UI, at the far right, select an entity's icon. OR Select an entity. Near the top of the page, select the icon. To use the API to view tags, see our NerdGraph docs. Learn about how to use tags with dashboards and how to use tags with workloads. Custom queries, charts, and alerts Different features handle tags differently. Here are some details about how you can use NRQL to query tag data, or create NRQL condition alerts. Query and alert on APM tags You can query APM tags using NRQL. Minimum agent versions: C: not available Go: 2.3.0 Java: 4.9.0 .NET: 8.17 Node: v4.13.0 PHP: not available Python: v4.10.0.112 Ruby: 6.1.0.352 Here are some query examples: Throughput across shards Given a service that is distributed across nine shards, each shard assigned as an environment, we can plot the transaction throughput on all shards using a wildcard query like: SELECT rate(count(apm.service.transaction.duration), 1 minute) FROM Metric WHERE appName LIKE 'MyApp (%' AND transactionType = 'Other' FACET tags.Environment TIMESERIES Copy Transactions per team To see the number of transactions per service for a specific team, we might use a query like: FROM Transaction SELECT count(*) WHERE tags.Team = 'team-a' FACET tags.Project TIMESERIES Copy Alert on error rate for teams You can use a query for your services’ error rate for setting an alert without having to create a rule for each service. Here is the error rate for all services on a team called team-b. And this alert will automatically monitor any new app names added with the team tag. FROM Metric SELECT count(apm.service.error.count) / count(apm.service.transaction.duration) WHERE tags.Team = 'team-b' FACET appName Copy Related to this, you might create a general rule for a specific service deployed across several environments, so that we have an alarm for a single service monitoring each environment individually: From Metric SELECT count(apm.service.error.count) / count(apm.service.transaction.duration) WHERE tags.Project = 'MyProject' FACET tags.Environment Copy Query and alert on attributes As explained in the tag sources information, some important attributes are used as tags. You can query all attributes and create custom charts using NRQL, and create NRQL alert conditions.",

      "body": "New Relic provides integrations and quickstarts for many popular services and frameworks. If you have New Relic and want to report data from a service we don't have an integration for, there are several ways New Relic lets you create your own integration: With New Relic infrastructure monitoring, you can use our lightweight Flex tool (recommended, documented below) or, to build a complete on-host integration, see our Integrations SDK. Telemetry (metrics, traces) monitoring solutions: Use our Telemetry SDKs. Build a custom New Relic One application that uses your own JavaScript UI functionality. What is Flex? New Relic Flex is an application-agnostic, all-in-one tool that allows you to collect metric data from a wide variety of services. It comes bundled with our infrastructure agent. You can instrument any app that exposes metrics over a standard protocol (HTTP, file, shell) in a standard format (for example, JSON or plain text): you create a YAML config file, start the Infrastructure agent, and your data is reported to New Relic. Flex can send event and metric data to New Relic from a wide range of sources. Using a simple YAML config file, you can run HTTP/HTTPS requests, run shell commands, and parse file content. You can also use standard regex expressions to customize and control the data gathered from those inputs. See an example config. After collecting and cleaning up the data, you can then query Flex data in New Relic, create custom charts for it, and use that data in your dashboards. Requirements Flex comes bundled with our infrastructure agent. To use Flex, you need: Infrastructure agent version 1.10.7 or higher (update | check version) running on Linux, Windows, or Kubernetes. How does Flex work? Flex uses our infrastructure agent to execute commands that generate the data you want to report. Here's a brief overview of how Flex works to report data: You define the data you want to report in a YAML configuration file, located in the infrastructure agent package. See an example configuration: Example config The following is an example of a Flex configuration for monitoring the uptime of a Linux server. This configuration is placed in a file named flex-uptime.yml. This would be placed in the infrastructure agent's integration configuration section, located at /etc/newrelic-infra/integrations.d/flex-uptime.yml. integrations: - name: nri-flex config: name: linuxUptimeIntegration apis: - name: Uptime commands: - run: 'cat /proc/uptime' split: horizontal split_by: \\s+ set_header: [uptimeSeconds,idletimeSeconds] Copy Some notes on what this configuration does: run defines the command to execute. The name indicated by name: Uptime is appended with Sample to generate an event called UptimeSample. The name should not start with the ESX or PCF prefix. The split_by: \\s+ splits the fields based on the space character. The command generates attributes attached to the UptimeSample event. The attributes are named uptimeSeconds and idletimeSeconds. The infrastructure agent runs Flex at a frequency based on its own configuration (default: every 30 seconds) and sends the data to New Relic. You can then query your data, create custom charts with it, and add it to dashboards. Learn more The Flex integration comes bundled with the infrastructure agent. Learn more about requirements.

This is located in the top right of most New Relic UI pages. For more on factors that affect access to accounts, see Factors affecting access. To find account settings, use the account dropdown. administrator A type of user role on a New Relic account. For more information, see Users. agent At New Relic, an agent is a piece of monitoring software that provides integrations with various technologies (for example, web frameworks, host operating systems, or database types). The agents send that data to New Relic, usually on a specific cadence. For more information, see: New Relic Instant Observability Install agents agent API Some New Relic agents have agent APIs that allow you to extend the functionality of an agent. You can use the API to control, customize and extend the functionality of the agent. Here are some agent API docs: APM agents: C SDK API Go agent API Java agent API .NET agent API Node.js agent API PHP agent API Ruby agent API Python agent API Browser agent: Browser agent API Mobile agents: iOS SDK API Android SDK API aggregated metrics Aggregated metric data summarizes calls to specific methods in your application, including how many times each one was called and response times. In the New Relic UI, you see the class and method names along with their aggregate numbers. Metric data aggregation depends on the New Relic tool and your subscription level. For more information, see the documentation about data retention. aggregation delay The length of time in seconds to wait for the aggregation window to fill with data. Required when using CADENCE or EVENT_FLOW aggreation_method types. aggregation function You can use NRQL query functions, such as sum(), average(), or latest() to choose how the data points in an aggregation window should be processed into a single data point. The single aggregated data point is what's passed through the alert evaluation process. aggregation method New Relic aggregates data into windows, and needs to determine when the current window ends and the next one begins. The aggregation_method is the logic that tells us when we have all the data for a given aggregation window. Once the window is closed, the data is aggregated into a single point and evaluated against the threshold. This field is optional. One of the following three values can be specified: EVENT_FLOW: (Default) Each aggregation window will wait until it starts to see timestamps arrive that are past its own delay setting. Once this occurs, the data is published. Relies on the timestamps of arriving data, so wall-clock time is no longer relevant. Works best for sources that come in frequently and with low event spread (high througput metrics) CADENCE: Classic New Relic logic where each evaluation window waits exactly as long as the aggregation_delay setting, using the wall-clock time as a timer. aggregation_delay is required when using this option. Data arriving too late will be dropped, which can cause false alerts. EVENT_TIMER: Each aggregation window has a timer on it, set to the aggregation_timer setting. The Timer starts running as soon as the first data point appears for that aggregation window (based on the data point’s timestamp). The aggregation_timer is reset for each new data point that arrives for that window. Once the aggregation_timer reaches 0, the aggregation window is published. Ideal for sparse and batched data, such as cloud integrations and infrequent error logs. aggregation timer The length of time in seconds to wait after each data point received, to ensure the entire batch is processed. Required when using EVENT_TIMER aggregation_method type. aggregation window Streaming alerts gathers data together into specific amounts of time. These windows of time are customizable. Data points are collected together based their timestamps and reported as a batch. The customizable aggregation window provides greater flexibility and fewer false violations when alerting on irregular or less frequent data points. alert An alert communicates an event or incident that designated personnel can track through Alerts. For an explanation of how basic alerts concepts are related, see Concepts and workflow. alert condition An alert condition (or condition), identified by its unique numeric condition_id, contains the criteria for creating a violation. The condition includes the threshold that is set for a metric timeslice or a custom metric over time on a chosen target. For an explanation of how a condition relates to other basic alerts concepts, see Concepts and workflow. alert evaluation Streaming data is assessed on a set of aggregation windows to determine if an alert condition is violating or recovering. The aggregation window time is how long we'll collect data before running the NRQL query condition. The offset evaluation time is how long you want us to wait for late data before assessing it. If a window doesn't have any data points, it's treated as a gap for loss of signal. alert policy A collection of one or more conditions, one or more notification channels, and an Incident preference setting. If a condition contained within the policy opens a violation, an incident may be opened depending on the Incident preference setting. Notifications will then be sent to all channels attached to the policy. For an explanation of how a policy relates to other basic alerts concepts, see Concepts and workflow. apdex Apdex is an industry-standard way to measure users' satisfaction with the response time of an application or service. New Relic rates each response as Satisfied, Tolerated, or Frustrated, and uses these ratings to calculate an overall user satisfaction score. For more information, see Apdex: Measure user satisfaction. apdex_f The response time above which a transaction are rated frustrating. Defaults to four times apdex_t. Requests that complete in less than apdex_t are rated satisfied. Requests that take longer than apdex_t, but less than four times apdex_t (apdex_f), are tolerated. Any requests that take longer than apdex_f are rated frustrating. For more information, see Apdex: Measure user satisfaction. apdex_t The response time above which a transaction is considered tolerable. The default value is 0.5 seconds, but you can change this in your Apdex settings. Requests that complete in less than apdex_t are rated satisfied. Requests that take more than apdex_t, but less than apdex_f, are tolerated. Any requests that take longer than apdex_f are rated frustrating. For more information, see Apdex: Measure user satisfaction. API (application programming interface) New Relic offers a variety of APIs and SDKs. For more information, see the introduction to New Relic's APIs. APM New Relic's APM (application performance monitoring) provides monitoring of your web or non-web application's performance. APM supports apps using several programming languages. application For New Relic purposes, any program instrumented by New Relic. application ID Some New Relic solutions assign a monitored application a unique application ID, often shortened to app ID. When present, this ID is available in the UI. It is also reported as an attribute and can be queried. For how to determine this, see Find app ID. application name The name that New Relic combines with your license key to uniquely identify a particular app. For more information, see Name your application. Applied Intelligence (AI) Applied Intelligence (AI) helps you find, troubleshoot, and resolve problems more quickly. Specifically, it’s a hybrid machine learning engine that reduces alert noise, correlates incidents, and automatically detects anomalies. Applied Intelligence includes Alerts, Incident Intelligence, and Proactive Detection. attribute Attributes are key-value pairs attached to data objects reported to New Relic. Attributes add detail, and they're similar to tags or labels in other SaaS software. You can explore this data by querying or searching via the UI or by using the data dictionary. Examples: APM reports a Transaction event. This includes timing data for the transaction in a duration attribute, which might have a value of .002. Our Infrastructure Monitoring reports a ProcessSample event. This includes a variety of CPU usage attributes, including a cpuSystemPercent attribute, which might have a value of .01. Our Telemetry SDK reports a Metric data type for storing metrics, with attached attributes like metricName and newrelic.source. Some New Relic tools allow you to report custom attributes to enhance your monitoring. For more information about attributes in APM, see Agent attributes. availability monitoring See Types of Synthetics monitors. browser The New Relic UI supports most browsers. For more information, see Supported browsers. For our end-user browser monitoring tool, see Browser Monitoring. Browser monitoring A Real User Monitoring (RUM) solution that measures the speed and performance of your end users as they navigate to your site from different web browsers, devices, operating systems, and networks. background external See web external. child account See parent account. cloud-based integration New Relic offers cloud-based integrations with providers such as Amazon Web Services (AWS), Microsoft Azure, and Google Cloud Platform. collector The component that collects data from New Relic agents running on an app server, mobile device, or end-user browser. While the agent is installed on a user's app server, the collectors are centrally located in New Relic's data center. In order to contact the collector, the agent must be able to reach New Relic's domains and IP addresses. (The exact domain or IP depends on the New Relic monitoring tool.) The collector receives and interprets this data, and stores it in a database. The data is then retrieved and presented in the New Relic UI and by our various REST APIs. Command line interface (CLI) Our command line interface (CLI) is a tool you can use to build a New Relic application. This is the same tool our own engineers use. Go here for quick start instructions. Go to our Developer site for sample apps and guides. compute unit (CU) A unit of measurement that determines your pricing for some New Relic products governed by our original product-based pricing model. For more information, see Compute unit pricing. condition_id See alert condition. CPM (calls per minute) The number of calls your application receives each minute. This usually corresponds to the number of page views or external connections, and is usually the same as RPM (requests per minute). CPU burn The time consumed by code minus the wait time for a transaction. This is the time actually spent processing the transaction. It appears in the New Relic UI at the top of the transaction view for the agents that provide it (Ruby and PHP only). custom attribute A key-value pair added to a transaction or event in order to gain additional information about it. For more information, see custom attributes. custom dashboard A customizable dashboard with charts and tables that includes data from multiple New Relic data sources. For more information, see dashboards. custom event An event, in New Relic terms, is a data object with attached attributes. New Relic reports default event types, like Transaction and TransactionError. You can also create your own events. Events can be queried, and are used in some other features. You can generate custom events with APM agents, the browser monitoring agent, the mobile monitoring agents, and via the Event API. Alternatively, you can add custom attributes to some existing default New Relic events. custom instrumentation Custom instrumentation allows you to extend New Relic's monitoring to instrument code elements New Relic doesn't automatically instrument. Custom instrumentation is useful when your framework is not supported by New Relic, or when New Relic fails to pick up some element of your program. You can also use custom instrumentation to block a transaction from being reported entirely. For more information, see Custom instrumentation. custom metric Metric timeslice data that is manually recorded via an API call. Custom metrics allow you to record arbitrary metrics; for example, timing or computer resource data. All custom metric names must be prefixed with Custom/. For more information, see Custom metrics. Not to be confused with custom instrumentation data. data collector See collector. data explorer Use the data explorer to access, query and customize your data, create visualizations, and make connections between your services in a consistent and curated experience. For more on using the data explorer, see Introduction to the data explorer. degradation period When a data source enters a violating state, a degradation period of time begins. The degradation period is set in the condition's threshold. A violation will open if the source stays in a violating state for the entire degradation period. In addition: If the data source enters a non-violating state before the entire time has elapsed, the degradation period countdown is reset, and a violation does not open. If your alert condition threshold is configured as at least once in, the degradation period always lasts a single minute. dimensional metric A dimensional metric is a metric that has multiple attributes, also known as dimensions. At New Relic, we report dimensional metrics using the Metric data type. For more on other metric data types, see Metric data. Docker An open platform for distributed applications, which allows you to assemble multi-container portable apps. Infrastructure Monitoring includes integrated Docker monitoring. For more information about Docker, see the Docker website. downtime The period of time when customers cannot access your site and your app is not reporting to New Relic. For more information, see Synthetic Monitoring and Types of synthetic monitors. entity In New Relic, an entity is anything we can identify that has data you can monitor. An entity can be something you monitor directly, like applications and microservices, or indirectly, like data centers. You can identify one or more entities to be targets for alert conditions. In the Alerts API, the entity being monitored is identified with an entity_id. For more on this, see What are entities? event The word event is a general term that can have many meanings. At New Relic, event can have several meanings: At New Relic, event data is one of our core data types. Event data represents a record of a single event at a particular moment in time. Events can vary by type (for example, Transaction or Mobile, and will have associated attributes (for example, timestamp or transactionName). For more details, see Event data. For our infrastructure monitoring, the word event can be used to refer to important system and host activity. For example, a configuration change for a monitored host would be registered on Infrastructure's Events UI page. For alerts, the Events UI page displays a list of alerts-related incidents for your monitored entities. Events are reported for a violation opening and for closing. In some contexts, event can refer to any NRQL-queryable data type. For example, when you run a NRQL query, you will see a count of inspected events: this refers to a count of all data types queried. expected error An expected error is a common error that you don't want to affect your Apdex score or error rate. For more information, see Manage errors in APM. exporter At New Relic, an exporter is a type of integration that reports telemetry data to New Relic from a third-party (non-New Relic) telemetry tool. For examples, see Exporters, or search our integration quickstarts in New Relic I/O. Flex New Relic Flex is an application-agnostic, all-in-one infrastructure integration. With it, you can build your own integration that collects metric data from a wide variety of services, and that can instrument any app that exposes metrics over a standard protocol (HTTP, file, shell) in a standard format (for example, JSON or plain text) to the terminal. It's a recommended way to create a custom integration, because it doesn't require coding skills. framework A framework is a structured collection of pre-defined functions, into which an application builder inserts their own code to build their application. A framework is not the same as a library. While a library is a collection of functions you can call as needed, a framework is a skeleton for your application. The functions in that framework then call your functions. For more about the distinction between a framework and a library, see What is the difference between a framework and a library?. New Relic automatically instruments many common frameworks. For more about the frameworks New Relic supports, see the agent-specific documentation: C SDK supported frameworks Go supported frameworks Java supported frameworks .NET supported frameworks Node.js supported frameworks PHP supported frameworks Python supported frameworks Ruby supported frameworks harvest cycle The period of time between each connection from a New Relic agent to the collector. Between harvest cycles, an agent collects and caches data. At the end of the cycle an agent reports those data to the collector, then begins a new harvest cycle. health status indicator Some New Relic UI pages have a health status indicator appearing next to an index of monitored entities. This is a colored bar (generally green, yellow, red, or gray) indicating the status of your app or other entity monitored by New Relic. It also indicates whether the entity has any alert policies assigned to it and whether there are any policy violations. In general, the colored bar will be green, yellow, red, or gray to indicate the health status. Exceptions: Our REST API (v2) uses orange instead of yellow for the application's health and reporting status. Service maps use different criteria for reporting the health of a connection between an app and an external service not monitored by New Relic (for example, a third party API). host At New Relic, a host means one of the following: A physical machine is a hardware-based device with dedicated physical resources, including memory, processing, and storage. Each machine has its own OS which applications run on. A virtual machine (VM) is the software implementation of a physical machine that executes programs like a physical machine. One or more virtual machines can run on a physical machine. Each virtual machine has its own OS and allocated virtual machine resources such as RAM and CPU. A cloud instance is a type of virtual machine that is run in the public cloud. In this context, virtual machines and cloud instances are different from Java Virtual Machines (JVMs) and containers. host ID Each host identified by APM is assigned a host ID. This ID is used to uniquely identify it, and to retrieve data about that host via the REST API. For more information, see List host ID. ignored error An error that you have told the APM agent not to report to the collector. For more information, see Manage errors in APM. incident An incident is a collection of one or more violations of the conditions defined in an alert policy. An incident record includes all of the open and close time stamps for each violation, as well as chart snapshots of the data being evaluated around the time of each violation. You can view detailed information from the Incidents pages in the user interface. You can also select your preference for how we roll up violations into the incident. For an explanation of how an incident relates to other basic alerts concepts, see Concepts and workflow. Infrastructure monitoring By connecting changes in host performance to changes in your configuration, infrastructure monitoring provides real-time metrics and powerful analytics that reduce your mean-time-to-resolution (MTTR). Infrastructure is specifically designed for complex environments that need flexible, dynamic server monitoring, from a physical datacenter to thousands of Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) instances and other types of integrations. Insights Insights was the name for the New Relic product that previously governed the reporting of custom events, as well as the ability to query and chart your New Relic data. These features are now a fundamental part of the New Relic One platform and are no longer governed by the Insights product or name. To learn more about these features: Event API for reporting custom events Query and chart data For historical reasons, the word \"Insights\" is still used in some places. For example: Some APM agents still have Insights language in their codebase. For example, the Java agent custom_insights_events configuration. For New Relic organizations on our original pricing model, Insights Pro is still the product name governing custom event data ingest and retention. There is an API key called the Insights insert key. instance ID Each instance identified by New Relic is assigned a unique instance ID. Instance IDs are most commonly found for JVMs (Java Virtual Machines), but can exist for each agent. This ID is used to uniquely identify it, and to retrieve data about that instance via the REST API. For more information, see List instance IDs. instrumentation The collection of data from an application or host. When New Relic instruments a framework, it detects the methods and calls used by that framework, and intelligently groups them together. integration At New Relic, an integration refers to a solution that integrates with a specific technology (like a web framework or a type of database). All our integrations can be found as quickstarts in New Relic Instant Observability. interaction In our mobile monitoring, an interaction is a specific code path initiated by a user interaction (usually a button press). An interaction is the mobile equivalent of a transaction, and like a transaction an interaction can be traced and monitored. You can see much of the data included in an interaction in the BrowserInteraction event. interaction trace An interaction trace is a complete picture of a single interaction. With interaction traces, New Relic gives you much deeper visibility into a single slow interaction, which can help you understand a broader problem. Interaction traces are the mobile equivalent of a transaction trace. For more information, see Creating interactions (iOS) and Creating interactions (Android). inventory data Inventory data is information about the status or configuration of a service or host. Examples of inventory data include: Configuration settings Name of the host the service is on Amazon AWS region Port being used For more information, see Understand and use data. key transaction A web transaction that the user has marked as particularly important; for example, key business events (such as signups or purchase confirmations), or transactions with a high performance impact (such as searches). Key transactions have their own pages in the UI and other customized values. For more information, see Key transactions. launcher A launcher is a specific piece of code you can include when you create a New Relic One app. It creates the tile on the homepage that you click to launch the app. For more information, see the documentation about core UI components. log A log is a message about a system used to understand the activity of the system and to diagnose problems. For more information on how we use log data, see Log management. Log monitoring Our log management and monitoring features give you the tools to collect, process, explore, visualize, and alert on your log data using your existing log forwarder. With all of your log data in one place, you'll be able to make better decisions, detect and resolve problems more quickly, and see your logs in context to troubleshoot faster. Logs Our Logs feature is a scalable log management platform that allows you to connect your log data with the rest of your telemetry data. Pre-built plugins with some of the most common open-source logging tools make it simple to send your data from anywhere to New Relic. Logs in context Logs in context makes it easy to link to your log data with related data across the rest of our platform. Bringing all of this data together in a single tool allows you to quickly get to the root cause of an issue and find the log lines that you need to identify and resolve a problem. master account See parent account. metric A metric is a numeric measurement. Metric data is a broad category because there are several ways to make and report measurements. For more about how metrics are reported at New Relic, see New Relic data types. metric timeslice New Relic reports metrics in several ways. One variety of metric data is called metric timeslice data; this is the type of data used to generate many of the charts in APM, mobile monitoring, and browser monitoring (for more details, see metric timeslice data). Over time, metric timeslice data is aggregated into longer timeslice data records for more efficient storage. For more about how we aggregate this type of data, see Data aggregation. For how to query this type of data, see Query metric timeslice data. metric grouping issue A metric grouping issue occurs when an account sends too many differently named metric timeslice data points to New Relic, and those individual web transactions are not properly aggregated. For example, rather than a single /user/controlpanel/ metric name, you might see /user/controlpanel/alice, /user/controlpanel/bob, and /user/controlpanel/carol. For more information, see Metric grouping issues. minion The software that accepts monitor jobs from a private location. A minion is a packaged virtual appliance that runs in your hypervisor. For more information, see Private locations overview and install and configure private minions. Mobile monitoring Mobile monitoring allows you to monitor and manage the performance of your mobile apps on Android, iOS, tvOS, and other systems. Mobile monitoring provides end-to-end details, including crashes, throughput, HTTP requests, error traces, and more. Not to be confused with New Relic's own mobile apps for Android, iPhone, and iPad. monitor For our Synthetic Monitoring, a monitor ensures your website or API endpoint is available. For more information, see Adding and editing monitors. NerdGraph NerdGraph is our GraphQL API, an efficient and flexible query language that lets you request exactly the data you need, without over-fetching or under-fetching. NerdGraph calls get all the data you need in a single request. NerdGraph also makes it easier to evolve APIs over time and enables powerful developer tools. You can use our NerdGraph GraphiQL explorer to explore the schema and find definitions. With valid New Relic API key, you can try it out yourself at api.newrelic.com/graphiql. Nerdlet A Nerdlet is a component of a New Relic One application. It's a specific UI view, represented by a React JavaScript package. For more information, see Nerdpack file structure. Nerdpack A Nerdpack is a component of a New Relic One application. It's the package containing all the files needed by that application. For more information, see Nerdpack file structure. New Relic Edge with Infinite Tracing New Relic Edge with Infinite Tracing is a fully managed, distributed tracing service that observes 100% of your application traces, then provides actionable data so you can solve issues faster. For more information, see /docs/understand-dependencies/distributed-tracing/get-started/how-new-relic-distributed-tracing-works. New Relic One For more information, see Introduction to New Relic One. New Relic One catalog Our catalog is a collection of applications built on the New Relic One platform. The catalog includes custom apps we've built, public open source apps, and any apps that you buid. You can browse the catalog on New Relic One. NRQL (New Relic query language) NRQL is a query language, similar in form to SQL, that allows you to query the data stored in your New Relic account. non-web transaction APM identifies transactions as either web or non-web. When New Relic does not detect a transaction was initiated by a web request, this is called a non-web transaction. For more information, see Background processes and other non-web transactions. notification The message sent when an incident opens, is acknowledged, or closes. The type of notification is defined by the alert policy's notification channel. For an explanation of how notifications relate to other basic alerts concepts, see Concepts and workflow. notification channel Where we send a notification when an incident opens, is acknowledged, or closes. Available channels include email, mobile push notifications, webhooks, and more. on-host integration On-host integrations refer to integrations that reside on your own servers or hosts and that communicate with our infrastructure agent. For more information, see Introduction to on-host integrations. owner For accounts on our original pricing model, this is a type of user role: the user who initially created the account. For more information, see Users. page load timing With page load timing, New Relic monitors the full load time for end-user browsers. New Relic's application agents dynamically inject JavaScript into the page, then capture the following key load points: Navigation start: The user initiates the transaction. First byte: The browser receives the requested page. DOM ready: The browser has finished parsing DOM. Page ready: Page loading is complete. Page load timing is sometimes referred to as RUM, or real user monitoring. Unlike standard RUM, page load timing also captures JavaScript errors and AJAX requests. For more information, see Page load timing process. parameter Deprecated term; see attribute. parent account New Relic organizations can have a parent/child account structure. This structure was much more important for organizations on our original user model, but is still used for some features for organizations on the New Relic One user model. Learn more about account structure. Parent accounts were previously referred to as \"master accounts\", and child accounts were previously referred to as \"sub-accounts\". permalink A unique URL that links to a view of your application at a specific point in time. Permalinks are useful for troubleshooting and for sharing interesting time windows with colleagues. pinger The component of New Relic that connects to your website to verify your website is accessible. New Relic has pingers in Europe, Asia, and the United States. Each pinger attempts to contact your website at least once every two minutes. If enough pingers are unable to reach your website, your application will be considered down. For in-depth scriptable testing, including real browser tests and tests of API endpoints, see Synthetic Monitoring. Synthetic Monitoring includes free ping monitoring, which allows you to monitor your website from locations around the world. For more information, see Types of Synthetic monitors. polling interval (AWS) Our Amazon integrations query your AWS services according to a polling interval, which varies depending on the integration. Each polling interval occurs for every AWS entity. For example, if you have thirteen Elastic Load Balancers (ELB), each one will be polled every five minutes. Depending on the AWS integration, there may be delays in the timing between the API request and the metric data returned. If you notice unusual delays, follow the integration troubleshooting procedures. PPM (pages per minute) The number of pages per minute your application serves. private location A Synthetic monitor feature that allows you to run Synthetic monitors from within your own systems by creating private minions. Private locations allow you to extend your Synthetic coverage to new geographical locations, and to monitor websites behind your firewall such as an intranet site. For more information, see Private locations overview. recovery period A recovery period of time begins when a data source enters a non-violating state after being in a violating state. The recovery period is set in the condition's threshold. A violation will close when a source remains in a non-violating state and the recovery period time has elapsed. If the data source enters a violating state before the time has elapsed, the recovery period clock will reset and the violation won't close. response time The duration of time between a request for service and a response. For more information, see Response time. restricted user A type of user role on a New Relic account. For more information, see Users. rollup Using the same application name for multiple applications. This allows you to combine data in APM, either from multiple applications, or from multiple instances of an application. For more information, see Rolling up app data. root span For distributed tracing, the root span is the first span in a trace. In many cases, the root span duration will represent the duration of the entire trace, or be very close to it. However, for more complex, modern systems that use a lot of asynchronous, non-blocking processes, this will not be true. For those systems, the root span’s duration may be significantly less than the duration of the trace. RPM The term RPM usually refers to the number of requests per minute your application receives from users. This is usually the same as CPM (calls per minute). Historically, some New Relic monitoring solutions, like APM and Browser Monitoring, used to contain RPM in the URL; for example, https://rpm.newrelic.com. This language use originally referred to Rails performance management because the first iteration of our product monitored Ruby on Rails applications. We monitor many more languages and systems than Ruby now. RUM (real user monitoring) See page load timing. runbook A runbook contains standard procedures and operations typically used by system administrators, network operations staff, and other personnel to handle outages, alert incidents, and other situations. If your organization stores runbook instructions as URLs, you can link this information to an alerts policy so your personnel has easy access to this information when an incident violates the defined policy thresholds. SAML (Security Assertion Markup Language) SAML is an XML-based data format for sharing authentication data between two parties. New Relic accounts must obtain a SAML certificate in order to enable Single Sign On for their users. For more information, see SAML service providers. Selenium Selenium is an open-source browser testing suite. Synthetics uses Selenium to test monitored websites with real browsers. For more information, see monitor types. service A service is a cluster of runtime server processes that accomplish a particular task, usually service requests. Unlike an application, a service is not usually invoked by a human. New Relic offers a variety of integrations that allow you to report data from your services. signal The stream of telemetry data that's watched and alerted on. You use NRQL queries to define a signal. signal filter When we receive data and it's routed to the streaming alerts platform, your NRQL WHERE clause will filter the data coming in. The filtered streaming data is what's evaluated for loss of signal violations, for example. span In a distributed trace, a span is a \"named, timed operation representing a contiguous segment of work in that trace\" (from OpenTracing.io definition). For distributed tracing, spans are displayed in the distributed tracing UI, and the data type Span is available to be queried. See also root span. SSL certificate SSL certificates encrypt data that is being transmitted. While New Relic refers to security certificates as SSL because it is a more commonly used term, all certificates adhere to industry standards for secure encryption in transit. SSO (single sign on) SSO (single sign on) allows you to manage user authentication in New Relic using an external SSO provider. For more information, see Setting up SSO. streaming algorithm This is what determines when the data in an aggregation window is processed. The streaming algorithm uses your server's clock time and the aggregation window size to trigger the alert evaluation process. sub-accounts See master account. Synthetic monitoring Synthetic monitoring allows you to monitor your website or API endpoint via automated, scriptable tools. Use free ping monitor to ensure your website is accessible, or expand your monitoring with browser monitors, which test your website with real browsers. Go further with scripting, to script browsers or API monitors for sophisticated testing. target A target is a resource or component monitored by a New Relic monitoring tool that has been identified in an alert condition. When the data source for that target crosses the defined critical threshold, we will open a violation. Depending on your policy's Incident preference setting, Alerts may create an incident record and send notifications through the defined channels. See also entity. tag Tags are key:value metadata added to monitored apps, hosts, dashboards, and other entities to help you organize your data at a high level. For details, see Tags. thresholds Thresholds are alert condition settings that define a violation. Threshold values include the value a data source must pass to trigger a violation and the time-related settings that define a violation; for example: Passing a certain value for at least x minutes Passing a certain value only once in x minutes While the data source passes a certain value, a degradation period starts. Likewise, when that data source stops passing a certain value, a recovery period starts. The durations of these two time periods are defined in the alert condition threshold settings. Thresholds have a required critical (red) threshold and an optional warning (yellow) threshold. In the UI, the entity's health status indicator will change to yellow or red when a threshold has been crossed and a violation will open. For more information, see Define thresholds. For an explanation of how thresholds relate to other basic Alerts concepts, see Concepts and workflow. throughput Throughput is a measurement of user activity for a monitored application. APM throughput and Browser Monitoring throughput are measured in different ways: APM: requests per minute (RPM) Browser: page views per minute (PPM) tier A tier can refer to how New Relic categorizes or visualizes the various agent language ecosystems that we support. For example: In APM, the color-coded categories that appear on your app's main Overview chart show response time spent in various functions, processes, or agents as tiers; for example, request queuing, garbage collection, Middleware, JVMs, etc. In New Relic labels, TIER can be used to define or classify the client-server architecture; for example, front-end and back-end tiers. \"Tier\" may sometimes be used to refer to our pricing editions. time picker By default the New Relic UI shows data for the past 30 minutes, ending now. To change the time window, use the time picker. time range A time range can refer to a length of time selected in the New Relic UI. New Relic displays a time range depending on the range you select using the time picker. timeslice data See metric timeslice data. trace A trace is a description of how a request travels through a system. Trace data helps you understand the performance of your system and diagnose problems. For more information on how we use trace data, see New Relic data types. traffic light See health status. transaction A transaction is defined as one logical unit of work in an application. This term primarily refers to server-side transactions monitored by APM. For more information, see documentation about web transactions and non-web transactions. The term transaction is also sometimes used in Browser Monitoring. In that case, it primarily refers to activity beginning with a browser-side web request and ending with a complete page load. transaction trace A transaction trace is a complete picture of a single transaction, down to the database queries and exact invocation patterns. With transaction traces, New Relic gives you much deeper visibility into a single slow transaction, which can help you understand a broader problem. For more information, see Transaction traces. UI The New Relic user interface. For more information, see Standard page functions. user A user can refer to a specific user role in a New Relic account. For more information, see Users. UTC Universal Time Coordinated (UTC), or Coordinated Universal Time, is a standard timestamp for synchronizing time around the world. value function (metrics) The numeric value obtained from metric timeslice data; for example, an average, minimum, maximum, total, sample size, etc. violation A violation occurs when the entity monitored by an alert condition reports a value that crosses the thresholds defined in that condition. For an explanation of how violations relate to other basic alerts concepts, see Concepts and workflow. You can view a summary of the violations for a selected incident's page. You can also view the violations for a specific entity from the product's UI. web external Web external is the term applied to the portion of time spent in transactions to external applications from within the code of the application you are monitoring. That time can be a call to a third party company (a payment provider, for example) or it could be a call to another microservice within your own company. Web external demonstrates how performance is impacted by your code executing outside the application you are measuring. web transaction A transaction is defined as one logical unit of work in an application. This term primarily refers to server-side transactions monitored by APM. Web transactions are initiated with an HTTP request. For most organizations, these represent customer-centric interactions and thus are the most important transactions to monitor. For more information, see Web transactions and Non-web transactions. WebDriverJS WebDriver is a Selenium component, used to control Synthetics scripted browsers. Specifically, Synthetics uses WebDriverJS, a Node.js-based flavor of Selenium. For more information, see Writing scripted browsers and Scripted browser examples. workload A workload represents a group of entities that work together to provide a digital service. For more information, see Workloads.",

      "body": "New Relic's global data hosting structure consists of two regions: the European Union (EU) region and the United States (US) region. Selecting your preferred region during the account setup process allows you to specify the region where your performance monitoring data will be hosted. You can also create accounts in each region. Requirements Access to the New Relic EU region requires the latest agent version. For new customers: Install the most recent agent version. For existing customers: Update to the most recent agent version. Minimum agent version required: C SDK 1.0.0 or higher Go 2.0.0 or higher Java 4.0.0 or higher .NET 8.0.0 or higher Node.js 3.0.0 or higher PHP 8.0.0.204 or higher Python 3.0.0.89 or higher Ruby 5.0.0.342 or higher Regions and availability Your choice of data center is not limited by your geographic location. You can choose to create an account with data hosted in either the EU or US region, regardless of where you or your systems reside. You can also create accounts in each region. New Relic offers almost all the same active products, features, support offerings, and performance levels in the EU region as what is offered in the US region. Exceptions: The following are not supported with an EU region account: Infinite Tracing is not available. APM's weekly performance reports are not available. Errors inbox is not available. Log patterns Deprecated products and features are not available. New Relic's Incident Intelligence service operates solely in the US whether you store your data in New Relic’s US region data center or New Relic’s EU region data center, by using New Relic Incident Intelligence, you consent that New Relic may move and store your data in the US region. New Relic CodeStream operates solely in the US. Whether you have selected New Relic's US or EU region data center during setup of your New Relic account, when using New Relic CodeStream, you consent that your New Relic CodeStream data will get stored in the US. Regions and account hierarchy You can create accounts in each region. If your data is currently being hosted in the US region, you must create a new account to store data in the EU region. You cannot view EU data from a US account, or US data from an EU account. The data collected remains separate. The data cannot be aggregated or migrated between accounts. For organizations that have a parent/child account structure, you can only have one parent account. For more, see Manage apps or users with child accounts. For partnership accounts, no changes to the partnership owner account are required. However, data cannot be shared across regions, so a partnership requires a parent account for each region. Hierarchy example for partnership accounts With partnership accounts, a new parent account must be created for any data to be host in the EU region. This hierarchy illustrates how global accounts are structured with partnership owner accounts. Data is not aggregated beyond the parent account. Example hierarchy for partnership organizations. Because data cannot be shared across regions, a partnership will require a parent account for each region. Create an EU region account To create a New Relic account in the EU region: Go to the New Relic signup page. OR If you have a specific offer from a New Relic partner, follow that link directly. Follow the online steps to create your account. From the Select your region dropdown, select European Union. Agree to the Terms of Service. When you receive an email confirmation message, select the link to confirm your account and sign in to New Relic. Then install or update to the most recent agent version. API endpoints for EU region accounts If you have an EU region account, use the appropriate endpoints to access the following New Relic APIs: API EU endpoint Browser source maps API sourcemaps.service. eu .newrelic.com Copy Infrastructure Alert API infra-api. eu .newrelic.com Copy Dashboard API rpm. eu .newrelic.com/api/explore/dashboards/list Copy Insert API insights-collector. eu01 .nr-data.net Copy Insights Query API insights-api. eu .newrelic.com Copy Mobile apps rpm. eu .newrelic.com/mobile Copy NerdGraph GraphiQL API api. eu .newrelic.com/graphiql Copy Partner API The partner API is a global API with no regional data differences. Use this endpoint for both EU and US accounts: rpm.newrelic.com/api/v2/partners/ Copy REST API api. eu .newrelic.com Copy Synthetics API synthetics. eu .newrelic.com/synthetics/api Copy Trace API trace-api. eu .newrelic.com/trace/v1 Copy Metric API metric-api. eu .newrelic.com/metric/v1 Copy Log API log-api. eu .newrelic.com/log/v1 Copy Access New Relic One If your accounts report data to the EU data center, use the following link to go to New Relic One: one.eu.newrelic.com. Billing and pricing New Relic's account billing process and pricing options are the same for both the EU and US regions. Operational access and processing Customer Data is hosted in the region selected during account creation. Systems Operations Data is stored in the US region. All other information, including account information (such as license subscription information, billing, and internal monitoring) is hosted in the US region and replicated in the EU region. New Relic may access and process Customer Data in the United States and such other jurisdictions where New Relic has affiliates and subsidiaries, including as may be necessary to maintain, secure, or perform the services, to provide technical support, or as necessary to comply with law or a binding order of a government body. Customer Data from existing New Relic accounts cannot be transferred or shared across regions, and new data generated cannot be shared with existing accounts, even in partnership accounts. Verify your account is based in EU region Use either of these options to verify whether your account data is hosted in the EU region's data center: In APM, mouse over the application name to view the URL. If it begins with rpm.eu.newrelic.com/, it is an EU-based account. Check your New Relic license key. If it begins with EU, it is an EU-based account.",

      "body": "A glossary of common terminology you may encounter. account dropdown In the upper right of the New Relic UI, the account dropdown gives you access to your account settings. If you're trying to switch between accounts, use the account switcher. account switcher If you have access to more than one account in a multi-account organization, you can use the account switcher to switch between accounts. This is located in the top right of most New Relic UI pages. For more on factors that affect access to accounts, see Factors affecting access. To find account settings, use the account dropdown. administrator A type of user role on a New Relic account. For more information, see Users. agent At New Relic, an agent is a piece of monitoring software that provides integrations with various technologies (for example, web frameworks, host operating systems, or database types). The agents send that data to New Relic, usually on a specific cadence. For more information, see: New Relic Instant Observability Install agents agent API Some New Relic agents have agent APIs that allow you to extend the functionality of an agent. You can use the API to control, customize and extend the functionality of the agent. Here are some agent API docs: APM agents: C SDK API Go agent API Java agent API .NET agent API Node.js agent API PHP agent API Ruby agent API Python agent API Browser agent: Browser agent API Mobile agents: iOS SDK API Android SDK API aggregated metrics Aggregated metric data summarizes calls to specific methods in your application, including how many times each one was called and response times. In the New Relic UI, you see the class and method names along with their aggregate numbers. Metric data aggregation depends on the New Relic tool and your subscription level. For more information, see the documentation about data retention. aggregation delay The length of time in seconds to wait for the aggregation window to fill with data. Required when using CADENCE or EVENT_FLOW aggreation_method types. aggregation function You can use NRQL query functions, such as sum(), average(), or latest() to choose how the data points in an aggregation window should be processed into a single data point. The single aggregated data point is what's passed through the alert evaluation process. aggregation method New Relic aggregates data into windows, and needs to determine when the current window ends and the next one begins. The aggregation_method is the logic that tells us when we have all the data for a given aggregation window. Once the window is closed, the data is aggregated into a single point and evaluated against the threshold. This field is optional. One of the following three values can be specified: EVENT_FLOW: (Default) Each aggregation window will wait until it starts to see timestamps arrive that are past its own delay setting. Once this occurs, the data is published. Relies on the timestamps of arriving data, so wall-clock time is no longer relevant. Works best for sources that come in frequently and with low event spread (high througput metrics) CADENCE: Classic New Relic logic where each evaluation window waits exactly as long as the aggregation_delay setting, using the wall-clock time as a timer. aggregation_delay is required when using this option. Data arriving too late will be dropped, which can cause false alerts. EVENT_TIMER: Each aggregation window has a timer on it, set to the aggregation_timer setting. The Timer starts running as soon as the first data point appears for that aggregation window (based on the data point’s timestamp). The aggregation_timer is reset for each new data point that arrives for that window. Once the aggregation_timer reaches 0, the aggregation window is published. Ideal for sparse and batched data, such as cloud integrations and infrequent error logs. aggregation timer The length of time in seconds to wait after each data point received, to ensure the entire batch is processed. Required when using EVENT_TIMER aggregation_method type. aggregation window Streaming alerts gathers data together into specific amounts of time. These windows of time are customizable. Data points are collected together based their timestamps and reported as a batch. The customizable aggregation window provides greater flexibility and fewer false violations when alerting on irregular or less frequent data points. alert An alert communicates an event or incident that designated personnel can track through Alerts. For an explanation of how basic alerts concepts are related, see Concepts and workflow. alert condition An alert condition (or condition), identified by its unique numeric condition_id, contains the criteria for creating a violation. The condition includes the threshold that is set for a metric timeslice or a custom metric over time on a chosen target. For an explanation of how a condition relates to other basic alerts concepts, see Concepts and workflow. alert evaluation Streaming data is assessed on a set of aggregation windows to determine if an alert condition is violating or recovering. The aggregation window time is how long we'll collect data before running the NRQL query condition. The offset evaluation time is how long you want us to wait for late data before assessing it. If a window doesn't have any data points, it's treated as a gap for loss of signal. alert policy A collection of one or more conditions, one or more notification channels, and an Incident preference setting. If a condition contained within the policy opens a violation, an incident may be opened depending on the Incident preference setting. Notifications will then be sent to all channels attached to the policy. For an explanation of how a policy relates to other basic alerts concepts, see Concepts and workflow. apdex Apdex is an industry-standard way to measure users' satisfaction with the response time of an application or service. New Relic rates each response as Satisfied, Tolerated, or Frustrated, and uses these ratings to calculate an overall user satisfaction score. For more information, see Apdex: Measure user satisfaction. apdex_f The response time above which a transaction are rated frustrating. Defaults to four times apdex_t. Requests that complete in less than apdex_t are rated satisfied. Requests that take longer than apdex_t, but less than four times apdex_t (apdex_f), are tolerated. Any requests that take longer than apdex_f are rated frustrating. For more information, see Apdex: Measure user satisfaction. apdex_t The response time above which a transaction is considered tolerable. The default value is 0.5 seconds, but you can change this in your Apdex settings. Requests that complete in less than apdex_t are rated satisfied. Requests that take more than apdex_t, but less than apdex_f, are tolerated. Any requests that take longer than apdex_f are rated frustrating. For more information, see Apdex: Measure user satisfaction. API (application programming interface) New Relic offers a variety of APIs and SDKs. For more information, see the introduction to New Relic's APIs. APM New Relic's APM (application performance monitoring) provides monitoring of your web or non-web application's performance. APM supports apps using several programming languages. application For New Relic purposes, any program instrumented by New Relic. application ID Some New Relic solutions assign a monitored application a unique application ID, often shortened to app ID. When present, this ID is available in the UI. It is also reported as an attribute and can be queried. For how to determine this, see Find app ID. application name The name that New Relic combines with your license key to uniquely identify a particular app. For more information, see Name your application. Applied Intelligence (AI) Applied Intelligence (AI) helps you find, troubleshoot, and resolve problems more quickly. Specifically, it’s a hybrid machine learning engine that reduces alert noise, correlates incidents, and automatically detects anomalies. Applied Intelligence includes Alerts, Incident Intelligence, and Proactive Detection. attribute Attributes are key-value pairs attached to data objects reported to New Relic. Attributes add detail, and they're similar to tags or labels in other SaaS software. You can explore this data by querying or searching via the UI or by using the data dictionary. Examples: APM reports a Transaction event. This includes timing data for the transaction in a duration attribute, which might have a value of .002. Our Infrastructure Monitoring reports a ProcessSample event. This includes a variety of CPU usage attributes, including a cpuSystemPercent attribute, which might have a value of .01. Our Telemetry SDK reports a Metric data type for storing metrics, with attached attributes like metricName and newrelic.source. Some New Relic tools allow you to report custom attributes to enhance your monitoring. For more information about attributes in APM, see Agent attributes. availability monitoring See Types of Synthetics monitors. browser The New Relic UI supports most browsers. For more information, see Supported browsers. For our end-user browser monitoring tool, see Browser Monitoring. Browser monitoring A Real User Monitoring (RUM) solution that measures the speed and performance of your end users as they navigate to your site from different web browsers, devices, operating systems, and networks. background external See web external. child account See parent account. cloud-based integration New Relic offers cloud-based integrations with providers such as Amazon Web Services (AWS), Microsoft Azure, and Google Cloud Platform. collector The component that collects data from New Relic agents running on an app server, mobile device, or end-user browser. While the agent is installed on a user's app server, the collectors are centrally located in New Relic's data center. In order to contact the collector, the agent must be able to reach New Relic's domains and IP addresses. (The exact domain or IP depends on the New Relic monitoring tool.) The collector receives and interprets this data, and stores it in a database. The data is then retrieved and presented in the New Relic UI and by our various REST APIs. Command line interface (CLI) Our command line interface (CLI) is a tool you can use to build a New Relic application. This is the same tool our own engineers use. Go here for quick start instructions. Go to our Developer site for sample apps and guides. compute unit (CU) A unit of measurement that determines your pricing for some New Relic products governed by our original product-based pricing model. For more information, see Compute unit pricing. condition_id See alert condition. CPM (calls per minute) The number of calls your application receives each minute. This usually corresponds to the number of page views or external connections, and is usually the same as RPM (requests per minute). CPU burn The time consumed by code minus the wait time for a transaction. This is the time actually spent processing the transaction. It appears in the New Relic UI at the top of the transaction view for the agents that provide it (Ruby and PHP only). custom attribute A key-value pair added to a transaction or event in order to gain additional information about it. For more information, see custom attributes. custom dashboard A customizable dashboard with charts and tables that includes data from multiple New Relic data sources. For more information, see dashboards. custom event An event, in New Relic terms, is a data object with attached attributes. New Relic reports default event types, like Transaction and TransactionError. You can also create your own events. Events can be queried, and are used in some other features. You can generate custom events with APM agents, the browser monitoring agent, the mobile monitoring agents, and via the Event API. Alternatively, you can add custom attributes to some existing default New Relic events. custom instrumentation Custom instrumentation allows you to extend New Relic's monitoring to instrument code elements New Relic doesn't automatically instrument. Custom instrumentation is useful when your framework is not supported by New Relic, or when New Relic fails to pick up some element of your program. You can also use custom instrumentation to block a transaction from being reported entirely. For more information, see Custom instrumentation. custom metric Metric timeslice data that is manually recorded via an API call. Custom metrics allow you to record arbitrary metrics; for example, timing or computer resource data. All custom metric names must be prefixed with Custom/. For more information, see Custom metrics. Not to be confused with custom instrumentation data. data collector See collector. data explorer Use the data explorer to access, query and customize your data, create visualizations, and make connections between your services in a consistent and curated experience. For more on using the data explorer, see Introduction to the data explorer. degradation period When a data source enters a violating state, a degradation period of time begins. The degradation period is set in the condition's threshold. A violation will open if the source stays in a violating state for the entire degradation period. In addition: If the data source enters a non-violating state before the entire time has elapsed, the degradation period countdown is reset, and a violation does not open. If your alert condition threshold is configured as at least once in, the degradation period always lasts a single minute. dimensional metric A dimensional metric is a metric that has multiple attributes, also known as dimensions. At New Relic, we report dimensional metrics using the Metric data type. For more on other metric data types, see Metric data. Docker An open platform for distributed applications, which allows you to assemble multi-container portable apps. Infrastructure Monitoring includes integrated Docker monitoring. For more information about Docker, see the Docker website. downtime The period of time when customers cannot access your site and your app is not reporting to New Relic. For more information, see Synthetic Monitoring and Types of synthetic monitors. entity In New Relic, an entity is anything we can identify that has data you can monitor. An entity can be something you monitor directly, like applications and microservices, or indirectly, like data centers. You can identify one or more entities to be targets for alert conditions. In the Alerts API, the entity being monitored is identified with an entity_id. For more on this, see What are entities? event The word event is a general term that can have many meanings. At New Relic, event can have several meanings: At New Relic, event data is one of our core data types. Event data represents a record of a single event at a particular moment in time. Events can vary by type (for example, Transaction or Mobile, and will have associated attributes (for example, timestamp or transactionName). For more details, see Event data. For our infrastructure monitoring, the word event can be used to refer to important system and host activity. For example, a configuration change for a monitored host would be registered on Infrastructure's Events UI page. For alerts, the Events UI page displays a list of alerts-related incidents for your monitored entities. Events are reported for a violation opening and for closing. In some contexts, event can refer to any NRQL-queryable data type. For example, when you run a NRQL query, you will see a count of inspected events: this refers to a count of all data types queried. expected error An expected error is a common error that you don't want to affect your Apdex score or error rate. For more information, see Manage errors in APM. exporter At New Relic, an exporter is a type of integration that reports telemetry data to New Relic from a third-party (non-New Relic) telemetry tool. For examples, see Exporters, or search our integration quickstarts in New Relic I/O. Flex New Relic Flex is an application-agnostic, all-in-one infrastructure integration. With it, you can build your own integration that collects metric data from a wide variety of services, and that can instrument any app that exposes metrics over a standard protocol (HTTP, file, shell) in a standard format (for example, JSON or plain text) to the terminal. It's a recommended way to create a custom integration, because it doesn't require coding skills. framework A framework is a structured collection of pre-defined functions, into which an application builder inserts their own code to build their application. A framework is not the same as a library. While a library is a collection of functions you can call as needed, a framework is a skeleton for your application. The functions in that framework then call your functions. For more about the distinction between a framework and a library, see What is the difference between a framework and a library?. New Relic automatically instruments many common frameworks. For more about the frameworks New Relic supports, see the agent-specific documentation: C SDK supported frameworks Go supported frameworks Java supported frameworks .NET supported frameworks Node.js supported frameworks PHP supported frameworks Python supported frameworks Ruby supported frameworks harvest cycle The period of time between each connection from a New Relic agent to the collector. Between harvest cycles, an agent collects and caches data. At the end of the cycle an agent reports those data to the collector, then begins a new harvest cycle. health status indicator Some New Relic UI pages have a health status indicator appearing next to an index of monitored entities. This is a colored bar (generally green, yellow, red, or gray) indicating the status of your app or other entity monitored by New Relic. It also indicates whether the entity has any alert policies assigned to it and whether there are any policy violations. In general, the colored bar will be green, yellow, red, or gray to indicate the health status. Exceptions: Our REST API (v2) uses orange instead of yellow for the application's health and reporting status. Service maps use different criteria for reporting the health of a connection between an app and an external service not monitored by New Relic (for example, a third party API). host At New Relic, a host means one of the following: A physical machine is a hardware-based device with dedicated physical resources, including memory, processing, and storage. Each machine has its own OS which applications run on. A virtual machine (VM) is the software implementation of a physical machine that executes programs like a physical machine. One or more virtual machines can run on a physical machine. Each virtual machine has its own OS and allocated virtual machine resources such as RAM and CPU. A cloud instance is a type of virtual machine that is run in the public cloud. In this context, virtual machines and cloud instances are different from Java Virtual Machines (JVMs) and containers. host ID Each host identified by APM is assigned a host ID. This ID is used to uniquely identify it, and to retrieve data about that host via the REST API. For more information, see List host ID. ignored error An error that you have told the APM agent not to report to the collector. For more information, see Manage errors in APM. incident An incident is a collection of one or more violations of the conditions defined in an alert policy. An incident record includes all of the open and close time stamps for each violation, as well as chart snapshots of the data being evaluated around the time of each violation. You can view detailed information from the Incidents pages in the user interface. You can also select your preference for how we roll up violations into the incident. For an explanation of how an incident relates to other basic alerts concepts, see Concepts and workflow. Infrastructure monitoring By connecting changes in host performance to changes in your configuration, infrastructure monitoring provides real-time metrics and powerful analytics that reduce your mean-time-to-resolution (MTTR). Infrastructure is specifically designed for complex environments that need flexible, dynamic server monitoring, from a physical datacenter to thousands of Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) instances and other types of integrations. Insights Insights was the name for the New Relic product that previously governed the reporting of custom events, as well as the ability to query and chart your New Relic data. These features are now a fundamental part of the New Relic One platform and are no longer governed by the Insights product or name. To learn more about these features: Event API for reporting custom events Query and chart data For historical reasons, the word \"Insights\" is still used in some places. For example: Some APM agents still have Insights language in their codebase. For example, the Java agent custom_insights_events configuration. For New Relic organizations on our original pricing model, Insights Pro is still the product name governing custom event data ingest and retention. There is an API key called the Insights insert key. instance ID Each instance identified by New Relic is assigned a unique instance ID. Instance IDs are most commonly found for JVMs (Java Virtual Machines), but can exist for each agent. This ID is used to uniquely identify it, and to retrieve data about that instance via the REST API. For more information, see List instance IDs. instrumentation The collection of data from an application or host. When New Relic instruments a framework, it detects the methods and calls used by that framework, and intelligently groups them together. integration At New Relic, an integration refers to a solution that integrates with a specific technology (like a web framework or a type of database). All our integrations can be found as quickstarts in New Relic Instant Observability. interaction In our mobile monitoring, an interaction is a specific code path initiated by a user interaction (usually a button press). An interaction is the mobile equivalent of a transaction, and like a transaction an interaction can be traced and monitored. You can see much of the data included in an interaction in the BrowserInteraction event. interaction trace An interaction trace is a complete picture of a single interaction. With interaction traces, New Relic gives you much deeper visibility into a single slow interaction, which can help you understand a broader problem. Interaction traces are the mobile equivalent of a transaction trace. For more information, see Creating interactions (iOS) and Creating interactions (Android). inventory data Inventory data is information about the status or configuration of a service or host. Examples of inventory data include: Configuration settings Name of the host the service is on Amazon AWS region Port being used For more information, see Understand and use data. key transaction A web transaction that the user has marked as particularly important; for example, key business events (such as signups or purchase confirmations), or transactions with a high performance impact (such as searches). Key transactions have their own pages in the UI and other customized values. For more information, see Key transactions. launcher A launcher is a specific piece of code you can include when you create a New Relic One app. It creates the tile on the homepage that you click to launch the app. For more information, see the documentation about core UI components. log A log is a message about a system used to understand the activity of the system and to diagnose problems. For more information on how we use log data, see Log management. Log monitoring Our log management and monitoring features give you the tools to collect, process, explore, visualize, and alert on your log data using your existing log forwarder. With all of your log data in one place, you'll be able to make better decisions, detect and resolve problems more quickly, and see your logs in context to troubleshoot faster. Logs Our Logs feature is a scalable log management platform that allows you to connect your log data with the rest of your telemetry data. Pre-built plugins with some of the most common open-source logging tools make it simple to send your data from anywhere to New Relic. Logs in context Logs in context makes it easy to link to your log data with related data across the rest of our platform. Bringing all of this data together in a single tool allows you to quickly get to the root cause of an issue and find the log lines that you need to identify and resolve a problem. master account See parent account. metric A metric is a numeric measurement. Metric data is a broad category because there are several ways to make and report measurements. For more about how metrics are reported at New Relic, see New Relic data types. metric timeslice New Relic reports metrics in several ways. One variety of metric data is called metric timeslice data; this is the type of data used to generate many of the charts in APM, mobile monitoring, and browser monitoring (for more details, see metric timeslice data). Over time, metric timeslice data is aggregated into longer timeslice data records for more efficient storage. For more about how we aggregate this type of data, see Data aggregation. For how to query this type of data, see Query metric timeslice data. metric grouping issue A metric grouping issue occurs when an account sends too many differently named metric timeslice data points to New Relic, and those individual web transactions are not properly aggregated. For example, rather than a single /user/controlpanel/ metric name, you might see /user/controlpanel/alice, /user/controlpanel/bob, and /user/controlpanel/carol. For more information, see Metric grouping issues. minion The software that accepts monitor jobs from a private location. A minion is a packaged virtual appliance that runs in your hypervisor. For more information, see Private locations overview and install and configure private minions. Mobile monitoring Mobile monitoring allows you to monitor and manage the performance of your mobile apps on Android, iOS, tvOS, and other systems. Mobile monitoring provides end-to-end details, including crashes, throughput, HTTP requests, error traces, and more. Not to be confused with New Relic's own mobile apps for Android, iPhone, and iPad. monitor For our Synthetic Monitoring, a monitor ensures your website or API endpoint is available. For more information, see Adding and editing monitors. NerdGraph NerdGraph is our GraphQL API, an efficient and flexible query language that lets you request exactly the data you need, without over-fetching or under-fetching. NerdGraph calls get all the data you need in a single request. NerdGraph also makes it easier to evolve APIs over time and enables powerful developer tools. You can use our NerdGraph GraphiQL explorer to explore the schema and find definitions. With valid New Relic API key, you can try it out yourself at api.newrelic.com/graphiql. Nerdlet A Nerdlet is a component of a New Relic One application. It's a specific UI view, represented by a React JavaScript package. For more information, see Nerdpack file structure. Nerdpack A Nerdpack is a component of a New Relic One application. It's the package containing all the files needed by that application. For more information, see Nerdpack file structure. New Relic Edge with Infinite Tracing New Relic Edge with Infinite Tracing is a fully managed, distributed tracing service that observes 100% of your application traces, then provides actionable data so you can solve issues faster. For more information, see /docs/understand-dependencies/distributed-tracing/get-started/how-new-relic-distributed-tracing-works. New Relic One For more information, see Introduction to New Relic One. New Relic One catalog Our catalog is a collection of applications built on the New Relic One platform. The catalog includes custom apps we've built, public open source apps, and any apps that you buid. You can browse the catalog on New Relic One. NRQL (New Relic query language) NRQL is a query language, similar in form to SQL, that allows you to query the data stored in your New Relic account. non-web transaction APM identifies transactions as either web or non-web. When New Relic does not detect a transaction was initiated by a web request, this is called a non-web transaction. For more information, see Background processes and other non-web transactions. notification The message sent when an incident opens, is acknowledged, or closes. The type of notification is defined by the alert policy's notification channel. For an explanation of how notifications relate to other basic alerts concepts, see Concepts and workflow. notification channel Where we send a notification when an incident opens, is acknowledged, or closes. Available channels include email, mobile push notifications, webhooks, and more. on-host integration On-host integrations refer to integrations that reside on your own servers or hosts and that communicate with our infrastructure agent. For more information, see Introduction to on-host integrations. owner For accounts on our original pricing model, this is a type of user role: the user who initially created the account. For more information, see Users. page load timing With page load timing, New Relic monitors the full load time for end-user browsers. New Relic's application agents dynamically inject JavaScript into the page, then capture the following key load points: Navigation start: The user initiates the transaction. First byte: The browser receives the requested page. DOM ready: The browser has finished parsing DOM. Page ready: Page loading is complete. Page load timing is sometimes referred to as RUM, or real user monitoring. Unlike standard RUM, page load timing also captures JavaScript errors and AJAX requests. For more information, see Page load timing process. parameter Deprecated term; see attribute. parent account New Relic organizations can have a parent/child account structure. This structure was much more important for organizations on our original user model, but is still used for some features for organizations on the New Relic One user model. Learn more about account structure. Parent accounts were previously referred to as \"master accounts\", and child accounts were previously referred to as \"sub-accounts\". permalink A unique URL that links to a view of your application at a specific point in time. Permalinks are useful for troubleshooting and for sharing interesting time windows with colleagues. pinger The component of New Relic that connects to your website to verify your website is accessible. New Relic has pingers in Europe, Asia, and the United States. Each pinger attempts to contact your website at least once every two minutes. If enough pingers are unable to reach your website, your application will be considered down. For in-depth scriptable testing, including real browser tests and tests of API endpoints, see Synthetic Monitoring. Synthetic Monitoring includes free ping monitoring, which allows you to monitor your website from locations around the world. For more information, see Types of Synthetic monitors. polling interval (AWS) Our Amazon integrations query your AWS services according to a polling interval, which varies depending on the integration. Each polling interval occurs for every AWS entity. For example, if you have thirteen Elastic Load Balancers (ELB), each one will be polled every five minutes. Depending on the AWS integration, there may be delays in the timing between the API request and the metric data returned. If you notice unusual delays, follow the integration troubleshooting procedures. PPM (pages per minute) The number of pages per minute your application serves. private location A Synthetic monitor feature that allows you to run Synthetic monitors from within your own systems by creating private minions. Private locations allow you to extend your Synthetic coverage to new geographical locations, and to monitor websites behind your firewall such as an intranet site. For more information, see Private locations overview. recovery period A recovery period of time begins when a data source enters a non-violating state after being in a violating state. The recovery period is set in the condition's threshold. A violation will close when a source remains in a non-violating state and the recovery period time has elapsed. If the data source enters a violating state before the time has elapsed, the recovery period clock will reset and the violation won't close. response time The duration of time between a request for service and a response. For more information, see Response time. restricted user A type of user role on a New Relic account. For more information, see Users. rollup Using the same application name for multiple applications. This allows you to combine data in APM, either from multiple applications, or from multiple instances of an application. For more information, see Rolling up app data. root span For distributed tracing, the root span is the first span in a trace. In many cases, the root span duration will represent the duration of the entire trace, or be very close to it. However, for more complex, modern systems that use a lot of asynchronous, non-blocking processes, this will not be true. For those systems, the root span’s duration may be significantly less than the duration of the trace. RPM The term RPM usually refers to the number of requests per minute your application receives from users. This is usually the same as CPM (calls per minute). Historically, some New Relic monitoring solutions, like APM and Browser Monitoring, used to contain RPM in the URL; for example, https://rpm.newrelic.com. This language use originally referred to Rails performance management because the first iteration of our product monitored Ruby on Rails applications. We monitor many more languages and systems than Ruby now. RUM (real user monitoring) See page load timing. runbook A runbook contains standard procedures and operations typically used by system administrators, network operations staff, and other personnel to handle outages, alert incidents, and other situations. If your organization stores runbook instructions as URLs, you can link this information to an alerts policy so your personnel has easy access to this information when an incident violates the defined policy thresholds. SAML (Security Assertion Markup Language) SAML is an XML-based data format for sharing authentication data between two parties. New Relic accounts must obtain a SAML certificate in order to enable Single Sign On for their users. For more information, see SAML service providers. Selenium Selenium is an open-source browser testing suite. Synthetics uses Selenium to test monitored websites with real browsers. For more information, see monitor types. service A service is a cluster of runtime server processes that accomplish a particular task, usually service requests. Unlike an application, a service is not usually invoked by a human. New Relic offers a variety of integrations that allow you to report data from your services. signal The stream of telemetry data that's watched and alerted on. You use NRQL queries to define a signal. signal filter When we receive data and it's routed to the streaming alerts platform, your NRQL WHERE clause will filter the data coming in. The filtered streaming data is what's evaluated for loss of signal violations, for example. span In a distributed trace, a span is a \"named, timed operation representing a contiguous segment of work in that trace\" (from OpenTracing.io definition). For distributed tracing, spans are displayed in the distributed tracing UI, and the data type Span is available to be queried. See also root span. SSL certificate SSL certificates encrypt data that is being transmitted. While New Relic refers to security certificates as SSL because it is a more commonly used term, all certificates adhere to industry standards for secure encryption in transit. SSO (single sign on) SSO (single sign on) allows you to manage user authentication in New Relic using an external SSO provider. For more information, see Setting up SSO. streaming algorithm This is what determines when the data in an aggregation window is processed. The streaming algorithm uses your server's clock time and the aggregation window size to trigger the alert evaluation process. sub-accounts See master account. Synthetic monitoring Synthetic monitoring allows you to monitor your website or API endpoint via automated, scriptable tools. Use free ping monitor to ensure your website is accessible, or expand your monitoring with browser monitors, which test your website with real browsers. Go further with scripting, to script browsers or API monitors for sophisticated testing. target A target is a resource or component monitored by a New Relic monitoring tool that has been identified in an alert condition. When the data source for that target crosses the defined critical threshold, we will open a violation. Depending on your policy's Incident preference setting, Alerts may create an incident record and send notifications through the defined channels. See also entity. tag Tags are key:value metadata added to monitored apps, hosts, dashboards, and other entities to help you organize your data at a high level. For details, see Tags. thresholds Thresholds are alert condition settings that define a violation. Threshold values include the value a data source must pass to trigger a violation and the time-related settings that define a violation; for example: Passing a certain value for at least x minutes Passing a certain value only once in x minutes While the data source passes a certain value, a degradation period starts. Likewise, when that data source stops passing a certain value, a recovery period starts. The durations of these two time periods are defined in the alert condition threshold settings. Thresholds have a required critical (red) threshold and an optional warning (yellow) threshold. In the UI, the entity's health status indicator will change to yellow or red when a threshold has been crossed and a violation will open. For more information, see Define thresholds. For an explanation of how thresholds relate to other basic Alerts concepts, see Concepts and workflow. throughput Throughput is a measurement of user activity for a monitored application. APM throughput and Browser Monitoring throughput are measured in different ways: APM: requests per minute (RPM) Browser: page views per minute (PPM) tier A tier can refer to how New Relic categorizes or visualizes the various agent language ecosystems that we support. For example: In APM, the color-coded categories that appear on your app's main Overview chart show response time spent in various functions, processes, or agents as tiers; for example, request queuing, garbage collection, Middleware, JVMs, etc. In New Relic labels, TIER can be used to define or classify the client-server architecture; for example, front-end and back-end tiers. \"Tier\" may sometimes be used to refer to our pricing editions. time picker By default the New Relic UI shows data for the past 30 minutes, ending now. To change the time window, use the time picker. time range A time range can refer to a length of time selected in the New Relic UI. New Relic displays a time range depending on the range you select using the time picker. timeslice data See metric timeslice data. trace A trace is a description of how a request travels through a system. Trace data helps you understand the performance of your system and diagnose problems. For more information on how we use trace data, see New Relic data types. traffic light See health status. transaction A transaction is defined as one logical unit of work in an application. This term primarily refers to server-side transactions monitored by APM. For more information, see documentation about web transactions and non-web transactions. The term transaction is also sometimes used in Browser Monitoring. In that case, it primarily refers to activity beginning with a browser-side web request and ending with a complete page load. transaction trace A transaction trace is a complete picture of a single transaction, down to the database queries and exact invocation patterns. With transaction traces, New Relic gives you much deeper visibility into a single slow transaction, which can help you understand a broader problem. For more information, see Transaction traces. UI The New Relic user interface. For more information, see Standard page functions. user A user can refer to a specific user role in a New Relic account. For more information, see Users. UTC Universal Time Coordinated (UTC), or Coordinated Universal Time, is a standard timestamp for synchronizing time around the world. value function (metrics) The numeric value obtained from metric timeslice data; for example, an average, minimum, maximum, total, sample size, etc. violation A violation occurs when the entity monitored by an alert condition reports a value that crosses the thresholds defined in that condition. For an explanation of how violations relate to other basic alerts concepts, see Concepts and workflow. You can view a summary of the violations for a selected incident's page. You can also view the violations for a specific entity from the product's UI. web external Web external is the term applied to the portion of time spent in transactions to external applications from within the code of the application you are monitoring. That time can be a call to a third party company (a payment provider, for example) or it could be a call to another microservice within your own company. Web external demonstrates how performance is impacted by your code executing outside the application you are measuring. web transaction A transaction is defined as one logical unit of work in an application. This term primarily refers to server-side transactions monitored by APM. Web transactions are initiated with an HTTP request. For most organizations, these represent customer-centric interactions and thus are the most important transactions to monitor. For more information, see Web transactions and Non-web transactions. WebDriverJS WebDriver is a Selenium component, used to control Synthetics scripted browsers. Specifically, Synthetics uses WebDriverJS, a Node.js-based flavor of Selenium. For more information, see Writing scripted browsers and Scripted browser examples. workload A workload represents a group of entities that work together to provide a digital service. For more information, see Workloads.",

Whether you have selected New Relic's US or EU region data center during setup of your New Relic account, when using New Relic CodeStream, you consent that your New Relic CodeStream data will get stored in the US. Regions and account hierarchy You can create accounts in each region. If your data is currently being hosted in the US region, you must create a new account to store data in the EU region. You cannot view EU data from a US account, or US data from an EU account. The data collected remains separate. The data cannot be aggregated or migrated between accounts. For organizations that have a parent/child account structure, you can only have one parent account. For more, see Manage apps or users with child accounts. For partnership accounts, no changes to the partnership owner account are required. However, data cannot be shared across regions, so a partnership requires a parent account for each region. Hierarchy example for partnership accounts With partnership accounts, a new parent account must be created for any data to be host in the EU region. This hierarchy illustrates how global accounts are structured with partnership owner accounts. Data is not aggregated beyond the parent account. Example hierarchy for partnership organizations. Because data cannot be shared across regions, a partnership will require a parent account for each region. Create an EU region account To create a New Relic account in the EU region: Go to the New Relic signup page. OR If you have a specific offer from a New Relic partner, follow that link directly. Follow the online steps to create your account. From the Select your region dropdown, select European Union. Agree to the Terms of Service. When you receive an email confirmation message, select the link to confirm your account and sign in to New Relic. Then install or update to the most recent agent version. API endpoints for EU region accounts If you have an EU region account, use the appropriate endpoints to access the following New Relic APIs: API EU endpoint Browser source maps API sourcemaps.service. eu .newrelic.com Copy Infrastructure Alert API infra-api. eu .newrelic.com Copy Dashboard API rpm. eu .newrelic.com/api/explore/dashboards/list Copy Insert API insights-collector. eu01 .nr-data.net Copy Insights Query API insights-api. eu .newrelic.com Copy Mobile apps rpm. eu .newrelic.com/mobile Copy NerdGraph GraphiQL API api. eu .newrelic.com/graphiql Copy Partner API The partner API is a global API with no regional data differences. Use this endpoint for both EU and US accounts: rpm.newrelic.com/api/v2/partners/ Copy REST API api. eu .newrelic.com Copy Synthetics API synthetics. eu .newrelic.com/synthetics/api Copy Trace API trace-api. eu .newrelic.com/trace/v1 Copy Metric API metric-api. eu .newrelic.com/metric/v1 Copy Log API log-api. eu .newrelic.com/log/v1 Copy Access New Relic One If your accounts report data to the EU data center, use the following link to go to New Relic One: one.eu.newrelic.com. Billing and pricing New Relic's account billing process and pricing options are the same for both the EU and US regions. Operational access and processing Customer Data is hosted in the region selected during account creation. Systems Operations Data is stored in the US region. All other information, including account information (such as license subscription information, billing, and internal monitoring) is hosted in the US region and replicated in the EU region. New Relic may access and process Customer Data in the United States and such other jurisdictions where New Relic has affiliates and subsidiaries, including as may be necessary to maintain, secure, or perform the services, to provide technical support, or as necessary to comply with law or a binding order of a government body. Customer Data from existing New Relic accounts cannot be transferred or shared across regions, and new data generated cannot be shared with existing accounts, even in partnership accounts. Verify your account is based in EU region Use either of these options to verify whether your account data is hosted in the EU region's data center: In APM, mouse over the application name to view the URL. If it begins with rpm.eu.newrelic.com/, it is an EU-based account. Check your New Relic license key. If it begins with EU, it is an EU-based account.",

      "body": "BETA FEATURE This feature is currently in beta. What permissions do I need to use New Relic's Service Levels? To use New Relic's Service Levels and see SLO results, you need a full platform user. However, in order to create new SLIs and SLOs, you need the specific capability in your role to modify events to metric rules. If you get the following errors, check your user permissions: The UI has disabled the option to save an SLI/SLO. The API returns the error message “Cannot query field \\\"eventExportRegisterRule\\\" on type \\\"RootMutationType\\\".”. How do I get support from New Relic during the public beta? Service Levels Management is in public beta, and no official support is offered yet through the Support portal. If you have general questions and feedback, please post them on the Explorers Hub. New Relic’s community and the product team will be glad to help you there. If you have suggestions about documentation, please suggest an improvement or send your contribution using the Create issue or Edit page buttons on the top right corner in the docs UI. Why don’t I see any data right after I create an SLI? New Relic starts generating new SLI metrics from the moment that you create an SLI. This is why we need a few minutes before we can start showing the first meaningful SLI attainment results. The benefit of the new data is that it has 13 month retention by default, and it’s more efficient to query for long periods of time. Can I configure an SLI on any entity type? Yes, you can configure an SLI on any entity type, such as an APM service, a browser application, or a Lambda function. SLI queries support NRDB events. Support for dimensional metrics on SLI queries is on our roadmap. Can I get alerts on SLI data? Alerts on New Relic's Service Levels are on our roadmap. How does New Relic calculate the remaining error budget? The remaining error budget indicates what percentage of requests could still have a bad response over the SLO period without compromising the objective. Therefore, the total amount of tolerated bad responses will vary with the throughput of requests. Time-based error budgets are on our roadmap.",

      "body": "BETA FEATURE This feature is currently in beta. With New Relic you can define and consume service level indicators and service level objectives for your applications. What are SLIs and SLOs? Service Levels are used to measure the performance of a service from the end user (or client application) point of view. For instance, a Service Level can represent whether a video loaded quickly enough, or whether a directions service returned at least one possible route between two points. Service level indicators (SLIs) are accurate quantitative measures of the user experience as described by a service level. They represent a proportion of successful outputs, and therefore they’re expressed as a percentage (%). For example, an SLI can measure the proportion of requests that were faster than some threshold, or the proportion of records coming into a pipeline that resulted in the correct value coming out. And while users understand that a video might take a few additional seconds to load, or that an application might return an error from time to time, this shouldn’t happen often if you don’t want to lose their trust. Therefore, once you’ve defined SLIs for the performance aspects that are most relevant for the end users of your services, you need to set SLOs to track that the service is meeting their expectations. Service level objectives (SLOs) are defined as a target value that an SLI must meet over a period of time. For example, videos must start playing in less than 2 seconds 99% of the time over a week period. Please refer to the Service Level management use case implementation guide to learn more about identifying service boundaries and deploying the instrumentation that your service levels will be based on. Service Levels and APM SLA reports New Relic has provided automatic SLA Reports for APM Services for a long time. The Apdex-based reports, which you can get on your email inbox on Mondays, are automatically generated for services that produce web transactions, and are useful to see trends over time. On top of the SLAs, our new SLM level capability is better aligned with modern service level best practices, such as those promoted by the Google SRE Handbook, and provides new, improved functionality: SLIs can be defined on any NRDB event that is reported to New Relic, not just APM transactions. Therefore you can also base SLIs on your own custom events. You can decide which service boundaries and which metrics are relevant for your service levels, and you can set your own objectives. You can view SLO results across your accounts, and within your workloads. What's next? Ready to get started? If you don't already have one, sign up for a free New Relic account. You can find Service Levels in several places in New Relic One: At the top nav bar, under the More menu (which you can customize). At the previews of those entities that have an SLI defined. In APM services, at the reports section. Within a workload, at the Service Levels tab. Carry on and read our docs on how to create and consume SLIs and SLOs. You can also check out how to manage SLMs with our API.",

Our guided install creates a customized CLI command for your environment that downloads and installs the New Relic CLI and the infrastructure agent. Ready to get started? Click the Guided install button. Or, if your account reports data through our EU data center, click EU Guided install. Guided install EU Guided install Our infrastructure agent discovers the applications and infrastructure and log sources running in your environment, and recommends which ones should be instrumented. The install automates the configuration and deployment of each system you choose to instrument. Why it matters With our guided install, you can instrument your applications and infrastructure and start seeing your data in New Relic in minutes. The guided install uses our command line interface (CLI), the infrastructure agent for your host environment, and a library of installation recipes to instrument your applications and infrastructure for you. That means less toil for you. Because our instrumentation recipes are open source, you can modify existing recipes, or build new ones, to suit your needs. Some technical detail The New Relic guided install uses open source installation recipes to instrument on-host integrations. These recipes include installation and setup commands, information about logs, and metadata related to what’s being installed. They're collected in a YAML file for each type of system and have all of the installation details necessary to install the infrastructure agent for a specific integration. Important On Windows, our guided install only supports Microsoft SQL Server, logs, and the infrastructure agent. All other integrations are only supported on Linux. On-host integration (OHI) recipes The guided install automates the discovery, configuration, and installation of OHIs. However, there may be times when you want to instrument them one-by-one using the CLI install command. To install any individual on-host integration, run this command: curl -Ls https://raw.githubusercontent.com/newrelic/newrelic-cli/master/scripts/install.sh | bash && sudo NEW_RELIC_API_KEY=API_KEY NEW_RELIC_ACCOUNT_ID=ACCOUNT_ID /usr/local/bin/newrelic install -n INTEGRATION-FLAG Copy For example: curl -Ls https://raw.githubusercontent.com/newrelic/newrelic-cli/master/scripts/install.sh | bash && sudo NEW_RELIC_API_KEY=<API_KEY> NEW_RELIC_ACCOUNT_ID=<ACCOUNT_ID> /usr/local/bin/newrelic install -n apache-open-source-integration Copy The table lists the integrations supported by the guided install CLI command. The specific on-host integration commands are provided for your reference. Our open source integrations send performance metrics and inventory data from your servers and applications to the New Relic platform. You can view pre-built dashboards of your metric data, create alert policies, and create your own custom queries and charts.

MySQL: Incorrect user permissions To monitor MySQL health data, you need a valid username and password with specific permissions. These commands will create a user and grant the required permissions: Create a user newrelic@localhost with a specific password. sudo mysql -e \"CREATE USER 'newrelic'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY 'YOUR_SELECTED_PASSWORD';\" Copy Give replication privileges to newrelic@localhost with a maximum of 5 connections. sudo mysql -e \"GRANT REPLICATION CLIENT ON *.* TO 'newrelic'@'localhost' WITH MAX_USER_CONNECTIONS 5;\" Copy Give select privileges to newrelic@localhost with a maximum of 5 connections. sudo mysql -e \"GRANT SELECT ON *.* TO 'newrelic'@'localhost' WITH MAX_USER_CONNECTIONS 5;\" Copy Once done, your next guided install attempt should work. NGINX: No status URL To monitor your NGINX server, you'll need to configure a valid status URL. status_url: The URL set up to provide the metrics using the status module. If the default value of 127.0.0.1 is incorrect, substitute the address/FQDN/URL for your system. Example: status_url: http://127.0.0.1/status You can read more about the status_url in these NGINX docs: For NGINX Open Source: HTTP stub status module For NGINX Plus: HTTP status module and HTTP API module There are different ways to set status_url, depending on how NGINX was installed: If enabled via Kubernetes: See Monitor services running on Kubernetes.

      "body": "New Relic's global data hosting structure consists of two regions: the European Union (EU) region and the United States (US) region. Selecting your preferred region during the account setup process allows you to specify the region where your performance monitoring data will be hosted. You can also create accounts in each region. Requirements Access to the New Relic EU region requires the latest agent version. For new customers: Install the most recent agent version. For existing customers: Update to the most recent agent version. Minimum agent version required: C SDK 1.0.0 or higher Go 2.0.0 or higher Java 4.0.0 or higher .NET 8.0.0 or higher Node.js 3.0.0 or higher PHP 8.0.0.204 or higher Python 3.0.0.89 or higher Ruby 5.0.0.342 or higher Regions and availability Your choice of data center is not limited by your geographic location. You can choose to create an account with data hosted in either the EU or US region, regardless of where you or your systems reside. You can also create accounts in each region. New Relic offers almost all the same active products, features, support offerings, and performance levels in the EU region as what is offered in the US region. Exceptions: The following are not supported with an EU region account: Infinite Tracing is not available. APM's weekly performance reports are not available. Errors inbox is not available. Log patterns Deprecated products and features are not available. New Relic's Incident Intelligence service operates solely in the US whether you store your data in New Relic’s US region data center or New Relic’s EU region data center, by using New Relic Incident Intelligence, you consent that New Relic may move and store your data in the US region. New Relic CodeStream operates solely in the US. Whether you have selected New Relic's US or EU region data center during setup of your New Relic account, when using New Relic CodeStream, you consent that your New Relic CodeStream data will get stored in the US. Regions and account hierarchy You can create accounts in each region. If your data is currently being hosted in the US region, you must create a new account to store data in the EU region. You cannot view EU data from a US account, or US data from an EU account. The data collected remains separate. The data cannot be aggregated or migrated between accounts. For organizations that have a parent/child account structure, you can only have one parent account. For more, see Manage apps or users with child accounts. For partnership accounts, no changes to the partnership owner account are required. However, data cannot be shared across regions, so a partnership requires a parent account for each region. Hierarchy example for partnership accounts With partnership accounts, a new parent account must be created for any data to be host in the EU region. This hierarchy illustrates how global accounts are structured with partnership owner accounts. Data is not aggregated beyond the parent account. Example hierarchy for partnership organizations. Because data cannot be shared across regions, a partnership will require a parent account for each region. Create an EU region account To create a New Relic account in the EU region: Go to the New Relic signup page. OR If you have a specific offer from a New Relic partner, follow that link directly. Follow the online steps to create your account. From the Select your region dropdown, select European Union. Agree to the Terms of Service. When you receive an email confirmation message, select the link to confirm your account and sign in to New Relic. Then install or update to the most recent agent version. API endpoints for EU region accounts If you have an EU region account, use the appropriate endpoints to access the following New Relic APIs: API EU endpoint Browser source maps API sourcemaps.service. eu .newrelic.com Copy Infrastructure Alert API infra-api. eu .newrelic.com Copy Dashboard API rpm. eu .newrelic.com/api/explore/dashboards/list Copy Insert API insights-collector. eu01 .nr-data.net Copy Insights Query API insights-api. eu .newrelic.com Copy Mobile apps rpm. eu .newrelic.com/mobile Copy NerdGraph GraphiQL API api. eu .newrelic.com/graphiql Copy Partner API The partner API is a global API with no regional data differences. Use this endpoint for both EU and US accounts: rpm.newrelic.com/api/v2/partners/ Copy REST API api. eu .newrelic.com Copy Synthetics API synthetics. eu .newrelic.com/synthetics/api Copy Trace API trace-api. eu .newrelic.com/trace/v1 Copy Metric API metric-api. eu .newrelic.com/metric/v1 Copy Log API log-api. eu .newrelic.com/log/v1 Copy Access New Relic One If your accounts report data to the EU data center, use the following link to go to New Relic One: one.eu.newrelic.com. Billing and pricing New Relic's account billing process and pricing options are the same for both the EU and US regions. Operational access and processing Customer Data is hosted in the region selected during account creation. Systems Operations Data is stored in the US region. All other information, including account information (such as license subscription information, billing, and internal monitoring) is hosted in the US region and replicated in the EU region. New Relic may access and process Customer Data in the United States and such other jurisdictions where New Relic has affiliates and subsidiaries, including as may be necessary to maintain, secure, or perform the services, to provide technical support, or as necessary to comply with law or a binding order of a government body. Customer Data from existing New Relic accounts cannot be transferred or shared across regions, and new data generated cannot be shared with existing accounts, even in partnership accounts. Verify your account is based in EU region Use either of these options to verify whether your account data is hosted in the EU region's data center: In APM, mouse over the application name to view the URL. If it begins with rpm.eu.newrelic.com/, it is an EU-based account. Check your New Relic license key. If it begins with EU, it is an EU-based account.",

      "body": "A glossary of common terminology you may encounter. account dropdown In the upper right of the New Relic UI, the account dropdown gives you access to your account settings. If you're trying to switch between accounts, use the account switcher. account switcher If you have access to more than one account in a multi-account organization, you can use the account switcher to switch between accounts. This is located in the top right of most New Relic UI pages. For more on factors that affect access to accounts, see Factors affecting access. To find account settings, use the account dropdown. administrator A type of user role on a New Relic account. For more information, see Users. agent At New Relic, an agent is a piece of monitoring software that provides integrations with various technologies (for example, web frameworks, host operating systems, or database types). The agents send that data to New Relic, usually on a specific cadence. For more information, see: New Relic Instant Observability Install agents agent API Some New Relic agents have agent APIs that allow you to extend the functionality of an agent. You can use the API to control, customize and extend the functionality of the agent. Here are some agent API docs: APM agents: C SDK API Go agent API Java agent API .NET agent API Node.js agent API PHP agent API Ruby agent API Python agent API Browser agent: Browser agent API Mobile agents: iOS SDK API Android SDK API aggregated metrics Aggregated metric data summarizes calls to specific methods in your application, including how many times each one was called and response times. In the New Relic UI, you see the class and method names along with their aggregate numbers. Metric data aggregation depends on the New Relic tool and your subscription level. For more information, see the documentation about data retention. aggregation delay The length of time in seconds to wait for the aggregation window to fill with data. Required when using CADENCE or EVENT_FLOW aggreation_method types. aggregation function You can use NRQL query functions, such as sum(), average(), or latest() to choose how the data points in an aggregation window should be processed into a single data point. The single aggregated data point is what's passed through the alert evaluation process. aggregation method New Relic aggregates data into windows, and needs to determine when the current window ends and the next one begins. The aggregation_method is the logic that tells us when we have all the data for a given aggregation window. Once the window is closed, the data is aggregated into a single point and evaluated against the threshold. This field is optional. One of the following three values can be specified: EVENT_FLOW: (Default) Each aggregation window will wait until it starts to see timestamps arrive that are past its own delay setting. Once this occurs, the data is published. Relies on the timestamps of arriving data, so wall-clock time is no longer relevant. Works best for sources that come in frequently and with low event spread (high througput metrics) CADENCE: Classic New Relic logic where each evaluation window waits exactly as long as the aggregation_delay setting, using the wall-clock time as a timer. aggregation_delay is required when using this option. Data arriving too late will be dropped, which can cause false alerts. EVENT_TIMER: Each aggregation window has a timer on it, set to the aggregation_timer setting. The Timer starts running as soon as the first data point appears for that aggregation window (based on the data point’s timestamp). The aggregation_timer is reset for each new data point that arrives for that window. Once the aggregation_timer reaches 0, the aggregation window is published. Ideal for sparse and batched data, such as cloud integrations and infrequent error logs. aggregation timer The length of time in seconds to wait after each data point received, to ensure the entire batch is processed. Required when using EVENT_TIMER aggregation_method type. aggregation window Streaming alerts gathers data together into specific amounts of time. These windows of time are customizable. Data points are collected together based their timestamps and reported as a batch. The customizable aggregation window provides greater flexibility and fewer false violations when alerting on irregular or less frequent data points. alert An alert communicates an event or incident that designated personnel can track through Alerts. For an explanation of how basic alerts concepts are related, see Concepts and workflow. alert condition An alert condition (or condition), identified by its unique numeric condition_id, contains the criteria for creating a violation. The condition includes the threshold that is set for a metric timeslice or a custom metric over time on a chosen target. For an explanation of how a condition relates to other basic alerts concepts, see Concepts and workflow. alert evaluation Streaming data is assessed on a set of aggregation windows to determine if an alert condition is violating or recovering. The aggregation window time is how long we'll collect data before running the NRQL query condition. The offset evaluation time is how long you want us to wait for late data before assessing it. If a window doesn't have any data points, it's treated as a gap for loss of signal. alert policy A collection of one or more conditions, one or more notification channels, and an Incident preference setting. If a condition contained within the policy opens a violation, an incident may be opened depending on the Incident preference setting. Notifications will then be sent to all channels attached to the policy. For an explanation of how a policy relates to other basic alerts concepts, see Concepts and workflow. apdex Apdex is an industry-standard way to measure users' satisfaction with the response time of an application or service. New Relic rates each response as Satisfied, Tolerated, or Frustrated, and uses these ratings to calculate an overall user satisfaction score. For more information, see Apdex: Measure user satisfaction. apdex_f The response time above which a transaction are rated frustrating. Defaults to four times apdex_t. Requests that complete in less than apdex_t are rated satisfied. Requests that take longer than apdex_t, but less than four times apdex_t (apdex_f), are tolerated. Any requests that take longer than apdex_f are rated frustrating. For more information, see Apdex: Measure user satisfaction. apdex_t The response time above which a transaction is considered tolerable. The default value is 0.5 seconds, but you can change this in your Apdex settings. Requests that complete in less than apdex_t are rated satisfied. Requests that take more than apdex_t, but less than apdex_f, are tolerated. Any requests that take longer than apdex_f are rated frustrating. For more information, see Apdex: Measure user satisfaction. API (application programming interface) New Relic offers a variety of APIs and SDKs. For more information, see the introduction to New Relic's APIs. APM New Relic's APM (application performance monitoring) provides monitoring of your web or non-web application's performance. APM supports apps using several programming languages. application For New Relic purposes, any program instrumented by New Relic. application ID Some New Relic solutions assign a monitored application a unique application ID, often shortened to app ID. When present, this ID is available in the UI. It is also reported as an attribute and can be queried. For how to determine this, see Find app ID. application name The name that New Relic combines with your license key to uniquely identify a particular app. For more information, see Name your application. Applied Intelligence (AI) Applied Intelligence (AI) helps you find, troubleshoot, and resolve problems more quickly. Specifically, it’s a hybrid machine learning engine that reduces alert noise, correlates incidents, and automatically detects anomalies. Applied Intelligence includes Alerts, Incident Intelligence, and Proactive Detection. attribute Attributes are key-value pairs attached to data objects reported to New Relic. Attributes add detail, and they're similar to tags or labels in other SaaS software. You can explore this data by querying or searching via the UI or by using the data dictionary. Examples: APM reports a Transaction event. This includes timing data for the transaction in a duration attribute, which might have a value of .002. Our Infrastructure Monitoring reports a ProcessSample event. This includes a variety of CPU usage attributes, including a cpuSystemPercent attribute, which might have a value of .01. Our Telemetry SDK reports a Metric data type for storing metrics, with attached attributes like metricName and newrelic.source. Some New Relic tools allow you to report custom attributes to enhance your monitoring. For more information about attributes in APM, see Agent attributes. availability monitoring See Types of Synthetics monitors. browser The New Relic UI supports most browsers. For more information, see Supported browsers. For our end-user browser monitoring tool, see Browser Monitoring. Browser monitoring A Real User Monitoring (RUM) solution that measures the speed and performance of your end users as they navigate to your site from different web browsers, devices, operating systems, and networks. background external See web external. child account See parent account. cloud-based integration New Relic offers cloud-based integrations with providers such as Amazon Web Services (AWS), Microsoft Azure, and Google Cloud Platform. collector The component that collects data from New Relic agents running on an app server, mobile device, or end-user browser. While the agent is installed on a user's app server, the collectors are centrally located in New Relic's data center. In order to contact the collector, the agent must be able to reach New Relic's domains and IP addresses. (The exact domain or IP depends on the New Relic monitoring tool.) The collector receives and interprets this data, and stores it in a database. The data is then retrieved and presented in the New Relic UI and by our various REST APIs. Command line interface (CLI) Our command line interface (CLI) is a tool you can use to build a New Relic application. This is the same tool our own engineers use. Go here for quick start instructions. Go to our Developer site for sample apps and guides. compute unit (CU) A unit of measurement that determines your pricing for some New Relic products governed by our original product-based pricing model. For more information, see Compute unit pricing. condition_id See alert condition. CPM (calls per minute) The number of calls your application receives each minute. This usually corresponds to the number of page views or external connections, and is usually the same as RPM (requests per minute). CPU burn The time consumed by code minus the wait time for a transaction. This is the time actually spent processing the transaction. It appears in the New Relic UI at the top of the transaction view for the agents that provide it (Ruby and PHP only). custom attribute A key-value pair added to a transaction or event in order to gain additional information about it. For more information, see custom attributes. custom dashboard A customizable dashboard with charts and tables that includes data from multiple New Relic data sources. For more information, see dashboards. custom event An event, in New Relic terms, is a data object with attached attributes. New Relic reports default event types, like Transaction and TransactionError. You can also create your own events. Events can be queried, and are used in some other features. You can generate custom events with APM agents, the browser monitoring agent, the mobile monitoring agents, and via the Event API. Alternatively, you can add custom attributes to some existing default New Relic events. custom instrumentation Custom instrumentation allows you to extend New Relic's monitoring to instrument code elements New Relic doesn't automatically instrument. Custom instrumentation is useful when your framework is not supported by New Relic, or when New Relic fails to pick up some element of your program. You can also use custom instrumentation to block a transaction from being reported entirely. For more information, see Custom instrumentation. custom metric Metric timeslice data that is manually recorded via an API call. Custom metrics allow you to record arbitrary metrics; for example, timing or computer resource data. All custom metric names must be prefixed with Custom/. For more information, see Custom metrics. Not to be confused with custom instrumentation data. data collector See collector. data explorer Use the data explorer to access, query and customize your data, create visualizations, and make connections between your services in a consistent and curated experience. For more on using the data explorer, see Introduction to the data explorer. degradation period When a data source enters a violating state, a degradation period of time begins. The degradation period is set in the condition's threshold. A violation will open if the source stays in a violating state for the entire degradation period. In addition: If the data source enters a non-violating state before the entire time has elapsed, the degradation period countdown is reset, and a violation does not open. If your alert condition threshold is configured as at least once in, the degradation period always lasts a single minute. dimensional metric A dimensional metric is a metric that has multiple attributes, also known as dimensions. At New Relic, we report dimensional metrics using the Metric data type. For more on other metric data types, see Metric data. Docker An open platform for distributed applications, which allows you to assemble multi-container portable apps. Infrastructure Monitoring includes integrated Docker monitoring. For more information about Docker, see the Docker website. downtime The period of time when customers cannot access your site and your app is not reporting to New Relic. For more information, see Synthetic Monitoring and Types of synthetic monitors. entity In New Relic, an entity is anything we can identify that has data you can monitor. An entity can be something you monitor directly, like applications and microservices, or indirectly, like data centers. You can identify one or more entities to be targets for alert conditions. In the Alerts API, the entity being monitored is identified with an entity_id. For more on this, see What are entities? event The word event is a general term that can have many meanings. At New Relic, event can have several meanings: At New Relic, event data is one of our core data types. Event data represents a record of a single event at a particular moment in time. Events can vary by type (for example, Transaction or Mobile, and will have associated attributes (for example, timestamp or transactionName). For more details, see Event data. For our infrastructure monitoring, the word event can be used to refer to important system and host activity. For example, a configuration change for a monitored host would be registered on Infrastructure's Events UI page. For alerts, the Events UI page displays a list of alerts-related incidents for your monitored entities. Events are reported for a violation opening and for closing. In some contexts, event can refer to any NRQL-queryable data type. For example, when you run a NRQL query, you will see a count of inspected events: this refers to a count of all data types queried. expected error An expected error is a common error that you don't want to affect your Apdex score or error rate. For more information, see Manage errors in APM. exporter At New Relic, an exporter is a type of integration that reports telemetry data to New Relic from a third-party (non-New Relic) telemetry tool. For examples, see Exporters, or search our integration quickstarts in New Relic I/O. Flex New Relic Flex is an application-agnostic, all-in-one infrastructure integration. With it, you can build your own integration that collects metric data from a wide variety of services, and that can instrument any app that exposes metrics over a standard protocol (HTTP, file, shell) in a standard format (for example, JSON or plain text) to the terminal. It's a recommended way to create a custom integration, because it doesn't require coding skills. framework A framework is a structured collection of pre-defined functions, into which an application builder inserts their own code to build their application. A framework is not the same as a library. While a library is a collection of functions you can call as needed, a framework is a skeleton for your application. The functions in that framework then call your functions. For more about the distinction between a framework and a library, see What is the difference between a framework and a library?. New Relic automatically instruments many common frameworks. For more about the frameworks New Relic supports, see the agent-specific documentation: C SDK supported frameworks Go supported frameworks Java supported frameworks .NET supported frameworks Node.js supported frameworks PHP supported frameworks Python supported frameworks Ruby supported frameworks harvest cycle The period of time between each connection from a New Relic agent to the collector. Between harvest cycles, an agent collects and caches data. At the end of the cycle an agent reports those data to the collector, then begins a new harvest cycle. health status indicator Some New Relic UI pages have a health status indicator appearing next to an index of monitored entities. This is a colored bar (generally green, yellow, red, or gray) indicating the status of your app or other entity monitored by New Relic. It also indicates whether the entity has any alert policies assigned to it and whether there are any policy violations. In general, the colored bar will be green, yellow, red, or gray to indicate the health status. Exceptions: Our REST API (v2) uses orange instead of yellow for the application's health and reporting status. Service maps use different criteria for reporting the health of a connection between an app and an external service not monitored by New Relic (for example, a third party API). host At New Relic, a host means one of the following: A physical machine is a hardware-based device with dedicated physical resources, including memory, processing, and storage. Each machine has its own OS which applications run on. A virtual machine (VM) is the software implementation of a physical machine that executes programs like a physical machine. One or more virtual machines can run on a physical machine. Each virtual machine has its own OS and allocated virtual machine resources such as RAM and CPU. A cloud instance is a type of virtual machine that is run in the public cloud. In this context, virtual machines and cloud instances are different from Java Virtual Machines (JVMs) and containers. host ID Each host identified by APM is assigned a host ID. This ID is used to uniquely identify it, and to retrieve data about that host via the REST API. For more information, see List host ID. ignored error An error that you have told the APM agent not to report to the collector. For more information, see Manage errors in APM. incident An incident is a collection of one or more violations of the conditions defined in an alert policy. An incident record includes all of the open and close time stamps for each violation, as well as chart snapshots of the data being evaluated around the time of each violation. You can view detailed information from the Incidents pages in the user interface. You can also select your preference for how we roll up violations into the incident. For an explanation of how an incident relates to other basic alerts concepts, see Concepts and workflow. Infrastructure monitoring By connecting changes in host performance to changes in your configuration, infrastructure monitoring provides real-time metrics and powerful analytics that reduce your mean-time-to-resolution (MTTR). Infrastructure is specifically designed for complex environments that need flexible, dynamic server monitoring, from a physical datacenter to thousands of Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) instances and other types of integrations. Insights Insights was the name for the New Relic product that previously governed the reporting of custom events, as well as the ability to query and chart your New Relic data. These features are now a fundamental part of the New Relic One platform and are no longer governed by the Insights product or name. To learn more about these features: Event API for reporting custom events Query and chart data For historical reasons, the word \"Insights\" is still used in some places. For example: Some APM agents still have Insights language in their codebase. For example, the Java agent custom_insights_events configuration. For New Relic organizations on our original pricing model, Insights Pro is still the product name governing custom event data ingest and retention. There is an API key called the Insights insert key. instance ID Each instance identified by New Relic is assigned a unique instance ID. Instance IDs are most commonly found for JVMs (Java Virtual Machines), but can exist for each agent. This ID is used to uniquely identify it, and to retrieve data about that instance via the REST API. For more information, see List instance IDs. instrumentation The collection of data from an application or host. When New Relic instruments a framework, it detects the methods and calls used by that framework, and intelligently groups them together. integration At New Relic, an integration refers to a solution that integrates with a specific technology (like a web framework or a type of database). All our integrations can be found as quickstarts in New Relic Instant Observability. interaction In our mobile monitoring, an interaction is a specific code path initiated by a user interaction (usually a button press). An interaction is the mobile equivalent of a transaction, and like a transaction an interaction can be traced and monitored. You can see much of the data included in an interaction in the BrowserInteraction event. interaction trace An interaction trace is a complete picture of a single interaction. With interaction traces, New Relic gives you much deeper visibility into a single slow interaction, which can help you understand a broader problem. Interaction traces are the mobile equivalent of a transaction trace. For more information, see Creating interactions (iOS) and Creating interactions (Android). inventory data Inventory data is information about the status or configuration of a service or host. Examples of inventory data include: Configuration settings Name of the host the service is on Amazon AWS region Port being used For more information, see Understand and use data. key transaction A web transaction that the user has marked as particularly important; for example, key business events (such as signups or purchase confirmations), or transactions with a high performance impact (such as searches). Key transactions have their own pages in the UI and other customized values. For more information, see Key transactions. launcher A launcher is a specific piece of code you can include when you create a New Relic One app. It creates the tile on the homepage that you click to launch the app. For more information, see the documentation about core UI components. log A log is a message about a system used to understand the activity of the system and to diagnose problems. For more information on how we use log data, see Log management. Log monitoring Our log management and monitoring features give you the tools to collect, process, explore, visualize, and alert on your log data using your existing log forwarder. With all of your log data in one place, you'll be able to make better decisions, detect and resolve problems more quickly, and see your logs in context to troubleshoot faster. Logs Our Logs feature is a scalable log management platform that allows you to connect your log data with the rest of your telemetry data. Pre-built plugins with some of the most common open-source logging tools make it simple to send your data from anywhere to New Relic. Logs in context Logs in context makes it easy to link to your log data with related data across the rest of our platform. Bringing all of this data together in a single tool allows you to quickly get to the root cause of an issue and find the log lines that you need to identify and resolve a problem. master account See parent account. metric A metric is a numeric measurement. Metric data is a broad category because there are several ways to make and report measurements. For more about how metrics are reported at New Relic, see New Relic data types. metric timeslice New Relic reports metrics in several ways. One variety of metric data is called metric timeslice data; this is the type of data used to generate many of the charts in APM, mobile monitoring, and browser monitoring (for more details, see metric timeslice data). Over time, metric timeslice data is aggregated into longer timeslice data records for more efficient storage. For more about how we aggregate this type of data, see Data aggregation. For how to query this type of data, see Query metric timeslice data. metric grouping issue A metric grouping issue occurs when an account sends too many differently named metric timeslice data points to New Relic, and those individual web transactions are not properly aggregated. For example, rather than a single /user/controlpanel/ metric name, you might see /user/controlpanel/alice, /user/controlpanel/bob, and /user/controlpanel/carol. For more information, see Metric grouping issues. minion The software that accepts monitor jobs from a private location. A minion is a packaged virtual appliance that runs in your hypervisor. For more information, see Private locations overview and install and configure private minions. Mobile monitoring Mobile monitoring allows you to monitor and manage the performance of your mobile apps on Android, iOS, tvOS, and other systems. Mobile monitoring provides end-to-end details, including crashes, throughput, HTTP requests, error traces, and more. Not to be confused with New Relic's own mobile apps for Android, iPhone, and iPad. monitor For our Synthetic Monitoring, a monitor ensures your website or API endpoint is available. For more information, see Adding and editing monitors. NerdGraph NerdGraph is our GraphQL API, an efficient and flexible query language that lets you request exactly the data you need, without over-fetching or under-fetching. NerdGraph calls get all the data you need in a single request. NerdGraph also makes it easier to evolve APIs over time and enables powerful developer tools. You can use our NerdGraph GraphiQL explorer to explore the schema and find definitions. With valid New Relic API key, you can try it out yourself at api.newrelic.com/graphiql. Nerdlet A Nerdlet is a component of a New Relic One application. It's a specific UI view, represented by a React JavaScript package. For more information, see Nerdpack file structure. Nerdpack A Nerdpack is a component of a New Relic One application. It's the package containing all the files needed by that application. For more information, see Nerdpack file structure. New Relic Edge with Infinite Tracing New Relic Edge with Infinite Tracing is a fully managed, distributed tracing service that observes 100% of your application traces, then provides actionable data so you can solve issues faster. For more information, see /docs/understand-dependencies/distributed-tracing/get-started/how-new-relic-distributed-tracing-works. New Relic One For more information, see Introduction to New Relic One. New Relic One catalog Our catalog is a collection of applications built on the New Relic One platform. The catalog includes custom apps we've built, public open source apps, and any apps that you buid. You can browse the catalog on New Relic One. NRQL (New Relic query language) NRQL is a query language, similar in form to SQL, that allows you to query the data stored in your New Relic account. non-web transaction APM identifies transactions as either web or non-web. When New Relic does not detect a transaction was initiated by a web request, this is called a non-web transaction. For more information, see Background processes and other non-web transactions. notification The message sent when an incident opens, is acknowledged, or closes. The type of notification is defined by the alert policy's notification channel. For an explanation of how notifications relate to other basic alerts concepts, see Concepts and workflow. notification channel Where we send a notification when an incident opens, is acknowledged, or closes. Available channels include email, mobile push notifications, webhooks, and more. on-host integration On-host integrations refer to integrations that reside on your own servers or hosts and that communicate with our infrastructure agent. For more information, see Introduction to on-host integrations. owner For accounts on our original pricing model, this is a type of user role: the user who initially created the account. For more information, see Users. page load timing With page load timing, New Relic monitors the full load time for end-user browsers. New Relic's application agents dynamically inject JavaScript into the page, then capture the following key load points: Navigation start: The user initiates the transaction. First byte: The browser receives the requested page. DOM ready: The browser has finished parsing DOM. Page ready: Page loading is complete. Page load timing is sometimes referred to as RUM, or real user monitoring. Unlike standard RUM, page load timing also captures JavaScript errors and AJAX requests. For more information, see Page load timing process. parameter Deprecated term; see attribute. parent account New Relic organizations can have a parent/child account structure. This structure was much more important for organizations on our original user model, but is still used for some features for organizations on the New Relic One user model. Learn more about account structure. Parent accounts were previously referred to as \"master accounts\", and child accounts were previously referred to as \"sub-accounts\". permalink A unique URL that links to a view of your application at a specific point in time. Permalinks are useful for troubleshooting and for sharing interesting time windows with colleagues. pinger The component of New Relic that connects to your website to verify your website is accessible. New Relic has pingers in Europe, Asia, and the United States. Each pinger attempts to contact your website at least once every two minutes. If enough pingers are unable to reach your website, your application will be considered down. For in-depth scriptable testing, including real browser tests and tests of API endpoints, see Synthetic Monitoring. Synthetic Monitoring includes free ping monitoring, which allows you to monitor your website from locations around the world. For more information, see Types of Synthetic monitors. polling interval (AWS) Our Amazon integrations query your AWS services according to a polling interval, which varies depending on the integration. Each polling interval occurs for every AWS entity. For example, if you have thirteen Elastic Load Balancers (ELB), each one will be polled every five minutes. Depending on the AWS integration, there may be delays in the timing between the API request and the metric data returned. If you notice unusual delays, follow the integration troubleshooting procedures. PPM (pages per minute) The number of pages per minute your application serves. private location A Synthetic monitor feature that allows you to run Synthetic monitors from within your own systems by creating private minions. Private locations allow you to extend your Synthetic coverage to new geographical locations, and to monitor websites behind your firewall such as an intranet site. For more information, see Private locations overview. recovery period A recovery period of time begins when a data source enters a non-violating state after being in a violating state. The recovery period is set in the condition's threshold. A violation will close when a source remains in a non-violating state and the recovery period time has elapsed. If the data source enters a violating state before the time has elapsed, the recovery period clock will reset and the violation won't close. response time The duration of time between a request for service and a response. For more information, see Response time. restricted user A type of user role on a New Relic account. For more information, see Users. rollup Using the same application name for multiple applications. This allows you to combine data in APM, either from multiple applications, or from multiple instances of an application. For more information, see Rolling up app data. root span For distributed tracing, the root span is the first span in a trace. In many cases, the root span duration will represent the duration of the entire trace, or be very close to it. However, for more complex, modern systems that use a lot of asynchronous, non-blocking processes, this will not be true. For those systems, the root span’s duration may be significantly less than the duration of the trace. RPM The term RPM usually refers to the number of requests per minute your application receives from users. This is usually the same as CPM (calls per minute). Historically, some New Relic monitoring solutions, like APM and Browser Monitoring, used to contain RPM in the URL; for example, https://rpm.newrelic.com. This language use originally referred to Rails performance management because the first iteration of our product monitored Ruby on Rails applications. We monitor many more languages and systems than Ruby now. RUM (real user monitoring) See page load timing. runbook A runbook contains standard procedures and operations typically used by system administrators, network operations staff, and other personnel to handle outages, alert incidents, and other situations. If your organization stores runbook instructions as URLs, you can link this information to an alerts policy so your personnel has easy access to this information when an incident violates the defined policy thresholds. SAML (Security Assertion Markup Language) SAML is an XML-based data format for sharing authentication data between two parties. New Relic accounts must obtain a SAML certificate in order to enable Single Sign On for their users. For more information, see SAML service providers. Selenium Selenium is an open-source browser testing suite. Synthetics uses Selenium to test monitored websites with real browsers. For more information, see monitor types. service A service is a cluster of runtime server processes that accomplish a particular task, usually service requests. Unlike an application, a service is not usually invoked by a human. New Relic offers a variety of integrations that allow you to report data from your services. signal The stream of telemetry data that's watched and alerted on. You use NRQL queries to define a signal. signal filter When we receive data and it's routed to the streaming alerts platform, your NRQL WHERE clause will filter the data coming in. The filtered streaming data is what's evaluated for loss of signal violations, for example. span In a distributed trace, a span is a \"named, timed operation representing a contiguous segment of work in that trace\" (from OpenTracing.io definition). For distributed tracing, spans are displayed in the distributed tracing UI, and the data type Span is available to be queried. See also root span. SSL certificate SSL certificates encrypt data that is being transmitted. While New Relic refers to security certificates as SSL because it is a more commonly used term, all certificates adhere to industry standards for secure encryption in transit. SSO (single sign on) SSO (single sign on) allows you to manage user authentication in New Relic using an external SSO provider. For more information, see Setting up SSO. streaming algorithm This is what determines when the data in an aggregation window is processed. The streaming algorithm uses your server's clock time and the aggregation window size to trigger the alert evaluation process. sub-accounts See master account. Synthetic monitoring Synthetic monitoring allows you to monitor your website or API endpoint via automated, scriptable tools. Use free ping monitor to ensure your website is accessible, or expand your monitoring with browser monitors, which test your website with real browsers. Go further with scripting, to script browsers or API monitors for sophisticated testing. target A target is a resource or component monitored by a New Relic monitoring tool that has been identified in an alert condition. When the data source for that target crosses the defined critical threshold, we will open a violation. Depending on your policy's Incident preference setting, Alerts may create an incident record and send notifications through the defined channels. See also entity. tag Tags are key:value metadata added to monitored apps, hosts, dashboards, and other entities to help you organize your data at a high level. For details, see Tags. thresholds Thresholds are alert condition settings that define a violation. Threshold values include the value a data source must pass to trigger a violation and the time-related settings that define a violation; for example: Passing a certain value for at least x minutes Passing a certain value only once in x minutes While the data source passes a certain value, a degradation period starts. Likewise, when that data source stops passing a certain value, a recovery period starts. The durations of these two time periods are defined in the alert condition threshold settings. Thresholds have a required critical (red) threshold and an optional warning (yellow) threshold. In the UI, the entity's health status indicator will change to yellow or red when a threshold has been crossed and a violation will open. For more information, see Define thresholds. For an explanation of how thresholds relate to other basic Alerts concepts, see Concepts and workflow. throughput Throughput is a measurement of user activity for a monitored application. APM throughput and Browser Monitoring throughput are measured in different ways: APM: requests per minute (RPM) Browser: page views per minute (PPM) tier A tier can refer to how New Relic categorizes or visualizes the various agent language ecosystems that we support. For example: In APM, the color-coded categories that appear on your app's main Overview chart show response time spent in various functions, processes, or agents as tiers; for example, request queuing, garbage collection, Middleware, JVMs, etc. In New Relic labels, TIER can be used to define or classify the client-server architecture; for example, front-end and back-end tiers. \"Tier\" may sometimes be used to refer to our pricing editions. time picker By default the New Relic UI shows data for the past 30 minutes, ending now. To change the time window, use the time picker. time range A time range can refer to a length of time selected in the New Relic UI. New Relic displays a time range depending on the range you select using the time picker. timeslice data See metric timeslice data. trace A trace is a description of how a request travels through a system. Trace data helps you understand the performance of your system and diagnose problems. For more information on how we use trace data, see New Relic data types. traffic light See health status. transaction A transaction is defined as one logical unit of work in an application. This term primarily refers to server-side transactions monitored by APM. For more information, see documentation about web transactions and non-web transactions. The term transaction is also sometimes used in Browser Monitoring. In that case, it primarily refers to activity beginning with a browser-side web request and ending with a complete page load. transaction trace A transaction trace is a complete picture of a single transaction, down to the database queries and exact invocation patterns. With transaction traces, New Relic gives you much deeper visibility into a single slow transaction, which can help you understand a broader problem. For more information, see Transaction traces. UI The New Relic user interface. For more information, see Standard page functions. user A user can refer to a specific user role in a New Relic account. For more information, see Users. UTC Universal Time Coordinated (UTC), or Coordinated Universal Time, is a standard timestamp for synchronizing time around the world. value function (metrics) The numeric value obtained from metric timeslice data; for example, an average, minimum, maximum, total, sample size, etc. violation A violation occurs when the entity monitored by an alert condition reports a value that crosses the thresholds defined in that condition. For an explanation of how violations relate to other basic alerts concepts, see Concepts and workflow. You can view a summary of the violations for a selected incident's page. You can also view the violations for a specific entity from the product's UI. web external Web external is the term applied to the portion of time spent in transactions to external applications from within the code of the application you are monitoring. That time can be a call to a third party company (a payment provider, for example) or it could be a call to another microservice within your own company. Web external demonstrates how performance is impacted by your code executing outside the application you are measuring. web transaction A transaction is defined as one logical unit of work in an application. This term primarily refers to server-side transactions monitored by APM. Web transactions are initiated with an HTTP request. For most organizations, these represent customer-centric interactions and thus are the most important transactions to monitor. For more information, see Web transactions and Non-web transactions. WebDriverJS WebDriver is a Selenium component, used to control Synthetics scripted browsers. Specifically, Synthetics uses WebDriverJS, a Node.js-based flavor of Selenium. For more information, see Writing scripted browsers and Scripted browser examples. workload A workload represents a group of entities that work together to provide a digital service.

      "body": "New Relic's global data hosting structure consists of two regions: the European Union (EU) region and the United States (US) region. Selecting your preferred region during the account setup process allows you to specify the region where your performance monitoring data will be hosted. You can also create accounts in each region. Requirements Access to the New Relic EU region requires the latest agent version. For new customers: Install the most recent agent version. For existing customers: Update to the most recent agent version. Minimum agent version required: C SDK 1.0.0 or higher Go 2.0.0 or higher Java 4.0.0 or higher .NET 8.0.0 or higher Node.js 3.0.0 or higher PHP 8.0.0.204 or higher Python 3.0.0.89 or higher Ruby 5.0.0.342 or higher Regions and availability Your choice of data center is not limited by your geographic location. You can choose to create an account with data hosted in either the EU or US region, regardless of where you or your systems reside. You can also create accounts in each region. New Relic offers almost all the same active products, features, support offerings, and performance levels in the EU region as what is offered in the US region. Exceptions: The following are not supported with an EU region account: Infinite Tracing is not available. APM's weekly performance reports are not available. Errors inbox is not available. Log patterns Deprecated products and features are not available. New Relic's Incident Intelligence service operates solely in the US whether you store your data in New Relic’s US region data center or New Relic’s EU region data center, by using New Relic Incident Intelligence, you consent that New Relic may move and store your data in the US region. New Relic CodeStream operates solely in the US. Whether you have selected New Relic's US or EU region data center during setup of your New Relic account, when using New Relic CodeStream, you consent that your New Relic CodeStream data will get stored in the US. Regions and account hierarchy You can create accounts in each region. If your data is currently being hosted in the US region, you must create a new account to store data in the EU region. You cannot view EU data from a US account, or US data from an EU account. The data collected remains separate. The data cannot be aggregated or migrated between accounts. For organizations that have a parent/child account structure, you can only have one parent account. For more, see Manage apps or users with child accounts. For partnership accounts, no changes to the partnership owner account are required. However, data cannot be shared across regions, so a partnership requires a parent account for each region. Hierarchy example for partnership accounts With partnership accounts, a new parent account must be created for any data to be host in the EU region. This hierarchy illustrates how global accounts are structured with partnership owner accounts. Data is not aggregated beyond the parent account. Example hierarchy for partnership organizations. Because data cannot be shared across regions, a partnership will require a parent account for each region. Create an EU region account To create a New Relic account in the EU region: Go to the New Relic signup page. OR If you have a specific offer from a New Relic partner, follow that link directly. Follow the online steps to create your account. From the Select your region dropdown, select European Union. Agree to the Terms of Service. When you receive an email confirmation message, select the link to confirm your account and sign in to New Relic. Then install or update to the most recent agent version. API endpoints for EU region accounts If you have an EU region account, use the appropriate endpoints to access the following New Relic APIs: API EU endpoint Browser source maps API sourcemaps.service. eu .newrelic.com Copy Infrastructure Alert API infra-api. eu .newrelic.com Copy Dashboard API rpm. eu .newrelic.com/api/explore/dashboards/list Copy Insert API insights-collector. eu01 .nr-data.net Copy Insights Query API insights-api. eu .newrelic.com Copy Mobile apps rpm. eu .newrelic.com/mobile Copy NerdGraph GraphiQL API api. eu .newrelic.com/graphiql Copy Partner API The partner API is a global API with no regional data differences. Use this endpoint for both EU and US accounts: rpm.newrelic.com/api/v2/partners/ Copy REST API api. eu .newrelic.com Copy Synthetics API synthetics. eu .newrelic.com/synthetics/api Copy Trace API trace-api. eu .newrelic.com/trace/v1 Copy Metric API metric-api. eu .newrelic.com/metric/v1 Copy Log API log-api. eu .newrelic.com/log/v1 Copy Access New Relic One If your accounts report data to the EU data center, use the following link to go to New Relic One: one.eu.newrelic.com. Billing and pricing New Relic's account billing process and pricing options are the same for both the EU and US regions. Operational access and processing Customer Data is hosted in the region selected during account creation. Systems Operations Data is stored in the US region. All other information, including account information (such as license subscription information, billing, and internal monitoring) is hosted in the US region and replicated in the EU region. New Relic may access and process Customer Data in the United States and such other jurisdictions where New Relic has affiliates and subsidiaries, including as may be necessary to maintain, secure, or perform the services, to provide technical support, or as necessary to comply with law or a binding order of a government body. Customer Data from existing New Relic accounts cannot be transferred or shared across regions, and new data generated cannot be shared with existing accounts, even in partnership accounts. Verify your account is based in EU region Use either of these options to verify whether your account data is hosted in the EU region's data center: In APM, mouse over the application name to view the URL. If it begins with rpm.eu.newrelic.com/, it is an EU-based account. Check your New Relic license key. If it begins with EU, it is an EU-based account.",

      "body": "BETA FEATURE This feature is currently in beta. What permissions do I need to use New Relic's Service Levels? To use New Relic's Service Levels and see SLO results, you need a full platform user. However, in order to create new SLIs and SLOs, you need the specific capability in your role to modify events to metric rules. If you get the following errors, check your user permissions: The UI has disabled the option to save an SLI/SLO. The API returns the error message “Cannot query field \\\"eventExportRegisterRule\\\" on type \\\"RootMutationType\\\".”. How do I get support from New Relic during the public beta? Service Levels Management is in public beta, and no official support is offered yet through the Support portal. If you have general questions and feedback, please post them on the Explorers Hub. New Relic’s community and the product team will be glad to help you there. If you have suggestions about documentation, please suggest an improvement or send your contribution using the Create issue or Edit page buttons on the top right corner in the docs UI. Why don’t I see any data right after I create an SLI? New Relic starts generating new SLI metrics from the moment that you create an SLI. This is why we need a few minutes before we can start showing the first meaningful SLI attainment results. The benefit of the new data is that it has 13 month retention by default, and it’s more efficient to query for long periods of time. Can I configure an SLI on any entity type? Yes, you can configure an SLI on any entity type, such as an APM service, a browser application, or a Lambda function. SLI queries support NRDB events. Support for dimensional metrics on SLI queries is on our roadmap. Can I get alerts on SLI data? Alerts on New Relic's Service Levels are on our roadmap. How does New Relic calculate the remaining error budget? The remaining error budget indicates what percentage of requests could still have a bad response over the SLO period without compromising the objective. Therefore, the total amount of tolerated bad responses will vary with the throughput of requests. Time-based error budgets are on our roadmap.",

      "body": "BETA FEATURE This feature is currently in beta. With New Relic you can define and consume service level indicators and service level objectives for your applications. What are SLIs and SLOs? Service Levels are used to measure the performance of a service from the end user (or client application) point of view. For instance, a Service Level can represent whether a video loaded quickly enough, or whether a directions service returned at least one possible route between two points. Service level indicators (SLIs) are accurate quantitative measures of the user experience as described by a service level. They represent a proportion of successful outputs, and therefore they’re expressed as a percentage (%). For example, an SLI can measure the proportion of requests that were faster than some threshold, or the proportion of records coming into a pipeline that resulted in the correct value coming out. And while users understand that a video might take a few additional seconds to load, or that an application might return an error from time to time, this shouldn’t happen often if you don’t want to lose their trust. Therefore, once you’ve defined SLIs for the performance aspects that are most relevant for the end users of your services, you need to set SLOs to track that the service is meeting their expectations. Service level objectives (SLOs) are defined as a target value that an SLI must meet over a period of time. For example, videos must start playing in less than 2 seconds 99% of the time over a week period. Please refer to the Service Level management use case implementation guide to learn more about identifying service boundaries and deploying the instrumentation that your service levels will be based on. Service Levels and APM SLA reports New Relic has provided automatic SLA Reports for APM Services for a long time. The Apdex-based reports, which you can get on your email inbox on Mondays, are automatically generated for services that produce web transactions, and are useful to see trends over time. On top of the SLAs, our new SLM level capability is better aligned with modern service level best practices, such as those promoted by the Google SRE Handbook, and provides new, improved functionality: SLIs can be defined on any NRDB event that is reported to New Relic, not just APM transactions. Therefore you can also base SLIs on your own custom events. You can decide which service boundaries and which metrics are relevant for your service levels, and you can set your own objectives. You can view SLO results across your accounts, and within your workloads. What's next? Ready to get started? If you don't already have one, sign up for a free New Relic account. You can find Service Levels in several places in New Relic One: At the top nav bar, under the More menu (which you can customize). At the previews of those entities that have an SLI defined. In APM services, at the reports section. Within a workload, at the Service Levels tab. Carry on and read our docs on how to create and consume SLIs and SLOs. You can also check out how to manage SLMs with our API.",

      "body": "BETA FEATURE This feature is currently in beta. After you create your set of SLIs and SLOs, New Relic will start generating SLI data. The first results will take a few minutes to appear in the New Relic One UI. Find Service Levels: At the top nav bar, under Service Levels in the More menu (which you can customize). Here you can filter the SLIs by entity tags. At the previews of those entities that have an SLI defined. You can find them all around the UI. For instance, click on an entity from the Explorer's Navigator view. In APM services, at the reports section. In any workload that contains the SLI entity, such as an APM service or browser application. If you want to group SLIs under a certain workload, make sure to add the APM service or browser app to an existing workload, or create a new one. Click on any SLI to open the SLI card, which contains: The entity the SLI refers to, and the SLI name. Each row represents an SLO with: Target and time window. Compliance in the SLO period. Remaining requests error budget. Check your SLOs state Request-based SLOs are determined from SLIs defined as the ratio of the number of good responses to the total number of requests. This means a request-based SLO is met when that ratio meets or exceeds the goal for the SLO compliance period. If the SLO row has a green background, you’re doing good for the period. You may have not served successfully 100% of the requests, but you still have some remaining error budget to consume. If the SLO row has a yellow background, your error budget is closer to being totally consumed, and you should be more cautious for the rest of the period. If the SLO row has a red background, you’ve not reached the target SLO in this period, and you’ve consumed all of your error budget. Be careful if you need to deploy, and plan some work to improve your SLIs. You can click on the SLO to see more data about the entity, such as the golden metrics, the latest deployments, anomalies, and ongoing issues. This data can help you understand when and why you missed the SLO targets. You can define more than one SLO for the same SLI to check how fast you’re consuming the error budget. For instance, if you have an error budget of 0,1% requests for a whole week, you may not want to consume most of it in a single day, or the SLO will be at risk for the rest of the week. Understand Service Levels details We provide SLI details for two main purposes: For SLO analysis: See in which time ranges the SLO targets were missed. For SLI/SLO configuration and fine tuning: Learn how New Relic calculated SLO values. The SLI card contains the following charts: Good and bad responses These are the key concepts to analyze Service Levels: A valid request is any request that you want to count as meaningful for your SLIs. A good response is any response that you consider to provide a good experience (for example, the service responded in less than 2 seconds, providing a good navigation experience for the end user). A bad response is any response that you consider to provide a bad experience (like the service responded with a server error, interrupting the user's flow). This chart shows the total number of valid requests that your service received, broken down by good or bad. This chart shows the actual throughput of your service, which you can use to see if there’s any correlation between the increase of throughput and bad responses. SLI attainment over time (%) It's the proportion of what you consider good responses over time. The line should stay close to 100%, meaning that most requests were served successfully. Compliance over the period It's the ratio of good events (responses) to total events (requests), measured over the SLO compliance period. The closer to 100%, the closer your service is to meet the SLO target over the period. When this percentage goes below the SLO target, the chart will turn red: You need to put more effort in reliability. Remaining error budget (Requests) The error budget is an alternative way to read the SLO. It indicates what percentage of requests could still have a bad response over the SLO period, without compromising the objective. As the total amount of tolerated bad responses will vary with the request throughput, New Relic shows the percentage of remaining error budget: As long as the remaining error budget is above 25%, you'll see green, and your SLO is good. When the error budget goes below 25%, it will turn yellow. This means you’re close to burning the whole budget for the period. You may want to be more careful with new deployments and changes, and plan for some reliability work. Once the error budget is completely spent, it will show in red. SLI attainment over time and SLO target (%) The last chart shows two time series: the (SLI attainment over time) [#sli-over-time] , and the SLO target. When the SLI value is below the SLO target,your service is missing the SLO. Use this chart to learn in which time ranges your service missed the SLO target. Analyze bad responses When an SLO is not compliant, you need to analyze the original data to better understand what the impact is for your customer, with a special focus on what went wrong. At the Service Levels page, click the ... menu in any SLI and select Analyze. You'll access the query that represents the original NRDB events used to determine the bad responses which calculate the SLI attainment. You can then use the query builder to facet and filter down the unsuccessful responses by user account, client id, requesting source, etc. to better understand the cause and impact of missing your SLIs.",

      "body": "True observability is the power of knowing what's happening across your digital system and why it's happening—at any time, whatever solution you’re using. It’s getting the whole picture of everything that enables your applications and devices to deliver value to your customers, from the container running a microservice in the cloud to a mobile website's shopping cart button. Our platform goes beyond simple monitoring by offering you observability: data insights to help you make proactive and predictive improvements to your environment. A comparison between simple monitoring and observability. Get your data into New Relic We provide hundreds of tools to get your data into New Relic so you can analyze everything in one place. Our solutions give you a steady flow of useful data to help you fix problems quickly, maintain complex systems, improve your code, and accelerate your digital transformation. Whatever data you need to report and analyze, chances are that we have solutions for you. But if you have a situation we don't offer a pre-built solution for, we have powerful options for building your own solutions. All the answers in one place Once your data is in New Relic, we give you a UI with tools to cut through the layers of complexity surrounding your systems. This is all in one platform so you don't need to switch between diagnostic applications. You can interrogate your data for patterns, discover them using our data platform, or get proactive results from our machine learning tools. As a full platform user you get access to our entire set of observability tools. All our tools are interconnected and accessible in New Relic One. All the data you bring to New Relic through agents and integrations are metrics, events, logs, and traces that feed our platform's analytics and monitoring capabilities. New Relic links your data in a meaningful way so that you can explore it, build dashboards, and set up alerts. Our out-of-the-box observability UI experiences allow to visualize, analyze, and troubleshoot your entire software stack in one unified platform. The New Relic Explorer consolidates all the entities in your system, and how they're connected, in a single place, so you can easily detect performance trends and issues. By automatically connecting infrastructure health with application performance and end-user behavior, you can cut through the noise to find useful signals. Troubleshoot from anywhere in your stack Being fully-connected, the New Relic UI allows you to start your observability journey from any element of your stack. For example, you can get to crucial infrastructure logs from traces of an application running on a problematic Kubernetes pod. Use the Explorer in New Relic One to access and observe the full stack of your software, see performance data and alerting status at a glance, and check relationships. We provide you with a simple, yet powerful visual tool to monitor all your entities, that is, anything we can identify that reports data. In the New Relic ecosystem, entities include basic components like applications, hosts, containers, or database services, but it can also refer to custom groupings of such elements. You can also create your own entities. The more entities you instrument, the more data you'll bring in. The more data you've brought to New Relic, the more you'll understand your metrics, events, logs, and traces. Here are some examples of UI paths you might follow to drill into your data: You want to instrument...

      "body": "BETA FEATURE This feature is currently in beta. What permissions do I need to use New Relic's Service Levels? To use New Relic's Service Levels and see SLO results, you need a full platform user. However, in order to create new SLIs and SLOs, you need the specific capability in your role to modify events to metric rules. If you get the following errors, check your user permissions: The UI has disabled the option to save an SLI/SLO. The API returns the error message “Cannot query field \\\"eventExportRegisterRule\\\" on type \\\"RootMutationType\\\".”. How do I get support from New Relic during the public beta? Service Levels Management is in public beta, and no official support is offered yet through the Support portal. If you have general questions and feedback, please post them on the Explorers Hub. New Relic’s community and the product team will be glad to help you there. If you have suggestions about documentation, please suggest an improvement or send your contribution using the Create issue or Edit page buttons on the top right corner in the docs UI. Why don’t I see any data right after I create an SLI? New Relic starts generating new SLI metrics from the moment that you create an SLI. This is why we need a few minutes before we can start showing the first meaningful SLI attainment results. The benefit of the new data is that it has 13 month retention by default, and it’s more efficient to query for long periods of time. Can I configure an SLI on any entity type? Yes, you can configure an SLI on any entity type, such as an APM service, a browser application, or a Lambda function. SLI queries support NRDB events. Support for dimensional metrics on SLI queries is on our roadmap. Can I get alerts on SLI data? Alerts on New Relic's Service Levels are on our roadmap. How does New Relic calculate the remaining error budget? The remaining error budget indicates what percentage of requests could still have a bad response over the SLO period without compromising the objective. Therefore, the total amount of tolerated bad responses will vary with the throughput of requests. Time-based error budgets are on our roadmap.",

This is located in the top right of most New Relic UI pages. For more on factors that affect access to accounts, see Factors affecting access. To find account settings, use the account dropdown. administrator A type of user role on a New Relic account. For more information, see Users. agent At New Relic, an agent is a piece of monitoring software that provides integrations with various technologies (for example, web frameworks, host operating systems, or database types). The agents send that data to New Relic, usually on a specific cadence. For more information, see: New Relic Instant Observability Install agents agent API Some New Relic agents have agent APIs that allow you to extend the functionality of an agent. You can use the API to control, customize and extend the functionality of the agent. Here are some agent API docs: APM agents: C SDK API Go agent API Java agent API .NET agent API Node.js agent API PHP agent API Ruby agent API Python agent API Browser agent: Browser agent API Mobile agents: iOS SDK API Android SDK API aggregated metrics Aggregated metric data summarizes calls to specific methods in your application, including how many times each one was called and response times. In the New Relic UI, you see the class and method names along with their aggregate numbers. Metric data aggregation depends on the New Relic tool and your subscription level. For more information, see the documentation about data retention. aggregation delay The length of time in seconds to wait for the aggregation window to fill with data. Required when using CADENCE or EVENT_FLOW aggreation_method types. aggregation function You can use NRQL query functions, such as sum(), average(), or latest() to choose how the data points in an aggregation window should be processed into a single data point. The single aggregated data point is what's passed through the alert evaluation process. aggregation method New Relic aggregates data into windows, and needs to determine when the current window ends and the next one begins. The aggregation_method is the logic that tells us when we have all the data for a given aggregation window. Once the window is closed, the data is aggregated into a single point and evaluated against the threshold. This field is optional. One of the following three values can be specified: EVENT_FLOW: (Default) Each aggregation window will wait until it starts to see timestamps arrive that are past its own delay setting. Once this occurs, the data is published. Relies on the timestamps of arriving data, so wall-clock time is no longer relevant. Works best for sources that come in frequently and with low event spread (high througput metrics) CADENCE: Classic New Relic logic where each evaluation window waits exactly as long as the aggregation_delay setting, using the wall-clock time as a timer. aggregation_delay is required when using this option. Data arriving too late will be dropped, which can cause false alerts. EVENT_TIMER: Each aggregation window has a timer on it, set to the aggregation_timer setting. The Timer starts running as soon as the first data point appears for that aggregation window (based on the data point’s timestamp). The aggregation_timer is reset for each new data point that arrives for that window. Once the aggregation_timer reaches 0, the aggregation window is published. Ideal for sparse and batched data, such as cloud integrations and infrequent error logs. aggregation timer The length of time in seconds to wait after each data point received, to ensure the entire batch is processed. Required when using EVENT_TIMER aggregation_method type. aggregation window Streaming alerts gathers data together into specific amounts of time. These windows of time are customizable. Data points are collected together based their timestamps and reported as a batch. The customizable aggregation window provides greater flexibility and fewer false violations when alerting on irregular or less frequent data points. alert An alert communicates an event or incident that designated personnel can track through Alerts. For an explanation of how basic alerts concepts are related, see Concepts and workflow. alert condition An alert condition (or condition), identified by its unique numeric condition_id, contains the criteria for creating a violation. The condition includes the threshold that is set for a metric timeslice or a custom metric over time on a chosen target. For an explanation of how a condition relates to other basic alerts concepts, see Concepts and workflow. alert evaluation Streaming data is assessed on a set of aggregation windows to determine if an alert condition is violating or recovering. The aggregation window time is how long we'll collect data before running the NRQL query condition. The offset evaluation time is how long you want us to wait for late data before assessing it. If a window doesn't have any data points, it's treated as a gap for loss of signal. alert policy A collection of one or more conditions, one or more notification channels, and an Incident preference setting. If a condition contained within the policy opens a violation, an incident may be opened depending on the Incident preference setting. Notifications will then be sent to all channels attached to the policy. For an explanation of how a policy relates to other basic alerts concepts, see Concepts and workflow. apdex Apdex is an industry-standard way to measure users' satisfaction with the response time of an application or service. New Relic rates each response as Satisfied, Tolerated, or Frustrated, and uses these ratings to calculate an overall user satisfaction score. For more information, see Apdex: Measure user satisfaction. apdex_f The response time above which a transaction are rated frustrating. Defaults to four times apdex_t. Requests that complete in less than apdex_t are rated satisfied. Requests that take longer than apdex_t, but less than four times apdex_t (apdex_f), are tolerated. Any requests that take longer than apdex_f are rated frustrating. For more information, see Apdex: Measure user satisfaction. apdex_t The response time above which a transaction is considered tolerable. The default value is 0.5 seconds, but you can change this in your Apdex settings. Requests that complete in less than apdex_t are rated satisfied. Requests that take more than apdex_t, but less than apdex_f, are tolerated. Any requests that take longer than apdex_f are rated frustrating. For more information, see Apdex: Measure user satisfaction. API (application programming interface) New Relic offers a variety of APIs and SDKs. For more information, see the introduction to New Relic's APIs. APM New Relic's APM (application performance monitoring) provides monitoring of your web or non-web application's performance. APM supports apps using several programming languages. application For New Relic purposes, any program instrumented by New Relic. application ID Some New Relic solutions assign a monitored application a unique application ID, often shortened to app ID. When present, this ID is available in the UI. It is also reported as an attribute and can be queried. For how to determine this, see Find app ID. application name The name that New Relic combines with your license key to uniquely identify a particular app. For more information, see Name your application. Applied Intelligence (AI) Applied Intelligence (AI) helps you find, troubleshoot, and resolve problems more quickly. Specifically, it’s a hybrid machine learning engine that reduces alert noise, correlates incidents, and automatically detects anomalies. Applied Intelligence includes Alerts, Incident Intelligence, and Proactive Detection. attribute Attributes are key-value pairs attached to data objects reported to New Relic. Attributes add detail, and they're similar to tags or labels in other SaaS software. You can explore this data by querying or searching via the UI or by using the data dictionary. Examples: APM reports a Transaction event. This includes timing data for the transaction in a duration attribute, which might have a value of .002. Our Infrastructure Monitoring reports a ProcessSample event. This includes a variety of CPU usage attributes, including a cpuSystemPercent attribute, which might have a value of .01. Our Telemetry SDK reports a Metric data type for storing metrics, with attached attributes like metricName and newrelic.source. Some New Relic tools allow you to report custom attributes to enhance your monitoring. For more information about attributes in APM, see Agent attributes. availability monitoring See Types of Synthetics monitors. browser The New Relic UI supports most browsers. For more information, see Supported browsers. For our end-user browser monitoring tool, see Browser Monitoring. Browser monitoring A Real User Monitoring (RUM) solution that measures the speed and performance of your end users as they navigate to your site from different web browsers, devices, operating systems, and networks. background external See web external. child account See parent account. cloud-based integration New Relic offers cloud-based integrations with providers such as Amazon Web Services (AWS), Microsoft Azure, and Google Cloud Platform. collector The component that collects data from New Relic agents running on an app server, mobile device, or end-user browser. While the agent is installed on a user's app server, the collectors are centrally located in New Relic's data center. In order to contact the collector, the agent must be able to reach New Relic's domains and IP addresses. (The exact domain or IP depends on the New Relic monitoring tool.) The collector receives and interprets this data, and stores it in a database. The data is then retrieved and presented in the New Relic UI and by our various REST APIs. Command line interface (CLI) Our command line interface (CLI) is a tool you can use to build a New Relic application. This is the same tool our own engineers use. Go here for quick start instructions. Go to our Developer site for sample apps and guides. compute unit (CU) A unit of measurement that determines your pricing for some New Relic products governed by our original product-based pricing model. For more information, see Compute unit pricing. condition_id See alert condition. CPM (calls per minute) The number of calls your application receives each minute. This usually corresponds to the number of page views or external connections, and is usually the same as RPM (requests per minute). CPU burn The time consumed by code minus the wait time for a transaction. This is the time actually spent processing the transaction. It appears in the New Relic UI at the top of the transaction view for the agents that provide it (Ruby and PHP only). custom attribute A key-value pair added to a transaction or event in order to gain additional information about it. For more information, see custom attributes. custom dashboard A customizable dashboard with charts and tables that includes data from multiple New Relic data sources. For more information, see dashboards. custom event An event, in New Relic terms, is a data object with attached attributes. New Relic reports default event types, like Transaction and TransactionError. You can also create your own events. Events can be queried, and are used in some other features. You can generate custom events with APM agents, the browser monitoring agent, the mobile monitoring agents, and via the Event API. Alternatively, you can add custom attributes to some existing default New Relic events. custom instrumentation Custom instrumentation allows you to extend New Relic's monitoring to instrument code elements New Relic doesn't automatically instrument. Custom instrumentation is useful when your framework is not supported by New Relic, or when New Relic fails to pick up some element of your program. You can also use custom instrumentation to block a transaction from being reported entirely. For more information, see Custom instrumentation. custom metric Metric timeslice data that is manually recorded via an API call. Custom metrics allow you to record arbitrary metrics; for example, timing or computer resource data. All custom metric names must be prefixed with Custom/. For more information, see Custom metrics. Not to be confused with custom instrumentation data. data collector See collector. data explorer Use the data explorer to access, query and customize your data, create visualizations, and make connections between your services in a consistent and curated experience. For more on using the data explorer, see Introduction to the data explorer. degradation period When a data source enters a violating state, a degradation period of time begins. The degradation period is set in the condition's threshold. A violation will open if the source stays in a violating state for the entire degradation period. In addition: If the data source enters a non-violating state before the entire time has elapsed, the degradation period countdown is reset, and a violation does not open. If your alert condition threshold is configured as at least once in, the degradation period always lasts a single minute. dimensional metric A dimensional metric is a metric that has multiple attributes, also known as dimensions. At New Relic, we report dimensional metrics using the Metric data type. For more on other metric data types, see Metric data. Docker An open platform for distributed applications, which allows you to assemble multi-container portable apps. Infrastructure Monitoring includes integrated Docker monitoring. For more information about Docker, see the Docker website. downtime The period of time when customers cannot access your site and your app is not reporting to New Relic. For more information, see Synthetic Monitoring and Types of synthetic monitors. entity In New Relic, an entity is anything we can identify that has data you can monitor. An entity can be something you monitor directly, like applications and microservices, or indirectly, like data centers. You can identify one or more entities to be targets for alert conditions. In the Alerts API, the entity being monitored is identified with an entity_id. For more on this, see What are entities? event The word event is a general term that can have many meanings. At New Relic, event can have several meanings: At New Relic, event data is one of our core data types. Event data represents a record of a single event at a particular moment in time. Events can vary by type (for example, Transaction or Mobile, and will have associated attributes (for example, timestamp or transactionName). For more details, see Event data. For our infrastructure monitoring, the word event can be used to refer to important system and host activity. For example, a configuration change for a monitored host would be registered on Infrastructure's Events UI page. For alerts, the Events UI page displays a list of alerts-related incidents for your monitored entities. Events are reported for a violation opening and for closing. In some contexts, event can refer to any NRQL-queryable data type. For example, when you run a NRQL query, you will see a count of inspected events: this refers to a count of all data types queried. expected error An expected error is a common error that you don't want to affect your Apdex score or error rate. For more information, see Manage errors in APM. exporter At New Relic, an exporter is a type of integration that reports telemetry data to New Relic from a third-party (non-New Relic) telemetry tool. For examples, see Exporters, or search our integration quickstarts in New Relic I/O. Flex New Relic Flex is an application-agnostic, all-in-one infrastructure integration. With it, you can build your own integration that collects metric data from a wide variety of services, and that can instrument any app that exposes metrics over a standard protocol (HTTP, file, shell) in a standard format (for example, JSON or plain text) to the terminal. It's a recommended way to create a custom integration, because it doesn't require coding skills. framework A framework is a structured collection of pre-defined functions, into which an application builder inserts their own code to build their application. A framework is not the same as a library. While a library is a collection of functions you can call as needed, a framework is a skeleton for your application. The functions in that framework then call your functions. For more about the distinction between a framework and a library, see What is the difference between a framework and a library?. New Relic automatically instruments many common frameworks. For more about the frameworks New Relic supports, see the agent-specific documentation: C SDK supported frameworks Go supported frameworks Java supported frameworks .NET supported frameworks Node.js supported frameworks PHP supported frameworks Python supported frameworks Ruby supported frameworks harvest cycle The period of time between each connection from a New Relic agent to the collector. Between harvest cycles, an agent collects and caches data. At the end of the cycle an agent reports those data to the collector, then begins a new harvest cycle. health status indicator Some New Relic UI pages have a health status indicator appearing next to an index of monitored entities. This is a colored bar (generally green, yellow, red, or gray) indicating the status of your app or other entity monitored by New Relic. It also indicates whether the entity has any alert policies assigned to it and whether there are any policy violations. In general, the colored bar will be green, yellow, red, or gray to indicate the health status. Exceptions: Our REST API (v2) uses orange instead of yellow for the application's health and reporting status. Service maps use different criteria for reporting the health of a connection between an app and an external service not monitored by New Relic (for example, a third party API). host At New Relic, a host means one of the following: A physical machine is a hardware-based device with dedicated physical resources, including memory, processing, and storage. Each machine has its own OS which applications run on. A virtual machine (VM) is the software implementation of a physical machine that executes programs like a physical machine. One or more virtual machines can run on a physical machine. Each virtual machine has its own OS and allocated virtual machine resources such as RAM and CPU. A cloud instance is a type of virtual machine that is run in the public cloud. In this context, virtual machines and cloud instances are different from Java Virtual Machines (JVMs) and containers. host ID Each host identified by APM is assigned a host ID. This ID is used to uniquely identify it, and to retrieve data about that host via the REST API. For more information, see List host ID. ignored error An error that you have told the APM agent not to report to the collector. For more information, see Manage errors in APM. incident An incident is a collection of one or more violations of the conditions defined in an alert policy. An incident record includes all of the open and close time stamps for each violation, as well as chart snapshots of the data being evaluated around the time of each violation. You can view detailed information from the Incidents pages in the user interface. You can also select your preference for how we roll up violations into the incident. For an explanation of how an incident relates to other basic alerts concepts, see Concepts and workflow. Infrastructure monitoring By connecting changes in host performance to changes in your configuration, infrastructure monitoring provides real-time metrics and powerful analytics that reduce your mean-time-to-resolution (MTTR). Infrastructure is specifically designed for complex environments that need flexible, dynamic server monitoring, from a physical datacenter to thousands of Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) instances and other types of integrations. Insights Insights was the name for the New Relic product that previously governed the reporting of custom events, as well as the ability to query and chart your New Relic data. These features are now a fundamental part of the New Relic One platform and are no longer governed by the Insights product or name. To learn more about these features: Event API for reporting custom events Query and chart data For historical reasons, the word \"Insights\" is still used in some places. For example: Some APM agents still have Insights language in their codebase. For example, the Java agent custom_insights_events configuration. For New Relic organizations on our original pricing model, Insights Pro is still the product name governing custom event data ingest and retention. There is an API key called the Insights insert key. instance ID Each instance identified by New Relic is assigned a unique instance ID. Instance IDs are most commonly found for JVMs (Java Virtual Machines), but can exist for each agent. This ID is used to uniquely identify it, and to retrieve data about that instance via the REST API. For more information, see List instance IDs. instrumentation The collection of data from an application or host. When New Relic instruments a framework, it detects the methods and calls used by that framework, and intelligently groups them together. integration At New Relic, an integration refers to a solution that integrates with a specific technology (like a web framework or a type of database). All our integrations can be found as quickstarts in New Relic Instant Observability. interaction In our mobile monitoring, an interaction is a specific code path initiated by a user interaction (usually a button press). An interaction is the mobile equivalent of a transaction, and like a transaction an interaction can be traced and monitored. You can see much of the data included in an interaction in the BrowserInteraction event. interaction trace An interaction trace is a complete picture of a single interaction. With interaction traces, New Relic gives you much deeper visibility into a single slow interaction, which can help you understand a broader problem. Interaction traces are the mobile equivalent of a transaction trace. For more information, see Creating interactions (iOS) and Creating interactions (Android). inventory data Inventory data is information about the status or configuration of a service or host. Examples of inventory data include: Configuration settings Name of the host the service is on Amazon AWS region Port being used For more information, see Understand and use data. key transaction A web transaction that the user has marked as particularly important; for example, key business events (such as signups or purchase confirmations), or transactions with a high performance impact (such as searches). Key transactions have their own pages in the UI and other customized values. For more information, see Key transactions. launcher A launcher is a specific piece of code you can include when you create a New Relic One app. It creates the tile on the homepage that you click to launch the app. For more information, see the documentation about core UI components. log A log is a message about a system used to understand the activity of the system and to diagnose problems. For more information on how we use log data, see Log management. Log monitoring Our log management and monitoring features give you the tools to collect, process, explore, visualize, and alert on your log data using your existing log forwarder. With all of your log data in one place, you'll be able to make better decisions, detect and resolve problems more quickly, and see your logs in context to troubleshoot faster. Logs Our Logs feature is a scalable log management platform that allows you to connect your log data with the rest of your telemetry data. Pre-built plugins with some of the most common open-source logging tools make it simple to send your data from anywhere to New Relic. Logs in context Logs in context makes it easy to link to your log data with related data across the rest of our platform. Bringing all of this data together in a single tool allows you to quickly get to the root cause of an issue and find the log lines that you need to identify and resolve a problem. master account See parent account. metric A metric is a numeric measurement. Metric data is a broad category because there are several ways to make and report measurements. For more about how metrics are reported at New Relic, see New Relic data types. metric timeslice New Relic reports metrics in several ways. One variety of metric data is called metric timeslice data; this is the type of data used to generate many of the charts in APM, mobile monitoring, and browser monitoring (for more details, see metric timeslice data). Over time, metric timeslice data is aggregated into longer timeslice data records for more efficient storage. For more about how we aggregate this type of data, see Data aggregation. For how to query this type of data, see Query metric timeslice data. metric grouping issue A metric grouping issue occurs when an account sends too many differently named metric timeslice data points to New Relic, and those individual web transactions are not properly aggregated. For example, rather than a single /user/controlpanel/ metric name, you might see /user/controlpanel/alice, /user/controlpanel/bob, and /user/controlpanel/carol. For more information, see Metric grouping issues. minion The software that accepts monitor jobs from a private location. A minion is a packaged virtual appliance that runs in your hypervisor. For more information, see Private locations overview and install and configure private minions. Mobile monitoring Mobile monitoring allows you to monitor and manage the performance of your mobile apps on Android, iOS, tvOS, and other systems. Mobile monitoring provides end-to-end details, including crashes, throughput, HTTP requests, error traces, and more. Not to be confused with New Relic's own mobile apps for Android, iPhone, and iPad. monitor For our Synthetic Monitoring, a monitor ensures your website or API endpoint is available. For more information, see Adding and editing monitors. NerdGraph NerdGraph is our GraphQL API, an efficient and flexible query language that lets you request exactly the data you need, without over-fetching or under-fetching. NerdGraph calls get all the data you need in a single request. NerdGraph also makes it easier to evolve APIs over time and enables powerful developer tools. You can use our NerdGraph GraphiQL explorer to explore the schema and find definitions. With valid New Relic API key, you can try it out yourself at api.newrelic.com/graphiql. Nerdlet A Nerdlet is a component of a New Relic One application. It's a specific UI view, represented by a React JavaScript package. For more information, see Nerdpack file structure. Nerdpack A Nerdpack is a component of a New Relic One application. It's the package containing all the files needed by that application. For more information, see Nerdpack file structure. New Relic Edge with Infinite Tracing New Relic Edge with Infinite Tracing is a fully managed, distributed tracing service that observes 100% of your application traces, then provides actionable data so you can solve issues faster. For more information, see /docs/understand-dependencies/distributed-tracing/get-started/how-new-relic-distributed-tracing-works. New Relic One For more information, see Introduction to New Relic One. New Relic One catalog Our catalog is a collection of applications built on the New Relic One platform. The catalog includes custom apps we've built, public open source apps, and any apps that you buid. You can browse the catalog on New Relic One. NRQL (New Relic query language) NRQL is a query language, similar in form to SQL, that allows you to query the data stored in your New Relic account. non-web transaction APM identifies transactions as either web or non-web. When New Relic does not detect a transaction was initiated by a web request, this is called a non-web transaction. For more information, see Background processes and other non-web transactions. notification The message sent when an incident opens, is acknowledged, or closes. The type of notification is defined by the alert policy's notification channel. For an explanation of how notifications relate to other basic alerts concepts, see Concepts and workflow. notification channel Where we send a notification when an incident opens, is acknowledged, or closes. Available channels include email, mobile push notifications, webhooks, and more. on-host integration On-host integrations refer to integrations that reside on your own servers or hosts and that communicate with our infrastructure agent. For more information, see Introduction to on-host integrations. owner For accounts on our original pricing model, this is a type of user role: the user who initially created the account. For more information, see Users. page load timing With page load timing, New Relic monitors the full load time for end-user browsers. New Relic's application agents dynamically inject JavaScript into the page, then capture the following key load points: Navigation start: The user initiates the transaction. First byte: The browser receives the requested page. DOM ready: The browser has finished parsing DOM. Page ready: Page loading is complete. Page load timing is sometimes referred to as RUM, or real user monitoring. Unlike standard RUM, page load timing also captures JavaScript errors and AJAX requests. For more information, see Page load timing process. parameter Deprecated term; see attribute. parent account New Relic organizations can have a parent/child account structure. This structure was much more important for organizations on our original user model, but is still used for some features for organizations on the New Relic One user model. Learn more about account structure. Parent accounts were previously referred to as \"master accounts\", and child accounts were previously referred to as \"sub-accounts\". permalink A unique URL that links to a view of your application at a specific point in time. Permalinks are useful for troubleshooting and for sharing interesting time windows with colleagues. pinger The component of New Relic that connects to your website to verify your website is accessible. New Relic has pingers in Europe, Asia, and the United States. Each pinger attempts to contact your website at least once every two minutes. If enough pingers are unable to reach your website, your application will be considered down. For in-depth scriptable testing, including real browser tests and tests of API endpoints, see Synthetic Monitoring. Synthetic Monitoring includes free ping monitoring, which allows you to monitor your website from locations around the world. For more information, see Types of Synthetic monitors. polling interval (AWS) Our Amazon integrations query your AWS services according to a polling interval, which varies depending on the integration. Each polling interval occurs for every AWS entity. For example, if you have thirteen Elastic Load Balancers (ELB), each one will be polled every five minutes. Depending on the AWS integration, there may be delays in the timing between the API request and the metric data returned. If you notice unusual delays, follow the integration troubleshooting procedures. PPM (pages per minute) The number of pages per minute your application serves. private location A Synthetic monitor feature that allows you to run Synthetic monitors from within your own systems by creating private minions. Private locations allow you to extend your Synthetic coverage to new geographical locations, and to monitor websites behind your firewall such as an intranet site. For more information, see Private locations overview. recovery period A recovery period of time begins when a data source enters a non-violating state after being in a violating state. The recovery period is set in the condition's threshold. A violation will close when a source remains in a non-violating state and the recovery period time has elapsed. If the data source enters a violating state before the time has elapsed, the recovery period clock will reset and the violation won't close. response time The duration of time between a request for service and a response. For more information, see Response time. restricted user A type of user role on a New Relic account. For more information, see Users. rollup Using the same application name for multiple applications. This allows you to combine data in APM, either from multiple applications, or from multiple instances of an application. For more information, see Rolling up app data. root span For distributed tracing, the root span is the first span in a trace. In many cases, the root span duration will represent the duration of the entire trace, or be very close to it. However, for more complex, modern systems that use a lot of asynchronous, non-blocking processes, this will not be true. For those systems, the root span’s duration may be significantly less than the duration of the trace. RPM The term RPM usually refers to the number of requests per minute your application receives from users. This is usually the same as CPM (calls per minute). Historically, some New Relic monitoring solutions, like APM and Browser Monitoring, used to contain RPM in the URL; for example, https://rpm.newrelic.com. This language use originally referred to Rails performance management because the first iteration of our product monitored Ruby on Rails applications. We monitor many more languages and systems than Ruby now. RUM (real user monitoring) See page load timing. runbook A runbook contains standard procedures and operations typically used by system administrators, network operations staff, and other personnel to handle outages, alert incidents, and other situations. If your organization stores runbook instructions as URLs, you can link this information to an alerts policy so your personnel has easy access to this information when an incident violates the defined policy thresholds. SAML (Security Assertion Markup Language) SAML is an XML-based data format for sharing authentication data between two parties. New Relic accounts must obtain a SAML certificate in order to enable Single Sign On for their users. For more information, see SAML service providers. Selenium Selenium is an open-source browser testing suite. Synthetics uses Selenium to test monitored websites with real browsers. For more information, see monitor types. service A service is a cluster of runtime server processes that accomplish a particular task, usually service requests. Unlike an application, a service is not usually invoked by a human. New Relic offers a variety of integrations that allow you to report data from your services. signal The stream of telemetry data that's watched and alerted on. You use NRQL queries to define a signal. signal filter When we receive data and it's routed to the streaming alerts platform, your NRQL WHERE clause will filter the data coming in. The filtered streaming data is what's evaluated for loss of signal violations, for example. span In a distributed trace, a span is a \"named, timed operation representing a contiguous segment of work in that trace\" (from OpenTracing.io definition). For distributed tracing, spans are displayed in the distributed tracing UI, and the data type Span is available to be queried. See also root span. SSL certificate SSL certificates encrypt data that is being transmitted. While New Relic refers to security certificates as SSL because it is a more commonly used term, all certificates adhere to industry standards for secure encryption in transit. SSO (single sign on) SSO (single sign on) allows you to manage user authentication in New Relic using an external SSO provider. For more information, see Setting up SSO. streaming algorithm This is what determines when the data in an aggregation window is processed. The streaming algorithm uses your server's clock time and the aggregation window size to trigger the alert evaluation process. sub-accounts See master account. Synthetic monitoring Synthetic monitoring allows you to monitor your website or API endpoint via automated, scriptable tools. Use free ping monitor to ensure your website is accessible, or expand your monitoring with browser monitors, which test your website with real browsers. Go further with scripting, to script browsers or API monitors for sophisticated testing. target A target is a resource or component monitored by a New Relic monitoring tool that has been identified in an alert condition. When the data source for that target crosses the defined critical threshold, we will open a violation. Depending on your policy's Incident preference setting, Alerts may create an incident record and send notifications through the defined channels. See also entity. tag Tags are key:value metadata added to monitored apps, hosts, dashboards, and other entities to help you organize your data at a high level. For details, see Tags. thresholds Thresholds are alert condition settings that define a violation. Threshold values include the value a data source must pass to trigger a violation and the time-related settings that define a violation; for example: Passing a certain value for at least x minutes Passing a certain value only once in x minutes While the data source passes a certain value, a degradation period starts. Likewise, when that data source stops passing a certain value, a recovery period starts. The durations of these two time periods are defined in the alert condition threshold settings. Thresholds have a required critical (red) threshold and an optional warning (yellow) threshold. In the UI, the entity's health status indicator will change to yellow or red when a threshold has been crossed and a violation will open. For more information, see Define thresholds. For an explanation of how thresholds relate to other basic Alerts concepts, see Concepts and workflow. throughput Throughput is a measurement of user activity for a monitored application. APM throughput and Browser Monitoring throughput are measured in different ways: APM: requests per minute (RPM) Browser: page views per minute (PPM) tier A tier can refer to how New Relic categorizes or visualizes the various agent language ecosystems that we support. For example: In APM, the color-coded categories that appear on your app's main Overview chart show response time spent in various functions, processes, or agents as tiers; for example, request queuing, garbage collection, Middleware, JVMs, etc. In New Relic labels, TIER can be used to define or classify the client-server architecture; for example, front-end and back-end tiers. \"Tier\" may sometimes be used to refer to our pricing editions. time picker By default the New Relic UI shows data for the past 30 minutes, ending now. To change the time window, use the time picker. time range A time range can refer to a length of time selected in the New Relic UI. New Relic displays a time range depending on the range you select using the time picker. timeslice data See metric timeslice data. trace A trace is a description of how a request travels through a system. Trace data helps you understand the performance of your system and diagnose problems. For more information on how we use trace data, see New Relic data types. traffic light See health status. transaction A transaction is defined as one logical unit of work in an application. This term primarily refers to server-side transactions monitored by APM. For more information, see documentation about web transactions and non-web transactions. The term transaction is also sometimes used in Browser Monitoring. In that case, it primarily refers to activity beginning with a browser-side web request and ending with a complete page load. transaction trace A transaction trace is a complete picture of a single transaction, down to the database queries and exact invocation patterns. With transaction traces, New Relic gives you much deeper visibility into a single slow transaction, which can help you understand a broader problem. For more information, see Transaction traces. UI The New Relic user interface. For more information, see Standard page functions. user A user can refer to a specific user role in a New Relic account. For more information, see Users. UTC Universal Time Coordinated (UTC), or Coordinated Universal Time, is a standard timestamp for synchronizing time around the world. value function (metrics) The numeric value obtained from metric timeslice data; for example, an average, minimum, maximum, total, sample size, etc. violation A violation occurs when the entity monitored by an alert condition reports a value that crosses the thresholds defined in that condition. For an explanation of how violations relate to other basic alerts concepts, see Concepts and workflow. You can view a summary of the violations for a selected incident's page. You can also view the violations for a specific entity from the product's UI. web external Web external is the term applied to the portion of time spent in transactions to external applications from within the code of the application you are monitoring. That time can be a call to a third party company (a payment provider, for example) or it could be a call to another microservice within your own company. Web external demonstrates how performance is impacted by your code executing outside the application you are measuring. web transaction A transaction is defined as one logical unit of work in an application. This term primarily refers to server-side transactions monitored by APM. Web transactions are initiated with an HTTP request. For most organizations, these represent customer-centric interactions and thus are the most important transactions to monitor. For more information, see Web transactions and Non-web transactions. WebDriverJS WebDriver is a Selenium component, used to control Synthetics scripted browsers. Specifically, Synthetics uses WebDriverJS, a Node.js-based flavor of Selenium. For more information, see Writing scripted browsers and Scripted browser examples. workload A workload represents a group of entities that work together to provide a digital service.

If you're trying to switch between accounts, use the account switcher. account switcher If you have access to more than one account in a multi-account organization, you can use the account switcher to switch between accounts. This is located in the top right of most New Relic UI pages. For more on factors that affect access to accounts, see Factors affecting access. To find account settings, use the account dropdown. administrator A type of user role on a New Relic account. For more information, see Users. agent At New Relic, an agent is a piece of monitoring software that provides integrations with various technologies (for example, web frameworks, host operating systems, or database types). The agents send that data to New Relic, usually on a specific cadence. For more information, see: New Relic Instant Observability Install agents agent API Some New Relic agents have agent APIs that allow you to extend the functionality of an agent. You can use the API to control, customize and extend the functionality of the agent. Here are some agent API docs: APM agents: C SDK API Go agent API Java agent API .NET agent API Node.js agent API PHP agent API Ruby agent API Python agent API Browser agent: Browser agent API Mobile agents: iOS SDK API Android SDK API aggregated metrics Aggregated metric data summarizes calls to specific methods in your application, including how many times each one was called and response times. In the New Relic UI, you see the class and method names along with their aggregate numbers. Metric data aggregation depends on the New Relic tool and your subscription level. For more information, see the documentation about data retention. aggregation delay The length of time in seconds to wait for the aggregation window to fill with data. Required when using CADENCE or EVENT_FLOW aggreation_method types. aggregation function You can use NRQL query functions, such as sum(), average(), or latest() to choose how the data points in an aggregation window should be processed into a single data point. The single aggregated data point is what's passed through the alert evaluation process. aggregation method New Relic aggregates data into windows, and needs to determine when the current window ends and the next one begins. The aggregation_method is the logic that tells us when we have all the data for a given aggregation window. Once the window is closed, the data is aggregated into a single point and evaluated against the threshold. This field is optional. One of the following three values can be specified: EVENT_FLOW: (Default) Each aggregation window will wait until it starts to see timestamps arrive that are past its own delay setting. Once this occurs, the data is published. Relies on the timestamps of arriving data, so wall-clock time is no longer relevant. Works best for sources that come in frequently and with low event spread (high througput metrics) CADENCE: Classic New Relic logic where each evaluation window waits exactly as long as the aggregation_delay setting, using the wall-clock time as a timer. aggregation_delay is required when using this option. Data arriving too late will be dropped, which can cause false alerts. EVENT_TIMER: Each aggregation window has a timer on it, set to the aggregation_timer setting. The Timer starts running as soon as the first data point appears for that aggregation window (based on the data point’s timestamp). The aggregation_timer is reset for each new data point that arrives for that window. Once the aggregation_timer reaches 0, the aggregation window is published. Ideal for sparse and batched data, such as cloud integrations and infrequent error logs. aggregation timer The length of time in seconds to wait after each data point received, to ensure the entire batch is processed. Required when using EVENT_TIMER aggregation_method type. aggregation window Streaming alerts gathers data together into specific amounts of time. These windows of time are customizable. Data points are collected together based their timestamps and reported as a batch. The customizable aggregation window provides greater flexibility and fewer false violations when alerting on irregular or less frequent data points. alert An alert communicates an event or incident that designated personnel can track through Alerts. For an explanation of how basic alerts concepts are related, see Concepts and workflow. alert condition An alert condition (or condition), identified by its unique numeric condition_id, contains the criteria for creating a violation. The condition includes the threshold that is set for a metric timeslice or a custom metric over time on a chosen target. For an explanation of how a condition relates to other basic alerts concepts, see Concepts and workflow. alert evaluation Streaming data is assessed on a set of aggregation windows to determine if an alert condition is violating or recovering. The aggregation window time is how long we'll collect data before running the NRQL query condition. The offset evaluation time is how long you want us to wait for late data before assessing it. If a window doesn't have any data points, it's treated as a gap for loss of signal. alert policy A collection of one or more conditions, one or more notification channels, and an Incident preference setting. If a condition contained within the policy opens a violation, an incident may be opened depending on the Incident preference setting. Notifications will then be sent to all channels attached to the policy. For an explanation of how a policy relates to other basic alerts concepts, see Concepts and workflow. apdex Apdex is an industry-standard way to measure users' satisfaction with the response time of an application or service. New Relic rates each response as Satisfied, Tolerated, or Frustrated, and uses these ratings to calculate an overall user satisfaction score. For more information, see Apdex: Measure user satisfaction. apdex_f The response time above which a transaction are rated frustrating. Defaults to four times apdex_t. Requests that complete in less than apdex_t are rated satisfied. Requests that take longer than apdex_t, but less than four times apdex_t (apdex_f), are tolerated. Any requests that take longer than apdex_f are rated frustrating. For more information, see Apdex: Measure user satisfaction. apdex_t The response time above which a transaction is considered tolerable. The default value is 0.5 seconds, but you can change this in your Apdex settings. Requests that complete in less than apdex_t are rated satisfied. Requests that take more than apdex_t, but less than apdex_f, are tolerated. Any requests that take longer than apdex_f are rated frustrating. For more information, see Apdex: Measure user satisfaction. API (application programming interface) New Relic offers a variety of APIs and SDKs. For more information, see the introduction to New Relic's APIs. APM New Relic's APM (application performance monitoring) provides monitoring of your web or non-web application's performance. APM supports apps using several programming languages. application For New Relic purposes, any program instrumented by New Relic. application ID Some New Relic solutions assign a monitored application a unique application ID, often shortened to app ID. When present, this ID is available in the UI. It is also reported as an attribute and can be queried. For how to determine this, see Find app ID. application name The name that New Relic combines with your license key to uniquely identify a particular app. For more information, see Name your application. Applied Intelligence (AI) Applied Intelligence (AI) helps you find, troubleshoot, and resolve problems more quickly. Specifically, it’s a hybrid machine learning engine that reduces alert noise, correlates incidents, and automatically detects anomalies. Applied Intelligence includes Alerts, Incident Intelligence, and Proactive Detection. attribute Attributes are key-value pairs attached to data objects reported to New Relic. Attributes add detail, and they're similar to tags or labels in other SaaS software. You can explore this data by querying or searching via the UI or by using the data dictionary. Examples: APM reports a Transaction event. This includes timing data for the transaction in a duration attribute, which might have a value of .002. Our Infrastructure Monitoring reports a ProcessSample event. This includes a variety of CPU usage attributes, including a cpuSystemPercent attribute, which might have a value of .01. Our Telemetry SDK reports a Metric data type for storing metrics, with attached attributes like metricName and newrelic.source. Some New Relic tools allow you to report custom attributes to enhance your monitoring. For more information about attributes in APM, see Agent attributes. availability monitoring See Types of Synthetics monitors. browser The New Relic UI supports most browsers. For more information, see Supported browsers. For our end-user browser monitoring tool, see Browser Monitoring. Browser monitoring A Real User Monitoring (RUM) solution that measures the speed and performance of your end users as they navigate to your site from different web browsers, devices, operating systems, and networks. background external See web external. child account See parent account. cloud-based integration New Relic offers cloud-based integrations with providers such as Amazon Web Services (AWS), Microsoft Azure, and Google Cloud Platform. collector The component that collects data from New Relic agents running on an app server, mobile device, or end-user browser. While the agent is installed on a user's app server, the collectors are centrally located in New Relic's data center. In order to contact the collector, the agent must be able to reach New Relic's domains and IP addresses. (The exact domain or IP depends on the New Relic monitoring tool.) The collector receives and interprets this data, and stores it in a database. The data is then retrieved and presented in the New Relic UI and by our various REST APIs. Command line interface (CLI) Our command line interface (CLI) is a tool you can use to build a New Relic application. This is the same tool our own engineers use. Go here for quick start instructions. Go to our Developer site for sample apps and guides. compute unit (CU) A unit of measurement that determines your pricing for some New Relic products governed by our original product-based pricing model. For more information, see Compute unit pricing. condition_id See alert condition. CPM (calls per minute) The number of calls your application receives each minute. This usually corresponds to the number of page views or external connections, and is usually the same as RPM (requests per minute). CPU burn The time consumed by code minus the wait time for a transaction. This is the time actually spent processing the transaction. It appears in the New Relic UI at the top of the transaction view for the agents that provide it (Ruby and PHP only). custom attribute A key-value pair added to a transaction or event in order to gain additional information about it. For more information, see custom attributes. custom dashboard A customizable dashboard with charts and tables that includes data from multiple New Relic data sources. For more information, see dashboards. custom event An event, in New Relic terms, is a data object with attached attributes. New Relic reports default event types, like Transaction and TransactionError. You can also create your own events. Events can be queried, and are used in some other features. You can generate custom events with APM agents, the browser monitoring agent, the mobile monitoring agents, and via the Event API. Alternatively, you can add custom attributes to some existing default New Relic events. custom instrumentation Custom instrumentation allows you to extend New Relic's monitoring to instrument code elements New Relic doesn't automatically instrument. Custom instrumentation is useful when your framework is not supported by New Relic, or when New Relic fails to pick up some element of your program. You can also use custom instrumentation to block a transaction from being reported entirely. For more information, see Custom instrumentation. custom metric Metric timeslice data that is manually recorded via an API call. Custom metrics allow you to record arbitrary metrics; for example, timing or computer resource data. All custom metric names must be prefixed with Custom/. For more information, see Custom metrics. Not to be confused with custom instrumentation data. data collector See collector. data explorer Use the data explorer to access, query and customize your data, create visualizations, and make connections between your services in a consistent and curated experience. For more on using the data explorer, see Introduction to the data explorer. degradation period When a data source enters a violating state, a degradation period of time begins. The degradation period is set in the condition's threshold. A violation will open if the source stays in a violating state for the entire degradation period. In addition: If the data source enters a non-violating state before the entire time has elapsed, the degradation period countdown is reset, and a violation does not open. If your alert condition threshold is configured as at least once in, the degradation period always lasts a single minute. dimensional metric A dimensional metric is a metric that has multiple attributes, also known as dimensions. At New Relic, we report dimensional metrics using the Metric data type. For more on other metric data types, see Metric data. Docker An open platform for distributed applications, which allows you to assemble multi-container portable apps. Infrastructure Monitoring includes integrated Docker monitoring. For more information about Docker, see the Docker website. downtime The period of time when customers cannot access your site and your app is not reporting to New Relic. For more information, see Synthetic Monitoring and Types of synthetic monitors. entity In New Relic, an entity is anything we can identify that has data you can monitor. An entity can be something you monitor directly, like applications and microservices, or indirectly, like data centers. You can identify one or more entities to be targets for alert conditions. In the Alerts API, the entity being monitored is identified with an entity_id. For more on this, see What are entities? event The word event is a general term that can have many meanings. At New Relic, event can have several meanings: At New Relic, event data is one of our core data types. Event data represents a record of a single event at a particular moment in time. Events can vary by type (for example, Transaction or Mobile, and will have associated attributes (for example, timestamp or transactionName). For more details, see Event data. For our infrastructure monitoring, the word event can be used to refer to important system and host activity. For example, a configuration change for a monitored host would be registered on Infrastructure's Events UI page. For alerts, the Events UI page displays a list of alerts-related incidents for your monitored entities. Events are reported for a violation opening and for closing. In some contexts, event can refer to any NRQL-queryable data type. For example, when you run a NRQL query, you will see a count of inspected events: this refers to a count of all data types queried. expected error An expected error is a common error that you don't want to affect your Apdex score or error rate. For more information, see Manage errors in APM. exporter At New Relic, an exporter is a type of integration that reports telemetry data to New Relic from a third-party (non-New Relic) telemetry tool. For examples, see Exporters, or search our integration quickstarts in New Relic I/O. Flex New Relic Flex is an application-agnostic, all-in-one infrastructure integration. With it, you can build your own integration that collects metric data from a wide variety of services, and that can instrument any app that exposes metrics over a standard protocol (HTTP, file, shell) in a standard format (for example, JSON or plain text) to the terminal. It's a recommended way to create a custom integration, because it doesn't require coding skills. framework A framework is a structured collection of pre-defined functions, into which an application builder inserts their own code to build their application. A framework is not the same as a library. While a library is a collection of functions you can call as needed, a framework is a skeleton for your application. The functions in that framework then call your functions. For more about the distinction between a framework and a library, see What is the difference between a framework and a library?. New Relic automatically instruments many common frameworks. For more about the frameworks New Relic supports, see the agent-specific documentation: C SDK supported frameworks Go supported frameworks Java supported frameworks .NET supported frameworks Node.js supported frameworks PHP supported frameworks Python supported frameworks Ruby supported frameworks harvest cycle The period of time between each connection from a New Relic agent to the collector. Between harvest cycles, an agent collects and caches data. At the end of the cycle an agent reports those data to the collector, then begins a new harvest cycle. health status indicator Some New Relic UI pages have a health status indicator appearing next to an index of monitored entities. This is a colored bar (generally green, yellow, red, or gray) indicating the status of your app or other entity monitored by New Relic. It also indicates whether the entity has any alert policies assigned to it and whether there are any policy violations. In general, the colored bar will be green, yellow, red, or gray to indicate the health status. Exceptions: Our REST API (v2) uses orange instead of yellow for the application's health and reporting status. Service maps use different criteria for reporting the health of a connection between an app and an external service not monitored by New Relic (for example, a third party API). host At New Relic, a host means one of the following: A physical machine is a hardware-based device with dedicated physical resources, including memory, processing, and storage. Each machine has its own OS which applications run on. A virtual machine (VM) is the software implementation of a physical machine that executes programs like a physical machine. One or more virtual machines can run on a physical machine. Each virtual machine has its own OS and allocated virtual machine resources such as RAM and CPU. A cloud instance is a type of virtual machine that is run in the public cloud. In this context, virtual machines and cloud instances are different from Java Virtual Machines (JVMs) and containers. host ID Each host identified by APM is assigned a host ID. This ID is used to uniquely identify it, and to retrieve data about that host via the REST API. For more information, see List host ID. ignored error An error that you have told the APM agent not to report to the collector. For more information, see Manage errors in APM. incident An incident is a collection of one or more violations of the conditions defined in an alert policy. An incident record includes all of the open and close time stamps for each violation, as well as chart snapshots of the data being evaluated around the time of each violation. You can view detailed information from the Incidents pages in the user interface. You can also select your preference for how we roll up violations into the incident. For an explanation of how an incident relates to other basic alerts concepts, see Concepts and workflow. Infrastructure monitoring By connecting changes in host performance to changes in your configuration, infrastructure monitoring provides real-time metrics and powerful analytics that reduce your mean-time-to-resolution (MTTR). Infrastructure is specifically designed for complex environments that need flexible, dynamic server monitoring, from a physical datacenter to thousands of Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) instances and other types of integrations. Insights Insights was the name for the New Relic product that previously governed the reporting of custom events, as well as the ability to query and chart your New Relic data. These features are now a fundamental part of the New Relic One platform and are no longer governed by the Insights product or name. To learn more about these features: Event API for reporting custom events Query and chart data For historical reasons, the word \"Insights\" is still used in some places. For example: Some APM agents still have Insights language in their codebase. For example, the Java agent custom_insights_events configuration. For New Relic organizations on our original pricing model, Insights Pro is still the product name governing custom event data ingest and retention. There is an API key called the Insights insert key. instance ID Each instance identified by New Relic is assigned a unique instance ID. Instance IDs are most commonly found for JVMs (Java Virtual Machines), but can exist for each agent. This ID is used to uniquely identify it, and to retrieve data about that instance via the REST API. For more information, see List instance IDs. instrumentation The collection of data from an application or host. When New Relic instruments a framework, it detects the methods and calls used by that framework, and intelligently groups them together. integration At New Relic, an integration refers to a solution that integrates with a specific technology (like a web framework or a type of database). All our integrations can be found as quickstarts in New Relic Instant Observability. interaction In our mobile monitoring, an interaction is a specific code path initiated by a user interaction (usually a button press). An interaction is the mobile equivalent of a transaction, and like a transaction an interaction can be traced and monitored. You can see much of the data included in an interaction in the BrowserInteraction event. interaction trace An interaction trace is a complete picture of a single interaction. With interaction traces, New Relic gives you much deeper visibility into a single slow interaction, which can help you understand a broader problem. Interaction traces are the mobile equivalent of a transaction trace. For more information, see Creating interactions (iOS) and Creating interactions (Android). inventory data Inventory data is information about the status or configuration of a service or host. Examples of inventory data include: Configuration settings Name of the host the service is on Amazon AWS region Port being used For more information, see Understand and use data. key transaction A web transaction that the user has marked as particularly important; for example, key business events (such as signups or purchase confirmations), or transactions with a high performance impact (such as searches). Key transactions have their own pages in the UI and other customized values. For more information, see Key transactions. launcher A launcher is a specific piece of code you can include when you create a New Relic One app. It creates the tile on the homepage that you click to launch the app. For more information, see the documentation about core UI components. log A log is a message about a system used to understand the activity of the system and to diagnose problems. For more information on how we use log data, see Log management. Log monitoring Our log management and monitoring features give you the tools to collect, process, explore, visualize, and alert on your log data using your existing log forwarder. With all of your log data in one place, you'll be able to make better decisions, detect and resolve problems more quickly, and see your logs in context to troubleshoot faster. Logs Our Logs feature is a scalable log management platform that allows you to connect your log data with the rest of your telemetry data. Pre-built plugins with some of the most common open-source logging tools make it simple to send your data from anywhere to New Relic. Logs in context Logs in context makes it easy to link to your log data with related data across the rest of our platform. Bringing all of this data together in a single tool allows you to quickly get to the root cause of an issue and find the log lines that you need to identify and resolve a problem. master account See parent account. metric A metric is a numeric measurement. Metric data is a broad category because there are several ways to make and report measurements. For more about how metrics are reported at New Relic, see New Relic data types. metric timeslice New Relic reports metrics in several ways. One variety of metric data is called metric timeslice data; this is the type of data used to generate many of the charts in APM, mobile monitoring, and browser monitoring (for more details, see metric timeslice data). Over time, metric timeslice data is aggregated into longer timeslice data records for more efficient storage. For more about how we aggregate this type of data, see Data aggregation. For how to query this type of data, see Query metric timeslice data. metric grouping issue A metric grouping issue occurs when an account sends too many differently named metric timeslice data points to New Relic, and those individual web transactions are not properly aggregated. For example, rather than a single /user/controlpanel/ metric name, you might see /user/controlpanel/alice, /user/controlpanel/bob, and /user/controlpanel/carol. For more information, see Metric grouping issues. minion The software that accepts monitor jobs from a private location. A minion is a packaged virtual appliance that runs in your hypervisor. For more information, see Private locations overview and install and configure private minions. Mobile monitoring Mobile monitoring allows you to monitor and manage the performance of your mobile apps on Android, iOS, tvOS, and other systems. Mobile monitoring provides end-to-end details, including crashes, throughput, HTTP requests, error traces, and more. Not to be confused with New Relic's own mobile apps for Android, iPhone, and iPad. monitor For our Synthetic Monitoring, a monitor ensures your website or API endpoint is available. For more information, see Adding and editing monitors. NerdGraph NerdGraph is our GraphQL API, an efficient and flexible query language that lets you request exactly the data you need, without over-fetching or under-fetching. NerdGraph calls get all the data you need in a single request. NerdGraph also makes it easier to evolve APIs over time and enables powerful developer tools. You can use our NerdGraph GraphiQL explorer to explore the schema and find definitions. With valid New Relic API key, you can try it out yourself at api.newrelic.com/graphiql. Nerdlet A Nerdlet is a component of a New Relic One application. It's a specific UI view, represented by a React JavaScript package. For more information, see Nerdpack file structure. Nerdpack A Nerdpack is a component of a New Relic One application. It's the package containing all the files needed by that application. For more information, see Nerdpack file structure. New Relic Edge with Infinite Tracing New Relic Edge with Infinite Tracing is a fully managed, distributed tracing service that observes 100% of your application traces, then provides actionable data so you can solve issues faster. For more information, see /docs/understand-dependencies/distributed-tracing/get-started/how-new-relic-distributed-tracing-works. New Relic One For more information, see Introduction to New Relic One. New Relic One catalog Our catalog is a collection of applications built on the New Relic One platform. The catalog includes custom apps we've built, public open source apps, and any apps that you buid. You can browse the catalog on New Relic One. NRQL (New Relic query language) NRQL is a query language, similar in form to SQL, that allows you to query the data stored in your New Relic account. non-web transaction APM identifies transactions as either web or non-web. When New Relic does not detect a transaction was initiated by a web request, this is called a non-web transaction. For more information, see Background processes and other non-web transactions. notification The message sent when an incident opens, is acknowledged, or closes. The type of notification is defined by the alert policy's notification channel. For an explanation of how notifications relate to other basic alerts concepts, see Concepts and workflow. notification channel Where we send a notification when an incident opens, is acknowledged, or closes. Available channels include email, mobile push notifications, webhooks, and more. on-host integration On-host integrations refer to integrations that reside on your own servers or hosts and that communicate with our infrastructure agent. For more information, see Introduction to on-host integrations. owner For accounts on our original pricing model, this is a type of user role: the user who initially created the account. For more information, see Users. page load timing With page load timing, New Relic monitors the full load time for end-user browsers. New Relic's application agents dynamically inject JavaScript into the page, then capture the following key load points: Navigation start: The user initiates the transaction. First byte: The browser receives the requested page. DOM ready: The browser has finished parsing DOM. Page ready: Page loading is complete. Page load timing is sometimes referred to as RUM, or real user monitoring. Unlike standard RUM, page load timing also captures JavaScript errors and AJAX requests. For more information, see Page load timing process. parameter Deprecated term; see attribute. parent account New Relic organizations can have a parent/child account structure. This structure was much more important for organizations on our original user model, but is still used for some features for organizations on the New Relic One user model. Learn more about account structure. Parent accounts were previously referred to as \"master accounts\", and child accounts were previously referred to as \"sub-accounts\". permalink A unique URL that links to a view of your application at a specific point in time. Permalinks are useful for troubleshooting and for sharing interesting time windows with colleagues. pinger The component of New Relic that connects to your website to verify your website is accessible. New Relic has pingers in Europe, Asia, and the United States. Each pinger attempts to contact your website at least once every two minutes. If enough pingers are unable to reach your website, your application will be considered down. For in-depth scriptable testing, including real browser tests and tests of API endpoints, see Synthetic Monitoring. Synthetic Monitoring includes free ping monitoring, which allows you to monitor your website from locations around the world. For more information, see Types of Synthetic monitors. polling interval (AWS) Our Amazon integrations query your AWS services according to a polling interval, which varies depending on the integration. Each polling interval occurs for every AWS entity. For example, if you have thirteen Elastic Load Balancers (ELB), each one will be polled every five minutes. Depending on the AWS integration, there may be delays in the timing between the API request and the metric data returned. If you notice unusual delays, follow the integration troubleshooting procedures. PPM (pages per minute) The number of pages per minute your application serves. private location A Synthetic monitor feature that allows you to run Synthetic monitors from within your own systems by creating private minions. Private locations allow you to extend your Synthetic coverage to new geographical locations, and to monitor websites behind your firewall such as an intranet site. For more information, see Private locations overview. recovery period A recovery period of time begins when a data source enters a non-violating state after being in a violating state. The recovery period is set in the condition's threshold. A violation will close when a source remains in a non-violating state and the recovery period time has elapsed. If the data source enters a violating state before the time has elapsed, the recovery period clock will reset and the violation won't close. response time The duration of time between a request for service and a response. For more information, see Response time. restricted user A type of user role on a New Relic account. For more information, see Users. rollup Using the same application name for multiple applications. This allows you to combine data in APM, either from multiple applications, or from multiple instances of an application. For more information, see Rolling up app data. root span For distributed tracing, the root span is the first span in a trace. In many cases, the root span duration will represent the duration of the entire trace, or be very close to it. However, for more complex, modern systems that use a lot of asynchronous, non-blocking processes, this will not be true. For those systems, the root span’s duration may be significantly less than the duration of the trace. RPM The term RPM usually refers to the number of requests per minute your application receives from users. This is usually the same as CPM (calls per minute). Historically, some New Relic monitoring solutions, like APM and Browser Monitoring, used to contain RPM in the URL; for example, https://rpm.newrelic.com. This language use originally referred to Rails performance management because the first iteration of our product monitored Ruby on Rails applications. We monitor many more languages and systems than Ruby now. RUM (real user monitoring) See page load timing. runbook A runbook contains standard procedures and operations typically used by system administrators, network operations staff, and other personnel to handle outages, alert incidents, and other situations. If your organization stores runbook instructions as URLs, you can link this information to an alerts policy so your personnel has easy access to this information when an incident violates the defined policy thresholds. SAML (Security Assertion Markup Language) SAML is an XML-based data format for sharing authentication data between two parties. New Relic accounts must obtain a SAML certificate in order to enable Single Sign On for their users. For more information, see SAML service providers. Selenium Selenium is an open-source browser testing suite. Synthetics uses Selenium to test monitored websites with real browsers. For more information, see monitor types. service A service is a cluster of runtime server processes that accomplish a particular task, usually service requests. Unlike an application, a service is not usually invoked by a human. New Relic offers a variety of integrations that allow you to report data from your services. signal The stream of telemetry data that's watched and alerted on. You use NRQL queries to define a signal. signal filter When we receive data and it's routed to the streaming alerts platform, your NRQL WHERE clause will filter the data coming in. The filtered streaming data is what's evaluated for loss of signal violations, for example. span In a distributed trace, a span is a \"named, timed operation representing a contiguous segment of work in that trace\" (from OpenTracing.io definition). For distributed tracing, spans are displayed in the distributed tracing UI, and the data type Span is available to be queried. See also root span. SSL certificate SSL certificates encrypt data that is being transmitted. While New Relic refers to security certificates as SSL because it is a more commonly used term, all certificates adhere to industry standards for secure encryption in transit. SSO (single sign on) SSO (single sign on) allows you to manage user authentication in New Relic using an external SSO provider. For more information, see Setting up SSO. streaming algorithm This is what determines when the data in an aggregation window is processed. The streaming algorithm uses your server's clock time and the aggregation window size to trigger the alert evaluation process. sub-accounts See master account. Synthetic monitoring Synthetic monitoring allows you to monitor your website or API endpoint via automated, scriptable tools. Use free ping monitor to ensure your website is accessible, or expand your monitoring with browser monitors, which test your website with real browsers. Go further with scripting, to script browsers or API monitors for sophisticated testing. target A target is a resource or component monitored by a New Relic monitoring tool that has been identified in an alert condition. When the data source for that target crosses the defined critical threshold, we will open a violation. Depending on your policy's Incident preference setting, Alerts may create an incident record and send notifications through the defined channels. See also entity. tag Tags are key:value metadata added to monitored apps, hosts, dashboards, and other entities to help you organize your data at a high level. For details, see Tags. thresholds Thresholds are alert condition settings that define a violation. Threshold values include the value a data source must pass to trigger a violation and the time-related settings that define a violation; for example: Passing a certain value for at least x minutes Passing a certain value only once in x minutes While the data source passes a certain value, a degradation period starts. Likewise, when that data source stops passing a certain value, a recovery period starts. The durations of these two time periods are defined in the alert condition threshold settings. Thresholds have a required critical (red) threshold and an optional warning (yellow) threshold. In the UI, the entity's health status indicator will change to yellow or red when a threshold has been crossed and a violation will open. For more information, see Define thresholds. For an explanation of how thresholds relate to other basic Alerts concepts, see Concepts and workflow. throughput Throughput is a measurement of user activity for a monitored application. APM throughput and Browser Monitoring throughput are measured in different ways: APM: requests per minute (RPM) Browser: page views per minute (PPM) tier A tier can refer to how New Relic categorizes or visualizes the various agent language ecosystems that we support. For example: In APM, the color-coded categories that appear on your app's main Overview chart show response time spent in various functions, processes, or agents as tiers; for example, request queuing, garbage collection, Middleware, JVMs, etc. In New Relic labels, TIER can be used to define or classify the client-server architecture; for example, front-end and back-end tiers. \"Tier\" may sometimes be used to refer to our pricing editions. time picker By default the New Relic UI shows data for the past 30 minutes, ending now. To change the time window, use the time picker. time range A time range can refer to a length of time selected in the New Relic UI. New Relic displays a time range depending on the range you select using the time picker. timeslice data See metric timeslice data. trace A trace is a description of how a request travels through a system. Trace data helps you understand the performance of your system and diagnose problems. For more information on how we use trace data, see New Relic data types. traffic light See health status. transaction A transaction is defined as one logical unit of work in an application. This term primarily refers to server-side transactions monitored by APM. For more information, see documentation about web transactions and non-web transactions. The term transaction is also sometimes used in Browser Monitoring. In that case, it primarily refers to activity beginning with a browser-side web request and ending with a complete page load. transaction trace A transaction trace is a complete picture of a single transaction, down to the database queries and exact invocation patterns. With transaction traces, New Relic gives you much deeper visibility into a single slow transaction, which can help you understand a broader problem. For more information, see Transaction traces. UI The New Relic user interface. For more information, see Standard page functions. user A user can refer to a specific user role in a New Relic account. For more information, see Users. UTC Universal Time Coordinated (UTC), or Coordinated Universal Time, is a standard timestamp for synchronizing time around the world. value function (metrics) The numeric value obtained from metric timeslice data; for example, an average, minimum, maximum, total, sample size, etc. violation A violation occurs when the entity monitored by an alert condition reports a value that crosses the thresholds defined in that condition. For an explanation of how violations relate to other basic alerts concepts, see Concepts and workflow. You can view a summary of the violations for a selected incident's page. You can also view the violations for a specific entity from the product's UI. web external Web external is the term applied to the portion of time spent in transactions to external applications from within the code of the application you are monitoring. That time can be a call to a third party company (a payment provider, for example) or it could be a call to another microservice within your own company. Web external demonstrates how performance is impacted by your code executing outside the application you are measuring. web transaction A transaction is defined as one logical unit of work in an application. This term primarily refers to server-side transactions monitored by APM. Web transactions are initiated with an HTTP request. For most organizations, these represent customer-centric interactions and thus are the most important transactions to monitor. For more information, see Web transactions and Non-web transactions. WebDriverJS WebDriver is a Selenium component, used to control Synthetics scripted browsers. Specifically, Synthetics uses WebDriverJS, a Node.js-based flavor of Selenium. For more information, see Writing scripted browsers and Scripted browser examples. workload A workload represents a group of entities that work together to provide a digital service. For more information, see Workloads.",

      "body": "New Relic's global data hosting structure consists of two regions: the European Union (EU) region and the United States (US) region. Selecting your preferred region during the account setup process allows you to specify the region where your performance monitoring data will be hosted. You can also create accounts in each region. Requirements Access to the New Relic EU region requires the latest agent version. For new customers: Install the most recent agent version. For existing customers: Update to the most recent agent version. Minimum agent version required: C SDK 1.0.0 or higher Go 2.0.0 or higher Java 4.0.0 or higher .NET 8.0.0 or higher Node.js 3.0.0 or higher PHP 8.0.0.204 or higher Python 3.0.0.89 or higher Ruby 5.0.0.342 or higher Regions and availability Your choice of data center is not limited by your geographic location. You can choose to create an account with data hosted in either the EU or US region, regardless of where you or your systems reside. You can also create accounts in each region. New Relic offers almost all the same active products, features, support offerings, and performance levels in the EU region as what is offered in the US region. Exceptions: The following are not supported with an EU region account: Infinite Tracing is not available. APM's weekly performance reports are not available. Errors inbox is not available. Log patterns Deprecated products and features are not available. New Relic's Incident Intelligence service operates solely in the US whether you store your data in New Relic’s US region data center or New Relic’s EU region data center, by using New Relic Incident Intelligence, you consent that New Relic may move and store your data in the US region. New Relic CodeStream operates solely in the US. Whether you have selected New Relic's US or EU region data center during setup of your New Relic account, when using New Relic CodeStream, you consent that your New Relic CodeStream data will get stored in the US. Regions and account hierarchy You can create accounts in each region. If your data is currently being hosted in the US region, you must create a new account to store data in the EU region. You cannot view EU data from a US account, or US data from an EU account. The data collected remains separate. The data cannot be aggregated or migrated between accounts. For organizations that have a parent/child account structure, you can only have one parent account. For more, see Manage apps or users with child accounts. For partnership accounts, no changes to the partnership owner account are required. However, data cannot be shared across regions, so a partnership requires a parent account for each region. Hierarchy example for partnership accounts With partnership accounts, a new parent account must be created for any data to be host in the EU region. This hierarchy illustrates how global accounts are structured with partnership owner accounts. Data is not aggregated beyond the parent account. Example hierarchy for partnership organizations. Because data cannot be shared across regions, a partnership will require a parent account for each region. Create an EU region account To create a New Relic account in the EU region: Go to the New Relic signup page. OR If you have a specific offer from a New Relic partner, follow that link directly. Follow the online steps to create your account. From the Select your region dropdown, select European Union. Agree to the Terms of Service. When you receive an email confirmation message, select the link to confirm your account and sign in to New Relic. Then install or update to the most recent agent version. API endpoints for EU region accounts If you have an EU region account, use the appropriate endpoints to access the following New Relic APIs: API EU endpoint Browser source maps API sourcemaps.service. eu .newrelic.com Copy Infrastructure Alert API infra-api. eu .newrelic.com Copy Dashboard API rpm. eu .newrelic.com/api/explore/dashboards/list Copy Insert API insights-collector. eu01 .nr-data.net Copy Insights Query API insights-api. eu .newrelic.com Copy Mobile apps rpm. eu .newrelic.com/mobile Copy NerdGraph GraphiQL API api. eu .newrelic.com/graphiql Copy Partner API The partner API is a global API with no regional data differences.

Billing and pricing New Relic's account billing process and pricing options are the same for both the EU and US regions. Operational access and processing Customer Data is hosted in the region selected during account creation. Systems Operations Data is stored in the US region. All other information, including account information (such as license subscription information, billing, and internal monitoring) is hosted in the US region and replicated in the EU region. New Relic may access and process Customer Data in the United States and such other jurisdictions where New Relic has affiliates and subsidiaries, including as may be necessary to maintain, secure, or perform the services, to provide technical support, or as necessary to comply with law or a binding order of a government body. Customer Data from existing New Relic accounts cannot be transferred or shared across regions, and new data generated cannot be shared with existing accounts, even in partnership accounts. Verify your account is based in EU region Use either of these options to verify whether your account data is hosted in the EU region's data center: In APM, mouse over the application name to view the URL.

      "body": "A DevOps transformation requires a cultural shift so that teams can build new skills and motivations for the type of cross-team work required in a true DevOps practice. The transformation can be difficult when the people involved do not see the benefits of change as a clear objective. Service level objectives (SLOs) provide a powerful mechanism to codify the goals of a DevOps team in a way that can be measured and shared. They also provide clear boundaries on service expectations that help teams achieve greater velocity and freedom in experimenting with new approaches. This tutorial defines SLOs for successful service delivery objectives and utilize New Relic instrumentation to surface the current performance metrics relative to those objectives. Measurable SLOs and visibility into your current progress against those SLOs ensure that you will be able to properly assess future optimization efforts. Service level components An SLO is an agreed upon means of measuring the performance of your service. The SLO defines a target value of a specified quantitative measure, which is called a service level indicator (SLI); for example: Average response time Response time percentile Application availability SLOs clarify a target value for SLIs; for example: Average response time should be less than 200 ms 95% of requests should be completed within 250 ms Availability of the service should be 99.99% Logically group SLOs together to provide an overall boolean indicator of whether or not the service is meeting expectations. For example, a helpful SLO for alerting purposes could be: 95% of requests completed within 250 ms AND availability is 99.99% Copy Service level components Example values SLI (Indicator) HTTP status codes SLO (Objective) < 1% HTTP 500s over 30 days SLA (Agreement) For every additional .1% of HTTP 500s, 5% refund of total contract Resources Value stream mapping can be a useful exercise to work through before setting SLOs. Work with your teams to clarify key components of your service and the appropriate metrics. Use these inputs as starting points for this tutorial. In addition: Learn about SLOs, SLIs, and SLAs from the Google Cloud Platform blog. Learn how New Relic has applied SLOs and SLIs into its reliability practices form this SREcon18 Americas presentation (approximately 21 minutes). 1. Build an inventory of services requiring SLOs Start defining SLOs for your application by first taking an inventory of the services that your application provides to both your internal and external customers. Draft a list of services. Make the scope of services you consider as comprehensive as possible. Engage your team members and other stakeholders to validate the list for completeness. Segment your application stack to understand the potential components that might require SLOs. For example, most applications can be segmented as: Application (backend/microservices) Dependency services (such as the message queue) Database Website Underlying servers This example lists components that would benefit from SLOs: Customer type Component name Owner Language stack Operating system External Service 1 John D. Java RHEL 6 Internal Service 2 Jane A. .NET Win2003 R2 Internal ActiveMQ John D. Java AIX External Website Jane A. Classic ASP Win2000 Internal MS SQL Dave Z. n/a Win2003 R2 Building a definitive list of services that require an SLO can be challenging, because an application often consists of many endpoints with complex interdependencies. Begin your SLO journey with pragmatism. Start by defining a broader, simpler set of SLOs that are driven by what your customers care about most and what your team can control. As your teams better align around SLOs, you can then begin to fine-tune and add more complexity. 2. Research customer expectations for SLOs Once you have an inventory of services, begin to gather the information you need to define the SLOs for those services. Interviews with customers that depend on your services are often valuable for understanding service expectations. For example, to define SLOs for internal teams, New Relic, ask questions such as: If possible, can you broadly categorize the types of requests we can expect from you and your service? To what extent do you or your service depend on timely responses to requests? Are there requests for which response time is not critical? How does your service handle unavailable dependencies or data? What is the maximum amount of unavailable data that your service can handle? At what threshold does your service fail if a request takes too long? What are acceptable rates of errors? What would a SLA look like between our product and yours? Existing usage data can also be a helpful research input. 3. Define SLOs Using the research on customer expectations that you gathered, draft a focused set of SLOs. New Relic recommends setting SLOs against one or more of the following SLIs: Application availability percentage Average response time Response percentile Error rate Apdex value Also, consider instrumenting and tracking the following SLIs: Throughput (peak and trough) Database call count and duration DNS and SSL timing DOM processing and page rendering Mean-time-to-detection (MTTD) For a more comprehensive list of potential areas to measure, see Measuring DevOps. Recommendation: To determine if your application is performing to customer expectations: Consider combining multiple SLIs (for example, availability and response time) into one SLO. Aim to define a consistent set of conditions across all of the services in your list. Consult your team and stakeholders to validate that the SLOs you set are reasonable, consistently attainable (even if you are not currently meeting them), and aligned to customer expectations. After you finish this step, you should have a set of well-defined SLOs and SLIs. 4. Determine what can be instrumented Now you're ready to deploy agents or monitors to establish a performance baseline for the SLIs you created. With proper instrumentation in place, you'll have visibility into the performance indicators that matter for your team and your customers. In addition, you'll also have a clear understanding of how to meet your SLOs. Identify the service components your team will optimize. Verify which application tiers meet New Relic monitoring requirements. To ensure you have robust baselines from which to work, determine the level of instrumentation that is possible (or allowed) within your organization. It's best practice to instrument everything you can, but there may be situations where instrumentation isn't viable. In that case, you should determine what other data is available or can be created. For example, you can gather logs to query them for SLO data and set alerts for them. one.newrelic.com > Logs: Use the New Relic log management UI to leverage your logs. If the application has a web front end in these situations, use New Relic synthetic monitors. Our synthetic monitors offer non-agent monitoring while still providing the ability to establish a baseline. To instrument the example applications and components in this tutorial, use these New Relic features: New Relic products Customer type Component name Tier owner Language stack Server OS New Relic products External Service 1 John D. Java RHEL 6 APM, infrastructure monitoring, synthetic monitors Internal Service 2 Jane A. .Net Win2003 R2 APM, infrastructure monitoring Internal ActiveMQ John D. Java AIX APM External Website Jane A. Classic ASP Win2000 Synthetic monitors Internal MS SQL Dave Z. NA Win2003 R2 Infrastructure monitoring, on-host integrations APM installation After reviewing the compatibility and requirements for APM, install an APM agent on your application stack. Steps for installing APM agents vary based on language agent type. Follow the install procedures for a specific APM agents. Infrastructure installation After reviewing the requirements for New Relic infrastructure monitoring, follow the install procedures to install the infrastructure agent on instances that host your applications. The infrastructure agent requires the following host permissions: Linux: To install and run the agent, you must have root privileges. Windows: To install and run the agent, you must have Administrator privileges. Infrastructure on-host integrations To gain extended visibility into applications that your code depends on, deploy on-host integrations based on their availability. New Relic supports several commonly used application components, including MySQL, Apache, NGINX, and more. For more information, see our on-host integration docs. Synthetics New Relic synthetic monitoring gives you a suite of automated, scriptable tools to monitor your websites, critical business transactions, and API endpoints. Follow the procedures to create a simple browser check. Be sure to verify that your website URL is accessible from the Synthetics public network locations. Browser monitoring New Relic browser monitoring provides deep insights into how your users are interacting with your application or website. Browser monitoring complements synthetic monitors with data based on actual user experiences, which is useful in discerning how DevOps efforts are ultimately improving the experience for the customer. For more information, see the compatibility and requirements, then install the New Relic browser agent. Mobile monitoring The growing role of mobile apps in customer experience often spurs new performance data needs. Installation of New Relic mobile monitoring lets DevOps teams instrument iOS and Android applications to gain a fuller understanding of service delivery quality. 5. Review the default metrics After you deploy the agents and monitors, use service maps to review the default metrics that New Relic captures. For example, a typical service map show many of the common SLIs that application teams rely on, including response time, Apdex, throughput, and error rate metrics from APM. It also shows page load time, Ajax response, throughput, and error rate from browser monitoring. rpm.newrelic.com > Service maps: To explore detailed granularity for any area, use the service map's nodes. 6. Set up custom instrumentation To close any remaining gaps in visibility for your SLIs, use custom instrumentation. New Relic provides several avenues for adding custom instrumentation, including: Making API calls to agents from inside your source code Packaging XML-based custom instrumentation modules with deployed applications Adding UI-based instrumentation without a code deploy In addition, you can add custom attributes to each transaction event that match application performance factors to critical business information. Then you can track those attributes in Insights dashboards. For more information, see the custom instrumentation documentation for your application: APM Browser Infrastructure Mobile Synthetics 7. Create dashboards to track SLIs Once you implement the appropriate instrumentation, it's easy to visualize your service level indicators with New Relic dashboards, which provide a single location to query and view all the data that New Relic tools gather. To learn more about how to run queries to produce charts and dashboards, see Introduction to query builder. For more about the data you can query, see New Relic data types. The metrics you capture will become your application's baseline. Share dashboards with your application team and stakeholders to provide visibility into what is happening with your application and to monitor future performance.",

      "body": "In a DevOps world, a deep understanding of customer expectations and your progress in meeting those expectations is vital to providing stability, maintaining goodwill with your users, and increasing business value. With New Relic you can measure the success of your DevOps initiatives and learn how to identify, resolve, and decrease any gaps in your DevOps performance. In this tutorial, you’ll gather key service delivery stakeholders to assess your team's progress against service level objectives (SLOs) and service level agreements (SLAs), while facilitating further optimizations. Prerequisites This tutorial assumes you’ve completed the Establish objectives and baseline tutorial. 1. Assemble a cross-functional team to review service delivery The first (and most important step) is assembling the right team. Identify the proper stakeholders and representatives to play active parts in the operations review process. This team should be comprised of individuals who develop applications, work with service delivery, maintain your ecosystem, and resolve problems for customers. While operations review teams often focus on technical members, the best teams have broad representation across the company, including representatives from Business Operations, Marketing, and Support. These cross-functional teams help ensure that the service delivery process is strongly integrated with customer expectations. If you can specifically identify how technical improvements meet customer expectations and positively impact the business’s bottom line, then your operations team is functioning at optimal levels. Tip Ideally, the cross-functional operations review team should also be the team that defines your SLOs. If this is not possible, try to ensure that some members of the operations review team are also on the team responsible for SLOs. 2. Review service records and note key metrics Create a regular meeting to track your service records. New Relic recommends reviewing your previous service records, and pinpointing specific metrics to analyze at every review. For example, start with application state, alert conditions, and runtime anomalies. Look at the same metrics on two separate occasions to identify and assess patterns, inconsistencies, and anomalies. Monitor these metrics using the service delivery Insights dashboards you created in the Establish objectives and baselines tutorial. The widgets on these dashboards provide a high-level overview of the relationships between different performance indicators and baselines: insights.newrelic.com > (select a dashboard): Use dashboards to visualize metrics related to service delivery. When conducting a thorough performance review, make several dashboards that have corresponding widgets. Use these dashboards to hone-in on two specific time periods that you want to compare. This comparative analysis could cover everything from Infrastructure or browser performance, to Synthetics testing or business impact. To get started with performance indicators in Insights, read the following example queries. These queries provide information that you can consider incorporating for the operations review. Daily uptime SELECT percentage(count(result), where result = 'SUCCESS') from SyntheticCheck since 1 Day ago Copy Create dashboards that are dedicated to the functionality that drives your software development process, such as testing. For example, collect related metrics on uptime, types of monitors, geo-locations, and other data points that are required for appropriately measuring SLAs. The following dashboard provides such an example: insights.newrelic.com > (select a dashboard): Track your relevant SLAs together in one dashboard.

Dashboards that give a brief overview of performance across your entire application stack are invaluable for cross-functional team reviews. Tip Beyond Insights, the APM reports allow you to see how you’re performing on a daily, weekly, and monthly basis with built in SLA reports and other detailed reports. The out-of-the-box details from these reports give your operations team a launch pad for conversations about progress against objectives and overall performance. 3. Summarize events related to application alerts, downtime, and errors Now that you’ve gathered data about your service delivery, the next step is to dive deeper into specific incidents that warrant further investigation or surface a need for broader team action. For example, notable downtime and errors are key areas to investigate as a team. After completing the Setup proactive alerting tutorial, you can explore notifications of violations as they occur. Once these violations are brought to your attention, acknowledge the specific incident and have an ongoing record of both opened and closed incidents. Use the incident reports as a focal point for discussion of gaps. alerts.newrelic.com > Incidents: Identify performance issues and SLA gaps with New Relic Alerts incident reports. Ultimately, it’s important to solicit feedback from the cross-functional team on the causes of the incidents to determine how you can improve service delivery processes to prevent reoccurrences. One approach might be to focus on one or two notable incidents, use the New Relic UI to walk through the data points leading up to those incidents, and assess the actions that occurred. Summarize the incident and the cross-functional feedback on causes and potential solutions as succinctly as possible. Over time, you’ll notice patterns that will require deeper action.",

      "body": "The term alerting often carries some negative connotations: many developers correlate alerting with errors, mistakes, and ongoing issues. However, developers who are proactive about alerting, know they don't have to stare at dashboards all day because effective alerts tell them when to check in. Well-defined alerts help you understand the health of your systems, so you can respond to performance problems before they affect your customers. Further, a focused alerts policy helps you pinpoint any degradation that could impact performance in your application or environment. With proactive alerting, you'll decrease user-reported incidents, and your teams will spend less time firefighting and more time deploying significant changes to your product. After you define the right alerts, proper incident orchestration aligns your teams, tools, and processes to prepare for incidents and outages in your software. The goal is to provide your teams a predictable framework and process to: Maximize efficiency in communication and effort. Minimize the overall impact to your business. Prerequisites This tutorial assumes you have: Instrumented your applications in New Relic. Reviewed the Establish objectives and baselines tutorial. Optionally added custom attributes and events. 1. Define policies Define required alerting policies based on SLOs. A service level objective (SLO) is an agreed upon means of measuring the performance of your service. The SLO defines a target value of a specified quantitative measure, which is called a service level indicator (SLI). Examples of service level indicators could be average response time, response time percentile, and application availability. SLOs would then clarify a target value for those SLIs such as: Average response time should be less than 200 ms. 95% of requests should be completed within 250 ms. Availability of the service should be 99.99%. These SLOs can also be logically grouped together to provide an overall boolean indicator of whether the service is meeting expectations or not (for example, 95% of requests completed within 250 ms AND availability is 99.99%), which can be helpful for alerting purposes. Use these SLIs as key performance indicators (KPIs) so your team and organization can measure your service and ensure it's meeting customer expectations. By breaking down the quantitative performance metrics that are required of your services, you can then identify what kinds of alerts you should set for each. For instance, you could set an alert to notify you if web transaction times go above half a millisecond, or if the error rate goes higher than 0.20%. However, not every SLO needs to become an alert. A strong alerting strategy takes SLOs and creates a set of simple, actionable alerts. New Relic often finds that our most mature customers set fewer alerts in general and focus those alerts on a core set of metrics that indicate when their customer experience is truly degraded. As a result, New Relic customers often use Apdex as part of their alerting strategy to align alerts with signs of degraded user satisfaction. As you design your alerting strategy, keep this question in mind: “If the customer isn’t impacted, is it worth waking someone up?” Example questions and KPI solutions For a simple framework of areas to set alerts for, use the following questions and advised metrics and KPIs: Questions Metrics and KPIs Are we open for business? Use browser monitoring and APM to alert on site availability. How's our underlying infrastructure? Set KPIs for key hardware, network, and storage components. How's the health of our application? Track metrics for JVM performance, queuing, caching, and similar dependencies. How’s the overall quality of our application? Use an Apdex score to quickly access an application’s quality. How are our customers doing? Consider real end-user metrics (browser or APM), synthetic users (Synthetics), and Apdex scores. How's our overall business doing? Focus on key transactions within an application, and tie them to expected business outcomes to illustrate correlation between your application and business performance. 2. Set specific alerts Set specific alerts for performance, correctness, throughput, availability, and dependencies With New Relic you can set alerts on your instrumented applications, end-user experience, infrastructure, databases, and more. New Relic will alert you if your site's availability dips or if your error rate spikes above acceptable levels, as defined by your SLOs. You can set warning thresholds to monitor issues that may be approaching a critical severity but don't yet warrant a pager notification. Setting thresholds for when alerts should notify teams can be challenging. Thresholds that are too tight will create alert fatigue while thresholds that are too loose will lead to unhappy customers. Baseline alerts allow you to set dynamic thresholds for alerts based on historical performance. Use baselines to tune your alert to the right threshold. For example, an alert in APM can notify incident response teams if web transaction times deviate from historical performance for an allotted amount of time. alerts.newrelic.com > (selected alert policy) > (selected alert condition) > Define thresholds You can set this same kind of alert in browser to catch sub-optimal performance. In the following example, we've set both a warning and a violation for throughput: alerts.newrelic.com > (selected alert policy) > (selected alert condition) > Define thresholds As you develop smaller, independent services running on increasingly ephemeral architectures, your environments become significantly more complex. Visibility into outliers can be an important tool for understanding likely performance issues. You should set alerts to automatically fire when you have an outlier, which can indicate misbehaving hosts, load balancers, or apps. For example, a load balancer divides web traffic across five different servers. You can set an alert based on a NRQL query and receive a notification if any server starts getting significantly more or less traffic than the other servers. Here is an example chart: And here's a sample NRQL query: SELECT average(cpuPercent) FROM SystemSample WHERE apmApplicationNames = 'MY-APP-NAME' FACET hostname Copy Now you have set static, baseline, and outlier alerts. This can provide a comprehensive awareness of your ecosystem. Refer to the New Relic Alerts documentation for more details about optimizing your alerts. 3. Identify groups Identify groups to alert, set broadcasting methods, and assign first responders to team dashboards Alerting without the proper broadcasting methods leaves you vulnerable. Your alerting strategy should include a notification channel to ensure the appropriate teams are notified if your application or architecture encounters issues. New Relic has many notification integrations, but we recommend that you start simple and add more complexity later. We recommend that you first send alerts to a group chat channel (for example, using Slack or PagerDuty). Evaluate these alerts in real time for several weeks to understand which alerts are indicative of important or problematic issues. These are the types of alerts that warrant waking someone up. Recommendation: For each team dashboard, make sure: It has an owner who assumes responsibility for the health of the applications and features it monitors. There is no ambiguity about who is responsible for attending to and resolving an alert condition. This policy will vary between organizations depending on size, structure, and culture. For example, some teams may prefer to assign dashboards and alerts based on de-facto features or application ownership. Other teams may prefer to adopt an on-call rotation (often referred to as pager duty). In on-call rotations, designated team members handle all first-line incident responses, and they resolve or delegate responsibilities based on predetermined incident thresholds. 4. Determine thresholds Determine incident thresholds for alert conditions For each of your applications: Identify the thresholds for what is officially considered an incident. Make sure each set of threshold criteria is context-dependent. Document incident evaluation and known remediation procedures in runbooks. Include links to your runbooks when you define conditions and thresholds for your alert policies. For instance, a certain alert condition may be dismissable during low-traffic periods but require active remediation during peak hours. 5. Set notification channels Ensure alerts have auditable notification channels Make sure that communications during critical incidents take place in easily accessible and highly visible channels. A group chat room dedicated to incident communication is usually a great choice. This allows all stakeholders to participate or observe and provides a chronology of notifications, key decisions, and actions for postmortem analysis. Use any of the available notification channels in New Relic Alerts. For example, to set up a notification channel in Slack: Make sure your organization has completed New Relic's integration requirements with Slack. In the Slack app, select the dropdown in the top-left corner of the app, and select Customize Slack. Click Configure apps. From the list of app integrations, select New Relic. Expand the instructions for New Relic Alerts, and follow the steps to configure notifications from New Relic. 6. Automate resolution Automate triage and resolution steps Automation of simple or repeatable incident response tasks will increase efficiency and minimize the impact of incidents. With proper automation in place, you can disable or isolate faulty application components as soon as an alert threshold is reached, rather than after a notification has been issued. For example, a team managing an application for a digital media company wants to be able to remove commenting abilities from the website if the system has errors. In this case, they could: Add an endpoint to their front-end web application that will toggle a feature flag enabling or disabling the UI components associated with posting comments on an article. Create an alert policy with a threshold set on the sustained error rate in the commenting service. Assign a webhook notification channel that will send a POST request to this endpoint, as well as to the standard team notification channels. In this scenario, errors in the commenting system will trigger the webhook and remove the commenting UI from the website. Users can still use core functionality of the site without seeing errors generated by the commenting service. The application will maintain a stable but degraded state, allowing the team to focus on recovery without the pressure of preventing users from accessing the site. You can also use webhooks to create issues and action items in ticketing systems that have REST APIs, such as Zendesk. Use New Relic Alerts to create a webhook notification channel, and customize the webhook payload as needed. 7. Establish reviews Establish a post mortem process After the incident has been resolved, key stakeholders and participants must capture accurate and thorough documentation of the incident. At a minimum, we recommend that the retro documentation includes: A root cause analysis A chronology and summary of remediation steps and their result, whether they were successful or not A measure of the impact to the business in terms of user experience and financial losses, if possible Recommendations for system or feature improvements to prevent a recurrence Recommendations for process and communication improvements Store post mortem reports in a highly visible, searchable repository, such as a shared drive folder or wiki. Culturally, it's essential that this process focuses on constructive learning and improvement rather than punishment or blame. Example post mortem report Here is a brief example of a post mortem report: Post mortem Comments Date March 1, 2018 Executive summary From approximately 1:45PM until 2:30PM, users could not add items to their carts, which prevented any checkouts from occurring during the incident period. Root cause We determined that a change was made to the CSS rules on the product detail page that effectively disabled the Add to cart button. Timeline 1:50PM: Successful checkouts < 10 for 5 minutes alert triggered; assigned to Alice. 1:55PM: After reviewing the ecommerce team dashboard, Alice determined that the threshold was breached immediately following a deploy by Bob. She notified him of the incident. 2:00PM: Alice and Bob began troubleshooting. Attempts at recreating the issue in production were successful. 2:20PM: Bob determined that his change to the CSS on the product detail page disabled the Add to cart button. He deployed a hotfix. 2:30PM: Functionality was restored and the incident was resolved. Impact No checkouts were completed during the duration of the incident. Our typical revenue for a Thursday during this timeframe is $30,000. Recommendations We have been discussing implementing New Relic Synthetics for awhile now. If we had a Synthetic check on the checkout process, this issue would have been detected immediately. We should also implement more thorough unit tests in the front-end web app. 8. Fine-tune process Fine-tune alerts and thresholds As you use New Relic to optimize your application and infrastructure performance, tighten your New Relic Alerts policy conditions to keep pace with your improved performance. When rolling out new code or modifications that could negatively impact performance over a period of time, loosen your threshold conditions to allow for these short-term changes. For instance, we recommend using pre-established baselines and thresholds to increase efficiency during high-impact times for your business, such as annual events and major releases. Fine-tuning gives you the flexibility you need to increase efficiencies and extend your notification channels. As noted earlier, we recommend you start with a group chat service when you first establish notifications. Once you've identified other tools you'd like to integrate with, set up a notification channel to maintain your momentum. Tools such as xMatters and PagerDuty provide popular integrations, but don't overlook simple methods, such as webhooks. The goal is to continuously improve your alerting scheme. Be sure to check your alerts and confirm that they're firing regularly and are still relevant for your customer satisfaction metrics. Use the New Relic platform to create dashboards centered around alerts and incidents for the most common policy conditions and violations. insights.newrelic.com > All dashboards > (selected dashboard) Use the New Relic query language and the Insights query API to create your dashboards. The dashboard above was created using the following NRQL queries. It's recommended you recreate them as needed for your alerting dashboards. Incidents by condition: SELECT count(*) FROM ALERT_NAME WHERE current_state = 'open' FACET condition_name SINCE 1 week ago Copy Incidents by policy: SELECT count(*) FROM ALERT_NAME where current_state = 'open' FACET policy_name SINCE 60 MINUTES AGO TIMESERIES Copy Alert trends over time: SELECT count(*) FROM ALERT_NAME WHERE current_state IS NOT NULL FACET policy_name SINCE 1 week ago TIMESERIES Copy Incident details: SELECT timestamp, incident_id, policy_name, condition_name, details, severity FROM ALERT_NAME SINCE 1 week ago LIMIT 40 Copy Visualizing this data provides a resource you can share with others to refine the alerts and thresholds you're using. Expert tip In addition to instrumenting and measuring application and infrastructure metrics, mature DevOps organizations often measure and optimize the efficiency of incident response processes. For example, you can use webhooks to send alert events to New Relic Insights. This allows you to supplement your team dashboards with New Relic Alerts data.",
