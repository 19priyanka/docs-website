      "body": "Mobile monitoring for Android monitors your mobile app, giving you a comprehensive view of your app's performance. It works for Android apps written using Java or Kotlin. Install the Android agent Before you install the Android agent, make sure your app follows the compatibility requirements. As part of the installation process, mobile monitoring automatically generates an application token. This is a 40-character hexadecimal string for authenticating each mobile app that you monitor. Follow the Android installation and configuration procedures for your environment as applicable. If you have problems with your Android installation, or if you do not see data in the mobile monitoring UI for your Android app, follow the troubleshooting procedures. Extend your instrumentation After you install the agent, extend the agent's instrumentation by using the mobile monitoring UI and following up on information in New Relic Insights. To access: In mobile monitoring: In NRQL and dashboards: Custom data Create and record custom events, interaction traces, and attributes to add details to your existing data and traces. Then, view the custom events that you created in NRQL or dashboards. Network requests Enable the MobileRequest event feature so you can perform a full network analysis. To further investigate network request error rates and response times, query MobileRequest and MobileRequestError events. Crash analysis Review detailed information using groups and filters to analyze trends that lead to crashes. To view more information about crashes, create NRQL queries to review Insights charts related to crash data. Android SDK API Use the Android SDK API for mobile monitoring to instrument parts of your code that are not instrumented by default. Then, view those custom events and attributes in New Relic Insights. Handled exceptions Report exceptions so you can identify factors creating a poor mobile app experience. To further improve performance, review MobileHandledException event records in New Relic Insights. Breadcrumbs Boost the level of detail in crash event trails by adding breadcrumbs. Then, query MobileBreadcrumbs events to see all breadcrumbs or just breadcrumbs related to crashes. See your errors in CodeStream You can also see your Android application's directly in your IDE using CodeStream and errors inbox. To do this, install CodeStream, connect CodeStream and New Relic and create Git tags that match your appVersion.",

      "body": "Important Starting with version 5.9.0 of the New Relic Android agent, you can set a custom user identifier value to associate user sessions with analytics events and attributes. For more information, see the NewRelic.setUserId method. The Android agent provides an SDK API to set up custom instrumentation for monitoring your application. The API gives you the ability to: Instrument your own code. Create, name, and end interaction traces from events in your mobile app. Record custom metrics. Send custom attributes and events to New Relic Insights. Track networking from libraries not supported automatically. Install the SDK Before using the Android SDK API: Review the Android SDK API release notes to ensure you have your app instrumented with a current SDK for mobile monitoring. Go to one.newrelic.com, click Add more data and then follow the steps for Android. For more information, see the detailed Android installation and configuration procedures. If you need to support Android 2.2, see the legacy Android agent SDK procedures. Instrument your code Caution Tracing is heavily optimized, but it does impose a performance overhead. Avoid instrumenting methods that are expected to be called hundreds of times. If you have custom libraries or application code that you want to include in interaction traces: Use the following Java annotation: import com.newrelic.agent.android.instrumentation.Trace; Copy Add the @Trace annotation to the methods you want to instrument: @Trace public void myHeavyweightMethod() { … Copy To indicate what kind of method is being traced, use the optional category attribute. Automatically instrumented methods Automatic instrumentation is one of the agent's more convenient features. However, if it interferes with the method being traced, add @SkipTrace to the method, and the agent will skip it during compile time instrumentation.

Record network failures: See noticeNetworkFailure. Record a handled exception as an event, including context See recordHandledException(). Manual cross application tracing The noticeHttpTransaction code does not automatically append the appropriate header ID value needed to get cross application tracing to work. This is why you will not see the application link in your Android app on New Relic's Map page for mobile apps or on the HTTP requests page. You can use a public method in the New Relic Android SDK to get the appropriate ID to pass along with your HTTP request to your back-end application, as long as it is already instrumented by New Relic. The appropriate header ID will be passed from the back-end application in the response, providing everything needed for cross application tracing to function. Cross application tracing example This example adds the NewRelic-ID to the back-end HTTP request, with conn as the external HTTP connection. (Notice the additional import.) import com.newrelic.agent.android.NewRelic; import com.newrelic.agent.android.Agent; //required for getCrossProcessId() ... ... //new method for appending the crossProcessID necessary for CAT in New Relic public static void setCrossProcessHeader(HttpURLConnection conn) { String crossProcessId = Agent.getCrossProcessId(); // API call into the agent for the X-NewRelic-ID if (crossProcessId != null) { conn.setRequestProperty(\"X-NewRelic-ID\", crossProcessId); } } Copy After adding the appropriate header to the request to the back-end app, the response from the app needs to be parsed for the X-Newrelic-App-Data header, and then added to the noticeHttpTransaction call as a string. For example: //NewRelic.noticeHttpTransaction(url, httpMethod, statusCode, startTimeMs, endTimeMs, bytesSent, bytesReceived, responseBody, params, response); //Where xNewRelicAppDataHeader is the value of the X-NewRelic-App-Data header NewRelic.noticeHttpTransaction(\"http://api.newrelic.com\", \"GET\", 200, System.nanoTime(), System.nanoTime(),100 ,100, \"Test\", new HashMap<String, String>(), xNewRelicAppDataHeader); Copy",

Requirements Compatible with all agent versions. Description The New Relic Android SDK API provides several methods to track network requests. If a network request fails, you can record details about the failure with noticeNetworkFailure. In most cases, place this call inside exception handlers, such as catch blocks. For general info on using the New Relic Android SDK API, see the usage guide. Parameters Parameter Description NewRelic.noticeNetworkFailure(string $url, string $httpMethod, long $startTime, long $endTime, exception $exception OR $networkFailure) Copy $url string Required. The URL of the request. $httpMethod string Required. The HTTP method used, such as GET or POST. $startTime long Required. The start time of the request in milliseconds since the epoch. $endTime long Required. The end time of the request in milliseconds since the epoch. $exception string Either this or $failure parameter is required. This is the exception that occurred. New Relic can automatically translate many common exceptions into network failure types. $failure enum Either this or $exception parameter is required. The type of network failure that occurred. If an exception cannot be resolved to a network failure automatically, this method can be used to categorize the failure accurately. The values are defined by the NetworkFailure enum. Valid values include Unknown, BadURL, TimedOut, CannotConnectToHost, DNSLookupFailed, BadServerResponse, and SecureConnectionFailed. Examples Record network failure Here’s an example of an error listener that uses an error as part of the noticed network failure to New Relic: new Response.ErrorListener() { @Override public void onErrorResponse(Error error) { NewRelic.noticeNetworkFailure(badUrl, \"GET\", System.nanoTime(), System.nanoTime(), NetworkFailure.exceptionToNetworkFailure(error)); } Copy",

Requirements Compatible with all agent versions. Description The New Relic Android SDK API provides several methods to track network requests. If a network request fails, you can record details about the failure with noticeNetworkFailure. In most cases, place this call inside exception handlers, such as catch blocks. For general info on using the New Relic Android SDK API, see the usage guide. Parameters Parameter Description NewRelic.noticeNetworkFailure(string $url, string $httpMethod, long $startTime, long $endTime, exception $exception OR $networkFailure) Copy $url string Required. The URL of the request. $httpMethod string Required. The HTTP method used, such as GET or POST. $startTime long Required. The start time of the request in milliseconds since the epoch. $endTime long Required. The end time of the request in milliseconds since the epoch. $exception string Either this or $failure parameter is required. This is the exception that occurred. New Relic can automatically translate many common exceptions into network failure types. $failure enum Either this or $exception parameter is required. The type of network failure that occurred. If an exception cannot be resolved to a network failure automatically, this method can be used to categorize the failure accurately. The values are defined by the NetworkFailure enum. Valid values include Unknown, BadURL, TimedOut, CannotConnectToHost, DNSLookupFailed, BadServerResponse, and SecureConnectionFailed. Examples Record network failure Here’s an example of an error listener that uses an error as part of the noticed network failure to New Relic: new Response.ErrorListener() { @Override public void onErrorResponse(Error error) { NewRelic.noticeNetworkFailure(badUrl, \"GET\", System.nanoTime(), System.nanoTime(), NetworkFailure.exceptionToNetworkFailure(error)); } Copy",

Install the Android agent Before you install the Android agent, make sure your app follows the compatibility requirements. As part of the installation process, mobile monitoring automatically generates an application token. This is a 40-character hexadecimal string for authenticating each mobile app that you monitor. Follow the Android installation and configuration procedures for your environment as applicable. If you have problems with your Android installation, or if you do not see data in the mobile monitoring UI for your Android app, follow the troubleshooting procedures. Extend your instrumentation After you install the agent, extend the agent's instrumentation by using the mobile monitoring UI and following up on information in New Relic Insights. To access: In mobile monitoring: In NRQL and dashboards: Custom data Create and record custom events, interaction traces, and attributes to add details to your existing data and traces. Then, view the custom events that you created in NRQL or dashboards. Network requests Enable the MobileRequest event feature so you can perform a full network analysis. To further investigate network request error rates and response times, query MobileRequest and MobileRequestError events. Crash analysis Review detailed information using groups and filters to analyze trends that lead to crashes. To view more information about crashes, create NRQL queries to review Insights charts related to crash data. Android SDK API Use the Android SDK API for mobile monitoring to instrument parts of your code that are not instrumented by default. Then, view those custom events and attributes in New Relic Insights. Handled exceptions Report exceptions so you can identify factors creating a poor mobile app experience. To further improve performance, review MobileHandledException event records in New Relic Insights. Breadcrumbs Boost the level of detail in crash event trails by adding breadcrumbs. Then, query MobileBreadcrumbs events to see all breadcrumbs or just breadcrumbs related to crashes. See your errors in CodeStream You can also see your Android application's directly in your IDE using CodeStream and errors inbox. To do this, install CodeStream, connect CodeStream and New Relic and create Git tags that match your appVersion.",

      "body": "Important Starting with version 5.9.0 of the New Relic Android agent, you can set a custom user identifier value to associate user sessions with analytics events and attributes. For more information, see the NewRelic.setUserId method. The Android agent provides an SDK API to set up custom instrumentation for monitoring your application. The API gives you the ability to: Instrument your own code. Create, name, and end interaction traces from events in your mobile app. Record custom metrics. Send custom attributes and events to New Relic Insights. Track networking from libraries not supported automatically. Install the SDK Before using the Android SDK API: Review the Android SDK API release notes to ensure you have your app instrumented with a current SDK for mobile monitoring. Go to one.newrelic.com, click Add more data and then follow the steps for Android. For more information, see the detailed Android installation and configuration procedures. If you need to support Android 2.2, see the legacy Android agent SDK procedures. Instrument your code Caution Tracing is heavily optimized, but it does impose a performance overhead. Avoid instrumenting methods that are expected to be called hundreds of times. If you have custom libraries or application code that you want to include in interaction traces: Use the following Java annotation: import com.newrelic.agent.android.instrumentation.Trace; Copy Add the @Trace annotation to the methods you want to instrument: @Trace public void myHeavyweightMethod() { … Copy To indicate what kind of method is being traced, use the optional category attribute. Automatically instrumented methods Automatic instrumentation is one of the agent's more convenient features. However, if it interferes with the method being traced, add @SkipTrace to the method, and the agent will skip it during compile time instrumentation.

Name or rename an interaction See setInteractionName. End an interaction See endInteraction. Disable or enable all interactions See withInteractionTracing. Set an app version associated with an interaction See withApplicationVersion. Set custom build ID See withApplicationBuild. Create custom metrics See recordMetric. Report custom attributes and events There are several ways to add custom attributes and events. For more about which would be the best method to use and why, see Add custom data. Create an attribute: setAttribute Increment an attribute count: incrementAttribute Remove an attribute: removeAttribute Remove all attributes: removeAllAttributes Record custom event: recordCustomEvent Record a breadcrumb event: recordBreadcrumb Set the maximum size of an event pool: setMaxEventPoolSize Set maximum time agent stores events in memory: setMaxEventBufferTime Return the current session's ID: currentSessionId Set custom user ID for associating sessions with events and attributes: setUserId Track custom network requests and failures Use these methods: Record HTTP transactions at varying levels of detail: See noticeHttpTransaction. Record network failures: See noticeNetworkFailure. Record a handled exception as an event, including context See recordHandledException(). Manual cross application tracing The noticeHttpTransaction code does not automatically append the appropriate header ID value needed to get cross application tracing to work. This is why you will not see the application link in your Android app on New Relic's Map page for mobile apps or on the HTTP requests page. You can use a public method in the New Relic Android SDK to get the appropriate ID to pass along with your HTTP request to your back-end application, as long as it is already instrumented by New Relic. The appropriate header ID will be passed from the back-end application in the response, providing everything needed for cross application tracing to function. Cross application tracing example This example adds the NewRelic-ID to the back-end HTTP request, with conn as the external HTTP connection. (Notice the additional import.) import com.newrelic.agent.android.NewRelic; import com.newrelic.agent.android.Agent; //required for getCrossProcessId() ... ... //new method for appending the crossProcessID necessary for CAT in New Relic public static void setCrossProcessHeader(HttpURLConnection conn) { String crossProcessId = Agent.getCrossProcessId(); // API call into the agent for the X-NewRelic-ID if (crossProcessId != null) { conn.setRequestProperty(\"X-NewRelic-ID\", crossProcessId); } } Copy After adding the appropriate header to the request to the back-end app, the response from the app needs to be parsed for the X-Newrelic-App-Data header, and then added to the noticeHttpTransaction call as a string. For example: //NewRelic.noticeHttpTransaction(url, httpMethod, statusCode, startTimeMs, endTimeMs, bytesSent, bytesReceived, responseBody, params, response); //Where xNewRelicAppDataHeader is the value of the X-NewRelic-App-Data header NewRelic.noticeHttpTransaction(\"http://api.newrelic.com\", \"GET\", 200, System.nanoTime(), System.nanoTime(),100 ,100, \"Test\", new HashMap<String, String>(), xNewRelicAppDataHeader); Copy",

Record network failures: See noticeNetworkFailure. Record a handled exception as an event, including context See recordHandledException(). Manual cross application tracing The noticeHttpTransaction code does not automatically append the appropriate header ID value needed to get cross application tracing to work. This is why you will not see the application link in your Android app on New Relic's Map page for mobile apps or on the HTTP requests page. You can use a public method in the New Relic Android SDK to get the appropriate ID to pass along with your HTTP request to your back-end application, as long as it is already instrumented by New Relic. The appropriate header ID will be passed from the back-end application in the response, providing everything needed for cross application tracing to function. Cross application tracing example This example adds the NewRelic-ID to the back-end HTTP request, with conn as the external HTTP connection. (Notice the additional import.) import com.newrelic.agent.android.NewRelic; import com.newrelic.agent.android.Agent; //required for getCrossProcessId() ... ... //new method for appending the crossProcessID necessary for CAT in New Relic public static void setCrossProcessHeader(HttpURLConnection conn) { String crossProcessId = Agent.getCrossProcessId(); // API call into the agent for the X-NewRelic-ID if (crossProcessId != null) { conn.setRequestProperty(\"X-NewRelic-ID\", crossProcessId); } } Copy After adding the appropriate header to the request to the back-end app, the response from the app needs to be parsed for the X-Newrelic-App-Data header, and then added to the noticeHttpTransaction call as a string. For example: //NewRelic.noticeHttpTransaction(url, httpMethod, statusCode, startTimeMs, endTimeMs, bytesSent, bytesReceived, responseBody, params, response); //Where xNewRelicAppDataHeader is the value of the X-NewRelic-App-Data header NewRelic.noticeHttpTransaction(\"http://api.newrelic.com\", \"GET\", 200, System.nanoTime(), System.nanoTime(),100 ,100, \"Test\", new HashMap<String, String>(), xNewRelicAppDataHeader); Copy",

For more information, see the NewRelic.setUserId method. The Android agent provides an SDK API to set up custom instrumentation for monitoring your application. The API gives you the ability to: Instrument your own code. Create, name, and end interaction traces from events in your mobile app. Record custom metrics. Send custom attributes and events to New Relic Insights. Track networking from libraries not supported automatically. Install the SDK Before using the Android SDK API: Review the Android SDK API release notes to ensure you have your app instrumented with a current SDK for mobile monitoring. Go to one.newrelic.com, click Add more data and then follow the steps for Android. For more information, see the detailed Android installation and configuration procedures. If you need to support Android 2.2, see the legacy Android agent SDK procedures. Instrument your code Caution Tracing is heavily optimized, but it does impose a performance overhead. Avoid instrumenting methods that are expected to be called hundreds of times. If you have custom libraries or application code that you want to include in interaction traces: Use the following Java annotation: import com.newrelic.agent.android.instrumentation.Trace; Copy Add the @Trace annotation to the methods you want to instrument: @Trace public void myHeavyweightMethod() { … Copy To indicate what kind of method is being traced, use the optional category attribute.

      "body": "Important Starting with version 5.9.0 of the New Relic Android agent, you can set a custom user identifier value to associate user sessions with analytics events and attributes. For more information, see the NewRelic.setUserId method. The Android agent provides an SDK API to set up custom instrumentation for monitoring your application. The API gives you the ability to: Instrument your own code. Create, name, and end interaction traces from events in your mobile app. Record custom metrics. Send custom attributes and events to New Relic Insights. Track networking from libraries not supported automatically. Install the SDK Before using the Android SDK API: Review the Android SDK API release notes to ensure you have your app instrumented with a current SDK for mobile monitoring. Go to one.newrelic.com, click Add more data and then follow the steps for Android. For more information, see the detailed Android installation and configuration procedures. If you need to support Android 2.2, see the legacy Android agent SDK procedures. Instrument your code Caution Tracing is heavily optimized, but it does impose a performance overhead. Avoid instrumenting methods that are expected to be called hundreds of times. If you have custom libraries or application code that you want to include in interaction traces: Use the following Java annotation: import com.newrelic.agent.android.instrumentation.Trace; Copy Add the @Trace annotation to the methods you want to instrument: @Trace public void myHeavyweightMethod() { … Copy To indicate what kind of method is being traced, use the optional category attribute. Automatically instrumented methods Automatic instrumentation is one of the agent's more convenient features. However, if it interferes with the method being traced, add @SkipTrace to the method, and the agent will skip it during compile time instrumentation.

Record network failures: See noticeNetworkFailure. Record a handled exception as an event, including context See recordHandledException(). Manual cross application tracing The noticeHttpTransaction code does not automatically append the appropriate header ID value needed to get cross application tracing to work. This is why you will not see the application link in your Android app on New Relic's Map page for mobile apps or on the HTTP requests page. You can use a public method in the New Relic Android SDK to get the appropriate ID to pass along with your HTTP request to your back-end application, as long as it is already instrumented by New Relic. The appropriate header ID will be passed from the back-end application in the response, providing everything needed for cross application tracing to function. Cross application tracing example This example adds the NewRelic-ID to the back-end HTTP request, with conn as the external HTTP connection. (Notice the additional import.) import com.newrelic.agent.android.NewRelic; import com.newrelic.agent.android.Agent; //required for getCrossProcessId() ... ... //new method for appending the crossProcessID necessary for CAT in New Relic public static void setCrossProcessHeader(HttpURLConnection conn) { String crossProcessId = Agent.getCrossProcessId(); // API call into the agent for the X-NewRelic-ID if (crossProcessId != null) { conn.setRequestProperty(\"X-NewRelic-ID\", crossProcessId); } } Copy After adding the appropriate header to the request to the back-end app, the response from the app needs to be parsed for the X-Newrelic-App-Data header, and then added to the noticeHttpTransaction call as a string. For example: //NewRelic.noticeHttpTransaction(url, httpMethod, statusCode, startTimeMs, endTimeMs, bytesSent, bytesReceived, responseBody, params, response); //Where xNewRelicAppDataHeader is the value of the X-NewRelic-App-Data header NewRelic.noticeHttpTransaction(\"http://api.newrelic.com\", \"GET\", 200, System.nanoTime(), System.nanoTime(),100 ,100, \"Test\", new HashMap<String, String>(), xNewRelicAppDataHeader); Copy",

Install the Android agent Before you install the Android agent, make sure your app follows the compatibility requirements. As part of the installation process, mobile monitoring automatically generates an application token. This is a 40-character hexadecimal string for authenticating each mobile app that you monitor. Follow the Android installation and configuration procedures for your environment as applicable. If you have problems with your Android installation, or if you do not see data in the mobile monitoring UI for your Android app, follow the troubleshooting procedures. Extend your instrumentation After you install the agent, extend the agent's instrumentation by using the mobile monitoring UI and following up on information in New Relic Insights. To access: In mobile monitoring: In NRQL and dashboards: Custom data Create and record custom events, interaction traces, and attributes to add details to your existing data and traces. Then, view the custom events that you created in NRQL or dashboards. Network requests Enable the MobileRequest event feature so you can perform a full network analysis. To further investigate network request error rates and response times, query MobileRequest and MobileRequestError events. Crash analysis Review detailed information using groups and filters to analyze trends that lead to crashes. To view more information about crashes, create NRQL queries to review Insights charts related to crash data. Android SDK API Use the Android SDK API for mobile monitoring to instrument parts of your code that are not instrumented by default. Then, view those custom events and attributes in New Relic Insights. Handled exceptions Report exceptions so you can identify factors creating a poor mobile app experience. To further improve performance, review MobileHandledException event records in New Relic Insights. Breadcrumbs Boost the level of detail in crash event trails by adding breadcrumbs. Then, query MobileBreadcrumbs events to see all breadcrumbs or just breadcrumbs related to crashes.

Install the Android agent Before you install the Android agent, make sure your app follows the compatibility requirements. As part of the installation process, mobile monitoring automatically generates an application token. This is a 40-character hexadecimal string for authenticating each mobile app that you monitor. Follow the Android installation and configuration procedures for your environment as applicable. If you have problems with your Android installation, or if you do not see data in the mobile monitoring UI for your Android app, follow the troubleshooting procedures. Extend your instrumentation After you install the agent, extend the agent's instrumentation by using the mobile monitoring UI and following up on information in New Relic Insights. To access: In mobile monitoring: In NRQL and dashboards: Custom data Create and record custom events, interaction traces, and attributes to add details to your existing data and traces. Then, view the custom events that you created in NRQL or dashboards. Network requests Enable the MobileRequest event feature so you can perform a full network analysis. To further investigate network request error rates and response times, query MobileRequest and MobileRequestError events. Crash analysis Review detailed information using groups and filters to analyze trends that lead to crashes. To view more information about crashes, create NRQL queries to review Insights charts related to crash data. Android SDK API Use the Android SDK API for mobile monitoring to instrument parts of your code that are not instrumented by default. Then, view those custom events and attributes in New Relic Insights. Handled exceptions Report exceptions so you can identify factors creating a poor mobile app experience. To further improve performance, review MobileHandledException event records in New Relic Insights. Breadcrumbs Boost the level of detail in crash event trails by adding breadcrumbs. Then, query MobileBreadcrumbs events to see all breadcrumbs or just breadcrumbs related to crashes. See your errors in CodeStream You can also see your Android application's directly in your IDE using CodeStream and errors inbox. To do this, install CodeStream, connect CodeStream and New Relic and create Git tags that match your appVersion.",

      "body": "Important Starting with version 5.9.0 of the New Relic Android agent, you can set a custom user identifier value to associate user sessions with analytics events and attributes. For more information, see the NewRelic.setUserId method. The Android agent provides an SDK API to set up custom instrumentation for monitoring your application. The API gives you the ability to: Instrument your own code. Create, name, and end interaction traces from events in your mobile app. Record custom metrics. Send custom attributes and events to New Relic Insights. Track networking from libraries not supported automatically. Install the SDK Before using the Android SDK API: Review the Android SDK API release notes to ensure you have your app instrumented with a current SDK for mobile monitoring. Go to one.newrelic.com, click Add more data and then follow the steps for Android. For more information, see the detailed Android installation and configuration procedures. If you need to support Android 2.2, see the legacy Android agent SDK procedures. Instrument your code Caution Tracing is heavily optimized, but it does impose a performance overhead. Avoid instrumenting methods that are expected to be called hundreds of times. If you have custom libraries or application code that you want to include in interaction traces: Use the following Java annotation: import com.newrelic.agent.android.instrumentation.Trace; Copy Add the @Trace annotation to the methods you want to instrument: @Trace public void myHeavyweightMethod() { … Copy To indicate what kind of method is being traced, use the optional category attribute. Automatically instrumented methods Automatic instrumentation is one of the agent's more convenient features. However, if it interferes with the method being traced, add @SkipTrace to the method, and the agent will skip it during compile time instrumentation.

Record network failures: See noticeNetworkFailure. Record a handled exception as an event, including context See recordHandledException(). Manual cross application tracing The noticeHttpTransaction code does not automatically append the appropriate header ID value needed to get cross application tracing to work. This is why you will not see the application link in your Android app on New Relic's Map page for mobile apps or on the HTTP requests page. You can use a public method in the New Relic Android SDK to get the appropriate ID to pass along with your HTTP request to your back-end application, as long as it is already instrumented by New Relic. The appropriate header ID will be passed from the back-end application in the response, providing everything needed for cross application tracing to function. Cross application tracing example This example adds the NewRelic-ID to the back-end HTTP request, with conn as the external HTTP connection. (Notice the additional import.) import com.newrelic.agent.android.NewRelic; import com.newrelic.agent.android.Agent; //required for getCrossProcessId() ... ... //new method for appending the crossProcessID necessary for CAT in New Relic public static void setCrossProcessHeader(HttpURLConnection conn) { String crossProcessId = Agent.getCrossProcessId(); // API call into the agent for the X-NewRelic-ID if (crossProcessId != null) { conn.setRequestProperty(\"X-NewRelic-ID\", crossProcessId); } } Copy After adding the appropriate header to the request to the back-end app, the response from the app needs to be parsed for the X-Newrelic-App-Data header, and then added to the noticeHttpTransaction call as a string. For example: //NewRelic.noticeHttpTransaction(url, httpMethod, statusCode, startTimeMs, endTimeMs, bytesSent, bytesReceived, responseBody, params, response); //Where xNewRelicAppDataHeader is the value of the X-NewRelic-App-Data header NewRelic.noticeHttpTransaction(\"http://api.newrelic.com\", \"GET\", 200, System.nanoTime(), System.nanoTime(),100 ,100, \"Test\", new HashMap<String, String>(), xNewRelicAppDataHeader); Copy",

For example: //NewRelic.noticeHttpTransaction(url, httpMethod, statusCode, startTimeMs, endTimeMs, bytesSent, bytesReceived, responseBody, params, response); //Where xNewRelicAppDataHeader is the value of the X-NewRelic-App-Data header NewRelic.noticeHttpTransaction(\"http://api.newrelic.com\", \"GET\", 200, System.nanoTime(), System.nanoTime(),100 ,100, \"Test\", new HashMap<String, String>(), xNewRelicAppDataHeader); Copy",

Install the Android agent Before you install the Android agent, make sure your app follows the compatibility requirements. As part of the installation process, mobile monitoring automatically generates an application token. This is a 40-character hexadecimal string for authenticating each mobile app that you monitor. Follow the Android installation and configuration procedures for your environment as applicable. If you have problems with your Android installation, or if you do not see data in the mobile monitoring UI for your Android app, follow the troubleshooting procedures. Extend your instrumentation After you install the agent, extend the agent's instrumentation by using the mobile monitoring UI and following up on information in New Relic Insights. To access: In mobile monitoring: In NRQL and dashboards: Custom data Create and record custom events, interaction traces, and attributes to add details to your existing data and traces. Then, view the custom events that you created in NRQL or dashboards. Network requests Enable the MobileRequest event feature so you can perform a full network analysis. To further investigate network request error rates and response times, query MobileRequest and MobileRequestError events. Crash analysis Review detailed information using groups and filters to analyze trends that lead to crashes. To view more information about crashes, create NRQL queries to review Insights charts related to crash data. Android SDK API Use the Android SDK API for mobile monitoring to instrument parts of your code that are not instrumented by default. Then, view those custom events and attributes in New Relic Insights. Handled exceptions Report exceptions so you can identify factors creating a poor mobile app experience. To further improve performance, review MobileHandledException event records in New Relic Insights. Breadcrumbs Boost the level of detail in crash event trails by adding breadcrumbs. Then, query MobileBreadcrumbs events to see all breadcrumbs or just breadcrumbs related to crashes.

      "body": "Important Starting with version 5.9.0 of the New Relic Android agent, you can set a custom user identifier value to associate user sessions with analytics events and attributes. For more information, see the NewRelic.setUserId method. The Android agent provides an SDK API to set up custom instrumentation for monitoring your application. The API gives you the ability to: Instrument your own code. Create, name, and end interaction traces from events in your mobile app. Record custom metrics. Send custom attributes and events to New Relic Insights. Track networking from libraries not supported automatically. Install the SDK Before using the Android SDK API: Review the Android SDK API release notes to ensure you have your app instrumented with a current SDK for mobile monitoring. Go to one.newrelic.com, click Add more data and then follow the steps for Android. For more information, see the detailed Android installation and configuration procedures. If you need to support Android 2.2, see the legacy Android agent SDK procedures. Instrument your code Caution Tracing is heavily optimized, but it does impose a performance overhead. Avoid instrumenting methods that are expected to be called hundreds of times. If you have custom libraries or application code that you want to include in interaction traces: Use the following Java annotation: import com.newrelic.agent.android.instrumentation.Trace; Copy Add the @Trace annotation to the methods you want to instrument: @Trace public void myHeavyweightMethod() { … Copy To indicate what kind of method is being traced, use the optional category attribute. Automatically instrumented methods Automatic instrumentation is one of the agent's more convenient features. However, if it interferes with the method being traced, add @SkipTrace to the method, and the agent will skip it during compile time instrumentation.

Name or rename an interaction See setInteractionName. End an interaction See endInteraction. Disable or enable all interactions See withInteractionTracing. Set an app version associated with an interaction See withApplicationVersion. Set custom build ID See withApplicationBuild. Create custom metrics See recordMetric. Report custom attributes and events There are several ways to add custom attributes and events. For more about which would be the best method to use and why, see Add custom data. Create an attribute: setAttribute Increment an attribute count: incrementAttribute Remove an attribute: removeAttribute Remove all attributes: removeAllAttributes Record custom event: recordCustomEvent Record a breadcrumb event: recordBreadcrumb Set the maximum size of an event pool: setMaxEventPoolSize Set maximum time agent stores events in memory: setMaxEventBufferTime Return the current session's ID: currentSessionId Set custom user ID for associating sessions with events and attributes: setUserId Track custom network requests and failures Use these methods: Record HTTP transactions at varying levels of detail: See noticeHttpTransaction. Record network failures: See noticeNetworkFailure. Record a handled exception as an event, including context See recordHandledException(). Manual cross application tracing The noticeHttpTransaction code does not automatically append the appropriate header ID value needed to get cross application tracing to work. This is why you will not see the application link in your Android app on New Relic's Map page for mobile apps or on the HTTP requests page. You can use a public method in the New Relic Android SDK to get the appropriate ID to pass along with your HTTP request to your back-end application, as long as it is already instrumented by New Relic. The appropriate header ID will be passed from the back-end application in the response, providing everything needed for cross application tracing to function. Cross application tracing example This example adds the NewRelic-ID to the back-end HTTP request, with conn as the external HTTP connection. (Notice the additional import.) import com.newrelic.agent.android.NewRelic; import com.newrelic.agent.android.Agent; //required for getCrossProcessId() ... ... //new method for appending the crossProcessID necessary for CAT in New Relic public static void setCrossProcessHeader(HttpURLConnection conn) { String crossProcessId = Agent.getCrossProcessId(); // API call into the agent for the X-NewRelic-ID if (crossProcessId != null) { conn.setRequestProperty(\"X-NewRelic-ID\", crossProcessId); } } Copy After adding the appropriate header to the request to the back-end app, the response from the app needs to be parsed for the X-Newrelic-App-Data header, and then added to the noticeHttpTransaction call as a string. For example: //NewRelic.noticeHttpTransaction(url, httpMethod, statusCode, startTimeMs, endTimeMs, bytesSent, bytesReceived, responseBody, params, response); //Where xNewRelicAppDataHeader is the value of the X-NewRelic-App-Data header NewRelic.noticeHttpTransaction(\"http://api.newrelic.com\", \"GET\", 200, System.nanoTime(), System.nanoTime(),100 ,100, \"Test\", new HashMap<String, String>(), xNewRelicAppDataHeader); Copy",

      "body": "Important Starting with version 5.9.0 of the New Relic Android agent, you can set a custom user identifier value to associate user sessions with analytics events and attributes. For more information, see the NewRelic.setUserId method. The Android agent provides an SDK API to set up custom instrumentation for monitoring your application. The API gives you the ability to: Instrument your own code. Create, name, and end interaction traces from events in your mobile app. Record custom metrics. Send custom attributes and events to New Relic Insights. Track networking from libraries not supported automatically. Install the SDK Before using the Android SDK API: Review the Android SDK API release notes to ensure you have your app instrumented with a current SDK for mobile monitoring. Go to one.newrelic.com, click Add more data and then follow the steps for Android. For more information, see the detailed Android installation and configuration procedures. If you need to support Android 2.2, see the legacy Android agent SDK procedures. Instrument your code Caution Tracing is heavily optimized, but it does impose a performance overhead. Avoid instrumenting methods that are expected to be called hundreds of times. If you have custom libraries or application code that you want to include in interaction traces: Use the following Java annotation: import com.newrelic.agent.android.instrumentation.Trace; Copy Add the @Trace annotation to the methods you want to instrument: @Trace public void myHeavyweightMethod() { … Copy To indicate what kind of method is being traced, use the optional category attribute. Automatically instrumented methods Automatic instrumentation is one of the agent's more convenient features. However, if it interferes with the method being traced, add @SkipTrace to the method, and the agent will skip it during compile time instrumentation.

If you want to... Do this Track app activity that may be helpful for troubleshooting crashes See recordBreadcrumb. Track a method as an interaction See startInteraction. Name or rename an interaction See setInteractionName. End an interaction See endInteraction. Disable or enable all interactions See withInteractionTracing. Set an app version associated with an interaction See withApplicationVersion. Set custom build ID See withApplicationBuild. Create custom metrics See recordMetric. Report custom attributes and events There are several ways to add custom attributes and events. For more about which would be the best method to use and why, see Add custom data. Create an attribute: setAttribute Increment an attribute count: incrementAttribute Remove an attribute: removeAttribute Remove all attributes: removeAllAttributes Record custom event: recordCustomEvent Record a breadcrumb event: recordBreadcrumb Set the maximum size of an event pool: setMaxEventPoolSize Set maximum time agent stores events in memory: setMaxEventBufferTime Return the current session's ID: currentSessionId Set custom user ID for associating sessions with events and attributes: setUserId Track custom network requests and failures Use these methods: Record HTTP transactions at varying levels of detail: See noticeHttpTransaction. Record network failures: See noticeNetworkFailure. Record a handled exception as an event, including context See recordHandledException(). Manual cross application tracing The noticeHttpTransaction code does not automatically append the appropriate header ID value needed to get cross application tracing to work. This is why you will not see the application link in your Android app on New Relic's Map page for mobile apps or on the HTTP requests page. You can use a public method in the New Relic Android SDK to get the appropriate ID to pass along with your HTTP request to your back-end application, as long as it is already instrumented by New Relic. The appropriate header ID will be passed from the back-end application in the response, providing everything needed for cross application tracing to function. Cross application tracing example This example adds the NewRelic-ID to the back-end HTTP request, with conn as the external HTTP connection. (Notice the additional import.) import com.newrelic.agent.android.NewRelic; import com.newrelic.agent.android.Agent; //required for getCrossProcessId() ... ... //new method for appending the crossProcessID necessary for CAT in New Relic public static void setCrossProcessHeader(HttpURLConnection conn) { String crossProcessId = Agent.getCrossProcessId(); // API call into the agent for the X-NewRelic-ID if (crossProcessId != null) { conn.setRequestProperty(\"X-NewRelic-ID\", crossProcessId); } } Copy After adding the appropriate header to the request to the back-end app, the response from the app needs to be parsed for the X-Newrelic-App-Data header, and then added to the noticeHttpTransaction call as a string. For example: //NewRelic.noticeHttpTransaction(url, httpMethod, statusCode, startTimeMs, endTimeMs, bytesSent, bytesReceived, responseBody, params, response); //Where xNewRelicAppDataHeader is the value of the X-NewRelic-App-Data header NewRelic.noticeHttpTransaction(\"http://api.newrelic.com\", \"GET\", 200, System.nanoTime(), System.nanoTime(),100 ,100, \"Test\", new HashMap<String, String>(), xNewRelicAppDataHeader); Copy",

If a network request fails, you can record details about the failure with noticeNetworkFailure. In most cases, place this call inside exception handlers, such as catch blocks. For general info on using the New Relic Android SDK API, see the usage guide. Parameters Parameter Description NewRelic.noticeNetworkFailure(string $url, string $httpMethod, long $startTime, long $endTime, exception $exception OR $networkFailure) Copy $url string Required. The URL of the request. $httpMethod string Required. The HTTP method used, such as GET or POST. $startTime long Required. The start time of the request in milliseconds since the epoch. $endTime long Required. The end time of the request in milliseconds since the epoch. $exception string Either this or $failure parameter is required. This is the exception that occurred. New Relic can automatically translate many common exceptions into network failure types. $failure enum Either this or $exception parameter is required. The type of network failure that occurred. If an exception cannot be resolved to a network failure automatically, this method can be used to categorize the failure accurately. The values are defined by the NetworkFailure enum. Valid values include Unknown, BadURL, TimedOut, CannotConnectToHost, DNSLookupFailed, BadServerResponse, and SecureConnectionFailed.

If you have previously installed the Android agent SDK for mobile monitoring, follow the steps before upgrading to the latest version with Gradle and Android Studio. Install your Android app As part of the installation process for mobile monitoring, New Relic automatically generates an application token. This is a 40-character hexadecimal string for authenticating each mobile app you monitor in New Relic. Go to one.newrelic.com > Mobile. If applicable: From the Mobile apps index, select Add a new app. From the Get started page, select Android as the platform for mobile monitoring. Type a meaningful name for your mobile app, and select Continue. Continue with the steps to configure mobile monitoring with Gradle and Android Studio. OR: To complete the configuration process for a new mobile app later: Go to one.newrelic.com > Mobile, then select See instructions next to your mobile app name. To upgrade an existing Android installation: Go to one.newrelic.com > Mobile > (select an app) > Settings > Installation. Configure with Gradle and Android Studio These procedures to configure your Android app with Gradle and Android Studio also appear on the Get started page in New Relic. Merge New Relic's mobile monitoring code in the Gradle & Android Studio tab to your build.gradle file. Project level build.gradle file: In this example, AGENT_VERSION represents your agent version number. See the agent release notes, and use the latest version. buildscript { repositories { mavenCentral() } dependencies { classpath \"com.newrelic.agent.android:agent-gradle-plugin:AGENT_VERSION\" } } Copy App level build.gradle file: In this example, AGENT_VERSION represents your agent version number. See the agent release notes, and use the latest version. repositories { mavenCentral() } apply plugin: 'android' apply plugin: 'newrelic' dependencies { compile 'com.newrelic.agent.android:android-agent:AGENT_VERSION' } Copy ProGuard or DexGuard: In your project’s root directory (projectname/app), add a newrelic.properties file with the following line: com.newrelic.application_token=GENERATED_TOKEN Copy Follow the additional, required configuration steps for using ProGuard or DexGuard with New Relic. Set app permissions: Ensure that your Android app requests INTERNET and ACCESS_NETWORK_STATE permissions by adding these lines to your AndroidManifest.xml file: <uses-permission android:name=\"android.permission.INTERNET\" /> <uses-permission android:name=\"android.permission.ACCESS_NETWORK_STATE\" /> Copy To start New Relic's mobile monitoring agent: In your Default Activity (as defined in your Manifest), import the NewRelic class: import com.newrelic.agent.android.NewRelic; Copy Important We do not support starting the mobile monitoring agent in other classes, as that can cause unexpected or unstable behavior. To initialize mobile monitoring: In the onCreate() method, add this call: NewRelic.withApplicationToken(\"GENERATED_TOKEN\").start(this.getApplication()); Copy Optional: Change the logging level. To build and run your application: Clean your project, then run your app in an emulator or device to generate traffic. Wait a few minutes, then view data for your Android app from the Overview page: Go to one.newrelic.com > Mobile > (select an app). If you have problems with your Android installation, or if you do not see data in the mobile monitoring UI, follow the troubleshooting procedures. Update your Android installation To keep your Android agent up to date, follow the procedures to upgrade the Android agent SDK for New Relic. To install the latest Android version for your mobile app: Go to one.newrelic.com > Mobile > (select an app) > Settings > Installation. Android 4.x: Multidex support New Relic's mobile monitoring for Android versions prior to Android 5.0 (API level 21) use the Dalvik runtime to execute app code. By default, Dalvik limits apps to a single classes.dex bytecode file per APK. In order to get around this limitation, you must enable multidex support. Then you can use the multidex support library, which becomes part of the primary DEX file of your app and then manages access to the additional DEX files and the code they contain. When building each DEX file for a multidex app, the build tools perform complex decision making to determine which classes are needed in the primary DEX file so that your app can start successfully. If any class required during startup is not provided in the primary DEX file, then your app crashes with the error java.lang.NoClassDefFoundError. If you see the java.lang.NoClassDefFoundError error, then you must manually specify these additional classes as required in the primary DEX file: Create a proguard.multidex.config file within the /app folder of your project. Update mypackage to reflect your package name. #################### # keep class names # #################### #Keep New Relic in the main dex -keep class com.newrelic.** { *; } -keep class com.mypackage.activities.** { *; } Copy Merge the following code into the app-level build.gradle file: android { defaultConfig{ … multiDexKeepProguard file(\"proguard.multidex.config\") } } Copy For more information, see the Android Developers documentation on declaring classes required in the primary DEX file.

Android 4.x: Multidex support New Relic's mobile monitoring for Android versions prior to Android 5.0 (API level 21) use the Dalvik runtime to execute app code. By default, Dalvik limits apps to a single classes.dex bytecode file per APK. In order to get around this limitation, you must enable multidex support. Then you can use the multidex support library, which becomes part of the primary DEX file of your app and then manages access to the additional DEX files and the code they contain. When building each DEX file for a multidex app, the build tools perform complex decision making to determine which classes are needed in the primary DEX file so that your app can start successfully. If any class required during startup is not provided in the primary DEX file, then your app crashes with the error java.lang.NoClassDefFoundError. If you see the java.lang.NoClassDefFoundError error, then you must manually specify these additional classes as required in the primary DEX file: Create a proguard.multidex.config file within the /app folder of your project. Update mypackage to reflect your package name. #################### # keep class names # #################### #Keep New Relic in the main dex -keep class com.newrelic.** { *; } -keep class com.mypackage.activities.** { *; } Copy Merge the following code into the app-level build.gradle file: android { defaultConfig{ … multiDexKeepProguard file(\"proguard.multidex.config\") } } Copy For more information, see the Android Developers documentation on declaring classes required in the primary DEX file.

      "body": "Here are some technical details about how New Relic distributed tracing works: How trace sampling works How we structure trace data How we store trace data How trace context is passed between applications Tip For instructions about setting up distributed tracing, see Overview: Enable distributed tracing. Trace sampling How your traces are sampled will depend on your setup and the New Relic tracing tool you're using. For example, you may be using a third-party telemetry service (like OpenTelemetry) to implement sampling of traces before your data gets to us. Or, if you're using Infinite Tracing, you'd probably send us all your trace data and rely on our sampling. We have a few sampling strategies available: Head-based sampling (standard distributed tracing) Tail-based sampling (Infinite Tracing) No sampling Head-based sampling (standard distributed tracing) With the exception of our Infinite Tracing feature, most of our tracing tools use a head-based sampling approach. This applies filters to individual spans before all spans in a trace arrive, which means decisions about whether to accept spans are made at the beginning (the \"head\") of the filtering process. We use this sampling strategy to capture a representative sample of activity while avoiding storage and performance issues. Here are some details about how head-based sampling is implemented in our standard distributed tracing tools: Language agents: adaptive sampling Our APM language agents use adaptive sampling to capture a representative sample of system activity. The following is an explanation of how adaptive sampling works. For the first service in a distributed trace, 10 requests are chosen to be sampled. The throughput to that service is used to adjust how frequently requests are sampled. This is explained in more detail below. The first service we monitor in a distributed trace is called the trace origin. The trace origin chooses requests at random to be traced. That decision propagates to the downstream services touched by that request. When the request has completed, all of the spans touched by that request that we've detected are made available in the UI as a complete trace (though agent limits may result in fragmented traces). APM agents have a limit on the number of transactions collected per minute (this can vary, depending on agent) and a limit on the number of spans collected per minute (1000 per agent instance). To adhere to these limits, the default number of traces at the trace origin is 10 traces per minute. An APM agent spreads out the collection of these 10 traces over a minute in order to get a representative sample over time. The exact sampling rate depends on the number of transactions in the previous minute. The rate responds to changes in transaction throughput, going up or down. For example, if the previous minute had 100 transactions, the agent would anticipate a similar number of transactions and select 1 out of every 10 transactions to be traced. Language agents: limits and sampling An APM language agent instance using head-based sampling has a limit of 1000 spans per minute. The agent attempts to keep all spans that are marked to be sampled as part of a distributed trace. In many distributed systems, the average microservice may generate 10 to 20 spans per request. In those cases, the agent span limit can accommodate all spans chosen, and that service will have full detail in a trace. However, some requests to services will generate many spans, and the agent span limit will be reached. As a result, some traces will not have full detail for that service. One solution to this would be to custom instrument an agent to report less activity and therefore report fewer spans. To read about how browser monitoring of trace data may vary from our language agents, see Browser traces. Trace rate limiting If the above sampling methods still result in too much trace data, we may limit incoming data by sampling traces after they're received. By making this decision at the trace level, it avoids fragmenting traces (accepting only part of a trace). This process works similarly to adaptive sampling. The total spans received in a minute are totaled. If too many spans are received, fewer spans may be accepted in the following minute, in order to achieve a floating-average throughput rate. For other details about limits, see New Relic data usage limits and policies. Lambda trace sampling Our AWS Lambda monitoring uses its own sampling process. Tail-based sampling (Infinite Tracing) Our Infinite Tracing feature uses a tail-based sampling approach. \"Tail-based sampling\" means that trace-retention decisions are done at the tail end of processing after all the spans in a trace have arrived. With Infinite Tracing, you can send us 100% of your trace data from your application or third-party telemetry service, and Infinite Tracing will figure out which trace data is most important. And you can configure the sampling to ensure the traces important to you are retained. Architecture For Infinite Tracing, agents or integrations send 100% of all instrumented spans to a trace observer. The trace observer is a distributed tracing service residing in a cluster of services on AWS called New Relic Edge. Tip Only your spans go to the trace observer—all other data such as metrics, custom events, and transaction traces are sent the normal route to New Relic and are subject to local sampling. You configure a unique trace observer endpoint for the AWS region you want to send data to. You can request multiple endpoints, one per AWS region. The endpoint represents a trace observer for a particular workload. For example, all spans from a single trace (request) must go to that endpoint. Here are two architectural diagrams: one showing how data flows if you use APM agents and another if you use New Relic integrations like OpenTelemetry exporters: The trace observer holds traces open while spans for that trace arrive. Once the first span in a trace arrives, a session is kept open for 10 seconds. Each time a new span for that trace arrives, the expiration time is reset to 10 seconds. Traces that haven't seen a span arrive within the last 10 seconds will automatically expire. Tail-based sampling algorithms By default, each trace observer offers traces to three samplers: one looking for duration outliers, one looking for traces with errors, and one trying to randomly sample across all trace types. Each sampler keeps a target percentage of traces that match their criteria. Here are details about each sampler: Sampler Matching criteria Target percent Duration Traces with an outlier duration, using two algorithms: Gaussian (Assumes a normal distribution and a threshold at the 99th percentile) Eccentricity (Assumes no distribution and a threshold based on cluster) 100% Error Traces having at least one span with an error 100% Random All traces 1% (This is configurable. See Infinite Tracing: Random trace filter) If the matching criteria matches the trace, each sampler looks at the trace’s shape. A trace’s shape is the unique combination of the root span’s entity name and span name. This is a simple way to separate traces using the entry point of the request. Once the shape is determined, the sampler makes a decision to keep or reject the trace based on its target sampling percent. If it’s 100%, the trace is automatically kept. If it’s anything less, the probability the sampler keeps a given trace is determined by the target percent. For example, the default target percent is 1 for random traces, so 1% of those traces are kept. If you prefer, you can change the random filter percentage. Because the trace observer uses percentages of throughput, the number of traces selected will vary with that throughput. No sampling Some of our tools don't use sampling. Sampling details for these tools: Browser and mobile trace reporting Browser monitoring distributed tracing and mobile monitoring report all spans. Our APM language agents are often used in conjunction with browser and mobile monitoring, and our language agents use sampling. This means that there will likely be many more browser and mobile spans than back-end spans, which can result in browser and mobile app spans disconnected from back-end spans. For tips on querying for traces that contain front and back-end spans, see Find browser span data. Trace API If you don't have Infinite Tracing enabled, our Trace API does no sampling (unless the default data limits are exceeded). It's expected that you set up the Trace API to send us the traces you think are important. How trace data is structured Understanding the structure of a distributed trace can help you: Understand how traces are displayed in our UI Help you query trace data A distributed trace has a tree-like structure, with \"child\" spans that refer to one \"parent\" span. This diagram shows some important span relationships in a trace: This diagram shows how spans in a distributed trace relate to each other. This diagram shows several important concepts: Trace root. The first service or process in a trace is referred to as the root service or process. Process boundaries. A process represents the execution of a logical piece of code. Examples of a process include a backend service or Lambda function. Spans within a process are categorized as one of the following: Entry span: the first span in a process. Exit span: a span is a considered an exit span if it a) is the parent of an entry span, or b) has http. or db. attributes and therefore represents an external call. In-process span: a span that represents an internal method call or function and that is not an exit or entry span. Client spans. A client span represents a call to another entity or external dependency. Currently, there are two client span types: Datastore. If a client span has any attributes prefixed with db. (like db.statement), it's categorized as a datastore span. External. If a client span has any attributes prefixed with http. (like http.url) or has a child span in another process, it's categorized as an external span. This is a general category for any external calls that are not datastore queries. Trace duration. A trace's total duration is determined by the length of time from the start of the earliest span to the completion of the last span. You can query span relationship data with the NerdGraph GraphiQL explorer at api.newrelic.com/graphiql. How trace data is stored Understanding how we store trace data can help you query your trace data. We save trace data as: Span: A span represents operations that are part of a distributed trace. The operations that a span can represent include browser-side interactions, datastore queries, calls to other services, method-level timing, and Lambda functions. One example: in an HTTP service, a span is created at the start of an HTTP request and completed when the HTTP server returns a response. Span attributes contain important information about that operation (such as duration, host data, etc.), including trace-relationship details (such as traceId, guid). For span-related data, see span attributes. Transaction: If an entity in a trace is monitored by an agent, a request to that entity generates a single Transaction event. Transactions allow trace data to be tied to other New Relic features. For transaction-related data, see transaction attributes. Contextual metadata. We store metadata that shows calculations about a trace and the relationships between its spans. To query this data, use the NerdGraph GraphiQL explorer. How trace context is passed between applications We support the W3C Trace Context standard, which makes it easier to trace transactions across networks and services. When you enable distributed tracing, New Relic agents add HTTP headers to a service's outbound requests. HTTP headers act like passports on an international trip: They identify your software traces and carry important information as they travel through various networks, processes, and security systems. The headers also contain information that helps us link the spans together later: metadata like the trace ID, span ID, the New Relic account ID, and sampling information. See the table below for more details on the header: Item Description accountId This is your New Relic account ID. However, only those on your account and New Relic Admins can associate this Id with your account information in any way. appId This is the application ID of the application generating the trace header. Much like accountId, this identifier is not going to provide any information unless you're a user on the account. guid With Distributed Tracing, each segment of work in a trace is represented by a span, and each span has a guid attribute. The guid of the last span within the process is sent with the outgoing request so that the first segment of work in the receiving service can add this guid as the parentId attribute which connects data within the trace. Parent type The source of the trace header, as in mobile, browser, Ruby app, etc. This becomes the parent.type attribute on the transaction triggered by the request this header is attached to. Priority A randomly generated priority ranking value that helps determine which data is sampled when sampling limits are reached. This is a float value set by the first New Relic agent that’s part of the request so all data in the trace will have the same priority value. Sampled A boolean value that tells the agent if traced data should be collected for the request. This is also added as an attribute on any span and transaction data collected. If you want to read more about this sampling process, this guide goes into more detail. Timestamp Unix timestamp in milliseconds when the payload was created. traceId The unique ID (a randomly generated string) used to identify a single request as it crosses inter- and intra- process boundaries. This ID allows the linking of spans in a distributed trace. This also is added as an attribute on the span and transaction data. transactionId The unique identifier for the transaction event. Trusted acount key This is a key that helps identify any other accounts associated with your account. So if you have multiple sub-accounts that the trace crosses, we can confirm that any data included in the trace is coming from a trusted source, and tells us what users should have access to the data. Version and data key This identifies major/minor versions, so if an agent receives a trace header from a version with breaking changes from the one it is on, it can reject that header and report the rejection and reason. This header information is passed along each span of a trace, unless the progress is stopped by something like middleware or agents that don't recognize the header format (see Figure 1). Figure 1 To address the problem of header propagation, we support the W3C Trace Context specification that requires two standardized headers. Our latest W3C New Relic agents send and receive these two required headers, and by default, they also send and receive the header of the prior New Relic agent: W3C (traceparent): The primary header that identifies the entire trace (trace ID) and the calling service (span id). W3C (tracestate): A required header that carries vendor-specific information and tracks where a trace has been. New Relic (newrelic): The original, proprietary header that is still sent to maintain backward compatibility with prior New Relic agents. This combination of three headers allows traces to be propagated across services instrumented with these types of agents: W3C New Relic agents Non-W3C New Relic agents W3C Trace Context-compatible agents Important If your requests only touch W3C Trace Context-compatible agents, you can opt to turn off the New Relic header. See the agent configuration documentation for details about turning off the newrelic header. The scenarios below show various types of successful header propagation. Scenario 1: Trace touching three agent types This shows the flow of headers when a request touches three different agent types: Scenario 2: Trace with W3C New Relic and middleware This shows the combination of headers sent by a W3C New Relic agent to some middleware. Scenario 3: Trace with any W3C-compliant agent and a New Relic agent. This shows the two required W3C headers from another vendor accepted by a W3C New Relic agent.",

      "body": "If you're following the Enable distributed tracing procedures and want to set up Infinite Tracing, you'll need to set up a trace observer. A trace observer is a cloud-based New Relic tool that decides what trace data to keep and send to New Relic. The trace observer lives in New Relic Edge, which is an AWS-based service that provides you with a low-latency and low-cost way to send your telemetry data to New Relic. The trace observer sends data via our Trace API, which is the entry point for all distributed trace data we ingest. Tip This documentation is for our Infinite Tracing feature. To learn about all our distributed tracing options, see Intro to distributed tracing. Set up the trace observer Before setting up a trace observer, understand these points: With the exception of the Trace API, these instructions are not standalone; they're part of larger enable procedures. If you're still figuring out what you need, see Enable distributed tracing. To avoid configuration conflict issues, you should ideally enable Infinite Tracing for all associated services. If some services in a trace have our standard distributed tracing enabled, you should upgrade those to Infinite Tracing. To set up a trace observer: Go to one.newrelic.com, and click Apps. Under Your apps, click New Relic Edge. Select an account in the upper-left dropdown. If you have access to multiple accounts, make sure you're in the account where you want Infinite Tracing enabled. If no trace observers are already present, click New trace observer to add one, fill out the information, and click Create. Important Note: If you select a trace observer in an EU region, you’ll still need a US-based New Relic account because data is reported to US data centers. Under the Endpoints dropdown: Copy the For other integrations endpoint value and have it ready: this will be referred to in later instructions as YOUR_TRACE_OBSERVER_URL. If you're enabling a language agent, also copy the For language agents value and have it ready: this will be referred to as YOUR_TRACE_OBSERVER_HOST. (Optional but recommended) To verify things are working, we recommend sending a sample trace payload. If you're using our Trace API: this step is especially recommended to learn how the API works. Send sample payload Important If you're using Zipkin-format data, see Send Zipkin payload. This test sends a sample trace payload with one trace and two spans from a service named Test Service A. To send this sample request: Get the license key for the account you want to report data to and have it ready. Copy the following curl request into a text editor: curl -i -H \"Content-Type: application/json\" \\ -H \"Api-Key: $YOUR_LICENSE_KEY\" \\ -H 'Data-Format: newrelic' \\ -H 'Data-Format-Version: 1' \\ -X POST \\ -d '[ { \"common\": { \"attributes\": { \"environment\": \"staging\" } }, \"spans\": [ { \"trace.id\": \"123456\", \"id\": \"ABC\", \"attributes\": { \"duration.ms\": 12.53, \"host\": \"host123.example.com\", \"name\": \"/home\", \"service.name\": \"Test Service A\" } }, { \"trace.id\": \"123456\", \"id\": \"DEF\", \"attributes\": { \"duration.ms\": 2.97, \"host\": \"host456.example.com\", \"error.message\": \"Invalid credentials\", \"name\": \"/auth\", \"parent.id\": \"ABC\", \"service.name\": \"Test Service B\" } } ] } ]' \\ '$YOUR_TRACE_OBSERVER_URL' Copy Insert your own values into the curl request: Value Description $YOUR_LICENSE_KEY Replace this with your license key. $YOUR_TRACE_OBSERVER_URL Replace this with the For other integrations endpoint value you copied in a previous step. Copy the curl request into a terminal and execute it. The test should return HTTP/1.1 202 Accepted, indicating success. If it does not, check the following common issues: Confirm that you used the For other integrations endpoint value. Confirm you're using single quotes around YOUR_TRACE_OBSERVER_URL. Check that you're using the correct API key. If your test returned HTTP/1.1 202 Accepted, go to the New Relic UI to see a query of the sample payload data using the span attribute service.name = Test Service A (here's a link for that query). Because the sample payload contains an error attribute, the error sampler will mark it for keeping. If you modify the payload to remove the error attributes, the random sampler may not choose to keep this particular trace. Tip Traces may take up to one minute to show up in the UI. (Optional) There are several ways to configure Infinite Tracing. This configuration can wait until after you've completed the enable procedures. This procedure is complete. Next, return to finish any remaining instructions for the tracing tool you started enabling: Language agents Third-party telemetry integrations (OpenTelemetry and others) Trace API: once the trace observer is set up, you're finished and can start instrumenting your application. Trace observer endpoints In the trace observer UI, there's an Endpoints dropdown. When setting up the trace observer, we have you copy these values for use at various points of our tracing tool setup instructions. There are two values: For language agents: This value is referenced in our code examples as YOUR_TRACE_OBSERVER_HOST. This is used for configuring our language agents to send data to the trace observer. For other integrations: This value is referenced in our code examples as YOUR_TRACE_OBSERVER_URL. This is used for configuring our telemetry integrations and for sending data via the Trace API (including sending sample payloads).",

Android 4.x: Multidex support New Relic's mobile monitoring for Android versions prior to Android 5.0 (API level 21) use the Dalvik runtime to execute app code. By default, Dalvik limits apps to a single classes.dex bytecode file per APK. In order to get around this limitation, you must enable multidex support. Then you can use the multidex support library, which becomes part of the primary DEX file of your app and then manages access to the additional DEX files and the code they contain. When building each DEX file for a multidex app, the build tools perform complex decision making to determine which classes are needed in the primary DEX file so that your app can start successfully. If any class required during startup is not provided in the primary DEX file, then your app crashes with the error java.lang.NoClassDefFoundError. If you see the java.lang.NoClassDefFoundError error, then you must manually specify these additional classes as required in the primary DEX file: Create a proguard.multidex.config file within the /app folder of your project. Update mypackage to reflect your package name. #################### # keep class names # #################### #Keep New Relic in the main dex -keep class com.newrelic.** { *; } -keep class com.mypackage.activities.** { *; } Copy Merge the following code into the app-level build.gradle file: android { defaultConfig{ … multiDexKeepProguard file(\"proguard.multidex.config\") } } Copy For more information, see the Android Developers documentation on declaring classes required in the primary DEX file.

      "body": "Android Instant Apps allow users to quickly use your applications without installation. With the Android agent version 5.17.0 and higher, you can use New Relic to detect and instrument all feature modules for an instant app. Use this documentation along with the standard New Relic procedures to install Android apps with Gradle and Android Studio. After following the standard installation procedures, follow these additional steps for Android instant apps. Terminology This procedure uses the following terms that are specific to the Android Instant Apps plugin: Module: Any packaged class and/or resource collection APK: A module that packages the apps resources and DEX’ed classes Feature module: A slimmed down module that contains only a subset of the total APK Install the plugin To install the New Relic plugin for Android Instant Apps: First follow the steps in the Install Android apps with Gradle and Android Studio documentation. Apply the agent plugin in every project Gradle build file. List the Android agent as a dependency. Start the agent from each Activity class in the feature that could be side-loaded through a Digital Asset Link intent, (for example, mobile.example.com/signin). Minimal build.gradle example apply plugin: ‘com.android.[application|library|feature|instantapp]' apply plugin: ‘newrelic’ dependencies { implementation \"com.newrelic.agent.android:android-agent:${project.agentVersion}\" } Copy Review the considerations for instrumentation. Instrumentation When instrumenting an instant app, be aware of the following considerations with APKs: Instant apps and APKs Comments Instrumentation Instrumentation of instant apps behaves the same as instrumentation with a normal APK. The agent will detect when an APK is an instant app. For feature APKs, the agent will inject a unique build ID that instant apps will use when reporting crashes. The side-loaded (main) activity of every feature must call NewRelic.start() when the activity is created (as per normal instructions). ProGuard and Dexguard support for feature and application APKs Place the newrelic.properties file in the root (main) directory of the project. ProGuard and Dexguard support The Android Studio Gradle plugin will obfuscate any build configuration where minifyEnabled is set to true. In these conditions, the New Relic agent will forward the ProGuard map generated for the build to crash collectors, tagged with a unique build ID generated by the agent. Obfuscation is best configured in the application or instant app project that includes other modules as dependencies. Modules may configure ProGuard as needed. Important When using ProGuard or DexGuard with Android apps, follow the procedures to complete the additional, required configuration steps. For more information, see the ProGuard and DexGuard configuration documentation. Troubleshoot auto-instrumentation If you are not whether the agent is auto-instrumenting an instant app project, try running these steps: Build app with debug (-d, --debug) option, and capture the build log. Search the log for evidence of instant apps by looking for either of these terms: This appears to be an Instant App Copy BuildId[1a2b34c5-def6-7890-g123-h4567890a] Copy The agent will add an attribute named 'instantApp' to the app's Insights session attributes if the app appears to be an instant app.",

To initialize mobile monitoring: In the onCreate() method, add this call: NewRelic.withApplicationToken(\"GENERATED_TOKEN\").start(this.getApplication()); Copy Optional: Change the logging level. To build and run your application: Clean your project, then run your app in an emulator or device to generate traffic. Wait a few minutes, then view data for your Android app from the Overview page: Go to one.newrelic.com > Mobile > (select an app). If you have problems with your Android installation, or if you do not see data in the mobile monitoring UI, follow the troubleshooting procedures. Update your Android installation To keep your Android agent up to date, follow the procedures to upgrade the Android agent SDK for New Relic. To install the latest Android version for your mobile app: Go to one.newrelic.com > Mobile > (select an app) > Settings > Installation. Android 4.x: Multidex support New Relic's mobile monitoring for Android versions prior to Android 5.0 (API level 21) use the Dalvik runtime to execute app code. By default, Dalvik limits apps to a single classes.dex bytecode file per APK. In order to get around this limitation, you must enable multidex support. Then you can use the multidex support library, which becomes part of the primary DEX file of your app and then manages access to the additional DEX files and the code they contain. When building each DEX file for a multidex app, the build tools perform complex decision making to determine which classes are needed in the primary DEX file so that your app can start successfully. If any class required during startup is not provided in the primary DEX file, then your app crashes with the error java.lang.NoClassDefFoundError. If you see the java.lang.NoClassDefFoundError error, then you must manually specify these additional classes as required in the primary DEX file: Create a proguard.multidex.config file within the /app folder of your project. Update mypackage to reflect your package name. #################### # keep class names # #################### #Keep New Relic in the main dex -keep class com.newrelic.** { *; } -keep class com.mypackage.activities.** { *; } Copy Merge the following code into the app-level build.gradle file: android { defaultConfig{ … multiDexKeepProguard file(\"proguard.multidex.config\") } } Copy For more information, see the Android Developers documentation on declaring classes required in the primary DEX file.

Check our Android compatibility and requirements, and if you have previously installed the Android agent SDK, follow the steps before upgrading to the latest version with ProGuard or DexGuard. Configure ProGuard To add support for ProGuard: Add an exclusion to your app; for example: To support New Relic instrumentation, add keep class. To disable warnings related to unresolved problems, add dont warn. To preserve line numbers for crash reporting, add LineNumberTable. To preserve stack information for handled exceptions, add SourceFile and EnclosingMethod. Add the following to your ProGuard config file (proguard.cfg, proguard-android.txt, proguard-rules.pro, etc.): -keep class com.newrelic.** { *; } -dontwarn com.newrelic.** -keepattributes Exceptions, Signature, InnerClasses, LineNumberTable, SourceFile, EnclosingMethod Copy Clean and rebuild your project. Run your app in an emulator or device to start seeing data on your mobile app's Overview page. Optional: Use the mobile monitoring Settings page to customize your mobile app. If no data appears, review your logcat output for errors. Network library support New Relic instrumentation happens before ProGuard obfuscates your code. In order for these libraries to be properly instrumented, their classes must not be obfuscated by ProGuard. Here are examples of rules to be applied to preserve these classes. This is not a complete list. Different rules will be needed depending on your library or version. Library Rules Apache Http -keep class org.apache.http.** { *; } -dontwarn org.apache.http.** Copy OkHttp 2 -keep class com.squareup.okhttp.* { *; } -dontwarn com.squareup.okhttp.** -dontwarn okio.** Copy OkHttp 3 -keep class okhttp3.** { *; } -dontwarn okhttp3.** -dontwarn okio.** Copy Retrofit 2 -keep class retrofit2.** { *; } -dontwarn retrofit2.** Copy Configure DexGuard DexGuard uses the same configuration options as ProGuard, and it can read any pre-existing ProGuard configuration files. DexGuard also has its own set of additional configuration options and provides sample configurations for many common app frameworks. To add support for DexGuard: Add DexGuard to your app and set up the Gradle plugin according to the directions from DexGuard. Create a dexguard-project.txt file to hold specific DexGuard configuration options, and add: -dontnote com.newrelic.agent.android.NewRelic -dontnote com.newrelic.agent.android.harvest.crash.Crash Copy After the DexGuard plugin has been configured, check the following.

Then you can use the multidex support library, which becomes part of the primary DEX file of your app and then manages access to the additional DEX files and the code they contain. When building each DEX file for a multidex app, the build tools perform complex decision making to determine which classes are needed in the primary DEX file so that your app can start successfully. If any class required during startup is not provided in the primary DEX file, then your app crashes with the error java.lang.NoClassDefFoundError. If you see the java.lang.NoClassDefFoundError error, then you must manually specify these additional classes as required in the primary DEX file: Create a proguard.multidex.config file within the /app folder of your project. Update mypackage to reflect your package name. #################### # keep class names # #################### #Keep New Relic in the main dex -keep class com.newrelic.** { *; } -keep class com.mypackage.activities.** { *; } Copy Merge the following code into the app-level build.gradle file: android { defaultConfig{ … multiDexKeepProguard file(\"proguard.multidex.config\") } } Copy For more information, see the Android Developers documentation on declaring classes required in the primary DEX file.

The agent will detect when an APK is an instant app. For feature APKs, the agent will inject a unique build ID that instant apps will use when reporting crashes. The side-loaded (main) activity of every feature must call NewRelic.start() when the activity is created (as per normal instructions). ProGuard and Dexguard support for feature and application APKs Place the newrelic.properties file in the root (main) directory of the project. ProGuard and Dexguard support The Android Studio Gradle plugin will obfuscate any build configuration where minifyEnabled is set to true. In these conditions, the New Relic agent will forward the ProGuard map generated for the build to crash collectors, tagged with a unique build ID generated by the agent. Obfuscation is best configured in the application or instant app project that includes other modules as dependencies. Modules may configure ProGuard as needed. Important When using ProGuard or DexGuard with Android apps, follow the procedures to complete the additional, required configuration steps.

Check our Android compatibility and requirements, and if you have previously installed the Android agent SDK, follow the steps before upgrading to the latest version with ProGuard or DexGuard. Configure ProGuard To add support for ProGuard: Add an exclusion to your app; for example: To support New Relic instrumentation, add keep class. To disable warnings related to unresolved problems, add dont warn. To preserve line numbers for crash reporting, add LineNumberTable. To preserve stack information for handled exceptions, add SourceFile and EnclosingMethod. Add the following to your ProGuard config file (proguard.cfg, proguard-android.txt, proguard-rules.pro, etc.): -keep class com.newrelic.** { *; } -dontwarn com.newrelic.** -keepattributes Exceptions, Signature, InnerClasses, LineNumberTable, SourceFile, EnclosingMethod Copy Clean and rebuild your project. Run your app in an emulator or device to start seeing data on your mobile app's Overview page. Optional: Use the mobile monitoring Settings page to customize your mobile app. If no data appears, review your logcat output for errors. Network library support New Relic instrumentation happens before ProGuard obfuscates your code. In order for these libraries to be properly instrumented, their classes must not be obfuscated by ProGuard. Here are examples of rules to be applied to preserve these classes. This is not a complete list. Different rules will be needed depending on your library or version. Library Rules Apache Http -keep class org.apache.http.** { *; } -dontwarn org.apache.http.** Copy OkHttp 2 -keep class com.squareup.okhttp.* { *; } -dontwarn com.squareup.okhttp.** -dontwarn okio.** Copy OkHttp 3 -keep class okhttp3.** { *; } -dontwarn okhttp3.** -dontwarn okio.** Copy Retrofit 2 -keep class retrofit2.** { *; } -dontwarn retrofit2.** Copy Configure DexGuard DexGuard uses the same configuration options as ProGuard, and it can read any pre-existing ProGuard configuration files. DexGuard also has its own set of additional configuration options and provides sample configurations for many common app frameworks. To add support for DexGuard: Add DexGuard to your app and set up the Gradle plugin according to the directions from DexGuard. Create a dexguard-project.txt file to hold specific DexGuard configuration options, and add: -dontnote com.newrelic.agent.android.NewRelic -dontnote com.newrelic.agent.android.harvest.crash.Crash Copy After the DexGuard plugin has been configured, check the following.

This is a 40-character hexadecimal string for authenticating each mobile app you monitor in New Relic. Go to one.newrelic.com > Mobile. If applicable: From the Mobile apps index, select Add a new app. From the Get started page, select Android as the platform for mobile monitoring. Type a meaningful name for your mobile app, and select Continue. Continue with the steps to configure mobile monitoring with Gradle and Android Studio. OR: To complete the configuration process for a new mobile app later: Go to one.newrelic.com > Mobile, then select See instructions next to your mobile app name. To upgrade an existing Android installation: Go to one.newrelic.com > Mobile > (select an app) > Settings > Installation. Configure with Gradle and Android Studio These procedures to configure your Android app with Gradle and Android Studio also appear on the Get started page in New Relic. Merge New Relic's mobile monitoring code in the Gradle & Android Studio tab to your build.gradle file. Project level build.gradle file: In this example, AGENT_VERSION represents your agent version number. See the agent release notes, and use the latest version. buildscript { repositories { mavenCentral() } dependencies { classpath \"com.newrelic.agent.android:agent-gradle-plugin:AGENT_VERSION\" } } Copy App level build.gradle file: In this example, AGENT_VERSION represents your agent version number. See the agent release notes, and use the latest version. repositories { mavenCentral() } apply plugin: 'android' apply plugin: 'newrelic' dependencies { compile 'com.newrelic.agent.android:android-agent:AGENT_VERSION' } Copy ProGuard or DexGuard: In your project’s root directory (projectname/app), add a newrelic.properties file with the following line: com.newrelic.application_token=GENERATED_TOKEN Copy Follow the additional, required configuration steps for using ProGuard or DexGuard with New Relic. Set app permissions: Ensure that your Android app requests INTERNET and ACCESS_NETWORK_STATE permissions by adding these lines to your AndroidManifest.xml file: <uses-permission android:name=\"android.permission.INTERNET\" /> <uses-permission android:name=\"android.permission.ACCESS_NETWORK_STATE\" /> Copy To start New Relic's mobile monitoring agent: In your Default Activity (as defined in your Manifest), import the NewRelic class: import com.newrelic.agent.android.NewRelic; Copy Important We do not support starting the mobile monitoring agent in other classes, as that can cause unexpected or unstable behavior. To initialize mobile monitoring: In the onCreate() method, add this call: NewRelic.withApplicationToken(\"GENERATED_TOKEN\").start(this.getApplication()); Copy Optional: Change the logging level. To build and run your application: Clean your project, then run your app in an emulator or device to generate traffic. Wait a few minutes, then view data for your Android app from the Overview page: Go to one.newrelic.com > Mobile > (select an app). If you have problems with your Android installation, or if you do not see data in the mobile monitoring UI, follow the troubleshooting procedures. Update your Android installation To keep your Android agent up to date, follow the procedures to upgrade the Android agent SDK for New Relic. To install the latest Android version for your mobile app: Go to one.newrelic.com > Mobile > (select an app) > Settings > Installation. Android 4.x: Multidex support New Relic's mobile monitoring for Android versions prior to Android 5.0 (API level 21) use the Dalvik runtime to execute app code. By default, Dalvik limits apps to a single classes.dex bytecode file per APK. In order to get around this limitation, you must enable multidex support. Then you can use the multidex support library, which becomes part of the primary DEX file of your app and then manages access to the additional DEX files and the code they contain. When building each DEX file for a multidex app, the build tools perform complex decision making to determine which classes are needed in the primary DEX file so that your app can start successfully. If any class required during startup is not provided in the primary DEX file, then your app crashes with the error java.lang.NoClassDefFoundError. If you see the java.lang.NoClassDefFoundError error, then you must manually specify these additional classes as required in the primary DEX file: Create a proguard.multidex.config file within the /app folder of your project. Update mypackage to reflect your package name. #################### # keep class names # #################### #Keep New Relic in the main dex -keep class com.newrelic.** { *; } -keep class com.mypackage.activities.** { *; } Copy Merge the following code into the app-level build.gradle file: android { defaultConfig{ … multiDexKeepProguard file(\"proguard.multidex.config\") } } Copy For more information, see the Android Developers documentation on declaring classes required in the primary DEX file. New Relic Gradle Plugin configuration For details on how to configure the behavior of the mobile monitoring agent plugin during Gradle builds, see the New Relic Gradle plugin extension guide.",

      "body": "Android Instant Apps allow users to quickly use your applications without installation. With the Android agent version 5.17.0 and higher, you can use New Relic to detect and instrument all feature modules for an instant app. Use this documentation along with the standard New Relic procedures to install Android apps with Gradle and Android Studio. After following the standard installation procedures, follow these additional steps for Android instant apps. Terminology This procedure uses the following terms that are specific to the Android Instant Apps plugin: Module: Any packaged class and/or resource collection APK: A module that packages the apps resources and DEX’ed classes Feature module: A slimmed down module that contains only a subset of the total APK Install the plugin To install the New Relic plugin for Android Instant Apps: First follow the steps in the Install Android apps with Gradle and Android Studio documentation. Apply the agent plugin in every project Gradle build file. List the Android agent as a dependency. Start the agent from each Activity class in the feature that could be side-loaded through a Digital Asset Link intent, (for example, mobile.example.com/signin). Minimal build.gradle example apply plugin: ‘com.android.[application|library|feature|instantapp]' apply plugin: ‘newrelic’ dependencies { implementation \"com.newrelic.agent.android:android-agent:${project.agentVersion}\" } Copy Review the considerations for instrumentation. Instrumentation When instrumenting an instant app, be aware of the following considerations with APKs: Instant apps and APKs Comments Instrumentation Instrumentation of instant apps behaves the same as instrumentation with a normal APK. The agent will detect when an APK is an instant app. For feature APKs, the agent will inject a unique build ID that instant apps will use when reporting crashes. The side-loaded (main) activity of every feature must call NewRelic.start() when the activity is created (as per normal instructions). ProGuard and Dexguard support for feature and application APKs Place the newrelic.properties file in the root (main) directory of the project. ProGuard and Dexguard support The Android Studio Gradle plugin will obfuscate any build configuration where minifyEnabled is set to true. In these conditions, the New Relic agent will forward the ProGuard map generated for the build to crash collectors, tagged with a unique build ID generated by the agent. Obfuscation is best configured in the application or instant app project that includes other modules as dependencies. Modules may configure ProGuard as needed. Important When using ProGuard or DexGuard with Android apps, follow the procedures to complete the additional, required configuration steps. For more information, see the ProGuard and DexGuard configuration documentation. Troubleshoot auto-instrumentation If you are not whether the agent is auto-instrumenting an instant app project, try running these steps: Build app with debug (-d, --debug) option, and capture the build log. Search the log for evidence of instant apps by looking for either of these terms: This appears to be an Instant App Copy BuildId[1a2b34c5-def6-7890-g123-h4567890a] Copy The agent will add an attribute named 'instantApp' to the app's Insights session attributes if the app appears to be an instant app.",

      "body": "Important Starting with version 5.9.0 of the New Relic Android agent, you can set a custom user identifier value to associate user sessions with analytics events and attributes. For more information, see the NewRelic.setUserId method. The Android agent provides an SDK API to set up custom instrumentation for monitoring your application. The API gives you the ability to: Instrument your own code. Create, name, and end interaction traces from events in your mobile app. Record custom metrics. Send custom attributes and events to New Relic Insights. Track networking from libraries not supported automatically. Install the SDK Before using the Android SDK API: Review the Android SDK API release notes to ensure you have your app instrumented with a current SDK for mobile monitoring. Go to one.newrelic.com, click Add more data and then follow the steps for Android. For more information, see the detailed Android installation and configuration procedures. If you need to support Android 2.2, see the legacy Android agent SDK procedures. Instrument your code Caution Tracing is heavily optimized, but it does impose a performance overhead. Avoid instrumenting methods that are expected to be called hundreds of times. If you have custom libraries or application code that you want to include in interaction traces: Use the following Java annotation: import com.newrelic.agent.android.instrumentation.Trace; Copy Add the @Trace annotation to the methods you want to instrument: @Trace public void myHeavyweightMethod() { … Copy To indicate what kind of method is being traced, use the optional category attribute. Automatically instrumented methods Automatic instrumentation is one of the agent's more convenient features. However, if it interferes with the method being traced, add @SkipTrace to the method, and the agent will skip it during compile time instrumentation. Classes Methods Activity onCreate onCreateView AsyncTask execute executeOnExecutor BitmapFactory decodeFile decodeResourceStream decodeResource decodeByteArray decodeStream decodeFileDescriptor decodeResourceStream SQLiteDatabase query queryWithFactory rawQuery rawQueryWithFactory insert insertOrThrow insertWithOnConflict replace replaceOrThrow delete update updateWithOnConflict execSql GSON toJson fromJson JSONObject <init> toString JSONArray <init> toString Category attribute example The category can be a custom name, or it can be one of the predefined MetricCategory enums (listed below). Here is an example of instrumenting an image processing method using the predefined IMAGE category: @Trace(category = MetricCategory.IMAGE) public void processImageData() { … Copy Available MetricCategory enums include: MetricCategory Description VIEW_LOADING Creating sub views, controls, and other related tasks VIEW_LAYOUT Inflation of layouts, resolving components DATABASE SQLite and other file I/O IMAGE Image loading and processing JSON JSON parsing or creation NETWORK Web service integration methods, remote resource loading Use the API methods The following table lists all the New Relic Android SDK API calls, ordered by common use cases. If you want to... Do this Track app activity that may be helpful for troubleshooting crashes See recordBreadcrumb. Track a method as an interaction See startInteraction. Name or rename an interaction See setInteractionName. End an interaction See endInteraction. Disable or enable all interactions See withInteractionTracing. Set an app version associated with an interaction See withApplicationVersion. Set custom build ID See withApplicationBuild. Create custom metrics See recordMetric. Report custom attributes and events There are several ways to add custom attributes and events. For more about which would be the best method to use and why, see Add custom data. Create an attribute: setAttribute Increment an attribute count: incrementAttribute Remove an attribute: removeAttribute Remove all attributes: removeAllAttributes Record custom event: recordCustomEvent Record a breadcrumb event: recordBreadcrumb Set the maximum size of an event pool: setMaxEventPoolSize Set maximum time agent stores events in memory: setMaxEventBufferTime Return the current session's ID: currentSessionId Set custom user ID for associating sessions with events and attributes: setUserId Track custom network requests and failures Use these methods: Record HTTP transactions at varying levels of detail: See noticeHttpTransaction. Record network failures: See noticeNetworkFailure. Record a handled exception as an event, including context See recordHandledException(). Manual cross application tracing The noticeHttpTransaction code does not automatically append the appropriate header ID value needed to get cross application tracing to work. This is why you will not see the application link in your Android app on New Relic's Map page for mobile apps or on the HTTP requests page. You can use a public method in the New Relic Android SDK to get the appropriate ID to pass along with your HTTP request to your back-end application, as long as it is already instrumented by New Relic. The appropriate header ID will be passed from the back-end application in the response, providing everything needed for cross application tracing to function. Cross application tracing example This example adds the NewRelic-ID to the back-end HTTP request, with conn as the external HTTP connection. (Notice the additional import.) import com.newrelic.agent.android.NewRelic; import com.newrelic.agent.android.Agent; //required for getCrossProcessId() ... ... //new method for appending the crossProcessID necessary for CAT in New Relic public static void setCrossProcessHeader(HttpURLConnection conn) { String crossProcessId = Agent.getCrossProcessId(); // API call into the agent for the X-NewRelic-ID if (crossProcessId != null) { conn.setRequestProperty(\"X-NewRelic-ID\", crossProcessId); } } Copy After adding the appropriate header to the request to the back-end app, the response from the app needs to be parsed for the X-Newrelic-App-Data header, and then added to the noticeHttpTransaction call as a string. For example: //NewRelic.noticeHttpTransaction(url, httpMethod, statusCode, startTimeMs, endTimeMs, bytesSent, bytesReceived, responseBody, params, response); //Where xNewRelicAppDataHeader is the value of the X-NewRelic-App-Data header NewRelic.noticeHttpTransaction(\"http://api.newrelic.com\", \"GET\", 200, System.nanoTime(), System.nanoTime(),100 ,100, \"Test\", new HashMap<String, String>(), xNewRelicAppDataHeader); Copy",

Then, view the custom events that you created in NRQL or dashboards. Network requests Enable the MobileRequest event feature so you can perform a full network analysis. To further investigate network request error rates and response times, query MobileRequest and MobileRequestError events. Crash analysis Review detailed information using groups and filters to analyze trends that lead to crashes. To view more information about crashes, create NRQL queries to review Insights charts related to crash data. Android SDK API Use the Android SDK API for mobile monitoring to instrument parts of your code that are not instrumented by default. Then, view those custom events and attributes in New Relic Insights. Handled exceptions Report exceptions so you can identify factors creating a poor mobile app experience. To further improve performance, review MobileHandledException event records in New Relic Insights. Breadcrumbs Boost the level of detail in crash event trails by adding breadcrumbs. Then, query MobileBreadcrumbs events to see all breadcrumbs or just breadcrumbs related to crashes.

With the Android agent version 5.17.0 and higher, you can use New Relic to detect and instrument all feature modules for an instant app. Use this documentation along with the standard New Relic procedures to install Android apps with Gradle and Android Studio. After following the standard installation procedures, follow these additional steps for Android instant apps. Terminology This procedure uses the following terms that are specific to the Android Instant Apps plugin: Module: Any packaged class and/or resource collection APK: A module that packages the apps resources and DEX’ed classes Feature module: A slimmed down module that contains only a subset of the total APK Install the plugin To install the New Relic plugin for Android Instant Apps: First follow the steps in the Install Android apps with Gradle and Android Studio documentation. Apply the agent plugin in every project Gradle build file. List the Android agent as a dependency. Start the agent from each Activity class in the feature that could be side-loaded through a Digital Asset Link intent, (for example, mobile.example.com/signin). Minimal build.gradle example apply plugin: ‘com.android.[application|library|feature|instantapp]' apply plugin: ‘newrelic’ dependencies { implementation \"com.newrelic.agent.android:android-agent:${project.agentVersion}\" } Copy Review the considerations for instrumentation. Instrumentation When instrumenting an instant app, be aware of the following considerations with APKs: Instant apps and APKs Comments Instrumentation Instrumentation of instant apps behaves the same as instrumentation with a normal APK. The agent will detect when an APK is an instant app. For feature APKs, the agent will inject a unique build ID that instant apps will use when reporting crashes. The side-loaded (main) activity of every feature must call NewRelic.start() when the activity is created (as per normal instructions). ProGuard and Dexguard support for feature and application APKs Place the newrelic.properties file in the root (main) directory of the project. ProGuard and Dexguard support The Android Studio Gradle plugin will obfuscate any build configuration where minifyEnabled is set to true. In these conditions, the New Relic agent will forward the ProGuard map generated for the build to crash collectors, tagged with a unique build ID generated by the agent. Obfuscation is best configured in the application or instant app project that includes other modules as dependencies. Modules may configure ProGuard as needed. Important When using ProGuard or DexGuard with Android apps, follow the procedures to complete the additional, required configuration steps. For more information, see the ProGuard and DexGuard configuration documentation. Troubleshoot auto-instrumentation If you are not whether the agent is auto-instrumenting an instant app project, try running these steps: Build app with debug (-d, --debug) option, and capture the build log. Search the log for evidence of instant apps by looking for either of these terms: This appears to be an Instant App Copy BuildId[1a2b34c5-def6-7890-g123-h4567890a] Copy The agent will add an attribute named 'instantApp' to the app's Insights session attributes if the app appears to be an instant app.",

As a full platform user you get access to our entire set of observability tools. All our tools are interconnected and accessible in New Relic One. All the data you bring to New Relic through agents and integrations are metrics, events, logs, and traces that feed our platform's analytics and monitoring capabilities. New Relic links your data in a meaningful way so that you can explore it, build dashboards, and set up alerts. Our out-of-the-box observability UI experiences allow to visualize, analyze, and troubleshoot your entire software stack in one unified platform. The New Relic Explorer consolidates all the entities in your system, and how they're connected, in a single place, so you can easily detect performance trends and issues. By automatically connecting infrastructure health with application performance and end-user behavior, you can cut through the noise to find useful signals. Troubleshoot from anywhere in your stack Being fully-connected, the New Relic UI allows you to start your observability journey from any element of your stack. For example, you can get to crucial infrastructure logs from traces of an application running on a problematic Kubernetes pod. Use the Explorer in New Relic One to access and observe the full stack of your software, see performance data and alerting status at a glance, and check relationships. We provide you with a simple, yet powerful visual tool to monitor all your entities, that is, anything we can identify that reports data. In the New Relic ecosystem, entities include basic components like applications, hosts, containers, or database services, but it can also refer to custom groupings of such elements. You can also create your own entities. The more entities you instrument, the more data you'll bring in. The more data you've brought to New Relic, the more you'll understand your metrics, events, logs, and traces. Here are some examples of UI paths you might follow to drill into your data: You want to instrument...

      "body": "NerdGraph is our GraphQL-format API that lets you query New Relic data and configure some New Relic features. After you sign up for a free New Relic account and install any of our monitoring services, you can get started with NerdGraph. What is NerdGraph? New Relic has several APIs. NerdGraph is the API we recommend for querying New Relic data and for performing some specific configurations (learn more about features). NerdGraph provides a single API interface for returning data from New Relic’s various APIs and microservices. Over time, other configuration capabilities will be added to NerdGraph. Important NerdGraph isn’t used for data ingest. For that, you'd use our data ingest APIs. NerdGraph is built using GraphQL, which is an open source API format that allows you to request exactly the data needed, with no over-fetching or under-fetching. For a lesson in how to use NerdGraph, watch this 7-minute video: Want to watch more video tutorials? Go to the New Relic University’s Intro to NerdGraph. Or see the online course on New Relic APIs. Use the GraphiQL explorer To get started using GraphQL, we recommend playing around with our GraphiQL explorer (GraphiQL is an open source graphical interface for using GraphQL). You can use it to explore our data schema, to read built-in object definitions, and to build and execute queries. To use GraphQL, you’ll need a user-specific New Relic API key called a user key. You can generate one or find an existing one from the GraphiQL explorer’s API key dropdown. To find the GraphiQL explorer: If your New Relic account uses an EU data center, go to api.eu.newrelic.com/graphiql. Otherwise use api.newrelic.com/graphiql. For tips on how to build queries, see Build queries. Requirements and endpoints To use NerdGraph, you need a New Relic user key, which can be generated and accessed from the GraphiQL explorer. The endpoints are: Main endpoint: https://api.newrelic.com/graphql Endpoint for accounts using EU data center: https://api.eu.newrelic.com/graphql To access the endpoint, use the following cURL command: curl -X POST https://api.newrelic.com/graphql \\ -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \\ -H 'API-Key: YOUR_NEW_RELIC_USER_KEY' \\ -d '{ \"query\": \"{ requestContext { userId apiKey } }\" } ' Copy What can you do with NerdGraph? NerdGraph functionality can be broken down into two main categories: Querying New Relic data. You can fetch data for a variety of purposes, including using it in a programmatic workflow, or building a New Relic One app for custom data visualizations. Configuring New Relic features. There are a variety of configurations available and more will be added over time. You can do things like add tags, configure workloads, or customize \"golden metrics.\" You can use NerdGraph to return a wide range of New Relic data but we’ve created some tutorials for common use cases: Topic Tutorials Your monitored entities Get data about entities Understand entity relationships and dependencies (used to build service maps) Query and configure \"golden metrics\" (important entity metrics) Querying data Query using NRQL (our query language) Tags Add and manage tags APM agents APM agent configuration Dashboards Create dashboards Export dashboards to other accounts Export dashboards as files Migrate from Insights Dashboard API to NerdGraph Alerts See all alert-related tutorials Applied Intelligence View and configure topology Workloads View and configure workloads Service Levels Configure and manage Service Levels Manage keys Create and manage keys (license keys used for data ingest, and user keys) Manage data Convert event data to metric data Drop data Distributed tracing Query distributed tracing data Configure Infinite Tracing New Relic One apps Build a New Relic One app Cloud integrations (AWS, Azure, GCP) Configure cloud integrations Partners and resellers Manage subscriptions (only for partners using original pricing model) Data partitions Manage data partitions Date retention Manage data retention NerdGraph terminology The following are terms that originate with GraphQL (the API format NerdGraph uses). Term Definition Queries and mutations There are two classes of GraphQL operations: Queries are basic requests used only to fetch data. These queries are not static, meaning that you can ask for more data or less data, depending on your needs. For each query, you can specify exactly what data you want to retrieve, as long as it is supported by the schema. Mutations are requests that perform an action, such as creating a resource or changing configuration. Mutations require the keyword mutation, as well as the name of the mutation. Type Data in GraphQL is organized into types. Types can be scalars (like strings, numbers, or booleans) or object types. An object type is a custom type made up of a collection of fields. For example, an object type called User may represent a user in a system. Field A field represents a piece of information on an object type that can be queried. Fields can be scalars, lists, or objects. For example, a User object type could have a string field called name. Interface An interface is an abstract type that represents a collection of common fields that other object types can implement. Tips on using the GraphiQL explorer You can make queries with the NerdGraph GraphiQL explorer. The explorer provides built-in schema definitions and features, including auto-complete and query validation. Query accounts a New Relic user can access You can query for the name of an account that an actor (a New Relic authorized user) has access to: query { actor { account(id: YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID) { name } } } Copy The response will mirror the query structure you defined in the request, making it easy to ask for the specific data that you want. { \"data\": { \"actor\": { \"account\": { \"name\": \"Data Nerd\" } } } } Copy Query user, account, and NRQL in one request The graph structure shows its capabilities when queries become more complex. For example, you can query for user information, account information, and make a NRQL query with one request. With REST API, this would take three different requests to three different endpoints. query { actor { account(id: YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID) { name nrql(query: \"SELECT * FROM Transaction\") { results } } user { name id } } } Copy",

      "body": "Your app's dSYM files are stored in Xcode's dSYM archive path folder. This is the folder where the iOS agent gets the dSYM files that are used to symbolicate your crash reports. New Relic provides a post-build script as part of the iOS agent's install process and the tvOS agent's install process. This script automatically uploads your app's dSYM files. Automatic script The script automatically uploads dSYM files only for release builds. Non-release builds must upload their files either manually or through the mobile monitoring UI. Bitcode-enabled apps have their dSYM files generated by Apple. You must download the dSYM files for Bitcode-enabled apps from Apple and upload them to New Relic. If you see unreadable machine code in the Crashes page, your dSYM files may not be uploaded correctly. In some cases, you may need to manually upload dSYM files. The automatic script uses Python 2. As of October 2019 with macOS 10.15 (Catalina), Python won't be installed by default. If you're using the automatic script (recommended), you may need to manually install Python 2. If you're using Homebrew, see Python on Homebrew. Identify missing dSYMs When a Bitcode-enabled app is uploaded to Apple for App Store review or ad-hoc distribution, dSYMs need to be manually downloaded from Apple and uploaded to New Relic to allow the mobile crash reports to be properly symbolicated. These dSYMs can be downloaded through the archives organizer in Xcode within several minutes of uploading the app. In this situation follow the procedures to find the archive and download dSYMs. If an app is missing a dSYM file, you'll see three indicators in the mobile monitoring UI: Banner notification: A banner warning appears on the Crash report page. The warning reads: We were unable to locate your dsym. Copy Upload prompt: From the Crash type summary page you will be automatically prompted to upload a dSYM file if it is missing. Machine code: The crash stack trace on the Crash report page displays machine code and not a human-readable error message. Upload dSYM files through the mobile monitoring UI You can easily upload your dSYM files directly from the New Relic One UI. The maximum file size is 600 MB. To upload your dSYM files: Go to one.newrelic.com and click Mobile. Then select your app from the list. View Crash analysis. Select a specific crash from the Crash types list. Click Upload dSYM. You can either drag and drop your dSYMs directly, or select the file form your computer. Manually upload dSYM files In some circumstances, New Relic's automatic upload of dSYM files may fail. If a dSYM upload is attempted and fails, it creates a build error with a detailed message. For example, if there's a network failure and the dSYM upload isn't completed, Xcode will report an error. For additional information about how New Relic handles dSYM uploads, see New Relic's Online Technical Community. If the automatic upload fails, you can manually upload your dSYM file. If you have multiple dSYM files, they can be within a single zip with a maximum file size of 600 MB. The YOUR_NEW_RELIC_APPLICATION_TOKEN value in the commands below is the same key used for +[NewRelic startWithApplicationToken:] (in Objective-C) or NewRelic.start(withApplicationToken:) (in Swift). To manually upload your dSYM files: Via Python script (agent versions 6.0.0 or higher) In iOS agent versions 6.0.0 or higher, the agent includes a Python script that automatically processes and uploads symbols. You can call this script from the command line: NewRelicAgent.framework/Resources/generateMap.py \"DSYM_ARCHIVE_PATH\" \"YOUR_NEW_RELIC_APPLICATION_TOKEN\" Copy Via command line To manually upload individual dSYM files from the command line: Zip up your dSYM file or files using the following command. Replace ~ /ZIPPED_DSYM_PATH with your new dSYM archive path and file name (for example, Users/my-name/desktop). Also replace ~ /dSYM_PATH with your existing dSYM file path. /usr/bin/zip --recurse-paths --quiet \"~/ZIPPED_DSYM_PATH\" \"~/dSYM_PATH\" Copy Upload the dSYM zip file using the following command: For US accounts: curl -F dsym=@\"~/DSYM_ZIP_PATH\" -H \"X-APP-LICENSE-KEY: YOUR_NEW_RELIC_APPLICATION_TOKEN\" https://mobile-symbol-upload.newrelic.com/symbol Copy For EU accounts: curl -F dsym=@\"~/DSYM_ZIP_PATH\" -H \"X-APP-LICENSE-KEY: YOUR_NEW_RELIC_APPLICATION_TOKEN\" https://mobile-symbol-upload.eu01.nr-data.net/symbol Copy Troubleshooting Auto-upload failure If a dSYM auto-upload failed, the Report Navigator may have a fully formed cURL command. You can use this cURL command to reattempt an upload. Depending on the error, you may also need to follow some of the dSYM manual upload steps. Here is an example of a successful dSYM upload in the Report Navigator: Example: A successful dSYM upload in the Report Navigator. Missing dSYMs If dSYM files are missing, you may need to check Xcode build settings to ensure the file is being generated. Frameworks which are built locally have separate build settings and may need to be updated as well.

Foreground monitoring The iOS agent only monitors your app while it is in the foreground. The agent does not monitor background services while the app is closed. For more information, see our Mobile data privacy and security documentation. iOS requirements Make sure your iOS app meets these requirements: Component iOS application requirements Operating system iOS 9 or higher For Bitcode support, use SDK version 5.3.0 or higher. API/SDK NSURLConnection and AFNetworking are supported. NSURLSession supports upload and data tags only. ASIHttpRequest networking APIs are deprecated as of iOS agent version 5.8.2. Network traffic for UIWebView and WKWebView is supported. However, WKWebView Transfer size and Http errors are not supported. Languages Objective-C Swift: Works with both network traces and crash reporting, but no interaction traces by default. Interaction traces must be enabled for Swift. Devices Any iOS compatible device: iPhones, iPads, etc. File sizes The agent adds about 2 to 12 megabytes to your iOS release app, depending on platform build. Architectures ARM 64-bit. SHA-2 As a standard security measure for data collection, New Relic requires that your application server supports SHA-2 (256-bit). SHA-1 is not supported. Xcode To take advantage of New Relic's iOS features, make sure you have the latest version of Xcode. arm64e support To be able to properly symbolicate crashes from devices with arm64e architectures, make sure your Xcode settings are enabled for pointer authentication. For more information, see the Apple developer documentation. CocoaPods In order to use the latest XCFramework Agent, use CocoaPods version 1.10.1 or higher. Testing is not supported Our agents are designed and tested to work in a normal app lifecycle. New Relic does not support running any testing environment on applications with the agent. Testing can cause conflicts and unpredictable behavior. Potential method replacement conflicts Our iOS agent utilizes method replacement during run time. This may result in a conflict with other libraries that also implement method replacement, such as ReactiveCocoa, Firebase, Aspects, and AppleGuice.",

Machine code: The crash stack trace on the Crash report page displays machine code and not a human-readable error message. Upload dSYM files through the mobile monitoring UI You can easily upload your dSYM files directly from the New Relic One UI. The maximum file size is 600 MB. To upload your dSYM files: Go to one.newrelic.com and click Mobile. Then select your app from the list. View Crash analysis. Select a specific crash from the Crash types list. Click Upload dSYM. You can either drag and drop your dSYMs directly, or select the file form your computer. Manually upload dSYM files In some circumstances, New Relic's automatic upload of dSYM files may fail. If a dSYM upload is attempted and fails, it creates a build error with a detailed message. For example, if there's a network failure and the dSYM upload isn't completed, Xcode will report an error. For additional information about how New Relic handles dSYM uploads, see New Relic's Online Technical Community. If the automatic upload fails, you can manually upload your dSYM file. If you have multiple dSYM files, they can be within a single zip with a maximum file size of 600 MB. The YOUR_NEW_RELIC_APPLICATION_TOKEN value in the commands below is the same key used for +[NewRelic startWithApplicationToken:] (in Objective-C) or NewRelic.start(withApplicationToken:) (in Swift). To manually upload your dSYM files: Via Python script (agent versions 6.0.0 or higher) In iOS agent versions 6.0.0 or higher, the agent includes a Python script that automatically processes and uploads symbols. You can call this script from the command line: NewRelicAgent.framework/Resources/generateMap.py \"DSYM_ARCHIVE_PATH\" \"YOUR_NEW_RELIC_APPLICATION_TOKEN\" Copy Via command line To manually upload individual dSYM files from the command line: Zip up your dSYM file or files using the following command. Replace ~ /ZIPPED_DSYM_PATH with your new dSYM archive path and file name (for example, Users/my-name/desktop). Also replace ~ /dSYM_PATH with your existing dSYM file path. /usr/bin/zip --recurse-paths --quiet \"~/ZIPPED_DSYM_PATH\" \"~/dSYM_PATH\" Copy Upload the dSYM zip file using the following command: For US accounts: curl -F dsym=@\"~/DSYM_ZIP_PATH\" -H \"X-APP-LICENSE-KEY: YOUR_NEW_RELIC_APPLICATION_TOKEN\" https://mobile-symbol-upload.newrelic.com/symbol Copy For EU accounts: curl -F dsym=@\"~/DSYM_ZIP_PATH\" -H \"X-APP-LICENSE-KEY: YOUR_NEW_RELIC_APPLICATION_TOKEN\" https://mobile-symbol-upload.eu01.nr-data.net/symbol Copy Troubleshooting Auto-upload failure If a dSYM auto-upload failed, the Report Navigator may have a fully formed cURL command. You can use this cURL command to reattempt an upload. Depending on the error, you may also need to follow some of the dSYM manual upload steps. Here is an example of a successful dSYM upload in the Report Navigator: Example: A successful dSYM upload in the Report Navigator. Missing dSYMs If dSYM files are missing, you may need to check Xcode build settings to ensure the file is being generated. Frameworks which are built locally have separate build settings and may need to be updated as well. Build settings: Debug Information Format : Dwarf with dSYM File Deployment Postprocessing: Yes Strip Linked Product: Yes Strip Debug Symbols During Copy : Yes Copy",

      "body": "Your app's dSYM files are stored in Xcode's dSYM archive path folder. This is the folder where the iOS agent gets the dSYM files that are used to symbolicate your crash reports. New Relic provides a post-build script as part of the iOS agent's install process and the tvOS agent's install process. This script automatically uploads your app's dSYM files. Automatic script The script automatically uploads dSYM files only for release builds. Non-release builds must upload their files either manually or through the mobile monitoring UI. Bitcode-enabled apps have their dSYM files generated by Apple. You must download the dSYM files for Bitcode-enabled apps from Apple and upload them to New Relic. If you see unreadable machine code in the Crashes page, your dSYM files may not be uploaded correctly. In some cases, you may need to manually upload dSYM files. The automatic script uses Python 2. As of October 2019 with macOS 10.15 (Catalina), Python won't be installed by default. If you're using the automatic script (recommended), you may need to manually install Python 2. If you're using Homebrew, see Python on Homebrew. Identify missing dSYMs When a Bitcode-enabled app is uploaded to Apple for App Store review or ad-hoc distribution, dSYMs need to be manually downloaded from Apple and uploaded to New Relic to allow the mobile crash reports to be properly symbolicated. These dSYMs can be downloaded through the archives organizer in Xcode within several minutes of uploading the app. In this situation follow the procedures to find the archive and download dSYMs. If an app is missing a dSYM file, you'll see three indicators in the mobile monitoring UI: Banner notification: A banner warning appears on the Crash report page. The warning reads: We were unable to locate your dsym. Copy Upload prompt: From the Crash type summary page you will be automatically prompted to upload a dSYM file if it is missing. Machine code: The crash stack trace on the Crash report page displays machine code and not a human-readable error message. Upload dSYM files through the mobile monitoring UI You can easily upload your dSYM files directly from the New Relic One UI. The maximum file size is 600 MB. To upload your dSYM files: Go to one.newrelic.com and click Mobile. Then select your app from the list. View Crash analysis. Select a specific crash from the Crash types list. Click Upload dSYM. You can either drag and drop your dSYMs directly, or select the file form your computer. Manually upload dSYM files In some circumstances, New Relic's automatic upload of dSYM files may fail. If a dSYM upload is attempted and fails, it creates a build error with a detailed message. For example, if there's a network failure and the dSYM upload isn't completed, Xcode will report an error. For additional information about how New Relic handles dSYM uploads, see New Relic's Online Technical Community. If the automatic upload fails, you can manually upload your dSYM file. If you have multiple dSYM files, they can be within a single zip with a maximum file size of 600 MB. The YOUR_NEW_RELIC_APPLICATION_TOKEN value in the commands below is the same key used for +[NewRelic startWithApplicationToken:] (in Objective-C) or NewRelic.start(withApplicationToken:) (in Swift). To manually upload your dSYM files: Via Python script (agent versions 6.0.0 or higher) In iOS agent versions 6.0.0 or higher, the agent includes a Python script that automatically processes and uploads symbols. You can call this script from the command line: NewRelicAgent.framework/Resources/generateMap.py \"DSYM_ARCHIVE_PATH\" \"YOUR_NEW_RELIC_APPLICATION_TOKEN\" Copy Via command line To manually upload individual dSYM files from the command line: Zip up your dSYM file or files using the following command.

Foreground monitoring The iOS agent only monitors your app while it is in the foreground. The agent does not monitor background services while the app is closed. For more information, see our Mobile data privacy and security documentation. iOS requirements Make sure your iOS app meets these requirements: Component iOS application requirements Operating system iOS 9 or higher For Bitcode support, use SDK version 5.3.0 or higher. API/SDK NSURLConnection and AFNetworking are supported. NSURLSession supports upload and data tags only. ASIHttpRequest networking APIs are deprecated as of iOS agent version 5.8.2. Network traffic for UIWebView and WKWebView is supported. However, WKWebView Transfer size and Http errors are not supported. Languages Objective-C Swift: Works with both network traces and crash reporting, but no interaction traces by default. Interaction traces must be enabled for Swift. Devices Any iOS compatible device: iPhones, iPads, etc. File sizes The agent adds about 2 to 12 megabytes to your iOS release app, depending on platform build. Architectures ARM 64-bit. SHA-2 As a standard security measure for data collection, New Relic requires that your application server supports SHA-2 (256-bit). SHA-1 is not supported. Xcode To take advantage of New Relic's iOS features, make sure you have the latest version of Xcode. arm64e support To be able to properly symbolicate crashes from devices with arm64e architectures, make sure your Xcode settings are enabled for pointer authentication. For more information, see the Apple developer documentation. CocoaPods In order to use the latest XCFramework Agent, use CocoaPods version 1.10.1 or higher. Testing is not supported Our agents are designed and tested to work in a normal app lifecycle. New Relic does not support running any testing environment on applications with the agent. Testing can cause conflicts and unpredictable behavior. Potential method replacement conflicts Our iOS agent utilizes method replacement during run time. This may result in a conflict with other libraries that also implement method replacement, such as ReactiveCocoa, Firebase, Aspects, and AppleGuice.",

Foreground monitoring The iOS agent only monitors your app while it is in the foreground. The agent does not monitor background services while the app is closed. For more information, see our Mobile data privacy and security documentation. iOS requirements Make sure your iOS app meets these requirements: Component iOS application requirements Operating system iOS 9 or higher For Bitcode support, use SDK version 5.3.0 or higher. API/SDK NSURLConnection and AFNetworking are supported. NSURLSession supports upload and data tags only. ASIHttpRequest networking APIs are deprecated as of iOS agent version 5.8.2. Network traffic for UIWebView and WKWebView is supported. However, WKWebView Transfer size and Http errors are not supported. Languages Objective-C Swift: Works with both network traces and crash reporting, but no interaction traces by default. Interaction traces must be enabled for Swift. Devices Any iOS compatible device: iPhones, iPads, etc. File sizes The agent adds about 2 to 12 megabytes to your iOS release app, depending on platform build. Architectures ARM 64-bit. SHA-2 As a standard security measure for data collection, New Relic requires that your application server supports SHA-2 (256-bit). SHA-1 is not supported. Xcode To take advantage of New Relic's iOS features, make sure you have the latest version of Xcode. arm64e support To be able to properly symbolicate crashes from devices with arm64e architectures, make sure your Xcode settings are enabled for pointer authentication. For more information, see the Apple developer documentation. CocoaPods In order to use the latest XCFramework Agent, use CocoaPods version 1.10.1 or higher. Testing is not supported Our agents are designed and tested to work in a normal app lifecycle. New Relic does not support running any testing environment on applications with the agent. Testing can cause conflicts and unpredictable behavior. Potential method replacement conflicts Our iOS agent utilizes method replacement during run time. This may result in a conflict with other libraries that also implement method replacement, such as ReactiveCocoa, Firebase, Aspects, and AppleGuice.",

For more about this process, see Apple's Bitcode and app thinning documentation. When Apple compiles an app, the dSYM files are also compiled. For New Relic to be able to symbolicate crashes of your Bitcode-enabled app, these dSYM files need to be downloaded from Apple and then uploaded to New Relic. Identify missing dSYMs When a Bitcode-enabled app is uploaded to Apple for App Store review or ad-hoc distribution, dSYMs need to be manually downloaded from Apple and uploaded to New Relic to allow the mobile crash reports to be properly symbolicated. These dSYMs can be downloaded through the archives organizer in Xcode within several minutes of uploading the app. In this situation follow the procedures to find the archive and download dSYMs. If an app is missing a dSYM file, you'll see three indicators in the mobile monitoring UI: Banner notification: A banner warning appears on the Crash report page. The warning reads: We were unable to locate your dsym. Copy Upload prompt: from the Crash type summary page you will be automatically prompted to upload a dSYM file if it is missing. Machine code: The crash stack trace on the Crash report page displays machine code and not a human-readable error message. Download dSYM files using iTunes Connect To download the dSYM files you need for your app: Log in to Apple iTunes Connect. Select My Apps > (selected app) > Activity. From the list of builds for your application, select the build number you need for the dSYM. Select Download dSYM. Then, to upload the resulting zip file directly to New Relic: Follow the instructions to manually upload dSYM, and skip step 1. Unpack one dSYM contained in this zip file to retrieve a build UUID that you can upload. (Follow the last step in the manual upload instructions.) Once New Relic receives the zip file, the build UUIDs for all other dSYMs contained in that zip file will be identified. Download dSYM files using Xcode's app archive Use the app version and build number to identify the applicable app archive in the Xcode Organizer and download the dSYMs. Using Xcode to download dSYMs: From the Archives tab, select the app and version/build, then select Download dSYMs. Open the Xcode Organizer: From the Xcode menu, select Window > Organizer > Archives > (select a mobile app). From Version, select the archive that matches the app version (listed first) and build number (following the app version in parentheses). Select Download dSYMs. The dSYMs will be downloaded from Apple if available and if the file names contain a series of letters and numbers. If the dSYM files are named after the the dependencies in your project, the download will not be successful. Upload dSYMs Once you have located the dSYMs, follow the instructions to upload a dSYM for each zipped dSYM.",

Install the agent As part of the installation process, New Relic automatically generates an application token. This is a 40-character hexadecimal string for authenticating each mobile app that you monitor. There are two ways you can install the iOS agent: We recommend you install and configure the iOS agent using the CocoaPods installation method. You can also manually install and configure the iOS agent by adding the New Relic framework to your app. Extend your instrumentation After you install the agent, you can extend the agent's default instrumentation with various types of custom data: To access: In the mobile UI: In New Relic One dashboards: Custom data Create and record custom events, interaction traces, and attributes to add details to your existing data and traces. You can also query the custom events that you created in New Relic One dashboards and NRQL. Network requests Enable the MobileRequest event feature so you can perform a full network analysis. To further investigate network request error rates and response times, query MobileRequest and MobileRequestError events. Crash analysis Review detailed information using groups and filters to analyze trends that lead to crashes. To view more information about crashes, create NRQL queries to review Insights charts related to crash data. iOS SDK API Use the iOS SDK API to instrument parts of your code that are not instrumented by default. Then, view those custom events and attributes in New Relic Insights. Handled exceptions Report exceptions so you can identify factors creating a poor mobile app experience. To further improve performance, review MobileHandledException event records in New Relic Insights. Breadcrumbs Boost the level of detail in crash event trails by adding breadcrumbs. Then, query MobileBreadcrumbs events to see all breadcrumbs or just breadcrumbs related to crashes.

Foreground monitoring The iOS agent only monitors your app while it is in the foreground. The agent does not monitor background services while the app is closed. For more information, see our Mobile data privacy and security documentation. iOS requirements Make sure your iOS app meets these requirements: Component iOS application requirements Operating system iOS 9 or higher For Bitcode support, use SDK version 5.3.0 or higher. API/SDK NSURLConnection and AFNetworking are supported. NSURLSession supports upload and data tags only. ASIHttpRequest networking APIs are deprecated as of iOS agent version 5.8.2. Network traffic for UIWebView and WKWebView is supported. However, WKWebView Transfer size and Http errors are not supported. Languages Objective-C Swift: Works with both network traces and crash reporting, but no interaction traces by default. Interaction traces must be enabled for Swift. Devices Any iOS compatible device: iPhones, iPads, etc. File sizes The agent adds about 2 to 12 megabytes to your iOS release app, depending on platform build. Architectures ARM 64-bit. SHA-2 As a standard security measure for data collection, New Relic requires that your application server supports SHA-2 (256-bit). SHA-1 is not supported. Xcode To take advantage of New Relic's iOS features, make sure you have the latest version of Xcode. arm64e support To be able to properly symbolicate crashes from devices with arm64e architectures, make sure your Xcode settings are enabled for pointer authentication. For more information, see the Apple developer documentation. CocoaPods In order to use the latest XCFramework Agent, use CocoaPods version 1.10.1 or higher. Testing is not supported Our agents are designed and tested to work in a normal app lifecycle. New Relic does not support running any testing environment on applications with the agent. Testing can cause conflicts and unpredictable behavior. Potential method replacement conflicts Our iOS agent utilizes method replacement during run time. This may result in a conflict with other libraries that also implement method replacement, such as ReactiveCocoa, Firebase, Aspects, and AppleGuice.",

Foreground monitoring The iOS agent only monitors your app while it is in the foreground. The agent does not monitor background services while the app is closed. For more information, see our Mobile data privacy and security documentation. iOS requirements Make sure your iOS app meets these requirements: Component iOS application requirements Operating system iOS 9 or higher For Bitcode support, use SDK version 5.3.0 or higher. API/SDK NSURLConnection and AFNetworking are supported. NSURLSession supports upload and data tags only. ASIHttpRequest networking APIs are deprecated as of iOS agent version 5.8.2. Network traffic for UIWebView and WKWebView is supported. However, WKWebView Transfer size and Http errors are not supported. Languages Objective-C Swift: Works with both network traces and crash reporting, but no interaction traces by default. Interaction traces must be enabled for Swift. Devices Any iOS compatible device: iPhones, iPads, etc. File sizes The agent adds about 2 to 12 megabytes to your iOS release app, depending on platform build. Architectures ARM 64-bit. SHA-2 As a standard security measure for data collection, New Relic requires that your application server supports SHA-2 (256-bit). SHA-1 is not supported. Xcode To take advantage of New Relic's iOS features, make sure you have the latest version of Xcode. arm64e support To be able to properly symbolicate crashes from devices with arm64e architectures, make sure your Xcode settings are enabled for pointer authentication. For more information, see the Apple developer documentation. CocoaPods In order to use the latest XCFramework Agent, use CocoaPods version 1.10.1 or higher. Testing is not supported Our agents are designed and tested to work in a normal app lifecycle. New Relic does not support running any testing environment on applications with the agent. Testing can cause conflicts and unpredictable behavior. Potential method replacement conflicts Our iOS agent utilizes method replacement during run time. This may result in a conflict with other libraries that also implement method replacement, such as ReactiveCocoa, Firebase, Aspects, and AppleGuice.",

      "body": "If you are running our Kubernetes integration with a proxy, you need to configure each component (the infrastructure agent, logging, Kubernetes events, etc.) to correctly work with your proxy. Install the infrastructure agent with a proxy There are three options to install the infrastructure agent with a proxy: Installing with chart newrelic-infrastructure: The proxy can be configured setting the configuration option config.proxy as described in the values.yaml of the chart. The whole config object is used to generate a configMap that is mounted as the file /etc/newrelic-infra.yml used to configure the agent. Installing with chart nri-bundle as a dependency: The proxy can be configured setting the configuration option newrelic-infrastructure.config.proxy. The configuration option is passed down to the dependency newrelic-infrastructure modifying the values.yaml of nri-bundle: newrelic-infrastructure.config.proxy: https://user:password@hostname:port Copy Installing with manifest: When installing through the manifest, the proxy can be configured adding the NRIA_PROXY environment variable to the environment variable section of the DaemonSet configuration. The environment variable NRIA_VERBOSE in the DaemonSet YAML can be used as an example of the environment variable configuration. Set logging with a proxy If you’re using log forwarding for the Kubernetes integration, the plugin automatically detects the HTTP_PROXY and HTTPS_PROXY environment variables, and automatically uses them to set up the proxy configuration. For more information, see how to customize the proxy, or bypass it. Install Kubernetes events with a proxy There are three options to install the Kubernetes events integration with a proxy: Installing with chart nri-kube-events: The proxy can be configured setting the configuration option proxy in the values.yaml file. If set, the variable NRIA_PROXY will be added into the deployment.yaml template. Installing with chart nri-bundle as a dependency: The proxy can be configured setting the configuration option nri-kube-events.proxy. The configuration option is passed down to the dependency nri-kube-events modifying the values.yaml of nri-bundle: nri-kube-events.proxy: https://user:password@hostname:port Copy Installing with manifest: When installing through the manifest, to configure the proxy set the NRIA_PROXY in the environment variable section of the infra container. Check the deployment template of the chart as an example of environment variable configuration. Install the Prometheus OpenMetrics integration with a proxy There are three options to install the Prometheus OpenMetric integration with a proxy: Installing with charts nri-prometheus: The proxy can be configured setting the configuration option config.emitter_proxy in the values.yaml. The config object is used to generate a configMap that mounted into the deployment under /etc/nri-prometheus/. Installing with chart nri-bundle as a dependency: The proxy can be configured setting the configuration option nri-prometheus.config.emitter_proxy. The configuration option is passed down to the dependency nri-prometheus modifying the values.yaml of nri-bundle: nri-prometheus.config.emitter_proxy: \"http://localhost:8888 Copy Installing with the manifest: Configure the proxy uncommenting the emitter_proxy option directly in the manifest: # Proxy to be used by the emitters when submitting metrics.

      "body": "Our PHP agent auto-instruments your code so you can start monitoring applications. You can use our guided installation for an automated install, or follow the instructions in this document to complete a basic PHP agent installation. Either way, you need a New Relic account. (It's free, forever.) Get an account Start guided install EU guided install PHP components Our PHP agent consists of two basic components: A PHP extension, which collects data from your application A local proxy daemon, which transmits the data to New Relic Your system's configuration components, including the web server, operating system, system permissions, PHP installation itself, package manager, etc., are all important factors during installation and configuration, because the agent is a part of that. For more information about supported PHP releases, frameworks, and other system requirements, see PHP compatibility and requirements. Install the agent Follow this general process to install the agent on your system. The agent installation package or tar archive includes the interactive newrelic-install script, which automates some installation tasks. Tip If your application is frequently inactive, we recommend you generate some data by interacting with the application or site. This will help ensure the agent initially connects. If you haven't already, create a New Relic account. It's free, forever. Ensure your system meets the agent's requirements, including appropriate system permissions. From your Account settings, copy your license key information. Install the agent package or tar archive on your system. RedHat or CentOS The most common way to install the agent on RedHat or CentOS is with the installation package (.rpm) and the package manager. You can tell the package manager to get it from the New Relic repository, or you can download the .rpm file directly from the New Relic website. Install the package with your preferred package manager (yum or rpm) and then run the newrelic-install script. Ubuntu or Debian Install the package either with apt-get or with dpkg commands. Typically, running the newrelic-install script is not required. Tar archive The .tar archive method is the most generic method you can use on all supported operating systems. Download the compressed tar archive for your system if any of these situations apply to you: Your operating system is not listed here. You are not using a package manager. Other methods are unsuccessful. Install the tar archive of the agent on any supported platform. Change the default application name to a meaningful name. Optional: Change other agent configuration settings to further customize your installation. Restart your web server (Apache, Nginx, PHP-FPM, etc.). Recommendation: To help ensure the PHP agent is initiated, especially if your application has infrequent activity, generate some data by using the app for a few seconds. Wait a few minutes for your application to send data to New Relic. Then, check your app's performance in the New Relic UI. View logs for your APM and infrastructure data You can also bring your logs and application's data together to make troubleshooting easier and faster. With logs in context, you can see log messages related to your errors and traces directly in your app's UI. You can also see logs in context of your infrastructure data, such as Kubernetes clusters. No need to switch to another UI page in New Relic One. Install PHP with partnership accounts Installation procedures may be different for admins who install the PHP agent through a New Relic partnership. For more information, see: AWS Heroku Magento Shared hosting providers Other partnership installation procedures Not all partners support PHP agents.",

      "body": "The infrastructure agent is a lightweight piece of software, designed to minimize its impact on the performance of your hosts. However, the exact load varies depending on your host's workload, particularly on the number of processes running on the host. This is because the agent collects detailed data from each individual process. As a general guideline, New Relic has collected benchmarks for some common types of hosts: Linux single-task host The agent has very low performance overhead on a classic, single-task host. For example, a server running Apache, Unicorn, or a single Java application. Our benchmarks for this type of host are based on an Amazon EC2 t3.2xlarge: vCPUs: 8 vCPUs Memory: 32.0 GB Storage: 160.0 GB Operating system: CentOS 7 For this type of classic, single-task host, typical usage is: CPU: about 0.3% Virtual memory: about 1 GB Resident memory: 25 to 35 MB Storage on disk: about 50 MB Linux Docker host The agent has very low performance overhead on a host running Docker, with exact usage depending on the number of Docker containers your machine hosts, and whether those processes are long- or short-lived. Our benchmarks for this type of host are based on an Amazon EC2 t3.2xlarge: vCPUs: 8 vCPUs Memory: 32.0 GB Storage: 160.0 GB Number of containers: 25 containers, about 100 long-lived processes running in containers Operating system: CentOS 7 For this type of Docker host, typical usage is: CPU: about 0.8% Virtual memory: about 1 GB Resident memory: 25 to 35 MB Storage on disk: about 50 MB Windows host The agent has very low performance overhead on a typical Windows host serving web apps and running the Windows/IIS stack. Our benchmarks for this type of host are based on an Amazon EC2 t2.small: vCPUs: 1 Memory: 2.0 GB Storage: 30.0 GB Operating system: Windows Server 2012 R2 For this type of Windows host, typical usage is: CPU: 2 to 3% Resident Memory: 30 MB Storage on disk: about 50 MB Linux ARM64 host The agent has similar performance overhead on an ARM64 (Graviton 2) host on EC2 when compared with AMD64 machines. The benchmark is based on Amazon EC2 t3.2xlarge vs. t4g.2xlarge instances. Amazon Linux 2 EC2 instance with infrastructure agent default settings: CPU: about 0.1% on ARM vs 0.13% AMD Virtual memory: about 0.75GB ARM vs 1 GB AMD Resident memory: 20MB ARM vs 22 MB AMD We are always improving the performance of the infrastructure agent. If you see unusually high agent performance overhead, get support at support.newrelic.com. Manage data To learn how to adjust how much data our infrastructure monitoring ingests and reports, see Manage infrastructure data. Resource utilization On Linux systems, infrastructure is installed with default settings for each supported service manager. A memory limit of 1 Gigabyte is enforced.

Foreground monitoring The iOS agent only monitors your app while it is in the foreground. The agent does not monitor background services while the app is closed. For more information, see our Mobile data privacy and security documentation. iOS requirements Make sure your iOS app meets these requirements: Component iOS application requirements Operating system iOS 9 or higher For Bitcode support, use SDK version 5.3.0 or higher. API/SDK NSURLConnection and AFNetworking are supported. NSURLSession supports upload and data tags only. ASIHttpRequest networking APIs are deprecated as of iOS agent version 5.8.2. Network traffic for UIWebView and WKWebView is supported. However, WKWebView Transfer size and Http errors are not supported. Languages Objective-C Swift: Works with both network traces and crash reporting, but no interaction traces by default. Interaction traces must be enabled for Swift. Devices Any iOS compatible device: iPhones, iPads, etc. File sizes The agent adds about 2 to 12 megabytes to your iOS release app, depending on platform build. Architectures ARM 64-bit. SHA-2 As a standard security measure for data collection, New Relic requires that your application server supports SHA-2 (256-bit). SHA-1 is not supported. Xcode To take advantage of New Relic's iOS features, make sure you have the latest version of Xcode. arm64e support To be able to properly symbolicate crashes from devices with arm64e architectures, make sure your Xcode settings are enabled for pointer authentication. For more information, see the Apple developer documentation. CocoaPods In order to use the latest XCFramework Agent, use CocoaPods version 1.10.1 or higher. Testing is not supported Our agents are designed and tested to work in a normal app lifecycle. New Relic does not support running any testing environment on applications with the agent. Testing can cause conflicts and unpredictable behavior. Potential method replacement conflicts Our iOS agent utilizes method replacement during run time. This may result in a conflict with other libraries that also implement method replacement, such as ReactiveCocoa, Firebase, Aspects, and AppleGuice.",

This document contains the iOS SDK instrumentation requirements for: Objective C Swift For details about the available methods for custom attributes and events you can send to to New Relic Insights, see the iOS SDK API reference. You can also configure feature flags for: Objective-C Swift Automatically instrumented classes and methods The following methods (for the listed classes and their sub-classes) are already instrumented by New Relic. You do not need to add custom instrumentation to trace them. Classes Methods automatically instrumented by New Relic UIViewController viewDidLoad: viewWillAppear: viewDidAppear: viewWillDisappear: viewDidDisappear: viewWillLayoutSubviews: viewDidLayoutSubviews: UIImage imageNamed: imageWithContentsOfFile: imageWithData: imageWithData:scale: initWithContentsOfFile: initWithData: initWithData:scale: NSJSONSerialization JSONObjectWithData:options:error: JSONObjectWithStream:options:error: dataWithJSONObject:options:error: writeJSONObject:toStream:options:error: NSManagedObjectContext executeFetchRequest:error: processPendingChanges The agent aggregates performance for various methods into summary metrics that appear in the Interactions page. Summary categories include: View loading UI layout Database Images JSON Network Instrument your Objective-C code To have your own Objective-C code appear in interaction code breakdowns and timelines, add a _START call to the beginning of your method and a _STOP call to the end of it. Important Always include a _STOP for each _START, and only include one set of these commands in a given method. The trace system will automatically pick up the class and method name, and report performance metrics for your method to New Relic. - (void)myMethod { NR_TRACE_METHOD_START(0); // … existing code NR_TRACE_METHOD_STOP; } Copy If you are not using ARC, use this version of the _STOP macro to avoid memory leaks: NR_NONARC_TRACE_METHOD_STOP; Copy If you want your method’s performance to be included in the summary data on the APM Overview page, pass one of the NRTraceType enum values into the _START macro; for example: NR_TRACE_METHOD_START(NRTraceTypeDatabase); Copy Create and complete interactions By default, an interaction starts when a view controller is pushed. To manually start an interaction with Objective-C, use these API calls: NSString* uniqueIdentifier = NR_START_NAMED_INTERACTION(@\"name\"); Copy This macro will automatically begin tracking the name interaction trace from the current line. It will also complete any previously running interaction. It returns a unique identifier that can be used to complete that interaction by using this API call: NR_INTERACTION_STOP(uniqueIdentifier); Copy This macro will complete the interaction associated with the uniqueIdentifier if that interaction has not already completed automatically. You do not need to call this method. Rename a default interaction By default, the iOS agent will start an interaction trace when a new view controller is displayed. The interactions are named using the format Display <ViewController>. To change these default names with Objective-C, implement the - (NSString*) customNewRelicInteractionName instance method in your view controller, where the string returned becomes the interaction's name. Set a custom application version The New Relic iOS SDK allows you to set a custom application version string with Objective-C. Instead of using the string defined in CFBundleShortVersionString, call the +[NewRelic setApplicationVersion:] method and pass along the custom application version before calling +[NewRelic startWithApplicationToken:]; [NewRelic setApplicationVersion:(NSString*) appVersion]; Copy Set a custom build identifier As of version 5.1.0 of the New Relic iOS SDK, an API method allows you to set a custom build identifier that is displayed next to the application version in the Crash details page. Instead of using the CFBundleVersion string defined in Xcode with Objective-C, call the +[NewRelic setApplicationBuild:] method, and pass along the custom build identifier. [NewRelic setApplicationBuild:(NSString*) buildNumber]; Copy Create custom metrics Custom metrics can help track high level events specific to your application. With the recordMetric API, you can record arbitrary numerical data and named events with Objective-C and Swift. You can also use several API calls to record custom metrics that provide different levels of detail. Objective-C: Report custom attributes and events Use methods in the NewRelic object to report custom attributes and events. For details about the available methods for custom attributes and events with Objective-C, see the iOS SDK API reference. Methods that return BOOL results return YES if they succeed, or NO if the operation did not complete. These methods are available in versions 5.0.0 or higher of the New Relic iOS SDK. The SDK can store up to 128 user-defined custom attributes at a time. If you attempt to store more than 128 attributes, the SDK returns NO. Custom attributes names should use the simplest format needed, and New Relic recommends single word attributes, containing no spaces. Attribute phrases can be formatted in camel case, so My Custom Attribute is better specified as myCustomAttribute. As with custom metrics: Avoid using the characters / ] [ | * when naming things. Avoid multi-byte characters. Objective-C: Track custom network requests If you can express a transactional network request in terms similar to an HTTP request, you can track it. Use URLs that are well-formed and do not include highly variable paths or hostnames. For requests that complete, use this method: [NewRelic noticeNetworkRequestForURL:(NSURL*)url httpMethod:(NSString*)httpMethod withTimer:(NRTimer *)timer responseHeaders:(NSDictionary *)headers statusCode:(NSInteger)httpStatusCode bytesSent:(NSUInteger)bytesSent bytesReceived:(NSUInteger)bytesReceived responseData:(NSData *)responseData andParams:(NSDictionary *)params]; Copy Parameters include: Parameter Description url The URL of the request httpMethod The method type of the request; for example, POST, GET, etc. timer An NRTimer that timed the network request headers A dictionary containing the HTTP response headers, if available httpStatusCode The response status code If the httpStatusCode is greater than or equal to 400, the agent will record a server error and may capture the responseData body if provided. bytesSent The size of the request body bytesReceived The size of the responseBody responseData The response body data, captured if the agent records server error params params Additional parameters included in an HTTP error metric if the HTTP transaction is an error For requests that fail due to a socket or operating system error, use this method: [NewRelic noticeNetworkFailureForURL:(NSURL *)url httpMethod:(NSString*)httpMethod withTimer:(NRTimer *)timer andFailureCode:(NSInteger)iOSFailureCode]; Copy Parameters include: Parameter Description url The URL of the request httpMethod The method type of the request; for example, POST, GET, etc. timer An NRTimer that timed the network request iOSFailureCode The failure code Failure codes are interpreted as NSURLError* code. To view a complete list of supported codes, see NRConstants.h. Instrument your Swift code To have your own Swift code appear in interaction code breakdowns and timelines: Add a startTracingMethod() call to the beginning of your method. Add a endTracingMethodWithTimer() call to the end of it. Always include an endTracingMethodWithTimer() call for each startTracingMethod() reference. Include only one set of these commands in a given method. func myMethod(){ let timer = NRTimer(); NewRelic.startTracingMethod(#selector(MyClass.myMethod), object: self, timer: timer, category: NRTraceTypeNone) // … existing code NewRelic.endTracingMethodWithTimer(timer) } Copy If you want your method’s performance to be included in the summary data on the APM Overview page, pass one of the NRTraceType enum values into the startTracingMethod() macro; for example: NewRelic.startTracingMethod(#selector(MyClass.myMethod), object: self, timer: timer, category: NRTraceTypeDatabase) Copy Create and complete Swift interactions By default, an interaction starts when a view controller is pushed. To manually start an interaction, use these API calls: let uniqueIdentifier = NewRelic.startInteraction(withName: \"My Interaction\") Copy This call will automatically begin tracking an interaction trace named My Interaction from the current line. It will also complete any previously running interaction. It returns a unique identifier that can be used to complete that interaction by using this API call: NewRelic.stopCurrentInteraction(uniqueIdentifier) Copy This method will complete the interaction associated with the uniqueIdentifier if that interaction has not already completed automatically. You do not need to call this method. Rename a default Swift interaction By default, the iOS agent will start an interaction trace when a new view controller is displayed. The interactions are named using the format Display <ViewController>. To change these default names, implement the @objc func customNewRelicInteractionName() -> String method in your view controller, where the string returned becomes the interaction's name. Set a custom application version with Swift The New Relic iOS SDK allows you to set a custom application version string. Instead of using the string defined in CFBundleShortVersionString, call the NewRelic.setApplicationVersion() method, and pass along the custom application version before calling NewRelic.startWithApplicationToken();. NewRelic.setApplicationVersion(String appVersion) Copy Set a custom build identifier with Swift As of version 5.1.0 of the New Relic iOS SDK, an API method allows you to set a custom build identifier that is displayed next to the application version in the Crash details page.

For a general overview of mobile monitoring functionality, see Introduction to mobile monitoring. Compatibility and requirements Before you install the iOS agent, review the compatibility and requirements. Install the agent As part of the installation process, New Relic automatically generates an application token. This is a 40-character hexadecimal string for authenticating each mobile app that you monitor. There are two ways you can install the iOS agent: We recommend you install and configure the iOS agent using the CocoaPods installation method. You can also manually install and configure the iOS agent by adding the New Relic framework to your app. Extend your instrumentation After you install the agent, you can extend the agent's default instrumentation with various types of custom data: To access: In the mobile UI: In New Relic One dashboards: Custom data Create and record custom events, interaction traces, and attributes to add details to your existing data and traces. You can also query the custom events that you created in New Relic One dashboards and NRQL. Network requests Enable the MobileRequest event feature so you can perform a full network analysis. To further investigate network request error rates and response times, query MobileRequest and MobileRequestError events. Crash analysis Review detailed information using groups and filters to analyze trends that lead to crashes. To view more information about crashes, create NRQL queries to review Insights charts related to crash data. iOS SDK API Use the iOS SDK API to instrument parts of your code that are not instrumented by default. Then, view those custom events and attributes in New Relic Insights. Handled exceptions Report exceptions so you can identify factors creating a poor mobile app experience. To further improve performance, review MobileHandledException event records in New Relic Insights. Breadcrumbs Boost the level of detail in crash event trails by adding breadcrumbs. Then, query MobileBreadcrumbs events to see all breadcrumbs or just breadcrumbs related to crashes. Troubleshoot your installation If the agent isn't reporting data, try these troubleshooting suggestions.",

To change these default names, implement the @objc func customNewRelicInteractionName() -> String method in your view controller, where the string returned becomes the interaction's name. Set a custom application version with Swift The New Relic iOS SDK allows you to set a custom application version string. Instead of using the string defined in CFBundleShortVersionString, call the NewRelic.setApplicationVersion() method, and pass along the custom application version before calling NewRelic.startWithApplicationToken();. NewRelic.setApplicationVersion(String appVersion) Copy Set a custom build identifier with Swift As of version 5.1.0 of the New Relic iOS SDK, an API method allows you to set a custom build identifier that is displayed next to the application version in the Crash details page. Instead of using the CFBundleVersion string defined in Xcode, call the NewRelic.setApplicationBuild() method, and pass along the custom build identifier. NewRelic.setApplicationBuild(buildNumber) Copy Create custom metrics with Swift Custom metrics can help track high level events specific to your application. With the recordMetric API, you can record arbitrary numerical data and named events with Objective-C and Swift. You can also use several API calls to record custom metrics that provide different levels of detail. Swift: Report custom attributes and events Use methods in the NewRelic object to report custom attributes and events. For details about the available methods for custom attributes and events with Swift, see the iOS SDK API reference. Methods that return BOOL results return YES if they succeed, or NO if the operation did not complete. These methods are available in versions 5.0.0 or higher of the New Relic iOS SDK. The SDK can store up to 128 user-defined custom attributes at a time. If you attempt to store more than 128 attributes, the SDK returns NO. Custom attributes names should use the simplest format needed, and New Relic recommends single word attributes, containing no spaces. Attribute phrases can be formatted in camel case, so My Custom Attribute is better specified as myCustomAttribute. As with custom metrics: Avoid using the characters / ] [ | * when naming things. Avoid multi-byte characters. Swift: Track custom network requests If you can express a transactional network request in terms similar to an HTTP request, you can track it. Use URLs that are well-formed and do not include highly variable paths or hostnames. For requests that complete, use this method: NewRelic.noticeNetworkRequestForURL(url: NSURL!, httpMethod: String!, withTimer: NRTimer!, responseHeaders:[NSObject : AnyObject]!, statusCode: Int, bytesSent: UInt, bytesReceived: UInt, responseData: NSData!, andParams: [NSObject : AnyObject]!) Copy Parameters include: Parameter Description url The URL of the request httpMethod The method type of the request; for example, POST, GET, etc. timer An NRTimer that timed the network request headers A dictionary containing the HTTP response headers, if available httpStatusCode The response status code If the httpStatusCode is greater than or equal to 400, the agent will record a server error and may capture the responseData body if provided. bytesSent The size of the request body bytesReceived The size of the responseBody responseData The response body data, captured if the agent records Server error params params Additional parameters included in an HTTP error metric if the HTTP transaction is an error For requests that fail due to a socket or operating system error, use this method: NewRelic.noticeNetworkFailureForURL(url: NSURL!, httpMethod: NSString!, withTimer: NRTimer!, andFailureCode: Int) Copy Parameters include: Parameter Description url The URL of the request httpMethod The method type of the request; for example, POST, GET, etc. timer An NRTimer that timed the network request iOSFailureCode The failure code Failure codes are interpreted as NSURLError* code.

You can also query the custom events that you created in New Relic One dashboards and NRQL. Network requests Enable the MobileRequest event feature so you can perform a full network analysis. To further investigate network request error rates and response times, query MobileRequest and MobileRequestError events. Crash analysis Review detailed information using groups and filters to analyze trends that lead to crashes. To view more information about crashes, create NRQL queries to review Insights charts related to crash data. iOS SDK API Use the iOS SDK API to instrument parts of your code that are not instrumented by default. Then, view those custom events and attributes in New Relic Insights. Handled exceptions Report exceptions so you can identify factors creating a poor mobile app experience. To further improve performance, review MobileHandledException event records in New Relic Insights. Breadcrumbs Boost the level of detail in crash event trails by adding breadcrumbs. Then, query MobileBreadcrumbs events to see all breadcrumbs or just breadcrumbs related to crashes.

This document contains the iOS SDK instrumentation requirements for: Objective C Swift For details about the available methods for custom attributes and events you can send to to New Relic Insights, see the iOS SDK API reference. You can also configure feature flags for: Objective-C Swift Automatically instrumented classes and methods The following methods (for the listed classes and their sub-classes) are already instrumented by New Relic.

Summary categories include: View loading UI layout Database Images JSON Network Instrument your Objective-C code To have your own Objective-C code appear in interaction code breakdowns and timelines, add a _START call to the beginning of your method and a _STOP call to the end of it. Important Always include a _STOP for each _START, and only include one set of these commands in a given method. The trace system will automatically pick up the class and method name, and report performance metrics for your method to New Relic. - (void)myMethod { NR_TRACE_METHOD_START(0); // … existing code NR_TRACE_METHOD_STOP; } Copy If you are not using ARC, use this version of the _STOP macro to avoid memory leaks: NR_NONARC_TRACE_METHOD_STOP; Copy If you want your method’s performance to be included in the summary data on the APM Overview page, pass one of the NRTraceType enum values into the _START macro; for example: NR_TRACE_METHOD_START(NRTraceTypeDatabase); Copy Create and complete interactions By default, an interaction starts when a view controller is pushed. To manually start an interaction with Objective-C, use these API calls: NSString* uniqueIdentifier = NR_START_NAMED_INTERACTION(@\"name\"); Copy This macro will automatically begin tracking the name interaction trace from the current line. It will also complete any previously running interaction. It returns a unique identifier that can be used to complete that interaction by using this API call: NR_INTERACTION_STOP(uniqueIdentifier); Copy This macro will complete the interaction associated with the uniqueIdentifier if that interaction has not already completed automatically. You do not need to call this method. Rename a default interaction By default, the iOS agent will start an interaction trace when a new view controller is displayed. The interactions are named using the format Display <ViewController>. To change these default names with Objective-C, implement the - (NSString*) customNewRelicInteractionName instance method in your view controller, where the string returned becomes the interaction's name. Set a custom application version The New Relic iOS SDK allows you to set a custom application version string with Objective-C. Instead of using the string defined in CFBundleShortVersionString, call the +[NewRelic setApplicationVersion:] method and pass along the custom application version before calling +[NewRelic startWithApplicationToken:]; [NewRelic setApplicationVersion:(NSString*) appVersion]; Copy Set a custom build identifier As of version 5.1.0 of the New Relic iOS SDK, an API method allows you to set a custom build identifier that is displayed next to the application version in the Crash details page.

Methods that return BOOL results return YES if they succeed, or NO if the operation did not complete. These methods are available in versions 5.0.0 or higher of the New Relic iOS SDK. The SDK can store up to 128 user-defined custom attributes at a time. If you attempt to store more than 128 attributes, the SDK returns NO. Custom attributes names should use the simplest format needed, and New Relic recommends single word attributes, containing no spaces. Attribute phrases can be formatted in camel case, so My Custom Attribute is better specified as myCustomAttribute. As with custom metrics: Avoid using the characters / ] [ | * when naming things. Avoid multi-byte characters. Objective-C: Track custom network requests If you can express a transactional network request in terms similar to an HTTP request, you can track it. Use URLs that are well-formed and do not include highly variable paths or hostnames. For requests that complete, use this method: [NewRelic noticeNetworkRequestForURL:(NSURL*)url httpMethod:(NSString*)httpMethod withTimer:(NRTimer *)timer responseHeaders:(NSDictionary *)headers statusCode:(NSInteger)httpStatusCode bytesSent:(NSUInteger)bytesSent bytesReceived:(NSUInteger)bytesReceived responseData:(NSData *)responseData andParams:(NSDictionary *)params]; Copy Parameters include: Parameter Description url The URL of the request httpMethod The method type of the request; for example, POST, GET, etc. timer An NRTimer that timed the network request headers A dictionary containing the HTTP response headers, if available httpStatusCode The response status code If the httpStatusCode is greater than or equal to 400, the agent will record a server error and may capture the responseData body if provided. bytesSent The size of the request body bytesReceived The size of the responseBody responseData The response body data, captured if the agent records server error params params Additional parameters included in an HTTP error metric if the HTTP transaction is an error For requests that fail due to a socket or operating system error, use this method: [NewRelic noticeNetworkFailureForURL:(NSURL *)url httpMethod:(NSString*)httpMethod withTimer:(NRTimer *)timer andFailureCode:(NSInteger)iOSFailureCode]; Copy Parameters include: Parameter Description url The URL of the request httpMethod The method type of the request; for example, POST, GET, etc. timer An NRTimer that timed the network request iOSFailureCode The failure code Failure codes are interpreted as NSURLError* code. To view a complete list of supported codes, see NRConstants.h. Instrument your Swift code To have your own Swift code appear in interaction code breakdowns and timelines: Add a startTracingMethod() call to the beginning of your method. Add a endTracingMethodWithTimer() call to the end of it. Always include an endTracingMethodWithTimer() call for each startTracingMethod() reference. Include only one set of these commands in a given method. func myMethod(){ let timer = NRTimer(); NewRelic.startTracingMethod(#selector(MyClass.myMethod), object: self, timer: timer, category: NRTraceTypeNone) // … existing code NewRelic.endTracingMethodWithTimer(timer) } Copy If you want your method’s performance to be included in the summary data on the APM Overview page, pass one of the NRTraceType enum values into the startTracingMethod() macro; for example: NewRelic.startTracingMethod(#selector(MyClass.myMethod), object: self, timer: timer, category: NRTraceTypeDatabase) Copy Create and complete Swift interactions By default, an interaction starts when a view controller is pushed. To manually start an interaction, use these API calls: let uniqueIdentifier = NewRelic.startInteraction(withName: \"My Interaction\") Copy This call will automatically begin tracking an interaction trace named My Interaction from the current line. It will also complete any previously running interaction. It returns a unique identifier that can be used to complete that interaction by using this API call: NewRelic.stopCurrentInteraction(uniqueIdentifier) Copy This method will complete the interaction associated with the uniqueIdentifier if that interaction has not already completed automatically.

Crash analysis Review detailed information using groups and filters to analyze trends that lead to crashes. To view more information about crashes, create NRQL queries to review Insights charts related to crash data. iOS SDK API Use the iOS SDK API to instrument parts of your code that are not instrumented by default. Then, view those custom events and attributes in New Relic Insights. Handled exceptions Report exceptions so you can identify factors creating a poor mobile app experience. To further improve performance, review MobileHandledException event records in New Relic Insights. Breadcrumbs Boost the level of detail in crash event trails by adding breadcrumbs. Then, query MobileBreadcrumbs events to see all breadcrumbs or just breadcrumbs related to crashes.

Languages Objective-C Swift: Works with both network traces and crash reporting, but no interaction traces by default. Interaction traces must be enabled for Swift. Devices Any iOS compatible device: iPhones, iPads, etc. File sizes The agent adds about 2 to 12 megabytes to your iOS release app, depending on platform build. Architectures ARM 64-bit. SHA-2 As a standard security measure for data collection, New Relic requires that your application server supports SHA-2 (256-bit). SHA-1 is not supported. Xcode To take advantage of New Relic's iOS features, make sure you have the latest version of Xcode. arm64e support To be able to properly symbolicate crashes from devices with arm64e architectures, make sure your Xcode settings are enabled for pointer authentication. For more information, see the Apple developer documentation. CocoaPods In order to use the latest XCFramework Agent, use CocoaPods version 1.10.1 or higher. Testing is not supported Our agents are designed and tested to work in a normal app lifecycle. New Relic does not support running any testing environment on applications with the agent. Testing can cause conflicts and unpredictable behavior. Potential method replacement conflicts Our iOS agent utilizes method replacement during run time.

      "body": "Your app's dSYM files are stored in Xcode's dSYM archive path folder. This is the folder where the iOS agent gets the dSYM files that are used to symbolicate your crash reports. New Relic provides a post-build script as part of the iOS agent's install process and the tvOS agent's install process. This script automatically uploads your app's dSYM files. Automatic script The script automatically uploads dSYM files only for release builds. Non-release builds must upload their files either manually or through the mobile monitoring UI. Bitcode-enabled apps have their dSYM files generated by Apple. You must download the dSYM files for Bitcode-enabled apps from Apple and upload them to New Relic. If you see unreadable machine code in the Crashes page, your dSYM files may not be uploaded correctly. In some cases, you may need to manually upload dSYM files. The automatic script uses Python 2. As of October 2019 with macOS 10.15 (Catalina), Python won't be installed by default. If you're using the automatic script (recommended), you may need to manually install Python 2. If you're using Homebrew, see Python on Homebrew. Identify missing dSYMs When a Bitcode-enabled app is uploaded to Apple for App Store review or ad-hoc distribution, dSYMs need to be manually downloaded from Apple and uploaded to New Relic to allow the mobile crash reports to be properly symbolicated. These dSYMs can be downloaded through the archives organizer in Xcode within several minutes of uploading the app. In this situation follow the procedures to find the archive and download dSYMs. If an app is missing a dSYM file, you'll see three indicators in the mobile monitoring UI: Banner notification: A banner warning appears on the Crash report page. The warning reads: We were unable to locate your dsym. Copy Upload prompt: From the Crash type summary page you will be automatically prompted to upload a dSYM file if it is missing. Machine code: The crash stack trace on the Crash report page displays machine code and not a human-readable error message. Upload dSYM files through the mobile monitoring UI You can easily upload your dSYM files directly from the New Relic One UI. The maximum file size is 600 MB. To upload your dSYM files: Go to one.newrelic.com and click Mobile. Then select your app from the list. View Crash analysis. Select a specific crash from the Crash types list. Click Upload dSYM. You can either drag and drop your dSYMs directly, or select the file form your computer. Manually upload dSYM files In some circumstances, New Relic's automatic upload of dSYM files may fail. If a dSYM upload is attempted and fails, it creates a build error with a detailed message. For example, if there's a network failure and the dSYM upload isn't completed, Xcode will report an error. For additional information about how New Relic handles dSYM uploads, see New Relic's Online Technical Community. If the automatic upload fails, you can manually upload your dSYM file. If you have multiple dSYM files, they can be within a single zip with a maximum file size of 600 MB. The YOUR_NEW_RELIC_APPLICATION_TOKEN value in the commands below is the same key used for +[NewRelic startWithApplicationToken:] (in Objective-C) or NewRelic.start(withApplicationToken:) (in Swift). To manually upload your dSYM files: Via Python script (agent versions 6.0.0 or higher) In iOS agent versions 6.0.0 or higher, the agent includes a Python script that automatically processes and uploads symbols. You can call this script from the command line: NewRelicAgent.framework/Resources/generateMap.py \"DSYM_ARCHIVE_PATH\" \"YOUR_NEW_RELIC_APPLICATION_TOKEN\" Copy Via command line To manually upload individual dSYM files from the command line: Zip up your dSYM file or files using the following command. Replace ~ /ZIPPED_DSYM_PATH with your new dSYM archive path and file name (for example, Users/my-name/desktop). Also replace ~ /dSYM_PATH with your existing dSYM file path. /usr/bin/zip --recurse-paths --quiet \"~/ZIPPED_DSYM_PATH\" \"~/dSYM_PATH\" Copy Upload the dSYM zip file using the following command: For US accounts: curl -F dsym=@\"~/DSYM_ZIP_PATH\" -H \"X-APP-LICENSE-KEY: YOUR_NEW_RELIC_APPLICATION_TOKEN\" https://mobile-symbol-upload.newrelic.com/symbol Copy For EU accounts: curl -F dsym=@\"~/DSYM_ZIP_PATH\" -H \"X-APP-LICENSE-KEY: YOUR_NEW_RELIC_APPLICATION_TOKEN\" https://mobile-symbol-upload.eu01.nr-data.net/symbol Copy Troubleshooting Auto-upload failure If a dSYM auto-upload failed, the Report Navigator may have a fully formed cURL command. You can use this cURL command to reattempt an upload. Depending on the error, you may also need to follow some of the dSYM manual upload steps. Here is an example of a successful dSYM upload in the Report Navigator: Example: A successful dSYM upload in the Report Navigator. Missing dSYMs If dSYM files are missing, you may need to check Xcode build settings to ensure the file is being generated. Frameworks which are built locally have separate build settings and may need to be updated as well.

Send custom attributes and events to Insights. Track networking from libraries not supported automatically. Set a custom identifier value with Objective-C or Swift to associate user sessions with analysis events and attributes (iOS SDK version 5.9.0 or higher). Caution Tracing is heavily optimized, but it does impose a performance overhead. Avoid instrumenting methods that are expected to be called hundreds of times. Install the SDK Ensure you have your app instrumented with the latest iOS SDK by going to one.newrelic.com > Add more data and following the instructions for iOS. This document contains the iOS SDK instrumentation requirements for: Objective C Swift For details about the available methods for custom attributes and events you can send to to New Relic Insights, see the iOS SDK API reference. You can also configure feature flags for: Objective-C Swift Automatically instrumented classes and methods The following methods (for the listed classes and their sub-classes) are already instrumented by New Relic. You do not need to add custom instrumentation to trace them. Classes Methods automatically instrumented by New Relic UIViewController viewDidLoad: viewWillAppear: viewDidAppear: viewWillDisappear: viewDidDisappear: viewWillLayoutSubviews: viewDidLayoutSubviews: UIImage imageNamed: imageWithContentsOfFile: imageWithData: imageWithData:scale: initWithContentsOfFile: initWithData: initWithData:scale: NSJSONSerialization JSONObjectWithData:options:error: JSONObjectWithStream:options:error: dataWithJSONObject:options:error: writeJSONObject:toStream:options:error: NSManagedObjectContext executeFetchRequest:error: processPendingChanges The agent aggregates performance for various methods into summary metrics that appear in the Interactions page. Summary categories include: View loading UI layout Database Images JSON Network Instrument your Objective-C code To have your own Objective-C code appear in interaction code breakdowns and timelines, add a _START call to the beginning of your method and a _STOP call to the end of it. Important Always include a _STOP for each _START, and only include one set of these commands in a given method. The trace system will automatically pick up the class and method name, and report performance metrics for your method to New Relic. - (void)myMethod { NR_TRACE_METHOD_START(0); // … existing code NR_TRACE_METHOD_STOP; } Copy If you are not using ARC, use this version of the _STOP macro to avoid memory leaks: NR_NONARC_TRACE_METHOD_STOP; Copy If you want your method’s performance to be included in the summary data on the APM Overview page, pass one of the NRTraceType enum values into the _START macro; for example: NR_TRACE_METHOD_START(NRTraceTypeDatabase); Copy Create and complete interactions By default, an interaction starts when a view controller is pushed. To manually start an interaction with Objective-C, use these API calls: NSString* uniqueIdentifier = NR_START_NAMED_INTERACTION(@\"name\"); Copy This macro will automatically begin tracking the name interaction trace from the current line. It will also complete any previously running interaction. It returns a unique identifier that can be used to complete that interaction by using this API call: NR_INTERACTION_STOP(uniqueIdentifier); Copy This macro will complete the interaction associated with the uniqueIdentifier if that interaction has not already completed automatically. You do not need to call this method. Rename a default interaction By default, the iOS agent will start an interaction trace when a new view controller is displayed. The interactions are named using the format Display <ViewController>. To change these default names with Objective-C, implement the - (NSString*) customNewRelicInteractionName instance method in your view controller, where the string returned becomes the interaction's name. Set a custom application version The New Relic iOS SDK allows you to set a custom application version string with Objective-C. Instead of using the string defined in CFBundleShortVersionString, call the +[NewRelic setApplicationVersion:] method and pass along the custom application version before calling +[NewRelic startWithApplicationToken:]; [NewRelic setApplicationVersion:(NSString*) appVersion]; Copy Set a custom build identifier As of version 5.1.0 of the New Relic iOS SDK, an API method allows you to set a custom build identifier that is displayed next to the application version in the Crash details page. Instead of using the CFBundleVersion string defined in Xcode with Objective-C, call the +[NewRelic setApplicationBuild:] method, and pass along the custom build identifier. [NewRelic setApplicationBuild:(NSString*) buildNumber]; Copy Create custom metrics Custom metrics can help track high level events specific to your application. With the recordMetric API, you can record arbitrary numerical data and named events with Objective-C and Swift. You can also use several API calls to record custom metrics that provide different levels of detail. Objective-C: Report custom attributes and events Use methods in the NewRelic object to report custom attributes and events. For details about the available methods for custom attributes and events with Objective-C, see the iOS SDK API reference. Methods that return BOOL results return YES if they succeed, or NO if the operation did not complete. These methods are available in versions 5.0.0 or higher of the New Relic iOS SDK. The SDK can store up to 128 user-defined custom attributes at a time. If you attempt to store more than 128 attributes, the SDK returns NO. Custom attributes names should use the simplest format needed, and New Relic recommends single word attributes, containing no spaces. Attribute phrases can be formatted in camel case, so My Custom Attribute is better specified as myCustomAttribute. As with custom metrics: Avoid using the characters / ] [ | * when naming things. Avoid multi-byte characters. Objective-C: Track custom network requests If you can express a transactional network request in terms similar to an HTTP request, you can track it. Use URLs that are well-formed and do not include highly variable paths or hostnames. For requests that complete, use this method: [NewRelic noticeNetworkRequestForURL:(NSURL*)url httpMethod:(NSString*)httpMethod withTimer:(NRTimer *)timer responseHeaders:(NSDictionary *)headers statusCode:(NSInteger)httpStatusCode bytesSent:(NSUInteger)bytesSent bytesReceived:(NSUInteger)bytesReceived responseData:(NSData *)responseData andParams:(NSDictionary *)params]; Copy Parameters include: Parameter Description url The URL of the request httpMethod The method type of the request; for example, POST, GET, etc. timer An NRTimer that timed the network request headers A dictionary containing the HTTP response headers, if available httpStatusCode The response status code If the httpStatusCode is greater than or equal to 400, the agent will record a server error and may capture the responseData body if provided. bytesSent The size of the request body bytesReceived The size of the responseBody responseData The response body data, captured if the agent records server error params params Additional parameters included in an HTTP error metric if the HTTP transaction is an error For requests that fail due to a socket or operating system error, use this method: [NewRelic noticeNetworkFailureForURL:(NSURL *)url httpMethod:(NSString*)httpMethod withTimer:(NRTimer *)timer andFailureCode:(NSInteger)iOSFailureCode]; Copy Parameters include: Parameter Description url The URL of the request httpMethod The method type of the request; for example, POST, GET, etc. timer An NRTimer that timed the network request iOSFailureCode The failure code Failure codes are interpreted as NSURLError* code. To view a complete list of supported codes, see NRConstants.h. Instrument your Swift code To have your own Swift code appear in interaction code breakdowns and timelines: Add a startTracingMethod() call to the beginning of your method. Add a endTracingMethodWithTimer() call to the end of it. Always include an endTracingMethodWithTimer() call for each startTracingMethod() reference. Include only one set of these commands in a given method. func myMethod(){ let timer = NRTimer(); NewRelic.startTracingMethod(#selector(MyClass.myMethod), object: self, timer: timer, category: NRTraceTypeNone) // … existing code NewRelic.endTracingMethodWithTimer(timer) } Copy If you want your method’s performance to be included in the summary data on the APM Overview page, pass one of the NRTraceType enum values into the startTracingMethod() macro; for example: NewRelic.startTracingMethod(#selector(MyClass.myMethod), object: self, timer: timer, category: NRTraceTypeDatabase) Copy Create and complete Swift interactions By default, an interaction starts when a view controller is pushed. To manually start an interaction, use these API calls: let uniqueIdentifier = NewRelic.startInteraction(withName: \"My Interaction\") Copy This call will automatically begin tracking an interaction trace named My Interaction from the current line. It will also complete any previously running interaction. It returns a unique identifier that can be used to complete that interaction by using this API call: NewRelic.stopCurrentInteraction(uniqueIdentifier) Copy This method will complete the interaction associated with the uniqueIdentifier if that interaction has not already completed automatically. You do not need to call this method. Rename a default Swift interaction By default, the iOS agent will start an interaction trace when a new view controller is displayed. The interactions are named using the format Display <ViewController>. To change these default names, implement the @objc func customNewRelicInteractionName() -> String method in your view controller, where the string returned becomes the interaction's name. Set a custom application version with Swift The New Relic iOS SDK allows you to set a custom application version string. Instead of using the string defined in CFBundleShortVersionString, call the NewRelic.setApplicationVersion() method, and pass along the custom application version before calling NewRelic.startWithApplicationToken();. NewRelic.setApplicationVersion(String appVersion) Copy Set a custom build identifier with Swift As of version 5.1.0 of the New Relic iOS SDK, an API method allows you to set a custom build identifier that is displayed next to the application version in the Crash details page.

      "body": "New Relic's mobile monitoring for iOS gives you a comprehensive view of your app's performance. It works for iOS apps written using Objective-C, Swift, or both languages. For a general overview of mobile monitoring functionality, see Introduction to mobile monitoring. Compatibility and requirements Before you install the iOS agent, review the compatibility and requirements. Install the agent As part of the installation process, New Relic automatically generates an application token. This is a 40-character hexadecimal string for authenticating each mobile app that you monitor. There are two ways you can install the iOS agent: We recommend you install and configure the iOS agent using the CocoaPods installation method. You can also manually install and configure the iOS agent by adding the New Relic framework to your app. Extend your instrumentation After you install the agent, you can extend the agent's default instrumentation with various types of custom data: To access: In the mobile UI: In New Relic One dashboards: Custom data Create and record custom events, interaction traces, and attributes to add details to your existing data and traces. You can also query the custom events that you created in New Relic One dashboards and NRQL. Network requests Enable the MobileRequest event feature so you can perform a full network analysis. To further investigate network request error rates and response times, query MobileRequest and MobileRequestError events. Crash analysis Review detailed information using groups and filters to analyze trends that lead to crashes. To view more information about crashes, create NRQL queries to review Insights charts related to crash data. iOS SDK API Use the iOS SDK API to instrument parts of your code that are not instrumented by default.

      "body": "Use the iOS SDK API to add custom data. For example: Instrument your own code. Start and stop interaction traces from events in your mobile app. Record custom metrics. Send custom attributes and events to Insights. Track networking from libraries not supported automatically. Set a custom identifier value with Objective-C or Swift to associate user sessions with analysis events and attributes (iOS SDK version 5.9.0 or higher). Caution Tracing is heavily optimized, but it does impose a performance overhead. Avoid instrumenting methods that are expected to be called hundreds of times. Install the SDK Ensure you have your app instrumented with the latest iOS SDK by going to one.newrelic.com > Add more data and following the instructions for iOS. This document contains the iOS SDK instrumentation requirements for: Objective C Swift For details about the available methods for custom attributes and events you can send to to New Relic Insights, see the iOS SDK API reference. You can also configure feature flags for: Objective-C Swift Automatically instrumented classes and methods The following methods (for the listed classes and their sub-classes) are already instrumented by New Relic. You do not need to add custom instrumentation to trace them. Classes Methods automatically instrumented by New Relic UIViewController viewDidLoad: viewWillAppear: viewDidAppear: viewWillDisappear: viewDidDisappear: viewWillLayoutSubviews: viewDidLayoutSubviews: UIImage imageNamed: imageWithContentsOfFile: imageWithData: imageWithData:scale: initWithContentsOfFile: initWithData: initWithData:scale: NSJSONSerialization JSONObjectWithData:options:error: JSONObjectWithStream:options:error: dataWithJSONObject:options:error: writeJSONObject:toStream:options:error: NSManagedObjectContext executeFetchRequest:error: processPendingChanges The agent aggregates performance for various methods into summary metrics that appear in the Interactions page. Summary categories include: View loading UI layout Database Images JSON Network Instrument your Objective-C code To have your own Objective-C code appear in interaction code breakdowns and timelines, add a _START call to the beginning of your method and a _STOP call to the end of it. Important Always include a _STOP for each _START, and only include one set of these commands in a given method. The trace system will automatically pick up the class and method name, and report performance metrics for your method to New Relic. - (void)myMethod { NR_TRACE_METHOD_START(0); // … existing code NR_TRACE_METHOD_STOP; } Copy If you are not using ARC, use this version of the _STOP macro to avoid memory leaks: NR_NONARC_TRACE_METHOD_STOP; Copy If you want your method’s performance to be included in the summary data on the APM Overview page, pass one of the NRTraceType enum values into the _START macro; for example: NR_TRACE_METHOD_START(NRTraceTypeDatabase); Copy Create and complete interactions By default, an interaction starts when a view controller is pushed. To manually start an interaction with Objective-C, use these API calls: NSString* uniqueIdentifier = NR_START_NAMED_INTERACTION(@\"name\"); Copy This macro will automatically begin tracking the name interaction trace from the current line. It will also complete any previously running interaction. It returns a unique identifier that can be used to complete that interaction by using this API call: NR_INTERACTION_STOP(uniqueIdentifier); Copy This macro will complete the interaction associated with the uniqueIdentifier if that interaction has not already completed automatically. You do not need to call this method. Rename a default interaction By default, the iOS agent will start an interaction trace when a new view controller is displayed. The interactions are named using the format Display <ViewController>. To change these default names with Objective-C, implement the - (NSString*) customNewRelicInteractionName instance method in your view controller, where the string returned becomes the interaction's name. Set a custom application version The New Relic iOS SDK allows you to set a custom application version string with Objective-C. Instead of using the string defined in CFBundleShortVersionString, call the +[NewRelic setApplicationVersion:] method and pass along the custom application version before calling +[NewRelic startWithApplicationToken:]; [NewRelic setApplicationVersion:(NSString*) appVersion]; Copy Set a custom build identifier As of version 5.1.0 of the New Relic iOS SDK, an API method allows you to set a custom build identifier that is displayed next to the application version in the Crash details page. Instead of using the CFBundleVersion string defined in Xcode with Objective-C, call the +[NewRelic setApplicationBuild:] method, and pass along the custom build identifier. [NewRelic setApplicationBuild:(NSString*) buildNumber]; Copy Create custom metrics Custom metrics can help track high level events specific to your application. With the recordMetric API, you can record arbitrary numerical data and named events with Objective-C and Swift. You can also use several API calls to record custom metrics that provide different levels of detail. Objective-C: Report custom attributes and events Use methods in the NewRelic object to report custom attributes and events. For details about the available methods for custom attributes and events with Objective-C, see the iOS SDK API reference. Methods that return BOOL results return YES if they succeed, or NO if the operation did not complete. These methods are available in versions 5.0.0 or higher of the New Relic iOS SDK. The SDK can store up to 128 user-defined custom attributes at a time. If you attempt to store more than 128 attributes, the SDK returns NO. Custom attributes names should use the simplest format needed, and New Relic recommends single word attributes, containing no spaces. Attribute phrases can be formatted in camel case, so My Custom Attribute is better specified as myCustomAttribute. As with custom metrics: Avoid using the characters / ] [ | * when naming things. Avoid multi-byte characters. Objective-C: Track custom network requests If you can express a transactional network request in terms similar to an HTTP request, you can track it. Use URLs that are well-formed and do not include highly variable paths or hostnames. For requests that complete, use this method: [NewRelic noticeNetworkRequestForURL:(NSURL*)url httpMethod:(NSString*)httpMethod withTimer:(NRTimer *)timer responseHeaders:(NSDictionary *)headers statusCode:(NSInteger)httpStatusCode bytesSent:(NSUInteger)bytesSent bytesReceived:(NSUInteger)bytesReceived responseData:(NSData *)responseData andParams:(NSDictionary *)params]; Copy Parameters include: Parameter Description url The URL of the request httpMethod The method type of the request; for example, POST, GET, etc. timer An NRTimer that timed the network request headers A dictionary containing the HTTP response headers, if available httpStatusCode The response status code If the httpStatusCode is greater than or equal to 400, the agent will record a server error and may capture the responseData body if provided. bytesSent The size of the request body bytesReceived The size of the responseBody responseData The response body data, captured if the agent records server error params params Additional parameters included in an HTTP error metric if the HTTP transaction is an error For requests that fail due to a socket or operating system error, use this method: [NewRelic noticeNetworkFailureForURL:(NSURL *)url httpMethod:(NSString*)httpMethod withTimer:(NRTimer *)timer andFailureCode:(NSInteger)iOSFailureCode]; Copy Parameters include: Parameter Description url The URL of the request httpMethod The method type of the request; for example, POST, GET, etc. timer An NRTimer that timed the network request iOSFailureCode The failure code Failure codes are interpreted as NSURLError* code. To view a complete list of supported codes, see NRConstants.h. Instrument your Swift code To have your own Swift code appear in interaction code breakdowns and timelines: Add a startTracingMethod() call to the beginning of your method. Add a endTracingMethodWithTimer() call to the end of it. Always include an endTracingMethodWithTimer() call for each startTracingMethod() reference. Include only one set of these commands in a given method. func myMethod(){ let timer = NRTimer(); NewRelic.startTracingMethod(#selector(MyClass.myMethod), object: self, timer: timer, category: NRTraceTypeNone) // … existing code NewRelic.endTracingMethodWithTimer(timer) } Copy If you want your method’s performance to be included in the summary data on the APM Overview page, pass one of the NRTraceType enum values into the startTracingMethod() macro; for example: NewRelic.startTracingMethod(#selector(MyClass.myMethod), object: self, timer: timer, category: NRTraceTypeDatabase) Copy Create and complete Swift interactions By default, an interaction starts when a view controller is pushed. To manually start an interaction, use these API calls: let uniqueIdentifier = NewRelic.startInteraction(withName: \"My Interaction\") Copy This call will automatically begin tracking an interaction trace named My Interaction from the current line. It will also complete any previously running interaction. It returns a unique identifier that can be used to complete that interaction by using this API call: NewRelic.stopCurrentInteraction(uniqueIdentifier) Copy This method will complete the interaction associated with the uniqueIdentifier if that interaction has not already completed automatically. You do not need to call this method. Rename a default Swift interaction By default, the iOS agent will start an interaction trace when a new view controller is displayed. The interactions are named using the format Display <ViewController>. To change these default names, implement the @objc func customNewRelicInteractionName() -> String method in your view controller, where the string returned becomes the interaction's name. Set a custom application version with Swift The New Relic iOS SDK allows you to set a custom application version string. Instead of using the string defined in CFBundleShortVersionString, call the NewRelic.setApplicationVersion() method, and pass along the custom application version before calling NewRelic.startWithApplicationToken();. NewRelic.setApplicationVersion(String appVersion) Copy Set a custom build identifier with Swift As of version 5.1.0 of the New Relic iOS SDK, an API method allows you to set a custom build identifier that is displayed next to the application version in the Crash details page. Instead of using the CFBundleVersion string defined in Xcode, call the NewRelic.setApplicationBuild() method, and pass along the custom build identifier.

For a general overview of mobile monitoring functionality, see Introduction to mobile monitoring. Compatibility and requirements Before you install the iOS agent, review the compatibility and requirements. Install the agent As part of the installation process, New Relic automatically generates an application token. This is a 40-character hexadecimal string for authenticating each mobile app that you monitor. There are two ways you can install the iOS agent: We recommend you install and configure the iOS agent using the CocoaPods installation method. You can also manually install and configure the iOS agent by adding the New Relic framework to your app. Extend your instrumentation After you install the agent, you can extend the agent's default instrumentation with various types of custom data: To access: In the mobile UI: In New Relic One dashboards: Custom data Create and record custom events, interaction traces, and attributes to add details to your existing data and traces. You can also query the custom events that you created in New Relic One dashboards and NRQL. Network requests Enable the MobileRequest event feature so you can perform a full network analysis. To further investigate network request error rates and response times, query MobileRequest and MobileRequestError events. Crash analysis Review detailed information using groups and filters to analyze trends that lead to crashes. To view more information about crashes, create NRQL queries to review Insights charts related to crash data. iOS SDK API Use the iOS SDK API to instrument parts of your code that are not instrumented by default.

Send custom attributes and events to Insights. Track networking from libraries not supported automatically. Set a custom identifier value with Objective-C or Swift to associate user sessions with analysis events and attributes (iOS SDK version 5.9.0 or higher). Caution Tracing is heavily optimized, but it does impose a performance overhead. Avoid instrumenting methods that are expected to be called hundreds of times. Install the SDK Ensure you have your app instrumented with the latest iOS SDK by going to one.newrelic.com > Add more data and following the instructions for iOS. This document contains the iOS SDK instrumentation requirements for: Objective C Swift For details about the available methods for custom attributes and events you can send to to New Relic Insights, see the iOS SDK API reference. You can also configure feature flags for: Objective-C Swift Automatically instrumented classes and methods The following methods (for the listed classes and their sub-classes) are already instrumented by New Relic. You do not need to add custom instrumentation to trace them.

Summary categories include: View loading UI layout Database Images JSON Network Instrument your Objective-C code To have your own Objective-C code appear in interaction code breakdowns and timelines, add a _START call to the beginning of your method and a _STOP call to the end of it. Important Always include a _STOP for each _START, and only include one set of these commands in a given method. The trace system will automatically pick up the class and method name, and report performance metrics for your method to New Relic. - (void)myMethod { NR_TRACE_METHOD_START(0); // … existing code NR_TRACE_METHOD_STOP; } Copy If you are not using ARC, use this version of the _STOP macro to avoid memory leaks: NR_NONARC_TRACE_METHOD_STOP; Copy If you want your method’s performance to be included in the summary data on the APM Overview page, pass one of the NRTraceType enum values into the _START macro; for example: NR_TRACE_METHOD_START(NRTraceTypeDatabase); Copy Create and complete interactions By default, an interaction starts when a view controller is pushed. To manually start an interaction with Objective-C, use these API calls: NSString* uniqueIdentifier = NR_START_NAMED_INTERACTION(@\"name\"); Copy This macro will automatically begin tracking the name interaction trace from the current line. It will also complete any previously running interaction. It returns a unique identifier that can be used to complete that interaction by using this API call: NR_INTERACTION_STOP(uniqueIdentifier); Copy This macro will complete the interaction associated with the uniqueIdentifier if that interaction has not already completed automatically. You do not need to call this method. Rename a default interaction By default, the iOS agent will start an interaction trace when a new view controller is displayed. The interactions are named using the format Display <ViewController>. To change these default names with Objective-C, implement the - (NSString*) customNewRelicInteractionName instance method in your view controller, where the string returned becomes the interaction's name. Set a custom application version The New Relic iOS SDK allows you to set a custom application version string with Objective-C. Instead of using the string defined in CFBundleShortVersionString, call the +[NewRelic setApplicationVersion:] method and pass along the custom application version before calling +[NewRelic startWithApplicationToken:]; [NewRelic setApplicationVersion:(NSString*) appVersion]; Copy Set a custom build identifier As of version 5.1.0 of the New Relic iOS SDK, an API method allows you to set a custom build identifier that is displayed next to the application version in the Crash details page. Instead of using the CFBundleVersion string defined in Xcode with Objective-C, call the +[NewRelic setApplicationBuild:] method, and pass along the custom build identifier. [NewRelic setApplicationBuild:(NSString*) buildNumber]; Copy Create custom metrics Custom metrics can help track high level events specific to your application. With the recordMetric API, you can record arbitrary numerical data and named events with Objective-C and Swift. You can also use several API calls to record custom metrics that provide different levels of detail. Objective-C: Report custom attributes and events Use methods in the NewRelic object to report custom attributes and events. For details about the available methods for custom attributes and events with Objective-C, see the iOS SDK API reference. Methods that return BOOL results return YES if they succeed, or NO if the operation did not complete. These methods are available in versions 5.0.0 or higher of the New Relic iOS SDK. The SDK can store up to 128 user-defined custom attributes at a time. If you attempt to store more than 128 attributes, the SDK returns NO. Custom attributes names should use the simplest format needed, and New Relic recommends single word attributes, containing no spaces. Attribute phrases can be formatted in camel case, so My Custom Attribute is better specified as myCustomAttribute. As with custom metrics: Avoid using the characters / ] [ | * when naming things. Avoid multi-byte characters. Objective-C: Track custom network requests If you can express a transactional network request in terms similar to an HTTP request, you can track it. Use URLs that are well-formed and do not include highly variable paths or hostnames. For requests that complete, use this method: [NewRelic noticeNetworkRequestForURL:(NSURL*)url httpMethod:(NSString*)httpMethod withTimer:(NRTimer *)timer responseHeaders:(NSDictionary *)headers statusCode:(NSInteger)httpStatusCode bytesSent:(NSUInteger)bytesSent bytesReceived:(NSUInteger)bytesReceived responseData:(NSData *)responseData andParams:(NSDictionary *)params]; Copy Parameters include: Parameter Description url The URL of the request httpMethod The method type of the request; for example, POST, GET, etc. timer An NRTimer that timed the network request headers A dictionary containing the HTTP response headers, if available httpStatusCode The response status code If the httpStatusCode is greater than or equal to 400, the agent will record a server error and may capture the responseData body if provided. bytesSent The size of the request body bytesReceived The size of the responseBody responseData The response body data, captured if the agent records server error params params Additional parameters included in an HTTP error metric if the HTTP transaction is an error For requests that fail due to a socket or operating system error, use this method: [NewRelic noticeNetworkFailureForURL:(NSURL *)url httpMethod:(NSString*)httpMethod withTimer:(NRTimer *)timer andFailureCode:(NSInteger)iOSFailureCode]; Copy Parameters include: Parameter Description url The URL of the request httpMethod The method type of the request; for example, POST, GET, etc. timer An NRTimer that timed the network request iOSFailureCode The failure code Failure codes are interpreted as NSURLError* code. To view a complete list of supported codes, see NRConstants.h. Instrument your Swift code To have your own Swift code appear in interaction code breakdowns and timelines: Add a startTracingMethod() call to the beginning of your method. Add a endTracingMethodWithTimer() call to the end of it. Always include an endTracingMethodWithTimer() call for each startTracingMethod() reference. Include only one set of these commands in a given method. func myMethod(){ let timer = NRTimer(); NewRelic.startTracingMethod(#selector(MyClass.myMethod), object: self, timer: timer, category: NRTraceTypeNone) // … existing code NewRelic.endTracingMethodWithTimer(timer) } Copy If you want your method’s performance to be included in the summary data on the APM Overview page, pass one of the NRTraceType enum values into the startTracingMethod() macro; for example: NewRelic.startTracingMethod(#selector(MyClass.myMethod), object: self, timer: timer, category: NRTraceTypeDatabase) Copy Create and complete Swift interactions By default, an interaction starts when a view controller is pushed. To manually start an interaction, use these API calls: let uniqueIdentifier = NewRelic.startInteraction(withName: \"My Interaction\") Copy This call will automatically begin tracking an interaction trace named My Interaction from the current line. It will also complete any previously running interaction. It returns a unique identifier that can be used to complete that interaction by using this API call: NewRelic.stopCurrentInteraction(uniqueIdentifier) Copy This method will complete the interaction associated with the uniqueIdentifier if that interaction has not already completed automatically. You do not need to call this method. Rename a default Swift interaction By default, the iOS agent will start an interaction trace when a new view controller is displayed. The interactions are named using the format Display <ViewController>. To change these default names, implement the @objc func customNewRelicInteractionName() -> String method in your view controller, where the string returned becomes the interaction's name. Set a custom application version with Swift The New Relic iOS SDK allows you to set a custom application version string. Instead of using the string defined in CFBundleShortVersionString, call the NewRelic.setApplicationVersion() method, and pass along the custom application version before calling NewRelic.startWithApplicationToken();. NewRelic.setApplicationVersion(String appVersion) Copy Set a custom build identifier with Swift As of version 5.1.0 of the New Relic iOS SDK, an API method allows you to set a custom build identifier that is displayed next to the application version in the Crash details page. Instead of using the CFBundleVersion string defined in Xcode, call the NewRelic.setApplicationBuild() method, and pass along the custom build identifier.

For a general overview of mobile monitoring functionality, see Introduction to mobile monitoring. Compatibility and requirements Before you install the iOS agent, review the compatibility and requirements. Install the agent As part of the installation process, New Relic automatically generates an application token. This is a 40-character hexadecimal string for authenticating each mobile app that you monitor. There are two ways you can install the iOS agent: We recommend you install and configure the iOS agent using the CocoaPods installation method. You can also manually install and configure the iOS agent by adding the New Relic framework to your app. Extend your instrumentation After you install the agent, you can extend the agent's default instrumentation with various types of custom data: To access: In the mobile UI: In New Relic One dashboards: Custom data Create and record custom events, interaction traces, and attributes to add details to your existing data and traces. You can also query the custom events that you created in New Relic One dashboards and NRQL. Network requests Enable the MobileRequest event feature so you can perform a full network analysis. To further investigate network request error rates and response times, query MobileRequest and MobileRequestError events. Crash analysis Review detailed information using groups and filters to analyze trends that lead to crashes. To view more information about crashes, create NRQL queries to review Insights charts related to crash data. iOS SDK API Use the iOS SDK API to instrument parts of your code that are not instrumented by default. Then, view those custom events and attributes in New Relic Insights. Handled exceptions Report exceptions so you can identify factors creating a poor mobile app experience. To further improve performance, review MobileHandledException event records in New Relic Insights. Breadcrumbs Boost the level of detail in crash event trails by adding breadcrumbs. Then, query MobileBreadcrumbs events to see all breadcrumbs or just breadcrumbs related to crashes. Troubleshoot your installation If the agent isn't reporting data, try these troubleshooting suggestions.",

Include only one set of these commands in a given method. func myMethod(){ let timer = NRTimer(); NewRelic.startTracingMethod(#selector(MyClass.myMethod), object: self, timer: timer, category: NRTraceTypeNone) // … existing code NewRelic.endTracingMethodWithTimer(timer) } Copy If you want your method’s performance to be included in the summary data on the APM Overview page, pass one of the NRTraceType enum values into the startTracingMethod() macro; for example: NewRelic.startTracingMethod(#selector(MyClass.myMethod), object: self, timer: timer, category: NRTraceTypeDatabase) Copy Create and complete Swift interactions By default, an interaction starts when a view controller is pushed. To manually start an interaction, use these API calls: let uniqueIdentifier = NewRelic.startInteraction(withName: \"My Interaction\") Copy This call will automatically begin tracking an interaction trace named My Interaction from the current line. It will also complete any previously running interaction. It returns a unique identifier that can be used to complete that interaction by using this API call: NewRelic.stopCurrentInteraction(uniqueIdentifier) Copy This method will complete the interaction associated with the uniqueIdentifier if that interaction has not already completed automatically. You do not need to call this method. Rename a default Swift interaction By default, the iOS agent will start an interaction trace when a new view controller is displayed. The interactions are named using the format Display <ViewController>. To change these default names, implement the @objc func customNewRelicInteractionName() -> String method in your view controller, where the string returned becomes the interaction's name. Set a custom application version with Swift The New Relic iOS SDK allows you to set a custom application version string. Instead of using the string defined in CFBundleShortVersionString, call the NewRelic.setApplicationVersion() method, and pass along the custom application version before calling NewRelic.startWithApplicationToken();. NewRelic.setApplicationVersion(String appVersion) Copy Set a custom build identifier with Swift As of version 5.1.0 of the New Relic iOS SDK, an API method allows you to set a custom build identifier that is displayed next to the application version in the Crash details page. Instead of using the CFBundleVersion string defined in Xcode, call the NewRelic.setApplicationBuild() method, and pass along the custom build identifier. NewRelic.setApplicationBuild(buildNumber) Copy Create custom metrics with Swift Custom metrics can help track high level events specific to your application. With the recordMetric API, you can record arbitrary numerical data and named events with Objective-C and Swift. You can also use several API calls to record custom metrics that provide different levels of detail. Swift: Report custom attributes and events Use methods in the NewRelic object to report custom attributes and events. For details about the available methods for custom attributes and events with Swift, see the iOS SDK API reference. Methods that return BOOL results return YES if they succeed, or NO if the operation did not complete. These methods are available in versions 5.0.0 or higher of the New Relic iOS SDK. The SDK can store up to 128 user-defined custom attributes at a time. If you attempt to store more than 128 attributes, the SDK returns NO. Custom attributes names should use the simplest format needed, and New Relic recommends single word attributes, containing no spaces. Attribute phrases can be formatted in camel case, so My Custom Attribute is better specified as myCustomAttribute. As with custom metrics: Avoid using the characters / ] [ | * when naming things. Avoid multi-byte characters. Swift: Track custom network requests If you can express a transactional network request in terms similar to an HTTP request, you can track it. Use URLs that are well-formed and do not include highly variable paths or hostnames. For requests that complete, use this method: NewRelic.noticeNetworkRequestForURL(url: NSURL!, httpMethod: String!, withTimer: NRTimer!, responseHeaders:[NSObject : AnyObject]!, statusCode: Int, bytesSent: UInt, bytesReceived: UInt, responseData: NSData!, andParams: [NSObject : AnyObject]!) Copy Parameters include: Parameter Description url The URL of the request httpMethod The method type of the request; for example, POST, GET, etc. timer An NRTimer that timed the network request headers A dictionary containing the HTTP response headers, if available httpStatusCode The response status code If the httpStatusCode is greater than or equal to 400, the agent will record a server error and may capture the responseData body if provided. bytesSent The size of the request body bytesReceived The size of the responseBody responseData The response body data, captured if the agent records Server error params params Additional parameters included in an HTTP error metric if the HTTP transaction is an error For requests that fail due to a socket or operating system error, use this method: NewRelic.noticeNetworkFailureForURL(url: NSURL!, httpMethod: NSString!, withTimer: NRTimer!, andFailureCode: Int) Copy Parameters include: Parameter Description url The URL of the request httpMethod The method type of the request; for example, POST, GET, etc. timer An NRTimer that timed the network request iOSFailureCode The failure code Failure codes are interpreted as NSURLError* code.

For a general overview of mobile monitoring functionality, see Introduction to mobile monitoring. Compatibility and requirements Before you install the iOS agent, review the compatibility and requirements. Install the agent As part of the installation process, New Relic automatically generates an application token. This is a 40-character hexadecimal string for authenticating each mobile app that you monitor. There are two ways you can install the iOS agent: We recommend you install and configure the iOS agent using the CocoaPods installation method. You can also manually install and configure the iOS agent by adding the New Relic framework to your app. Extend your instrumentation After you install the agent, you can extend the agent's default instrumentation with various types of custom data: To access: In the mobile UI: In New Relic One dashboards: Custom data Create and record custom events, interaction traces, and attributes to add details to your existing data and traces. You can also query the custom events that you created in New Relic One dashboards and NRQL. Network requests Enable the MobileRequest event feature so you can perform a full network analysis. To further investigate network request error rates and response times, query MobileRequest and MobileRequestError events. Crash analysis Review detailed information using groups and filters to analyze trends that lead to crashes. To view more information about crashes, create NRQL queries to review Insights charts related to crash data. iOS SDK API Use the iOS SDK API to instrument parts of your code that are not instrumented by default. Then, view those custom events and attributes in New Relic Insights. Handled exceptions Report exceptions so you can identify factors creating a poor mobile app experience. To further improve performance, review MobileHandledException event records in New Relic Insights. Breadcrumbs Boost the level of detail in crash event trails by adding breadcrumbs. Then, query MobileBreadcrumbs events to see all breadcrumbs or just breadcrumbs related to crashes. Troubleshoot your installation If the agent isn't reporting data, try these troubleshooting suggestions.",

Summary categories include: View loading UI layout Database Images JSON Network Instrument your Objective-C code To have your own Objective-C code appear in interaction code breakdowns and timelines, add a _START call to the beginning of your method and a _STOP call to the end of it. Important Always include a _STOP for each _START, and only include one set of these commands in a given method. The trace system will automatically pick up the class and method name, and report performance metrics for your method to New Relic. - (void)myMethod { NR_TRACE_METHOD_START(0); // … existing code NR_TRACE_METHOD_STOP; } Copy If you are not using ARC, use this version of the _STOP macro to avoid memory leaks: NR_NONARC_TRACE_METHOD_STOP; Copy If you want your method’s performance to be included in the summary data on the APM Overview page, pass one of the NRTraceType enum values into the _START macro; for example: NR_TRACE_METHOD_START(NRTraceTypeDatabase); Copy Create and complete interactions By default, an interaction starts when a view controller is pushed.

Compatibility and requirements Before you install the iOS agent, review the compatibility and requirements. Install the agent As part of the installation process, New Relic automatically generates an application token. This is a 40-character hexadecimal string for authenticating each mobile app that you monitor. There are two ways you can install the iOS agent: We recommend you install and configure the iOS agent using the CocoaPods installation method. You can also manually install and configure the iOS agent by adding the New Relic framework to your app. Extend your instrumentation After you install the agent, you can extend the agent's default instrumentation with various types of custom data: To access: In the mobile UI: In New Relic One dashboards: Custom data Create and record custom events, interaction traces, and attributes to add details to your existing data and traces. You can also query the custom events that you created in New Relic One dashboards and NRQL. Network requests Enable the MobileRequest event feature so you can perform a full network analysis. To further investigate network request error rates and response times, query MobileRequest and MobileRequestError events. Crash analysis Review detailed information using groups and filters to analyze trends that lead to crashes. To view more information about crashes, create NRQL queries to review Insights charts related to crash data. iOS SDK API Use the iOS SDK API to instrument parts of your code that are not instrumented by default. Then, view those custom events and attributes in New Relic Insights. Handled exceptions Report exceptions so you can identify factors creating a poor mobile app experience. To further improve performance, review MobileHandledException event records in New Relic Insights. Breadcrumbs Boost the level of detail in crash event trails by adding breadcrumbs. Then, query MobileBreadcrumbs events to see all breadcrumbs or just breadcrumbs related to crashes.

      "body": "Use the iOS SDK API to add custom data. For example: Instrument your own code. Start and stop interaction traces from events in your mobile app. Record custom metrics. Send custom attributes and events to Insights. Track networking from libraries not supported automatically. Set a custom identifier value with Objective-C or Swift to associate user sessions with analysis events and attributes (iOS SDK version 5.9.0 or higher). Caution Tracing is heavily optimized, but it does impose a performance overhead. Avoid instrumenting methods that are expected to be called hundreds of times. Install the SDK Ensure you have your app instrumented with the latest iOS SDK by going to one.newrelic.com > Add more data and following the instructions for iOS. This document contains the iOS SDK instrumentation requirements for: Objective C Swift For details about the available methods for custom attributes and events you can send to to New Relic Insights, see the iOS SDK API reference. You can also configure feature flags for: Objective-C Swift Automatically instrumented classes and methods The following methods (for the listed classes and their sub-classes) are already instrumented by New Relic. You do not need to add custom instrumentation to trace them. Classes Methods automatically instrumented by New Relic UIViewController viewDidLoad: viewWillAppear: viewDidAppear: viewWillDisappear: viewDidDisappear: viewWillLayoutSubviews: viewDidLayoutSubviews: UIImage imageNamed: imageWithContentsOfFile: imageWithData: imageWithData:scale: initWithContentsOfFile: initWithData: initWithData:scale: NSJSONSerialization JSONObjectWithData:options:error: JSONObjectWithStream:options:error: dataWithJSONObject:options:error: writeJSONObject:toStream:options:error: NSManagedObjectContext executeFetchRequest:error: processPendingChanges The agent aggregates performance for various methods into summary metrics that appear in the Interactions page. Summary categories include: View loading UI layout Database Images JSON Network Instrument your Objective-C code To have your own Objective-C code appear in interaction code breakdowns and timelines, add a _START call to the beginning of your method and a _STOP call to the end of it. Important Always include a _STOP for each _START, and only include one set of these commands in a given method. The trace system will automatically pick up the class and method name, and report performance metrics for your method to New Relic. - (void)myMethod { NR_TRACE_METHOD_START(0); // … existing code NR_TRACE_METHOD_STOP; } Copy If you are not using ARC, use this version of the _STOP macro to avoid memory leaks: NR_NONARC_TRACE_METHOD_STOP; Copy If you want your method’s performance to be included in the summary data on the APM Overview page, pass one of the NRTraceType enum values into the _START macro; for example: NR_TRACE_METHOD_START(NRTraceTypeDatabase); Copy Create and complete interactions By default, an interaction starts when a view controller is pushed. To manually start an interaction with Objective-C, use these API calls: NSString* uniqueIdentifier = NR_START_NAMED_INTERACTION(@\"name\"); Copy This macro will automatically begin tracking the name interaction trace from the current line. It will also complete any previously running interaction. It returns a unique identifier that can be used to complete that interaction by using this API call: NR_INTERACTION_STOP(uniqueIdentifier); Copy This macro will complete the interaction associated with the uniqueIdentifier if that interaction has not already completed automatically. You do not need to call this method. Rename a default interaction By default, the iOS agent will start an interaction trace when a new view controller is displayed. The interactions are named using the format Display <ViewController>. To change these default names with Objective-C, implement the - (NSString*) customNewRelicInteractionName instance method in your view controller, where the string returned becomes the interaction's name. Set a custom application version The New Relic iOS SDK allows you to set a custom application version string with Objective-C. Instead of using the string defined in CFBundleShortVersionString, call the +[NewRelic setApplicationVersion:] method and pass along the custom application version before calling +[NewRelic startWithApplicationToken:]; [NewRelic setApplicationVersion:(NSString*) appVersion]; Copy Set a custom build identifier As of version 5.1.0 of the New Relic iOS SDK, an API method allows you to set a custom build identifier that is displayed next to the application version in the Crash details page. Instead of using the CFBundleVersion string defined in Xcode with Objective-C, call the +[NewRelic setApplicationBuild:] method, and pass along the custom build identifier. [NewRelic setApplicationBuild:(NSString*) buildNumber]; Copy Create custom metrics Custom metrics can help track high level events specific to your application. With the recordMetric API, you can record arbitrary numerical data and named events with Objective-C and Swift. You can also use several API calls to record custom metrics that provide different levels of detail. Objective-C: Report custom attributes and events Use methods in the NewRelic object to report custom attributes and events. For details about the available methods for custom attributes and events with Objective-C, see the iOS SDK API reference. Methods that return BOOL results return YES if they succeed, or NO if the operation did not complete. These methods are available in versions 5.0.0 or higher of the New Relic iOS SDK. The SDK can store up to 128 user-defined custom attributes at a time. If you attempt to store more than 128 attributes, the SDK returns NO. Custom attributes names should use the simplest format needed, and New Relic recommends single word attributes, containing no spaces. Attribute phrases can be formatted in camel case, so My Custom Attribute is better specified as myCustomAttribute. As with custom metrics: Avoid using the characters / ] [ | * when naming things. Avoid multi-byte characters. Objective-C: Track custom network requests If you can express a transactional network request in terms similar to an HTTP request, you can track it. Use URLs that are well-formed and do not include highly variable paths or hostnames. For requests that complete, use this method: [NewRelic noticeNetworkRequestForURL:(NSURL*)url httpMethod:(NSString*)httpMethod withTimer:(NRTimer *)timer responseHeaders:(NSDictionary *)headers statusCode:(NSInteger)httpStatusCode bytesSent:(NSUInteger)bytesSent bytesReceived:(NSUInteger)bytesReceived responseData:(NSData *)responseData andParams:(NSDictionary *)params]; Copy Parameters include: Parameter Description url The URL of the request httpMethod The method type of the request; for example, POST, GET, etc. timer An NRTimer that timed the network request headers A dictionary containing the HTTP response headers, if available httpStatusCode The response status code If the httpStatusCode is greater than or equal to 400, the agent will record a server error and may capture the responseData body if provided. bytesSent The size of the request body bytesReceived The size of the responseBody responseData The response body data, captured if the agent records server error params params Additional parameters included in an HTTP error metric if the HTTP transaction is an error For requests that fail due to a socket or operating system error, use this method: [NewRelic noticeNetworkFailureForURL:(NSURL *)url httpMethod:(NSString*)httpMethod withTimer:(NRTimer *)timer andFailureCode:(NSInteger)iOSFailureCode]; Copy Parameters include: Parameter Description url The URL of the request httpMethod The method type of the request; for example, POST, GET, etc. timer An NRTimer that timed the network request iOSFailureCode The failure code Failure codes are interpreted as NSURLError* code. To view a complete list of supported codes, see NRConstants.h. Instrument your Swift code To have your own Swift code appear in interaction code breakdowns and timelines: Add a startTracingMethod() call to the beginning of your method. Add a endTracingMethodWithTimer() call to the end of it. Always include an endTracingMethodWithTimer() call for each startTracingMethod() reference. Include only one set of these commands in a given method. func myMethod(){ let timer = NRTimer(); NewRelic.startTracingMethod(#selector(MyClass.myMethod), object: self, timer: timer, category: NRTraceTypeNone) // … existing code NewRelic.endTracingMethodWithTimer(timer) } Copy If you want your method’s performance to be included in the summary data on the APM Overview page, pass one of the NRTraceType enum values into the startTracingMethod() macro; for example: NewRelic.startTracingMethod(#selector(MyClass.myMethod), object: self, timer: timer, category: NRTraceTypeDatabase) Copy Create and complete Swift interactions By default, an interaction starts when a view controller is pushed. To manually start an interaction, use these API calls: let uniqueIdentifier = NewRelic.startInteraction(withName: \"My Interaction\") Copy This call will automatically begin tracking an interaction trace named My Interaction from the current line. It will also complete any previously running interaction. It returns a unique identifier that can be used to complete that interaction by using this API call: NewRelic.stopCurrentInteraction(uniqueIdentifier) Copy This method will complete the interaction associated with the uniqueIdentifier if that interaction has not already completed automatically. You do not need to call this method. Rename a default Swift interaction By default, the iOS agent will start an interaction trace when a new view controller is displayed. The interactions are named using the format Display <ViewController>. To change these default names, implement the @objc func customNewRelicInteractionName() -> String method in your view controller, where the string returned becomes the interaction's name. Set a custom application version with Swift The New Relic iOS SDK allows you to set a custom application version string. Instead of using the string defined in CFBundleShortVersionString, call the NewRelic.setApplicationVersion() method, and pass along the custom application version before calling NewRelic.startWithApplicationToken();. NewRelic.setApplicationVersion(String appVersion) Copy Set a custom build identifier with Swift As of version 5.1.0 of the New Relic iOS SDK, an API method allows you to set a custom build identifier that is displayed next to the application version in the Crash details page. Instead of using the CFBundleVersion string defined in Xcode, call the NewRelic.setApplicationBuild() method, and pass along the custom build identifier.

This document contains the iOS SDK instrumentation requirements for: Objective C Swift For details about the available methods for custom attributes and events you can send to to New Relic Insights, see the iOS SDK API reference. You can also configure feature flags for: Objective-C Swift Automatically instrumented classes and methods The following methods (for the listed classes and their sub-classes) are already instrumented by New Relic.

Summary categories include: View loading UI layout Database Images JSON Network Instrument your Objective-C code To have your own Objective-C code appear in interaction code breakdowns and timelines, add a _START call to the beginning of your method and a _STOP call to the end of it. Important Always include a _STOP for each _START, and only include one set of these commands in a given method. The trace system will automatically pick up the class and method name, and report performance metrics for your method to New Relic. - (void)myMethod { NR_TRACE_METHOD_START(0); // … existing code NR_TRACE_METHOD_STOP; } Copy If you are not using ARC, use this version of the _STOP macro to avoid memory leaks: NR_NONARC_TRACE_METHOD_STOP; Copy If you want your method’s performance to be included in the summary data on the APM Overview page, pass one of the NRTraceType enum values into the _START macro; for example: NR_TRACE_METHOD_START(NRTraceTypeDatabase); Copy Create and complete interactions By default, an interaction starts when a view controller is pushed. To manually start an interaction with Objective-C, use these API calls: NSString* uniqueIdentifier = NR_START_NAMED_INTERACTION(@\"name\"); Copy This macro will automatically begin tracking the name interaction trace from the current line. It will also complete any previously running interaction. It returns a unique identifier that can be used to complete that interaction by using this API call: NR_INTERACTION_STOP(uniqueIdentifier); Copy This macro will complete the interaction associated with the uniqueIdentifier if that interaction has not already completed automatically. You do not need to call this method. Rename a default interaction By default, the iOS agent will start an interaction trace when a new view controller is displayed. The interactions are named using the format Display <ViewController>. To change these default names with Objective-C, implement the - (NSString*) customNewRelicInteractionName instance method in your view controller, where the string returned becomes the interaction's name. Set a custom application version The New Relic iOS SDK allows you to set a custom application version string with Objective-C. Instead of using the string defined in CFBundleShortVersionString, call the +[NewRelic setApplicationVersion:] method and pass along the custom application version before calling +[NewRelic startWithApplicationToken:]; [NewRelic setApplicationVersion:(NSString*) appVersion]; Copy Set a custom build identifier As of version 5.1.0 of the New Relic iOS SDK, an API method allows you to set a custom build identifier that is displayed next to the application version in the Crash details page. Instead of using the CFBundleVersion string defined in Xcode with Objective-C, call the +[NewRelic setApplicationBuild:] method, and pass along the custom build identifier. [NewRelic setApplicationBuild:(NSString*) buildNumber]; Copy Create custom metrics Custom metrics can help track high level events specific to your application. With the recordMetric API, you can record arbitrary numerical data and named events with Objective-C and Swift. You can also use several API calls to record custom metrics that provide different levels of detail. Objective-C: Report custom attributes and events Use methods in the NewRelic object to report custom attributes and events. For details about the available methods for custom attributes and events with Objective-C, see the iOS SDK API reference. Methods that return BOOL results return YES if they succeed, or NO if the operation did not complete. These methods are available in versions 5.0.0 or higher of the New Relic iOS SDK. The SDK can store up to 128 user-defined custom attributes at a time. If you attempt to store more than 128 attributes, the SDK returns NO. Custom attributes names should use the simplest format needed, and New Relic recommends single word attributes, containing no spaces. Attribute phrases can be formatted in camel case, so My Custom Attribute is better specified as myCustomAttribute. As with custom metrics: Avoid using the characters / ] [ | * when naming things. Avoid multi-byte characters. Objective-C: Track custom network requests If you can express a transactional network request in terms similar to an HTTP request, you can track it. Use URLs that are well-formed and do not include highly variable paths or hostnames. For requests that complete, use this method: [NewRelic noticeNetworkRequestForURL:(NSURL*)url httpMethod:(NSString*)httpMethod withTimer:(NRTimer *)timer responseHeaders:(NSDictionary *)headers statusCode:(NSInteger)httpStatusCode bytesSent:(NSUInteger)bytesSent bytesReceived:(NSUInteger)bytesReceived responseData:(NSData *)responseData andParams:(NSDictionary *)params]; Copy Parameters include: Parameter Description url The URL of the request httpMethod The method type of the request; for example, POST, GET, etc. timer An NRTimer that timed the network request headers A dictionary containing the HTTP response headers, if available httpStatusCode The response status code If the httpStatusCode is greater than or equal to 400, the agent will record a server error and may capture the responseData body if provided. bytesSent The size of the request body bytesReceived The size of the responseBody responseData The response body data, captured if the agent records server error params params Additional parameters included in an HTTP error metric if the HTTP transaction is an error For requests that fail due to a socket or operating system error, use this method: [NewRelic noticeNetworkFailureForURL:(NSURL *)url httpMethod:(NSString*)httpMethod withTimer:(NRTimer *)timer andFailureCode:(NSInteger)iOSFailureCode]; Copy Parameters include: Parameter Description url The URL of the request httpMethod The method type of the request; for example, POST, GET, etc. timer An NRTimer that timed the network request iOSFailureCode The failure code Failure codes are interpreted as NSURLError* code. To view a complete list of supported codes, see NRConstants.h. Instrument your Swift code To have your own Swift code appear in interaction code breakdowns and timelines: Add a startTracingMethod() call to the beginning of your method. Add a endTracingMethodWithTimer() call to the end of it. Always include an endTracingMethodWithTimer() call for each startTracingMethod() reference. Include only one set of these commands in a given method. func myMethod(){ let timer = NRTimer(); NewRelic.startTracingMethod(#selector(MyClass.myMethod), object: self, timer: timer, category: NRTraceTypeNone) // … existing code NewRelic.endTracingMethodWithTimer(timer) } Copy If you want your method’s performance to be included in the summary data on the APM Overview page, pass one of the NRTraceType enum values into the startTracingMethod() macro; for example: NewRelic.startTracingMethod(#selector(MyClass.myMethod), object: self, timer: timer, category: NRTraceTypeDatabase) Copy Create and complete Swift interactions By default, an interaction starts when a view controller is pushed. To manually start an interaction, use these API calls: let uniqueIdentifier = NewRelic.startInteraction(withName: \"My Interaction\") Copy This call will automatically begin tracking an interaction trace named My Interaction from the current line. It will also complete any previously running interaction. It returns a unique identifier that can be used to complete that interaction by using this API call: NewRelic.stopCurrentInteraction(uniqueIdentifier) Copy This method will complete the interaction associated with the uniqueIdentifier if that interaction has not already completed automatically. You do not need to call this method. Rename a default Swift interaction By default, the iOS agent will start an interaction trace when a new view controller is displayed. The interactions are named using the format Display <ViewController>. To change these default names, implement the @objc func customNewRelicInteractionName() -> String method in your view controller, where the string returned becomes the interaction's name. Set a custom application version with Swift The New Relic iOS SDK allows you to set a custom application version string. Instead of using the string defined in CFBundleShortVersionString, call the NewRelic.setApplicationVersion() method, and pass along the custom application version before calling NewRelic.startWithApplicationToken();. NewRelic.setApplicationVersion(String appVersion) Copy Set a custom build identifier with Swift As of version 5.1.0 of the New Relic iOS SDK, an API method allows you to set a custom build identifier that is displayed next to the application version in the Crash details page. Instead of using the CFBundleVersion string defined in Xcode, call the NewRelic.setApplicationBuild() method, and pass along the custom build identifier.

For a general overview of mobile monitoring functionality, see Introduction to mobile monitoring. Compatibility and requirements Before you install the iOS agent, review the compatibility and requirements. Install the agent As part of the installation process, New Relic automatically generates an application token. This is a 40-character hexadecimal string for authenticating each mobile app that you monitor. There are two ways you can install the iOS agent: We recommend you install and configure the iOS agent using the CocoaPods installation method. You can also manually install and configure the iOS agent by adding the New Relic framework to your app. Extend your instrumentation After you install the agent, you can extend the agent's default instrumentation with various types of custom data: To access: In the mobile UI: In New Relic One dashboards: Custom data Create and record custom events, interaction traces, and attributes to add details to your existing data and traces. You can also query the custom events that you created in New Relic One dashboards and NRQL. Network requests Enable the MobileRequest event feature so you can perform a full network analysis. To further investigate network request error rates and response times, query MobileRequest and MobileRequestError events. Crash analysis Review detailed information using groups and filters to analyze trends that lead to crashes. To view more information about crashes, create NRQL queries to review Insights charts related to crash data. iOS SDK API Use the iOS SDK API to instrument parts of your code that are not instrumented by default. Then, view those custom events and attributes in New Relic Insights. Handled exceptions Report exceptions so you can identify factors creating a poor mobile app experience. To further improve performance, review MobileHandledException event records in New Relic Insights. Breadcrumbs Boost the level of detail in crash event trails by adding breadcrumbs. Then, query MobileBreadcrumbs events to see all breadcrumbs or just breadcrumbs related to crashes. Troubleshoot your installation If the agent isn't reporting data, try these troubleshooting suggestions.",

Attribute phrases can be formatted in camel case, so My Custom Attribute is better specified as myCustomAttribute. As with custom metrics: Avoid using the characters / ] [ | * when naming things. Avoid multi-byte characters. Objective-C: Track custom network requests If you can express a transactional network request in terms similar to an HTTP request, you can track it. Use URLs that are well-formed and do not include highly variable paths or hostnames. For requests that complete, use this method: [NewRelic noticeNetworkRequestForURL:(NSURL*)url httpMethod:(NSString*)httpMethod withTimer:(NRTimer *)timer responseHeaders:(NSDictionary *)headers statusCode:(NSInteger)httpStatusCode bytesSent:(NSUInteger)bytesSent bytesReceived:(NSUInteger)bytesReceived responseData:(NSData *)responseData andParams:(NSDictionary *)params]; Copy Parameters include: Parameter Description url The URL of the request httpMethod The method type of the request; for example, POST, GET, etc. timer An NRTimer that timed the network request headers A dictionary containing the HTTP response headers, if available httpStatusCode The response status code If the httpStatusCode is greater than or equal to 400, the agent will record a server error and may capture the responseData body if provided. bytesSent The size of the request body bytesReceived The size of the responseBody responseData The response body data, captured if the agent records server error params params Additional parameters included in an HTTP error metric if the HTTP transaction is an error For requests that fail due to a socket or operating system error, use this method: [NewRelic noticeNetworkFailureForURL:(NSURL *)url httpMethod:(NSString*)httpMethod withTimer:(NRTimer *)timer andFailureCode:(NSInteger)iOSFailureCode]; Copy Parameters include: Parameter Description url The URL of the request httpMethod The method type of the request; for example, POST, GET, etc. timer An NRTimer that timed the network request iOSFailureCode The failure code Failure codes are interpreted as NSURLError* code. To view a complete list of supported codes, see NRConstants.h. Instrument your Swift code To have your own Swift code appear in interaction code breakdowns and timelines: Add a startTracingMethod() call to the beginning of your method. Add a endTracingMethodWithTimer() call to the end of it. Always include an endTracingMethodWithTimer() call for each startTracingMethod() reference. Include only one set of these commands in a given method. func myMethod(){ let timer = NRTimer(); NewRelic.startTracingMethod(#selector(MyClass.myMethod), object: self, timer: timer, category: NRTraceTypeNone) // … existing code NewRelic.endTracingMethodWithTimer(timer) } Copy If you want your method’s performance to be included in the summary data on the APM Overview page, pass one of the NRTraceType enum values into the startTracingMethod() macro; for example: NewRelic.startTracingMethod(#selector(MyClass.myMethod), object: self, timer: timer, category: NRTraceTypeDatabase) Copy Create and complete Swift interactions By default, an interaction starts when a view controller is pushed. To manually start an interaction, use these API calls: let uniqueIdentifier = NewRelic.startInteraction(withName: \"My Interaction\") Copy This call will automatically begin tracking an interaction trace named My Interaction from the current line. It will also complete any previously running interaction. It returns a unique identifier that can be used to complete that interaction by using this API call: NewRelic.stopCurrentInteraction(uniqueIdentifier) Copy This method will complete the interaction associated with the uniqueIdentifier if that interaction has not already completed automatically. You do not need to call this method. Rename a default Swift interaction By default, the iOS agent will start an interaction trace when a new view controller is displayed. The interactions are named using the format Display <ViewController>. To change these default names, implement the @objc func customNewRelicInteractionName() -> String method in your view controller, where the string returned becomes the interaction's name. Set a custom application version with Swift The New Relic iOS SDK allows you to set a custom application version string. Instead of using the string defined in CFBundleShortVersionString, call the NewRelic.setApplicationVersion() method, and pass along the custom application version before calling NewRelic.startWithApplicationToken();. NewRelic.setApplicationVersion(String appVersion) Copy Set a custom build identifier with Swift As of version 5.1.0 of the New Relic iOS SDK, an API method allows you to set a custom build identifier that is displayed next to the application version in the Crash details page. Instead of using the CFBundleVersion string defined in Xcode, call the NewRelic.setApplicationBuild() method, and pass along the custom build identifier. NewRelic.setApplicationBuild(buildNumber) Copy Create custom metrics with Swift Custom metrics can help track high level events specific to your application. With the recordMetric API, you can record arbitrary numerical data and named events with Objective-C and Swift. You can also use several API calls to record custom metrics that provide different levels of detail. Swift: Report custom attributes and events Use methods in the NewRelic object to report custom attributes and events. For details about the available methods for custom attributes and events with Swift, see the iOS SDK API reference. Methods that return BOOL results return YES if they succeed, or NO if the operation did not complete. These methods are available in versions 5.0.0 or higher of the New Relic iOS SDK. The SDK can store up to 128 user-defined custom attributes at a time. If you attempt to store more than 128 attributes, the SDK returns NO. Custom attributes names should use the simplest format needed, and New Relic recommends single word attributes, containing no spaces. Attribute phrases can be formatted in camel case, so My Custom Attribute is better specified as myCustomAttribute. As with custom metrics: Avoid using the characters / ] [ | * when naming things. Avoid multi-byte characters. Swift: Track custom network requests If you can express a transactional network request in terms similar to an HTTP request, you can track it. Use URLs that are well-formed and do not include highly variable paths or hostnames. For requests that complete, use this method: NewRelic.noticeNetworkRequestForURL(url: NSURL!, httpMethod: String!, withTimer: NRTimer!, responseHeaders:[NSObject : AnyObject]!, statusCode: Int, bytesSent: UInt, bytesReceived: UInt, responseData: NSData!, andParams: [NSObject : AnyObject]!) Copy Parameters include: Parameter Description url The URL of the request httpMethod The method type of the request; for example, POST, GET, etc. timer An NRTimer that timed the network request headers A dictionary containing the HTTP response headers, if available httpStatusCode The response status code If the httpStatusCode is greater than or equal to 400, the agent will record a server error and may capture the responseData body if provided. bytesSent The size of the request body bytesReceived The size of the responseBody responseData The response body data, captured if the agent records Server error params params Additional parameters included in an HTTP error metric if the HTTP transaction is an error For requests that fail due to a socket or operating system error, use this method: NewRelic.noticeNetworkFailureForURL(url: NSURL!, httpMethod: NSString!, withTimer: NRTimer!, andFailureCode: Int) Copy Parameters include: Parameter Description url The URL of the request httpMethod The method type of the request; for example, POST, GET, etc. timer An NRTimer that timed the network request iOSFailureCode The failure code Failure codes are interpreted as NSURLError* code.

For a general overview of mobile monitoring functionality, see Introduction to mobile monitoring. Compatibility and requirements Before you install the iOS agent, review the compatibility and requirements. Install the agent As part of the installation process, New Relic automatically generates an application token. This is a 40-character hexadecimal string for authenticating each mobile app that you monitor. There are two ways you can install the iOS agent: We recommend you install and configure the iOS agent using the CocoaPods installation method. You can also manually install and configure the iOS agent by adding the New Relic framework to your app. Extend your instrumentation After you install the agent, you can extend the agent's default instrumentation with various types of custom data: To access: In the mobile UI: In New Relic One dashboards: Custom data Create and record custom events, interaction traces, and attributes to add details to your existing data and traces. You can also query the custom events that you created in New Relic One dashboards and NRQL. Network requests Enable the MobileRequest event feature so you can perform a full network analysis. To further investigate network request error rates and response times, query MobileRequest and MobileRequestError events. Crash analysis Review detailed information using groups and filters to analyze trends that lead to crashes. To view more information about crashes, create NRQL queries to review Insights charts related to crash data. iOS SDK API Use the iOS SDK API to instrument parts of your code that are not instrumented by default. Then, view those custom events and attributes in New Relic Insights. Handled exceptions Report exceptions so you can identify factors creating a poor mobile app experience. To further improve performance, review MobileHandledException event records in New Relic Insights. Breadcrumbs Boost the level of detail in crash event trails by adding breadcrumbs. Then, query MobileBreadcrumbs events to see all breadcrumbs or just breadcrumbs related to crashes. Troubleshoot your installation If the agent isn't reporting data, try these troubleshooting suggestions.",

Summary categories include: View loading UI layout Database Images JSON Network Instrument your Objective-C code To have your own Objective-C code appear in interaction code breakdowns and timelines, add a _START call to the beginning of your method and a _STOP call to the end of it. Important Always include a _STOP for each _START, and only include one set of these commands in a given method. The trace system will automatically pick up the class and method name, and report performance metrics for your method to New Relic. - (void)myMethod { NR_TRACE_METHOD_START(0); // … existing code NR_TRACE_METHOD_STOP; } Copy If you are not using ARC, use this version of the _STOP macro to avoid memory leaks: NR_NONARC_TRACE_METHOD_STOP; Copy If you want your method’s performance to be included in the summary data on the APM Overview page, pass one of the NRTraceType enum values into the _START macro; for example: NR_TRACE_METHOD_START(NRTraceTypeDatabase); Copy Create and complete interactions By default, an interaction starts when a view controller is pushed.

There are two ways you can install the iOS agent: We recommend you install and configure the iOS agent using the CocoaPods installation method. You can also manually install and configure the iOS agent by adding the New Relic framework to your app. Extend your instrumentation After you install the agent, you can extend the agent's default instrumentation with various types of custom data: To access: In the mobile UI: In New Relic One dashboards: Custom data Create and record custom events, interaction traces, and attributes to add details to your existing data and traces. You can also query the custom events that you created in New Relic One dashboards and NRQL. Network requests Enable the MobileRequest event feature so you can perform a full network analysis. To further investigate network request error rates and response times, query MobileRequest and MobileRequestError events. Crash analysis Review detailed information using groups and filters to analyze trends that lead to crashes. To view more information about crashes, create NRQL queries to review Insights charts related to crash data. iOS SDK API Use the iOS SDK API to instrument parts of your code that are not instrumented by default. Then, view those custom events and attributes in New Relic Insights. Handled exceptions Report exceptions so you can identify factors creating a poor mobile app experience. To further improve performance, review MobileHandledException event records in New Relic Insights. Breadcrumbs Boost the level of detail in crash event trails by adding breadcrumbs.

      "body": "Use the iOS SDK API to add custom data. For example: Instrument your own code. Start and stop interaction traces from events in your mobile app. Record custom metrics. Send custom attributes and events to Insights. Track networking from libraries not supported automatically. Set a custom identifier value with Objective-C or Swift to associate user sessions with analysis events and attributes (iOS SDK version 5.9.0 or higher). Caution Tracing is heavily optimized, but it does impose a performance overhead. Avoid instrumenting methods that are expected to be called hundreds of times. Install the SDK Ensure you have your app instrumented with the latest iOS SDK by going to one.newrelic.com > Add more data and following the instructions for iOS. This document contains the iOS SDK instrumentation requirements for: Objective C Swift For details about the available methods for custom attributes and events you can send to to New Relic Insights, see the iOS SDK API reference. You can also configure feature flags for: Objective-C Swift Automatically instrumented classes and methods The following methods (for the listed classes and their sub-classes) are already instrumented by New Relic. You do not need to add custom instrumentation to trace them. Classes Methods automatically instrumented by New Relic UIViewController viewDidLoad: viewWillAppear: viewDidAppear: viewWillDisappear: viewDidDisappear: viewWillLayoutSubviews: viewDidLayoutSubviews: UIImage imageNamed: imageWithContentsOfFile: imageWithData: imageWithData:scale: initWithContentsOfFile: initWithData: initWithData:scale: NSJSONSerialization JSONObjectWithData:options:error: JSONObjectWithStream:options:error: dataWithJSONObject:options:error: writeJSONObject:toStream:options:error: NSManagedObjectContext executeFetchRequest:error: processPendingChanges The agent aggregates performance for various methods into summary metrics that appear in the Interactions page. Summary categories include: View loading UI layout Database Images JSON Network Instrument your Objective-C code To have your own Objective-C code appear in interaction code breakdowns and timelines, add a _START call to the beginning of your method and a _STOP call to the end of it. Important Always include a _STOP for each _START, and only include one set of these commands in a given method. The trace system will automatically pick up the class and method name, and report performance metrics for your method to New Relic. - (void)myMethod { NR_TRACE_METHOD_START(0); // … existing code NR_TRACE_METHOD_STOP; } Copy If you are not using ARC, use this version of the _STOP macro to avoid memory leaks: NR_NONARC_TRACE_METHOD_STOP; Copy If you want your method’s performance to be included in the summary data on the APM Overview page, pass one of the NRTraceType enum values into the _START macro; for example: NR_TRACE_METHOD_START(NRTraceTypeDatabase); Copy Create and complete interactions By default, an interaction starts when a view controller is pushed. To manually start an interaction with Objective-C, use these API calls: NSString* uniqueIdentifier = NR_START_NAMED_INTERACTION(@\"name\"); Copy This macro will automatically begin tracking the name interaction trace from the current line. It will also complete any previously running interaction. It returns a unique identifier that can be used to complete that interaction by using this API call: NR_INTERACTION_STOP(uniqueIdentifier); Copy This macro will complete the interaction associated with the uniqueIdentifier if that interaction has not already completed automatically. You do not need to call this method. Rename a default interaction By default, the iOS agent will start an interaction trace when a new view controller is displayed. The interactions are named using the format Display <ViewController>. To change these default names with Objective-C, implement the - (NSString*) customNewRelicInteractionName instance method in your view controller, where the string returned becomes the interaction's name. Set a custom application version The New Relic iOS SDK allows you to set a custom application version string with Objective-C. Instead of using the string defined in CFBundleShortVersionString, call the +[NewRelic setApplicationVersion:] method and pass along the custom application version before calling +[NewRelic startWithApplicationToken:]; [NewRelic setApplicationVersion:(NSString*) appVersion]; Copy Set a custom build identifier As of version 5.1.0 of the New Relic iOS SDK, an API method allows you to set a custom build identifier that is displayed next to the application version in the Crash details page. Instead of using the CFBundleVersion string defined in Xcode with Objective-C, call the +[NewRelic setApplicationBuild:] method, and pass along the custom build identifier. [NewRelic setApplicationBuild:(NSString*) buildNumber]; Copy Create custom metrics Custom metrics can help track high level events specific to your application. With the recordMetric API, you can record arbitrary numerical data and named events with Objective-C and Swift. You can also use several API calls to record custom metrics that provide different levels of detail. Objective-C: Report custom attributes and events Use methods in the NewRelic object to report custom attributes and events. For details about the available methods for custom attributes and events with Objective-C, see the iOS SDK API reference. Methods that return BOOL results return YES if they succeed, or NO if the operation did not complete. These methods are available in versions 5.0.0 or higher of the New Relic iOS SDK. The SDK can store up to 128 user-defined custom attributes at a time. If you attempt to store more than 128 attributes, the SDK returns NO. Custom attributes names should use the simplest format needed, and New Relic recommends single word attributes, containing no spaces. Attribute phrases can be formatted in camel case, so My Custom Attribute is better specified as myCustomAttribute. As with custom metrics: Avoid using the characters / ] [ | * when naming things. Avoid multi-byte characters. Objective-C: Track custom network requests If you can express a transactional network request in terms similar to an HTTP request, you can track it. Use URLs that are well-formed and do not include highly variable paths or hostnames. For requests that complete, use this method: [NewRelic noticeNetworkRequestForURL:(NSURL*)url httpMethod:(NSString*)httpMethod withTimer:(NRTimer *)timer responseHeaders:(NSDictionary *)headers statusCode:(NSInteger)httpStatusCode bytesSent:(NSUInteger)bytesSent bytesReceived:(NSUInteger)bytesReceived responseData:(NSData *)responseData andParams:(NSDictionary *)params]; Copy Parameters include: Parameter Description url The URL of the request httpMethod The method type of the request; for example, POST, GET, etc. timer An NRTimer that timed the network request headers A dictionary containing the HTTP response headers, if available httpStatusCode The response status code If the httpStatusCode is greater than or equal to 400, the agent will record a server error and may capture the responseData body if provided. bytesSent The size of the request body bytesReceived The size of the responseBody responseData The response body data, captured if the agent records server error params params Additional parameters included in an HTTP error metric if the HTTP transaction is an error For requests that fail due to a socket or operating system error, use this method: [NewRelic noticeNetworkFailureForURL:(NSURL *)url httpMethod:(NSString*)httpMethod withTimer:(NRTimer *)timer andFailureCode:(NSInteger)iOSFailureCode]; Copy Parameters include: Parameter Description url The URL of the request httpMethod The method type of the request; for example, POST, GET, etc. timer An NRTimer that timed the network request iOSFailureCode The failure code Failure codes are interpreted as NSURLError* code. To view a complete list of supported codes, see NRConstants.h. Instrument your Swift code To have your own Swift code appear in interaction code breakdowns and timelines: Add a startTracingMethod() call to the beginning of your method. Add a endTracingMethodWithTimer() call to the end of it. Always include an endTracingMethodWithTimer() call for each startTracingMethod() reference. Include only one set of these commands in a given method. func myMethod(){ let timer = NRTimer(); NewRelic.startTracingMethod(#selector(MyClass.myMethod), object: self, timer: timer, category: NRTraceTypeNone) // … existing code NewRelic.endTracingMethodWithTimer(timer) } Copy If you want your method’s performance to be included in the summary data on the APM Overview page, pass one of the NRTraceType enum values into the startTracingMethod() macro; for example: NewRelic.startTracingMethod(#selector(MyClass.myMethod), object: self, timer: timer, category: NRTraceTypeDatabase) Copy Create and complete Swift interactions By default, an interaction starts when a view controller is pushed. To manually start an interaction, use these API calls: let uniqueIdentifier = NewRelic.startInteraction(withName: \"My Interaction\") Copy This call will automatically begin tracking an interaction trace named My Interaction from the current line. It will also complete any previously running interaction. It returns a unique identifier that can be used to complete that interaction by using this API call: NewRelic.stopCurrentInteraction(uniqueIdentifier) Copy This method will complete the interaction associated with the uniqueIdentifier if that interaction has not already completed automatically. You do not need to call this method. Rename a default Swift interaction By default, the iOS agent will start an interaction trace when a new view controller is displayed. The interactions are named using the format Display <ViewController>. To change these default names, implement the @objc func customNewRelicInteractionName() -> String method in your view controller, where the string returned becomes the interaction's name. Set a custom application version with Swift The New Relic iOS SDK allows you to set a custom application version string. Instead of using the string defined in CFBundleShortVersionString, call the NewRelic.setApplicationVersion() method, and pass along the custom application version before calling NewRelic.startWithApplicationToken();. NewRelic.setApplicationVersion(String appVersion) Copy Set a custom build identifier with Swift As of version 5.1.0 of the New Relic iOS SDK, an API method allows you to set a custom build identifier that is displayed next to the application version in the Crash details page. Instead of using the CFBundleVersion string defined in Xcode, call the NewRelic.setApplicationBuild() method, and pass along the custom build identifier.

      "body": "Use the iOS SDK API to add custom data. For example: Instrument your own code. Start and stop interaction traces from events in your mobile app. Record custom metrics. Send custom attributes and events to Insights. Track networking from libraries not supported automatically. Set a custom identifier value with Objective-C or Swift to associate user sessions with analysis events and attributes (iOS SDK version 5.9.0 or higher). Caution Tracing is heavily optimized, but it does impose a performance overhead. Avoid instrumenting methods that are expected to be called hundreds of times. Install the SDK Ensure you have your app instrumented with the latest iOS SDK by going to one.newrelic.com > Add more data and following the instructions for iOS. This document contains the iOS SDK instrumentation requirements for: Objective C Swift For details about the available methods for custom attributes and events you can send to to New Relic Insights, see the iOS SDK API reference. You can also configure feature flags for: Objective-C Swift Automatically instrumented classes and methods The following methods (for the listed classes and their sub-classes) are already instrumented by New Relic. You do not need to add custom instrumentation to trace them. Classes Methods automatically instrumented by New Relic UIViewController viewDidLoad: viewWillAppear: viewDidAppear: viewWillDisappear: viewDidDisappear: viewWillLayoutSubviews: viewDidLayoutSubviews: UIImage imageNamed: imageWithContentsOfFile: imageWithData: imageWithData:scale: initWithContentsOfFile: initWithData: initWithData:scale: NSJSONSerialization JSONObjectWithData:options:error: JSONObjectWithStream:options:error: dataWithJSONObject:options:error: writeJSONObject:toStream:options:error: NSManagedObjectContext executeFetchRequest:error: processPendingChanges The agent aggregates performance for various methods into summary metrics that appear in the Interactions page. Summary categories include: View loading UI layout Database Images JSON Network Instrument your Objective-C code To have your own Objective-C code appear in interaction code breakdowns and timelines, add a _START call to the beginning of your method and a _STOP call to the end of it. Important Always include a _STOP for each _START, and only include one set of these commands in a given method. The trace system will automatically pick up the class and method name, and report performance metrics for your method to New Relic. - (void)myMethod { NR_TRACE_METHOD_START(0); // … existing code NR_TRACE_METHOD_STOP; } Copy If you are not using ARC, use this version of the _STOP macro to avoid memory leaks: NR_NONARC_TRACE_METHOD_STOP; Copy If you want your method’s performance to be included in the summary data on the APM Overview page, pass one of the NRTraceType enum values into the _START macro; for example: NR_TRACE_METHOD_START(NRTraceTypeDatabase); Copy Create and complete interactions By default, an interaction starts when a view controller is pushed. To manually start an interaction with Objective-C, use these API calls: NSString* uniqueIdentifier = NR_START_NAMED_INTERACTION(@\"name\"); Copy This macro will automatically begin tracking the name interaction trace from the current line. It will also complete any previously running interaction. It returns a unique identifier that can be used to complete that interaction by using this API call: NR_INTERACTION_STOP(uniqueIdentifier); Copy This macro will complete the interaction associated with the uniqueIdentifier if that interaction has not already completed automatically. You do not need to call this method. Rename a default interaction By default, the iOS agent will start an interaction trace when a new view controller is displayed. The interactions are named using the format Display <ViewController>. To change these default names with Objective-C, implement the - (NSString*) customNewRelicInteractionName instance method in your view controller, where the string returned becomes the interaction's name. Set a custom application version The New Relic iOS SDK allows you to set a custom application version string with Objective-C. Instead of using the string defined in CFBundleShortVersionString, call the +[NewRelic setApplicationVersion:] method and pass along the custom application version before calling +[NewRelic startWithApplicationToken:]; [NewRelic setApplicationVersion:(NSString*) appVersion]; Copy Set a custom build identifier As of version 5.1.0 of the New Relic iOS SDK, an API method allows you to set a custom build identifier that is displayed next to the application version in the Crash details page. Instead of using the CFBundleVersion string defined in Xcode with Objective-C, call the +[NewRelic setApplicationBuild:] method, and pass along the custom build identifier. [NewRelic setApplicationBuild:(NSString*) buildNumber]; Copy Create custom metrics Custom metrics can help track high level events specific to your application. With the recordMetric API, you can record arbitrary numerical data and named events with Objective-C and Swift. You can also use several API calls to record custom metrics that provide different levels of detail. Objective-C: Report custom attributes and events Use methods in the NewRelic object to report custom attributes and events. For details about the available methods for custom attributes and events with Objective-C, see the iOS SDK API reference. Methods that return BOOL results return YES if they succeed, or NO if the operation did not complete. These methods are available in versions 5.0.0 or higher of the New Relic iOS SDK. The SDK can store up to 128 user-defined custom attributes at a time. If you attempt to store more than 128 attributes, the SDK returns NO. Custom attributes names should use the simplest format needed, and New Relic recommends single word attributes, containing no spaces. Attribute phrases can be formatted in camel case, so My Custom Attribute is better specified as myCustomAttribute. As with custom metrics: Avoid using the characters / ] [ | * when naming things. Avoid multi-byte characters. Objective-C: Track custom network requests If you can express a transactional network request in terms similar to an HTTP request, you can track it. Use URLs that are well-formed and do not include highly variable paths or hostnames. For requests that complete, use this method: [NewRelic noticeNetworkRequestForURL:(NSURL*)url httpMethod:(NSString*)httpMethod withTimer:(NRTimer *)timer responseHeaders:(NSDictionary *)headers statusCode:(NSInteger)httpStatusCode bytesSent:(NSUInteger)bytesSent bytesReceived:(NSUInteger)bytesReceived responseData:(NSData *)responseData andParams:(NSDictionary *)params]; Copy Parameters include: Parameter Description url The URL of the request httpMethod The method type of the request; for example, POST, GET, etc. timer An NRTimer that timed the network request headers A dictionary containing the HTTP response headers, if available httpStatusCode The response status code If the httpStatusCode is greater than or equal to 400, the agent will record a server error and may capture the responseData body if provided. bytesSent The size of the request body bytesReceived The size of the responseBody responseData The response body data, captured if the agent records server error params params Additional parameters included in an HTTP error metric if the HTTP transaction is an error For requests that fail due to a socket or operating system error, use this method: [NewRelic noticeNetworkFailureForURL:(NSURL *)url httpMethod:(NSString*)httpMethod withTimer:(NRTimer *)timer andFailureCode:(NSInteger)iOSFailureCode]; Copy Parameters include: Parameter Description url The URL of the request httpMethod The method type of the request; for example, POST, GET, etc. timer An NRTimer that timed the network request iOSFailureCode The failure code Failure codes are interpreted as NSURLError* code. To view a complete list of supported codes, see NRConstants.h. Instrument your Swift code To have your own Swift code appear in interaction code breakdowns and timelines: Add a startTracingMethod() call to the beginning of your method. Add a endTracingMethodWithTimer() call to the end of it. Always include an endTracingMethodWithTimer() call for each startTracingMethod() reference. Include only one set of these commands in a given method. func myMethod(){ let timer = NRTimer(); NewRelic.startTracingMethod(#selector(MyClass.myMethod), object: self, timer: timer, category: NRTraceTypeNone) // … existing code NewRelic.endTracingMethodWithTimer(timer) } Copy If you want your method’s performance to be included in the summary data on the APM Overview page, pass one of the NRTraceType enum values into the startTracingMethod() macro; for example: NewRelic.startTracingMethod(#selector(MyClass.myMethod), object: self, timer: timer, category: NRTraceTypeDatabase) Copy Create and complete Swift interactions By default, an interaction starts when a view controller is pushed. To manually start an interaction, use these API calls: let uniqueIdentifier = NewRelic.startInteraction(withName: \"My Interaction\") Copy This call will automatically begin tracking an interaction trace named My Interaction from the current line. It will also complete any previously running interaction. It returns a unique identifier that can be used to complete that interaction by using this API call: NewRelic.stopCurrentInteraction(uniqueIdentifier) Copy This method will complete the interaction associated with the uniqueIdentifier if that interaction has not already completed automatically. You do not need to call this method. Rename a default Swift interaction By default, the iOS agent will start an interaction trace when a new view controller is displayed. The interactions are named using the format Display <ViewController>. To change these default names, implement the @objc func customNewRelicInteractionName() -> String method in your view controller, where the string returned becomes the interaction's name. Set a custom application version with Swift The New Relic iOS SDK allows you to set a custom application version string. Instead of using the string defined in CFBundleShortVersionString, call the NewRelic.setApplicationVersion() method, and pass along the custom application version before calling NewRelic.startWithApplicationToken();. NewRelic.setApplicationVersion(String appVersion) Copy Set a custom build identifier with Swift As of version 5.1.0 of the New Relic iOS SDK, an API method allows you to set a custom build identifier that is displayed next to the application version in the Crash details page. Instead of using the CFBundleVersion string defined in Xcode, call the NewRelic.setApplicationBuild() method, and pass along the custom build identifier.

For a general overview of mobile monitoring functionality, see Introduction to mobile monitoring. Compatibility and requirements Before you install the iOS agent, review the compatibility and requirements. Install the agent As part of the installation process, New Relic automatically generates an application token. This is a 40-character hexadecimal string for authenticating each mobile app that you monitor. There are two ways you can install the iOS agent: We recommend you install and configure the iOS agent using the CocoaPods installation method. You can also manually install and configure the iOS agent by adding the New Relic framework to your app. Extend your instrumentation After you install the agent, you can extend the agent's default instrumentation with various types of custom data: To access: In the mobile UI: In New Relic One dashboards: Custom data Create and record custom events, interaction traces, and attributes to add details to your existing data and traces. You can also query the custom events that you created in New Relic One dashboards and NRQL. Network requests Enable the MobileRequest event feature so you can perform a full network analysis. To further investigate network request error rates and response times, query MobileRequest and MobileRequestError events. Crash analysis Review detailed information using groups and filters to analyze trends that lead to crashes. To view more information about crashes, create NRQL queries to review Insights charts related to crash data. iOS SDK API Use the iOS SDK API to instrument parts of your code that are not instrumented by default. Then, view those custom events and attributes in New Relic Insights. Handled exceptions Report exceptions so you can identify factors creating a poor mobile app experience. To further improve performance, review MobileHandledException event records in New Relic Insights. Breadcrumbs Boost the level of detail in crash event trails by adding breadcrumbs. Then, query MobileBreadcrumbs events to see all breadcrumbs or just breadcrumbs related to crashes. Troubleshoot your installation If the agent isn't reporting data, try these troubleshooting suggestions.",

Foreground monitoring The iOS agent only monitors your app while it is in the foreground. The agent does not monitor background services while the app is closed. For more information, see our Mobile data privacy and security documentation. iOS requirements Make sure your iOS app meets these requirements: Component iOS application requirements Operating system iOS 9 or higher For Bitcode support, use SDK version 5.3.0 or higher. API/SDK NSURLConnection and AFNetworking are supported. NSURLSession supports upload and data tags only. ASIHttpRequest networking APIs are deprecated as of iOS agent version 5.8.2. Network traffic for UIWebView and WKWebView is supported. However, WKWebView Transfer size and Http errors are not supported. Languages Objective-C Swift: Works with both network traces and crash reporting, but no interaction traces by default. Interaction traces must be enabled for Swift. Devices Any iOS compatible device: iPhones, iPads, etc. File sizes The agent adds about 2 to 12 megabytes to your iOS release app, depending on platform build. Architectures ARM 64-bit. SHA-2 As a standard security measure for data collection, New Relic requires that your application server supports SHA-2 (256-bit). SHA-1 is not supported. Xcode To take advantage of New Relic's iOS features, make sure you have the latest version of Xcode. arm64e support To be able to properly symbolicate crashes from devices with arm64e architectures, make sure your Xcode settings are enabled for pointer authentication. For more information, see the Apple developer documentation. CocoaPods In order to use the latest XCFramework Agent, use CocoaPods version 1.10.1 or higher. Testing is not supported Our agents are designed and tested to work in a normal app lifecycle. New Relic does not support running any testing environment on applications with the agent. Testing can cause conflicts and unpredictable behavior. Potential method replacement conflicts Our iOS agent utilizes method replacement during run time. This may result in a conflict with other libraries that also implement method replacement, such as ReactiveCocoa, Firebase, Aspects, and AppleGuice.",

For a general overview of mobile monitoring functionality, see Introduction to mobile monitoring. Compatibility and requirements Before you install the iOS agent, review the compatibility and requirements. Install the agent As part of the installation process, New Relic automatically generates an application token. This is a 40-character hexadecimal string for authenticating each mobile app that you monitor. There are two ways you can install the iOS agent: We recommend you install and configure the iOS agent using the CocoaPods installation method. You can also manually install and configure the iOS agent by adding the New Relic framework to your app. Extend your instrumentation After you install the agent, you can extend the agent's default instrumentation with various types of custom data: To access: In the mobile UI: In New Relic One dashboards: Custom data Create and record custom events, interaction traces, and attributes to add details to your existing data and traces. You can also query the custom events that you created in New Relic One dashboards and NRQL. Network requests Enable the MobileRequest event feature so you can perform a full network analysis. To further investigate network request error rates and response times, query MobileRequest and MobileRequestError events. Crash analysis Review detailed information using groups and filters to analyze trends that lead to crashes. To view more information about crashes, create NRQL queries to review Insights charts related to crash data. iOS SDK API Use the iOS SDK API to instrument parts of your code that are not instrumented by default. Then, view those custom events and attributes in New Relic Insights. Handled exceptions Report exceptions so you can identify factors creating a poor mobile app experience. To further improve performance, review MobileHandledException event records in New Relic Insights. Breadcrumbs Boost the level of detail in crash event trails by adding breadcrumbs. Then, query MobileBreadcrumbs events to see all breadcrumbs or just breadcrumbs related to crashes. Troubleshoot your installation If the agent isn't reporting data, try these troubleshooting suggestions.",

Installing your tvOS application As part of the installation process, New Relic automatically generates an application token. This is a 40-character hexadecimal string for authenticating each mobile app you monitor. For Admins with existing New Relic accounts, follow these steps to install and configure your application. (If you don't have a New Relic account, signup at newrelic.com/signup—it's free, forever.) Go to one.newrelic.com and click Mobile. If applicable: From the Mobile Apps list, select Add a new app From the Get Started page, select tvOS as the platform for mobile monitoring. Type a name for your mobile app, and select Continue. Configuring your tvOS application These procedures to configure your tvOS app are also available on the Get Started page in the mobile monitoring UI. Download and unzip the tvOS SDK. To add the New Relic tvOS Mobile Framework to your Xcode project: Use Finder to drag the NewRelicAgentTVOS.framework folder into your Xcode project, and drop it onto your Project in the Project Navigator window. Follow the prompts to copy items into destination and to create folder references. Add the SystemConfiguration.framework, libc++.tbd, and libz.tbd libraries to your Linker settings. To start the agent: Import the tvOS agent header at the top of your prefix.pch. Add + [ NewRelic startWithApplicationToken: < appToken>] to the top of -application:didFinishLaunchingWithOptions: in your AppDelegate.m using the unique application token that is automatically generated. Add a build script to your target's Build Phases and paste the following, replacing PUT_NEW_RELIC_APP_TOKEN_HERE with your application token: SCRIPT=`/usr/bin/find \"${SRCROOT}\" -name newrelic_postbuild.sh | head -n 1` /bin/sh \"${SCRIPT}\" \"PUT_NEW_RELIC_APP_TOKEN_HERE\" Copy Clean and build your app, and then run it in the simulator or other device.

      "body": "NerdGraph is our GraphQL-format API that lets you query New Relic data and configure some New Relic features. After you sign up for a free New Relic account and install any of our monitoring services, you can get started with NerdGraph. What is NerdGraph? New Relic has several APIs. NerdGraph is the API we recommend for querying New Relic data and for performing some specific configurations (learn more about features). NerdGraph provides a single API interface for returning data from New Relic’s various APIs and microservices. Over time, other configuration capabilities will be added to NerdGraph. Important NerdGraph isn’t used for data ingest. For that, you'd use our data ingest APIs. NerdGraph is built using GraphQL, which is an open source API format that allows you to request exactly the data needed, with no over-fetching or under-fetching. For a lesson in how to use NerdGraph, watch this 7-minute video: Want to watch more video tutorials? Go to the New Relic University’s Intro to NerdGraph. Or see the online course on New Relic APIs. Use the GraphiQL explorer To get started using GraphQL, we recommend playing around with our GraphiQL explorer (GraphiQL is an open source graphical interface for using GraphQL). You can use it to explore our data schema, to read built-in object definitions, and to build and execute queries. To use GraphQL, you’ll need a user-specific New Relic API key called a user key. You can generate one or find an existing one from the GraphiQL explorer’s API key dropdown. To find the GraphiQL explorer: If your New Relic account uses an EU data center, go to api.eu.newrelic.com/graphiql. Otherwise use api.newrelic.com/graphiql. For tips on how to build queries, see Build queries. Requirements and endpoints To use NerdGraph, you need a New Relic user key, which can be generated and accessed from the GraphiQL explorer. The endpoints are: Main endpoint: https://api.newrelic.com/graphql Endpoint for accounts using EU data center: https://api.eu.newrelic.com/graphql To access the endpoint, use the following cURL command: curl -X POST https://api.newrelic.com/graphql \\ -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \\ -H 'API-Key: YOUR_NEW_RELIC_USER_KEY' \\ -d '{ \"query\": \"{ requestContext { userId apiKey } }\" } ' Copy What can you do with NerdGraph? NerdGraph functionality can be broken down into two main categories: Querying New Relic data. You can fetch data for a variety of purposes, including using it in a programmatic workflow, or building a New Relic One app for custom data visualizations. Configuring New Relic features. There are a variety of configurations available and more will be added over time. You can do things like add tags, configure workloads, or customize \"golden metrics.\" You can use NerdGraph to return a wide range of New Relic data but we’ve created some tutorials for common use cases: Topic Tutorials Your monitored entities Get data about entities Understand entity relationships and dependencies (used to build service maps) Query and configure \"golden metrics\" (important entity metrics) Querying data Query using NRQL (our query language) Tags Add and manage tags APM agents APM agent configuration Dashboards Create dashboards Export dashboards to other accounts Export dashboards as files Migrate from Insights Dashboard API to NerdGraph Alerts See all alert-related tutorials Applied Intelligence View and configure topology Workloads View and configure workloads Service Levels Configure and manage Service Levels Manage keys Create and manage keys (license keys used for data ingest, and user keys) Manage data Convert event data to metric data Drop data Distributed tracing Query distributed tracing data Configure Infinite Tracing New Relic One apps Build a New Relic One app Cloud integrations (AWS, Azure, GCP) Configure cloud integrations Partners and resellers Manage subscriptions (only for partners using original pricing model) Data partitions Manage data partitions Date retention Manage data retention NerdGraph terminology The following are terms that originate with GraphQL (the API format NerdGraph uses). Term Definition Queries and mutations There are two classes of GraphQL operations: Queries are basic requests used only to fetch data. These queries are not static, meaning that you can ask for more data or less data, depending on your needs. For each query, you can specify exactly what data you want to retrieve, as long as it is supported by the schema. Mutations are requests that perform an action, such as creating a resource or changing configuration. Mutations require the keyword mutation, as well as the name of the mutation. Type Data in GraphQL is organized into types. Types can be scalars (like strings, numbers, or booleans) or object types. An object type is a custom type made up of a collection of fields. For example, an object type called User may represent a user in a system. Field A field represents a piece of information on an object type that can be queried. Fields can be scalars, lists, or objects. For example, a User object type could have a string field called name. Interface An interface is an abstract type that represents a collection of common fields that other object types can implement. Tips on using the GraphiQL explorer You can make queries with the NerdGraph GraphiQL explorer. The explorer provides built-in schema definitions and features, including auto-complete and query validation. Query accounts a New Relic user can access You can query for the name of an account that an actor (a New Relic authorized user) has access to: query { actor { account(id: YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID) { name } } } Copy The response will mirror the query structure you defined in the request, making it easy to ask for the specific data that you want. { \"data\": { \"actor\": { \"account\": { \"name\": \"Data Nerd\" } } } } Copy Query user, account, and NRQL in one request The graph structure shows its capabilities when queries become more complex. For example, you can query for user information, account information, and make a NRQL query with one request. With REST API, this would take three different requests to three different endpoints. query { actor { account(id: YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID) { name nrql(query: \"SELECT * FROM Transaction\") { results } } user { name id } } } Copy",

No credit card required. Processor architectures The infrastructure agent supports these processor architectures: Linux: 64-bit for x86 processor architectures (also requires 64-bit package manager and dependencies) Windows: both 32 and 64-bit for x86 processor architectures ARM: arm64 architecture including AWS Graviton 2 processor is supported on compatible Linux operating sytems. On-host integrations are also supported (with the exception of the Oracle integration). macOS: 64-bit x86 processor (M1 processor is not supported yet). Operating systems The infrastructure agent supports these operating systems up to their manufacturer's end-of-life. Operating system Supported by the infrastructure agent Amazon Linux 2 All versions CentOS Version 7 or higher Debian Version 8 (\"Jessie\") or higher Docker Docker 1.12 Kubernetes Tested with versions 1.16 to 1.22 Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) Version 7 or higher Oracle Linux Version 7 or higher SUSE Linux Enterprise Server (SLES) Versions 11.4, 12.1, 12.2, 12.3, 12.4, 12.5, 15, 15.1, 15.2, 15.3 Ubuntu LTS versions 16.04.x, 18.04.x, 20.04.x Interim releases 20.10, 21.04. Windows Windows Server 2012, 2016, 2019, and 2022, and their service packs. Windows 10 and their service packs. macOS 10.15 (Catalina), 11 (Big Sur), 12 (Monterey). You can also monitor Amazon BottleRocket workloads: When running EC2 instances, use the containerized agent. On EKS, install the Kubernetes integration. For ECS clusters, deploy the ECS integration. Unique hostname The infrastructure agent uses the hostname to uniquely identify each server. To avoid inaccurate metrics from combining multiple servers under a single hostname, make sure that each monitored server has a unique hostname. You can use the optional display_name setting to override the default hostname. Servers named localhost are not reported because this is a default name and inherently non-unique. Permissions The infrastructure agent requires these permissions: Linux: By default, the agent runs and installs as root. You can also select privileged or unprivileged run modes. Windows: The agent must be installed from an Administrator account and requires Administrator privileges to run. macOS: The agent can be installed from any user account. Libraries For agent versions 1.1.19 or higher, you need the libcap library in order to install Infrastructure. It's available in the official repositories of your distribution. Network access In order to report data to New Relic, our infrastructure agent must have outbound access to certain domains and ports. If your system needs a proxy to connect to these domains, use the proxy setting. Container software The infrastructure agent instruments Docker containers when installed on the host server. We support Docker versions 1.12 or higher. CPU, memory, and disk usage The infrastructure agent is fairly lightweight. For typical CPU, memory, and disk usage, see our page on agent performance overhead. For more information on supported file systems, see Storage sample attributes. Configuration management tools The infrastructure agent can be deployed programmatically using several config management and deploy tools: Ansible Chef Elastic Beanstalk Puppet",

      "body": "In Grafana, you can configure New Relic as a Prometheus data source. Not only that, within Grafana you can query metrics stored in New Relic using the PromQL query language. Use existing Grafana dashboards with New Relic When you integrate Prometheus metrics with New Relic via Remote Write or the OpenMetrics Integration (2.0+) and configure New Relic as a Prometheus data source in Grafana, you can use existing Grafana dashboards and seamlessly tap into the additional monitoring, reliability, and scale we provide. Compatibility and requirements Before you begin, make sure you’ve finished integrating Prometheus metrics and are running a recent enough version of Grafana. You should have either the Remote Write or the OpenMetrics Integration ( v2.0+) set up before you can configure New Relic Prometheus data sources in Grafana. You can only configure New Relic Prometheus data sources using this method in Grafana versions 6.7.0 or newer. You will need to configure custom headers in the UI, and this isn’t possible with earlier versions. For details, see Configure New Relic as a Prometheus data source for Grafana. Support for PromQL Our Prometheus API emulates Prometheus' query APIs. We support the Prometheus query language (PromQL) through our PromQL-style query mode. We do our best to automatically translate PromQL syntax queries into the closest NRQL approximation. For more information on how this works and differences you may observe between Prometheus and New Relic, see Supported PromQL features. Get data flowing in Grafana To make your New Relic data available in Grafana, you can configure a new or existing Prometheus data source in just a couple of simple steps: In the Grafana UI, add and configure a new data source. Save the new data source and start viewing your data. What’s next? Ready to configure a Grafana data source?

This document explains how to activate this integration and describes the data that can be reported. Features This integration collects information from AWS CloudTrail, which captures and records AWS account activity, mainly for audit and governance purposes. New Relic's AWS CloudTrail integration collects events that represent errors and AWS console logins. Errors give you awareness about API calls and services that have failed, and console logins help you monitor console activity and potential intrusion attempts. Besides these two types of data, New Relic does not collect any other data. This is because other AWS CloudTrail data is already reported by New Relic in the form of inventory change events. Activate integration Important The AWS CloudTrail integration collects data from us-east-1 region only by default. To enable all AWS regions please contact us at support.newrelic.com. To enable this integration follow standard procedures to Connect AWS services to New Relic. Configuration and polling You can change the polling frequency and filter data using configuration options. Default polling information for the AWS CloudTrail integration: New Relic polling interval: 5 minutes Find and use data To find your integration data in Infrastructure, go to one.newrelic.com > Infrastructure > AWS and select one of the AWS CloudTrail integration links. This integration does not provide metric or inventory data: only event data. You can use Infrastructure's Events page to view a timeline of these events. You can query and explore your data using the InfrastructureEvent event type, with a provider value of CloudTrail. For general information about how to find and use integration data, see Understand integration data. Event attributes Here are attributes that can be reported with CloudTrail events: Metadata Description awsRegion The AWS region the request was made of. cloudTrailEventType Identifies the type of event that generated the event record. This can be the one of the following values: AwsApiCall, AwsServiceEvent, ConsoleSignin. errorCode The AWS service error (if the request returns an error). For a list of the most common errors, see the AWS CloudTrail documentation. errorMessage If the request returns an error, the description of the error. eventId The unique identifier of the event. eventName The requested action. eventSource The AWS service the request was made of. sourceIpAddress The IP address from which the request was made. userAgent The agent through which the request was made, such as the AWS Management Console, an AWS service, the AWS SDKs, or the AWS CLI. userName The user name or role name of the requester that called the API in the event returned. Query examples You can use New Relic to run queries of AWS CloudTrail data, and optionally use New Relic alerts to set alerts on that data. Query example: Count of failed API calls Query for a count of failed API calls, aggregated by the AWS service that the request was made to: SELECT count(*) from InfrastructureEvent WHERE provider = 'CloudTrail' AND cloudTrailEventType = 'AwsApiCall' FACET eventSource Copy Query example: Count of console login errors Query to find all console login errors: SELECT * from InfrastructureEvent WHERE provider = 'CloudTrail' AND cloudTrailEventType = 'AwsConsoleSignIn' AND errorMessage IS NOT NULL Copy",

It's free, forever. If you're just getting acquainted with OpenTelemetry, this is what we'll explore here: Benefits of OpenTelemetry Should I use OpenTelemetry or New Relic agents? How OpenTelemetry works with New Relic Benefits of OpenTelemetry OpenTelemetry provides a secure, vendor-neutral specification for service instrumentation so that you can export data to distinct backends of your choice, such as New Relic. OpenTelemetry offers a single set of APIs and libraries that standardize how you collect and transfer telemetry data for your services. The following components make up the OpenTelemetry project: Specifications for the core pillars of observability to drive consistency across all projects. New Relic supports all of these signals: traces, metrics, and logs (see details below) APIs that contain interfaces and implementations based on the specifications SDKs (reference implementations of the APIs) created specifically for languages like Java, Python, Go, Erlang, and more Collectors that offer a vendor-agnostic implementation for processing and exporting Exporters that enable you to send data to a backend of your choice The components of OpenTelemetry work together to create some distinct advantages for capturing telemetry data: Feature Description Ubiquitous instrumentation A single, open standard of instrumentation provides better coverage and flexibility as engineers from all over the world contribute to the instrumentation. Future proof As the instrumentation gets built into libraries and frameworks, and as more vendors move to support this open standard, you can be confident that you won’t need to change your instrumentation. Support for newer technologies When new technologies emerge, contributors can build integrations into OpenTelemetry or add instrumentation directly to source code, ensuring end users can easily monitor these new technologies. Simplified choice You don’t need to decide which instrumentation option to use (a proprietary option or one of the other open standards). Cross-platform compatibility OpenTelemetry supports a variety of languages and backends. It represents a vendor-neutral path for capturing and transmitting telemetry to backends without altering existing instrumentation. Streamlined observability It is easier for vendors to support and test against a single standard as they don’t need to develop their own agents or collectors. High dimensionality OpenTelemetry uses dimensional metrics, so you can filter and facet on more aspects of the data, such as AWS regions, Kubernetes clusters, or service versions. Dimensional metrics also lead to less time between occurrence and reporting. Should I use OpenTelemetry instrumentation or New Relic agents? As you consider OpenTelemetry, you may also be looking at New Relic APM agents that also capture telemetry data. As you'd expect, there is a lot of overlap between features available from OpenTelemetry agents and SDKs versus those available from New Relic APM agents. This is especially true if you're interested in distributed tracing telemetry data. The choice you make depends on what you need. We recommend that you explore both New Relic and OpenTelemetry instrumentation or discuss this with us in our CNCF Slack channel to decide what works best for you. OpenTelemetry: A work in progress OpenTelemetry is still an emerging standard, so your choices may be affected by what's available. You can check on the current state of the specification at the OpenTelemetry site. The current state of language-specific OpenTelemetry APIs and SDKs varies: some languages are still pre-alpha and may be missing instructions on how to instrument your service. Most languages have some implementation of traces that is sufficient to start exporting data to New Relic. Check out this table in GitHub that provides an overview of the state of OpenTelemetry specification compliance for each language. For languages that New Relic does not currently provide an agent or SDK, OpenTelemetry may offer you a good alternative. Also, in cases where you want explicit control over sampling of your telemetry data, OpenTelemetry provides a lot of flexibility. As OpenTelemetry matures, New Relic will continue to support new OpenTelemetry data models and to provide a curated UI experience for our customers. New Relic's APM agents In general, New Relic's APM agents will collect more telemetry data for your services, and they offer a wide range of configuration options and an extensive set of auto-instrumentation capabilities. New Relic's APM agents offer detailed transaction trace visibility for individual services. They also offer predefined sampling to balance the performance impact of your instrumentation against the need to capture enough data to gain helpful insights. How OpenTelemetry works with New Relic New Relic supports the native OpenTelemetry Protocol (OTLP) for exporting telemetry data. This allows you to use the vendor neutral components developed by the OpenTelemetry community to export your data to New Relic. The following tables show the supported features for each telemetry signal. If you have questions about these or have an unsupported use case, please contact us in our CNCF Slack channel, and watch this page for future updates. Important New Relic's exporters for OpenTelemetry are now deprecated in favor of exporting data to New Relic using OTLP. Traces New Relic offers support for the OTLP ingest of trace signals. The maturity of the upstream specification is stable. OpenTelemetry traces and spans are compatible with New Relic traces and spans. OpenTelemetry spans optionally include attributes (name-value pairs) and resource attributes which map directly to dimensions that can be used to facet or filter span data at query time. OpenTelemetry span metadata (for example, name, kind, and trace_id) also map directly to dimensions on NewRelic spans. At this time, New Relic does not support span links or array attributes. For details, see the Traces section of our best practices guide. Feature Supported Span events ✅ Span linking ❌ Array of primitives (homogeneous) ❌ Metrics New Relic offers support for the OTLP ingest of metric signals. Note that the maturity of the upstream specification is experimental. We intend to follow potentially breaking upstream changes. Here are the OpenTelemetry data types we support and their associated mappings. For details, see the Metrics section of our best practices guide. Metric Type Supported Delta sums ✅ Cumulative sums ✅ Gauges ✅ Delta histograms ✅ Summary ✅ Cumulative histograms ❌ Exemplars ❌ Array of primitives (homogeneous) ❌ Logs New Relic offers support for the OTLP ingest of log signals. Note that the maturity of the upstream specification is experimental. We intend to follow potentially breaking upstream changes. OpenTelemetry logs are compatible with New Relic logs. OpenTelemetry logs optionally include attributes (name-value pairs) and resource attributes which map directly to dimensions that can be used to facet or filter log data at query time. OpenTelemetry log metadata (for example, name, severity_text, and trace_id) also map directly to dimensions on New Relic logs. NewRelic currently supports all OpenTelemetry log message types except for arrays. For more details, see the Logs section of our best practices guide. Feature Supported Description LogRecord body ✅ Supported types: string, boolean, int, double, bytes LogRecord attributes ✅ Supported types: string, boolean, int, double, bytes LogRecord fields ✅ Examples: name, severity_text, trace_id Array messages ❌ Array attributes ❌ Next steps Follow the OpenTelemetry quick start to help you get started. You'll also want to review the best practices guide for getting the most out of the data you export to New Relic.",

      "body": "Troubleshooting OpenTelemetry with New Relic may just be a matter of making sure you are following best practices, but sometimes you may need to take additional steps to diagnose your issues. Here are some examples of specific problems you might encounter, along with steps and tools to resolve them. OpenTelemetry data sent via OTLP is not queryable Problem You sent OpenTelemetry metrics, logs, or traces using OTLP and are unable to view the data. Before digging deeper, make sure you've checked the following: The OTLP endpoint configured matches one of our documented endpoints, is properly formatted, and includes the official default port, 4317. Sending OTLP data via port 443 is not supported at this time. Please note the specific endpoint for FedRAMP compliance, if applicable. The outbound traffic is not restricted by a firewall. Our Networks document explains domains and network blocks that you may need to explicitly allow. The client is configured to use TLS 1.2 or higher and the request includes the api-key header with a valid New Relic account (ingest) license key. Requests include valid protobuf payloads and use gRPC and HTTP/2 transport, preferably with gzip compression enabled. Sending protobuf or JSON-encoded payloads over HTTP/1.1 is not supported at this time. Client output and logs do not indicate 4xx or 5xx response codes are being returned. Solution There are number of tools you can use to validate the successful delivery of telemetry data to our platform. A good first step is to check the data management hub to facet data ingest and determine how much data is arriving from various sources. You can also use the data explorer or query builder to look for data faceted by instrumentation.provider or newrelic.source attributes: FROM Log, Metric, Span SELECT datapointcount() WHERE instrumentation.provider = 'opentelemetry' FACET instrumentation.provider, newrelic.source Copy This query should tell you whether data is arriving via OTLP. If the data you expect is not present, try removing the WHERE clause or checking for integration errors. Querying NrIntegrationError events can help you determine whether you have configuration or format issues or if you've run into our platform limits. Important The ingest limits for metrics, logs, and traces via OTLP are the same as our other data ingest API limits. Various parts of the New Relic UI rely on the presence of specific attributes to function properly. You can use the NRQL console feature in many places to check the WHERE or FACET clauses of the query for required attributes. You can also edit those clauses and re-run the query to determine whether there is data present with those attributes missing. Examples of required attributes include service.name and service.instance.id. For a more complete list of examples, see resources. OpenTelemetry entities or relationships are missing Problem You sent OpenTelemetry data from a service or infrastructure component and either the entity or its relationships are missing or incorrect. Solution OpenTelemetry entities will be synthesized based on the public rules described for the EXT-SERVICE entity type. The standard rule to match relies on the presence of the service.name dimension which follows the OpenTelemetry semantic conventions. To set the service.name with the OpenTelemetry Java SDK, include it in your resource: var resource = Resource.getDefault() .merge(Resource.builder().put(SERVICE_NAME, serviceName).build()); Copy Depending on the SDK, you may also set the service.name by declaring it in the OTEL_RESOURCE_ATTRIBUTES or OTEL_SERVICE_NAME environment variables. For Logs, you can use a structured log template to inject the service.name. Here are some log examples: Setting the service name Logs in context with Log4j2 Tip For more OpenTelemetry examples with New Relic, visit the newrelic-opentelemetry-examples repository on GitHub.",

Depending on the language agent, available settings may include: Transaction tracing SQL recording and logging SQL query plans Error collection Thread profiling Distributed tracing Cross application tracing Requirements Server-side configuration is not available for our C SDK agent or our PHP agent. Centralization and security Server-side configuration provides an easy way to manage the available settings from the New Relic server side. Centralized configuration settings can also help you ensure standards compliance and security management for your settings. Any change to a monitored application automatically applies to all APM agents monitoring that application, even if they run across multiple hosts. The agent still follows the local configurations for any settings that can't be set . Server-side configuration precedence This feature provides the convenience of managing the available configuration settings directly from the New Relic side, without the need for deployments or restarts. Available options to change settings, and the order of precedence they take when you use environment variables or other configuration options, will depend on the language agent used. For more information about the hierarchy of settings, see the illustration for the specific agent: C SDK configuration: A hierarchy is not applicable, because configuration values come from API calls. Also, server-side configuration is not supported. However, you can change the app name from the UI or from the C SDK configuration settings. Go hierarchy Java hierarchy .NET hierarchy Node.js hierarchy PHP hierarchy (server-side configuration not supported) Python hierarchy Ruby hierarchy Configure from the UI The C SDK and PHP agent do not support server-side configuration. To enable server-side configuration settings for monitored apps from the UI: Go to one.newrelic.com and click APM. Click on your app. Then click Settings > Application > Server-side agent configuration. After you enable server-side configuration, you can view and change the available settings through the UI. Configure from NerdGraph API For how to enable this with NerdGraph, see the NerdGraph tutorial. View or change server-side configuration settings If you use server-side configuration, you must still include your license_key and app_name in the local config file. These settings are required for the agent to communicate with the New Relic collector. The C SDK and PHP agent do not support server-side configuration. To view or change the available server-side configuration settings through the UI for apps that use other New Relic agents: Go to one.newrelic.com and click APM. Click on your app. Then click Settings > Application > Server-side agent configuration. Once you set any of these options from the UI, they will override any conflicting options in the agent's configuration file. Disable server-side configuration Once you enable server-side configuration for an account, server-side configuration cannot be turned off without assistance from New Relic Support. This helps mitigate issues that could arise from conflicts with configuration settings if you need to transition back to a local configuration setup.",

It's free, forever. If you're just getting acquainted with OpenTelemetry, this is what we'll explore here: Benefits of OpenTelemetry Should I use OpenTelemetry or New Relic agents? How OpenTelemetry works with New Relic Benefits of OpenTelemetry OpenTelemetry provides a secure, vendor-neutral specification for service instrumentation so that you can export data to distinct backends of your choice, such as New Relic. OpenTelemetry offers a single set of APIs and libraries that standardize how you collect and transfer telemetry data for your services. The following components make up the OpenTelemetry project: Specifications for the core pillars of observability to drive consistency across all projects. New Relic supports all of these signals: traces, metrics, and logs (see details below) APIs that contain interfaces and implementations based on the specifications SDKs (reference implementations of the APIs) created specifically for languages like Java, Python, Go, Erlang, and more Collectors that offer a vendor-agnostic implementation for processing and exporting Exporters that enable you to send data to a backend of your choice The components of OpenTelemetry work together to create some distinct advantages for capturing telemetry data: Feature Description Ubiquitous instrumentation A single, open standard of instrumentation provides better coverage and flexibility as engineers from all over the world contribute to the instrumentation. Future proof As the instrumentation gets built into libraries and frameworks, and as more vendors move to support this open standard, you can be confident that you won’t need to change your instrumentation. Support for newer technologies When new technologies emerge, contributors can build integrations into OpenTelemetry or add instrumentation directly to source code, ensuring end users can easily monitor these new technologies. Simplified choice You don’t need to decide which instrumentation option to use (a proprietary option or one of the other open standards). Cross-platform compatibility OpenTelemetry supports a variety of languages and backends. It represents a vendor-neutral path for capturing and transmitting telemetry to backends without altering existing instrumentation. Streamlined observability It is easier for vendors to support and test against a single standard as they don’t need to develop their own agents or collectors. High dimensionality OpenTelemetry uses dimensional metrics, so you can filter and facet on more aspects of the data, such as AWS regions, Kubernetes clusters, or service versions. Dimensional metrics also lead to less time between occurrence and reporting. Should I use OpenTelemetry instrumentation or New Relic agents? As you consider OpenTelemetry, you may also be looking at New Relic APM agents that also capture telemetry data. As you'd expect, there is a lot of overlap between features available from OpenTelemetry agents and SDKs versus those available from New Relic APM agents. This is especially true if you're interested in distributed tracing telemetry data. The choice you make depends on what you need. We recommend that you explore both New Relic and OpenTelemetry instrumentation or discuss this with us in our CNCF Slack channel to decide what works best for you. OpenTelemetry: A work in progress OpenTelemetry is still an emerging standard, so your choices may be affected by what's available. You can check on the current state of the specification at the OpenTelemetry site. The current state of language-specific OpenTelemetry APIs and SDKs varies: some languages are still pre-alpha and may be missing instructions on how to instrument your service. Most languages have some implementation of traces that is sufficient to start exporting data to New Relic. Check out this table in GitHub that provides an overview of the state of OpenTelemetry specification compliance for each language. For languages that New Relic does not currently provide an agent or SDK, OpenTelemetry may offer you a good alternative. Also, in cases where you want explicit control over sampling of your telemetry data, OpenTelemetry provides a lot of flexibility. As OpenTelemetry matures, New Relic will continue to support new OpenTelemetry data models and to provide a curated UI experience for our customers. New Relic's APM agents In general, New Relic's APM agents will collect more telemetry data for your services, and they offer a wide range of configuration options and an extensive set of auto-instrumentation capabilities. New Relic's APM agents offer detailed transaction trace visibility for individual services. They also offer predefined sampling to balance the performance impact of your instrumentation against the need to capture enough data to gain helpful insights. How OpenTelemetry works with New Relic New Relic supports the native OpenTelemetry Protocol (OTLP) for exporting telemetry data. This allows you to use the vendor neutral components developed by the OpenTelemetry community to export your data to New Relic. The following tables show the supported features for each telemetry signal. If you have questions about these or have an unsupported use case, please contact us in our CNCF Slack channel, and watch this page for future updates. Important New Relic's exporters for OpenTelemetry are now deprecated in favor of exporting data to New Relic using OTLP. Traces New Relic offers support for the OTLP ingest of trace signals. The maturity of the upstream specification is stable. OpenTelemetry traces and spans are compatible with New Relic traces and spans. OpenTelemetry spans optionally include attributes (name-value pairs) and resource attributes which map directly to dimensions that can be used to facet or filter span data at query time. OpenTelemetry span metadata (for example, name, kind, and trace_id) also map directly to dimensions on NewRelic spans. At this time, New Relic does not support span links or array attributes. For details, see the Traces section of our best practices guide. Feature Supported Span events ✅ Span linking ❌ Array of primitives (homogeneous) ❌ Metrics New Relic offers support for the OTLP ingest of metric signals. Note that the maturity of the upstream specification is experimental. We intend to follow potentially breaking upstream changes. Here are the OpenTelemetry data types we support and their associated mappings. For details, see the Metrics section of our best practices guide. Metric Type Supported Delta sums ✅ Cumulative sums ✅ Gauges ✅ Delta histograms ✅ Summary ✅ Cumulative histograms ❌ Exemplars ❌ Array of primitives (homogeneous) ❌ Logs New Relic offers support for the OTLP ingest of log signals. Note that the maturity of the upstream specification is experimental. We intend to follow potentially breaking upstream changes. OpenTelemetry logs are compatible with New Relic logs. OpenTelemetry logs optionally include attributes (name-value pairs) and resource attributes which map directly to dimensions that can be used to facet or filter log data at query time. OpenTelemetry log metadata (for example, name, severity_text, and trace_id) also map directly to dimensions on New Relic logs. NewRelic currently supports all OpenTelemetry log message types except for arrays. For more details, see the Logs section of our best practices guide. Feature Supported Description LogRecord body ✅ Supported types: string, boolean, int, double, bytes LogRecord attributes ✅ Supported types: string, boolean, int, double, bytes LogRecord fields ✅ Examples: name, severity_text, trace_id Array messages ❌ Array attributes ❌ Next steps Follow the OpenTelemetry quick start to help you get started. You'll also want to review the best practices guide for getting the most out of the data you export to New Relic.",

      "body": "Troubleshooting OpenTelemetry with New Relic may just be a matter of making sure you are following best practices, but sometimes you may need to take additional steps to diagnose your issues. Here are some examples of specific problems you might encounter, along with steps and tools to resolve them. OpenTelemetry data sent via OTLP is not queryable Problem You sent OpenTelemetry metrics, logs, or traces using OTLP and are unable to view the data. Before digging deeper, make sure you've checked the following: The OTLP endpoint configured matches one of our documented endpoints, is properly formatted, and includes the official default port, 4317. Sending OTLP data via port 443 is not supported at this time. Please note the specific endpoint for FedRAMP compliance, if applicable. The outbound traffic is not restricted by a firewall. Our Networks document explains domains and network blocks that you may need to explicitly allow. The client is configured to use TLS 1.2 or higher and the request includes the api-key header with a valid New Relic account (ingest) license key. Requests include valid protobuf payloads and use gRPC and HTTP/2 transport, preferably with gzip compression enabled. Sending protobuf or JSON-encoded payloads over HTTP/1.1 is not supported at this time. Client output and logs do not indicate 4xx or 5xx response codes are being returned. Solution There are number of tools you can use to validate the successful delivery of telemetry data to our platform. A good first step is to check the data management hub to facet data ingest and determine how much data is arriving from various sources. You can also use the data explorer or query builder to look for data faceted by instrumentation.provider or newrelic.source attributes: FROM Log, Metric, Span SELECT datapointcount() WHERE instrumentation.provider = 'opentelemetry' FACET instrumentation.provider, newrelic.source Copy This query should tell you whether data is arriving via OTLP. If the data you expect is not present, try removing the WHERE clause or checking for integration errors. Querying NrIntegrationError events can help you determine whether you have configuration or format issues or if you've run into our platform limits. Important The ingest limits for metrics, logs, and traces via OTLP are the same as our other data ingest API limits. Various parts of the New Relic UI rely on the presence of specific attributes to function properly. You can use the NRQL console feature in many places to check the WHERE or FACET clauses of the query for required attributes. You can also edit those clauses and re-run the query to determine whether there is data present with those attributes missing. Examples of required attributes include service.name and service.instance.id. For a more complete list of examples, see resources. OpenTelemetry entities or relationships are missing Problem You sent OpenTelemetry data from a service or infrastructure component and either the entity or its relationships are missing or incorrect. Solution OpenTelemetry entities will be synthesized based on the public rules described for the EXT-SERVICE entity type. The standard rule to match relies on the presence of the service.name dimension which follows the OpenTelemetry semantic conventions. To set the service.name with the OpenTelemetry Java SDK, include it in your resource: var resource = Resource.getDefault() .merge(Resource.builder().put(SERVICE_NAME, serviceName).build()); Copy Depending on the SDK, you may also set the service.name by declaring it in the OTEL_RESOURCE_ATTRIBUTES or OTEL_SERVICE_NAME environment variables. For Logs, you can use a structured log template to inject the service.name. Here are some log examples: Setting the service name Logs in context with Log4j2 Tip For more OpenTelemetry examples with New Relic, visit the newrelic-opentelemetry-examples repository on GitHub.",

How OpenTelemetry works with New Relic Benefits of OpenTelemetry OpenTelemetry provides a secure, vendor-neutral specification for service instrumentation so that you can export data to distinct backends of your choice, such as New Relic. OpenTelemetry offers a single set of APIs and libraries that standardize how you collect and transfer telemetry data for your services. The following components make up the OpenTelemetry project: Specifications for the core pillars of observability to drive consistency across all projects. New Relic supports all of these signals: traces, metrics, and logs (see details below) APIs that contain interfaces and implementations based on the specifications SDKs (reference implementations of the APIs) created specifically for languages like Java, Python, Go, Erlang, and more Collectors that offer a vendor-agnostic implementation for processing and exporting Exporters that enable you to send data to a backend of your choice The components of OpenTelemetry work together to create some distinct advantages for capturing telemetry data: Feature Description Ubiquitous instrumentation A single, open standard of instrumentation provides better coverage and flexibility as engineers from all over the world contribute to the instrumentation. Future proof As the instrumentation gets built into libraries and frameworks, and as more vendors move to support this open standard, you can be confident that you won’t need to change your instrumentation. Support for newer technologies When new technologies emerge, contributors can build integrations into OpenTelemetry or add instrumentation directly to source code, ensuring end users can easily monitor these new technologies. Simplified choice You don’t need to decide which instrumentation option to use (a proprietary option or one of the other open standards). Cross-platform compatibility OpenTelemetry supports a variety of languages and backends. It represents a vendor-neutral path for capturing and transmitting telemetry to backends without altering existing instrumentation. Streamlined observability It is easier for vendors to support and test against a single standard as they don’t need to develop their own agents or collectors. High dimensionality OpenTelemetry uses dimensional metrics, so you can filter and facet on more aspects of the data, such as AWS regions, Kubernetes clusters, or service versions. Dimensional metrics also lead to less time between occurrence and reporting. Should I use OpenTelemetry instrumentation or New Relic agents? As you consider OpenTelemetry, you may also be looking at New Relic APM agents that also capture telemetry data. As you'd expect, there is a lot of overlap between features available from OpenTelemetry agents and SDKs versus those available from New Relic APM agents. This is especially true if you're interested in distributed tracing telemetry data. The choice you make depends on what you need. We recommend that you explore both New Relic and OpenTelemetry instrumentation or discuss this with us in our CNCF Slack channel to decide what works best for you. OpenTelemetry: A work in progress OpenTelemetry is still an emerging standard, so your choices may be affected by what's available. You can check on the current state of the specification at the OpenTelemetry site. The current state of language-specific OpenTelemetry APIs and SDKs varies: some languages are still pre-alpha and may be missing instructions on how to instrument your service. Most languages have some implementation of traces that is sufficient to start exporting data to New Relic. Check out this table in GitHub that provides an overview of the state of OpenTelemetry specification compliance for each language. For languages that New Relic does not currently provide an agent or SDK, OpenTelemetry may offer you a good alternative. Also, in cases where you want explicit control over sampling of your telemetry data, OpenTelemetry provides a lot of flexibility. As OpenTelemetry matures, New Relic will continue to support new OpenTelemetry data models and to provide a curated UI experience for our customers. New Relic's APM agents In general, New Relic's APM agents will collect more telemetry data for your services, and they offer a wide range of configuration options and an extensive set of auto-instrumentation capabilities. New Relic's APM agents offer detailed transaction trace visibility for individual services. They also offer predefined sampling to balance the performance impact of your instrumentation against the need to capture enough data to gain helpful insights. How OpenTelemetry works with New Relic New Relic supports the native OpenTelemetry Protocol (OTLP) for exporting telemetry data. This allows you to use the vendor neutral components developed by the OpenTelemetry community to export your data to New Relic. The following tables show the supported features for each telemetry signal. If you have questions about these or have an unsupported use case, please contact us in our CNCF Slack channel, and watch this page for future updates. Important New Relic's exporters for OpenTelemetry are now deprecated in favor of exporting data to New Relic using OTLP. Traces New Relic offers support for the OTLP ingest of trace signals. The maturity of the upstream specification is stable. OpenTelemetry traces and spans are compatible with New Relic traces and spans. OpenTelemetry spans optionally include attributes (name-value pairs) and resource attributes which map directly to dimensions that can be used to facet or filter span data at query time. OpenTelemetry span metadata (for example, name, kind, and trace_id) also map directly to dimensions on NewRelic spans. At this time, New Relic does not support span links or array attributes. For details, see the Traces section of our best practices guide. Feature Supported Span events ✅ Span linking ❌ Array of primitives (homogeneous) ❌ Metrics New Relic offers support for the OTLP ingest of metric signals. Note that the maturity of the upstream specification is experimental. We intend to follow potentially breaking upstream changes. Here are the OpenTelemetry data types we support and their associated mappings. For details, see the Metrics section of our best practices guide. Metric Type Supported Delta sums ✅ Cumulative sums ✅ Gauges ✅ Delta histograms ✅ Summary ✅ Cumulative histograms ❌ Exemplars ❌ Array of primitives (homogeneous) ❌ Logs New Relic offers support for the OTLP ingest of log signals. Note that the maturity of the upstream specification is experimental. We intend to follow potentially breaking upstream changes. OpenTelemetry logs are compatible with New Relic logs. OpenTelemetry logs optionally include attributes (name-value pairs) and resource attributes which map directly to dimensions that can be used to facet or filter log data at query time. OpenTelemetry log metadata (for example, name, severity_text, and trace_id) also map directly to dimensions on New Relic logs. NewRelic currently supports all OpenTelemetry log message types except for arrays. For more details, see the Logs section of our best practices guide. Feature Supported Description LogRecord body ✅ Supported types: string, boolean, int, double, bytes LogRecord attributes ✅ Supported types: string, boolean, int, double, bytes LogRecord fields ✅ Examples: name, severity_text, trace_id Array messages ❌ Array attributes ❌ Next steps Follow the OpenTelemetry quick start to help you get started. You'll also want to review the best practices guide for getting the most out of the data you export to New Relic.",

      "body": "Troubleshooting OpenTelemetry with New Relic may just be a matter of making sure you are following best practices, but sometimes you may need to take additional steps to diagnose your issues. Here are some examples of specific problems you might encounter, along with steps and tools to resolve them. OpenTelemetry data sent via OTLP is not queryable Problem You sent OpenTelemetry metrics, logs, or traces using OTLP and are unable to view the data. Before digging deeper, make sure you've checked the following: The OTLP endpoint configured matches one of our documented endpoints, is properly formatted, and includes the official default port, 4317. Sending OTLP data via port 443 is not supported at this time. Please note the specific endpoint for FedRAMP compliance, if applicable. The outbound traffic is not restricted by a firewall. Our Networks document explains domains and network blocks that you may need to explicitly allow. The client is configured to use TLS 1.2 or higher and the request includes the api-key header with a valid New Relic account (ingest) license key. Requests include valid protobuf payloads and use gRPC and HTTP/2 transport, preferably with gzip compression enabled. Sending protobuf or JSON-encoded payloads over HTTP/1.1 is not supported at this time. Client output and logs do not indicate 4xx or 5xx response codes are being returned. Solution There are number of tools you can use to validate the successful delivery of telemetry data to our platform. A good first step is to check the data management hub to facet data ingest and determine how much data is arriving from various sources. You can also use the data explorer or query builder to look for data faceted by instrumentation.provider or newrelic.source attributes: FROM Log, Metric, Span SELECT datapointcount() WHERE instrumentation.provider = 'opentelemetry' FACET instrumentation.provider, newrelic.source Copy This query should tell you whether data is arriving via OTLP. If the data you expect is not present, try removing the WHERE clause or checking for integration errors. Querying NrIntegrationError events can help you determine whether you have configuration or format issues or if you've run into our platform limits. Important The ingest limits for metrics, logs, and traces via OTLP are the same as our other data ingest API limits. Various parts of the New Relic UI rely on the presence of specific attributes to function properly. You can use the NRQL console feature in many places to check the WHERE or FACET clauses of the query for required attributes. You can also edit those clauses and re-run the query to determine whether there is data present with those attributes missing. Examples of required attributes include service.name and service.instance.id. For a more complete list of examples, see resources. OpenTelemetry entities or relationships are missing Problem You sent OpenTelemetry data from a service or infrastructure component and either the entity or its relationships are missing or incorrect. Solution OpenTelemetry entities will be synthesized based on the public rules described for the EXT-SERVICE entity type. The standard rule to match relies on the presence of the service.name dimension which follows the OpenTelemetry semantic conventions. To set the service.name with the OpenTelemetry Java SDK, include it in your resource: var resource = Resource.getDefault() .merge(Resource.builder().put(SERVICE_NAME, serviceName).build()); Copy Depending on the SDK, you may also set the service.name by declaring it in the OTEL_RESOURCE_ATTRIBUTES or OTEL_SERVICE_NAME environment variables. For Logs, you can use a structured log template to inject the service.name. Here are some log examples: Setting the service name Logs in context with Log4j2 Tip For more OpenTelemetry examples with New Relic, visit the newrelic-opentelemetry-examples repository on GitHub.",

Here's an overview of the process, followed by details for each step. Prerequisites Instrument your service with OpenTelemetry Export your telemetry data to New Relic View your data in the New Relic UI Step 1. Prerequisites First things first: If we don’t already know you, sign up for a free New Relic account. Copy your account license key. Step 2. Instrument your service with OpenTelemetry To get started, you instrument your service with OpenTelemetry. OpenTelemetry has language-specific products and SDKs to help you. Many languages offer out-the-box instrumentation for common libraries and frameworks. Each language also provides an API for further instrumenting your service manually. Go to the repository for your language and follow the instructions to instrument your service. When you're done, return here to complete Step 3. Export your telemetry data to New Relic. C++ Erlang Go Java Javascript/Node.js .NET PHP Python Ruby Rust Swift ...See a complete list of languages in GitHub Step 3. Export your telemetry data to New Relic The OpenTelemetry Protocol, or OTLP for short, is a general purpose telemetry data delivery protocol designed for the OpenTelemetry project. This protocol describes how to encode and transmit telemetry data, which makes it a natural choice for data transport. Each language SDK provides an OTLP exporter you can configure to export data over OTLP. In this step, we focus on how to configure an OTLP exporter in your service to export data directly to New Relic. If you prefer to export your data first to an OpenTelemetry collector, we have separate instructions. Here's an example of sending data from your service directly to New Relic. To complete this third step, first familiarize yourself with some required New Relic settings, and then complete the steps in the OTLP exporter documentation for your language. Review New Relic settings for exports Before you go to the external OTLP exporter documentation, consult the table below so you're ready to do the following: Configure the OTLP exporter to add a header (api-key) whose value is the license key for the New Relic account you want to send data to. Based on your region, configure the endpoint where the exporter sends data to New Relic. Region gRPC HTTP/1.1 Endpoint API header name API header value TLS encryption required US ✅ ❌ https://otlp.nr-data.net:4317 api-key License key ✅ EU ✅ ❌ https://otlp.eu01.nr-data.net:4317 api-key License key ✅ Important If you have FedRamp compliance constraints, you will need to use https://gov-otlp.nr-data.net:4317. Please see FedRAMP-compliant endpoints for further information. Important In Node.js, the opentelemetry-collector-grpc library requires additional options to enable TLS. Complete the export configuration steps Click on the link below for your language and complete the configuration steps. When you're done, return here to complete Step 4. View your data in the New Relic UI. C++ Erlang Go Java Javascript/Node.js .NET PHP Python Ruby Rust Swift ...Find additional OTLP language support in GitHub Export data to an OpenTelemetry Collector (optional) The OpenTelemetry Collector is a configurable and extensible software component to receive, process, and export telemetry data. When you set up a collector, it can operate as a gateway or as an agent: Gateway: The collector receives data from a variety of sources and applies standard processing before exporting to some backend. Agent: The collector is deployed on each host in an environment and can collect telemetry data about the host and processes running on it. When you use a collector, you start by following the same routine as above for setting up OTLP in your service. In this case, instead of exporting data directly to New Relic, you export through a collector that you set up. In the collector, you configure the OTLP exporter to export data to New Relic. When your data goes through a collector, the transport looks like this: Here's a Docker example of how to set up and run an OpenTelemetry collector with the collector YAML: Save the following as otel-config.yaml: receivers: otlp: protocols: grpc: http: processors: batch: exporters: otlp: endpoint: ${OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_ENDPOINT} headers: api-key: ${NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY} service: pipelines: traces: receivers: [otlp] processors: [batch] exporters: [otlp] metrics: receivers: [otlp] processors: [batch] exporters: [otlp] logs: receivers: [otlp] processors: [batch] exporters: [otlp] Copy Run the OpenTelemetry collector, making sure you replace OTLP_ENDPOINT_HERE with the appropriate endpoint and replace YOUR_KEY_HERE with your account's license key: export OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_ENDPOINT=OTLP_ENDPOINT_HERE export NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY=YOUR_KEY_HERE docker run --rm \\ -e OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_ENDPOINT \\ -e NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY \\ -p 4317:4317 \\ -v \"${PWD}/otel-config.yaml\":/otel-config.yaml \\ --config otel-config.yaml \\ --name otelcol \\ otel/opentelemetry-collector Copy Step 4. View your data in the New Relic UI Once you’ve instrumented your service and configured it to export its data to New Relic, watch the New Relic One user interface for your traces, metrics, and logs!

      "body": "Troubleshooting OpenTelemetry with New Relic may just be a matter of making sure you are following best practices, but sometimes you may need to take additional steps to diagnose your issues. Here are some examples of specific problems you might encounter, along with steps and tools to resolve them. OpenTelemetry data sent via OTLP is not queryable Problem You sent OpenTelemetry metrics, logs, or traces using OTLP and are unable to view the data. Before digging deeper, make sure you've checked the following: The OTLP endpoint configured matches one of our documented endpoints, is properly formatted, and includes the official default port, 4317. Sending OTLP data via port 443 is not supported at this time. Please note the specific endpoint for FedRAMP compliance, if applicable. The outbound traffic is not restricted by a firewall. Our Networks document explains domains and network blocks that you may need to explicitly allow. The client is configured to use TLS 1.2 or higher and the request includes the api-key header with a valid New Relic account (ingest) license key. Requests include valid protobuf payloads and use gRPC and HTTP/2 transport, preferably with gzip compression enabled. Sending protobuf or JSON-encoded payloads over HTTP/1.1 is not supported at this time. Client output and logs do not indicate 4xx or 5xx response codes are being returned. Solution There are number of tools you can use to validate the successful delivery of telemetry data to our platform. A good first step is to check the data management hub to facet data ingest and determine how much data is arriving from various sources. You can also use the data explorer or query builder to look for data faceted by instrumentation.provider or newrelic.source attributes: FROM Log, Metric, Span SELECT datapointcount() WHERE instrumentation.provider = 'opentelemetry' FACET instrumentation.provider, newrelic.source Copy This query should tell you whether data is arriving via OTLP. If the data you expect is not present, try removing the WHERE clause or checking for integration errors. Querying NrIntegrationError events can help you determine whether you have configuration or format issues or if you've run into our platform limits. Important The ingest limits for metrics, logs, and traces via OTLP are the same as our other data ingest API limits. Various parts of the New Relic UI rely on the presence of specific attributes to function properly. You can use the NRQL console feature in many places to check the WHERE or FACET clauses of the query for required attributes. You can also edit those clauses and re-run the query to determine whether there is data present with those attributes missing. Examples of required attributes include service.name and service.instance.id. For a more complete list of examples, see resources. OpenTelemetry entities or relationships are missing Problem You sent OpenTelemetry data from a service or infrastructure component and either the entity or its relationships are missing or incorrect. Solution OpenTelemetry entities will be synthesized based on the public rules described for the EXT-SERVICE entity type. The standard rule to match relies on the presence of the service.name dimension which follows the OpenTelemetry semantic conventions. To set the service.name with the OpenTelemetry Java SDK, include it in your resource: var resource = Resource.getDefault() .merge(Resource.builder().put(SERVICE_NAME, serviceName).build()); Copy Depending on the SDK, you may also set the service.name by declaring it in the OTEL_RESOURCE_ATTRIBUTES or OTEL_SERVICE_NAME environment variables. For Logs, you can use a structured log template to inject the service.name. Here are some log examples: Setting the service name Logs in context with Log4j2 Tip For more OpenTelemetry examples with New Relic, visit the newrelic-opentelemetry-examples repository on GitHub.",

It's free, forever. If you're just getting acquainted with OpenTelemetry, this is what we'll explore here: Benefits of OpenTelemetry Should I use OpenTelemetry or New Relic agents? How OpenTelemetry works with New Relic Benefits of OpenTelemetry OpenTelemetry provides a secure, vendor-neutral specification for service instrumentation so that you can export data to distinct backends of your choice, such as New Relic. OpenTelemetry offers a single set of APIs and libraries that standardize how you collect and transfer telemetry data for your services. The following components make up the OpenTelemetry project: Specifications for the core pillars of observability to drive consistency across all projects. New Relic supports all of these signals: traces, metrics, and logs (see details below) APIs that contain interfaces and implementations based on the specifications SDKs (reference implementations of the APIs) created specifically for languages like Java, Python, Go, Erlang, and more Collectors that offer a vendor-agnostic implementation for processing and exporting Exporters that enable you to send data to a backend of your choice The components of OpenTelemetry work together to create some distinct advantages for capturing telemetry data: Feature Description Ubiquitous instrumentation A single, open standard of instrumentation provides better coverage and flexibility as engineers from all over the world contribute to the instrumentation. Future proof As the instrumentation gets built into libraries and frameworks, and as more vendors move to support this open standard, you can be confident that you won’t need to change your instrumentation. Support for newer technologies When new technologies emerge, contributors can build integrations into OpenTelemetry or add instrumentation directly to source code, ensuring end users can easily monitor these new technologies. Simplified choice You don’t need to decide which instrumentation option to use (a proprietary option or one of the other open standards). Cross-platform compatibility OpenTelemetry supports a variety of languages and backends. It represents a vendor-neutral path for capturing and transmitting telemetry to backends without altering existing instrumentation. Streamlined observability It is easier for vendors to support and test against a single standard as they don’t need to develop their own agents or collectors. High dimensionality OpenTelemetry uses dimensional metrics, so you can filter and facet on more aspects of the data, such as AWS regions, Kubernetes clusters, or service versions. Dimensional metrics also lead to less time between occurrence and reporting. Should I use OpenTelemetry instrumentation or New Relic agents? As you consider OpenTelemetry, you may also be looking at New Relic APM agents that also capture telemetry data. As you'd expect, there is a lot of overlap between features available from OpenTelemetry agents and SDKs versus those available from New Relic APM agents. This is especially true if you're interested in distributed tracing telemetry data. The choice you make depends on what you need. We recommend that you explore both New Relic and OpenTelemetry instrumentation or discuss this with us in our CNCF Slack channel to decide what works best for you. OpenTelemetry: A work in progress OpenTelemetry is still an emerging standard, so your choices may be affected by what's available. You can check on the current state of the specification at the OpenTelemetry site. The current state of language-specific OpenTelemetry APIs and SDKs varies: some languages are still pre-alpha and may be missing instructions on how to instrument your service. Most languages have some implementation of traces that is sufficient to start exporting data to New Relic. Check out this table in GitHub that provides an overview of the state of OpenTelemetry specification compliance for each language. For languages that New Relic does not currently provide an agent or SDK, OpenTelemetry may offer you a good alternative. Also, in cases where you want explicit control over sampling of your telemetry data, OpenTelemetry provides a lot of flexibility. As OpenTelemetry matures, New Relic will continue to support new OpenTelemetry data models and to provide a curated UI experience for our customers. New Relic's APM agents In general, New Relic's APM agents will collect more telemetry data for your services, and they offer a wide range of configuration options and an extensive set of auto-instrumentation capabilities. New Relic's APM agents offer detailed transaction trace visibility for individual services. They also offer predefined sampling to balance the performance impact of your instrumentation against the need to capture enough data to gain helpful insights. How OpenTelemetry works with New Relic New Relic supports the native OpenTelemetry Protocol (OTLP) for exporting telemetry data. This allows you to use the vendor neutral components developed by the OpenTelemetry community to export your data to New Relic. The following tables show the supported features for each telemetry signal. If you have questions about these or have an unsupported use case, please contact us in our CNCF Slack channel, and watch this page for future updates. Important New Relic's exporters for OpenTelemetry are now deprecated in favor of exporting data to New Relic using OTLP. Traces New Relic offers support for the OTLP ingest of trace signals. The maturity of the upstream specification is stable. OpenTelemetry traces and spans are compatible with New Relic traces and spans. OpenTelemetry spans optionally include attributes (name-value pairs) and resource attributes which map directly to dimensions that can be used to facet or filter span data at query time. OpenTelemetry span metadata (for example, name, kind, and trace_id) also map directly to dimensions on NewRelic spans. At this time, New Relic does not support span links or array attributes. For details, see the Traces section of our best practices guide. Feature Supported Span events ✅ Span linking ❌ Array of primitives (homogeneous) ❌ Metrics New Relic offers support for the OTLP ingest of metric signals. Note that the maturity of the upstream specification is experimental. We intend to follow potentially breaking upstream changes. Here are the OpenTelemetry data types we support and their associated mappings. For details, see the Metrics section of our best practices guide. Metric Type Supported Delta sums ✅ Cumulative sums ✅ Gauges ✅ Delta histograms ✅ Summary ✅ Cumulative histograms ❌ Exemplars ❌ Array of primitives (homogeneous) ❌ Logs New Relic offers support for the OTLP ingest of log signals. Note that the maturity of the upstream specification is experimental. We intend to follow potentially breaking upstream changes. OpenTelemetry logs are compatible with New Relic logs. OpenTelemetry logs optionally include attributes (name-value pairs) and resource attributes which map directly to dimensions that can be used to facet or filter log data at query time. OpenTelemetry log metadata (for example, name, severity_text, and trace_id) also map directly to dimensions on New Relic logs. NewRelic currently supports all OpenTelemetry log message types except for arrays. For more details, see the Logs section of our best practices guide. Feature Supported Description LogRecord body ✅ Supported types: string, boolean, int, double, bytes LogRecord attributes ✅ Supported types: string, boolean, int, double, bytes LogRecord fields ✅ Examples: name, severity_text, trace_id Array messages ❌ Array attributes ❌ Next steps Follow the OpenTelemetry quick start to help you get started.

Here's an overview of the process, followed by details for each step. Prerequisites Instrument your service with OpenTelemetry Export your telemetry data to New Relic View your data in the New Relic UI Step 1. Prerequisites First things first: If we don’t already know you, sign up for a free New Relic account. Copy your account license key. Step 2. Instrument your service with OpenTelemetry To get started, you instrument your service with OpenTelemetry. OpenTelemetry has language-specific products and SDKs to help you. Many languages offer out-the-box instrumentation for common libraries and frameworks. Each language also provides an API for further instrumenting your service manually. Go to the repository for your language and follow the instructions to instrument your service. When you're done, return here to complete Step 3. Export your telemetry data to New Relic. C++ Erlang Go Java Javascript/Node.js .NET PHP Python Ruby Rust Swift ...See a complete list of languages in GitHub Step 3. Export your telemetry data to New Relic The OpenTelemetry Protocol, or OTLP for short, is a general purpose telemetry data delivery protocol designed for the OpenTelemetry project. This protocol describes how to encode and transmit telemetry data, which makes it a natural choice for data transport. Each language SDK provides an OTLP exporter you can configure to export data over OTLP. In this step, we focus on how to configure an OTLP exporter in your service to export data directly to New Relic. If you prefer to export your data first to an OpenTelemetry collector, we have separate instructions. Here's an example of sending data from your service directly to New Relic. To complete this third step, first familiarize yourself with some required New Relic settings, and then complete the steps in the OTLP exporter documentation for your language. Review New Relic settings for exports Before you go to the external OTLP exporter documentation, consult the table below so you're ready to do the following: Configure the OTLP exporter to add a header (api-key) whose value is the license key for the New Relic account you want to send data to. Based on your region, configure the endpoint where the exporter sends data to New Relic. Region gRPC HTTP/1.1 Endpoint API header name API header value TLS encryption required US ✅ ❌ https://otlp.nr-data.net:4317 api-key License key ✅ EU ✅ ❌ https://otlp.eu01.nr-data.net:4317 api-key License key ✅ Important If you have FedRamp compliance constraints, you will need to use https://gov-otlp.nr-data.net:4317. Please see FedRAMP-compliant endpoints for further information. Important In Node.js, the opentelemetry-collector-grpc library requires additional options to enable TLS. Complete the export configuration steps Click on the link below for your language and complete the configuration steps. When you're done, return here to complete Step 4. View your data in the New Relic UI. C++ Erlang Go Java Javascript/Node.js .NET PHP Python Ruby Rust Swift ...Find additional OTLP language support in GitHub Export data to an OpenTelemetry Collector (optional) The OpenTelemetry Collector is a configurable and extensible software component to receive, process, and export telemetry data. When you set up a collector, it can operate as a gateway or as an agent: Gateway: The collector receives data from a variety of sources and applies standard processing before exporting to some backend. Agent: The collector is deployed on each host in an environment and can collect telemetry data about the host and processes running on it. When you use a collector, you start by following the same routine as above for setting up OTLP in your service. In this case, instead of exporting data directly to New Relic, you export through a collector that you set up. In the collector, you configure the OTLP exporter to export data to New Relic. When your data goes through a collector, the transport looks like this: Here's a Docker example of how to set up and run an OpenTelemetry collector with the collector YAML: Save the following as otel-config.yaml: receivers: otlp: protocols: grpc: http: processors: batch: exporters: otlp: endpoint: ${OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_ENDPOINT} headers: api-key: ${NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY} service: pipelines: traces: receivers: [otlp] processors: [batch] exporters: [otlp] metrics: receivers: [otlp] processors: [batch] exporters: [otlp] logs: receivers: [otlp] processors: [batch] exporters: [otlp] Copy Run the OpenTelemetry collector, making sure you replace OTLP_ENDPOINT_HERE with the appropriate endpoint and replace YOUR_KEY_HERE with your account's license key: export OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_ENDPOINT=OTLP_ENDPOINT_HERE export NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY=YOUR_KEY_HERE docker run --rm \\ -e OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_ENDPOINT \\ -e NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY \\ -p 4317:4317 \\ -v \"${PWD}/otel-config.yaml\":/otel-config.yaml \\ --config otel-config.yaml \\ --name otelcol \\ otel/opentelemetry-collector Copy Step 4. View your data in the New Relic UI Once you’ve instrumented your service and configured it to export its data to New Relic, watch the New Relic One user interface for your traces, metrics, and logs! The UI for OpenTelemetry has some similarities to the APM agent UI, so if you are familiar with that, you can go right to the UI.

Simplified choice You don’t need to decide which instrumentation option to use (a proprietary option or one of the other open standards). Cross-platform compatibility OpenTelemetry supports a variety of languages and backends. It represents a vendor-neutral path for capturing and transmitting telemetry to backends without altering existing instrumentation. Streamlined observability It is easier for vendors to support and test against a single standard as they don’t need to develop their own agents or collectors. High dimensionality OpenTelemetry uses dimensional metrics, so you can filter and facet on more aspects of the data, such as AWS regions, Kubernetes clusters, or service versions. Dimensional metrics also lead to less time between occurrence and reporting. Should I use OpenTelemetry instrumentation or New Relic agents? As you consider OpenTelemetry, you may also be looking at New Relic APM agents that also capture telemetry data. As you'd expect, there is a lot of overlap between features available from OpenTelemetry agents and SDKs versus those available from New Relic APM agents. This is especially true if you're interested in distributed tracing telemetry data. The choice you make depends on what you need. We recommend that you explore both New Relic and OpenTelemetry instrumentation or discuss this with us in our CNCF Slack channel to decide what works best for you. OpenTelemetry: A work in progress OpenTelemetry is still an emerging standard, so your choices may be affected by what's available. You can check on the current state of the specification at the OpenTelemetry site. The current state of language-specific OpenTelemetry APIs and SDKs varies: some languages are still pre-alpha and may be missing instructions on how to instrument your service. Most languages have some implementation of traces that is sufficient to start exporting data to New Relic. Check out this table in GitHub that provides an overview of the state of OpenTelemetry specification compliance for each language. For languages that New Relic does not currently provide an agent or SDK, OpenTelemetry may offer you a good alternative. Also, in cases where you want explicit control over sampling of your telemetry data, OpenTelemetry provides a lot of flexibility. As OpenTelemetry matures, New Relic will continue to support new OpenTelemetry data models and to provide a curated UI experience for our customers. New Relic's APM agents In general, New Relic's APM agents will collect more telemetry data for your services, and they offer a wide range of configuration options and an extensive set of auto-instrumentation capabilities. New Relic's APM agents offer detailed transaction trace visibility for individual services. They also offer predefined sampling to balance the performance impact of your instrumentation against the need to capture enough data to gain helpful insights. How OpenTelemetry works with New Relic New Relic supports the native OpenTelemetry Protocol (OTLP) for exporting telemetry data. This allows you to use the vendor neutral components developed by the OpenTelemetry community to export your data to New Relic. The following tables show the supported features for each telemetry signal. If you have questions about these or have an unsupported use case, please contact us in our CNCF Slack channel, and watch this page for future updates. Important New Relic's exporters for OpenTelemetry are now deprecated in favor of exporting data to New Relic using OTLP. Traces New Relic offers support for the OTLP ingest of trace signals. The maturity of the upstream specification is stable. OpenTelemetry traces and spans are compatible with New Relic traces and spans. OpenTelemetry spans optionally include attributes (name-value pairs) and resource attributes which map directly to dimensions that can be used to facet or filter span data at query time. OpenTelemetry span metadata (for example, name, kind, and trace_id) also map directly to dimensions on NewRelic spans. At this time, New Relic does not support span links or array attributes. For details, see the Traces section of our best practices guide. Feature Supported Span events ✅ Span linking ❌ Array of primitives (homogeneous) ❌ Metrics New Relic offers support for the OTLP ingest of metric signals.

Here's an overview of the process, followed by details for each step. Prerequisites Instrument your service with OpenTelemetry Export your telemetry data to New Relic View your data in the New Relic UI Step 1. Prerequisites First things first: If we don’t already know you, sign up for a free New Relic account. Copy your account license key. Step 2. Instrument your service with OpenTelemetry To get started, you instrument your service with OpenTelemetry. OpenTelemetry has language-specific products and SDKs to help you. Many languages offer out-the-box instrumentation for common libraries and frameworks. Each language also provides an API for further instrumenting your service manually. Go to the repository for your language and follow the instructions to instrument your service. When you're done, return here to complete Step 3. Export your telemetry data to New Relic. C++ Erlang Go Java Javascript/Node.js .NET PHP Python Ruby Rust Swift ...See a complete list of languages in GitHub Step 3. Export your telemetry data to New Relic The OpenTelemetry Protocol, or OTLP for short, is a general purpose telemetry data delivery protocol designed for the OpenTelemetry project. This protocol describes how to encode and transmit telemetry data, which makes it a natural choice for data transport. Each language SDK provides an OTLP exporter you can configure to export data over OTLP. In this step, we focus on how to configure an OTLP exporter in your service to export data directly to New Relic. If you prefer to export your data first to an OpenTelemetry collector, we have separate instructions. Here's an example of sending data from your service directly to New Relic. To complete this third step, first familiarize yourself with some required New Relic settings, and then complete the steps in the OTLP exporter documentation for your language. Review New Relic settings for exports Before you go to the external OTLP exporter documentation, consult the table below so you're ready to do the following: Configure the OTLP exporter to add a header (api-key) whose value is the license key for the New Relic account you want to send data to. Based on your region, configure the endpoint where the exporter sends data to New Relic. Region gRPC HTTP/1.1 Endpoint API header name API header value TLS encryption required US ✅ ❌ https://otlp.nr-data.net:4317 api-key License key ✅ EU ✅ ❌ https://otlp.eu01.nr-data.net:4317 api-key License key ✅ Important If you have FedRamp compliance constraints, you will need to use https://gov-otlp.nr-data.net:4317. Please see FedRAMP-compliant endpoints for further information. Important In Node.js, the opentelemetry-collector-grpc library requires additional options to enable TLS. Complete the export configuration steps Click on the link below for your language and complete the configuration steps. When you're done, return here to complete Step 4. View your data in the New Relic UI. C++ Erlang Go Java Javascript/Node.js .NET PHP Python Ruby Rust Swift ...Find additional OTLP language support in GitHub Export data to an OpenTelemetry Collector (optional) The OpenTelemetry Collector is a configurable and extensible software component to receive, process, and export telemetry data. When you set up a collector, it can operate as a gateway or as an agent: Gateway: The collector receives data from a variety of sources and applies standard processing before exporting to some backend. Agent: The collector is deployed on each host in an environment and can collect telemetry data about the host and processes running on it. When you use a collector, you start by following the same routine as above for setting up OTLP in your service. In this case, instead of exporting data directly to New Relic, you export through a collector that you set up. In the collector, you configure the OTLP exporter to export data to New Relic. When your data goes through a collector, the transport looks like this: Here's a Docker example of how to set up and run an OpenTelemetry collector with the collector YAML: Save the following as otel-config.yaml: receivers: otlp: protocols: grpc: http: processors: batch: exporters: otlp: endpoint: ${OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_ENDPOINT} headers: api-key: ${NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY} service: pipelines: traces: receivers: [otlp] processors: [batch] exporters: [otlp] metrics: receivers: [otlp] processors: [batch] exporters: [otlp] logs: receivers: [otlp] processors: [batch] exporters: [otlp] Copy Run the OpenTelemetry collector, making sure you replace OTLP_ENDPOINT_HERE with the appropriate endpoint and replace YOUR_KEY_HERE with your account's license key: export OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_ENDPOINT=OTLP_ENDPOINT_HERE export NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY=YOUR_KEY_HERE docker run --rm \\ -e OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_ENDPOINT \\ -e NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY \\ -p 4317:4317 \\ -v \"${PWD}/otel-config.yaml\":/otel-config.yaml \\ --config otel-config.yaml \\ --name otelcol \\ otel/opentelemetry-collector Copy Step 4. View your data in the New Relic UI Once you’ve instrumented your service and configured it to export its data to New Relic, watch the New Relic One user interface for your traces, metrics, and logs! The UI for OpenTelemetry has some similarities to the APM agent UI, so if you are familiar with that, you can go right to the UI.

      "body": "Troubleshooting OpenTelemetry with New Relic may just be a matter of making sure you are following best practices, but sometimes you may need to take additional steps to diagnose your issues. Here are some examples of specific problems you might encounter, along with steps and tools to resolve them. OpenTelemetry data sent via OTLP is not queryable Problem You sent OpenTelemetry metrics, logs, or traces using OTLP and are unable to view the data. Before digging deeper, make sure you've checked the following: The OTLP endpoint configured matches one of our documented endpoints, is properly formatted, and includes the official default port, 4317. Sending OTLP data via port 443 is not supported at this time. Please note the specific endpoint for FedRAMP compliance, if applicable. The outbound traffic is not restricted by a firewall. Our Networks document explains domains and network blocks that you may need to explicitly allow. The client is configured to use TLS 1.2 or higher and the request includes the api-key header with a valid New Relic account (ingest) license key. Requests include valid protobuf payloads and use gRPC and HTTP/2 transport, preferably with gzip compression enabled. Sending protobuf or JSON-encoded payloads over HTTP/1.1 is not supported at this time. Client output and logs do not indicate 4xx or 5xx response codes are being returned. Solution There are number of tools you can use to validate the successful delivery of telemetry data to our platform. A good first step is to check the data management hub to facet data ingest and determine how much data is arriving from various sources. You can also use the data explorer or query builder to look for data faceted by instrumentation.provider or newrelic.source attributes: FROM Log, Metric, Span SELECT datapointcount() WHERE instrumentation.provider = 'opentelemetry' FACET instrumentation.provider, newrelic.source Copy This query should tell you whether data is arriving via OTLP. If the data you expect is not present, try removing the WHERE clause or checking for integration errors. Querying NrIntegrationError events can help you determine whether you have configuration or format issues or if you've run into our platform limits. Important The ingest limits for metrics, logs, and traces via OTLP are the same as our other data ingest API limits. Various parts of the New Relic UI rely on the presence of specific attributes to function properly. You can use the NRQL console feature in many places to check the WHERE or FACET clauses of the query for required attributes. You can also edit those clauses and re-run the query to determine whether there is data present with those attributes missing. Examples of required attributes include service.name and service.instance.id. For a more complete list of examples, see resources. OpenTelemetry entities or relationships are missing Problem You sent OpenTelemetry data from a service or infrastructure component and either the entity or its relationships are missing or incorrect. Solution OpenTelemetry entities will be synthesized based on the public rules described for the EXT-SERVICE entity type. The standard rule to match relies on the presence of the service.name dimension which follows the OpenTelemetry semantic conventions. To set the service.name with the OpenTelemetry Java SDK, include it in your resource: var resource = Resource.getDefault() .merge(Resource.builder().put(SERVICE_NAME, serviceName).build()); Copy Depending on the SDK, you may also set the service.name by declaring it in the OTEL_RESOURCE_ATTRIBUTES or OTEL_SERVICE_NAME environment variables. For Logs, you can use a structured log template to inject the service.name. Here are some log examples: Setting the service name Logs in context with Log4j2 Tip For more OpenTelemetry examples with New Relic, visit the newrelic-opentelemetry-examples repository on GitHub.",

It's free, forever. If you're just getting acquainted with OpenTelemetry, this is what we'll explore here: Benefits of OpenTelemetry Should I use OpenTelemetry or New Relic agents? How OpenTelemetry works with New Relic Benefits of OpenTelemetry OpenTelemetry provides a secure, vendor-neutral specification for service instrumentation so that you can export data to distinct backends of your choice, such as New Relic. OpenTelemetry offers a single set of APIs and libraries that standardize how you collect and transfer telemetry data for your services. The following components make up the OpenTelemetry project: Specifications for the core pillars of observability to drive consistency across all projects. New Relic supports all of these signals: traces, metrics, and logs (see details below) APIs that contain interfaces and implementations based on the specifications SDKs (reference implementations of the APIs) created specifically for languages like Java, Python, Go, Erlang, and more Collectors that offer a vendor-agnostic implementation for processing and exporting Exporters that enable you to send data to a backend of your choice The components of OpenTelemetry work together to create some distinct advantages for capturing telemetry data: Feature Description Ubiquitous instrumentation A single, open standard of instrumentation provides better coverage and flexibility as engineers from all over the world contribute to the instrumentation. Future proof As the instrumentation gets built into libraries and frameworks, and as more vendors move to support this open standard, you can be confident that you won’t need to change your instrumentation. Support for newer technologies When new technologies emerge, contributors can build integrations into OpenTelemetry or add instrumentation directly to source code, ensuring end users can easily monitor these new technologies. Simplified choice You don’t need to decide which instrumentation option to use (a proprietary option or one of the other open standards). Cross-platform compatibility OpenTelemetry supports a variety of languages and backends. It represents a vendor-neutral path for capturing and transmitting telemetry to backends without altering existing instrumentation. Streamlined observability It is easier for vendors to support and test against a single standard as they don’t need to develop their own agents or collectors. High dimensionality OpenTelemetry uses dimensional metrics, so you can filter and facet on more aspects of the data, such as AWS regions, Kubernetes clusters, or service versions. Dimensional metrics also lead to less time between occurrence and reporting. Should I use OpenTelemetry instrumentation or New Relic agents? As you consider OpenTelemetry, you may also be looking at New Relic APM agents that also capture telemetry data. As you'd expect, there is a lot of overlap between features available from OpenTelemetry agents and SDKs versus those available from New Relic APM agents. This is especially true if you're interested in distributed tracing telemetry data. The choice you make depends on what you need. We recommend that you explore both New Relic and OpenTelemetry instrumentation or discuss this with us in our CNCF Slack channel to decide what works best for you. OpenTelemetry: A work in progress OpenTelemetry is still an emerging standard, so your choices may be affected by what's available. You can check on the current state of the specification at the OpenTelemetry site. The current state of language-specific OpenTelemetry APIs and SDKs varies: some languages are still pre-alpha and may be missing instructions on how to instrument your service. Most languages have some implementation of traces that is sufficient to start exporting data to New Relic. Check out this table in GitHub that provides an overview of the state of OpenTelemetry specification compliance for each language. For languages that New Relic does not currently provide an agent or SDK, OpenTelemetry may offer you a good alternative. Also, in cases where you want explicit control over sampling of your telemetry data, OpenTelemetry provides a lot of flexibility. As OpenTelemetry matures, New Relic will continue to support new OpenTelemetry data models and to provide a curated UI experience for our customers. New Relic's APM agents In general, New Relic's APM agents will collect more telemetry data for your services, and they offer a wide range of configuration options and an extensive set of auto-instrumentation capabilities. New Relic's APM agents offer detailed transaction trace visibility for individual services. They also offer predefined sampling to balance the performance impact of your instrumentation against the need to capture enough data to gain helpful insights. How OpenTelemetry works with New Relic New Relic supports the native OpenTelemetry Protocol (OTLP) for exporting telemetry data. This allows you to use the vendor neutral components developed by the OpenTelemetry community to export your data to New Relic. The following tables show the supported features for each telemetry signal. If you have questions about these or have an unsupported use case, please contact us in our CNCF Slack channel, and watch this page for future updates. Important New Relic's exporters for OpenTelemetry are now deprecated in favor of exporting data to New Relic using OTLP. Traces New Relic offers support for the OTLP ingest of trace signals. The maturity of the upstream specification is stable. OpenTelemetry traces and spans are compatible with New Relic traces and spans. OpenTelemetry spans optionally include attributes (name-value pairs) and resource attributes which map directly to dimensions that can be used to facet or filter span data at query time. OpenTelemetry span metadata (for example, name, kind, and trace_id) also map directly to dimensions on NewRelic spans. At this time, New Relic does not support span links or array attributes. For details, see the Traces section of our best practices guide. Feature Supported Span events ✅ Span linking ❌ Array of primitives (homogeneous) ❌ Metrics New Relic offers support for the OTLP ingest of metric signals. Note that the maturity of the upstream specification is experimental. We intend to follow potentially breaking upstream changes. Here are the OpenTelemetry data types we support and their associated mappings. For details, see the Metrics section of our best practices guide. Metric Type Supported Delta sums ✅ Cumulative sums ✅ Gauges ✅ Delta histograms ✅ Summary ✅ Cumulative histograms ❌ Exemplars ❌ Array of primitives (homogeneous) ❌ Logs New Relic offers support for the OTLP ingest of log signals. Note that the maturity of the upstream specification is experimental. We intend to follow potentially breaking upstream changes. OpenTelemetry logs are compatible with New Relic logs. OpenTelemetry logs optionally include attributes (name-value pairs) and resource attributes which map directly to dimensions that can be used to facet or filter log data at query time. OpenTelemetry log metadata (for example, name, severity_text, and trace_id) also map directly to dimensions on New Relic logs. NewRelic currently supports all OpenTelemetry log message types except for arrays. For more details, see the Logs section of our best practices guide. Feature Supported Description LogRecord body ✅ Supported types: string, boolean, int, double, bytes LogRecord attributes ✅ Supported types: string, boolean, int, double, bytes LogRecord fields ✅ Examples: name, severity_text, trace_id Array messages ❌ Array attributes ❌ Next steps Follow the OpenTelemetry quick start to help you get started.

Here's an overview of the process, followed by details for each step. Prerequisites Instrument your service with OpenTelemetry Export your telemetry data to New Relic View your data in the New Relic UI Step 1. Prerequisites First things first: If we don’t already know you, sign up for a free New Relic account. Copy your account license key. Step 2. Instrument your service with OpenTelemetry To get started, you instrument your service with OpenTelemetry. OpenTelemetry has language-specific products and SDKs to help you. Many languages offer out-the-box instrumentation for common libraries and frameworks. Each language also provides an API for further instrumenting your service manually. Go to the repository for your language and follow the instructions to instrument your service. When you're done, return here to complete Step 3. Export your telemetry data to New Relic. C++ Erlang Go Java Javascript/Node.js .NET PHP Python Ruby Rust Swift ...See a complete list of languages in GitHub Step 3. Export your telemetry data to New Relic The OpenTelemetry Protocol, or OTLP for short, is a general purpose telemetry data delivery protocol designed for the OpenTelemetry project. This protocol describes how to encode and transmit telemetry data, which makes it a natural choice for data transport. Each language SDK provides an OTLP exporter you can configure to export data over OTLP. In this step, we focus on how to configure an OTLP exporter in your service to export data directly to New Relic. If you prefer to export your data first to an OpenTelemetry collector, we have separate instructions. Here's an example of sending data from your service directly to New Relic. To complete this third step, first familiarize yourself with some required New Relic settings, and then complete the steps in the OTLP exporter documentation for your language. Review New Relic settings for exports Before you go to the external OTLP exporter documentation, consult the table below so you're ready to do the following: Configure the OTLP exporter to add a header (api-key) whose value is the license key for the New Relic account you want to send data to. Based on your region, configure the endpoint where the exporter sends data to New Relic. Region gRPC HTTP/1.1 Endpoint API header name API header value TLS encryption required US ✅ ❌ https://otlp.nr-data.net:4317 api-key License key ✅ EU ✅ ❌ https://otlp.eu01.nr-data.net:4317 api-key License key ✅ Important If you have FedRamp compliance constraints, you will need to use https://gov-otlp.nr-data.net:4317. Please see FedRAMP-compliant endpoints for further information. Important In Node.js, the opentelemetry-collector-grpc library requires additional options to enable TLS. Complete the export configuration steps Click on the link below for your language and complete the configuration steps. When you're done, return here to complete Step 4. View your data in the New Relic UI. C++ Erlang Go Java Javascript/Node.js .NET PHP Python Ruby Rust Swift ...Find additional OTLP language support in GitHub Export data to an OpenTelemetry Collector (optional) The OpenTelemetry Collector is a configurable and extensible software component to receive, process, and export telemetry data. When you set up a collector, it can operate as a gateway or as an agent: Gateway: The collector receives data from a variety of sources and applies standard processing before exporting to some backend. Agent: The collector is deployed on each host in an environment and can collect telemetry data about the host and processes running on it. When you use a collector, you start by following the same routine as above for setting up OTLP in your service. In this case, instead of exporting data directly to New Relic, you export through a collector that you set up. In the collector, you configure the OTLP exporter to export data to New Relic. When your data goes through a collector, the transport looks like this: Here's a Docker example of how to set up and run an OpenTelemetry collector with the collector YAML: Save the following as otel-config.yaml: receivers: otlp: protocols: grpc: http: processors: batch: exporters: otlp: endpoint: ${OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_ENDPOINT} headers: api-key: ${NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY} service: pipelines: traces: receivers: [otlp] processors: [batch] exporters: [otlp] metrics: receivers: [otlp] processors: [batch] exporters: [otlp] logs: receivers: [otlp] processors: [batch] exporters: [otlp] Copy Run the OpenTelemetry collector, making sure you replace OTLP_ENDPOINT_HERE with the appropriate endpoint and replace YOUR_KEY_HERE with your account's license key: export OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_ENDPOINT=OTLP_ENDPOINT_HERE export NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY=YOUR_KEY_HERE docker run --rm \\ -e OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_ENDPOINT \\ -e NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY \\ -p 4317:4317 \\ -v \"${PWD}/otel-config.yaml\":/otel-config.yaml \\ --config otel-config.yaml \\ --name otelcol \\ otel/opentelemetry-collector Copy Step 4. View your data in the New Relic UI Once you’ve instrumented your service and configured it to export its data to New Relic, watch the New Relic One user interface for your traces, metrics, and logs! The UI for OpenTelemetry has some similarities to the APM agent UI, so if you are familiar with that, you can go right to the UI.

It's free, forever. If you're just getting acquainted with OpenTelemetry, this is what we'll explore here: Benefits of OpenTelemetry Should I use OpenTelemetry or New Relic agents? How OpenTelemetry works with New Relic Benefits of OpenTelemetry OpenTelemetry provides a secure, vendor-neutral specification for service instrumentation so that you can export data to distinct backends of your choice, such as New Relic. OpenTelemetry offers a single set of APIs and libraries that standardize how you collect and transfer telemetry data for your services. The following components make up the OpenTelemetry project: Specifications for the core pillars of observability to drive consistency across all projects. New Relic supports all of these signals: traces, metrics, and logs (see details below) APIs that contain interfaces and implementations based on the specifications SDKs (reference implementations of the APIs) created specifically for languages like Java, Python, Go, Erlang, and more Collectors that offer a vendor-agnostic implementation for processing and exporting Exporters that enable you to send data to a backend of your choice The components of OpenTelemetry work together to create some distinct advantages for capturing telemetry data: Feature Description Ubiquitous instrumentation A single, open standard of instrumentation provides better coverage and flexibility as engineers from all over the world contribute to the instrumentation. Future proof As the instrumentation gets built into libraries and frameworks, and as more vendors move to support this open standard, you can be confident that you won’t need to change your instrumentation. Support for newer technologies When new technologies emerge, contributors can build integrations into OpenTelemetry or add instrumentation directly to source code, ensuring end users can easily monitor these new technologies. Simplified choice You don’t need to decide which instrumentation option to use (a proprietary option or one of the other open standards). Cross-platform compatibility OpenTelemetry supports a variety of languages and backends. It represents a vendor-neutral path for capturing and transmitting telemetry to backends without altering existing instrumentation. Streamlined observability It is easier for vendors to support and test against a single standard as they don’t need to develop their own agents or collectors. High dimensionality OpenTelemetry uses dimensional metrics, so you can filter and facet on more aspects of the data, such as AWS regions, Kubernetes clusters, or service versions. Dimensional metrics also lead to less time between occurrence and reporting. Should I use OpenTelemetry instrumentation or New Relic agents? As you consider OpenTelemetry, you may also be looking at New Relic APM agents that also capture telemetry data. As you'd expect, there is a lot of overlap between features available from OpenTelemetry agents and SDKs versus those available from New Relic APM agents. This is especially true if you're interested in distributed tracing telemetry data. The choice you make depends on what you need. We recommend that you explore both New Relic and OpenTelemetry instrumentation or discuss this with us in our CNCF Slack channel to decide what works best for you. OpenTelemetry: A work in progress OpenTelemetry is still an emerging standard, so your choices may be affected by what's available. You can check on the current state of the specification at the OpenTelemetry site. The current state of language-specific OpenTelemetry APIs and SDKs varies: some languages are still pre-alpha and may be missing instructions on how to instrument your service. Most languages have some implementation of traces that is sufficient to start exporting data to New Relic. Check out this table in GitHub that provides an overview of the state of OpenTelemetry specification compliance for each language. For languages that New Relic does not currently provide an agent or SDK, OpenTelemetry may offer you a good alternative. Also, in cases where you want explicit control over sampling of your telemetry data, OpenTelemetry provides a lot of flexibility. As OpenTelemetry matures, New Relic will continue to support new OpenTelemetry data models and to provide a curated UI experience for our customers. New Relic's APM agents In general, New Relic's APM agents will collect more telemetry data for your services, and they offer a wide range of configuration options and an extensive set of auto-instrumentation capabilities. New Relic's APM agents offer detailed transaction trace visibility for individual services. They also offer predefined sampling to balance the performance impact of your instrumentation against the need to capture enough data to gain helpful insights. How OpenTelemetry works with New Relic New Relic supports the native OpenTelemetry Protocol (OTLP) for exporting telemetry data. This allows you to use the vendor neutral components developed by the OpenTelemetry community to export your data to New Relic. The following tables show the supported features for each telemetry signal. If you have questions about these or have an unsupported use case, please contact us in our CNCF Slack channel, and watch this page for future updates. Important New Relic's exporters for OpenTelemetry are now deprecated in favor of exporting data to New Relic using OTLP. Traces New Relic offers support for the OTLP ingest of trace signals. The maturity of the upstream specification is stable. OpenTelemetry traces and spans are compatible with New Relic traces and spans. OpenTelemetry spans optionally include attributes (name-value pairs) and resource attributes which map directly to dimensions that can be used to facet or filter span data at query time. OpenTelemetry span metadata (for example, name, kind, and trace_id) also map directly to dimensions on NewRelic spans. At this time, New Relic does not support span links or array attributes. For details, see the Traces section of our best practices guide. Feature Supported Span events ✅ Span linking ❌ Array of primitives (homogeneous) ❌ Metrics New Relic offers support for the OTLP ingest of metric signals. Note that the maturity of the upstream specification is experimental. We intend to follow potentially breaking upstream changes. Here are the OpenTelemetry data types we support and their associated mappings. For details, see the Metrics section of our best practices guide. Metric Type Supported Delta sums ✅ Cumulative sums ✅ Gauges ✅ Delta histograms ✅ Summary ✅ Cumulative histograms ❌ Exemplars ❌ Array of primitives (homogeneous) ❌ Logs New Relic offers support for the OTLP ingest of log signals. Note that the maturity of the upstream specification is experimental. We intend to follow potentially breaking upstream changes. OpenTelemetry logs are compatible with New Relic logs. OpenTelemetry logs optionally include attributes (name-value pairs) and resource attributes which map directly to dimensions that can be used to facet or filter log data at query time. OpenTelemetry log metadata (for example, name, severity_text, and trace_id) also map directly to dimensions on New Relic logs. NewRelic currently supports all OpenTelemetry log message types except for arrays. For more details, see the Logs section of our best practices guide. Feature Supported Description LogRecord body ✅ Supported types: string, boolean, int, double, bytes LogRecord attributes ✅ Supported types: string, boolean, int, double, bytes LogRecord fields ✅ Examples: name, severity_text, trace_id Array messages ❌ Array attributes ❌ Next steps Follow the OpenTelemetry quick start to help you get started. You'll also want to review the best practices guide for getting the most out of the data you export to New Relic.",

Here's an overview of the process, followed by details for each step. Prerequisites Instrument your service with OpenTelemetry Export your telemetry data to New Relic View your data in the New Relic UI Step 1. Prerequisites First things first: If we don’t already know you, sign up for a free New Relic account. Copy your account license key. Step 2. Instrument your service with OpenTelemetry To get started, you instrument your service with OpenTelemetry. OpenTelemetry has language-specific products and SDKs to help you. Many languages offer out-the-box instrumentation for common libraries and frameworks. Each language also provides an API for further instrumenting your service manually. Go to the repository for your language and follow the instructions to instrument your service. When you're done, return here to complete Step 3. Export your telemetry data to New Relic. C++ Erlang Go Java Javascript/Node.js .NET PHP Python Ruby Rust Swift ...See a complete list of languages in GitHub Step 3. Export your telemetry data to New Relic The OpenTelemetry Protocol, or OTLP for short, is a general purpose telemetry data delivery protocol designed for the OpenTelemetry project. This protocol describes how to encode and transmit telemetry data, which makes it a natural choice for data transport. Each language SDK provides an OTLP exporter you can configure to export data over OTLP. In this step, we focus on how to configure an OTLP exporter in your service to export data directly to New Relic. If you prefer to export your data first to an OpenTelemetry collector, we have separate instructions. Here's an example of sending data from your service directly to New Relic. To complete this third step, first familiarize yourself with some required New Relic settings, and then complete the steps in the OTLP exporter documentation for your language. Review New Relic settings for exports Before you go to the external OTLP exporter documentation, consult the table below so you're ready to do the following: Configure the OTLP exporter to add a header (api-key) whose value is the license key for the New Relic account you want to send data to. Based on your region, configure the endpoint where the exporter sends data to New Relic. Region gRPC HTTP/1.1 Endpoint API header name API header value TLS encryption required US ✅ ❌ https://otlp.nr-data.net:4317 api-key License key ✅ EU ✅ ❌ https://otlp.eu01.nr-data.net:4317 api-key License key ✅ Important If you have FedRamp compliance constraints, you will need to use https://gov-otlp.nr-data.net:4317. Please see FedRAMP-compliant endpoints for further information. Important In Node.js, the opentelemetry-collector-grpc library requires additional options to enable TLS. Complete the export configuration steps Click on the link below for your language and complete the configuration steps. When you're done, return here to complete Step 4. View your data in the New Relic UI. C++ Erlang Go Java Javascript/Node.js .NET PHP Python Ruby Rust Swift ...Find additional OTLP language support in GitHub Export data to an OpenTelemetry Collector (optional) The OpenTelemetry Collector is a configurable and extensible software component to receive, process, and export telemetry data. When you set up a collector, it can operate as a gateway or as an agent: Gateway: The collector receives data from a variety of sources and applies standard processing before exporting to some backend. Agent: The collector is deployed on each host in an environment and can collect telemetry data about the host and processes running on it. When you use a collector, you start by following the same routine as above for setting up OTLP in your service. In this case, instead of exporting data directly to New Relic, you export through a collector that you set up. In the collector, you configure the OTLP exporter to export data to New Relic. When your data goes through a collector, the transport looks like this: Here's a Docker example of how to set up and run an OpenTelemetry collector with the collector YAML: Save the following as otel-config.yaml: receivers: otlp: protocols: grpc: http: processors: batch: exporters: otlp: endpoint: ${OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_ENDPOINT} headers: api-key: ${NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY} service: pipelines: traces: receivers: [otlp] processors: [batch] exporters: [otlp] metrics: receivers: [otlp] processors: [batch] exporters: [otlp] logs: receivers: [otlp] processors: [batch] exporters: [otlp] Copy Run the OpenTelemetry collector, making sure you replace OTLP_ENDPOINT_HERE with the appropriate endpoint and replace YOUR_KEY_HERE with your account's license key: export OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_ENDPOINT=OTLP_ENDPOINT_HERE export NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY=YOUR_KEY_HERE docker run --rm \\ -e OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_ENDPOINT \\ -e NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY \\ -p 4317:4317 \\ -v \"${PWD}/otel-config.yaml\":/otel-config.yaml \\ --config otel-config.yaml \\ --name otelcol \\ otel/opentelemetry-collector Copy Step 4. View your data in the New Relic UI Once you’ve instrumented your service and configured it to export its data to New Relic, watch the New Relic One user interface for your traces, metrics, and logs! The UI for OpenTelemetry has some similarities to the APM agent UI, so if you are familiar with that, you can go right to the UI.

      "body": "New Relic's Java agent includes built-in instrumentation of the most popular parts of the Java ecosystem, including app servers, frameworks, databases, and message queuing systems. For frameworks and libraries that are not instrumented out of the box, you can extend the agent with Java custom instrumentation. Want to try out New Relic's Java agent? Create a New Relic account for free! No credit card required. Requirements to install the agent Before you install the Java agent, ensure your system meets these requirements: JVM Tip The Java agent is compatible with any JVM-based language, including: Java, Scala, Kotlin, and Clojure. For instrumentation support for language-specific features, see the Automatically instrumented frameworks and libraries section below. In order to continue to innovate and efficiently provide new capabilities to our customers, we'll occasionally need to drop support for older JVM versions. When that happens, you can continue using a version of the agent that supports your older JVM version, but new features and fixes won't be included in those older agent versions. We recommend upgrading to a currently supported JVM version to take advantage of the latest agent releases. Please see the table of compatible agent versions to determine which JVM versions are compatible. Java version Compatible agent versions Not supported Java 5 Agent v1.3.0 to v2.21.7 v2.21.7 and lower Java 6 Agent v3.0.0 to v4.3.0 v4.3.0 and lower Java 7 Agent v3.0.0 to v6.5.0, v6.5.2, and v6.5.3 v4.9.0 and lower Java 8 Agent v3.10.0 to current v4.9.0 and lower Java 9 Agent v3.43.0 to current v4.9.0a and lower Java 10 Agent v4.4.0 to current v4.9.0 and lower Java 11 Agent v4.7.0 to current v4.9.0 and lower Java 12 Agent v4.12.0 to current NA Java 13 Agent v5.7.0 to current NA Java 14 Agent v5.11.0 to current NA Java 15 Agent v6.1.0 to current NA Java 16 Agent v7.3.0 to current NA Java 17 Agent v7.4.0 to current NA Compatible: IBM JVM versions 8 for Linux Eclipse OpenJ9 versions 8 to 13 for Linux, Windows, and macOS OpenJDK and AdoptOpenJDK JVM versions 8 to 16 for Linux, Windows, and macOS Oracle Hotspot JVM versions 8 to 16 for Linux, Solaris, Windows, and macOS Azul Zing JVM versions 8 and 11 for Linux, Windows, and macOS Azul Zulu JVM versions 8 to 12 for Linux, Windows, and macOS Amazon Corretto JVM versions 8 and 11 for Linux, Windows, and macOS Alibaba Dragonwell JVM versions 8 and 11 for Linux, Windows, and macOS (Java 1.7) Compatible only with Java agent 6.5.x [ ZIP | 16.8 MB] legacy agent: OpenJDK and AdoptOpenJDK JVM versions 7 IBM JVM version 7 Oracle Hotspot JVM version 7 for Linux, Solaris, Windows, macOS (Java 1.6) Compatible only with Java agent 4.3.x [ ZIP | 9.9 MB] legacy agent: Apple Hotspot JVM version 6 for macOS IBM JVM version 6 Oracle Hotspot JVM version 6.0 for Linux, Solaris, Windows, macOS (Java 1.5) Compatible only with Java agent 2.21.x [ ZIP | 2.8 MB] legacy agent: Oracle Hotspot JVM version 5.0 for Linux, Solaris, Windows, macOS (Java SE 5.0) Oracle JRockit up to and including 1.6.0_50 Security requirements As a standard security measure for data collection, your app server must support SHA-2 (256-bit). SHA-1 is not supported. Use of other monitoring software If your application uses other application monitoring software besides our agent, we cannot guarantee that our agent will work correctly and we cannot offer technical support. For more information, see Errors while using other monitoring software. Built-in instrumentation After you install the Java agent, it automatically instruments many popular frameworks and libraries. With automatic instrumentation, the agent collects rich data out of the box, and data will show up in your New Relic dashboards within minutes of installation. Even if your library is not automatically instrumented, you can still collect data with custom instrumentation and the Java agent API. The agent automatically instruments these frameworks and libraries: App/Web servers The agent automatically instruments the following app/web servers.

      "body": "NerdGraph is our GraphQL-format API that lets you query New Relic data and configure some New Relic features. After you sign up for a free New Relic account and install any of our monitoring services, you can get started with NerdGraph. What is NerdGraph? New Relic has several APIs. NerdGraph is the API we recommend for querying New Relic data and for performing some specific configurations (learn more about features). NerdGraph provides a single API interface for returning data from New Relic’s various APIs and microservices. Over time, other configuration capabilities will be added to NerdGraph. Important NerdGraph isn’t used for data ingest. For that, you'd use our data ingest APIs. NerdGraph is built using GraphQL, which is an open source API format that allows you to request exactly the data needed, with no over-fetching or under-fetching. For a lesson in how to use NerdGraph, watch this 7-minute video: Want to watch more video tutorials? Go to the New Relic University’s Intro to NerdGraph. Or see the online course on New Relic APIs. Use the GraphiQL explorer To get started using GraphQL, we recommend playing around with our GraphiQL explorer (GraphiQL is an open source graphical interface for using GraphQL). You can use it to explore our data schema, to read built-in object definitions, and to build and execute queries. To use GraphQL, you’ll need a user-specific New Relic API key called a user key. You can generate one or find an existing one from the GraphiQL explorer’s API key dropdown. To find the GraphiQL explorer: If your New Relic account uses an EU data center, go to api.eu.newrelic.com/graphiql. Otherwise use api.newrelic.com/graphiql. For tips on how to build queries, see Build queries. Requirements and endpoints To use NerdGraph, you need a New Relic user key, which can be generated and accessed from the GraphiQL explorer. The endpoints are: Main endpoint: https://api.newrelic.com/graphql Endpoint for accounts using EU data center: https://api.eu.newrelic.com/graphql To access the endpoint, use the following cURL command: curl -X POST https://api.newrelic.com/graphql \\ -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \\ -H 'API-Key: YOUR_NEW_RELIC_USER_KEY' \\ -d '{ \"query\": \"{ requestContext { userId apiKey } }\" } ' Copy What can you do with NerdGraph? NerdGraph functionality can be broken down into two main categories: Querying New Relic data. You can fetch data for a variety of purposes, including using it in a programmatic workflow, or building a New Relic One app for custom data visualizations. Configuring New Relic features. There are a variety of configurations available and more will be added over time. You can do things like add tags, configure workloads, or customize \"golden metrics.\" You can use NerdGraph to return a wide range of New Relic data but we’ve created some tutorials for common use cases: Topic Tutorials Your monitored entities Get data about entities Understand entity relationships and dependencies (used to build service maps) Query and configure \"golden metrics\" (important entity metrics) Querying data Query using NRQL (our query language) Tags Add and manage tags APM agents APM agent configuration Dashboards Create dashboards Export dashboards to other accounts Export dashboards as files Migrate from Insights Dashboard API to NerdGraph Alerts See all alert-related tutorials Applied Intelligence View and configure topology Workloads View and configure workloads Service Levels Configure and manage Service Levels Manage keys Create and manage keys (license keys used for data ingest, and user keys) Manage data Convert event data to metric data Drop data Distributed tracing Query distributed tracing data Configure Infinite Tracing New Relic One apps Build a New Relic One app Cloud integrations (AWS, Azure, GCP) Configure cloud integrations Partners and resellers Manage subscriptions (only for partners using original pricing model) Data partitions Manage data partitions Date retention Manage data retention NerdGraph terminology The following are terms that originate with GraphQL (the API format NerdGraph uses). Term Definition Queries and mutations There are two classes of GraphQL operations: Queries are basic requests used only to fetch data. These queries are not static, meaning that you can ask for more data or less data, depending on your needs. For each query, you can specify exactly what data you want to retrieve, as long as it is supported by the schema. Mutations are requests that perform an action, such as creating a resource or changing configuration. Mutations require the keyword mutation, as well as the name of the mutation. Type Data in GraphQL is organized into types. Types can be scalars (like strings, numbers, or booleans) or object types. An object type is a custom type made up of a collection of fields. For example, an object type called User may represent a user in a system. Field A field represents a piece of information on an object type that can be queried. Fields can be scalars, lists, or objects. For example, a User object type could have a string field called name. Interface An interface is an abstract type that represents a collection of common fields that other object types can implement. Tips on using the GraphiQL explorer You can make queries with the NerdGraph GraphiQL explorer. The explorer provides built-in schema definitions and features, including auto-complete and query validation. Query accounts a New Relic user can access You can query for the name of an account that an actor (a New Relic authorized user) has access to: query { actor { account(id: YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID) { name } } } Copy The response will mirror the query structure you defined in the request, making it easy to ask for the specific data that you want. { \"data\": { \"actor\": { \"account\": { \"name\": \"Data Nerd\" } } } } Copy Query user, account, and NRQL in one request The graph structure shows its capabilities when queries become more complex. For example, you can query for user information, account information, and make a NRQL query with one request. With REST API, this would take three different requests to three different endpoints. query { actor { account(id: YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID) { name nrql(query: \"SELECT * FROM Transaction\") { results } } user { name id } } } Copy",

      "body": "With NerdGraph, you can query details about your monitored entities. Important To work with an entity's golden metrics and tags, see the golden metrics API tutorial. Entity definition Entities are an important New Relic concept: we define an entity as anything we monitor. This includes (but is not limited to): Applications monitored by APM. Cloud integrations, services, and hosts monitored by our infrastructure monitoring. To view entity details in the UI, you can use the Explorer. When working with entities in NerdGraph, it's important to keep in mind that: A unique entity GUID identifies an entity. An entity exists over a span of time, even if it's a short period. An entity provides a useful entry point for exploring data about specific metrics and events, or for contextualizing data related to other entities. Requirements To use entities, you need a user key. Search for entities New Relic searches for entities by their attributes, primarily their name, but also by type of entity and other values. The search returns basic data about entities matching the search criteria. Then, from the basic query results, you can query a specific entity by its GUID. Besides domainType, other common entity attributes are: id accountId name domainId alertSeverity reporting You can filter by any of the above attributes. Additionally, you can use tags for filtering too. Caution You cannot filter by custom, root-level entity properties. Custom properties are only retrieved as part of the entity’s metadata in the actual search response. To filter by a custom field, transform it into an entity tag. You can craft a query in one of two ways: Use the queryBuilder argument to help you craft a query. Use the freeform query argument to build your own search. To use NerdGraph to query one or more entities, you can search by attribute or GUID. In addition to the examples below, we highly recommend exploring the API using the NerdGraph GraphiQL explorer, and benefiting from its inline documentation. Search with queryBuilder The queryBuilder argument is useful to construct simple queries. It allows you to add filters to your query from a predefined list of attributes, and their typical values. For more advanced queries, use the query argument instead. Go to the NerdGraph GraphiQL explorer. Run a basic query to find entities that match your search criteria. For example: { actor { entitySearch( queryBuilder : {domain: APM, type: APPLICATION}) { query results { entities { name entityType guid } } } } } Copy Search with freeform query This is useful to craft more complex queries. Go to the NerdGraph GraphiQL explorer. Run a basic query to find entities that match your search criteria. For example: query($query: String! ) { actor { entitySearch(query: $query) { count results { entities { name entityType guid } } } } } Copy Add the following variables to the Query variables section in NerdGraph: {\"query\": \"name LIKE 'nerd-graph' AND domainType IN ('APM-APPLICATION')\"} Copy Fetch entities by GUID When you know the GUID of the entity you want to fetch, you can just use the entity attribute: { actor { entity(guid: \"MTAwNDc5MzZ8QVBNfEFQUExJQ0FUSU9OfDExNzA0Mjk3\") { name entityType } } } Copy This can also be written as a search query: { actor { entitySearch(query: \"id = 'MTAwNDc5MzZ8QVBNfEFQUExJQ0FUSU9OfDExNzA0Mjk3'\") { query results { entities { name entityType } } } } } Copy Or, to fetch multiple entities at the same time, you can use the entities attribute: { actor { entities(guids: [\"MTAwNDc5MzZ8QVBNfEFQUExJQ0FUSU9OfDExNzA0Mjk3\", \"MTAwNDc5MzZ8QVBNfEFQUExJQ0FUSU9OfDExNzA0MTM3\"]) { name entityType } } } Copy Otherwise, use a search query: { actor { entitySearch(query: \"id in ('MTAwNDc5MzZ8QVBNfEFQUExJQ0FUSU9OfDExNzA0Mjk3', 'MTAwNDc5MzZ8QVBNfEFQUExJQ0FUSU9OfDExNzA0MTM3')\") { query results { entities { name entityType } } } } } Copy Example queries Queries are requests that are intended to only fetch data (and don't have any other effect). NerdGraph queries are not static, meaning that you can ask for more or less data depending on your needs. For each query, you can specify exactly what data you want to retrieve, as long as it's supported by the schema. Entities in NerdGraph rely on GraphQL interfaces, a concept that allows objects to share common fields. Interfaces are used to provide data for specific entity types, as you will see in many of these NerdGraph query examples. Get entity data using queryBuilder If you aren't sure how to start crafting an entity search query, use NerdGraph to help you build one. Next, retrieve entity data and the query string that was built. Request the query field in your results to see the query string built by the queryBuilder argument. You cannot use the query and queryBuilder arguments at the same time. We highly recommend exploring the API using the NerdGraph GraphiQL explorer, and using its inline documentation to see the query options available to you. { actor { entitySearch( queryBuilder : {domain: APM, type: APPLICATION}) { query results { entities { reporting ... on AlertableEntityOutline { alertSeverity } } } } } } Copy Get data for infrastructure integration entities in search results There are many different types of Infrastructure integration entities and they are listed separately from other entity types. Use the infrastructureIntegrationType input argument to explore them. You cannot use the query and queryBuilder arguments at the same time. Use infrastructureIntegrationType in place of the type input argument. We highly recommend exploring the API using the NerdGraph GraphiQL explorer and using its inline documentation to see the query options available to you. { actor { entitySearch(queryBuilder: { infrastructureIntegrationType : F5_NODE}) { query results { entities { entityType domain } } } } } Copy Get alert information on alertable entities in search results Fetch the alert severity of any entity that can be monitored by New Relic's alerts. This NerdGraph query will tell you if we are currently receiving data from your application (using the reporting field). If the entity is an alertable type, results will include the alert severity of the entity. If the results include entities that are not alertable, they will not include the AlertableEntityOutline fields. { actor { entitySearch(query: \"name like 'nerdgraph' and alertSeverity is not null\") { results { entities { reporting ... on AlertableEntityOutline { alertSeverity } } } } } } Copy Get summary data on APM entities in search results Different entity types have specific data associated with them. The following NerdGraph query example shows a selection of fields available for APM application entities: More summary data can be requested in your query. If entities of other types are returned in your search results, they will not include these fields. { actor { entitySearch(query: \"name like 'nerdgraph' and domainType = 'APM-APPLICATION'\") { results { entities { name ... on ApmApplicationEntityOutline { apmSummary { errorRate apdexScore webResponseTimeAverage responseTimeAverage } } } } } } } Copy Get data specific to each entity type in search results Different entity types have specific data associated with them. This NerdGraph query example requests the name for all entities regardless of which entity type they are, as well as the error rate for APM, browser monitoring, and mobile entities. If entities of other types are returned in your search results, they will not include an error rate field. { actor { entitySearch(query: \"name like 'nerdgraph'\") { results { entities { name ... on ApmApplicationEntityOutline { apmSummary { errorRate } } ... on BrowserApplicationEntityOutline { browserSummary { jsErrorRate } } ... on MobileApplicationEntityOutline { mobileSummary { httpErrorRate } } } } } } } Copy Get all tags for each entity in search results This NerdGraph query example fetches tags for every entity returned in the search results. For more information, see the NerdGraph GraphiQL tagging tutorial. { actor { entitySearch(query: \"name like 'nerdgraph'\") { results { entities { name tags { key values } } } } } } Copy Use tags to filter entity results This NerdGraph query example filters entities that belong to the INFRA domain and belong to awsRegion us-east-1, and returns their name in the search results. { actor { entitySearch(query: \"domain = 'INFRA' and tags.aws.awsRegion = 'us-east-1'\") { results { entities { name } } } } } Copy Additionally, filtering can be done by whether a given tag is present. The following query filters entities of the domainType BROWSER-APPLICATION and have the tag clusterAgentId defined. { actor { entitySearch(query: \"domainType = 'BROWSER-APPLICATION' and tags.clusterAgentId is not null\") { results { entities { name } } } } } Copy For more information, see the NerdGraph GraphiQL tagging tutorial. Aggregate results by an attribute or a tag This NerdGraph query example filters entities of domainType APM-APPLICATION domain that belong to awsRegion us-east-1, and returns their name in the search results. Then aggregates results to get the total number of entities grouped by New Relic account id. { actor { entitySearch(query: \"domainType = 'APM-APPLICATION'\") { facetedCounts(facets: {facetCriterion: {facet: ACCOUNT_ID}}) { counts { count facet } } } } } Copy Additionally, aggregation can be done by tags too; the following query filters entities of domainType APM-APPLICATION domain that belong to awsRegion us-east-1, then aggregates results to get the total number of entities grouped by Agent language. { actor { entitySearch(query: \"domainType = 'APM-APPLICATION' and tags.aws.awsRegion = 'us-east-1'\") { facetedCounts(facets: {facetCriterion: {tag: \"language\"}}) { counts { count facet } } } } } Copy For more information, see the NerdGraph GraphiQL tagging tutorial. Get the nextCursor for paginated search results The NerdGraph GraphiQL explorer paginates results from an entity search. If your search criteria yields more than the API limit and you want to view the rest of the results, you can request nextCursor in your initial request, and use its value in another query to retrieve the following \"page\" of results. If there are no more results, nextCursor will be null. { actor { entitySearch(query: \"name like 'nerd-graph'\") { results { nextCursor entities { name } } } } } Copy Use the value of nextCursor in your next search: { actor { entitySearch(query: \"name like 'nerd-graph'\") { results(cursor: \"next_cursor_value\") { nextCursor entities { name } } } } } Copy Delete entities You can manually delete any entity in your account by using the NerdGraph API. To do so, run this query with the entity's GUID in the NerdGraph GraphiQL explorer: mutation { entityDelete(guids: [\"EntityGuid\"]) { deletedEntities failures } } Copy Important Currently, you can only remove the following entity types using the Nerdgraph API: APM-APPLICATION, EXT-SERVICE, and REF-REPOSITORY. You may see a deleted entity in your UI if a New Relic agent reindexes it again.",

      "body": "This page outlines the options for management of the ktranslate container used by New Relic NPM. Container requirements We recommend the following resources for the ktranslate container image: Disk 100MB available disk space CPU SNMP Polling/Trap Collection: 1 CPU core dedicated for every ~1,000 devices Device Flow Collection: 1 CPU core dedicated for every ~2,000 flows per second (fps) Syslog Message Collection: 1 CPU core dedicated for every ~2,000 messages per second Memory ktranslate is not generally constrained by memory resources. The amount of memory on your host should be driven by the types of applications/containers you plan to run. For a general idea, we commonly see success with image sizes as small as the AWS t2.micro which has 1 vCPU and 1.0 GB of available RAM. Tip The ktranslate container image runs a single \"job type\" at a time. For instance, a container deployed for SNMP polling and trap collection will not be used for flow collection. Furthermore, containers deployed for flow collection are limited to a single -nf.source type per container. This means that it is common to have multiple containers deployed to a single Docker host at any given time. They can also share a common configuration file, but do not have to. Updating the container Keeping the ktranslate container image up to date is good practice to both receive the latest updates and resolve common problems through various bug fixes applied during the development lifecycle. It is recommended to always pull the latest available image when redeploying your containers. Pull the latest container image available bash Copy $ docker pull kentik/ktranslate:v2 Collect the IDs and names of any existing containers bash Copy $ docker ps -a --filter ancestor=kentik/ktranslate:v2 --format \"{{.ID}} - {{.Names}}\" Output Example: 3297b134a352 - ktranslate-snmp 4962a854b386 - ktranslate-sflow Copy Remove any pre-existing containers bash Copy $ docker rm -f $CONTAINER_ID Redeploy your ktranslate container using the original settings you deployed with from either SNMP, flow data, or syslog collection. Important The configuration file used by ktranslate is applied to the container at runtime. Changes to this file require you to remove and restart your running container(s) to apply the edits. Container runtime options Below are the various options available during Docker runtime for the ktranslate container image: Option name Type Required Description -snmp Flag ✓ Sets the path to the snmp-base.yaml file on the Docker container, based on the volume mount from the Docker host passed as an option during runtime. -nr_account_id Flag ✓ The New Relic One account ID that ktranslate will ship data to. -log_level Flag Overrides the default info log level for ktranslate. The available options are debug, info, warn, or error. -snmp_discovery Flag Used to setup the container in SNMP discovery mode. -tee_logs Flag Forwards Docker logs from ktranslate into New Relic One Logs. -metrics=jchf Flag Forwards health metrics from ktranslate into New Relic One. -service_name Flag Appended to the container name in Docker logs to help isolate logs from various containers in New Relic One Logs. -nr_region Flag Sets the regional API endpoints for ktranslate to forward telemetry to New Relic One. Options are US, EU, and GOV (FedRAMP). -max_threads Flag Lets you process higher volumes of data. We recommend one CPU core available for every 2,000 flows per second (fps) of network flow data sent, or every 1,000 SNMP devices being monitored, or every 2,000 syslog messages per second collected by a container. The default is 1. -sample_rate Flag Changes the default sample rate value at which flows are passed to New Relic One Events. This does not speed up the local configuration of flow sample rate on a device, but it can slow it down. Setting this to 1 will enable capturing all flows sent to the container. The default is 1000. -nf.workers Flag Overrides the number of workers used in processing network packets. Use one worker for every 4,000 of flows per second (fps) of network flow data sent. The default is 1. -nf.port Flag Overrides the listening port for incoming flow packets. The default is 9995. -nf.source Flag ✓ (For flow containers) Sets up the type of flow this container will process. Options are ipfix, netflow5, netflow9, and sflow. -application_map Flag Sets the path to an application map file on the Docker container, based on a volume mount from the Docker host passed as an option during runtime. -dns Flag Sets the IP:Port for ktranslate to use during DNS resolution of IP addresses. Setting this affects the results for the dst_host and src_host fields. nr1.flow Argument ✓ (For flow containers) This argument statically sets the following flags: compression: gzip, sink: new_relic, format: new_relic, max_before_sample: 100, flow_only:true. nr1.snmp Argument ✓ (For SNMP containers) This argument statically sets the following options: compression: gzip, sink: new_relic, format: new_relic_metric, max_flows_per_message: 100. nr1.syslog Argument ✓ (For syslog containers) This argument statically sets the following flags: compression: gzip, sink: new_relic, format: new_relic_metric, syslog:\"0.0.0.0:5143\". NEW_RELIC_API_KEY Environment Variable ✓ Environment variable that must be used during Docker runtime to hold the New Relic license key for ktranslate to send data to the New Relic APIs. Ex: -e NEW_RELIC_API_KEY=$LICENSE_KEY. HTTPS_PROXY Environment Variable Environment variable that can be used during Docker runtime to setup ktranslate to ship data to New Relic via proxy. Ex: -e HTTPS_PROXY=https://user:password@hostname:port.",

      "body": "Profiles define what SNMP OIDs we want to collect and send to your New Relic account. This document explains how to modify an existing profile or create a new profile. Get started If you've decided to build a custom profile or modify one of our open source profiles, you need a few essential tools: A GitHub account: This enables you to raise issues and contribute changes to Kentik's open source profiles. An SNMP walk from a network device where you want to work on a profile. For more information, see our documentation on setting up SNMP and using snmpwalk. Permissions to perform Docker pull on the server that hosts your ktranslate container. This document covers: Making requests for new or modified profiles through GitHub to be worked on by the maintainers Contributing your own profiles and modifications publicly Using custom profiles privately Tip Support for all things relating to kentik/snmp-profiles is handled through GitHub issues. New Relic technical support is not able to provide any additional help beyond redirecting you back to raise an issue there. Make requests through GitHub This is the most common and simple scenario, for cases where you don't have the time or expertise with SNMP to do these yourself. After you provide the relevant data, our team will build the profile for you. Log into GitHub and go to the snmp-profiles repo. Click the Issues tab near the top. Click New issue. To request a new profile, look for the SNMP Profile Request section, and click Get started. Provide all requested information in the template, such as the device vendor, model, snmp object identifier, and a sanitized SNMP walk. For all other requests, use Open a blank issue. Tip Providing an SNMP walk is critical as we cannot do any work on the profile without these. This is not the same as an MIB file. The maintainers of the repo will review the information you provided and, if there is anything missing, they will follow up with you. Once all the necessary data is provided, they will add it to the queue of profiles to be built. After it is added to the repo, the issue will be closed, and all you have to do is update the ktranslate docker container on your end, and the newest profiles will automatically be loaded. Contribute profiles and modifications publicly We gladly accept contributions from anyone who wants to help out to either create new profiles or improve the existing profiles. To familiarize yourself with the structure of a profile, review this highly commented template.yml on GitHub. Log into GitHub and go to the snmp-profiles repo. To create a copy of the same information in your account, click the fork button near the top. Within your fork,make necessary changes to the files, or create new vendor directories and profiles as needed. Be sure to pass your profile through a YAML validator, such as codebeautify, before submitting a pull request. When you are done with your changes, submit a pull request to the upstream repo. The maintainers will review the change, and discuss any necessary feedback. When everyone is aligned, it will be merged. Shortly after a merge, new SNMP profiles are automatically available by pulling the new version of the Docker image and launching a new container in your environment. For more information, see our documentation about SNMP manual setup. Tip Be sure to sync your fork regularly to keep it up to date with changes in the upstream repo. What kinds of OIDs should I actually include in a profile? In many cases SNMP offers a lot of data, but much of that data does not provide actionable information. Or, the data provides value that is so uncommon and low impact, it might not be worth bringing into your New Relic account. You want to focus on collecting data that lets you know if there is anything that would stop the device from being able to perform whatever functions you expect it to perform. Building on from that, you should collect measurements that tell you how well it is performing those functions. Example 1: For a device operating as a VPN concentrator, we would collect high-level system metrics like: CPU and memory utilization Hardware sensor information to make sure that the device isn't going to shut itself down due to things like fan failures OIDs that tell us about the aggregated connections and throughput Example 2: An example of data that is available but provides very poor value is an OID table that lists all the running processes on a network appliance. Coming from a server admin perspective, that might sound useful, but since this is an appliance, you normally do not have the capability or the need to do anything with the processes that run inside it. Polling and storing tables with hundreds of items that you can't actually do anything with would not be efficient. Use custom profiles privately For cases where you want to make a change to a profile, but you know that it is a scenario that is very unique and would not apply to other customers you can locally edit the profiles. The way this is done is by using Docker's volume mount to pass in your customized files to the ktranslate container inside the etc/ktranslate/profiles/ directory. There are other ways you could accomplish this but in this example we will demonstrate using a git fork and clone. Ensure you are in the directory you want to keep the files in, then clone your fork of the GitHub repo to your Docker host: git clone https://github.com/<YourGitUser>/snmp-profiles.git Copy Get the command you would normally use to launch the SNMP container, and add a second volume mount argument after the one where we passed in the snmp-base.yaml. -v `pwd`/snmp-profiles/profiles:/etc/ktranslate/profiles \\ Copy The mount command replaces the built-in profiles directory with your customized data. The end result will be be similar to this: docker run -ti --name ktranslate-discovery --rm --net=host \\ --user `id -u`:`id -g` \\ -v `pwd`/snmp-base.yaml:/snmp-base.yaml \\ -v `pwd`/snmp-profiles/profiles:/etc/ktranslate/profiles \\ kentik/ktranslate:v2 \\ -snmp /snmp-base.yaml \\ -log_level info \\ -snmp_discovery=true Copy Tip Be sure to pass your custom version of the profiles in every time you launch a discovery container or SNMP polling container. If you don't use it consistently for all SNMP instances sets, this can cause unreliable behavior.",

This array is evaluated in order and discovery accepts the first passing community. For SNMPv3, set it to default_v3 default_v3 SNMPv3 configuration to scan during SNMP polling use_snmp_v1 Indicates whether to use SNMPv1 during discovery. By default, it's set to false add_devices ✓ Indicates whether to add discovered devices to the devices section of the snmp-base.yaml file. By default, it's set to true add_mibs ✓ Indicates whether to add discovered MIBs to the global.mibs_enabled section of the snmp-base.yaml file. By default, it's set to true replace_devices ✓ Indicates whether to replace discovered devices if they already exist in the devices section of the snmp-base.yaml file. By default, it's set to true no_dedup_engine_id Indicates whether to deduplicate discovered devices if it appears that they are the same device being discovered on multiple IP addresses. By default, it's set to false debug Indicates whether to enable debug level logging during discovery. By default, it's set to false threads ✓ Integer limit of threads to use during discovery. It must be less than the number of cores available to the container Global section Option name Required Description poll_time_sec ✓ Time in seconds to poll devices. By default, it's set to 60 timeout_ms ✓ Time in milliseconds queries timeout. By default, it's set to 5000 retries ✓ Number of attempts to retry failed polls. By default, it's set to 0 mibs_enabled ✓ Array of all active MIBs the ktranslate docker image will poll. Polling only occurs if the MIB is valid for a given device drop_if_outside_poll Indicates whether to drop all values from this cycle if polling takes longer than the value set in poll_time_sec. By default, it's set to false mib_profile_dir Directory to find curated MIB profiles SNMPv3 optional configuration Here's an example of SNMPv3 configuration section for the snmp-base.yaml file: yaml default_v3: user_name: userNamev3 authentication_protocol: MD5 authentication_passphrase: authPassPrivacy privacy_protocol: AES256 privacy_passphrase: passPrivacy Copy Option name Required Description user_name ✓ User name for SNMPv3 authentication authentication_protocol ✓ SNMPv3 authentication protocol. The possible values are NoAuth, MD5, or SHA authentication_passphrase SNMPv3 authentication passphrase privacy_protocol ✓ SNMPv3 privacy protocol. The possible values are AuthNoPriv, DES, AES, AES192, AES256, AES192C, or AES256C privacy_passphrase SNMPv3 privacy passphrase context_engine_id SNMPv3 context engine ID context_name SNMPv3 context name The flow_only attribute There are several supported configurations available for running ktranslate against devices for both SNMP and network flow data collection. The flow_only attribute on both a ktranslate docker container level and in the devices section of the snmp-base.yaml file allows you to get different results: If you have multiple containers collecting both SNMP and network flow data with the ktranslate docker image, define your devices in the snmp-base.yaml file, following the standards for SNMP data polling. They will be automatically matched to their respective flows based on their device_ip matching the sampling IP for the flow device. For network flow data devices, run the ktranslate docker image with the -flow_only=true option. snmp-base.yaml file - No setting changes needed If you have multiple containers collecting both SNMP and network flow data with the ktranslate docker image, and you have specific devices where you only want network flow or SNMP data collection and no SNMP or network flow data polling respectively, you can set them up in their respective device configuration section in the snmp-base.yaml file. For network flow data devices, run the ktranslate docker image with the -flow_only=true option. snmp-base.yaml file - Change the flow_only to true: flow_only: true Copy Advanced options for running the ktranslate docker image In this table you can find additional options you can use with the ktranslate docker image. Option name Description -max_threads Lets you process higher volumes of flow. We recommend one CPU core available for every 2,000 flows per second (fps) of network flow data sent. -sample_rate=100 Changes the default sample rate value at which flows are passed to New Relic One Events. It also sets the sample rate value for flow types that don't have a default sample rate value. -nf.workers=1 Overrides the number of workers used in processing udp packets. Use one worker for every 4,000 of flows per second (fps) of network flow data sent. -nf.port Overrides the default 9995 listening port for incoming flow packets. -listen Overrides the default 8082 port used by ktranslate to expose health metrics. You must use this option when running multiple ktranslate containers on a single host. -metalisten Overrides the default 8083 port used by ktranslate to expose metadata. You must use this option when running multiple ktranslate containers on a single host. -metrics=jchf Forwards health metrics from ktranslate into New Relic One. -log_level Overrides the default info log level for ktranslate. The available options are debug, info, warn, or error. -tee_logs Forwards logs from ktranslate into New Relic One Logs. HTTPS_PROXY Environment variable that can be used during Docker runtime to setup ktranslate to ship data to New Relic via proxy. Ex: -e HTTPS_PROXY=https://user:password@hostname:port You can also run several ktranslate images to monitor different network flow types simultaneously. See the follwing example: bash Copy $ docker run -d --name ktranslate-sflow --net=host \\ > -e NEW_RELIC_API_KEY=$INSERT_API_KEY \\ > kentik/ktranslate:v2 \\ > -snmp /snmp-base.yaml \\ > -nr_account_id=$NR_ACCOUNT_ID \\ > -metrics=jchf \\ > -log_level=info \\ > -tee_logs=true \\ > -nf.source=sflow \\ > -nf.port=9996 \\ > -max_threads=1 \\ > -listen 0.0.0.0:8084 \\ > -metalisten 0.0.0.0:8085 \\ > nr1.flow $ $ $ docker run -d --name ktranslate-netflow9 --net=host \\ > -e NEW_RELIC_API_KEY=$INSERT_API_KEY \\ > kentik/ktranslate:v2 \\ > -snmp /snmp-base.yaml \\ > -nr_account_id=$NR_ACCOUNT_ID \\ > -metrics=jchf \\ > -log_level=info \\ > -tee_logs=true \\ > -nf.source=netflow9 \\ > -nf.port=2055 \\ > -max_threads=2 \\ > -listen 0.0.0.0:8086 \\ > -metalisten 0.0.0.0:8087 \\ > nr1.flow Logs sent with Network performance monitoring If you want to check the logs locally, run docker logs ktranslate-snmp. The -tee_logs=true option sends logs to New Relic One when polling devices. To see them, do the following: Go to one.newrelic.com > Logs. In Find logs where enter collector.name:\"ktranslate\" and click Query logs. Tip If you want to filter out all the information messages, enter collector.name:\"ktranslate\" message:-*\\[Info\\]*. Metrics sent with Network performance monitoring The -metrics option captures one of the following performance metrics when polling devices: Metric Description baseserver_healthcheck_execution_total Rate of internal health checks. Shows mostly that things are not deadlocked. delivery_metrics_nr Rate of metrics sent to New Relic One. delivery_logs_nr Rate of logs sent to New Relic One. delivery_wins_nr Rate of 200 HTTP codes received from sending metrics and events to New Relic One. device_metrics Rate of SNMP polling of device level metrics. inputq Messages per second (msg/sec) recieved over the last 60 seconds from SNMP or network flow devices. interface_metrics Rate of SNMP polling of interface level metrics. jchfq Gauge rate with number of available pre-allocated buffers. It should be 8,000 aproximately. To see these metrics in New Relic One: Go to one.newrelic.com and click Query your data. Enter the following NRQL query: FROM Metric SELECT latest(kentik.ktranslate.chf.kkc.baseserver_healthcheck_execution_total) AS 'baseserver_healthcheck_execution_total', latest(kentik.ktranslate.chf.kkc.delivery_metrics_nr) AS 'delivery_metrics_nr', latest(kentik.ktranslate.chf.kkc.delivery_logs_nr) AS 'delivery_logs_nr', latest(kentik.ktranslate.chf.kkc.delivery_wins_nr) AS 'delivery_wins_nr', latest(kentik.ktranslate.chf.kkc.device_metrics) AS 'device_metrics', latest(kentik.ktranslate.chf.kkc.inputq) AS 'inputq', latest(kentik.ktranslate.chf.kkc.interface_metrics) AS 'interface_metrics', latest(kentik.ktranslate.chf.kkc.jchfq) AS 'jchfq' WHERE provider = 'kentik-agent' AND instrumentation.name = 'heartbeat' LIMIT MAX Copy",

The possible values are AuthNoPriv, DES, AES, AES192, AES256, AES192C, or AES256C privacy_passphrase SNMPv3 privacy passphrase context_engine_id SNMPv3 context engine ID context_name SNMPv3 context name Tip You can use AWS Secrets Manager natively in your SNMP v3 config using the aws.sm.$SECRET_NAME syntax, replacing $SECRET_NAME as necessary to have ktranslate pull in your credentials during Docker runtime. Optional external config files To support a wide variety of configuration and automation needs, you can use external files that you volume mount into your Docker container to decouple certain elements of the standard configuration file. The syntax for these files is \"@fileName.extension\", including the double quotes. Discovery CIDRs Example: discovery: cidrs: \"@cidrs.yaml\" Copy The CIDRs file should use a YAML list syntax like this: - 10.10.0.0/24 - 10.20.0.0/24 - 192.168.0.21/32 Copy Devices Example: devices: - \"@neteng-devices.yaml\" - \"@dc-ops.yaml\" Copy The device files should use the same syntax as the standard devices section of the main config file, omitting the optional fields that are generated during discovery: devices: # Sample of SNMP v2c device ups_snmpv2c__10.10.0.201: device_name: ups_snmpv2c device_ip: 10.10.0.201 snmp_comm: public oid: .1.3.6.1.4.1.318.1.3.27 mib_profile: apc_ups.yml provider: kentik-ups poll_time_sec: 300 retries: 1 timeout_ms: 5000 user_tags: owning_team: dc_ops Copy The match_attributes attribute To support filtering of data that does not create value for your observability needs, you can set the global.match_attributes.{} and/or devices.<deviceName>.match_attributes.{} attribute map. This will provide filtering at the ktranslate level, before shipping data to New Relic, giving you granular control over monitoring of things like interfaces. The default behavior of this map is an OR condition, but you can override this and force an AND operator by prefixing your key name with !. This is also useful to return only matched items and omit all null and \"\" (empty) results. Default 'OR' with null and empty values Match when if_Alias begins with Uplink OR when if_interface_name begins with Gig, keep all null and \"\" values: devices: deviceName: ... match_attributes: if_Alias: \"^Uplink.*\" if_interface_name: \"^Gig.*\" Copy 'AND', omit null and empty values Match when if_Alias begins with Uplink AND when if_interface_name begins with Gig, drop all null and \"\" values: devices: deviceName: ... match_attributes: if_Alias: \"^Uplink.*\" \"!if_interface_name\": \"^Gig.*\" Copy Single match, omit null and empty values Match when if_Alias begins with Uplink, drop all null and \"\" values: devices: deviceName: ... match_attributes: \"!if_Alias\": \"^Uplink.*\" Copy The flow_only attribute To support monitoring of devices where performance statistics are nor accessible, available, or desired, you can set the devices.<deviceName>.flow_only attribute to true. This will generate a Flow Device entity in New Relic One which will only have telemetry in the KFlow event namespace. Alternatively, collecting flow telemetry from a device that is in your configuration file as an SNMP device will add decoration of the KFlow data to the pre-existing entity, such as a Router or Firewall. In New Relic One, you can see the results of this polling by investigating the following events: FROM KFlow SELECT count(*) FACET device_name WHERE instrumentation.name = 'netflow-events' TIMESERIES Copy The response_time and ping_only attributes To support monitoring of devices where performance statistics are not accessible or available, or in simple cases where basic round-trip time (RTT) monitoring is required, you can either set the global.response_time or devices.<deviceName>.ping_only attributes to true. This feature uses the go-ping package to send unprivileged UDP packets to devices in order to collect the average, min, and max RTT for the endpoint based on sending 1 packet/sec from ktranslate to the device IP address. Setting the global.response_time attribute to true will add RTT monitoring on top of existing SNMP polling. devices.<deviceName>.ping_only: true will allow you to monitor devices with only the UDP packets for RTT and no SNMP polling. In New Relic One, you can see the results of this polling by investigating the following metrics: FROM Metric SELECT average(kentik.ping.AvgRttMs) AS 'Average', max(kentik.ping.MaxRttMs) AS 'Max', min(kentik.ping.MinRttMs) AS 'Min' FACET device_name TIMESERIES Copy Tip You can use the ping_only attribute in replacement of the flow_only attribute if you would like to collect RTT metrics from a flow device. If both ping_only and flow_only are true, the device will be treated as a flow_only device. Flow data application mapping By default, flow telemetry is mapped to known applications based on evaluation of the layer 4 port in use on a specific flow conversation. If needed, you can override the default mapping by providing a YAML file during Docker runtime to the -application_map flag. This will allow you to specify application names based on ports you identify. Example syntax: applications: - ports: [9092, 9093] name: kafka - ports: [80, 8080] name: http - ports: [443, 8443] name: https Copy Flow data input filtering By default, flow data containers will collect and process every flow packet they receive. If needed, you can add an inclusion filter to the -nf.source flag that will ignore all traffic not matching the filter you provide. Syntax: --filters $TYPE,$FIELD,$FUNCTION,$MATCH Argument Name Required Description $TYPE ✓ The type of filter to apply.

If you need to use the default syslog port of 514 (or any other port), you can do so by providing a new listening endpoint during Docker runtime. For example: -syslog=\"0.0.0.0:514. Set up network syslog monitoring in New Relic One From a Linux host with Docker installed, download the ktranslate image from dockerhub by running bash Copy $ docker pull kentik/ktranslate:v2 Copy the snmp-base.yaml file to the local $HOME directory of your Docker user, and discard the container by running bash Copy $ cd . $ id=$(docker create kentik/ktranslate:v2) $ docker cp $id:/etc/ktranslate/snmp-base.yaml . $ docker rm -v $id In the snmp-base.yaml file, add your network syslog devices inside the devices key with the following structure: devices: syslogDevice: device_name: edge-router device_ip: 10.10.1.254 ping_only: true # Optional user tags user_tags: owning_team: net_eng environment: production Copy Tip If you're already monitoring SNMP data devices that send network syslog, you don't need to add them in your snmp-base.yaml file a second time. The ping_only attribute used in the configuration file can optionally be replaced with flow_only to remove response time monitoring and only collect syslog messages from the host. Run ktranslate to listen for network syslog by running: bash Copy $ docker run -d --name ktranslate-syslog --restart unless-stopped --net=host \\ > -v `pwd`/snmp-base.yaml:/snmp-base.yaml \\ > -e NEW_RELIC_API_KEY=$YOUR_NR_LICENSE_KEY \\ > kentik/ktranslate:v2 \\ > -snmp /snmp-base.yaml \\ > -nr_account_id=$YOUR_NR_ACCOUNT_ID \\ > ## If your account is located in Europe, add the following option: $ ## -nr_region=EU \\ $ -metrics=jchf \\ > -tee_logs=true \\ > -service_name=syslog \\ > ## Optional: To override the default listening port of \"0.0.0.0:5143\": $ ## -syslog=\"<ip_address>:<port>\" $ nr1.syslog Tip ktranslate handles syslog in the following formats: RFC3164, RFC5424, and RFC6587.

      "body": "This page outlines the options for management of the ktranslate container used by New Relic NPM. Container requirements We recommend the following resources for the ktranslate container image: Disk 100MB available disk space CPU SNMP Polling/Trap Collection: 1 CPU core dedicated for every ~1,000 devices Device Flow Collection: 1 CPU core dedicated for every ~2,000 flows per second (fps) Syslog Message Collection: 1 CPU core dedicated for every ~2,000 messages per second Memory ktranslate is not generally constrained by memory resources. The amount of memory on your host should be driven by the types of applications/containers you plan to run. For a general idea, we commonly see success with image sizes as small as the AWS t2.micro which has 1 vCPU and 1.0 GB of available RAM. Tip The ktranslate container image runs a single \"job type\" at a time. For instance, a container deployed for SNMP polling and trap collection will not be used for flow collection. Furthermore, containers deployed for flow collection are limited to a single -nf.source type per container. This means that it is common to have multiple containers deployed to a single Docker host at any given time. They can also share a common configuration file, but do not have to. Updating the container Keeping the ktranslate container image up to date is good practice to both receive the latest updates and resolve common problems through various bug fixes applied during the development lifecycle. It is recommended to always pull the latest available image when redeploying your containers. Pull the latest container image available bash Copy $ docker pull kentik/ktranslate:v2 Collect the IDs and names of any existing containers bash Copy $ docker ps -a --filter ancestor=kentik/ktranslate:v2 --format \"{{.ID}} - {{.Names}}\" Output Example: 3297b134a352 - ktranslate-snmp 4962a854b386 - ktranslate-sflow Copy Remove any pre-existing containers bash Copy $ docker rm -f $CONTAINER_ID Redeploy your ktranslate container using the original settings you deployed with from either SNMP, flow data, or syslog collection. Important The configuration file used by ktranslate is applied to the container at runtime. Changes to this file require you to remove and restart your running container(s) to apply the edits. Container runtime options Below are the various options available during Docker runtime for the ktranslate container image: Option name Type Required Description -snmp Flag ✓ Sets the path to the snmp-base.yaml file on the Docker container, based on the volume mount from the Docker host passed as an option during runtime. -nr_account_id Flag ✓ The New Relic One account ID that ktranslate will ship data to. -log_level Flag Overrides the default info log level for ktranslate. The available options are debug, info, warn, or error. -snmp_discovery Flag Used to setup the container in SNMP discovery mode. -tee_logs Flag Forwards Docker logs from ktranslate into New Relic One Logs. -metrics=jchf Flag Forwards health metrics from ktranslate into New Relic One. -service_name Flag Appended to the container name in Docker logs to help isolate logs from various containers in New Relic One Logs. -nr_region Flag Sets the regional API endpoints for ktranslate to forward telemetry to New Relic One. Options are US, EU, and GOV (FedRAMP). -max_threads Flag Lets you process higher volumes of data. We recommend one CPU core available for every 2,000 flows per second (fps) of network flow data sent, or every 1,000 SNMP devices being monitored, or every 2,000 syslog messages per second collected by a container. The default is 1. -sample_rate Flag Changes the default sample rate value at which flows are passed to New Relic One Events. This does not speed up the local configuration of flow sample rate on a device, but it can slow it down. Setting this to 1 will enable capturing all flows sent to the container. The default is 1000. -nf.workers Flag Overrides the number of workers used in processing network packets. Use one worker for every 4,000 of flows per second (fps) of network flow data sent. The default is 1. -nf.port Flag Overrides the listening port for incoming flow packets. The default is 9995. -nf.source Flag ✓ (For flow containers) Sets up the type of flow this container will process. Options are ipfix, netflow5, netflow9, and sflow. -application_map Flag Sets the path to an application map file on the Docker container, based on a volume mount from the Docker host passed as an option during runtime. -dns Flag Sets the IP:Port for ktranslate to use during DNS resolution of IP addresses. Setting this affects the results for the dst_host and src_host fields. nr1.flow Argument ✓ (For flow containers) This argument statically sets the following flags: compression: gzip, sink: new_relic, format: new_relic, max_before_sample: 100, flow_only:true. nr1.snmp Argument ✓ (For SNMP containers) This argument statically sets the following options: compression: gzip, sink: new_relic, format: new_relic_metric, max_flows_per_message: 100. nr1.syslog Argument ✓ (For syslog containers) This argument statically sets the following flags: compression: gzip, sink: new_relic, format: new_relic_metric, syslog:\"0.0.0.0:5143\". NEW_RELIC_API_KEY Environment Variable ✓ Environment variable that must be used during Docker runtime to hold the New Relic license key for ktranslate to send data to the New Relic APIs. Ex: -e NEW_RELIC_API_KEY=$LICENSE_KEY. HTTPS_PROXY Environment Variable Environment variable that can be used during Docker runtime to setup ktranslate to ship data to New Relic via proxy. Ex: -e HTTPS_PROXY=https://user:password@hostname:port.",

Pairs at this level will matched against all devices in the configuration file. Uses the RE2 syntax and has a default OR operator. Prefix key with ! to force to AND operators. response_time Indicates whether response time polling is enabled for all devices in the configuration file. By default, it's set to false. Optional SNMPv3 configuration Key name Required Description user_name ✓ User name for SNMPv3 authentication authentication_protocol ✓ SNMPv3 authentication protocol. The possible values are NoAuth, MD5, or SHA authentication_passphrase SNMPv3 authentication passphrase privacy_protocol ✓ SNMPv3 privacy protocol. The possible values are AuthNoPriv, DES, AES, AES192, AES256, AES192C, or AES256C privacy_passphrase SNMPv3 privacy passphrase context_engine_id SNMPv3 context engine ID context_name SNMPv3 context name Tip You can use AWS Secrets Manager natively in your SNMP v3 config using the aws.sm.$SECRET_NAME syntax, replacing $SECRET_NAME as necessary to have ktranslate pull in your credentials during Docker runtime. Optional external config files To support a wide variety of configuration and automation needs, you can use external files that you volume mount into your Docker container to decouple certain elements of the standard configuration file. The syntax for these files is \"@fileName.extension\", including the double quotes. Discovery CIDRs Example: discovery: cidrs: \"@cidrs.yaml\" Copy The CIDRs file should use a YAML list syntax like this: - 10.10.0.0/24 - 10.20.0.0/24 - 192.168.0.21/32 Copy Devices Example: devices: - \"@neteng-devices.yaml\" - \"@dc-ops.yaml\" Copy The device files should use the same syntax as the standard devices section of the main config file, omitting the optional fields that are generated during discovery: devices: # Sample of SNMP v2c device ups_snmpv2c__10.10.0.201: device_name: ups_snmpv2c device_ip: 10.10.0.201 snmp_comm: public oid: .1.3.6.1.4.1.318.1.3.27 mib_profile: apc_ups.yml provider: kentik-ups poll_time_sec: 300 retries: 1 timeout_ms: 5000 user_tags: owning_team: dc_ops Copy The match_attributes attribute To support filtering of data that does not create value for your observability needs, you can set the global.match_attributes.{} and/or devices.<deviceName>.match_attributes.{} attribute map. This will provide filtering at the ktranslate level, before shipping data to New Relic, giving you granular control over monitoring of things like interfaces. The default behavior of this map is an OR condition, but you can override this and force an AND operator by prefixing your key name with !. This is also useful to return only matched items and omit all null and \"\" (empty) results. Default 'OR' with null and empty values Match when if_Alias begins with Uplink OR when if_interface_name begins with Gig, keep all null and \"\" values: devices: deviceName: ... match_attributes: if_Alias: \"^Uplink.*\" if_interface_name: \"^Gig.*\" Copy 'AND', omit null and empty values Match when if_Alias begins with Uplink AND when if_interface_name begins with Gig, drop all null and \"\" values: devices: deviceName: ... match_attributes: if_Alias: \"^Uplink.*\" \"!if_interface_name\": \"^Gig.*\" Copy Single match, omit null and empty values Match when if_Alias begins with Uplink, drop all null and \"\" values: devices: deviceName: ... match_attributes: \"!if_Alias\": \"^Uplink.*\" Copy The flow_only attribute To support monitoring of devices where performance statistics are nor accessible, available, or desired, you can set the devices.<deviceName>.flow_only attribute to true. This will generate a Flow Device entity in New Relic One which will only have telemetry in the KFlow event namespace. Alternatively, collecting flow telemetry from a device that is in your configuration file as an SNMP device will add decoration of the KFlow data to the pre-existing entity, such as a Router or Firewall. In New Relic One, you can see the results of this polling by investigating the following events: FROM KFlow SELECT count(*) FACET device_name WHERE instrumentation.name = 'netflow-events' TIMESERIES Copy The response_time and ping_only attributes To support monitoring of devices where performance statistics are not accessible or available, or in simple cases where basic round-trip time (RTT) monitoring is required, you can either set the global.response_time or devices.<deviceName>.ping_only attributes to true. This feature uses the go-ping package to send unprivileged UDP packets to devices in order to collect the average, min, and max RTT for the endpoint based on sending 1 packet/sec from ktranslate to the device IP address. Setting the global.response_time attribute to true will add RTT monitoring on top of existing SNMP polling. devices.<deviceName>.ping_only: true will allow you to monitor devices with only the UDP packets for RTT and no SNMP polling. In New Relic One, you can see the results of this polling by investigating the following metrics: FROM Metric SELECT average(kentik.ping.AvgRttMs) AS 'Average', max(kentik.ping.MaxRttMs) AS 'Max', min(kentik.ping.MinRttMs) AS 'Min' FACET device_name TIMESERIES Copy Tip You can use the ping_only attribute in replacement of the flow_only attribute if you would like to collect RTT metrics from a flow device. If both ping_only and flow_only are true, the device will be treated as a flow_only device. Flow data application mapping By default, flow telemetry is mapped to known applications based on evaluation of the layer 4 port in use on a specific flow conversation. If needed, you can override the default mapping by providing a YAML file during Docker runtime to the -application_map flag. This will allow you to specify application names based on ports you identify. Example syntax: applications: - ports: [9092, 9093] name: kafka - ports: [80, 8080] name: http - ports: [443, 8443] name: https Copy Flow data input filtering By default, flow data containers will collect and process every flow packet they receive. If needed, you can add an inclusion filter to the -nf.source flag that will ignore all traffic not matching the filter you provide. Syntax: --filters $TYPE,$FIELD,$FUNCTION,$MATCH Argument Name Required Description $TYPE ✓ The type of filter to apply. Possible values are string, int, and addr. $FIELD ✓ The name of the field to evaluate the match pattern against. $FUNCTION ✓ The type of function to use during evaluation. Possible values are Equal: ==, NotEqual: !=, LessThan: <, GreaterThan: >, Contains: % $MATCH ✓ The value to be used as a match pattern. Example Filters Only collect flow data from source addresses in the 10.0.0.0/24 CIDR range -nf.source sflow --filters addr,src_addr,%,10.10.0.0/24 Copy Only collect flow data where the destination port is not equal to 8531 -nf.source netflow5 --filters int,l4_dst_port,!=,8531 Copy You can also add multiple filters together with an inherited AND operator Only collect flow data from source addresses in the 10.0.0.0/24 CIDR range AND where the destination port is not equal to 8531 --filters addr,src_addr,%,10.0.0.0/24 --filters int,l4_dst_port,!=,8531 Copy",

      "body": "Profiles define what SNMP OIDs we want to collect and send to your New Relic account. This document explains how to modify an existing profile or create a new profile. Get started If you've decided to build a custom profile or modify one of our open source profiles, you need a few essential tools: A GitHub account: This enables you to raise issues and contribute changes to Kentik's open source profiles. An SNMP walk from a network device where you want to work on a profile. For more information, see our documentation on setting up SNMP and using snmpwalk. Permissions to perform Docker pull on the server that hosts your ktranslate container. This document covers: Making requests for new or modified profiles through GitHub to be worked on by the maintainers Contributing your own profiles and modifications publicly Using custom profiles privately Tip Support for all things relating to kentik/snmp-profiles is handled through GitHub issues. New Relic technical support is not able to provide any additional help beyond redirecting you back to raise an issue there. Make requests through GitHub This is the most common and simple scenario, for cases where you don't have the time or expertise with SNMP to do these yourself. After you provide the relevant data, our team will build the profile for you. Log into GitHub and go to the snmp-profiles repo. Click the Issues tab near the top. Click New issue. To request a new profile, look for the SNMP Profile Request section, and click Get started. Provide all requested information in the template, such as the device vendor, model, snmp object identifier, and a sanitized SNMP walk. For all other requests, use Open a blank issue. Tip Providing an SNMP walk is critical as we cannot do any work on the profile without these. This is not the same as an MIB file. The maintainers of the repo will review the information you provided and, if there is anything missing, they will follow up with you. Once all the necessary data is provided, they will add it to the queue of profiles to be built. After it is added to the repo, the issue will be closed, and all you have to do is update the ktranslate docker container on your end, and the newest profiles will automatically be loaded. Contribute profiles and modifications publicly We gladly accept contributions from anyone who wants to help out to either create new profiles or improve the existing profiles. To familiarize yourself with the structure of a profile, review this highly commented template.yml on GitHub. Log into GitHub and go to the snmp-profiles repo. To create a copy of the same information in your account, click the fork button near the top. Within your fork,make necessary changes to the files, or create new vendor directories and profiles as needed. Be sure to pass your profile through a YAML validator, such as codebeautify, before submitting a pull request. When you are done with your changes, submit a pull request to the upstream repo. The maintainers will review the change, and discuss any necessary feedback. When everyone is aligned, it will be merged. Shortly after a merge, new SNMP profiles are automatically available by pulling the new version of the Docker image and launching a new container in your environment. For more information, see our documentation about SNMP manual setup. Tip Be sure to sync your fork regularly to keep it up to date with changes in the upstream repo. What kinds of OIDs should I actually include in a profile? In many cases SNMP offers a lot of data, but much of that data does not provide actionable information. Or, the data provides value that is so uncommon and low impact, it might not be worth bringing into your New Relic account. You want to focus on collecting data that lets you know if there is anything that would stop the device from being able to perform whatever functions you expect it to perform. Building on from that, you should collect measurements that tell you how well it is performing those functions. Example 1: For a device operating as a VPN concentrator, we would collect high-level system metrics like: CPU and memory utilization Hardware sensor information to make sure that the device isn't going to shut itself down due to things like fan failures OIDs that tell us about the aggregated connections and throughput Example 2: An example of data that is available but provides very poor value is an OID table that lists all the running processes on a network appliance. Coming from a server admin perspective, that might sound useful, but since this is an appliance, you normally do not have the capability or the need to do anything with the processes that run inside it. Polling and storing tables with hundreds of items that you can't actually do anything with would not be efficient. Use custom profiles privately For cases where you want to make a change to a profile, but you know that it is a scenario that is very unique and would not apply to other customers you can locally edit the profiles. The way this is done is by using Docker's volume mount to pass in your customized files to the ktranslate container inside the etc/ktranslate/profiles/ directory. There are other ways you could accomplish this but in this example we will demonstrate using a git fork and clone. Ensure you are in the directory you want to keep the files in, then clone your fork of the GitHub repo to your Docker host: git clone https://github.com/<YourGitUser>/snmp-profiles.git Copy Get the command you would normally use to launch the SNMP container, and add a second volume mount argument after the one where we passed in the snmp-base.yaml. -v `pwd`/snmp-profiles/profiles:/etc/ktranslate/profiles \\ Copy The mount command replaces the built-in profiles directory with your customized data. The end result will be be similar to this: docker run -ti --name ktranslate-discovery --rm --net=host \\ --user `id -u`:`id -g` \\ -v `pwd`/snmp-base.yaml:/snmp-base.yaml \\ -v `pwd`/snmp-profiles/profiles:/etc/ktranslate/profiles \\ kentik/ktranslate:v2 \\ -snmp /snmp-base.yaml \\ -log_level info \\ -snmp_discovery=true Copy Tip Be sure to pass your custom version of the profiles in every time you launch a discovery container or SNMP polling container. If you don't use it consistently for all SNMP instances sets, this can cause unreliable behavior.",

      "body": "While running the ktranslate Docker container for New Relic network performance monitoring, you can monitor the health of the container to proactively detect potential issues. The ktranslate container image has the -tee_logs=true and -metrics=jchf settings available during runtime, which allow it to send health metrics into New Relic One directly. These are enabled by default when installing network performance monitoring via the New Relic One guided install. We recommend you to set them up when installing network performance monitoring manually. Logs from ktranslate Tip If you want to check the logs locally from the Docker host, run docker logs $CONTAINER_NAME. For example, docker logs ktranslate-snmp. The -tee_logs=true option sends logs to New Relic One when polling devices. To see them, do the following: Go to one.newrelic.com > Logs. In Find logs where, enter collector.name:\"ktranslate\" and click Query logs. Optional log parsing rule We recommend you to add a parsing rule to New Relic One logs to break the logs from ktranslate into fields that are easily searchable. This is especially helpful when you are running more than one container as it allows you to then search by the value of --service_name from the Docker container. Using the New Relic One logs UI, use the following patterns: Rule Name: ktranslate-health logs Query Attribute: \"plugin.type\" Query Value: \"ktranslate-health\" Parsing logic: %{NOTSPACE:time} ktranslate/%{NOTSPACE:container_service} \\[%{NOTSPACE:severity}\\] %{GREEDYDATA:message} Copy Alternatively, you can use New Relic's Nerdgraph API to manage your parsing rules. A sample of the logConfigurationsCreateParsingRule is below, you will need to replace $ACCOUNT_ID with the ID of your target account. mutation { logConfigurationsCreateParsingRule( accountId: $ACCOUNT_ID, rule: { description: \"ktranslate-health logs\", enabled: true, grok: \"%{NOTSPACE:time} ktranslate/%{NOTSPACE:container_service} \\\\[%{NOTSPACE:severity}\\\\] %{GREEDYDATA:message}\", lucene: \"\\\"plugin.type\\\":\\\"ktranslate-health\\\"\", nrql: \"SELECT * FROM Log WHERE `plugin.type` = 'ktranslate-health'\" } ) { errors { message type } rule { accountId id enabled description grok lucene nrql } } } Copy The result of this parsing rule is splitting a raw message from this: { \"collector.name\": \"ktranslate\", \"instrumentation.provider\": \"kentik\", \"message\": \"2021-12-08T14:59:56.007 ktranslate/snmp [Info] nrmFormat New Metadata for cisco-7513\", \"newrelic.source\": \"api.logs\", \"plugin.type\": \"ktranslate-health\", \"timestamp\": 1638975596000 } Copy To this, creating the searchable fields of container_service, severity, and time; as well as trimming the message field to more actionable data: { \"collector.name\": \"ktranslate\", \"container_service\": \"snmp\", \"instrumentation.provider\": \"kentik\", \"message\": \"nrmFormat New Metadata for cisco-7513\", \"newrelic.source\": \"api.logs\", \"plugin.type\": \"ktranslate-health\", \"severity\": \"Info\", \"time\": \"2021-12-08T15:29:56.026\", \"timestamp\": 1638977396000 } Copy Common log searches Below are some common searches that can be used during troubleshooting to gather data for support: What version of ktranslate am I running? Logs UI: bash Copy $ collector.name:\"ktranslate\" message:\"*KTranslate Running -- Version*\" NRQL: FROM Log SELECT * WHERE `collector.name` = 'ktranslate' AND `message` LIKE '%KTranslate Running -- Version%' Copy Expected Results: bash Copy $ KTranslate Running -- Version kt-2021-12-06-1546870234; Build Mon Dec 6 22:22:56 UTC 2021 What arguments were passed to Docker at runtime?

You should expect a value of 2 to be shown for a device that you have added a single match attribute to. Tip You can further filter these results by adding the device name to your query: collector.name:\"ktranslate\" message:\"*$DEVICE_NAME*Match Attribute*\". Metrics from ktranslate The -metrics option captures the following performance metrics when polling devices: Metric Granularity Description baseserver_healthcheck_execution_total Top Level Rate of internal health checks. Shows mostly that things are not deadlocked and should always be greater than 0. inputq Top Level Messages per second (msg/sec) received over the last 60 seconds from all SNMP, Flow, and VPC inputs combined. jchfq Top Level Gauge rate with number of available pre-allocated buffers. It should be about 8,000. delivery_metrics_nr Delivery to New Relic One Batches per second (batches/sec) sent over the last 60 seconds for all metrics to New Relic One. delivery_logs_nr Delivery to New Relic One Logs per second (logs/sec) sent over the last 60 seconds for all logs to New Relic One. delivery_wins_nr Delivery to New Relic One Wins per second (wins/sec) of 200 HTTP codes received over the last 60 seconds from sending metrics and events to New Relic One. device_metrics SNMP Polls per second (polls/sec) of SNMP polling over the last 60 seconds for device level metrics. interface_metrics SNMP Polls per second (polls/sec) of SNMP polling over the last 60 seconds for interface level metrics. snmp_fail SNMP Gauge to monitor if SNMP polling is working faceted by device_name. Where 1 means good and 2 means fail. netflow.flows Netflow Flows per second (fps) received over the last 60 seconds for all device flow data: IPFIX, NetFlow, or sFlow. syslog_queue Syslog Gauge of syslog messages waiting to be processed. syslog_errors Syslog Errors per second (errors/sec) over the last 60 seconds while processing syslog messages. syslog_messages Syslog Messages per second (msg/sec) received over the last 60 seconds for all syslog data. Common metrics searches To see these metrics in New Relic One: Go to one.newrelic.com and click Query your data. Enter one of the following NRQL queries: What are the current versions of my ktranslate applications?

Optional external config files To support a wide variety of configuration and automation needs, you can use external files that you volume mount into your Docker container to decouple certain elements of the standard configuration file. The syntax for these files is \"@fileName.extension\", including the double quotes. Discovery CIDRs Example: discovery: cidrs: \"@cidrs.yaml\" Copy The CIDRs file should use a YAML list syntax like this: - 10.10.0.0/24 - 10.20.0.0/24 - 192.168.0.21/32 Copy Devices Example: devices: - \"@neteng-devices.yaml\" - \"@dc-ops.yaml\" Copy The device files should use the same syntax as the standard devices section of the main config file, omitting the optional fields that are generated during discovery: devices: # Sample of SNMP v2c device ups_snmpv2c__10.10.0.201: device_name: ups_snmpv2c device_ip: 10.10.0.201 snmp_comm: public oid: .1.3.6.1.4.1.318.1.3.27 mib_profile: apc_ups.yml provider: kentik-ups poll_time_sec: 300 retries: 1 timeout_ms: 5000 user_tags: owning_team: dc_ops Copy The match_attributes attribute To support filtering of data that does not create value for your observability needs, you can set the global.match_attributes.{} and/or devices.<deviceName>.match_attributes.{} attribute map. This will provide filtering at the ktranslate level, before shipping data to New Relic, giving you granular control over monitoring of things like interfaces. The default behavior of this map is an OR condition, but you can override this and force an AND operator by prefixing your key name with !. This is also useful to return only matched items and omit all null and \"\" (empty) results. Default 'OR' with null and empty values Match when if_Alias begins with Uplink OR when if_interface_name begins with Gig, keep all null and \"\" values: devices: deviceName: ... match_attributes: if_Alias: \"^Uplink.*\" if_interface_name: \"^Gig.*\" Copy 'AND', omit null and empty values Match when if_Alias begins with Uplink AND when if_interface_name begins with Gig, drop all null and \"\" values: devices: deviceName: ... match_attributes: if_Alias: \"^Uplink.*\" \"!if_interface_name\": \"^Gig.*\" Copy Single match, omit null and empty values Match when if_Alias begins with Uplink, drop all null and \"\" values: devices: deviceName: ... match_attributes: \"!if_Alias\": \"^Uplink.*\" Copy The flow_only attribute To support monitoring of devices where performance statistics are nor accessible, available, or desired, you can set the devices.<deviceName>.flow_only attribute to true. This will generate a Flow Device entity in New Relic One which will only have telemetry in the KFlow event namespace. Alternatively, collecting flow telemetry from a device that is in your configuration file as an SNMP device will add decoration of the KFlow data to the pre-existing entity, such as a Router or Firewall. In New Relic One, you can see the results of this polling by investigating the following events: FROM KFlow SELECT count(*) FACET device_name WHERE instrumentation.name = 'netflow-events' TIMESERIES Copy The response_time and ping_only attributes To support monitoring of devices where performance statistics are not accessible or available, or in simple cases where basic round-trip time (RTT) monitoring is required, you can either set the global.response_time or devices.<deviceName>.ping_only attributes to true. This feature uses the go-ping package to send unprivileged UDP packets to devices in order to collect the average, min, and max RTT for the endpoint based on sending 1 packet/sec from ktranslate to the device IP address. Setting the global.response_time attribute to true will add RTT monitoring on top of existing SNMP polling. devices.<deviceName>.ping_only: true will allow you to monitor devices with only the UDP packets for RTT and no SNMP polling. In New Relic One, you can see the results of this polling by investigating the following metrics: FROM Metric SELECT average(kentik.ping.AvgRttMs) AS 'Average', max(kentik.ping.MaxRttMs) AS 'Max', min(kentik.ping.MinRttMs) AS 'Min' FACET device_name TIMESERIES Copy Tip You can use the ping_only attribute in replacement of the flow_only attribute if you would like to collect RTT metrics from a flow device. If both ping_only and flow_only are true, the device will be treated as a flow_only device. Flow data application mapping By default, flow telemetry is mapped to known applications based on evaluation of the layer 4 port in use on a specific flow conversation. If needed, you can override the default mapping by providing a YAML file during Docker runtime to the -application_map flag. This will allow you to specify application names based on ports you identify. Example syntax: applications: - ports: [9092, 9093] name: kafka - ports: [80, 8080] name: http - ports: [443, 8443] name: https Copy Flow data input filtering By default, flow data containers will collect and process every flow packet they receive. If needed, you can add an inclusion filter to the -nf.source flag that will ignore all traffic not matching the filter you provide. Syntax: --filters $TYPE,$FIELD,$FUNCTION,$MATCH Argument Name Required Description $TYPE ✓ The type of filter to apply. Possible values are string, int, and addr. $FIELD ✓ The name of the field to evaluate the match pattern against. $FUNCTION ✓ The type of function to use during evaluation. Possible values are Equal: ==, NotEqual: !=, LessThan: <, GreaterThan: >, Contains: % $MATCH ✓ The value to be used as a match pattern. Example Filters Only collect flow data from source addresses in the 10.0.0.0/24 CIDR range -nf.source sflow --filters addr,src_addr,%,10.10.0.0/24 Copy Only collect flow data where the destination port is not equal to 8531 -nf.source netflow5 --filters int,l4_dst_port,!=,8531 Copy You can also add multiple filters together with an inherited AND operator Only collect flow data from source addresses in the 10.0.0.0/24 CIDR range AND where the destination port is not equal to 8531 --filters addr,src_addr,%,10.0.0.0/24 --filters int,l4_dst_port,!=,8531 Copy",

      "body": "This page outlines the options for management of the ktranslate container used by New Relic NPM. Container requirements We recommend the following resources for the ktranslate container image: Disk 100MB available disk space CPU SNMP Polling/Trap Collection: 1 CPU core dedicated for every ~1,000 devices Device Flow Collection: 1 CPU core dedicated for every ~2,000 flows per second (fps) Syslog Message Collection: 1 CPU core dedicated for every ~2,000 messages per second Memory ktranslate is not generally constrained by memory resources. The amount of memory on your host should be driven by the types of applications/containers you plan to run. For a general idea, we commonly see success with image sizes as small as the AWS t2.micro which has 1 vCPU and 1.0 GB of available RAM. Tip The ktranslate container image runs a single \"job type\" at a time. For instance, a container deployed for SNMP polling and trap collection will not be used for flow collection. Furthermore, containers deployed for flow collection are limited to a single -nf.source type per container. This means that it is common to have multiple containers deployed to a single Docker host at any given time. They can also share a common configuration file, but do not have to. Updating the container Keeping the ktranslate container image up to date is good practice to both receive the latest updates and resolve common problems through various bug fixes applied during the development lifecycle. It is recommended to always pull the latest available image when redeploying your containers. Pull the latest container image available bash Copy $ docker pull kentik/ktranslate:v2 Collect the IDs and names of any existing containers bash Copy $ docker ps -a --filter ancestor=kentik/ktranslate:v2 --format \"{{.ID}} - {{.Names}}\" Output Example: 3297b134a352 - ktranslate-snmp 4962a854b386 - ktranslate-sflow Copy Remove any pre-existing containers bash Copy $ docker rm -f $CONTAINER_ID Redeploy your ktranslate container using the original settings you deployed with from either SNMP, flow data, or syslog collection. Important The configuration file used by ktranslate is applied to the container at runtime. Changes to this file require you to remove and restart your running container(s) to apply the edits. Container runtime options Below are the various options available during Docker runtime for the ktranslate container image: Option name Type Required Description -snmp Flag ✓ Sets the path to the snmp-base.yaml file on the Docker container, based on the volume mount from the Docker host passed as an option during runtime. -nr_account_id Flag ✓ The New Relic One account ID that ktranslate will ship data to. -log_level Flag Overrides the default info log level for ktranslate. The available options are debug, info, warn, or error. -snmp_discovery Flag Used to setup the container in SNMP discovery mode. -tee_logs Flag Forwards Docker logs from ktranslate into New Relic One Logs. -metrics=jchf Flag Forwards health metrics from ktranslate into New Relic One. -service_name Flag Appended to the container name in Docker logs to help isolate logs from various containers in New Relic One Logs. -nr_region Flag Sets the regional API endpoints for ktranslate to forward telemetry to New Relic One. Options are US, EU, and GOV (FedRAMP). -max_threads Flag Lets you process higher volumes of data. We recommend one CPU core available for every 2,000 flows per second (fps) of network flow data sent, or every 1,000 SNMP devices being monitored, or every 2,000 syslog messages per second collected by a container. The default is 1. -sample_rate Flag Changes the default sample rate value at which flows are passed to New Relic One Events. This does not speed up the local configuration of flow sample rate on a device, but it can slow it down. Setting this to 1 will enable capturing all flows sent to the container. The default is 1000. -nf.workers Flag Overrides the number of workers used in processing network packets. Use one worker for every 4,000 of flows per second (fps) of network flow data sent. The default is 1. -nf.port Flag Overrides the listening port for incoming flow packets. The default is 9995. -nf.source Flag ✓ (For flow containers) Sets up the type of flow this container will process. Options are ipfix, netflow5, netflow9, and sflow. -application_map Flag Sets the path to an application map file on the Docker container, based on a volume mount from the Docker host passed as an option during runtime. -dns Flag Sets the IP:Port for ktranslate to use during DNS resolution of IP addresses. Setting this affects the results for the dst_host and src_host fields. nr1.flow Argument ✓ (For flow containers) This argument statically sets the following flags: compression: gzip, sink: new_relic, format: new_relic, max_before_sample: 100, flow_only:true. nr1.snmp Argument ✓ (For SNMP containers) This argument statically sets the following options: compression: gzip, sink: new_relic, format: new_relic_metric, max_flows_per_message: 100. nr1.syslog Argument ✓ (For syslog containers) This argument statically sets the following flags: compression: gzip, sink: new_relic, format: new_relic_metric, syslog:\"0.0.0.0:5143\". NEW_RELIC_API_KEY Environment Variable ✓ Environment variable that must be used during Docker runtime to hold the New Relic license key for ktranslate to send data to the New Relic APIs. Ex: -e NEW_RELIC_API_KEY=$LICENSE_KEY. HTTPS_PROXY Environment Variable Environment variable that can be used during Docker runtime to setup ktranslate to ship data to New Relic via proxy. Ex: -e HTTPS_PROXY=https://user:password@hostname:port.",

The flow_only attribute on both a ktranslate docker container level and in the devices section of the snmp-base.yaml file allows you to get different results: If you have multiple containers collecting both SNMP and network flow data with the ktranslate docker image, define your devices in the snmp-base.yaml file, following the standards for SNMP data polling. They will be automatically matched to their respective flows based on their device_ip matching the sampling IP for the flow device. For network flow data devices, run the ktranslate docker image with the -flow_only=true option. snmp-base.yaml file - No setting changes needed If you have multiple containers collecting both SNMP and network flow data with the ktranslate docker image, and you have specific devices where you only want network flow or SNMP data collection and no SNMP or network flow data polling respectively, you can set them up in their respective device configuration section in the snmp-base.yaml file. For network flow data devices, run the ktranslate docker image with the -flow_only=true option. snmp-base.yaml file - Change the flow_only to true: flow_only: true Copy Advanced options for running the ktranslate docker image In this table you can find additional options you can use with the ktranslate docker image. Option name Description -max_threads Lets you process higher volumes of flow. We recommend one CPU core available for every 2,000 flows per second (fps) of network flow data sent. -sample_rate=100 Changes the default sample rate value at which flows are passed to New Relic One Events. It also sets the sample rate value for flow types that don't have a default sample rate value. -nf.workers=1 Overrides the number of workers used in processing udp packets. Use one worker for every 4,000 of flows per second (fps) of network flow data sent. -nf.port Overrides the default 9995 listening port for incoming flow packets. -listen Overrides the default 8082 port used by ktranslate to expose health metrics. You must use this option when running multiple ktranslate containers on a single host. -metalisten Overrides the default 8083 port used by ktranslate to expose metadata. You must use this option when running multiple ktranslate containers on a single host. -metrics=jchf Forwards health metrics from ktranslate into New Relic One. -log_level Overrides the default info log level for ktranslate. The available options are debug, info, warn, or error. -tee_logs Forwards logs from ktranslate into New Relic One Logs. HTTPS_PROXY Environment variable that can be used during Docker runtime to setup ktranslate to ship data to New Relic via proxy. Ex: -e HTTPS_PROXY=https://user:password@hostname:port You can also run several ktranslate images to monitor different network flow types simultaneously. See the follwing example: bash Copy $ docker run -d --name ktranslate-sflow --net=host \\ > -e NEW_RELIC_API_KEY=$INSERT_API_KEY \\ > kentik/ktranslate:v2 \\ > -snmp /snmp-base.yaml \\ > -nr_account_id=$NR_ACCOUNT_ID \\ > -metrics=jchf \\ > -log_level=info \\ > -tee_logs=true \\ > -nf.source=sflow \\ > -nf.port=9996 \\ > -max_threads=1 \\ > -listen 0.0.0.0:8084 \\ > -metalisten 0.0.0.0:8085 \\ > nr1.flow $ $ $ docker run -d --name ktranslate-netflow9 --net=host \\ > -e NEW_RELIC_API_KEY=$INSERT_API_KEY \\ > kentik/ktranslate:v2 \\ > -snmp /snmp-base.yaml \\ > -nr_account_id=$NR_ACCOUNT_ID \\ > -metrics=jchf \\ > -log_level=info \\ > -tee_logs=true \\ > -nf.source=netflow9 \\ > -nf.port=2055 \\ > -max_threads=2 \\ > -listen 0.0.0.0:8086 \\ > -metalisten 0.0.0.0:8087 \\ > nr1.flow Logs sent with Network performance monitoring If you want to check the logs locally, run docker logs ktranslate-snmp. The -tee_logs=true option sends logs to New Relic One when polling devices. To see them, do the following: Go to one.newrelic.com > Logs. In Find logs where enter collector.name:\"ktranslate\" and click Query logs. Tip If you want to filter out all the information messages, enter collector.name:\"ktranslate\" message:-*\\[Info\\]*. Metrics sent with Network performance monitoring The -metrics option captures one of the following performance metrics when polling devices: Metric Description baseserver_healthcheck_execution_total Rate of internal health checks. Shows mostly that things are not deadlocked. delivery_metrics_nr Rate of metrics sent to New Relic One. delivery_logs_nr Rate of logs sent to New Relic One. delivery_wins_nr Rate of 200 HTTP codes received from sending metrics and events to New Relic One. device_metrics Rate of SNMP polling of device level metrics. inputq Messages per second (msg/sec) recieved over the last 60 seconds from SNMP or network flow devices. interface_metrics Rate of SNMP polling of interface level metrics. jchfq Gauge rate with number of available pre-allocated buffers. It should be 8,000 aproximately. To see these metrics in New Relic One: Go to one.newrelic.com and click Query your data. Enter the following NRQL query: FROM Metric SELECT latest(kentik.ktranslate.chf.kkc.baseserver_healthcheck_execution_total) AS 'baseserver_healthcheck_execution_total', latest(kentik.ktranslate.chf.kkc.delivery_metrics_nr) AS 'delivery_metrics_nr', latest(kentik.ktranslate.chf.kkc.delivery_logs_nr) AS 'delivery_logs_nr', latest(kentik.ktranslate.chf.kkc.delivery_wins_nr) AS 'delivery_wins_nr', latest(kentik.ktranslate.chf.kkc.device_metrics) AS 'device_metrics', latest(kentik.ktranslate.chf.kkc.inputq) AS 'inputq', latest(kentik.ktranslate.chf.kkc.interface_metrics) AS 'interface_metrics', latest(kentik.ktranslate.chf.kkc.jchfq) AS 'jchfq' WHERE provider = 'kentik-agent' AND instrumentation.name = 'heartbeat' LIMIT MAX Copy",

      "body": "While running the ktranslate Docker container for New Relic network performance monitoring, you can monitor the health of the container to proactively detect potential issues. The ktranslate container image has the -tee_logs=true and -metrics=jchf settings available during runtime, which allow it to send health metrics into New Relic One directly. These are enabled by default when installing network performance monitoring via the New Relic One guided install. We recommend you to set them up when installing network performance monitoring manually. Logs from ktranslate Tip If you want to check the logs locally from the Docker host, run docker logs $CONTAINER_NAME. For example, docker logs ktranslate-snmp. The -tee_logs=true option sends logs to New Relic One when polling devices. To see them, do the following: Go to one.newrelic.com > Logs. In Find logs where, enter collector.name:\"ktranslate\" and click Query logs. Optional log parsing rule We recommend you to add a parsing rule to New Relic One logs to break the logs from ktranslate into fields that are easily searchable. This is especially helpful when you are running more than one container as it allows you to then search by the value of --service_name from the Docker container. Using the New Relic One logs UI, use the following patterns: Rule Name: ktranslate-health logs Query Attribute: \"plugin.type\" Query Value: \"ktranslate-health\" Parsing logic: %{NOTSPACE:time} ktranslate/%{NOTSPACE:container_service} \\[%{NOTSPACE:severity}\\] %{GREEDYDATA:message} Copy Alternatively, you can use New Relic's Nerdgraph API to manage your parsing rules. A sample of the logConfigurationsCreateParsingRule is below, you will need to replace $ACCOUNT_ID with the ID of your target account. mutation { logConfigurationsCreateParsingRule( accountId: $ACCOUNT_ID, rule: { description: \"ktranslate-health logs\", enabled: true, grok: \"%{NOTSPACE:time} ktranslate/%{NOTSPACE:container_service} \\\\[%{NOTSPACE:severity}\\\\] %{GREEDYDATA:message}\", lucene: \"\\\"plugin.type\\\":\\\"ktranslate-health\\\"\", nrql: \"SELECT * FROM Log WHERE `plugin.type` = 'ktranslate-health'\" } ) { errors { message type } rule { accountId id enabled description grok lucene nrql } } } Copy The result of this parsing rule is splitting a raw message from this: { \"collector.name\": \"ktranslate\", \"instrumentation.provider\": \"kentik\", \"message\": \"2021-12-08T14:59:56.007 ktranslate/snmp [Info] nrmFormat New Metadata for cisco-7513\", \"newrelic.source\": \"api.logs\", \"plugin.type\": \"ktranslate-health\", \"timestamp\": 1638975596000 } Copy To this, creating the searchable fields of container_service, severity, and time; as well as trimming the message field to more actionable data: { \"collector.name\": \"ktranslate\", \"container_service\": \"snmp\", \"instrumentation.provider\": \"kentik\", \"message\": \"nrmFormat New Metadata for cisco-7513\", \"newrelic.source\": \"api.logs\", \"plugin.type\": \"ktranslate-health\", \"severity\": \"Info\", \"time\": \"2021-12-08T15:29:56.026\", \"timestamp\": 1638977396000 } Copy Common log searches Below are some common searches that can be used during troubleshooting to gather data for support: What version of ktranslate am I running? Logs UI: bash Copy $ collector.name:\"ktranslate\" message:\"*KTranslate Running -- Version*\" NRQL: FROM Log SELECT * WHERE `collector.name` = 'ktranslate' AND `message` LIKE '%KTranslate Running -- Version%' Copy Expected Results: bash Copy $ KTranslate Running -- Version kt-2021-12-06-1546870234; Build Mon Dec 6 22:22:56 UTC 2021 What arguments were passed to Docker at runtime? Logs UI: bash Copy $ collector.name:\"ktranslate\" message:\"*KTranslate CLI:*\" NRQL: FROM Log SELECT * WHERE `collector.name` = 'ktranslate' AND `message` LIKE '%KTranslate CLI:%' Copy Expected Results: bash Copy $ KTranslate CLI: [ktranslate -listen off -mapping /etc/ktranslate/config.json -geo /etc/ktranslate/GeoLite2-Country.mmdb -udrs /etc/ktranslate/udr.csv -api_devices /etc/ktranslate/devices.json -asn /etc/ktranslate/GeoLite2-ASN.mmdb -log_level info -snmp /snmp-base.yaml -nr_account_id=2583772 -log_level=info -metrics=jchf -tee_logs=true -service_name=snmp nr1.snmp] What errors am I experiencing? Without a parsing rule applied to your logs Logs UI: bash Copy $ collector.name:\"ktranslate\" message:-*\\[Info\\]* NRQL: FROM Log SELECT * WHERE `collector.name` = 'ktranslate' AND `message` NOT LIKE '%[Info]%' Copy With a parsing rule applied to your logs Logs UI: bash Copy $ collector.name:\"ktranslate\" severity:-\"Info\" NRQL: FROM Log SELECT * WHERE `collector.name` = 'ktranslate' AND `severity` != 'Info' Copy Expected Results: bash Copy $ KTranslate>cisco-7513 There was an SNMP polling error with the CustomDeviceMetrics walking OID .1.3.6.1.2.1.4.31.1.1.21 after 0 retries: request timeout (after 0 retries). Is my match_attributes filter working on my device? Logs UI: bash Copy $ collector.name:\"ktranslate\" message:\"*Match Attribute*\" NRQL: FROM Log SELECT * WHERE `collector.name` = 'ktranslate' AND `message` LIKE '%Match Attribute%' Copy Expected Results: bash Copy $ KTranslate>cisco-7513 Added 1 Match Attribute(s) All devices are expected to have at least 1 Match Attribute inherited from the default monitor_admin_shut: true configuration. You should expect a value of 2 to be shown for a device that you have added a single match attribute to. Tip You can further filter these results by adding the device name to your query: collector.name:\"ktranslate\" message:\"*$DEVICE_NAME*Match Attribute*\". Metrics from ktranslate The -metrics option captures the following performance metrics when polling devices: Metric Granularity Description baseserver_healthcheck_execution_total Top Level Rate of internal health checks. Shows mostly that things are not deadlocked and should always be greater than 0. inputq Top Level Messages per second (msg/sec) received over the last 60 seconds from all SNMP, Flow, and VPC inputs combined. jchfq Top Level Gauge rate with number of available pre-allocated buffers. It should be about 8,000. delivery_metrics_nr Delivery to New Relic One Batches per second (batches/sec) sent over the last 60 seconds for all metrics to New Relic One. delivery_logs_nr Delivery to New Relic One Logs per second (logs/sec) sent over the last 60 seconds for all logs to New Relic One. delivery_wins_nr Delivery to New Relic One Wins per second (wins/sec) of 200 HTTP codes received over the last 60 seconds from sending metrics and events to New Relic One. device_metrics SNMP Polls per second (polls/sec) of SNMP polling over the last 60 seconds for device level metrics. interface_metrics SNMP Polls per second (polls/sec) of SNMP polling over the last 60 seconds for interface level metrics. snmp_fail SNMP Gauge to monitor if SNMP polling is working faceted by device_name. Where 1 means good and 2 means fail. netflow.flows Netflow Flows per second (fps) received over the last 60 seconds for all device flow data: IPFIX, NetFlow, or sFlow. syslog_queue Syslog Gauge of syslog messages waiting to be processed. syslog_errors Syslog Errors per second (errors/sec) over the last 60 seconds while processing syslog messages. syslog_messages Syslog Messages per second (msg/sec) received over the last 60 seconds for all syslog data. Common metrics searches To see these metrics in New Relic One: Go to one.newrelic.com and click Query your data.

Get started If you've decided to build a custom profile or modify one of our open source profiles, you need a few essential tools: A GitHub account: This enables you to raise issues and contribute changes to Kentik's open source profiles. An SNMP walk from a network device where you want to work on a profile. For more information, see our documentation on setting up SNMP and using snmpwalk. Permissions to perform Docker pull on the server that hosts your ktranslate container. This document covers: Making requests for new or modified profiles through GitHub to be worked on by the maintainers Contributing your own profiles and modifications publicly Using custom profiles privately Tip Support for all things relating to kentik/snmp-profiles is handled through GitHub issues. New Relic technical support is not able to provide any additional help beyond redirecting you back to raise an issue there. Make requests through GitHub This is the most common and simple scenario, for cases where you don't have the time or expertise with SNMP to do these yourself. After you provide the relevant data, our team will build the profile for you. Log into GitHub and go to the snmp-profiles repo. Click the Issues tab near the top. Click New issue. To request a new profile, look for the SNMP Profile Request section, and click Get started. Provide all requested information in the template, such as the device vendor, model, snmp object identifier, and a sanitized SNMP walk. For all other requests, use Open a blank issue. Tip Providing an SNMP walk is critical as we cannot do any work on the profile without these. This is not the same as an MIB file. The maintainers of the repo will review the information you provided and, if there is anything missing, they will follow up with you. Once all the necessary data is provided, they will add it to the queue of profiles to be built. After it is added to the repo, the issue will be closed, and all you have to do is update the ktranslate docker container on your end, and the newest profiles will automatically be loaded. Contribute profiles and modifications publicly We gladly accept contributions from anyone who wants to help out to either create new profiles or improve the existing profiles. To familiarize yourself with the structure of a profile, review this highly commented template.yml on GitHub. Log into GitHub and go to the snmp-profiles repo. To create a copy of the same information in your account, click the fork button near the top. Within your fork,make necessary changes to the files, or create new vendor directories and profiles as needed. Be sure to pass your profile through a YAML validator, such as codebeautify, before submitting a pull request. When you are done with your changes, submit a pull request to the upstream repo. The maintainers will review the change, and discuss any necessary feedback. When everyone is aligned, it will be merged. Shortly after a merge, new SNMP profiles are automatically available by pulling the new version of the Docker image and launching a new container in your environment. For more information, see our documentation about SNMP manual setup. Tip Be sure to sync your fork regularly to keep it up to date with changes in the upstream repo. What kinds of OIDs should I actually include in a profile? In many cases SNMP offers a lot of data, but much of that data does not provide actionable information. Or, the data provides value that is so uncommon and low impact, it might not be worth bringing into your New Relic account. You want to focus on collecting data that lets you know if there is anything that would stop the device from being able to perform whatever functions you expect it to perform. Building on from that, you should collect measurements that tell you how well it is performing those functions. Example 1: For a device operating as a VPN concentrator, we would collect high-level system metrics like: CPU and memory utilization Hardware sensor information to make sure that the device isn't going to shut itself down due to things like fan failures OIDs that tell us about the aggregated connections and throughput Example 2: An example of data that is available but provides very poor value is an OID table that lists all the running processes on a network appliance. Coming from a server admin perspective, that might sound useful, but since this is an appliance, you normally do not have the capability or the need to do anything with the processes that run inside it. Polling and storing tables with hundreds of items that you can't actually do anything with would not be efficient. Use custom profiles privately For cases where you want to make a change to a profile, but you know that it is a scenario that is very unique and would not apply to other customers you can locally edit the profiles. The way this is done is by using Docker's volume mount to pass in your customized files to the ktranslate container inside the etc/ktranslate/profiles/ directory. There are other ways you could accomplish this but in this example we will demonstrate using a git fork and clone. Ensure you are in the directory you want to keep the files in, then clone your fork of the GitHub repo to your Docker host: git clone https://github.com/<YourGitUser>/snmp-profiles.git Copy Get the command you would normally use to launch the SNMP container, and add a second volume mount argument after the one where we passed in the snmp-base.yaml. -v `pwd`/snmp-profiles/profiles:/etc/ktranslate/profiles \\ Copy The mount command replaces the built-in profiles directory with your customized data. The end result will be be similar to this: docker run -ti --name ktranslate-discovery --rm --net=host \\ --user `id -u`:`id -g` \\ -v `pwd`/snmp-base.yaml:/snmp-base.yaml \\ -v `pwd`/snmp-profiles/profiles:/etc/ktranslate/profiles \\ kentik/ktranslate:v2 \\ -snmp /snmp-base.yaml \\ -log_level info \\ -snmp_discovery=true Copy Tip Be sure to pass your custom version of the profiles in every time you launch a discovery container or SNMP polling container. If you don't use it consistently for all SNMP instances sets, this can cause unreliable behavior.",

Optional external config files To support a wide variety of configuration and automation needs, you can use external files that you volume mount into your Docker container to decouple certain elements of the standard configuration file. The syntax for these files is \"@fileName.extension\", including the double quotes. Discovery CIDRs Example: discovery: cidrs: \"@cidrs.yaml\" Copy The CIDRs file should use a YAML list syntax like this: - 10.10.0.0/24 - 10.20.0.0/24 - 192.168.0.21/32 Copy Devices Example: devices: - \"@neteng-devices.yaml\" - \"@dc-ops.yaml\" Copy The device files should use the same syntax as the standard devices section of the main config file, omitting the optional fields that are generated during discovery: devices: # Sample of SNMP v2c device ups_snmpv2c__10.10.0.201: device_name: ups_snmpv2c device_ip: 10.10.0.201 snmp_comm: public oid: .1.3.6.1.4.1.318.1.3.27 mib_profile: apc_ups.yml provider: kentik-ups poll_time_sec: 300 retries: 1 timeout_ms: 5000 user_tags: owning_team: dc_ops Copy The match_attributes attribute To support filtering of data that does not create value for your observability needs, you can set the global.match_attributes.{} and/or devices.<deviceName>.match_attributes.{} attribute map. This will provide filtering at the ktranslate level, before shipping data to New Relic, giving you granular control over monitoring of things like interfaces. The default behavior of this map is an OR condition, but you can override this and force an AND operator by prefixing your key name with !. This is also useful to return only matched items and omit all null and \"\" (empty) results. Default 'OR' with null and empty values Match when if_Alias begins with Uplink OR when if_interface_name begins with Gig, keep all null and \"\" values: devices: deviceName: ... match_attributes: if_Alias: \"^Uplink.*\" if_interface_name: \"^Gig.*\" Copy 'AND', omit null and empty values Match when if_Alias begins with Uplink AND when if_interface_name begins with Gig, drop all null and \"\" values: devices: deviceName: ... match_attributes: if_Alias: \"^Uplink.*\" \"!if_interface_name\": \"^Gig.*\" Copy Single match, omit null and empty values Match when if_Alias begins with Uplink, drop all null and \"\" values: devices: deviceName: ... match_attributes: \"!if_Alias\": \"^Uplink.*\" Copy The flow_only attribute To support monitoring of devices where performance statistics are nor accessible, available, or desired, you can set the devices.<deviceName>.flow_only attribute to true. This will generate a Flow Device entity in New Relic One which will only have telemetry in the KFlow event namespace. Alternatively, collecting flow telemetry from a device that is in your configuration file as an SNMP device will add decoration of the KFlow data to the pre-existing entity, such as a Router or Firewall. In New Relic One, you can see the results of this polling by investigating the following events: FROM KFlow SELECT count(*) FACET device_name WHERE instrumentation.name = 'netflow-events' TIMESERIES Copy The response_time and ping_only attributes To support monitoring of devices where performance statistics are not accessible or available, or in simple cases where basic round-trip time (RTT) monitoring is required, you can either set the global.response_time or devices.<deviceName>.ping_only attributes to true. This feature uses the go-ping package to send unprivileged UDP packets to devices in order to collect the average, min, and max RTT for the endpoint based on sending 1 packet/sec from ktranslate to the device IP address. Setting the global.response_time attribute to true will add RTT monitoring on top of existing SNMP polling. devices.<deviceName>.ping_only: true will allow you to monitor devices with only the UDP packets for RTT and no SNMP polling. In New Relic One, you can see the results of this polling by investigating the following metrics: FROM Metric SELECT average(kentik.ping.AvgRttMs) AS 'Average', max(kentik.ping.MaxRttMs) AS 'Max', min(kentik.ping.MinRttMs) AS 'Min' FACET device_name TIMESERIES Copy Tip You can use the ping_only attribute in replacement of the flow_only attribute if you would like to collect RTT metrics from a flow device. If both ping_only and flow_only are true, the device will be treated as a flow_only device. Flow data application mapping By default, flow telemetry is mapped to known applications based on evaluation of the layer 4 port in use on a specific flow conversation. If needed, you can override the default mapping by providing a YAML file during Docker runtime to the -application_map flag. This will allow you to specify application names based on ports you identify. Example syntax: applications: - ports: [9092, 9093] name: kafka - ports: [80, 8080] name: http - ports: [443, 8443] name: https Copy Flow data input filtering By default, flow data containers will collect and process every flow packet they receive. If needed, you can add an inclusion filter to the -nf.source flag that will ignore all traffic not matching the filter you provide. Syntax: --filters $TYPE,$FIELD,$FUNCTION,$MATCH Argument Name Required Description $TYPE ✓ The type of filter to apply. Possible values are string, int, and addr. $FIELD ✓ The name of the field to evaluate the match pattern against. $FUNCTION ✓ The type of function to use during evaluation. Possible values are Equal: ==, NotEqual: !=, LessThan: <, GreaterThan: >, Contains: % $MATCH ✓ The value to be used as a match pattern. Example Filters Only collect flow data from source addresses in the 10.0.0.0/24 CIDR range -nf.source sflow --filters addr,src_addr,%,10.10.0.0/24 Copy Only collect flow data where the destination port is not equal to 8531 -nf.source netflow5 --filters int,l4_dst_port,!=,8531 Copy You can also add multiple filters together with an inherited AND operator Only collect flow data from source addresses in the 10.0.0.0/24 CIDR range AND where the destination port is not equal to 8531 --filters addr,src_addr,%,10.0.0.0/24 --filters int,l4_dst_port,!=,8531 Copy",

      "body": "While running the ktranslate Docker container for New Relic network performance monitoring, you can monitor the health of the container to proactively detect potential issues. The ktranslate container image has the -tee_logs=true and -metrics=jchf settings available during runtime, which allow it to send health metrics into New Relic One directly. These are enabled by default when installing network performance monitoring via the New Relic One guided install. We recommend you to set them up when installing network performance monitoring manually. Logs from ktranslate Tip If you want to check the logs locally from the Docker host, run docker logs $CONTAINER_NAME. For example, docker logs ktranslate-snmp. The -tee_logs=true option sends logs to New Relic One when polling devices. To see them, do the following: Go to one.newrelic.com > Logs. In Find logs where, enter collector.name:\"ktranslate\" and click Query logs. Optional log parsing rule We recommend you to add a parsing rule to New Relic One logs to break the logs from ktranslate into fields that are easily searchable. This is especially helpful when you are running more than one container as it allows you to then search by the value of --service_name from the Docker container. Using the New Relic One logs UI, use the following patterns: Rule Name: ktranslate-health logs Query Attribute: \"plugin.type\" Query Value: \"ktranslate-health\" Parsing logic: %{NOTSPACE:time} ktranslate/%{NOTSPACE:container_service} \\[%{NOTSPACE:severity}\\] %{GREEDYDATA:message} Copy Alternatively, you can use New Relic's Nerdgraph API to manage your parsing rules. A sample of the logConfigurationsCreateParsingRule is below, you will need to replace $ACCOUNT_ID with the ID of your target account. mutation { logConfigurationsCreateParsingRule( accountId: $ACCOUNT_ID, rule: { description: \"ktranslate-health logs\", enabled: true, grok: \"%{NOTSPACE:time} ktranslate/%{NOTSPACE:container_service} \\\\[%{NOTSPACE:severity}\\\\] %{GREEDYDATA:message}\", lucene: \"\\\"plugin.type\\\":\\\"ktranslate-health\\\"\", nrql: \"SELECT * FROM Log WHERE `plugin.type` = 'ktranslate-health'\" } ) { errors { message type } rule { accountId id enabled description grok lucene nrql } } } Copy The result of this parsing rule is splitting a raw message from this: { \"collector.name\": \"ktranslate\", \"instrumentation.provider\": \"kentik\", \"message\": \"2021-12-08T14:59:56.007 ktranslate/snmp [Info] nrmFormat New Metadata for cisco-7513\", \"newrelic.source\": \"api.logs\", \"plugin.type\": \"ktranslate-health\", \"timestamp\": 1638975596000 } Copy To this, creating the searchable fields of container_service, severity, and time; as well as trimming the message field to more actionable data: { \"collector.name\": \"ktranslate\", \"container_service\": \"snmp\", \"instrumentation.provider\": \"kentik\", \"message\": \"nrmFormat New Metadata for cisco-7513\", \"newrelic.source\": \"api.logs\", \"plugin.type\": \"ktranslate-health\", \"severity\": \"Info\", \"time\": \"2021-12-08T15:29:56.026\", \"timestamp\": 1638977396000 } Copy Common log searches Below are some common searches that can be used during troubleshooting to gather data for support: What version of ktranslate am I running? Logs UI: bash Copy $ collector.name:\"ktranslate\" message:\"*KTranslate Running -- Version*\" NRQL: FROM Log SELECT * WHERE `collector.name` = 'ktranslate' AND `message` LIKE '%KTranslate Running -- Version%' Copy Expected Results: bash Copy $ KTranslate Running -- Version kt-2021-12-06-1546870234; Build Mon Dec 6 22:22:56 UTC 2021 What arguments were passed to Docker at runtime? Logs UI: bash Copy $ collector.name:\"ktranslate\" message:\"*KTranslate CLI:*\" NRQL: FROM Log SELECT * WHERE `collector.name` = 'ktranslate' AND `message` LIKE '%KTranslate CLI:%' Copy Expected Results: bash Copy $ KTranslate CLI: [ktranslate -listen off -mapping /etc/ktranslate/config.json -geo /etc/ktranslate/GeoLite2-Country.mmdb -udrs /etc/ktranslate/udr.csv -api_devices /etc/ktranslate/devices.json -asn /etc/ktranslate/GeoLite2-ASN.mmdb -log_level info -snmp /snmp-base.yaml -nr_account_id=2583772 -log_level=info -metrics=jchf -tee_logs=true -service_name=snmp nr1.snmp] What errors am I experiencing? Without a parsing rule applied to your logs Logs UI: bash Copy $ collector.name:\"ktranslate\" message:-*\\[Info\\]* NRQL: FROM Log SELECT * WHERE `collector.name` = 'ktranslate' AND `message` NOT LIKE '%[Info]%' Copy With a parsing rule applied to your logs Logs UI: bash Copy $ collector.name:\"ktranslate\" severity:-\"Info\" NRQL: FROM Log SELECT * WHERE `collector.name` = 'ktranslate' AND `severity` != 'Info' Copy Expected Results: bash Copy $ KTranslate>cisco-7513 There was an SNMP polling error with the CustomDeviceMetrics walking OID .1.3.6.1.2.1.4.31.1.1.21 after 0 retries: request timeout (after 0 retries). Is my match_attributes filter working on my device? Logs UI: bash Copy $ collector.name:\"ktranslate\" message:\"*Match Attribute*\" NRQL: FROM Log SELECT * WHERE `collector.name` = 'ktranslate' AND `message` LIKE '%Match Attribute%' Copy Expected Results: bash Copy $ KTranslate>cisco-7513 Added 1 Match Attribute(s) All devices are expected to have at least 1 Match Attribute inherited from the default monitor_admin_shut: true configuration. You should expect a value of 2 to be shown for a device that you have added a single match attribute to. Tip You can further filter these results by adding the device name to your query: collector.name:\"ktranslate\" message:\"*$DEVICE_NAME*Match Attribute*\". Metrics from ktranslate The -metrics option captures the following performance metrics when polling devices: Metric Granularity Description baseserver_healthcheck_execution_total Top Level Rate of internal health checks. Shows mostly that things are not deadlocked and should always be greater than 0. inputq Top Level Messages per second (msg/sec) received over the last 60 seconds from all SNMP, Flow, and VPC inputs combined. jchfq Top Level Gauge rate with number of available pre-allocated buffers. It should be about 8,000. delivery_metrics_nr Delivery to New Relic One Batches per second (batches/sec) sent over the last 60 seconds for all metrics to New Relic One. delivery_logs_nr Delivery to New Relic One Logs per second (logs/sec) sent over the last 60 seconds for all logs to New Relic One. delivery_wins_nr Delivery to New Relic One Wins per second (wins/sec) of 200 HTTP codes received over the last 60 seconds from sending metrics and events to New Relic One. device_metrics SNMP Polls per second (polls/sec) of SNMP polling over the last 60 seconds for device level metrics. interface_metrics SNMP Polls per second (polls/sec) of SNMP polling over the last 60 seconds for interface level metrics. snmp_fail SNMP Gauge to monitor if SNMP polling is working faceted by device_name. Where 1 means good and 2 means fail. netflow.flows Netflow Flows per second (fps) received over the last 60 seconds for all device flow data: IPFIX, NetFlow, or sFlow. syslog_queue Syslog Gauge of syslog messages waiting to be processed. syslog_errors Syslog Errors per second (errors/sec) over the last 60 seconds while processing syslog messages. syslog_messages Syslog Messages per second (msg/sec) received over the last 60 seconds for all syslog data. Common metrics searches To see these metrics in New Relic One: Go to one.newrelic.com and click Query your data. Enter one of the following NRQL queries: What are the current versions of my ktranslate applications? FROM Metric SELECT latest(ver) AS 'image_version' FACET host AS 'docker_host', svc AS 'container_service' WHERE provider = 'kentik-agent' AND instrumentation.name = 'heartbeat' Copy What is the health of my ktranslate application?

Optional external config files To support a wide variety of configuration and automation needs, you can use external files that you volume mount into your Docker container to decouple certain elements of the standard configuration file. The syntax for these files is \"@fileName.extension\", including the double quotes. Discovery CIDRs Example: discovery: cidrs: \"@cidrs.yaml\" Copy The CIDRs file should use a YAML list syntax like this: - 10.10.0.0/24 - 10.20.0.0/24 - 192.168.0.21/32 Copy Devices Example: devices: - \"@neteng-devices.yaml\" - \"@dc-ops.yaml\" Copy The device files should use the same syntax as the standard devices section of the main config file, omitting the optional fields that are generated during discovery: devices: # Sample of SNMP v2c device ups_snmpv2c__10.10.0.201: device_name: ups_snmpv2c device_ip: 10.10.0.201 snmp_comm: public oid: .1.3.6.1.4.1.318.1.3.27 mib_profile: apc_ups.yml provider: kentik-ups poll_time_sec: 300 retries: 1 timeout_ms: 5000 user_tags: owning_team: dc_ops Copy The match_attributes attribute To support filtering of data that does not create value for your observability needs, you can set the global.match_attributes.{} and/or devices.<deviceName>.match_attributes.{} attribute map. This will provide filtering at the ktranslate level, before shipping data to New Relic, giving you granular control over monitoring of things like interfaces. The default behavior of this map is an OR condition, but you can override this and force an AND operator by prefixing your key name with !. This is also useful to return only matched items and omit all null and \"\" (empty) results. Default 'OR' with null and empty values Match when if_Alias begins with Uplink OR when if_interface_name begins with Gig, keep all null and \"\" values: devices: deviceName: ... match_attributes: if_Alias: \"^Uplink.*\" if_interface_name: \"^Gig.*\" Copy 'AND', omit null and empty values Match when if_Alias begins with Uplink AND when if_interface_name begins with Gig, drop all null and \"\" values: devices: deviceName: ... match_attributes: if_Alias: \"^Uplink.*\" \"!if_interface_name\": \"^Gig.*\" Copy Single match, omit null and empty values Match when if_Alias begins with Uplink, drop all null and \"\" values: devices: deviceName: ... match_attributes: \"!if_Alias\": \"^Uplink.*\" Copy The flow_only attribute To support monitoring of devices where performance statistics are nor accessible, available, or desired, you can set the devices.<deviceName>.flow_only attribute to true. This will generate a Flow Device entity in New Relic One which will only have telemetry in the KFlow event namespace. Alternatively, collecting flow telemetry from a device that is in your configuration file as an SNMP device will add decoration of the KFlow data to the pre-existing entity, such as a Router or Firewall. In New Relic One, you can see the results of this polling by investigating the following events: FROM KFlow SELECT count(*) FACET device_name WHERE instrumentation.name = 'netflow-events' TIMESERIES Copy The response_time and ping_only attributes To support monitoring of devices where performance statistics are not accessible or available, or in simple cases where basic round-trip time (RTT) monitoring is required, you can either set the global.response_time or devices.<deviceName>.ping_only attributes to true. This feature uses the go-ping package to send unprivileged UDP packets to devices in order to collect the average, min, and max RTT for the endpoint based on sending 1 packet/sec from ktranslate to the device IP address. Setting the global.response_time attribute to true will add RTT monitoring on top of existing SNMP polling. devices.<deviceName>.ping_only: true will allow you to monitor devices with only the UDP packets for RTT and no SNMP polling. In New Relic One, you can see the results of this polling by investigating the following metrics: FROM Metric SELECT average(kentik.ping.AvgRttMs) AS 'Average', max(kentik.ping.MaxRttMs) AS 'Max', min(kentik.ping.MinRttMs) AS 'Min' FACET device_name TIMESERIES Copy Tip You can use the ping_only attribute in replacement of the flow_only attribute if you would like to collect RTT metrics from a flow device. If both ping_only and flow_only are true, the device will be treated as a flow_only device. Flow data application mapping By default, flow telemetry is mapped to known applications based on evaluation of the layer 4 port in use on a specific flow conversation. If needed, you can override the default mapping by providing a YAML file during Docker runtime to the -application_map flag. This will allow you to specify application names based on ports you identify. Example syntax: applications: - ports: [9092, 9093] name: kafka - ports: [80, 8080] name: http - ports: [443, 8443] name: https Copy Flow data input filtering By default, flow data containers will collect and process every flow packet they receive. If needed, you can add an inclusion filter to the -nf.source flag that will ignore all traffic not matching the filter you provide. Syntax: --filters $TYPE,$FIELD,$FUNCTION,$MATCH Argument Name Required Description $TYPE ✓ The type of filter to apply. Possible values are string, int, and addr. $FIELD ✓ The name of the field to evaluate the match pattern against. $FUNCTION ✓ The type of function to use during evaluation. Possible values are Equal: ==, NotEqual: !=, LessThan: <, GreaterThan: >, Contains: % $MATCH ✓ The value to be used as a match pattern. Example Filters Only collect flow data from source addresses in the 10.0.0.0/24 CIDR range -nf.source sflow --filters addr,src_addr,%,10.10.0.0/24 Copy Only collect flow data where the destination port is not equal to 8531 -nf.source netflow5 --filters int,l4_dst_port,!=,8531 Copy You can also add multiple filters together with an inherited AND operator Only collect flow data from source addresses in the 10.0.0.0/24 CIDR range AND where the destination port is not equal to 8531 --filters addr,src_addr,%,10.0.0.0/24 --filters int,l4_dst_port,!=,8531 Copy",

When running the ktranslate container, you will specify which major type you want to monitor using the -nf.source option. Important The ktranslate container only supports monitoring one type of network flow data type at a time. If you want to monitor several types, each will require a container. IPFIX and NetFlow v9 can be sent to the same container, but we recommend running a separate container as a best practice. Network flow data type -nf.source value IPFIX ipfix NetFlow v5 netflow5 NetFlow v9 netflow9 sFlow sflow AppFlow netflow5 Argus netflow5 cflowd netflow5 J-Flow netflow5 NetStream netflow5 RFlow netflow5 Cisco NSEL netflow9 Scaling network flow collection When planning your strategy for collecting network flows at scale, New Relic recommends 1 CPU per 2000 flows-per-second (120,000 flows-per-minute). Deciding whether to run more small containers to distribute load or fewer large containers to consolidate management is a matter of personal preference.

You can manually add other mibs to the global.mibs_enabled attribute if you did not set discovery.add_mibs: true before running the discovery. Run ktranslate to poll target devices by running: bash Copy $ docker run -d --name ktranslate-snmp --restart unless-stopped --net=host \\ > -v `pwd`/snmp-base.yaml:/snmp-base.yaml \\ > -e NEW_RELIC_API_KEY=$YOUR_NR_LICENSE_KEY \\ > kentik/ktranslate:v2 \\ > -snmp /snmp-base.yaml \\ > -nr_account_id=$YOUR_NR_ACCOUNT_ID \\ > ## If your account is located in Europe, add the following flag: $ ## -nr_region=EU \\ $ ## If you want to use FedRAMP, add the following flag to use the FedRAMP authorized endpoints: $ ## -nr_region=GOV \\ $ -metrics=jchf \\ > -tee_logs=true \\ > -service_name=snmp \\ > nr1.snmp To get better visibility into how your network is being used, set up network flow data monitoring.

Prerequisites New Relic One account prerequisites A New Relic account. Don't have one? Sign up for free! No credit card required. A New Relic account ID. Read how to find your account ID. A New Relic license key. Read how to generate a new License key. AWS prerequisites AWS VPC Flow Export configured to existing S3 bucket. Permissions to build and publish images to Amazon ECR. Permissions to create a Lambda function. AWS CLI (v 1.9.15+) installed. Docker installed. Required fields from VPC flow logs Important The default format for flow logs does not include all of the required fields that are required for ktranslate to work properly. You must ensure that the below fields are added or the data you'll receive in New Relic One will be incomplete. Flow Record Field Description version The VPC Flow Logs version. srcaddr The source address for incoming traffic, or the IPv4 or IPv6 address of the network interface for outgoing traffic. For a network interface, the IPv4 address is always its private IPv4 address. dstaddr The destination address for outgoing traffic, or the IPv4 or IPv6 address of the network interface for incoming traffic. For a network interface, the IPv4 address is always its private IPv4 address. srcport The source port of the traffic. dstport The destination port of the traffic. protocol The IANA protocol number of the traffic. packets The number of packets transferred during the flow. bytes The number of bytes transferred during the flow. vpc-id The ID of the VPC that contains the network interface for which the traffic is recorded. flow-direction The direction of the flow with respect to the interface where traffic is captured. The possible values are ingress and egress. Set up AWS VPC flow logs monitoring in New Relic One To send your VPC flow logs to New Relic One, follow these steps: Create a private ECR registry and upload the ktranslate image Create a Lambda function from the ECR image Validate your settings 1. Create a private ECR registry and upload the ktranslate image Authenticate to your registry by running: bash Copy $ aws ecr get-login-password --region $AWS_ACCOUNT_REGION | docker login --username AWS --password-stdin $AWS_ACCOUNT_ID.dkr.ecr.$AWS_ACCOUNT_REGION.amazonaws.com Create a repository to hold the ktranslate image by running: bash Copy $ aws ecr create-repository --repository-name ktranslate --image-scanning-configuration scanOnPush=true --region $AWS_ACCOUNT_REGION Pull the ktranslate image from Docker Hub by running: bash Copy $ docker pull kentik/ktranslate:v2 Tag the image to push to your docker repository by running: bash Copy $ docker tag kentik/ktranslate:v2 $AWS_ACCOUNT_ID.dkr.ecr.$AWS_ACCOUNT_REGION.amazonaws.com/ktranslate:v2 Push the image to your docker repository by running: bash Copy $ docker push $AWS_ACCOUNT_ID.dkr.ecr.$AWS_ACCOUNT_REGION.amazonaws.com/ktranslate:v2 After running these steps, you should see an output similar to the following: bash Copy $ The push refers to repository [$AWS_ACCOUNT_ID.dkr.ecr.$AWS_ACCOUNT_REGION.amazonaws.com/ktranslate] $ 870d899ac0b0: Pushed $ 0a4768abd477: Pushed $ b206b92a2843: Pushed $ 22abafd3e6c9: Pushed $ 1335c3725252: Pushed $ 7188c9350e77: Pushed $ 2b75f71baacd: Pushed $ ba50c5652654: Pushed $ 80bbd31930ea: Pushed $ c3d2a28a326e: Pushed $ 1a058d5342cc: Pushed $ v2: digest: sha256:4cfe36919ae954063203a80f69ca1795280117c44947a09d678b4842bb8e4dd2 size: 2624 2. Create a Lambda function from the ECR image The Lambda function you create must reside in the same AWS Region as the S3 bucket where you store your VPC flow logs. To create a Lambda function defined as a container image, follow the following steps: Navigate to the Lambda service in your AWS console and select Create function. Select the Container image tile at the top of the screen, and: Name your function. Click Browse Images and choose the ktranslate image with the v2 tag you pushed to ECR. Keep the architecture on x86_64, accept the default permissions, and click Create function. On the landing page for your new function, select the Configuration tab, and: In General configuration, change the timeout value to 0 min 20 sec. In the Permissions section, click Execution role for your function, which will open a new tab for IAM. On the Permissions tab, select Attach policies and add the AmazonS3ReadOnlyAccess to grant your function access to the S3 bucket your VPC flow logs are in. Back on your function's landing page, in the Environment variables section, click Edit and add the Lambda environment variables. On the Triggers section, click Add trigger, and: Select the S3 type. Select the bucket where you store your VPC Flow Logs. Choose the All object create events event type. Optionally, if your bucket has a custom folder in the root directory outside the AWSLogs directory, you can add it in the Prefix section. Accept the Recursive Invocation warning and click Add. At this point, your Lambda function is deployed and listening for new events on your S3 bucket. 3. Validate your settings Tip It can take several minutes for data to first appear in your account as the export of VPC flow logs to S3 usually runs on a 5-minute cycle. To confirm your Lambda function is working as expected, do one of the following: Go to one.newrelic.com > Explorer and you will begin to see VPC Network entities. You can click them and investigate the various metrics each one is sending. Go to one.newrelic.com > Query your data and to get a quick summary of the recent VPCs that you have flow logs from, run the following NRQL query: FROM KFlow SELECT count(*) FACET device_name WHERE provider = 'kentik-vpc' Copy In your AWS Console, click the Monitor tab in your function's landing page, where you can track important metrics like invocation, error count, and success rate. You can also investigate the error logs from recent invocations. Tip We recommend you to add serverless monitoring from New Relic One to your new Lambda function. This way, you'll proactively monitor the health of the function and get alerts in case of problems. Find and use your metrics All VPC flow logs exported from the ktranslate Lambda function use the KFlow namespace, via the New Relic Event API. Currently, these are the fields populated from this integration: Attribute Type Description application String The class of program generating the traffic in this flow record. This is derived from the lowest numeric value from l4_dst_port and l4_src_port. Common examples include http, ssh, and ftp. dest_vpc String The name of the VPC the traffic in this flow record is targeting, if known. device_name String The name of the VPC this flow record was exported from. dst_addr String The target IPv4 address for this flow record. dst_as Numeric The target Autonomous System Number for this flow record. dst_as_name String The target Autonomous System Name for this flow record. dst_endpoint String The target IP:Port tuple for this flow record. This is a combination of dst_addr and l4_dst_port. dst_geo String The target country for this flow record, if known. flow_direction String The direction of flow for this record, from the point of view of the interface where the traffic was captured. Valid options are ingress | egress. in_bytes Numeric The number of bytes transferred for ingress flow records. in_pkts Numeric The number of packets transferred for ingress flow records. l4_dst_port Numeric The target port for this flow record. l4_src_port Numeric The source port for this flow record. out_bytes Numeric The number of bytes transferred for egress flow records. out_pkts Numeric The number of packets transferred for egress flow records. protocol String The display name of the protocol used in this flow record, derived from the numeric IANA protocol number provider String This attribute is used to uniquely identify various sources of data from ktranslate. VPC flow logs will always have the value of kentik-vpc. sample_rate Numeric The rate at which ktranslate samples from the various files in the S3 bucket for flow exports. (Default: 1000) This can be configured with the KENTIK_SAMPLE_RATE environment variable. source_vpc String The name of the VPC the traffic in this flow record originated from, if known. src_addr String The source IPv4 address for this flow record. src_as Numeric The source Autonomous System Number for this flow record. src_as_name String The source Autonomous System Name for this flow record. src_endpoint String The source IP:Port tuple for this flow record. This is a combination of src_addr and l4_src_port. src_geo String The source country for this flow record, if known. start_time Numeric The time, in Unix seconds, when the first packet of the flow was received within the aggregation interval. This might be up to 60 seconds after the packet was transmitted or received on the network interface. timestamp Numeric The time, in Unix seconds, when this flow record was received by the New Relic Event API. Environment variables for AWS Lambda functions When you're configuring your AWS Lambda function, you need to set up the following environment variables: Key Value Required KENTIK_MODE nr1.vpc.lambda √ NEW_RELIC_API_KEY The New Relic license key for your account √ NR_ACCOUNT_ID Your New Relic account ID √ NR_REGION The New Relic datacenter region for your account. The possible values are US and EU, and by default it's set to US. KENTIK_SAMPLE_RATE The rate of randomized sampling ktranslate applies to the flow export objects in S3. By default, it's set to 1000. Setting this to 1 disables all sampling and ktranslate ships all flow records to New Relic One. Tip For S3 objects with less than 100 flow records, ktranslate will revert to a sample rate of 1 and process every record. For S3 objects with more than 100 flow records, ktranslate will use the configured value of KENTIK_SAMPLE_RATE, which has a default of 1000. Meaning that every record in the object has a 1:1000 change of being sampled.",

When running the ktranslate container, you will specify which major type you want to monitor using the -nf.source option. Important The ktranslate container only supports monitoring one type of network flow data type at a time. If you want to monitor several types, each will require a container. IPFIX and NetFlow v9 can be sent to the same container, but we recommend running a separate container as a best practice. Network flow data type -nf.source value IPFIX ipfix NetFlow v5 netflow5 NetFlow v9 netflow9 sFlow sflow AppFlow netflow5 Argus netflow5 cflowd netflow5 J-Flow netflow5 NetStream netflow5 RFlow netflow5 Cisco NSEL netflow9 Scaling network flow collection When planning your strategy for collecting network flows at scale, New Relic recommends 1 CPU per 2000 flows-per-second (120,000 flows-per-minute). Deciding whether to run more small containers to distribute load or fewer large containers to consolidate management is a matter of personal preference. Set up network flow data monitoring in New Relic One Go to one.newrelic.com and click Add more data. Scroll down until you see Network performance monitoring and click Network Flows. Follow the steps in New Relic One. one.newrelic.com > Add more data > Network performance monitoring > Network Flows to set up network flow data monitoring. To get better visibility into your network device performance, set up SNMP data monitoring. Visualize your network performance data in New Relic. Manual setup If you prefer to do the setup manually, proceed with the following steps. In your local machine, from a Linux host with Docker installed, download the ktranslate image from dockerhub by running bash Copy $ docker pull kentik/ktranslate:v2 Copy the snmp-base.yaml file to the local $HOME directory of your Docker user, and discard the container by running bash Copy $ cd . $ id=$(docker create kentik/ktranslate:v2) $ docker cp $id:/etc/ktranslate/snmp-base.yaml . $ docker rm -v $id In the snmp-base.yaml file, add your network flow devices inside the devices key with the following structure: devices: flowDevice: device_name: edge-router device_ip: 10.10.1.254 flow_only: true # Optional user tags user_tags: owning_team: net_eng environment: production Copy Tip If you're already monitoring SNMP data devices that send network flow data, you don't need to add them in your snmp-base.yaml file a second time. Run ktranslate to listen for network flows by running: bash Copy $ docker run -d --name ktranslate-sflow --restart unless-stopped --net=host \\ > -v `pwd`/snmp-base.yaml:/snmp-base.yaml \\ > -e NEW_RELIC_API_KEY=$YOUR_NR_LICENSE_KEY \\ > kentik/ktranslate:v2 \\ > -snmp /snmp-base.yaml \\ > -nr_account_id=$YOUR_NR_ACCOUNT_ID \\ > ## If your account is located in Europe, add the following flag: $ ## -nr_region=EU \\ $ ## If you want to use FedRAMP, add the following flag to use the FedRAMP authorized endpoints: $ ## -nr_region=GOV \\ $ -metrics=jchf \\ > -tee_logs=true \\ > -flow_only=true \\ > -nf.source=sflow \\ > -service_name=sflow \\ > nr1.flow Tip This command assumes collection of sflow data. If you are collecting other flow types, you should change the suffix in the --name flag for the container and update the -nf.source and -service_name flags as necessary. To get better visibility into your network device performance, set up SNMP data monitoring. To get insights into system messages from your devices, setup network syslog collection.

      "body": "BETA FEATURE This feature is currently in open beta and still in development, but we encourage you to try it out! Set up your AWS VPC flow logs to send them to New Relic One. Prerequisites New Relic One account prerequisites A New Relic account. Don't have one? Sign up for free! No credit card required. A New Relic account ID. Read how to find your account ID. A New Relic license key. Read how to generate a new License key. AWS prerequisites AWS VPC Flow Export configured to existing S3 bucket. Permissions to build and publish images to Amazon ECR. Permissions to create a Lambda function. AWS CLI (v 1.9.15+) installed. Docker installed. Required fields from VPC flow logs Important The default format for flow logs does not include all of the required fields that are required for ktranslate to work properly. You must ensure that the below fields are added or the data you'll receive in New Relic One will be incomplete. Flow Record Field Description version The VPC Flow Logs version. srcaddr The source address for incoming traffic, or the IPv4 or IPv6 address of the network interface for outgoing traffic. For a network interface, the IPv4 address is always its private IPv4 address. dstaddr The destination address for outgoing traffic, or the IPv4 or IPv6 address of the network interface for incoming traffic. For a network interface, the IPv4 address is always its private IPv4 address. srcport The source port of the traffic. dstport The destination port of the traffic. protocol The IANA protocol number of the traffic. packets The number of packets transferred during the flow. bytes The number of bytes transferred during the flow. vpc-id The ID of the VPC that contains the network interface for which the traffic is recorded. flow-direction The direction of the flow with respect to the interface where traffic is captured. The possible values are ingress and egress. Set up AWS VPC flow logs monitoring in New Relic One To send your VPC flow logs to New Relic One, follow these steps: Create a private ECR registry and upload the ktranslate image Create a Lambda function from the ECR image Validate your settings 1. Create a private ECR registry and upload the ktranslate image Authenticate to your registry by running: bash Copy $ aws ecr get-login-password --region $AWS_ACCOUNT_REGION | docker login --username AWS --password-stdin $AWS_ACCOUNT_ID.dkr.ecr.$AWS_ACCOUNT_REGION.amazonaws.com Create a repository to hold the ktranslate image by running: bash Copy $ aws ecr create-repository --repository-name ktranslate --image-scanning-configuration scanOnPush=true --region $AWS_ACCOUNT_REGION Pull the ktranslate image from Docker Hub by running: bash Copy $ docker pull kentik/ktranslate:v2 Tag the image to push to your docker repository by running: bash Copy $ docker tag kentik/ktranslate:v2 $AWS_ACCOUNT_ID.dkr.ecr.$AWS_ACCOUNT_REGION.amazonaws.com/ktranslate:v2 Push the image to your docker repository by running: bash Copy $ docker push $AWS_ACCOUNT_ID.dkr.ecr.$AWS_ACCOUNT_REGION.amazonaws.com/ktranslate:v2 After running these steps, you should see an output similar to the following: bash Copy $ The push refers to repository [$AWS_ACCOUNT_ID.dkr.ecr.$AWS_ACCOUNT_REGION.amazonaws.com/ktranslate] $ 870d899ac0b0: Pushed $ 0a4768abd477: Pushed $ b206b92a2843: Pushed $ 22abafd3e6c9: Pushed $ 1335c3725252: Pushed $ 7188c9350e77: Pushed $ 2b75f71baacd: Pushed $ ba50c5652654: Pushed $ 80bbd31930ea: Pushed $ c3d2a28a326e: Pushed $ 1a058d5342cc: Pushed $ v2: digest: sha256:4cfe36919ae954063203a80f69ca1795280117c44947a09d678b4842bb8e4dd2 size: 2624 2. Create a Lambda function from the ECR image The Lambda function you create must reside in the same AWS Region as the S3 bucket where you store your VPC flow logs. To create a Lambda function defined as a container image, follow the following steps: Navigate to the Lambda service in your AWS console and select Create function. Select the Container image tile at the top of the screen, and: Name your function. Click Browse Images and choose the ktranslate image with the v2 tag you pushed to ECR. Keep the architecture on x86_64, accept the default permissions, and click Create function. On the landing page for your new function, select the Configuration tab, and: In General configuration, change the timeout value to 0 min 20 sec. In the Permissions section, click Execution role for your function, which will open a new tab for IAM. On the Permissions tab, select Attach policies and add the AmazonS3ReadOnlyAccess to grant your function access to the S3 bucket your VPC flow logs are in. Back on your function's landing page, in the Environment variables section, click Edit and add the Lambda environment variables. On the Triggers section, click Add trigger, and: Select the S3 type. Select the bucket where you store your VPC Flow Logs. Choose the All object create events event type. Optionally, if your bucket has a custom folder in the root directory outside the AWSLogs directory, you can add it in the Prefix section. Accept the Recursive Invocation warning and click Add. At this point, your Lambda function is deployed and listening for new events on your S3 bucket. 3. Validate your settings Tip It can take several minutes for data to first appear in your account as the export of VPC flow logs to S3 usually runs on a 5-minute cycle. To confirm your Lambda function is working as expected, do one of the following: Go to one.newrelic.com > Explorer and you will begin to see VPC Network entities. You can click them and investigate the various metrics each one is sending. Go to one.newrelic.com > Query your data and to get a quick summary of the recent VPCs that you have flow logs from, run the following NRQL query: FROM KFlow SELECT count(*) FACET device_name WHERE provider = 'kentik-vpc' Copy In your AWS Console, click the Monitor tab in your function's landing page, where you can track important metrics like invocation, error count, and success rate. You can also investigate the error logs from recent invocations. Tip We recommend you to add serverless monitoring from New Relic One to your new Lambda function. This way, you'll proactively monitor the health of the function and get alerts in case of problems. Find and use your metrics All VPC flow logs exported from the ktranslate Lambda function use the KFlow namespace, via the New Relic Event API. Currently, these are the fields populated from this integration: Attribute Type Description application String The class of program generating the traffic in this flow record. This is derived from the lowest numeric value from l4_dst_port and l4_src_port. Common examples include http, ssh, and ftp. dest_vpc String The name of the VPC the traffic in this flow record is targeting, if known. device_name String The name of the VPC this flow record was exported from. dst_addr String The target IPv4 address for this flow record. dst_as Numeric The target Autonomous System Number for this flow record. dst_as_name String The target Autonomous System Name for this flow record. dst_endpoint String The target IP:Port tuple for this flow record. This is a combination of dst_addr and l4_dst_port. dst_geo String The target country for this flow record, if known. flow_direction String The direction of flow for this record, from the point of view of the interface where the traffic was captured. Valid options are ingress | egress. in_bytes Numeric The number of bytes transferred for ingress flow records. in_pkts Numeric The number of packets transferred for ingress flow records. l4_dst_port Numeric The target port for this flow record. l4_src_port Numeric The source port for this flow record. out_bytes Numeric The number of bytes transferred for egress flow records. out_pkts Numeric The number of packets transferred for egress flow records. protocol String The display name of the protocol used in this flow record, derived from the numeric IANA protocol number provider String This attribute is used to uniquely identify various sources of data from ktranslate. VPC flow logs will always have the value of kentik-vpc. sample_rate Numeric The rate at which ktranslate samples from the various files in the S3 bucket for flow exports. (Default: 1000) This can be configured with the KENTIK_SAMPLE_RATE environment variable. source_vpc String The name of the VPC the traffic in this flow record originated from, if known. src_addr String The source IPv4 address for this flow record. src_as Numeric The source Autonomous System Number for this flow record. src_as_name String The source Autonomous System Name for this flow record. src_endpoint String The source IP:Port tuple for this flow record. This is a combination of src_addr and l4_src_port. src_geo String The source country for this flow record, if known. start_time Numeric The time, in Unix seconds, when the first packet of the flow was received within the aggregation interval. This might be up to 60 seconds after the packet was transmitted or received on the network interface. timestamp Numeric The time, in Unix seconds, when this flow record was received by the New Relic Event API. Environment variables for AWS Lambda functions When you're configuring your AWS Lambda function, you need to set up the following environment variables: Key Value Required KENTIK_MODE nr1.vpc.lambda √ NEW_RELIC_API_KEY The New Relic license key for your account √ NR_ACCOUNT_ID Your New Relic account ID √ NR_REGION The New Relic datacenter region for your account. The possible values are US and EU, and by default it's set to US. KENTIK_SAMPLE_RATE The rate of randomized sampling ktranslate applies to the flow export objects in S3. By default, it's set to 1000. Setting this to 1 disables all sampling and ktranslate ships all flow records to New Relic One. Tip For S3 objects with less than 100 flow records, ktranslate will revert to a sample rate of 1 and process every record. For S3 objects with more than 100 flow records, ktranslate will use the configured value of KENTIK_SAMPLE_RATE, which has a default of 1000. Meaning that every record in the object has a 1:1000 change of being sampled.",

When running the ktranslate container, you will specify which major type you want to monitor using the -nf.source option. Important The ktranslate container only supports monitoring one type of network flow data type at a time. If you want to monitor several types, each will require a container.

A New Relic license key. Read how to generate a new License key. AWS prerequisites AWS VPC Flow Export configured to existing S3 bucket. Permissions to build and publish images to Amazon ECR. Permissions to create a Lambda function. AWS CLI (v 1.9.15+) installed. Docker installed. Required fields from VPC flow logs Important The default format for flow logs does not include all of the required fields that are required for ktranslate to work properly. You must ensure that the below fields are added or the data you'll receive in New Relic One will be incomplete. Flow Record Field Description version The VPC Flow Logs version. srcaddr The source address for incoming traffic, or the IPv4 or IPv6 address of the network interface for outgoing traffic. For a network interface, the IPv4 address is always its private IPv4 address. dstaddr The destination address for outgoing traffic, or the IPv4 or IPv6 address of the network interface for incoming traffic. For a network interface, the IPv4 address is always its private IPv4 address. srcport The source port of the traffic. dstport The destination port of the traffic. protocol The IANA protocol number of the traffic. packets The number of packets transferred during the flow. bytes The number of bytes transferred during the flow. vpc-id The ID of the VPC that contains the network interface for which the traffic is recorded. flow-direction The direction of the flow with respect to the interface where traffic is captured. The possible values are ingress and egress. Set up AWS VPC flow logs monitoring in New Relic One To send your VPC flow logs to New Relic One, follow these steps: Create a private ECR registry and upload the ktranslate image Create a Lambda function from the ECR image Validate your settings 1. Create a private ECR registry and upload the ktranslate image Authenticate to your registry by running: bash Copy $ aws ecr get-login-password --region $AWS_ACCOUNT_REGION | docker login --username AWS --password-stdin $AWS_ACCOUNT_ID.dkr.ecr.$AWS_ACCOUNT_REGION.amazonaws.com Create a repository to hold the ktranslate image by running: bash Copy $ aws ecr create-repository --repository-name ktranslate --image-scanning-configuration scanOnPush=true --region $AWS_ACCOUNT_REGION Pull the ktranslate image from Docker Hub by running: bash Copy $ docker pull kentik/ktranslate:v2 Tag the image to push to your docker repository by running: bash Copy $ docker tag kentik/ktranslate:v2 $AWS_ACCOUNT_ID.dkr.ecr.$AWS_ACCOUNT_REGION.amazonaws.com/ktranslate:v2 Push the image to your docker repository by running: bash Copy $ docker push $AWS_ACCOUNT_ID.dkr.ecr.$AWS_ACCOUNT_REGION.amazonaws.com/ktranslate:v2 After running these steps, you should see an output similar to the following: bash Copy $ The push refers to repository [$AWS_ACCOUNT_ID.dkr.ecr.$AWS_ACCOUNT_REGION.amazonaws.com/ktranslate] $ 870d899ac0b0: Pushed $ 0a4768abd477: Pushed $ b206b92a2843: Pushed $ 22abafd3e6c9: Pushed $ 1335c3725252: Pushed $ 7188c9350e77: Pushed $ 2b75f71baacd: Pushed $ ba50c5652654: Pushed $ 80bbd31930ea: Pushed $ c3d2a28a326e: Pushed $ 1a058d5342cc: Pushed $ v2: digest: sha256:4cfe36919ae954063203a80f69ca1795280117c44947a09d678b4842bb8e4dd2 size: 2624 2. Create a Lambda function from the ECR image The Lambda function you create must reside in the same AWS Region as the S3 bucket where you store your VPC flow logs. To create a Lambda function defined as a container image, follow the following steps: Navigate to the Lambda service in your AWS console and select Create function. Select the Container image tile at the top of the screen, and: Name your function. Click Browse Images and choose the ktranslate image with the v2 tag you pushed to ECR. Keep the architecture on x86_64, accept the default permissions, and click Create function. On the landing page for your new function, select the Configuration tab, and: In General configuration, change the timeout value to 0 min 20 sec. In the Permissions section, click Execution role for your function, which will open a new tab for IAM. On the Permissions tab, select Attach policies and add the AmazonS3ReadOnlyAccess to grant your function access to the S3 bucket your VPC flow logs are in. Back on your function's landing page, in the Environment variables section, click Edit and add the Lambda environment variables. On the Triggers section, click Add trigger, and: Select the S3 type. Select the bucket where you store your VPC Flow Logs. Choose the All object create events event type. Optionally, if your bucket has a custom folder in the root directory outside the AWSLogs directory, you can add it in the Prefix section. Accept the Recursive Invocation warning and click Add. At this point, your Lambda function is deployed and listening for new events on your S3 bucket. 3. Validate your settings Tip It can take several minutes for data to first appear in your account as the export of VPC flow logs to S3 usually runs on a 5-minute cycle. To confirm your Lambda function is working as expected, do one of the following: Go to one.newrelic.com > Explorer and you will begin to see VPC Network entities. You can click them and investigate the various metrics each one is sending. Go to one.newrelic.com > Query your data and to get a quick summary of the recent VPCs that you have flow logs from, run the following NRQL query: FROM KFlow SELECT count(*) FACET device_name WHERE provider = 'kentik-vpc' Copy In your AWS Console, click the Monitor tab in your function's landing page, where you can track important metrics like invocation, error count, and success rate. You can also investigate the error logs from recent invocations. Tip We recommend you to add serverless monitoring from New Relic One to your new Lambda function. This way, you'll proactively monitor the health of the function and get alerts in case of problems. Find and use your metrics All VPC flow logs exported from the ktranslate Lambda function use the KFlow namespace, via the New Relic Event API. Currently, these are the fields populated from this integration: Attribute Type Description application String The class of program generating the traffic in this flow record. This is derived from the lowest numeric value from l4_dst_port and l4_src_port. Common examples include http, ssh, and ftp. dest_vpc String The name of the VPC the traffic in this flow record is targeting, if known. device_name String The name of the VPC this flow record was exported from. dst_addr String The target IPv4 address for this flow record. dst_as Numeric The target Autonomous System Number for this flow record. dst_as_name String The target Autonomous System Name for this flow record. dst_endpoint String The target IP:Port tuple for this flow record. This is a combination of dst_addr and l4_dst_port. dst_geo String The target country for this flow record, if known. flow_direction String The direction of flow for this record, from the point of view of the interface where the traffic was captured. Valid options are ingress | egress. in_bytes Numeric The number of bytes transferred for ingress flow records. in_pkts Numeric The number of packets transferred for ingress flow records. l4_dst_port Numeric The target port for this flow record. l4_src_port Numeric The source port for this flow record. out_bytes Numeric The number of bytes transferred for egress flow records. out_pkts Numeric The number of packets transferred for egress flow records. protocol String The display name of the protocol used in this flow record, derived from the numeric IANA protocol number provider String This attribute is used to uniquely identify various sources of data from ktranslate. VPC flow logs will always have the value of kentik-vpc. sample_rate Numeric The rate at which ktranslate samples from the various files in the S3 bucket for flow exports. (Default: 1000) This can be configured with the KENTIK_SAMPLE_RATE environment variable. source_vpc String The name of the VPC the traffic in this flow record originated from, if known. src_addr String The source IPv4 address for this flow record. src_as Numeric The source Autonomous System Number for this flow record. src_as_name String The source Autonomous System Name for this flow record. src_endpoint String The source IP:Port tuple for this flow record. This is a combination of src_addr and l4_src_port. src_geo String The source country for this flow record, if known. start_time Numeric The time, in Unix seconds, when the first packet of the flow was received within the aggregation interval. This might be up to 60 seconds after the packet was transmitted or received on the network interface. timestamp Numeric The time, in Unix seconds, when this flow record was received by the New Relic Event API. Environment variables for AWS Lambda functions When you're configuring your AWS Lambda function, you need to set up the following environment variables: Key Value Required KENTIK_MODE nr1.vpc.lambda √ NEW_RELIC_API_KEY The New Relic license key for your account √ NR_ACCOUNT_ID Your New Relic account ID √ NR_REGION The New Relic datacenter region for your account. The possible values are US and EU, and by default it's set to US. KENTIK_SAMPLE_RATE The rate of randomized sampling ktranslate applies to the flow export objects in S3. By default, it's set to 1000. Setting this to 1 disables all sampling and ktranslate ships all flow records to New Relic One. Tip For S3 objects with less than 100 flow records, ktranslate will revert to a sample rate of 1 and process every record. For S3 objects with more than 100 flow records, ktranslate will use the configured value of KENTIK_SAMPLE_RATE, which has a default of 1000. Meaning that every record in the object has a 1:1000 change of being sampled.",

      "body": "While running the ktranslate Docker container for New Relic network performance monitoring, you can monitor the health of the container to proactively detect potential issues. The ktranslate container image has the -tee_logs=true and -metrics=jchf settings available during runtime, which allow it to send health metrics into New Relic One directly. These are enabled by default when installing network performance monitoring via the New Relic One guided install. We recommend you to set them up when installing network performance monitoring manually. Logs from ktranslate Tip If you want to check the logs locally from the Docker host, run docker logs $CONTAINER_NAME. For example, docker logs ktranslate-snmp. The -tee_logs=true option sends logs to New Relic One when polling devices. To see them, do the following: Go to one.newrelic.com > Logs. In Find logs where, enter collector.name:\"ktranslate\" and click Query logs. Optional log parsing rule We recommend you to add a parsing rule to New Relic One logs to break the logs from ktranslate into fields that are easily searchable. This is especially helpful when you are running more than one container as it allows you to then search by the value of --service_name from the Docker container. Using the New Relic One logs UI, use the following patterns: Rule Name: ktranslate-health logs Query Attribute: \"plugin.type\" Query Value: \"ktranslate-health\" Parsing logic: %{NOTSPACE:time} ktranslate/%{NOTSPACE:container_service} \\[%{NOTSPACE:severity}\\] %{GREEDYDATA:message} Copy Alternatively, you can use New Relic's Nerdgraph API to manage your parsing rules. A sample of the logConfigurationsCreateParsingRule is below, you will need to replace $ACCOUNT_ID with the ID of your target account. mutation { logConfigurationsCreateParsingRule( accountId: $ACCOUNT_ID, rule: { description: \"ktranslate-health logs\", enabled: true, grok: \"%{NOTSPACE:time} ktranslate/%{NOTSPACE:container_service} \\\\[%{NOTSPACE:severity}\\\\] %{GREEDYDATA:message}\", lucene: \"\\\"plugin.type\\\":\\\"ktranslate-health\\\"\", nrql: \"SELECT * FROM Log WHERE `plugin.type` = 'ktranslate-health'\" } ) { errors { message type } rule { accountId id enabled description grok lucene nrql } } } Copy The result of this parsing rule is splitting a raw message from this: { \"collector.name\": \"ktranslate\", \"instrumentation.provider\": \"kentik\", \"message\": \"2021-12-08T14:59:56.007 ktranslate/snmp [Info] nrmFormat New Metadata for cisco-7513\", \"newrelic.source\": \"api.logs\", \"plugin.type\": \"ktranslate-health\", \"timestamp\": 1638975596000 } Copy To this, creating the searchable fields of container_service, severity, and time; as well as trimming the message field to more actionable data: { \"collector.name\": \"ktranslate\", \"container_service\": \"snmp\", \"instrumentation.provider\": \"kentik\", \"message\": \"nrmFormat New Metadata for cisco-7513\", \"newrelic.source\": \"api.logs\", \"plugin.type\": \"ktranslate-health\", \"severity\": \"Info\", \"time\": \"2021-12-08T15:29:56.026\", \"timestamp\": 1638977396000 } Copy Common log searches Below are some common searches that can be used during troubleshooting to gather data for support: What version of ktranslate am I running? Logs UI: bash Copy $ collector.name:\"ktranslate\" message:\"*KTranslate Running -- Version*\" NRQL: FROM Log SELECT * WHERE `collector.name` = 'ktranslate' AND `message` LIKE '%KTranslate Running -- Version%' Copy Expected Results: bash Copy $ KTranslate Running -- Version kt-2021-12-06-1546870234; Build Mon Dec 6 22:22:56 UTC 2021 What arguments were passed to Docker at runtime? Logs UI: bash Copy $ collector.name:\"ktranslate\" message:\"*KTranslate CLI:*\" NRQL: FROM Log SELECT * WHERE `collector.name` = 'ktranslate' AND `message` LIKE '%KTranslate CLI:%' Copy Expected Results: bash Copy $ KTranslate CLI: [ktranslate -listen off -mapping /etc/ktranslate/config.json -geo /etc/ktranslate/GeoLite2-Country.mmdb -udrs /etc/ktranslate/udr.csv -api_devices /etc/ktranslate/devices.json -asn /etc/ktranslate/GeoLite2-ASN.mmdb -log_level info -snmp /snmp-base.yaml -nr_account_id=2583772 -log_level=info -metrics=jchf -tee_logs=true -service_name=snmp nr1.snmp] What errors am I experiencing? Without a parsing rule applied to your logs Logs UI: bash Copy $ collector.name:\"ktranslate\" message:-*\\[Info\\]* NRQL: FROM Log SELECT * WHERE `collector.name` = 'ktranslate' AND `message` NOT LIKE '%[Info]%' Copy With a parsing rule applied to your logs Logs UI: bash Copy $ collector.name:\"ktranslate\" severity:-\"Info\" NRQL: FROM Log SELECT * WHERE `collector.name` = 'ktranslate' AND `severity` != 'Info' Copy Expected Results: bash Copy $ KTranslate>cisco-7513 There was an SNMP polling error with the CustomDeviceMetrics walking OID .1.3.6.1.2.1.4.31.1.1.21 after 0 retries: request timeout (after 0 retries). Is my match_attributes filter working on my device? Logs UI: bash Copy $ collector.name:\"ktranslate\" message:\"*Match Attribute*\" NRQL: FROM Log SELECT * WHERE `collector.name` = 'ktranslate' AND `message` LIKE '%Match Attribute%' Copy Expected Results: bash Copy $ KTranslate>cisco-7513 Added 1 Match Attribute(s) All devices are expected to have at least 1 Match Attribute inherited from the default monitor_admin_shut: true configuration. You should expect a value of 2 to be shown for a device that you have added a single match attribute to. Tip You can further filter these results by adding the device name to your query: collector.name:\"ktranslate\" message:\"*$DEVICE_NAME*Match Attribute*\". Metrics from ktranslate The -metrics option captures the following performance metrics when polling devices: Metric Granularity Description baseserver_healthcheck_execution_total Top Level Rate of internal health checks. Shows mostly that things are not deadlocked and should always be greater than 0. inputq Top Level Messages per second (msg/sec) received over the last 60 seconds from all SNMP, Flow, and VPC inputs combined. jchfq Top Level Gauge rate with number of available pre-allocated buffers. It should be about 8,000. delivery_metrics_nr Delivery to New Relic One Batches per second (batches/sec) sent over the last 60 seconds for all metrics to New Relic One. delivery_logs_nr Delivery to New Relic One Logs per second (logs/sec) sent over the last 60 seconds for all logs to New Relic One. delivery_wins_nr Delivery to New Relic One Wins per second (wins/sec) of 200 HTTP codes received over the last 60 seconds from sending metrics and events to New Relic One. device_metrics SNMP Polls per second (polls/sec) of SNMP polling over the last 60 seconds for device level metrics. interface_metrics SNMP Polls per second (polls/sec) of SNMP polling over the last 60 seconds for interface level metrics. snmp_fail SNMP Gauge to monitor if SNMP polling is working faceted by device_name. Where 1 means good and 2 means fail. netflow.flows Netflow Flows per second (fps) received over the last 60 seconds for all device flow data: IPFIX, NetFlow, or sFlow. syslog_queue Syslog Gauge of syslog messages waiting to be processed. syslog_errors Syslog Errors per second (errors/sec) over the last 60 seconds while processing syslog messages. syslog_messages Syslog Messages per second (msg/sec) received over the last 60 seconds for all syslog data.

Optional external config files To support a wide variety of configuration and automation needs, you can use external files that you volume mount into your Docker container to decouple certain elements of the standard configuration file. The syntax for these files is \"@fileName.extension\", including the double quotes. Discovery CIDRs Example: discovery: cidrs: \"@cidrs.yaml\" Copy The CIDRs file should use a YAML list syntax like this: - 10.10.0.0/24 - 10.20.0.0/24 - 192.168.0.21/32 Copy Devices Example: devices: - \"@neteng-devices.yaml\" - \"@dc-ops.yaml\" Copy The device files should use the same syntax as the standard devices section of the main config file, omitting the optional fields that are generated during discovery: devices: # Sample of SNMP v2c device ups_snmpv2c__10.10.0.201: device_name: ups_snmpv2c device_ip: 10.10.0.201 snmp_comm: public oid: .1.3.6.1.4.1.318.1.3.27 mib_profile: apc_ups.yml provider: kentik-ups poll_time_sec: 300 retries: 1 timeout_ms: 5000 user_tags: owning_team: dc_ops Copy The match_attributes attribute To support filtering of data that does not create value for your observability needs, you can set the global.match_attributes.{} and/or devices.<deviceName>.match_attributes.{} attribute map. This will provide filtering at the ktranslate level, before shipping data to New Relic, giving you granular control over monitoring of things like interfaces. The default behavior of this map is an OR condition, but you can override this and force an AND operator by prefixing your key name with !. This is also useful to return only matched items and omit all null and \"\" (empty) results. Default 'OR' with null and empty values Match when if_Alias begins with Uplink OR when if_interface_name begins with Gig, keep all null and \"\" values: devices: deviceName: ... match_attributes: if_Alias: \"^Uplink.*\" if_interface_name: \"^Gig.*\" Copy 'AND', omit null and empty values Match when if_Alias begins with Uplink AND when if_interface_name begins with Gig, drop all null and \"\" values: devices: deviceName: ... match_attributes: if_Alias: \"^Uplink.*\" \"!if_interface_name\": \"^Gig.*\" Copy Single match, omit null and empty values Match when if_Alias begins with Uplink, drop all null and \"\" values: devices: deviceName: ... match_attributes: \"!if_Alias\": \"^Uplink.*\" Copy The flow_only attribute To support monitoring of devices where performance statistics are nor accessible, available, or desired, you can set the devices.<deviceName>.flow_only attribute to true. This will generate a Flow Device entity in New Relic One which will only have telemetry in the KFlow event namespace. Alternatively, collecting flow telemetry from a device that is in your configuration file as an SNMP device will add decoration of the KFlow data to the pre-existing entity, such as a Router or Firewall. In New Relic One, you can see the results of this polling by investigating the following events: FROM KFlow SELECT count(*) FACET device_name WHERE instrumentation.name = 'netflow-events' TIMESERIES Copy The response_time and ping_only attributes To support monitoring of devices where performance statistics are not accessible or available, or in simple cases where basic round-trip time (RTT) monitoring is required, you can either set the global.response_time or devices.<deviceName>.ping_only attributes to true. This feature uses the go-ping package to send unprivileged UDP packets to devices in order to collect the average, min, and max RTT for the endpoint based on sending 1 packet/sec from ktranslate to the device IP address. Setting the global.response_time attribute to true will add RTT monitoring on top of existing SNMP polling. devices.<deviceName>.ping_only: true will allow you to monitor devices with only the UDP packets for RTT and no SNMP polling. In New Relic One, you can see the results of this polling by investigating the following metrics: FROM Metric SELECT average(kentik.ping.AvgRttMs) AS 'Average', max(kentik.ping.MaxRttMs) AS 'Max', min(kentik.ping.MinRttMs) AS 'Min' FACET device_name TIMESERIES Copy Tip You can use the ping_only attribute in replacement of the flow_only attribute if you would like to collect RTT metrics from a flow device. If both ping_only and flow_only are true, the device will be treated as a flow_only device. Flow data application mapping By default, flow telemetry is mapped to known applications based on evaluation of the layer 4 port in use on a specific flow conversation. If needed, you can override the default mapping by providing a YAML file during Docker runtime to the -application_map flag. This will allow you to specify application names based on ports you identify. Example syntax: applications: - ports: [9092, 9093] name: kafka - ports: [80, 8080] name: http - ports: [443, 8443] name: https Copy Flow data input filtering By default, flow data containers will collect and process every flow packet they receive. If needed, you can add an inclusion filter to the -nf.source flag that will ignore all traffic not matching the filter you provide.

      "body": "Profiles define what SNMP OIDs we want to collect and send to your New Relic account. This document explains how to modify an existing profile or create a new profile. Get started If you've decided to build a custom profile or modify one of our open source profiles, you need a few essential tools: A GitHub account: This enables you to raise issues and contribute changes to Kentik's open source profiles. An SNMP walk from a network device where you want to work on a profile. For more information, see our documentation on setting up SNMP and using snmpwalk. Permissions to perform Docker pull on the server that hosts your ktranslate container. This document covers: Making requests for new or modified profiles through GitHub to be worked on by the maintainers Contributing your own profiles and modifications publicly Using custom profiles privately Tip Support for all things relating to kentik/snmp-profiles is handled through GitHub issues. New Relic technical support is not able to provide any additional help beyond redirecting you back to raise an issue there. Make requests through GitHub This is the most common and simple scenario, for cases where you don't have the time or expertise with SNMP to do these yourself. After you provide the relevant data, our team will build the profile for you. Log into GitHub and go to the snmp-profiles repo. Click the Issues tab near the top. Click New issue. To request a new profile, look for the SNMP Profile Request section, and click Get started. Provide all requested information in the template, such as the device vendor, model, snmp object identifier, and a sanitized SNMP walk. For all other requests, use Open a blank issue. Tip Providing an SNMP walk is critical as we cannot do any work on the profile without these. This is not the same as an MIB file. The maintainers of the repo will review the information you provided and, if there is anything missing, they will follow up with you. Once all the necessary data is provided, they will add it to the queue of profiles to be built. After it is added to the repo, the issue will be closed, and all you have to do is update the ktranslate docker container on your end, and the newest profiles will automatically be loaded. Contribute profiles and modifications publicly We gladly accept contributions from anyone who wants to help out to either create new profiles or improve the existing profiles. To familiarize yourself with the structure of a profile, review this highly commented template.yml on GitHub. Log into GitHub and go to the snmp-profiles repo. To create a copy of the same information in your account, click the fork button near the top. Within your fork,make necessary changes to the files, or create new vendor directories and profiles as needed. Be sure to pass your profile through a YAML validator, such as codebeautify, before submitting a pull request. When you are done with your changes, submit a pull request to the upstream repo. The maintainers will review the change, and discuss any necessary feedback. When everyone is aligned, it will be merged. Shortly after a merge, new SNMP profiles are automatically available by pulling the new version of the Docker image and launching a new container in your environment. For more information, see our documentation about SNMP manual setup. Tip Be sure to sync your fork regularly to keep it up to date with changes in the upstream repo. What kinds of OIDs should I actually include in a profile? In many cases SNMP offers a lot of data, but much of that data does not provide actionable information. Or, the data provides value that is so uncommon and low impact, it might not be worth bringing into your New Relic account. You want to focus on collecting data that lets you know if there is anything that would stop the device from being able to perform whatever functions you expect it to perform. Building on from that, you should collect measurements that tell you how well it is performing those functions. Example 1: For a device operating as a VPN concentrator, we would collect high-level system metrics like: CPU and memory utilization Hardware sensor information to make sure that the device isn't going to shut itself down due to things like fan failures OIDs that tell us about the aggregated connections and throughput Example 2: An example of data that is available but provides very poor value is an OID table that lists all the running processes on a network appliance. Coming from a server admin perspective, that might sound useful, but since this is an appliance, you normally do not have the capability or the need to do anything with the processes that run inside it. Polling and storing tables with hundreds of items that you can't actually do anything with would not be efficient. Use custom profiles privately For cases where you want to make a change to a profile, but you know that it is a scenario that is very unique and would not apply to other customers you can locally edit the profiles. The way this is done is by using Docker's volume mount to pass in your customized files to the ktranslate container inside the etc/ktranslate/profiles/ directory. There are other ways you could accomplish this but in this example we will demonstrate using a git fork and clone. Ensure you are in the directory you want to keep the files in, then clone your fork of the GitHub repo to your Docker host: git clone https://github.com/<YourGitUser>/snmp-profiles.git Copy Get the command you would normally use to launch the SNMP container, and add a second volume mount argument after the one where we passed in the snmp-base.yaml. -v `pwd`/snmp-profiles/profiles:/etc/ktranslate/profiles \\ Copy The mount command replaces the built-in profiles directory with your customized data. The end result will be be similar to this: docker run -ti --name ktranslate-discovery --rm --net=host \\ --user `id -u`:`id -g` \\ -v `pwd`/snmp-base.yaml:/snmp-base.yaml \\ -v `pwd`/snmp-profiles/profiles:/etc/ktranslate/profiles \\ kentik/ktranslate:v2 \\ -snmp /snmp-base.yaml \\ -log_level info \\ -snmp_discovery=true Copy Tip Be sure to pass your custom version of the profiles in every time you launch a discovery container or SNMP polling container. If you don't use it consistently for all SNMP instances sets, this can cause unreliable behavior.",

      "body": "While running the ktranslate Docker container for New Relic network performance monitoring, you can monitor the health of the container to proactively detect potential issues. The ktranslate container image has the -tee_logs=true and -metrics=jchf settings available during runtime, which allow it to send health metrics into New Relic One directly. These are enabled by default when installing network performance monitoring via the New Relic One guided install. We recommend you to set them up when installing network performance monitoring manually. Logs from ktranslate Tip If you want to check the logs locally from the Docker host, run docker logs $CONTAINER_NAME. For example, docker logs ktranslate-snmp. The -tee_logs=true option sends logs to New Relic One when polling devices. To see them, do the following: Go to one.newrelic.com > Logs. In Find logs where, enter collector.name:\"ktranslate\" and click Query logs. Optional log parsing rule We recommend you to add a parsing rule to New Relic One logs to break the logs from ktranslate into fields that are easily searchable. This is especially helpful when you are running more than one container as it allows you to then search by the value of --service_name from the Docker container. Using the New Relic One logs UI, use the following patterns: Rule Name: ktranslate-health logs Query Attribute: \"plugin.type\" Query Value: \"ktranslate-health\" Parsing logic: %{NOTSPACE:time} ktranslate/%{NOTSPACE:container_service} \\[%{NOTSPACE:severity}\\] %{GREEDYDATA:message} Copy Alternatively, you can use New Relic's Nerdgraph API to manage your parsing rules. A sample of the logConfigurationsCreateParsingRule is below, you will need to replace $ACCOUNT_ID with the ID of your target account. mutation { logConfigurationsCreateParsingRule( accountId: $ACCOUNT_ID, rule: { description: \"ktranslate-health logs\", enabled: true, grok: \"%{NOTSPACE:time} ktranslate/%{NOTSPACE:container_service} \\\\[%{NOTSPACE:severity}\\\\] %{GREEDYDATA:message}\", lucene: \"\\\"plugin.type\\\":\\\"ktranslate-health\\\"\", nrql: \"SELECT * FROM Log WHERE `plugin.type` = 'ktranslate-health'\" } ) { errors { message type } rule { accountId id enabled description grok lucene nrql } } } Copy The result of this parsing rule is splitting a raw message from this: { \"collector.name\": \"ktranslate\", \"instrumentation.provider\": \"kentik\", \"message\": \"2021-12-08T14:59:56.007 ktranslate/snmp [Info] nrmFormat New Metadata for cisco-7513\", \"newrelic.source\": \"api.logs\", \"plugin.type\": \"ktranslate-health\", \"timestamp\": 1638975596000 } Copy To this, creating the searchable fields of container_service, severity, and time; as well as trimming the message field to more actionable data: { \"collector.name\": \"ktranslate\", \"container_service\": \"snmp\", \"instrumentation.provider\": \"kentik\", \"message\": \"nrmFormat New Metadata for cisco-7513\", \"newrelic.source\": \"api.logs\", \"plugin.type\": \"ktranslate-health\", \"severity\": \"Info\", \"time\": \"2021-12-08T15:29:56.026\", \"timestamp\": 1638977396000 } Copy Common log searches Below are some common searches that can be used during troubleshooting to gather data for support: What version of ktranslate am I running? Logs UI: bash Copy $ collector.name:\"ktranslate\" message:\"*KTranslate Running -- Version*\" NRQL: FROM Log SELECT * WHERE `collector.name` = 'ktranslate' AND `message` LIKE '%KTranslate Running -- Version%' Copy Expected Results: bash Copy $ KTranslate Running -- Version kt-2021-12-06-1546870234; Build Mon Dec 6 22:22:56 UTC 2021 What arguments were passed to Docker at runtime?

Without a parsing rule applied to your logs Logs UI: bash Copy $ collector.name:\"ktranslate\" message:-*\\[Info\\]* NRQL: FROM Log SELECT * WHERE `collector.name` = 'ktranslate' AND `message` NOT LIKE '%[Info]%' Copy With a parsing rule applied to your logs Logs UI: bash Copy $ collector.name:\"ktranslate\" severity:-\"Info\" NRQL: FROM Log SELECT * WHERE `collector.name` = 'ktranslate' AND `severity` != 'Info' Copy Expected Results: bash Copy $ KTranslate>cisco-7513 There was an SNMP polling error with the CustomDeviceMetrics walking OID .1.3.6.1.2.1.4.31.1.1.21 after 0 retries: request timeout (after 0 retries). Is my match_attributes filter working on my device? Logs UI: bash Copy $ collector.name:\"ktranslate\" message:\"*Match Attribute*\" NRQL: FROM Log SELECT * WHERE `collector.name` = 'ktranslate' AND `message` LIKE '%Match Attribute%' Copy Expected Results: bash Copy $ KTranslate>cisco-7513 Added 1 Match Attribute(s) All devices are expected to have at least 1 Match Attribute inherited from the default monitor_admin_shut: true configuration. You should expect a value of 2 to be shown for a device that you have added a single match attribute to. Tip You can further filter these results by adding the device name to your query: collector.name:\"ktranslate\" message:\"*$DEVICE_NAME*Match Attribute*\". Metrics from ktranslate The -metrics option captures the following performance metrics when polling devices: Metric Granularity Description baseserver_healthcheck_execution_total Top Level Rate of internal health checks. Shows mostly that things are not deadlocked and should always be greater than 0. inputq Top Level Messages per second (msg/sec) received over the last 60 seconds from all SNMP, Flow, and VPC inputs combined. jchfq Top Level Gauge rate with number of available pre-allocated buffers. It should be about 8,000. delivery_metrics_nr Delivery to New Relic One Batches per second (batches/sec) sent over the last 60 seconds for all metrics to New Relic One. delivery_logs_nr Delivery to New Relic One Logs per second (logs/sec) sent over the last 60 seconds for all logs to New Relic One. delivery_wins_nr Delivery to New Relic One Wins per second (wins/sec) of 200 HTTP codes received over the last 60 seconds from sending metrics and events to New Relic One. device_metrics SNMP Polls per second (polls/sec) of SNMP polling over the last 60 seconds for device level metrics. interface_metrics SNMP Polls per second (polls/sec) of SNMP polling over the last 60 seconds for interface level metrics. snmp_fail SNMP Gauge to monitor if SNMP polling is working faceted by device_name. Where 1 means good and 2 means fail. netflow.flows Netflow Flows per second (fps) received over the last 60 seconds for all device flow data: IPFIX, NetFlow, or sFlow. syslog_queue Syslog Gauge of syslog messages waiting to be processed. syslog_errors Syslog Errors per second (errors/sec) over the last 60 seconds while processing syslog messages. syslog_messages Syslog Messages per second (msg/sec) received over the last 60 seconds for all syslog data. Common metrics searches To see these metrics in New Relic One: Go to one.newrelic.com and click Query your data. Enter one of the following NRQL queries: What are the current versions of my ktranslate applications?

Optional external config files To support a wide variety of configuration and automation needs, you can use external files that you volume mount into your Docker container to decouple certain elements of the standard configuration file. The syntax for these files is \"@fileName.extension\", including the double quotes. Discovery CIDRs Example: discovery: cidrs: \"@cidrs.yaml\" Copy The CIDRs file should use a YAML list syntax like this: - 10.10.0.0/24 - 10.20.0.0/24 - 192.168.0.21/32 Copy Devices Example: devices: - \"@neteng-devices.yaml\" - \"@dc-ops.yaml\" Copy The device files should use the same syntax as the standard devices section of the main config file, omitting the optional fields that are generated during discovery: devices: # Sample of SNMP v2c device ups_snmpv2c__10.10.0.201: device_name: ups_snmpv2c device_ip: 10.10.0.201 snmp_comm: public oid: .1.3.6.1.4.1.318.1.3.27 mib_profile: apc_ups.yml provider: kentik-ups poll_time_sec: 300 retries: 1 timeout_ms: 5000 user_tags: owning_team: dc_ops Copy The match_attributes attribute To support filtering of data that does not create value for your observability needs, you can set the global.match_attributes.{} and/or devices.<deviceName>.match_attributes.{} attribute map. This will provide filtering at the ktranslate level, before shipping data to New Relic, giving you granular control over monitoring of things like interfaces. The default behavior of this map is an OR condition, but you can override this and force an AND operator by prefixing your key name with !. This is also useful to return only matched items and omit all null and \"\" (empty) results. Default 'OR' with null and empty values Match when if_Alias begins with Uplink OR when if_interface_name begins with Gig, keep all null and \"\" values: devices: deviceName: ... match_attributes: if_Alias: \"^Uplink.*\" if_interface_name: \"^Gig.*\" Copy 'AND', omit null and empty values Match when if_Alias begins with Uplink AND when if_interface_name begins with Gig, drop all null and \"\" values: devices: deviceName: ... match_attributes: if_Alias: \"^Uplink.*\" \"!if_interface_name\": \"^Gig.*\" Copy Single match, omit null and empty values Match when if_Alias begins with Uplink, drop all null and \"\" values: devices: deviceName: ... match_attributes: \"!if_Alias\": \"^Uplink.*\" Copy The flow_only attribute To support monitoring of devices where performance statistics are nor accessible, available, or desired, you can set the devices.<deviceName>.flow_only attribute to true. This will generate a Flow Device entity in New Relic One which will only have telemetry in the KFlow event namespace. Alternatively, collecting flow telemetry from a device that is in your configuration file as an SNMP device will add decoration of the KFlow data to the pre-existing entity, such as a Router or Firewall. In New Relic One, you can see the results of this polling by investigating the following events: FROM KFlow SELECT count(*) FACET device_name WHERE instrumentation.name = 'netflow-events' TIMESERIES Copy The response_time and ping_only attributes To support monitoring of devices where performance statistics are not accessible or available, or in simple cases where basic round-trip time (RTT) monitoring is required, you can either set the global.response_time or devices.<deviceName>.ping_only attributes to true. This feature uses the go-ping package to send unprivileged UDP packets to devices in order to collect the average, min, and max RTT for the endpoint based on sending 1 packet/sec from ktranslate to the device IP address. Setting the global.response_time attribute to true will add RTT monitoring on top of existing SNMP polling. devices.<deviceName>.ping_only: true will allow you to monitor devices with only the UDP packets for RTT and no SNMP polling. In New Relic One, you can see the results of this polling by investigating the following metrics: FROM Metric SELECT average(kentik.ping.AvgRttMs) AS 'Average', max(kentik.ping.MaxRttMs) AS 'Max', min(kentik.ping.MinRttMs) AS 'Min' FACET device_name TIMESERIES Copy Tip You can use the ping_only attribute in replacement of the flow_only attribute if you would like to collect RTT metrics from a flow device. If both ping_only and flow_only are true, the device will be treated as a flow_only device. Flow data application mapping By default, flow telemetry is mapped to known applications based on evaluation of the layer 4 port in use on a specific flow conversation. If needed, you can override the default mapping by providing a YAML file during Docker runtime to the -application_map flag. This will allow you to specify application names based on ports you identify. Example syntax: applications: - ports: [9092, 9093] name: kafka - ports: [80, 8080] name: http - ports: [443, 8443] name: https Copy Flow data input filtering By default, flow data containers will collect and process every flow packet they receive. If needed, you can add an inclusion filter to the -nf.source flag that will ignore all traffic not matching the filter you provide. Syntax: --filters $TYPE,$FIELD,$FUNCTION,$MATCH Argument Name Required Description $TYPE ✓ The type of filter to apply. Possible values are string, int, and addr. $FIELD ✓ The name of the field to evaluate the match pattern against. $FUNCTION ✓ The type of function to use during evaluation. Possible values are Equal: ==, NotEqual: !=, LessThan: <, GreaterThan: >, Contains: % $MATCH ✓ The value to be used as a match pattern. Example Filters Only collect flow data from source addresses in the 10.0.0.0/24 CIDR range -nf.source sflow --filters addr,src_addr,%,10.10.0.0/24 Copy Only collect flow data where the destination port is not equal to 8531 -nf.source netflow5 --filters int,l4_dst_port,!=,8531 Copy You can also add multiple filters together with an inherited AND operator Only collect flow data from source addresses in the 10.0.0.0/24 CIDR range AND where the destination port is not equal to 8531 --filters addr,src_addr,%,10.0.0.0/24 --filters int,l4_dst_port,!=,8531 Copy",

      "body": "Profiles define what SNMP OIDs we want to collect and send to your New Relic account. This document explains how to modify an existing profile or create a new profile. Get started If you've decided to build a custom profile or modify one of our open source profiles, you need a few essential tools: A GitHub account: This enables you to raise issues and contribute changes to Kentik's open source profiles. An SNMP walk from a network device where you want to work on a profile. For more information, see our documentation on setting up SNMP and using snmpwalk. Permissions to perform Docker pull on the server that hosts your ktranslate container. This document covers: Making requests for new or modified profiles through GitHub to be worked on by the maintainers Contributing your own profiles and modifications publicly Using custom profiles privately Tip Support for all things relating to kentik/snmp-profiles is handled through GitHub issues. New Relic technical support is not able to provide any additional help beyond redirecting you back to raise an issue there. Make requests through GitHub This is the most common and simple scenario, for cases where you don't have the time or expertise with SNMP to do these yourself. After you provide the relevant data, our team will build the profile for you. Log into GitHub and go to the snmp-profiles repo. Click the Issues tab near the top. Click New issue. To request a new profile, look for the SNMP Profile Request section, and click Get started. Provide all requested information in the template, such as the device vendor, model, snmp object identifier, and a sanitized SNMP walk. For all other requests, use Open a blank issue. Tip Providing an SNMP walk is critical as we cannot do any work on the profile without these. This is not the same as an MIB file. The maintainers of the repo will review the information you provided and, if there is anything missing, they will follow up with you. Once all the necessary data is provided, they will add it to the queue of profiles to be built. After it is added to the repo, the issue will be closed, and all you have to do is update the ktranslate docker container on your end, and the newest profiles will automatically be loaded. Contribute profiles and modifications publicly We gladly accept contributions from anyone who wants to help out to either create new profiles or improve the existing profiles. To familiarize yourself with the structure of a profile, review this highly commented template.yml on GitHub. Log into GitHub and go to the snmp-profiles repo. To create a copy of the same information in your account, click the fork button near the top. Within your fork,make necessary changes to the files, or create new vendor directories and profiles as needed. Be sure to pass your profile through a YAML validator, such as codebeautify, before submitting a pull request. When you are done with your changes, submit a pull request to the upstream repo. The maintainers will review the change, and discuss any necessary feedback. When everyone is aligned, it will be merged. Shortly after a merge, new SNMP profiles are automatically available by pulling the new version of the Docker image and launching a new container in your environment. For more information, see our documentation about SNMP manual setup. Tip Be sure to sync your fork regularly to keep it up to date with changes in the upstream repo. What kinds of OIDs should I actually include in a profile? In many cases SNMP offers a lot of data, but much of that data does not provide actionable information. Or, the data provides value that is so uncommon and low impact, it might not be worth bringing into your New Relic account. You want to focus on collecting data that lets you know if there is anything that would stop the device from being able to perform whatever functions you expect it to perform. Building on from that, you should collect measurements that tell you how well it is performing those functions. Example 1: For a device operating as a VPN concentrator, we would collect high-level system metrics like: CPU and memory utilization Hardware sensor information to make sure that the device isn't going to shut itself down due to things like fan failures OIDs that tell us about the aggregated connections and throughput Example 2: An example of data that is available but provides very poor value is an OID table that lists all the running processes on a network appliance. Coming from a server admin perspective, that might sound useful, but since this is an appliance, you normally do not have the capability or the need to do anything with the processes that run inside it. Polling and storing tables with hundreds of items that you can't actually do anything with would not be efficient. Use custom profiles privately For cases where you want to make a change to a profile, but you know that it is a scenario that is very unique and would not apply to other customers you can locally edit the profiles. The way this is done is by using Docker's volume mount to pass in your customized files to the ktranslate container inside the etc/ktranslate/profiles/ directory. There are other ways you could accomplish this but in this example we will demonstrate using a git fork and clone. Ensure you are in the directory you want to keep the files in, then clone your fork of the GitHub repo to your Docker host: git clone https://github.com/<YourGitUser>/snmp-profiles.git Copy Get the command you would normally use to launch the SNMP container, and add a second volume mount argument after the one where we passed in the snmp-base.yaml. -v `pwd`/snmp-profiles/profiles:/etc/ktranslate/profiles \\ Copy The mount command replaces the built-in profiles directory with your customized data. The end result will be be similar to this: docker run -ti --name ktranslate-discovery --rm --net=host \\ --user `id -u`:`id -g` \\ -v `pwd`/snmp-base.yaml:/snmp-base.yaml \\ -v `pwd`/snmp-profiles/profiles:/etc/ktranslate/profiles \\ kentik/ktranslate:v2 \\ -snmp /snmp-base.yaml \\ -log_level info \\ -snmp_discovery=true Copy Tip Be sure to pass your custom version of the profiles in every time you launch a discovery container or SNMP polling container. If you don't use it consistently for all SNMP instances sets, this can cause unreliable behavior.",

Logs from ktranslate Tip If you want to check the logs locally from the Docker host, run docker logs $CONTAINER_NAME. For example, docker logs ktranslate-snmp. The -tee_logs=true option sends logs to New Relic One when polling devices. To see them, do the following: Go to one.newrelic.com > Logs. In Find logs where, enter collector.name:\"ktranslate\" and click Query logs. Optional log parsing rule We recommend you to add a parsing rule to New Relic One logs to break the logs from ktranslate into fields that are easily searchable. This is especially helpful when you are running more than one container as it allows you to then search by the value of --service_name from the Docker container. Using the New Relic One logs UI, use the following patterns: Rule Name: ktranslate-health logs Query Attribute: \"plugin.type\" Query Value: \"ktranslate-health\" Parsing logic: %{NOTSPACE:time} ktranslate/%{NOTSPACE:container_service} \\[%{NOTSPACE:severity}\\] %{GREEDYDATA:message} Copy Alternatively, you can use New Relic's Nerdgraph API to manage your parsing rules. A sample of the logConfigurationsCreateParsingRule is below, you will need to replace $ACCOUNT_ID with the ID of your target account. mutation { logConfigurationsCreateParsingRule( accountId: $ACCOUNT_ID, rule: { description: \"ktranslate-health logs\", enabled: true, grok: \"%{NOTSPACE:time} ktranslate/%{NOTSPACE:container_service} \\\\[%{NOTSPACE:severity}\\\\] %{GREEDYDATA:message}\", lucene: \"\\\"plugin.type\\\":\\\"ktranslate-health\\\"\", nrql: \"SELECT * FROM Log WHERE `plugin.type` = 'ktranslate-health'\" } ) { errors { message type } rule { accountId id enabled description grok lucene nrql } } } Copy The result of this parsing rule is splitting a raw message from this: { \"collector.name\": \"ktranslate\", \"instrumentation.provider\": \"kentik\", \"message\": \"2021-12-08T14:59:56.007 ktranslate/snmp [Info] nrmFormat New Metadata for cisco-7513\", \"newrelic.source\": \"api.logs\", \"plugin.type\": \"ktranslate-health\", \"timestamp\": 1638975596000 } Copy To this, creating the searchable fields of container_service, severity, and time; as well as trimming the message field to more actionable data: { \"collector.name\": \"ktranslate\", \"container_service\": \"snmp\", \"instrumentation.provider\": \"kentik\", \"message\": \"nrmFormat New Metadata for cisco-7513\", \"newrelic.source\": \"api.logs\", \"plugin.type\": \"ktranslate-health\", \"severity\": \"Info\", \"time\": \"2021-12-08T15:29:56.026\", \"timestamp\": 1638977396000 } Copy Common log searches Below are some common searches that can be used during troubleshooting to gather data for support: What version of ktranslate am I running? Logs UI: bash Copy $ collector.name:\"ktranslate\" message:\"*KTranslate Running -- Version*\" NRQL: FROM Log SELECT * WHERE `collector.name` = 'ktranslate' AND `message` LIKE '%KTranslate Running -- Version%' Copy Expected Results: bash Copy $ KTranslate Running -- Version kt-2021-12-06-1546870234; Build Mon Dec 6 22:22:56 UTC 2021 What arguments were passed to Docker at runtime? Logs UI: bash Copy $ collector.name:\"ktranslate\" message:\"*KTranslate CLI:*\" NRQL: FROM Log SELECT * WHERE `collector.name` = 'ktranslate' AND `message` LIKE '%KTranslate CLI:%' Copy Expected Results: bash Copy $ KTranslate CLI: [ktranslate -listen off -mapping /etc/ktranslate/config.json -geo /etc/ktranslate/GeoLite2-Country.mmdb -udrs /etc/ktranslate/udr.csv -api_devices /etc/ktranslate/devices.json -asn /etc/ktranslate/GeoLite2-ASN.mmdb -log_level info -snmp /snmp-base.yaml -nr_account_id=2583772 -log_level=info -metrics=jchf -tee_logs=true -service_name=snmp nr1.snmp] What errors am I experiencing? Without a parsing rule applied to your logs Logs UI: bash Copy $ collector.name:\"ktranslate\" message:-*\\[Info\\]* NRQL: FROM Log SELECT * WHERE `collector.name` = 'ktranslate' AND `message` NOT LIKE '%[Info]%' Copy With a parsing rule applied to your logs Logs UI: bash Copy $ collector.name:\"ktranslate\" severity:-\"Info\" NRQL: FROM Log SELECT * WHERE `collector.name` = 'ktranslate' AND `severity` != 'Info' Copy Expected Results: bash Copy $ KTranslate>cisco-7513 There was an SNMP polling error with the CustomDeviceMetrics walking OID .1.3.6.1.2.1.4.31.1.1.21 after 0 retries: request timeout (after 0 retries). Is my match_attributes filter working on my device? Logs UI: bash Copy $ collector.name:\"ktranslate\" message:\"*Match Attribute*\" NRQL: FROM Log SELECT * WHERE `collector.name` = 'ktranslate' AND `message` LIKE '%Match Attribute%' Copy Expected Results: bash Copy $ KTranslate>cisco-7513 Added 1 Match Attribute(s) All devices are expected to have at least 1 Match Attribute inherited from the default monitor_admin_shut: true configuration. You should expect a value of 2 to be shown for a device that you have added a single match attribute to. Tip You can further filter these results by adding the device name to your query: collector.name:\"ktranslate\" message:\"*$DEVICE_NAME*Match Attribute*\". Metrics from ktranslate The -metrics option captures the following performance metrics when polling devices: Metric Granularity Description baseserver_healthcheck_execution_total Top Level Rate of internal health checks. Shows mostly that things are not deadlocked and should always be greater than 0. inputq Top Level Messages per second (msg/sec) received over the last 60 seconds from all SNMP, Flow, and VPC inputs combined. jchfq Top Level Gauge rate with number of available pre-allocated buffers. It should be about 8,000. delivery_metrics_nr Delivery to New Relic One Batches per second (batches/sec) sent over the last 60 seconds for all metrics to New Relic One. delivery_logs_nr Delivery to New Relic One Logs per second (logs/sec) sent over the last 60 seconds for all logs to New Relic One. delivery_wins_nr Delivery to New Relic One Wins per second (wins/sec) of 200 HTTP codes received over the last 60 seconds from sending metrics and events to New Relic One. device_metrics SNMP Polls per second (polls/sec) of SNMP polling over the last 60 seconds for device level metrics. interface_metrics SNMP Polls per second (polls/sec) of SNMP polling over the last 60 seconds for interface level metrics. snmp_fail SNMP Gauge to monitor if SNMP polling is working faceted by device_name. Where 1 means good and 2 means fail. netflow.flows Netflow Flows per second (fps) received over the last 60 seconds for all device flow data: IPFIX, NetFlow, or sFlow. syslog_queue Syslog Gauge of syslog messages waiting to be processed. syslog_errors Syslog Errors per second (errors/sec) over the last 60 seconds while processing syslog messages. syslog_messages Syslog Messages per second (msg/sec) received over the last 60 seconds for all syslog data. Common metrics searches To see these metrics in New Relic One: Go to one.newrelic.com and click Query your data. Enter one of the following NRQL queries: What are the current versions of my ktranslate applications?

Optional external config files To support a wide variety of configuration and automation needs, you can use external files that you volume mount into your Docker container to decouple certain elements of the standard configuration file. The syntax for these files is \"@fileName.extension\", including the double quotes. Discovery CIDRs Example: discovery: cidrs: \"@cidrs.yaml\" Copy The CIDRs file should use a YAML list syntax like this: - 10.10.0.0/24 - 10.20.0.0/24 - 192.168.0.21/32 Copy Devices Example: devices: - \"@neteng-devices.yaml\" - \"@dc-ops.yaml\" Copy The device files should use the same syntax as the standard devices section of the main config file, omitting the optional fields that are generated during discovery: devices: # Sample of SNMP v2c device ups_snmpv2c__10.10.0.201: device_name: ups_snmpv2c device_ip: 10.10.0.201 snmp_comm: public oid: .1.3.6.1.4.1.318.1.3.27 mib_profile: apc_ups.yml provider: kentik-ups poll_time_sec: 300 retries: 1 timeout_ms: 5000 user_tags: owning_team: dc_ops Copy The match_attributes attribute To support filtering of data that does not create value for your observability needs, you can set the global.match_attributes.{} and/or devices.<deviceName>.match_attributes.{} attribute map. This will provide filtering at the ktranslate level, before shipping data to New Relic, giving you granular control over monitoring of things like interfaces. The default behavior of this map is an OR condition, but you can override this and force an AND operator by prefixing your key name with !. This is also useful to return only matched items and omit all null and \"\" (empty) results. Default 'OR' with null and empty values Match when if_Alias begins with Uplink OR when if_interface_name begins with Gig, keep all null and \"\" values: devices: deviceName: ... match_attributes: if_Alias: \"^Uplink.*\" if_interface_name: \"^Gig.*\" Copy 'AND', omit null and empty values Match when if_Alias begins with Uplink AND when if_interface_name begins with Gig, drop all null and \"\" values: devices: deviceName: ... match_attributes: if_Alias: \"^Uplink.*\" \"!if_interface_name\": \"^Gig.*\" Copy Single match, omit null and empty values Match when if_Alias begins with Uplink, drop all null and \"\" values: devices: deviceName: ... match_attributes: \"!if_Alias\": \"^Uplink.*\" Copy The flow_only attribute To support monitoring of devices where performance statistics are nor accessible, available, or desired, you can set the devices.<deviceName>.flow_only attribute to true. This will generate a Flow Device entity in New Relic One which will only have telemetry in the KFlow event namespace. Alternatively, collecting flow telemetry from a device that is in your configuration file as an SNMP device will add decoration of the KFlow data to the pre-existing entity, such as a Router or Firewall. In New Relic One, you can see the results of this polling by investigating the following events: FROM KFlow SELECT count(*) FACET device_name WHERE instrumentation.name = 'netflow-events' TIMESERIES Copy The response_time and ping_only attributes To support monitoring of devices where performance statistics are not accessible or available, or in simple cases where basic round-trip time (RTT) monitoring is required, you can either set the global.response_time or devices.<deviceName>.ping_only attributes to true. This feature uses the go-ping package to send unprivileged UDP packets to devices in order to collect the average, min, and max RTT for the endpoint based on sending 1 packet/sec from ktranslate to the device IP address. Setting the global.response_time attribute to true will add RTT monitoring on top of existing SNMP polling. devices.<deviceName>.ping_only: true will allow you to monitor devices with only the UDP packets for RTT and no SNMP polling. In New Relic One, you can see the results of this polling by investigating the following metrics: FROM Metric SELECT average(kentik.ping.AvgRttMs) AS 'Average', max(kentik.ping.MaxRttMs) AS 'Max', min(kentik.ping.MinRttMs) AS 'Min' FACET device_name TIMESERIES Copy Tip You can use the ping_only attribute in replacement of the flow_only attribute if you would like to collect RTT metrics from a flow device. If both ping_only and flow_only are true, the device will be treated as a flow_only device. Flow data application mapping By default, flow telemetry is mapped to known applications based on evaluation of the layer 4 port in use on a specific flow conversation. If needed, you can override the default mapping by providing a YAML file during Docker runtime to the -application_map flag. This will allow you to specify application names based on ports you identify. Example syntax: applications: - ports: [9092, 9093] name: kafka - ports: [80, 8080] name: http - ports: [443, 8443] name: https Copy Flow data input filtering By default, flow data containers will collect and process every flow packet they receive. If needed, you can add an inclusion filter to the -nf.source flag that will ignore all traffic not matching the filter you provide. Syntax: --filters $TYPE,$FIELD,$FUNCTION,$MATCH Argument Name Required Description $TYPE ✓ The type of filter to apply. Possible values are string, int, and addr. $FIELD ✓ The name of the field to evaluate the match pattern against. $FUNCTION ✓ The type of function to use during evaluation. Possible values are Equal: ==, NotEqual: !=, LessThan: <, GreaterThan: >, Contains: % $MATCH ✓ The value to be used as a match pattern. Example Filters Only collect flow data from source addresses in the 10.0.0.0/24 CIDR range -nf.source sflow --filters addr,src_addr,%,10.10.0.0/24 Copy Only collect flow data where the destination port is not equal to 8531 -nf.source netflow5 --filters int,l4_dst_port,!=,8531 Copy You can also add multiple filters together with an inherited AND operator Only collect flow data from source addresses in the 10.0.0.0/24 CIDR range AND where the destination port is not equal to 8531 --filters addr,src_addr,%,10.0.0.0/24 --filters int,l4_dst_port,!=,8531 Copy",

      "body": "Profiles define what SNMP OIDs we want to collect and send to your New Relic account. This document explains how to modify an existing profile or create a new profile. Get started If you've decided to build a custom profile or modify one of our open source profiles, you need a few essential tools: A GitHub account: This enables you to raise issues and contribute changes to Kentik's open source profiles. An SNMP walk from a network device where you want to work on a profile. For more information, see our documentation on setting up SNMP and using snmpwalk. Permissions to perform Docker pull on the server that hosts your ktranslate container. This document covers: Making requests for new or modified profiles through GitHub to be worked on by the maintainers Contributing your own profiles and modifications publicly Using custom profiles privately Tip Support for all things relating to kentik/snmp-profiles is handled through GitHub issues. New Relic technical support is not able to provide any additional help beyond redirecting you back to raise an issue there. Make requests through GitHub This is the most common and simple scenario, for cases where you don't have the time or expertise with SNMP to do these yourself. After you provide the relevant data, our team will build the profile for you. Log into GitHub and go to the snmp-profiles repo. Click the Issues tab near the top. Click New issue. To request a new profile, look for the SNMP Profile Request section, and click Get started. Provide all requested information in the template, such as the device vendor, model, snmp object identifier, and a sanitized SNMP walk. For all other requests, use Open a blank issue. Tip Providing an SNMP walk is critical as we cannot do any work on the profile without these. This is not the same as an MIB file. The maintainers of the repo will review the information you provided and, if there is anything missing, they will follow up with you. Once all the necessary data is provided, they will add it to the queue of profiles to be built. After it is added to the repo, the issue will be closed, and all you have to do is update the ktranslate docker container on your end, and the newest profiles will automatically be loaded. Contribute profiles and modifications publicly We gladly accept contributions from anyone who wants to help out to either create new profiles or improve the existing profiles. To familiarize yourself with the structure of a profile, review this highly commented template.yml on GitHub. Log into GitHub and go to the snmp-profiles repo. To create a copy of the same information in your account, click the fork button near the top. Within your fork,make necessary changes to the files, or create new vendor directories and profiles as needed. Be sure to pass your profile through a YAML validator, such as codebeautify, before submitting a pull request. When you are done with your changes, submit a pull request to the upstream repo. The maintainers will review the change, and discuss any necessary feedback. When everyone is aligned, it will be merged. Shortly after a merge, new SNMP profiles are automatically available by pulling the new version of the Docker image and launching a new container in your environment. For more information, see our documentation about SNMP manual setup. Tip Be sure to sync your fork regularly to keep it up to date with changes in the upstream repo. What kinds of OIDs should I actually include in a profile? In many cases SNMP offers a lot of data, but much of that data does not provide actionable information. Or, the data provides value that is so uncommon and low impact, it might not be worth bringing into your New Relic account. You want to focus on collecting data that lets you know if there is anything that would stop the device from being able to perform whatever functions you expect it to perform. Building on from that, you should collect measurements that tell you how well it is performing those functions. Example 1: For a device operating as a VPN concentrator, we would collect high-level system metrics like: CPU and memory utilization Hardware sensor information to make sure that the device isn't going to shut itself down due to things like fan failures OIDs that tell us about the aggregated connections and throughput Example 2: An example of data that is available but provides very poor value is an OID table that lists all the running processes on a network appliance. Coming from a server admin perspective, that might sound useful, but since this is an appliance, you normally do not have the capability or the need to do anything with the processes that run inside it. Polling and storing tables with hundreds of items that you can't actually do anything with would not be efficient. Use custom profiles privately For cases where you want to make a change to a profile, but you know that it is a scenario that is very unique and would not apply to other customers you can locally edit the profiles. The way this is done is by using Docker's volume mount to pass in your customized files to the ktranslate container inside the etc/ktranslate/profiles/ directory. There are other ways you could accomplish this but in this example we will demonstrate using a git fork and clone. Ensure you are in the directory you want to keep the files in, then clone your fork of the GitHub repo to your Docker host: git clone https://github.com/<YourGitUser>/snmp-profiles.git Copy Get the command you would normally use to launch the SNMP container, and add a second volume mount argument after the one where we passed in the snmp-base.yaml. -v `pwd`/snmp-profiles/profiles:/etc/ktranslate/profiles \\ Copy The mount command replaces the built-in profiles directory with your customized data. The end result will be be similar to this: docker run -ti --name ktranslate-discovery --rm --net=host \\ --user `id -u`:`id -g` \\ -v `pwd`/snmp-base.yaml:/snmp-base.yaml \\ -v `pwd`/snmp-profiles/profiles:/etc/ktranslate/profiles \\ kentik/ktranslate:v2 \\ -snmp /snmp-base.yaml \\ -log_level info \\ -snmp_discovery=true Copy Tip Be sure to pass your custom version of the profiles in every time you launch a discovery container or SNMP polling container. If you don't use it consistently for all SNMP instances sets, this can cause unreliable behavior.",

      "body": "While running the ktranslate Docker container for New Relic network performance monitoring, you can monitor the health of the container to proactively detect potential issues. The ktranslate container image has the -tee_logs=true and -metrics=jchf settings available during runtime, which allow it to send health metrics into New Relic One directly. These are enabled by default when installing network performance monitoring via the New Relic One guided install. We recommend you to set them up when installing network performance monitoring manually. Logs from ktranslate Tip If you want to check the logs locally from the Docker host, run docker logs $CONTAINER_NAME. For example, docker logs ktranslate-snmp. The -tee_logs=true option sends logs to New Relic One when polling devices. To see them, do the following: Go to one.newrelic.com > Logs. In Find logs where, enter collector.name:\"ktranslate\" and click Query logs. Optional log parsing rule We recommend you to add a parsing rule to New Relic One logs to break the logs from ktranslate into fields that are easily searchable. This is especially helpful when you are running more than one container as it allows you to then search by the value of --service_name from the Docker container. Using the New Relic One logs UI, use the following patterns: Rule Name: ktranslate-health logs Query Attribute: \"plugin.type\" Query Value: \"ktranslate-health\" Parsing logic: %{NOTSPACE:time} ktranslate/%{NOTSPACE:container_service} \\[%{NOTSPACE:severity}\\] %{GREEDYDATA:message} Copy Alternatively, you can use New Relic's Nerdgraph API to manage your parsing rules. A sample of the logConfigurationsCreateParsingRule is below, you will need to replace $ACCOUNT_ID with the ID of your target account. mutation { logConfigurationsCreateParsingRule( accountId: $ACCOUNT_ID, rule: { description: \"ktranslate-health logs\", enabled: true, grok: \"%{NOTSPACE:time} ktranslate/%{NOTSPACE:container_service} \\\\[%{NOTSPACE:severity}\\\\] %{GREEDYDATA:message}\", lucene: \"\\\"plugin.type\\\":\\\"ktranslate-health\\\"\", nrql: \"SELECT * FROM Log WHERE `plugin.type` = 'ktranslate-health'\" } ) { errors { message type } rule { accountId id enabled description grok lucene nrql } } } Copy The result of this parsing rule is splitting a raw message from this: { \"collector.name\": \"ktranslate\", \"instrumentation.provider\": \"kentik\", \"message\": \"2021-12-08T14:59:56.007 ktranslate/snmp [Info] nrmFormat New Metadata for cisco-7513\", \"newrelic.source\": \"api.logs\", \"plugin.type\": \"ktranslate-health\", \"timestamp\": 1638975596000 } Copy To this, creating the searchable fields of container_service, severity, and time; as well as trimming the message field to more actionable data: { \"collector.name\": \"ktranslate\", \"container_service\": \"snmp\", \"instrumentation.provider\": \"kentik\", \"message\": \"nrmFormat New Metadata for cisco-7513\", \"newrelic.source\": \"api.logs\", \"plugin.type\": \"ktranslate-health\", \"severity\": \"Info\", \"time\": \"2021-12-08T15:29:56.026\", \"timestamp\": 1638977396000 } Copy Common log searches Below are some common searches that can be used during troubleshooting to gather data for support: What version of ktranslate am I running? Logs UI: bash Copy $ collector.name:\"ktranslate\" message:\"*KTranslate Running -- Version*\" NRQL: FROM Log SELECT * WHERE `collector.name` = 'ktranslate' AND `message` LIKE '%KTranslate Running -- Version%' Copy Expected Results: bash Copy $ KTranslate Running -- Version kt-2021-12-06-1546870234; Build Mon Dec 6 22:22:56 UTC 2021 What arguments were passed to Docker at runtime?

Without a parsing rule applied to your logs Logs UI: bash Copy $ collector.name:\"ktranslate\" message:-*\\[Info\\]* NRQL: FROM Log SELECT * WHERE `collector.name` = 'ktranslate' AND `message` NOT LIKE '%[Info]%' Copy With a parsing rule applied to your logs Logs UI: bash Copy $ collector.name:\"ktranslate\" severity:-\"Info\" NRQL: FROM Log SELECT * WHERE `collector.name` = 'ktranslate' AND `severity` != 'Info' Copy Expected Results: bash Copy $ KTranslate>cisco-7513 There was an SNMP polling error with the CustomDeviceMetrics walking OID .1.3.6.1.2.1.4.31.1.1.21 after 0 retries: request timeout (after 0 retries). Is my match_attributes filter working on my device? Logs UI: bash Copy $ collector.name:\"ktranslate\" message:\"*Match Attribute*\" NRQL: FROM Log SELECT * WHERE `collector.name` = 'ktranslate' AND `message` LIKE '%Match Attribute%' Copy Expected Results: bash Copy $ KTranslate>cisco-7513 Added 1 Match Attribute(s) All devices are expected to have at least 1 Match Attribute inherited from the default monitor_admin_shut: true configuration. You should expect a value of 2 to be shown for a device that you have added a single match attribute to. Tip You can further filter these results by adding the device name to your query: collector.name:\"ktranslate\" message:\"*$DEVICE_NAME*Match Attribute*\". Metrics from ktranslate The -metrics option captures the following performance metrics when polling devices: Metric Granularity Description baseserver_healthcheck_execution_total Top Level Rate of internal health checks. Shows mostly that things are not deadlocked and should always be greater than 0. inputq Top Level Messages per second (msg/sec) received over the last 60 seconds from all SNMP, Flow, and VPC inputs combined. jchfq Top Level Gauge rate with number of available pre-allocated buffers. It should be about 8,000. delivery_metrics_nr Delivery to New Relic One Batches per second (batches/sec) sent over the last 60 seconds for all metrics to New Relic One. delivery_logs_nr Delivery to New Relic One Logs per second (logs/sec) sent over the last 60 seconds for all logs to New Relic One. delivery_wins_nr Delivery to New Relic One Wins per second (wins/sec) of 200 HTTP codes received over the last 60 seconds from sending metrics and events to New Relic One. device_metrics SNMP Polls per second (polls/sec) of SNMP polling over the last 60 seconds for device level metrics. interface_metrics SNMP Polls per second (polls/sec) of SNMP polling over the last 60 seconds for interface level metrics. snmp_fail SNMP Gauge to monitor if SNMP polling is working faceted by device_name. Where 1 means good and 2 means fail. netflow.flows Netflow Flows per second (fps) received over the last 60 seconds for all device flow data: IPFIX, NetFlow, or sFlow. syslog_queue Syslog Gauge of syslog messages waiting to be processed. syslog_errors Syslog Errors per second (errors/sec) over the last 60 seconds while processing syslog messages. syslog_messages Syslog Messages per second (msg/sec) received over the last 60 seconds for all syslog data. Common metrics searches To see these metrics in New Relic One: Go to one.newrelic.com and click Query your data. Enter one of the following NRQL queries: What are the current versions of my ktranslate applications?

The possible values are AuthNoPriv, DES, AES, AES192, AES256, AES192C, or AES256C privacy_passphrase SNMPv3 privacy passphrase context_engine_id SNMPv3 context engine ID context_name SNMPv3 context name Tip You can use AWS Secrets Manager natively in your SNMP v3 config using the aws.sm.$SECRET_NAME syntax, replacing $SECRET_NAME as necessary to have ktranslate pull in your credentials during Docker runtime. Optional external config files To support a wide variety of configuration and automation needs, you can use external files that you volume mount into your Docker container to decouple certain elements of the standard configuration file. The syntax for these files is \"@fileName.extension\", including the double quotes. Discovery CIDRs Example: discovery: cidrs: \"@cidrs.yaml\" Copy The CIDRs file should use a YAML list syntax like this: - 10.10.0.0/24 - 10.20.0.0/24 - 192.168.0.21/32 Copy Devices Example: devices: - \"@neteng-devices.yaml\" - \"@dc-ops.yaml\" Copy The device files should use the same syntax as the standard devices section of the main config file, omitting the optional fields that are generated during discovery: devices: # Sample of SNMP v2c device ups_snmpv2c__10.10.0.201: device_name: ups_snmpv2c device_ip: 10.10.0.201 snmp_comm: public oid: .1.3.6.1.4.1.318.1.3.27 mib_profile: apc_ups.yml provider: kentik-ups poll_time_sec: 300 retries: 1 timeout_ms: 5000 user_tags: owning_team: dc_ops Copy The match_attributes attribute To support filtering of data that does not create value for your observability needs, you can set the global.match_attributes.{} and/or devices.<deviceName>.match_attributes.{} attribute map. This will provide filtering at the ktranslate level, before shipping data to New Relic, giving you granular control over monitoring of things like interfaces. The default behavior of this map is an OR condition, but you can override this and force an AND operator by prefixing your key name with !. This is also useful to return only matched items and omit all null and \"\" (empty) results. Default 'OR' with null and empty values Match when if_Alias begins with Uplink OR when if_interface_name begins with Gig, keep all null and \"\" values: devices: deviceName: ... match_attributes: if_Alias: \"^Uplink.*\" if_interface_name: \"^Gig.*\" Copy 'AND', omit null and empty values Match when if_Alias begins with Uplink AND when if_interface_name begins with Gig, drop all null and \"\" values: devices: deviceName: ... match_attributes: if_Alias: \"^Uplink.*\" \"!if_interface_name\": \"^Gig.*\" Copy Single match, omit null and empty values Match when if_Alias begins with Uplink, drop all null and \"\" values: devices: deviceName: ... match_attributes: \"!if_Alias\": \"^Uplink.*\" Copy The flow_only attribute To support monitoring of devices where performance statistics are nor accessible, available, or desired, you can set the devices.<deviceName>.flow_only attribute to true. This will generate a Flow Device entity in New Relic One which will only have telemetry in the KFlow event namespace. Alternatively, collecting flow telemetry from a device that is in your configuration file as an SNMP device will add decoration of the KFlow data to the pre-existing entity, such as a Router or Firewall. In New Relic One, you can see the results of this polling by investigating the following events: FROM KFlow SELECT count(*) FACET device_name WHERE instrumentation.name = 'netflow-events' TIMESERIES Copy The response_time and ping_only attributes To support monitoring of devices where performance statistics are not accessible or available, or in simple cases where basic round-trip time (RTT) monitoring is required, you can either set the global.response_time or devices.<deviceName>.ping_only attributes to true. This feature uses the go-ping package to send unprivileged UDP packets to devices in order to collect the average, min, and max RTT for the endpoint based on sending 1 packet/sec from ktranslate to the device IP address. Setting the global.response_time attribute to true will add RTT monitoring on top of existing SNMP polling. devices.<deviceName>.ping_only: true will allow you to monitor devices with only the UDP packets for RTT and no SNMP polling. In New Relic One, you can see the results of this polling by investigating the following metrics: FROM Metric SELECT average(kentik.ping.AvgRttMs) AS 'Average', max(kentik.ping.MaxRttMs) AS 'Max', min(kentik.ping.MinRttMs) AS 'Min' FACET device_name TIMESERIES Copy Tip You can use the ping_only attribute in replacement of the flow_only attribute if you would like to collect RTT metrics from a flow device. If both ping_only and flow_only are true, the device will be treated as a flow_only device. Flow data application mapping By default, flow telemetry is mapped to known applications based on evaluation of the layer 4 port in use on a specific flow conversation. If needed, you can override the default mapping by providing a YAML file during Docker runtime to the -application_map flag. This will allow you to specify application names based on ports you identify. Example syntax: applications: - ports: [9092, 9093] name: kafka - ports: [80, 8080] name: http - ports: [443, 8443] name: https Copy Flow data input filtering By default, flow data containers will collect and process every flow packet they receive. If needed, you can add an inclusion filter to the -nf.source flag that will ignore all traffic not matching the filter you provide. Syntax: --filters $TYPE,$FIELD,$FUNCTION,$MATCH Argument Name Required Description $TYPE ✓ The type of filter to apply. Possible values are string, int, and addr. $FIELD ✓ The name of the field to evaluate the match pattern against. $FUNCTION ✓ The type of function to use during evaluation. Possible values are Equal: ==, NotEqual: !=, LessThan: <, GreaterThan: >, Contains: % $MATCH ✓ The value to be used as a match pattern. Example Filters Only collect flow data from source addresses in the 10.0.0.0/24 CIDR range -nf.source sflow --filters addr,src_addr,%,10.10.0.0/24 Copy Only collect flow data where the destination port is not equal to 8531 -nf.source netflow5 --filters int,l4_dst_port,!=,8531 Copy You can also add multiple filters together with an inherited AND operator Only collect flow data from source addresses in the 10.0.0.0/24 CIDR range AND where the destination port is not equal to 8531 --filters addr,src_addr,%,10.0.0.0/24 --filters int,l4_dst_port,!=,8531 Copy",

      "body": "Profiles define what SNMP OIDs we want to collect and send to your New Relic account. This document explains how to modify an existing profile or create a new profile. Get started If you've decided to build a custom profile or modify one of our open source profiles, you need a few essential tools: A GitHub account: This enables you to raise issues and contribute changes to Kentik's open source profiles. An SNMP walk from a network device where you want to work on a profile. For more information, see our documentation on setting up SNMP and using snmpwalk. Permissions to perform Docker pull on the server that hosts your ktranslate container. This document covers: Making requests for new or modified profiles through GitHub to be worked on by the maintainers Contributing your own profiles and modifications publicly Using custom profiles privately Tip Support for all things relating to kentik/snmp-profiles is handled through GitHub issues. New Relic technical support is not able to provide any additional help beyond redirecting you back to raise an issue there. Make requests through GitHub This is the most common and simple scenario, for cases where you don't have the time or expertise with SNMP to do these yourself. After you provide the relevant data, our team will build the profile for you. Log into GitHub and go to the snmp-profiles repo. Click the Issues tab near the top. Click New issue. To request a new profile, look for the SNMP Profile Request section, and click Get started. Provide all requested information in the template, such as the device vendor, model, snmp object identifier, and a sanitized SNMP walk. For all other requests, use Open a blank issue. Tip Providing an SNMP walk is critical as we cannot do any work on the profile without these. This is not the same as an MIB file. The maintainers of the repo will review the information you provided and, if there is anything missing, they will follow up with you. Once all the necessary data is provided, they will add it to the queue of profiles to be built. After it is added to the repo, the issue will be closed, and all you have to do is update the ktranslate docker container on your end, and the newest profiles will automatically be loaded. Contribute profiles and modifications publicly We gladly accept contributions from anyone who wants to help out to either create new profiles or improve the existing profiles. To familiarize yourself with the structure of a profile, review this highly commented template.yml on GitHub. Log into GitHub and go to the snmp-profiles repo. To create a copy of the same information in your account, click the fork button near the top. Within your fork,make necessary changes to the files, or create new vendor directories and profiles as needed. Be sure to pass your profile through a YAML validator, such as codebeautify, before submitting a pull request. When you are done with your changes, submit a pull request to the upstream repo. The maintainers will review the change, and discuss any necessary feedback. When everyone is aligned, it will be merged. Shortly after a merge, new SNMP profiles are automatically available by pulling the new version of the Docker image and launching a new container in your environment. For more information, see our documentation about SNMP manual setup. Tip Be sure to sync your fork regularly to keep it up to date with changes in the upstream repo. What kinds of OIDs should I actually include in a profile? In many cases SNMP offers a lot of data, but much of that data does not provide actionable information. Or, the data provides value that is so uncommon and low impact, it might not be worth bringing into your New Relic account. You want to focus on collecting data that lets you know if there is anything that would stop the device from being able to perform whatever functions you expect it to perform. Building on from that, you should collect measurements that tell you how well it is performing those functions. Example 1: For a device operating as a VPN concentrator, we would collect high-level system metrics like: CPU and memory utilization Hardware sensor information to make sure that the device isn't going to shut itself down due to things like fan failures OIDs that tell us about the aggregated connections and throughput Example 2: An example of data that is available but provides very poor value is an OID table that lists all the running processes on a network appliance. Coming from a server admin perspective, that might sound useful, but since this is an appliance, you normally do not have the capability or the need to do anything with the processes that run inside it. Polling and storing tables with hundreds of items that you can't actually do anything with would not be efficient. Use custom profiles privately For cases where you want to make a change to a profile, but you know that it is a scenario that is very unique and would not apply to other customers you can locally edit the profiles. The way this is done is by using Docker's volume mount to pass in your customized files to the ktranslate container inside the etc/ktranslate/profiles/ directory. There are other ways you could accomplish this but in this example we will demonstrate using a git fork and clone. Ensure you are in the directory you want to keep the files in, then clone your fork of the GitHub repo to your Docker host: git clone https://github.com/<YourGitUser>/snmp-profiles.git Copy Get the command you would normally use to launch the SNMP container, and add a second volume mount argument after the one where we passed in the snmp-base.yaml. -v `pwd`/snmp-profiles/profiles:/etc/ktranslate/profiles \\ Copy The mount command replaces the built-in profiles directory with your customized data. The end result will be be similar to this: docker run -ti --name ktranslate-discovery --rm --net=host \\ --user `id -u`:`id -g` \\ -v `pwd`/snmp-base.yaml:/snmp-base.yaml \\ -v `pwd`/snmp-profiles/profiles:/etc/ktranslate/profiles \\ kentik/ktranslate:v2 \\ -snmp /snmp-base.yaml \\ -log_level info \\ -snmp_discovery=true Copy Tip Be sure to pass your custom version of the profiles in every time you launch a discovery container or SNMP polling container. If you don't use it consistently for all SNMP instances sets, this can cause unreliable behavior.",

      "body": "In the software industry, a tag typically refers to a piece of metadata added to a data set for the purpose of improving data organization and findability. At New Relic, our tags are key:value pairs (like team: operations) added to various sets of data, like monitored apps and hosts, agents, dashboards, and workloads. We make some important attributes available as tags (for example, app metadata like app name and language, and host metadata like host name and AWS region). You can also add your own custom tags. You can use tags in the UI to filter down to relevant data. Here is an example: Here you can see an accountId tag being used to filter workloads to a specific account. Tags help you to: Organize data coming from a large number of sources and/or to a large number of New Relic accounts. Identify teams, roles, environments, or regions to know who’s responsible for what (see example use cases). Better organize and search dashboards and workloads. Query and chart APM data. Tags are useful for organizing data at a high level. If you want to add more fine-grained detail, like capturing user names or other high-cardinality values, custom attributes or custom events are a better solution. Tip Tags were previously called labels in the New Relic UI. You may sometimes see labelin our code; for example, some of our APM agent config files use a label config option for tags. Tag format and limits Format requirements and limits for tags: The UI has limits on the total number of tags it can display per entity: Limit of 100 for tags reported by default or added via agent/integration configuration. Limit of 100 for custom tags added via UI or API. The following are maximum character length for tags: Key: 128 characters Value: 256 characters Allowed characters: Characters must be UTF-8. When using NerdGraph to add tags, a dash (-) in a tag key is interpreted as a minus symbol. If your tag key has a dash, use back ticks around it (like `key-name`). Best practices and tips Before adding tags, we recommend first seeing how our default tags work for you. When you're ready to add your own tags, review the following best practices tips to get the most out of them. Tips on keeping tags simple: Start by adding only tags you know you’ll definitely use. Unused tags create noise and may add confusion. Try to use short tags. Shorter tags are easier to parse, and also the UI may sometimes truncate longer tags. (See character limits.) When possible, use keys and values that are human-readable (for example, region: EMEA is better than Param8323 : 1229072). Avoid including several values like regions: EMEA | US | LATAM in a single tag. We recommend using three different tags for that, like region: emea, region: us, and region: latam. If you want to match multiple tags, you can do that using the advanced options in the filter UI. Tips on using tags consistently: Try to be consistent with tag language across your teams and entities. Be consistent with naming. For example, avoid using both region: emea and reg: emea. Be consistent with format. For example, avoid using both camelCase and kebab-case. Although tag searching is not case-sensitive in the UI and API, try to be consistent with capitalization. For example, avoid using both env: staging and env: Staging. Tips on cross-team implementation: Tags help improve observability and cost allocation. For this reason, responsibility for tag implementation is often assigned to an observability team, SREs, a group of architects, or a cross-team task force. We recommend the people responsible for implementing tags meet and create an internal policy to describe how the tags are defined and which conventions are to be used. Then: Keep this reference manual up to date. Automate the definition of tags when you deploy New Relic agents, at the cloud provider, or through New Relic automation tools, such as the API or Terraform. Create recurring reports that identify entities that are non-compliant with your tagging standards. Tag examples Here are some examples of common ways to use tags to organize data: Team-related tags Creating tags for team names can be helpful to understand which team, group, department, or region was responsible for a change that led to a performance issue. Team examples: team: backend team: frontend team: db Role examples: roles: architecture roles: devops roles: pm Region examples: region: emea region: america region: asia Environment-related tags You can create entities for the environment they belong to. Examples: env: production env: qa env: development env: staging Criticality-related tags You can create tags related to criticality levels, which lets you easier track the most critical issues. Examples: layer: level1 layer: level2 layer: level3 How tags are added Some important attributes, by default, are available for use as tags. For example, the account name, the account ID, and some basic host/server metadata are available as default tags. You can't remove these available-by-default tags. Here are some details about how tags are added for some specific data sources: Add tags via UI or API When you add tags via the UI or API, this occurs at the entity level. This means that, for example, if you have multiple APM agents monitoring a single entity and apply a tag via the UI, that tag is available for all data coming from that entity. To add or delete tags via the UI: Select a monitored entity, like a monitored app or host. Near the entity’s name at the top of the page, select the See metadata and manage tags menu. In the menu that pops up, add or delete a tag. For APM agents, restart your service. To manage tags via API: see our NerdGraph tagging docs. For a guide to using our CLI to automate tagging, see our developer site. APM agent tags You can add tags via the UI and API or you can add tags using APM agent configuration, both methods require you to restart your service. There are differences in how these apply tags: Via agent config: These tags are applied at the agent-level, not the entity/application level. This would be a good option if you have multiple agents monitoring different aspects of the same app (for example, a blue-green deployment model). Via the UI or API: These tags are applied at the entity/application level. Here are links to the agent configuration options: C SDK: not available Java Go .NET Node.js PHP Python Ruby For information on querying APM tags, see Query APM tags. And check out this short video on querying APM tags (3:20 minutes). Infrastructure data tags There are several ways tags are added to infrastructure entities and services: Use the UI or API to add tags at the entity level. Infrastructure agent: some attributes are available by default as tags. You can also add custom attributes, which are also available as tags in the UI. On-host integrations: some attributes are available by default as tags. You can also add tags by using integration-specific labels config options (for an example, see the labels config for the Apache integration). Cloud service integrations: by default we report tags and labels that are defined in the cloud service. To add tags, you'd add them on the cloud-service-side. Automate tags with our CLI For a guide to automating tags using our CLI tool, see our developer site. Use tags to filter the UI Use the filter field at the top of the New Relic Explorer to filter down to the entities you care about. You can use multiple filter conditions. To filter down to certain entities using tags: From one.newrelic.com, click Explorer. Click the Filter by... field to see a dropdown of available attributes and tags. You can filter by multiple elements and use advanced search options. To find an entity’s metadata and tags from the UI, here are two options: From a list of entities in the UI, at the far right, select an entity's icon. OR Select an entity. Near the top of the page, select the icon. To use the API to view tags, see our NerdGraph docs. Learn about how to use tags with dashboards and how to use tags with workloads. Custom queries, charts, and alerts Different features handle tags differently. Here are some details about how you can use NRQL to query tag data, or create NRQL condition alerts. Query and alert on APM tags You can query APM tags using NRQL. Minimum agent versions: C: not available Go: 2.3.0 Java: 4.9.0 .NET: 8.17 Node: v4.13.0 PHP: not available Python: v4.10.0.112 Ruby: 6.1.0.352 Here are some query examples: Throughput across shards Given a service that is distributed across nine shards, each shard assigned as an environment, we can plot the transaction throughput on all shards using a wildcard query like: SELECT rate(count(apm.service.transaction.duration), 1 minute) FROM Metric WHERE appName LIKE 'MyApp (%' AND transactionType = 'Other' FACET tags.Environment TIMESERIES Copy Transactions per team To see the number of transactions per service for a specific team, we might use a query like: FROM Transaction SELECT count(*) WHERE tags.Team = 'team-a' FACET tags.Project TIMESERIES Copy Alert on error rate for teams You can use a query for your services’ error rate for setting an alert without having to create a rule for each service. Here is the error rate for all services on a team called team-b. And this alert will automatically monitor any new app names added with the team tag. FROM Metric SELECT count(apm.service.error.count) / count(apm.service.transaction.duration) WHERE tags.Team = 'team-b' FACET appName Copy Related to this, you might create a general rule for a specific service deployed across several environments, so that we have an alarm for a single service monitoring each environment individually: From Metric SELECT count(apm.service.error.count) / count(apm.service.transaction.duration) WHERE tags.Project = 'MyProject' FACET tags.Environment Copy Query and alert on attributes As explained in the tag sources information, some important attributes are used as tags. You can query all attributes and create custom charts using NRQL, and create NRQL alert conditions.",

      "body": "There may be cases where an application sends many individual metrics that could be better managed in groups. Most of these occur with web transactions metrics named from URLs. For more information on this issue, see Metric grouping issues (MGIs). To reduce high cardinality and prevent metric grouping issues, New Relic supports rules for grouping or filtering out metrics (normalization). In some cases, when MGIs with a significant high number of metrics are detected, a rule is created automatically to protect the platform from performance degradation. Metric normalization rules management You can create and manage new rules that deal with the noise produced from high cardinality metrics by using the metric normalization tool, which is accessible from each service dashboard in the New Relic Explorer. Once there, select Metric Normalization in the left sidebar. There you can see the existing rules or create new ones. Click a rule to modify it, or click Create a new rule to create a new one. A new pane to configure the rule will be displayed. Available fields are: Match expression: enter the regular expression to group all the metrics you want to include in the rule. Matches: here you will see a preview of the metrics matched by the regular expression above. Action: the action you want to perform on the metrics. Replace: replace the matched metrics by the regular expression with the value described in the Replacement field. Ignore: ignore any metric that matches the regular expression. Deny new metrics: only write metrics that have already been reported, and ignore those that match the regular expression. Replacement: only active when Replace is enabled. Matched metrics are replaced with the field's value. If the regular expression is capturing groups, you can use placeholders for them with \\1 or \\2 for the groups 1 and 2 respectively. Active: rules can’t be deleted, but can be deactivated. Click the toggle to enable or disable the rule. If you want the rule to be removed, reach out to New Relic's support. Terminate: When enabled, the rules waterfall is exited when the associated pattern is matched. Notes: internal notes on the rule. Has no effect on the rule.

      "body": "NerdGraph is our GraphQL-format API that lets you query New Relic data and configure some New Relic features. After you sign up for a free New Relic account and install any of our monitoring services, you can get started with NerdGraph. What is NerdGraph? New Relic has several APIs. NerdGraph is the API we recommend for querying New Relic data and for performing some specific configurations (learn more about features). NerdGraph provides a single API interface for returning data from New Relic’s various APIs and microservices. Over time, other configuration capabilities will be added to NerdGraph. Important NerdGraph isn’t used for data ingest. For that, you'd use our data ingest APIs. NerdGraph is built using GraphQL, which is an open source API format that allows you to request exactly the data needed, with no over-fetching or under-fetching. For a lesson in how to use NerdGraph, watch this 7-minute video: Want to watch more video tutorials? Go to the New Relic University’s Intro to NerdGraph. Or see the online course on New Relic APIs. Use the GraphiQL explorer To get started using GraphQL, we recommend playing around with our GraphiQL explorer (GraphiQL is an open source graphical interface for using GraphQL). You can use it to explore our data schema, to read built-in object definitions, and to build and execute queries. To use GraphQL, you’ll need a user-specific New Relic API key called a user key. You can generate one or find an existing one from the GraphiQL explorer’s API key dropdown. To find the GraphiQL explorer: If your New Relic account uses an EU data center, go to api.eu.newrelic.com/graphiql. Otherwise use api.newrelic.com/graphiql. For tips on how to build queries, see Build queries. Requirements and endpoints To use NerdGraph, you need a New Relic user key, which can be generated and accessed from the GraphiQL explorer. The endpoints are: Main endpoint: https://api.newrelic.com/graphql Endpoint for accounts using EU data center: https://api.eu.newrelic.com/graphql To access the endpoint, use the following cURL command: curl -X POST https://api.newrelic.com/graphql \\ -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \\ -H 'API-Key: YOUR_NEW_RELIC_USER_KEY' \\ -d '{ \"query\": \"{ requestContext { userId apiKey } }\" } ' Copy What can you do with NerdGraph? NerdGraph functionality can be broken down into two main categories: Querying New Relic data. You can fetch data for a variety of purposes, including using it in a programmatic workflow, or building a New Relic One app for custom data visualizations. Configuring New Relic features. There are a variety of configurations available and more will be added over time. You can do things like add tags, configure workloads, or customize \"golden metrics.\" You can use NerdGraph to return a wide range of New Relic data but we’ve created some tutorials for common use cases: Topic Tutorials Your monitored entities Get data about entities Understand entity relationships and dependencies (used to build service maps) Query and configure \"golden metrics\" (important entity metrics) Querying data Query using NRQL (our query language) Tags Add and manage tags APM agents APM agent configuration Dashboards Create dashboards Export dashboards to other accounts Export dashboards as files Migrate from Insights Dashboard API to NerdGraph Alerts See all alert-related tutorials Applied Intelligence View and configure topology Workloads View and configure workloads Service Levels Configure and manage Service Levels Manage keys Create and manage keys (license keys used for data ingest, and user keys) Manage data Convert event data to metric data Drop data Distributed tracing Query distributed tracing data Configure Infinite Tracing New Relic One apps Build a New Relic One app Cloud integrations (AWS, Azure, GCP) Configure cloud integrations Partners and resellers Manage subscriptions (only for partners using original pricing model) Data partitions Manage data partitions Date retention Manage data retention NerdGraph terminology The following are terms that originate with GraphQL (the API format NerdGraph uses). Term Definition Queries and mutations There are two classes of GraphQL operations: Queries are basic requests used only to fetch data. These queries are not static, meaning that you can ask for more data or less data, depending on your needs. For each query, you can specify exactly what data you want to retrieve, as long as it is supported by the schema. Mutations are requests that perform an action, such as creating a resource or changing configuration. Mutations require the keyword mutation, as well as the name of the mutation. Type Data in GraphQL is organized into types. Types can be scalars (like strings, numbers, or booleans) or object types. An object type is a custom type made up of a collection of fields. For example, an object type called User may represent a user in a system. Field A field represents a piece of information on an object type that can be queried. Fields can be scalars, lists, or objects. For example, a User object type could have a string field called name. Interface An interface is an abstract type that represents a collection of common fields that other object types can implement. Tips on using the GraphiQL explorer You can make queries with the NerdGraph GraphiQL explorer. The explorer provides built-in schema definitions and features, including auto-complete and query validation. Query accounts a New Relic user can access You can query for the name of an account that an actor (a New Relic authorized user) has access to: query { actor { account(id: YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID) { name } } } Copy The response will mirror the query structure you defined in the request, making it easy to ask for the specific data that you want. { \"data\": { \"actor\": { \"account\": { \"name\": \"Data Nerd\" } } } } Copy Query user, account, and NRQL in one request The graph structure shows its capabilities when queries become more complex. For example, you can query for user information, account information, and make a NRQL query with one request. With REST API, this would take three different requests to three different endpoints. query { actor { account(id: YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID) { name nrql(query: \"SELECT * FROM Transaction\") { results } } user { name id } } } Copy",

      "body": "With NerdGraph, you can query details about your monitored entities. Important To work with an entity's golden metrics and tags, see the golden metrics API tutorial. Entity definition Entities are an important New Relic concept: we define an entity as anything we monitor. This includes (but is not limited to): Applications monitored by APM. Cloud integrations, services, and hosts monitored by our infrastructure monitoring. To view entity details in the UI, you can use the Explorer. When working with entities in NerdGraph, it's important to keep in mind that: A unique entity GUID identifies an entity. An entity exists over a span of time, even if it's a short period. An entity provides a useful entry point for exploring data about specific metrics and events, or for contextualizing data related to other entities. Requirements To use entities, you need a user key. Search for entities New Relic searches for entities by their attributes, primarily their name, but also by type of entity and other values. The search returns basic data about entities matching the search criteria. Then, from the basic query results, you can query a specific entity by its GUID. Besides domainType, other common entity attributes are: id accountId name domainId alertSeverity reporting You can filter by any of the above attributes. Additionally, you can use tags for filtering too. Caution You cannot filter by custom, root-level entity properties. Custom properties are only retrieved as part of the entity’s metadata in the actual search response. To filter by a custom field, transform it into an entity tag. You can craft a query in one of two ways: Use the queryBuilder argument to help you craft a query. Use the freeform query argument to build your own search. To use NerdGraph to query one or more entities, you can search by attribute or GUID. In addition to the examples below, we highly recommend exploring the API using the NerdGraph GraphiQL explorer, and benefiting from its inline documentation. Search with queryBuilder The queryBuilder argument is useful to construct simple queries. It allows you to add filters to your query from a predefined list of attributes, and their typical values. For more advanced queries, use the query argument instead. Go to the NerdGraph GraphiQL explorer. Run a basic query to find entities that match your search criteria. For example: { actor { entitySearch( queryBuilder : {domain: APM, type: APPLICATION}) { query results { entities { name entityType guid } } } } } Copy Search with freeform query This is useful to craft more complex queries. Go to the NerdGraph GraphiQL explorer. Run a basic query to find entities that match your search criteria. For example: query($query: String! ) { actor { entitySearch(query: $query) { count results { entities { name entityType guid } } } } } Copy Add the following variables to the Query variables section in NerdGraph: {\"query\": \"name LIKE 'nerd-graph' AND domainType IN ('APM-APPLICATION')\"} Copy Fetch entities by GUID When you know the GUID of the entity you want to fetch, you can just use the entity attribute: { actor { entity(guid: \"MTAwNDc5MzZ8QVBNfEFQUExJQ0FUSU9OfDExNzA0Mjk3\") { name entityType } } } Copy This can also be written as a search query: { actor { entitySearch(query: \"id = 'MTAwNDc5MzZ8QVBNfEFQUExJQ0FUSU9OfDExNzA0Mjk3'\") { query results { entities { name entityType } } } } } Copy Or, to fetch multiple entities at the same time, you can use the entities attribute: { actor { entities(guids: [\"MTAwNDc5MzZ8QVBNfEFQUExJQ0FUSU9OfDExNzA0Mjk3\", \"MTAwNDc5MzZ8QVBNfEFQUExJQ0FUSU9OfDExNzA0MTM3\"]) { name entityType } } } Copy Otherwise, use a search query: { actor { entitySearch(query: \"id in ('MTAwNDc5MzZ8QVBNfEFQUExJQ0FUSU9OfDExNzA0Mjk3', 'MTAwNDc5MzZ8QVBNfEFQUExJQ0FUSU9OfDExNzA0MTM3')\") { query results { entities { name entityType } } } } } Copy Example queries Queries are requests that are intended to only fetch data (and don't have any other effect). NerdGraph queries are not static, meaning that you can ask for more or less data depending on your needs. For each query, you can specify exactly what data you want to retrieve, as long as it's supported by the schema. Entities in NerdGraph rely on GraphQL interfaces, a concept that allows objects to share common fields. Interfaces are used to provide data for specific entity types, as you will see in many of these NerdGraph query examples. Get entity data using queryBuilder If you aren't sure how to start crafting an entity search query, use NerdGraph to help you build one. Next, retrieve entity data and the query string that was built. Request the query field in your results to see the query string built by the queryBuilder argument. You cannot use the query and queryBuilder arguments at the same time. We highly recommend exploring the API using the NerdGraph GraphiQL explorer, and using its inline documentation to see the query options available to you. { actor { entitySearch( queryBuilder : {domain: APM, type: APPLICATION}) { query results { entities { reporting ... on AlertableEntityOutline { alertSeverity } } } } } } Copy Get data for infrastructure integration entities in search results There are many different types of Infrastructure integration entities and they are listed separately from other entity types. Use the infrastructureIntegrationType input argument to explore them. You cannot use the query and queryBuilder arguments at the same time. Use infrastructureIntegrationType in place of the type input argument. We highly recommend exploring the API using the NerdGraph GraphiQL explorer and using its inline documentation to see the query options available to you. { actor { entitySearch(queryBuilder: { infrastructureIntegrationType : F5_NODE}) { query results { entities { entityType domain } } } } } Copy Get alert information on alertable entities in search results Fetch the alert severity of any entity that can be monitored by New Relic's alerts. This NerdGraph query will tell you if we are currently receiving data from your application (using the reporting field). If the entity is an alertable type, results will include the alert severity of the entity. If the results include entities that are not alertable, they will not include the AlertableEntityOutline fields. { actor { entitySearch(query: \"name like 'nerdgraph' and alertSeverity is not null\") { results { entities { reporting ... on AlertableEntityOutline { alertSeverity } } } } } } Copy Get summary data on APM entities in search results Different entity types have specific data associated with them. The following NerdGraph query example shows a selection of fields available for APM application entities: More summary data can be requested in your query. If entities of other types are returned in your search results, they will not include these fields. { actor { entitySearch(query: \"name like 'nerdgraph' and domainType = 'APM-APPLICATION'\") { results { entities { name ... on ApmApplicationEntityOutline { apmSummary { errorRate apdexScore webResponseTimeAverage responseTimeAverage } } } } } } } Copy Get data specific to each entity type in search results Different entity types have specific data associated with them. This NerdGraph query example requests the name for all entities regardless of which entity type they are, as well as the error rate for APM, browser monitoring, and mobile entities. If entities of other types are returned in your search results, they will not include an error rate field. { actor { entitySearch(query: \"name like 'nerdgraph'\") { results { entities { name ... on ApmApplicationEntityOutline { apmSummary { errorRate } } ... on BrowserApplicationEntityOutline { browserSummary { jsErrorRate } } ... on MobileApplicationEntityOutline { mobileSummary { httpErrorRate } } } } } } } Copy Get all tags for each entity in search results This NerdGraph query example fetches tags for every entity returned in the search results. For more information, see the NerdGraph GraphiQL tagging tutorial. { actor { entitySearch(query: \"name like 'nerdgraph'\") { results { entities { name tags { key values } } } } } } Copy Use tags to filter entity results This NerdGraph query example filters entities that belong to the INFRA domain and belong to awsRegion us-east-1, and returns their name in the search results. { actor { entitySearch(query: \"domain = 'INFRA' and tags.aws.awsRegion = 'us-east-1'\") { results { entities { name } } } } } Copy Additionally, filtering can be done by whether a given tag is present. The following query filters entities of the domainType BROWSER-APPLICATION and have the tag clusterAgentId defined. { actor { entitySearch(query: \"domainType = 'BROWSER-APPLICATION' and tags.clusterAgentId is not null\") { results { entities { name } } } } } Copy For more information, see the NerdGraph GraphiQL tagging tutorial. Aggregate results by an attribute or a tag This NerdGraph query example filters entities of domainType APM-APPLICATION domain that belong to awsRegion us-east-1, and returns their name in the search results. Then aggregates results to get the total number of entities grouped by New Relic account id. { actor { entitySearch(query: \"domainType = 'APM-APPLICATION'\") { facetedCounts(facets: {facetCriterion: {facet: ACCOUNT_ID}}) { counts { count facet } } } } } Copy Additionally, aggregation can be done by tags too; the following query filters entities of domainType APM-APPLICATION domain that belong to awsRegion us-east-1, then aggregates results to get the total number of entities grouped by Agent language. { actor { entitySearch(query: \"domainType = 'APM-APPLICATION' and tags.aws.awsRegion = 'us-east-1'\") { facetedCounts(facets: {facetCriterion: {tag: \"language\"}}) { counts { count facet } } } } } Copy For more information, see the NerdGraph GraphiQL tagging tutorial. Get the nextCursor for paginated search results The NerdGraph GraphiQL explorer paginates results from an entity search. If your search criteria yields more than the API limit and you want to view the rest of the results, you can request nextCursor in your initial request, and use its value in another query to retrieve the following \"page\" of results. If there are no more results, nextCursor will be null. { actor { entitySearch(query: \"name like 'nerd-graph'\") { results { nextCursor entities { name } } } } } Copy Use the value of nextCursor in your next search: { actor { entitySearch(query: \"name like 'nerd-graph'\") { results(cursor: \"next_cursor_value\") { nextCursor entities { name } } } } } Copy Delete entities You can manually delete any entity in your account by using the NerdGraph API. To do so, run this query with the entity's GUID in the NerdGraph GraphiQL explorer: mutation { entityDelete(guids: [\"EntityGuid\"]) { deletedEntities failures } } Copy Important Currently, you can only remove the following entity types using the Nerdgraph API: APM-APPLICATION, EXT-SERVICE, and REF-REPOSITORY. You may see a deleted entity in your UI if a New Relic agent reindexes it again.",

      "body": "In the software industry, a tag typically refers to a piece of metadata added to a data set for the purpose of improving data organization and findability. At New Relic, our tags are key:value pairs (like team: operations) added to various sets of data, like monitored apps and hosts, agents, dashboards, and workloads. We make some important attributes available as tags (for example, app metadata like app name and language, and host metadata like host name and AWS region). You can also add your own custom tags. You can use tags in the UI to filter down to relevant data. Here is an example: Here you can see an accountId tag being used to filter workloads to a specific account. Tags help you to: Organize data coming from a large number of sources and/or to a large number of New Relic accounts. Identify teams, roles, environments, or regions to know who’s responsible for what (see example use cases). Better organize and search dashboards and workloads. Query and chart APM data. Tags are useful for organizing data at a high level. If you want to add more fine-grained detail, like capturing user names or other high-cardinality values, custom attributes or custom events are a better solution. Tip Tags were previously called labels in the New Relic UI. You may sometimes see labelin our code; for example, some of our APM agent config files use a label config option for tags. Tag format and limits Format requirements and limits for tags: The UI has limits on the total number of tags it can display per entity: Limit of 100 for tags reported by default or added via agent/integration configuration. Limit of 100 for custom tags added via UI or API. The following are maximum character length for tags: Key: 128 characters Value: 256 characters Allowed characters: Characters must be UTF-8. When using NerdGraph to add tags, a dash (-) in a tag key is interpreted as a minus symbol. If your tag key has a dash, use back ticks around it (like `key-name`). Best practices and tips Before adding tags, we recommend first seeing how our default tags work for you. When you're ready to add your own tags, review the following best practices tips to get the most out of them. Tips on keeping tags simple: Start by adding only tags you know you’ll definitely use. Unused tags create noise and may add confusion. Try to use short tags. Shorter tags are easier to parse, and also the UI may sometimes truncate longer tags. (See character limits.) When possible, use keys and values that are human-readable (for example, region: EMEA is better than Param8323 : 1229072). Avoid including several values like regions: EMEA | US | LATAM in a single tag. We recommend using three different tags for that, like region: emea, region: us, and region: latam. If you want to match multiple tags, you can do that using the advanced options in the filter UI. Tips on using tags consistently: Try to be consistent with tag language across your teams and entities. Be consistent with naming. For example, avoid using both region: emea and reg: emea. Be consistent with format. For example, avoid using both camelCase and kebab-case. Although tag searching is not case-sensitive in the UI and API, try to be consistent with capitalization. For example, avoid using both env: staging and env: Staging. Tips on cross-team implementation: Tags help improve observability and cost allocation. For this reason, responsibility for tag implementation is often assigned to an observability team, SREs, a group of architects, or a cross-team task force. We recommend the people responsible for implementing tags meet and create an internal policy to describe how the tags are defined and which conventions are to be used. Then: Keep this reference manual up to date. Automate the definition of tags when you deploy New Relic agents, at the cloud provider, or through New Relic automation tools, such as the API or Terraform. Create recurring reports that identify entities that are non-compliant with your tagging standards. Tag examples Here are some examples of common ways to use tags to organize data: Team-related tags Creating tags for team names can be helpful to understand which team, group, department, or region was responsible for a change that led to a performance issue. Team examples: team: backend team: frontend team: db Role examples: roles: architecture roles: devops roles: pm Region examples: region: emea region: america region: asia Environment-related tags You can create entities for the environment they belong to. Examples: env: production env: qa env: development env: staging Criticality-related tags You can create tags related to criticality levels, which lets you easier track the most critical issues. Examples: layer: level1 layer: level2 layer: level3 How tags are added Some important attributes, by default, are available for use as tags. For example, the account name, the account ID, and some basic host/server metadata are available as default tags. You can't remove these available-by-default tags. Here are some details about how tags are added for some specific data sources: Add tags via UI or API When you add tags via the UI or API, this occurs at the entity level. This means that, for example, if you have multiple APM agents monitoring a single entity and apply a tag via the UI, that tag is available for all data coming from that entity. To add or delete tags via the UI: Select a monitored entity, like a monitored app or host. Near the entity’s name at the top of the page, select the See metadata and manage tags menu. In the menu that pops up, add or delete a tag. For APM agents, restart your service. To manage tags via API: see our NerdGraph tagging docs. For a guide to using our CLI to automate tagging, see our developer site. APM agent tags You can add tags via the UI and API or you can add tags using APM agent configuration, both methods require you to restart your service. There are differences in how these apply tags: Via agent config: These tags are applied at the agent-level, not the entity/application level. This would be a good option if you have multiple agents monitoring different aspects of the same app (for example, a blue-green deployment model). Via the UI or API: These tags are applied at the entity/application level. Here are links to the agent configuration options: C SDK: not available Java Go .NET Node.js PHP Python Ruby For information on querying APM tags, see Query APM tags. And check out this short video on querying APM tags (3:20 minutes). Infrastructure data tags There are several ways tags are added to infrastructure entities and services: Use the UI or API to add tags at the entity level. Infrastructure agent: some attributes are available by default as tags. You can also add custom attributes, which are also available as tags in the UI. On-host integrations: some attributes are available by default as tags. You can also add tags by using integration-specific labels config options (for an example, see the labels config for the Apache integration). Cloud service integrations: by default we report tags and labels that are defined in the cloud service. To add tags, you'd add them on the cloud-service-side. Automate tags with our CLI For a guide to automating tags using our CLI tool, see our developer site. Use tags to filter the UI Use the filter field at the top of the New Relic Explorer to filter down to the entities you care about. You can use multiple filter conditions. To filter down to certain entities using tags: From one.newrelic.com, click Explorer. Click the Filter by... field to see a dropdown of available attributes and tags. You can filter by multiple elements and use advanced search options. To find an entity’s metadata and tags from the UI, here are two options: From a list of entities in the UI, at the far right, select an entity's icon. OR Select an entity. Near the top of the page, select the icon. To use the API to view tags, see our NerdGraph docs. Learn about how to use tags with dashboards and how to use tags with workloads. Custom queries, charts, and alerts Different features handle tags differently. Here are some details about how you can use NRQL to query tag data, or create NRQL condition alerts. Query and alert on APM tags You can query APM tags using NRQL. Minimum agent versions: C: not available Go: 2.3.0 Java: 4.9.0 .NET: 8.17 Node: v4.13.0 PHP: not available Python: v4.10.0.112 Ruby: 6.1.0.352 Here are some query examples: Throughput across shards Given a service that is distributed across nine shards, each shard assigned as an environment, we can plot the transaction throughput on all shards using a wildcard query like: SELECT rate(count(apm.service.transaction.duration), 1 minute) FROM Metric WHERE appName LIKE 'MyApp (%' AND transactionType = 'Other' FACET tags.Environment TIMESERIES Copy Transactions per team To see the number of transactions per service for a specific team, we might use a query like: FROM Transaction SELECT count(*) WHERE tags.Team = 'team-a' FACET tags.Project TIMESERIES Copy Alert on error rate for teams You can use a query for your services’ error rate for setting an alert without having to create a rule for each service. Here is the error rate for all services on a team called team-b. And this alert will automatically monitor any new app names added with the team tag. FROM Metric SELECT count(apm.service.error.count) / count(apm.service.transaction.duration) WHERE tags.Team = 'team-b' FACET appName Copy Related to this, you might create a general rule for a specific service deployed across several environments, so that we have an alarm for a single service monitoring each environment individually: From Metric SELECT count(apm.service.error.count) / count(apm.service.transaction.duration) WHERE tags.Project = 'MyProject' FACET tags.Environment Copy Query and alert on attributes As explained in the tag sources information, some important attributes are used as tags. You can query all attributes and create custom charts using NRQL, and create NRQL alert conditions.",

Tags are useful for organizing data at a high level. If you want to add more fine-grained detail, like capturing user names or other high-cardinality values, custom attributes or custom events are a better solution. Tip Tags were previously called labels in the New Relic UI. You may sometimes see labelin our code; for example, some of our APM agent config files use a label config option for tags. Tag format and limits Format requirements and limits for tags: The UI has limits on the total number of tags it can display per entity: Limit of 100 for tags reported by default or added via agent/integration configuration. Limit of 100 for custom tags added via UI or API. The following are maximum character length for tags: Key: 128 characters Value: 256 characters Allowed characters: Characters must be UTF-8. When using NerdGraph to add tags, a dash (-) in a tag key is interpreted as a minus symbol. If your tag key has a dash, use back ticks around it (like `key-name`). Best practices and tips Before adding tags, we recommend first seeing how our default tags work for you. When you're ready to add your own tags, review the following best practices tips to get the most out of them. Tips on keeping tags simple: Start by adding only tags you know you’ll definitely use. Unused tags create noise and may add confusion. Try to use short tags. Shorter tags are easier to parse, and also the UI may sometimes truncate longer tags. (See character limits.) When possible, use keys and values that are human-readable (for example, region: EMEA is better than Param8323 : 1229072). Avoid including several values like regions: EMEA | US | LATAM in a single tag. We recommend using three different tags for that, like region: emea, region: us, and region: latam. If you want to match multiple tags, you can do that using the advanced options in the filter UI. Tips on using tags consistently: Try to be consistent with tag language across your teams and entities. Be consistent with naming. For example, avoid using both region: emea and reg: emea. Be consistent with format. For example, avoid using both camelCase and kebab-case. Although tag searching is not case-sensitive in the UI and API, try to be consistent with capitalization. For example, avoid using both env: staging and env: Staging. Tips on cross-team implementation: Tags help improve observability and cost allocation. For this reason, responsibility for tag implementation is often assigned to an observability team, SREs, a group of architects, or a cross-team task force. We recommend the people responsible for implementing tags meet and create an internal policy to describe how the tags are defined and which conventions are to be used. Then: Keep this reference manual up to date. Automate the definition of tags when you deploy New Relic agents, at the cloud provider, or through New Relic automation tools, such as the API or Terraform. Create recurring reports that identify entities that are non-compliant with your tagging standards. Tag examples Here are some examples of common ways to use tags to organize data: Team-related tags Creating tags for team names can be helpful to understand which team, group, department, or region was responsible for a change that led to a performance issue. Team examples: team: backend team: frontend team: db Role examples: roles: architecture roles: devops roles: pm Region examples: region: emea region: america region: asia Environment-related tags You can create entities for the environment they belong to. Examples: env: production env: qa env: development env: staging Criticality-related tags You can create tags related to criticality levels, which lets you easier track the most critical issues. Examples: layer: level1 layer: level2 layer: level3 How tags are added Some important attributes, by default, are available for use as tags. For example, the account name, the account ID, and some basic host/server metadata are available as default tags. You can't remove these available-by-default tags. Here are some details about how tags are added for some specific data sources: Add tags via UI or API When you add tags via the UI or API, this occurs at the entity level. This means that, for example, if you have multiple APM agents monitoring a single entity and apply a tag via the UI, that tag is available for all data coming from that entity. To add or delete tags via the UI: Select a monitored entity, like a monitored app or host. Near the entity’s name at the top of the page, select the See metadata and manage tags menu. In the menu that pops up, add or delete a tag. For APM agents, restart your service. To manage tags via API: see our NerdGraph tagging docs. For a guide to using our CLI to automate tagging, see our developer site. APM agent tags You can add tags via the UI and API or you can add tags using APM agent configuration, both methods require you to restart your service. There are differences in how these apply tags: Via agent config: These tags are applied at the agent-level, not the entity/application level. This would be a good option if you have multiple agents monitoring different aspects of the same app (for example, a blue-green deployment model). Via the UI or API: These tags are applied at the entity/application level. Here are links to the agent configuration options: C SDK: not available Java Go .NET Node.js PHP Python Ruby For information on querying APM tags, see Query APM tags. And check out this short video on querying APM tags (3:20 minutes). Infrastructure data tags There are several ways tags are added to infrastructure entities and services: Use the UI or API to add tags at the entity level. Infrastructure agent: some attributes are available by default as tags. You can also add custom attributes, which are also available as tags in the UI. On-host integrations: some attributes are available by default as tags. You can also add tags by using integration-specific labels config options (for an example, see the labels config for the Apache integration). Cloud service integrations: by default we report tags and labels that are defined in the cloud service. To add tags, you'd add them on the cloud-service-side. Automate tags with our CLI For a guide to automating tags using our CLI tool, see our developer site. Use tags to filter the UI Use the filter field at the top of the New Relic Explorer to filter down to the entities you care about. You can use multiple filter conditions. To filter down to certain entities using tags: From one.newrelic.com, click Explorer. Click the Filter by... field to see a dropdown of available attributes and tags. You can filter by multiple elements and use advanced search options. To find an entity’s metadata and tags from the UI, here are two options: From a list of entities in the UI, at the far right, select an entity's icon. OR Select an entity. Near the top of the page, select the icon. To use the API to view tags, see our NerdGraph docs. Learn about how to use tags with dashboards and how to use tags with workloads. Custom queries, charts, and alerts Different features handle tags differently. Here are some details about how you can use NRQL to query tag data, or create NRQL condition alerts. Query and alert on APM tags You can query APM tags using NRQL. Minimum agent versions: C: not available Go: 2.3.0 Java: 4.9.0 .NET: 8.17 Node: v4.13.0 PHP: not available Python: v4.10.0.112 Ruby: 6.1.0.352 Here are some query examples: Throughput across shards Given a service that is distributed across nine shards, each shard assigned as an environment, we can plot the transaction throughput on all shards using a wildcard query like: SELECT rate(count(apm.service.transaction.duration), 1 minute) FROM Metric WHERE appName LIKE 'MyApp (%' AND transactionType = 'Other' FACET tags.Environment TIMESERIES Copy Transactions per team To see the number of transactions per service for a specific team, we might use a query like: FROM Transaction SELECT count(*) WHERE tags.Team = 'team-a' FACET tags.Project TIMESERIES Copy Alert on error rate for teams You can use a query for your services’ error rate for setting an alert without having to create a rule for each service. Here is the error rate for all services on a team called team-b. And this alert will automatically monitor any new app names added with the team tag. FROM Metric SELECT count(apm.service.error.count) / count(apm.service.transaction.duration) WHERE tags.Team = 'team-b' FACET appName Copy Related to this, you might create a general rule for a specific service deployed across several environments, so that we have an alarm for a single service monitoring each environment individually: From Metric SELECT count(apm.service.error.count) / count(apm.service.transaction.duration) WHERE tags.Project = 'MyProject' FACET tags.Environment Copy Query and alert on attributes As explained in the tag sources information, some important attributes are used as tags. You can query all attributes and create custom charts using NRQL, and create NRQL alert conditions.",

      "body": "New Relic monitoring is built around the concept of entities. In this doc, you'll learn how we define entities, what you can do with them, and how you can create your own entities or groupings of entities. What's an entity? From a New Relic perspective, entity is purposefully a broad concept. An entity is anything that a) reports data to New Relic or that contains data that we have access to, and b) is something we've identified with a unique entity ID. For most entities, the ID is indicated by the attribute entityGuid. An entity can be any fundamental data-reporting component, like an application, a host, or a database service, but it can also refer to larger groupings of those components. For example, to monitor a data center, you could aggregate those hosts in New Relic to be a workload (a custom grouping of entities). That workload is, itself, also an entity. Also very important is the relationships between entities. Our behind-the-scenes relationship-mapping helps us understand how entities are connected, how they affect each other. And this allows us to give you the power to configure how any data you're bringing in is related to existing entities, or how it's related to other entities. Our focus on entities and their relationships is important because our goal is to give you practical information about your business-important entities, and not give you an unhelpfully huge stream of data from a huge list of monitored things. With more insight at the entity level, you can better monitor and troubleshoot complex, modern systems. Find and explore entities and entity data Tip You can create new entity types for monitoring any data source. Learn more about entity synthesis. Some tips for finding and understanding entity data: To find an entity's entityGuid and entityName and other metadata: from any list of monitored entities in the New Relic Explorer, click an entity's icon, and click See metadata and tags. For most entities, its GUID is reported as the attribute entityGuid. For workloads, it's workloadGuid. You can run NRQL queries to find entities by their GUID. To see connections between entities, you have several options: When viewing an entity in the UI, use the Related entities UI. Service maps. Distributed tracing. Our NerdGraph API. To group entities together, see Group entities. Customize entity definitions and relationships. To learn technical details about entity types, see our GitHub repo. In an entity type's definition file, you'll see information like: The domain: for example, APM, or Infra. Its type: for example, Application or AWSECSCONTAINERINSTANCE. Default tags. The entityExpirationTime: how long data from that entity lasts in the UI, which is different from database data retention. Group and organize entities You can place entities into groups that reflect business-important relationships in your organization. For example, you might group all entities related to a specific team or department, or related to a specific service. Or you might group multiple hosts together to reflect their grouping in a data center. To group your entities, see: Tag entities. Create workloads, which allow you to group business-important sets of entities. Create entities and customize entity data Customize entity data with entity synthesis If you have telemetry from any source that's not supported by New Relic out of the box, you can propose a mapping for it. Once approved, any telemetry received by New Relic that matches your definition file will be synthesized into an entity. To learn more: For reserved attributes and how entity relationships are defined, keep reading this doc. For how to do the work of modifying existing entity types or creating new ones, see our GitHub repo on entity synthesis. Reserved attributes for synthesized entities These attributes are meant to be synthesized from the telemetry we receive. Do not set them unless you're aware of the implications and consequences. Attribute Description entity.guid Generally, you should not set this attribute field on your telemetry data. New Relic may add this field to ingested data to store a unique identifier for the entity associated with the data point. If telemetry arrives with the entity.guid attribute already present, then New Relic will not change the value. However, it may cause undefined behavior such as missing entities in the UI, or telemetry not associating with the expected entities. One use case for passing this attribute is to associate ingested telemetry with an entity already created by New Relic. When the entity.guid attribute is sent, the value will override New Relic’s entity identification system (such as entity synthesis definitions) and instead will use the attribute as the data. entity.name This attribute shouldn't be put on ingested telemetry data unless you're trying to override the entity name that would have been selected by New Relic’s entity identification system. While New Relic won't change the value if it's already present on the data, New Relic may add the attribute to your data. Therefore invalid or unexpected values may cause undefined behavior such as missing entities in the UI, or telemetry not associating with the expected entities. If this field is present on ingested telemetry, its value will be used to name the entity associated with the data point. This name will be used instead of the name selected by New Relic’s entity identification system (for example, entity synthesis definitions). Note that many entities use the name as part of their identification, so changing this field may result in the generation of a new entity. entity.type This attribute shouldn't be put on ingested telemetry data except for certain legacy cases where it's required to distinguish entity types. Passing this field may interfere with entity detection, particularly if unrecognized values are sent in this field. While New Relic won't change the value if already present on the data, the field is not guaranteed to provide unambiguous filtering of telemetry at query-time. Existing entity definitions already have overlapping values, and we recommend avoiding entity.type in favor of other fields for filtering telemetry queries. This field is used by New Relic, meaning that invalid or unexpected values may cause undefined behavior such as missing entities in the UI, or telemetry not associating with the expected entities. To learn how to do the work of modifying existing entity types or creating new ones, see our GitHub repo on entity synthesis. Entity relationships Connections between entities are automatically created by New Relic based on what we can infer from your telemetry. For example, when two services that communicate using HTTP are instrumented with New Relic, we infer a \"calls/called-by\" relationship between them. When viewing a specific entity in either the New Relic Explorer, Navigator, or Lookout, you can see its Related entities in the entity's mini overview. This gives a visualization of the various entities connected directly to the current entity. You can quickly view important metrics for these related entities and navigate from one entity to another, through all the connected parts of your stack. Tip Learn more about how entities are related with our NerdGraph API. When relationships are not automatically detected, you can manually create them using the \"Add/edit related entities\" link in Related entities. Important Currently, you can only manually create calls/called-by relationships between service entities. Tip To manage manual relationships, you need to have modify and delete capabilities on entity relationships. If you don’t see the edit relationships button, contact your account admin. Which relationships are created? These are the relationships created between entities: Source: New Relic agent Relationship source Relationship type Relationship target Why is the relationship created? Application instrumented with a New Relic agent CALLS Application instrumented with a New Relic agent Relationships between applications monitored by New Relic agents are reported using the DurationByCaller metric. The callee reports the metric. For example, the metric DurationByCaller/Mobile/100/1234/HTTP/all indicates that the caller is APPLICATION 1234 for account 100. Application instrumented with a New Relic agent CALLS Service instrumented with a New Relic agent An application (caller) that calls a service (callee) monitored by New Relic creates a relationship that's reported by the caller using the ExternalApp metric. For example, the metric ExternalApp/dirac.vips.net/100#1234/all indicates that the callee is APPLICATION 1234 for account 100. The metric is reported if the callee successfully responds to the caller. Service instrumented with a New Relic agent CALLS Service instrumented with a New Relic agent When a New Relic agent detects that a service (caller) calls another service (callee) instrumented by New Relic, the callee reports the metric ClientApplication. For example, the metric ClientApplication/100#1234/all indicates that the caller is APPLICATION 1234 for account 100. Service instrumented with a New Relic agent CALLS A datastore instance When an application calls a datastore instance it creates a relationship reported with the DatastoreInstance metric. For example, the metric Datastore/instance/MySQL/172.16.16.3/3306 indicates the datastore instance is vendor: MySQL, host: 172.16.16.3, port: 3306. This metric also supports the legacy datastore instance format Datastore/instance/MySQL/172.16.16.3:3306. Currently we cannot determine whether the datastore instance is instrumented by New Relic and has an entity associated to it. APM agent SERVES Browser agent This relationship is created when an APM agent injects the browser agent into a page. Workload entity CONTAINS Any entity When a workload is created or updated, relationships for each of the entities that belong to the workload are created. Because some workloads are “dynamic” (defined by tags), relationships are re-created every 5 minutes. This way entities can join or leave the workload. Source: Infrastructure Relationship source Relationship type Relationship target Why is the relationship created? Infrastructure host HOSTS Application This relationship is created when an application is running in one or more hosts, and the infra agent is running in those hosts. Infrastructure host HOSTS Container This relationship is created when containers are running in one or more hosts, and the host is instrumented with the infra agent. Source: Synthetics monitor Relationship source Relationship type Relationship target Why is the relationship created? Synthetics Monitor CALLS Browser agent This relationship is created when a synthetics monitor checks a page instrumented with the browser agent. Synthetics Monitor CALLS APM application Agent events that contain the attribute nr.syntheticsMonitorId have been described as synthetics monitors (the source) interacting with an APM application (the target). If the header exists and the APM application Id exists, a relationship is created between the monitor and the app. Source: Kubernetes Relationship source Relationship type Relationship target Why is the relationship created? Cluster CONTAINS Pod This relationship is created when a pod is created in a cluster instrumented with the New Relic Kubernetes integration. Cluster CONTAINS Deployment This relationship is created when a deployment is created in a cluster instrumented with the New Relic Kubernetes integration. Cluster CONTAINS DaemonSet This relationship is created when a DaemonSet is created in a cluster instrumented with the New Relic Kubernetes integration. Cluster CONTAINS StatefulSet This relationship is created when a StatefulSet is created in a cluster instrumented with the New Relic Kubernetes integration. Cluster CONTAINS Host This relationship is created when a host that's part of a cluster is instrumented with the New Relic Kubernetes integration. Deployment CONTAINS Pod This relationship is created when a deployment creates a pod in a cluster instrumented with the New Relic Kubernetes integration. DaemonSet CONTAINS Pod This relationship is created when a DaemonSet is created a pod in a cluster instrumented with the New Relic Kubernetes integration. StatefulSet CONTAINS Pod This relationship is created when a StatefulSet creates a pod in a cluster instrumented with the New Relic Kubernetes integration. Pod CONTAINS Container This relationship is created when a pod creates a container in a cluster instrumented with the New Relic Kubernetes integration. Host HOSTS Pod This relationship is created when a pod is running in a host that's part of a cluster instrumented with the New Relic Kubernetes integration. Container HOSTS Application This relationship is created when an application is running in docker, and the hosts where docker is running are instrumented by the the infra agent. External services Relationship source Relationship type Relationship target Why is the relationship created? External service CALLS External service When the relationship is created, the external service reports a span with its name on the service.name attribute and the name of the service that initiates the call in the parent.service.name attribute. Application IS External service A relationship between an application and an external service is created so that users can navigate between them using the related entities component. Browser application instrumented with a New Relic agent CALLS External service A browser application reports an Ajax/HostTransaction metric when calling an external service (URL). Example metric: Ajax/HostTransaction/api.segment.io:443/CallbackTime' Cluster CONTAINS External service When the relationship is created, the external service reports a span with the attribute k8s.cluster.name, the name of the cluster. The cluster must be instrumented with the New Relic Kubernetes integration and the cluster name set for the integration must match the one reported in the span. Pod HOSTS External service When the relationship is created, the external service reports a span with the following attributes: service.name: The name of the service. k8s.cluster.name: The name of the cluster. k8s.pod.name: The name of the pod that’s running the service. k8s.namespace.name: The namespace where the pod was created. The cluster must be instrumented with the New Relic Kubernetes integration and the cluster name set for the integration must match the one reported in the span. Create relationships manually You can create additional relationships using NerdGraph, our GraphQL API. Relationships can be created or replaced using the mutation entityRelationshipUserDefinedCreateOrReplace. As its name suggests, it allows you to create a relationship between two entities with a given type. If the relationship already exists between the two entities, it will be added again with the updated given values: the creation time and the creator user id: mutation { entityRelationshipUserDefinedCreateOrReplace( sourceEntityGuid: \"{SourceEntityGuid}\" targetEntityGuid: \"{TargetEntityGuid}\" type: BUILT_FROM ) { errors { message type } } } Copy Delete relationships using the mutation entityRelationshipUserDefinedDelete. source and target are mandatory, whereas type isn't. If the mutation its executed without any type, all the relationships between the two entities will be removed. mutation { entityRelationshipUserDefinedDelete( sourceEntityGuid: \"{SourceEntityGuid}\" targetEntityGuid: \"{TargetEntityGuid}\" type: BUILT_FROM ) { errors { message type } } } Copy Find information about fetching relationships in the relationships API tutorial. Some considerations Two entities can have multiple relationships, one for each relationship type. Two entities can hold a relationship IF they belong to the same trusted account. For each entity, you can manually define up to 2000 relationships. When the limit is reached, the API will return a LIMIT_EXCEEDED error. Each mutation can fail if you don't have access to one of the two entities (source/target). Relationship types provide additional information about how two entities are related. The supported relationship types are: Relationship types Type Description CALLS The relationship between one service or application calling another. Used to display upstream and downstream services. CONTAINS The relationship and hierarchical use cases common to modern and cloud infrastructure. For example, this could indicate that the HOST contains a container. HOSTS The relationship between an application or process and the system it runs on. SERVES The relationship between a back-end application and the browser application it returns in the response. is The relationship between an entity captured as a separate entity by another telemetry data source and the one you're currently viewing. CONNECTS_TO The source entity has a connection to the target entity. BUILT_FROM The target entity contains the code for the source entity.",

Circle visualization and table view Each application (or other facet) is represented by a circle. The size of the circles indicate the magnitude of the signal for that application and the color indicates whether the value has significantly decreased or increased in the last five minutes, based on the standard deviation of the prior hour (default evaluation and comparison time windows.) Please note that the type of signal is important when interpreting your results. When you first look at the legend below, you might be tempted to interpret yellow as good and dark purple as bad, but that is not always the case. Here are some examples: In the APM/services golden signals, a dark yellow circle in Throughput might signify that something bad has occurred and led to a drop in traffic. At the same time, a dark purple circle might also be concerning due to unexpected load. Both are significant findings worth exploring. In browser golden signals, a dark purple circle in Page Views might be great, as you are seeing more traffic to your site! With errors golden signals (in all entity types), a large circle, even if gray (not deviating from normal volume), is worth exploring because a high count of errors in your system is important to investigate. The legend allows you to change the colors used to highlight deviating services To change the color palette, click the gear icon by the low-high color legend. This allows you to change the colors used to highlight deviating services. To get a table view of the same data, click the toggle on the right. You can also hover over each color to filter the view by degree lower or higher deviance. Abnormal golden signals On the right, New Relic Lookout displays the most significantly deviating applications (or other facet) in a side panel, weighted by both the magnitude of the performance indicators and the scale of their deviations. Details include the name of the key performance indicator, their magnitude during the recent time window, and the difference between the averages from one time compared to the other. Instant search Click the magnifying glass icon in the side panel to open a search box. Typing into the search box filters the circles, table, and abnormal signals to applications (or other facets) that contain the text. This is a good way to quickly zoom to various subsystems. New Relic Lookout doesn't rerun the analysis when using the instant search. Change view Click the Change View button on the right side panel. The panel that appears shows you all the entity-specific golden signals you can toggle between out of the box. By choosing the Browser Golden Signal or other views, you can change from the default view. Each new view will have the golden signals appropriate for that entity type. Drill down into the details To analyze an application or facet, click a circle, table row, or abnormal golden signal. The details panel shows the degree of deviation of the performance indicator, a link to the affected entity, and recent alert and deployment activity for that entity, when available. There’s also an indication of whether the selected evaluation time period would be abnormal or not in reference to other comparison time windows, such as the same time yesterday or the same time last week. This allows you to quickly see if the abnormal behavior is odd in general, or just based on the comparison time window. Performance tab The default tab shows charts for other key performance indicators for the selected application or facet. The charts compare the two time windows being analyzed. You can click their titles to rerun the analysis, focusing on the selected key performance indicator. When the target is a New Relic One application, we show the top transactions, error classes, external services, and database operations, alongside links to the relevant New Relic One features. Abnormal History tab This section analyzes past performance of the selected signal and calls out any time periods with notable abnormalities. Each card represents an abnormal time window and can be clicked for more details. The charts will display any relevant violations and deployments in New Relic. Correlations tab New Relic Lookout can find other signals that began behaving differently around the same time as the selected signal for that entity type. Clicking the name of the signal reruns the analysis, focusing on that key performance indicator. The chart titles link to New Relic One when there’s an associated entity in your account. Note that correlations currently do not analyze across accounts. The correlated signals displayed are for others in the account of the original application you are viewing. This helps focus the data on correlations that are more likely related to your issue. Profile tab Based on the same technology as New Relic’s error profiles, this tab compares the last five minutes to the prior hour by default (or whatever time windows you’ve selected with query editing) and surfaces any attributes that have significantly different distributions in the events being targeted by the selected signal. For example, if a custom attribute indicated that a recent throughput spike came from one user, that would surface highly in Profiles if most of the traffic usually comes from many users. Traces tab If the entity has distributed traces configured and available in the selected evaluated time window, the Traces section is enabled. Each card shows a summary of a trace and can be clicked for details. The Explore all traces links to the distributed traces application, filtered to the selected entity. Create a custom view To target signals and time windows beyond the default values, click the Change view button and select Custom view. To create your own view: Select the account or subaccount. Select the data type (metrics or events). Different functionality is available depending on the type. In View a chart with, select the metric or event you are interested in. Default is golden signals (throughput, response time, and errors). You can also build custom queries (filters) to target a signal that isn't on the list. In Facet by, select what the circles represent. Default is appName, but you can also choose host or any other facetable attribute available for the signal you’ve selected. If you plan to save/favorite this new view, provide a name in the Name your view box. Keep in mind that you can edit this view at any time using the pencil icon. The default time windows analyzed by New Relic Lookout are the last five minutes compared to the hour before. Use the time controls (View data from and Compare data to) to target other time windows. one.newrelic.com > Apps > New Relic Lookout: All event and metric data in the New Relic database can be queried using the Edit query feature. Click Analyze to begin analyzing the signal you’ve selected. You can also create your own query: Create your query. This query is comparing data from the past thirty minutes to data from the same range a day ago. Change from Basic to Advanced after clicking the Custom view button. Select the data type (metrics or events). Different functionality is available depending on the type. Enter your query using NRQL. Please note that not all NRQL features are available in the Lookout Advanced query feature. By default, the system will run this query using the last five minutes of data compared to the previous hour. Some examples of the syntax for changing the comparison and evaluation time windows are below. Click Analyze to begin analyzing the signal you’ve selected. Query: Compare the last 15 minutes to the same time 1 day ago Please note that the UNTIL NOW portion is required here unlike in standard NRQL. Without the UNTIL NOW added, the system will query a 5 minute slice of data starting 15 minutes ago SINCE 15 minutes AGO UNTIL NOW COMPARE WITH 1 day ago Copy Query: Compare a specific time range to the same range a month ago SINCE '2021-03-07 07:00:00-0500' UNTIL '2021-03-08 07:00:00-0500' COMPARE WITH 1 month ago Copy Or: SINCE 'today at midnight' UNTIL 'now' COMPARE WITH 1 MONTH AGO Copy Example: Unusual increases in error count The default view of New Relic Lookout shows application status across your estate, comparing the last five minutes to the hour before. Under regular operation, most large systems may have a handful of abnormalities, but usually most things will indicate normal behavior. Suddenly, several circles begin to change to red under the Errors section. This indicates that several applications are experiencing unusual increases in error count. It may be that one or two circles for important systems are red, and perhaps much larger than they usually appear. Clicking one of these can provide more information on what is happening. You might see that the error rate is substantially elevated, even thousands of percent higher than normal. To troubleshoot this issue, here's what you might discover in the New Relic Lookout tabs: Performance would show you data about other signals, illuminating the characteristics of the change in system dynamics. Correlations would surface other applications that are affected and how, as well as opportunities to pivot to other applications that may be closer to the underlying causes. Traces, in turn, would show distributed traces, which can provide specific examples of traffic running through those systems. Abnormal history would show other times in the past week with elevated errors, showing whether or not this problem happens regularly, such as every day at the same time or whenever there is a deployment. Profiles might show that all or most of the new errors share common properties, such as all being isolated to just one region/account/user. Combining the information from these sections, not only can you get a sense of what is going on, but also where to focus actions to resolve the problem.",

      "body": "In the software industry, a tag typically refers to a piece of metadata added to a data set for the purpose of improving data organization and findability. At New Relic, our tags are key:value pairs (like team: operations) added to various sets of data, like monitored apps and hosts, agents, dashboards, and workloads. We make some important attributes available as tags (for example, app metadata like app name and language, and host metadata like host name and AWS region). You can also add your own custom tags. You can use tags in the UI to filter down to relevant data. Here is an example: Here you can see an accountId tag being used to filter workloads to a specific account. Tags help you to: Organize data coming from a large number of sources and/or to a large number of New Relic accounts. Identify teams, roles, environments, or regions to know who’s responsible for what (see example use cases). Better organize and search dashboards and workloads. Query and chart APM data. Tags are useful for organizing data at a high level. If you want to add more fine-grained detail, like capturing user names or other high-cardinality values, custom attributes or custom events are a better solution. Tip Tags were previously called labels in the New Relic UI. You may sometimes see labelin our code; for example, some of our APM agent config files use a label config option for tags. Tag format and limits Format requirements and limits for tags: The UI has limits on the total number of tags it can display per entity: Limit of 100 for tags reported by default or added via agent/integration configuration. Limit of 100 for custom tags added via UI or API. The following are maximum character length for tags: Key: 128 characters Value: 256 characters Allowed characters: Characters must be UTF-8. When using NerdGraph to add tags, a dash (-) in a tag key is interpreted as a minus symbol. If your tag key has a dash, use back ticks around it (like `key-name`). Best practices and tips Before adding tags, we recommend first seeing how our default tags work for you. When you're ready to add your own tags, review the following best practices tips to get the most out of them. Tips on keeping tags simple: Start by adding only tags you know you’ll definitely use. Unused tags create noise and may add confusion. Try to use short tags. Shorter tags are easier to parse, and also the UI may sometimes truncate longer tags. (See character limits.) When possible, use keys and values that are human-readable (for example, region: EMEA is better than Param8323 : 1229072). Avoid including several values like regions: EMEA | US | LATAM in a single tag. We recommend using three different tags for that, like region: emea, region: us, and region: latam. If you want to match multiple tags, you can do that using the advanced options in the filter UI. Tips on using tags consistently: Try to be consistent with tag language across your teams and entities. Be consistent with naming. For example, avoid using both region: emea and reg: emea. Be consistent with format. For example, avoid using both camelCase and kebab-case. Although tag searching is not case-sensitive in the UI and API, try to be consistent with capitalization. For example, avoid using both env: staging and env: Staging. Tips on cross-team implementation: Tags help improve observability and cost allocation. For this reason, responsibility for tag implementation is often assigned to an observability team, SREs, a group of architects, or a cross-team task force. We recommend the people responsible for implementing tags meet and create an internal policy to describe how the tags are defined and which conventions are to be used. Then: Keep this reference manual up to date. Automate the definition of tags when you deploy New Relic agents, at the cloud provider, or through New Relic automation tools, such as the API or Terraform. Create recurring reports that identify entities that are non-compliant with your tagging standards. Tag examples Here are some examples of common ways to use tags to organize data: Team-related tags Creating tags for team names can be helpful to understand which team, group, department, or region was responsible for a change that led to a performance issue. Team examples: team: backend team: frontend team: db Role examples: roles: architecture roles: devops roles: pm Region examples: region: emea region: america region: asia Environment-related tags You can create entities for the environment they belong to. Examples: env: production env: qa env: development env: staging Criticality-related tags You can create tags related to criticality levels, which lets you easier track the most critical issues. Examples: layer: level1 layer: level2 layer: level3 How tags are added Some important attributes, by default, are available for use as tags. For example, the account name, the account ID, and some basic host/server metadata are available as default tags. You can't remove these available-by-default tags. Here are some details about how tags are added for some specific data sources: Add tags via UI or API When you add tags via the UI or API, this occurs at the entity level. This means that, for example, if you have multiple APM agents monitoring a single entity and apply a tag via the UI, that tag is available for all data coming from that entity. To add or delete tags via the UI: Select a monitored entity, like a monitored app or host. Near the entity’s name at the top of the page, select the See metadata and manage tags menu. In the menu that pops up, add or delete a tag. For APM agents, restart your service. To manage tags via API: see our NerdGraph tagging docs. For a guide to using our CLI to automate tagging, see our developer site. APM agent tags You can add tags via the UI and API or you can add tags using APM agent configuration, both methods require you to restart your service. There are differences in how these apply tags: Via agent config: These tags are applied at the agent-level, not the entity/application level. This would be a good option if you have multiple agents monitoring different aspects of the same app (for example, a blue-green deployment model). Via the UI or API: These tags are applied at the entity/application level. Here are links to the agent configuration options: C SDK: not available Java Go .NET Node.js PHP Python Ruby For information on querying APM tags, see Query APM tags. And check out this short video on querying APM tags (3:20 minutes). Infrastructure data tags There are several ways tags are added to infrastructure entities and services: Use the UI or API to add tags at the entity level. Infrastructure agent: some attributes are available by default as tags. You can also add custom attributes, which are also available as tags in the UI. On-host integrations: some attributes are available by default as tags. You can also add tags by using integration-specific labels config options (for an example, see the labels config for the Apache integration). Cloud service integrations: by default we report tags and labels that are defined in the cloud service. To add tags, you'd add them on the cloud-service-side. Automate tags with our CLI For a guide to automating tags using our CLI tool, see our developer site. Use tags to filter the UI Use the filter field at the top of the New Relic Explorer to filter down to the entities you care about. You can use multiple filter conditions. To filter down to certain entities using tags: From one.newrelic.com, click Explorer. Click the Filter by... field to see a dropdown of available attributes and tags. You can filter by multiple elements and use advanced search options. To find an entity’s metadata and tags from the UI, here are two options: From a list of entities in the UI, at the far right, select an entity's icon. OR Select an entity. Near the top of the page, select the icon. To use the API to view tags, see our NerdGraph docs. Learn about how to use tags with dashboards and how to use tags with workloads. Custom queries, charts, and alerts Different features handle tags differently. Here are some details about how you can use NRQL to query tag data, or create NRQL condition alerts. Query and alert on APM tags You can query APM tags using NRQL. Minimum agent versions: C: not available Go: 2.3.0 Java: 4.9.0 .NET: 8.17 Node: v4.13.0 PHP: not available Python: v4.10.0.112 Ruby: 6.1.0.352 Here are some query examples: Throughput across shards Given a service that is distributed across nine shards, each shard assigned as an environment, we can plot the transaction throughput on all shards using a wildcard query like: SELECT rate(count(apm.service.transaction.duration), 1 minute) FROM Metric WHERE appName LIKE 'MyApp (%' AND transactionType = 'Other' FACET tags.Environment TIMESERIES Copy Transactions per team To see the number of transactions per service for a specific team, we might use a query like: FROM Transaction SELECT count(*) WHERE tags.Team = 'team-a' FACET tags.Project TIMESERIES Copy Alert on error rate for teams You can use a query for your services’ error rate for setting an alert without having to create a rule for each service. Here is the error rate for all services on a team called team-b. And this alert will automatically monitor any new app names added with the team tag. FROM Metric SELECT count(apm.service.error.count) / count(apm.service.transaction.duration) WHERE tags.Team = 'team-b' FACET appName Copy Related to this, you might create a general rule for a specific service deployed across several environments, so that we have an alarm for a single service monitoring each environment individually: From Metric SELECT count(apm.service.error.count) / count(apm.service.transaction.duration) WHERE tags.Project = 'MyProject' FACET tags.Environment Copy Query and alert on attributes As explained in the tag sources information, some important attributes are used as tags. You can query all attributes and create custom charts using NRQL, and create NRQL alert conditions.",

      "body": "New Relic monitoring is built around the concept of entities. In this doc, you'll learn how we define entities, what you can do with them, and how you can create your own entities or groupings of entities. What's an entity? From a New Relic perspective, entity is purposefully a broad concept. An entity is anything that a) reports data to New Relic or that contains data that we have access to, and b) is something we've identified with a unique entity ID. For most entities, the ID is indicated by the attribute entityGuid. An entity can be any fundamental data-reporting component, like an application, a host, or a database service, but it can also refer to larger groupings of those components. For example, to monitor a data center, you could aggregate those hosts in New Relic to be a workload (a custom grouping of entities). That workload is, itself, also an entity. Also very important is the relationships between entities. Our behind-the-scenes relationship-mapping helps us understand how entities are connected, how they affect each other. And this allows us to give you the power to configure how any data you're bringing in is related to existing entities, or how it's related to other entities. Our focus on entities and their relationships is important because our goal is to give you practical information about your business-important entities, and not give you an unhelpfully huge stream of data from a huge list of monitored things. With more insight at the entity level, you can better monitor and troubleshoot complex, modern systems. Find and explore entities and entity data Tip You can create new entity types for monitoring any data source. Learn more about entity synthesis. Some tips for finding and understanding entity data: To find an entity's entityGuid and entityName and other metadata: from any list of monitored entities in the New Relic Explorer, click an entity's icon, and click See metadata and tags. For most entities, its GUID is reported as the attribute entityGuid. For workloads, it's workloadGuid. You can run NRQL queries to find entities by their GUID. To see connections between entities, you have several options: When viewing an entity in the UI, use the Related entities UI. Service maps. Distributed tracing. Our NerdGraph API. To group entities together, see Group entities. Customize entity definitions and relationships. To learn technical details about entity types, see our GitHub repo. In an entity type's definition file, you'll see information like: The domain: for example, APM, or Infra. Its type: for example, Application or AWSECSCONTAINERINSTANCE. Default tags. The entityExpirationTime: how long data from that entity lasts in the UI, which is different from database data retention. Group and organize entities You can place entities into groups that reflect business-important relationships in your organization. For example, you might group all entities related to a specific team or department, or related to a specific service. Or you might group multiple hosts together to reflect their grouping in a data center. To group your entities, see: Tag entities. Create workloads, which allow you to group business-important sets of entities. Create entities and customize entity data Customize entity data with entity synthesis If you have telemetry from any source that's not supported by New Relic out of the box, you can propose a mapping for it. Once approved, any telemetry received by New Relic that matches your definition file will be synthesized into an entity. To learn more: For reserved attributes and how entity relationships are defined, keep reading this doc. For how to do the work of modifying existing entity types or creating new ones, see our GitHub repo on entity synthesis. Reserved attributes for synthesized entities These attributes are meant to be synthesized from the telemetry we receive. Do not set them unless you're aware of the implications and consequences. Attribute Description entity.guid Generally, you should not set this attribute field on your telemetry data. New Relic may add this field to ingested data to store a unique identifier for the entity associated with the data point. If telemetry arrives with the entity.guid attribute already present, then New Relic will not change the value. However, it may cause undefined behavior such as missing entities in the UI, or telemetry not associating with the expected entities. One use case for passing this attribute is to associate ingested telemetry with an entity already created by New Relic. When the entity.guid attribute is sent, the value will override New Relic’s entity identification system (such as entity synthesis definitions) and instead will use the attribute as the data. entity.name This attribute shouldn't be put on ingested telemetry data unless you're trying to override the entity name that would have been selected by New Relic’s entity identification system. While New Relic won't change the value if it's already present on the data, New Relic may add the attribute to your data. Therefore invalid or unexpected values may cause undefined behavior such as missing entities in the UI, or telemetry not associating with the expected entities. If this field is present on ingested telemetry, its value will be used to name the entity associated with the data point. This name will be used instead of the name selected by New Relic’s entity identification system (for example, entity synthesis definitions). Note that many entities use the name as part of their identification, so changing this field may result in the generation of a new entity. entity.type This attribute shouldn't be put on ingested telemetry data except for certain legacy cases where it's required to distinguish entity types. Passing this field may interfere with entity detection, particularly if unrecognized values are sent in this field. While New Relic won't change the value if already present on the data, the field is not guaranteed to provide unambiguous filtering of telemetry at query-time. Existing entity definitions already have overlapping values, and we recommend avoiding entity.type in favor of other fields for filtering telemetry queries. This field is used by New Relic, meaning that invalid or unexpected values may cause undefined behavior such as missing entities in the UI, or telemetry not associating with the expected entities. To learn how to do the work of modifying existing entity types or creating new ones, see our GitHub repo on entity synthesis. Entity relationships Connections between entities are automatically created by New Relic based on what we can infer from your telemetry. For example, when two services that communicate using HTTP are instrumented with New Relic, we infer a \"calls/called-by\" relationship between them. When viewing a specific entity in either the New Relic Explorer, Navigator, or Lookout, you can see its Related entities in the entity's mini overview. This gives a visualization of the various entities connected directly to the current entity. You can quickly view important metrics for these related entities and navigate from one entity to another, through all the connected parts of your stack. Tip Learn more about how entities are related with our NerdGraph API. When relationships are not automatically detected, you can manually create them using the \"Add/edit related entities\" link in Related entities. Important Currently, you can only manually create calls/called-by relationships between service entities. Tip To manage manual relationships, you need to have modify and delete capabilities on entity relationships. If you don’t see the edit relationships button, contact your account admin. Which relationships are created? These are the relationships created between entities: Source: New Relic agent Relationship source Relationship type Relationship target Why is the relationship created? Application instrumented with a New Relic agent CALLS Application instrumented with a New Relic agent Relationships between applications monitored by New Relic agents are reported using the DurationByCaller metric. The callee reports the metric. For example, the metric DurationByCaller/Mobile/100/1234/HTTP/all indicates that the caller is APPLICATION 1234 for account 100. Application instrumented with a New Relic agent CALLS Service instrumented with a New Relic agent An application (caller) that calls a service (callee) monitored by New Relic creates a relationship that's reported by the caller using the ExternalApp metric. For example, the metric ExternalApp/dirac.vips.net/100#1234/all indicates that the callee is APPLICATION 1234 for account 100. The metric is reported if the callee successfully responds to the caller. Service instrumented with a New Relic agent CALLS Service instrumented with a New Relic agent When a New Relic agent detects that a service (caller) calls another service (callee) instrumented by New Relic, the callee reports the metric ClientApplication. For example, the metric ClientApplication/100#1234/all indicates that the caller is APPLICATION 1234 for account 100. Service instrumented with a New Relic agent CALLS A datastore instance When an application calls a datastore instance it creates a relationship reported with the DatastoreInstance metric. For example, the metric Datastore/instance/MySQL/172.16.16.3/3306 indicates the datastore instance is vendor: MySQL, host: 172.16.16.3, port: 3306. This metric also supports the legacy datastore instance format Datastore/instance/MySQL/172.16.16.3:3306. Currently we cannot determine whether the datastore instance is instrumented by New Relic and has an entity associated to it. APM agent SERVES Browser agent This relationship is created when an APM agent injects the browser agent into a page. Workload entity CONTAINS Any entity When a workload is created or updated, relationships for each of the entities that belong to the workload are created. Because some workloads are “dynamic” (defined by tags), relationships are re-created every 5 minutes. This way entities can join or leave the workload. Source: Infrastructure Relationship source Relationship type Relationship target Why is the relationship created? Infrastructure host HOSTS Application This relationship is created when an application is running in one or more hosts, and the infra agent is running in those hosts. Infrastructure host HOSTS Container This relationship is created when containers are running in one or more hosts, and the host is instrumented with the infra agent. Source: Synthetics monitor Relationship source Relationship type Relationship target Why is the relationship created? Synthetics Monitor CALLS Browser agent This relationship is created when a synthetics monitor checks a page instrumented with the browser agent. Synthetics Monitor CALLS APM application Agent events that contain the attribute nr.syntheticsMonitorId have been described as synthetics monitors (the source) interacting with an APM application (the target). If the header exists and the APM application Id exists, a relationship is created between the monitor and the app. Source: Kubernetes Relationship source Relationship type Relationship target Why is the relationship created? Cluster CONTAINS Pod This relationship is created when a pod is created in a cluster instrumented with the New Relic Kubernetes integration. Cluster CONTAINS Deployment This relationship is created when a deployment is created in a cluster instrumented with the New Relic Kubernetes integration. Cluster CONTAINS DaemonSet This relationship is created when a DaemonSet is created in a cluster instrumented with the New Relic Kubernetes integration. Cluster CONTAINS StatefulSet This relationship is created when a StatefulSet is created in a cluster instrumented with the New Relic Kubernetes integration. Cluster CONTAINS Host This relationship is created when a host that's part of a cluster is instrumented with the New Relic Kubernetes integration. Deployment CONTAINS Pod This relationship is created when a deployment creates a pod in a cluster instrumented with the New Relic Kubernetes integration. DaemonSet CONTAINS Pod This relationship is created when a DaemonSet is created a pod in a cluster instrumented with the New Relic Kubernetes integration. StatefulSet CONTAINS Pod This relationship is created when a StatefulSet creates a pod in a cluster instrumented with the New Relic Kubernetes integration. Pod CONTAINS Container This relationship is created when a pod creates a container in a cluster instrumented with the New Relic Kubernetes integration. Host HOSTS Pod This relationship is created when a pod is running in a host that's part of a cluster instrumented with the New Relic Kubernetes integration. Container HOSTS Application This relationship is created when an application is running in docker, and the hosts where docker is running are instrumented by the the infra agent. External services Relationship source Relationship type Relationship target Why is the relationship created? External service CALLS External service When the relationship is created, the external service reports a span with its name on the service.name attribute and the name of the service that initiates the call in the parent.service.name attribute. Application IS External service A relationship between an application and an external service is created so that users can navigate between them using the related entities component. Browser application instrumented with a New Relic agent CALLS External service A browser application reports an Ajax/HostTransaction metric when calling an external service (URL). Example metric: Ajax/HostTransaction/api.segment.io:443/CallbackTime' Cluster CONTAINS External service When the relationship is created, the external service reports a span with the attribute k8s.cluster.name, the name of the cluster. The cluster must be instrumented with the New Relic Kubernetes integration and the cluster name set for the integration must match the one reported in the span. Pod HOSTS External service When the relationship is created, the external service reports a span with the following attributes: service.name: The name of the service. k8s.cluster.name: The name of the cluster. k8s.pod.name: The name of the pod that’s running the service. k8s.namespace.name: The namespace where the pod was created. The cluster must be instrumented with the New Relic Kubernetes integration and the cluster name set for the integration must match the one reported in the span. Create relationships manually You can create additional relationships using NerdGraph, our GraphQL API. Relationships can be created or replaced using the mutation entityRelationshipUserDefinedCreateOrReplace. As its name suggests, it allows you to create a relationship between two entities with a given type. If the relationship already exists between the two entities, it will be added again with the updated given values: the creation time and the creator user id: mutation { entityRelationshipUserDefinedCreateOrReplace( sourceEntityGuid: \"{SourceEntityGuid}\" targetEntityGuid: \"{TargetEntityGuid}\" type: BUILT_FROM ) { errors { message type } } } Copy Delete relationships using the mutation entityRelationshipUserDefinedDelete. source and target are mandatory, whereas type isn't. If the mutation its executed without any type, all the relationships between the two entities will be removed. mutation { entityRelationshipUserDefinedDelete( sourceEntityGuid: \"{SourceEntityGuid}\" targetEntityGuid: \"{TargetEntityGuid}\" type: BUILT_FROM ) { errors { message type } } } Copy Find information about fetching relationships in the relationships API tutorial. Some considerations Two entities can have multiple relationships, one for each relationship type. Two entities can hold a relationship IF they belong to the same trusted account. For each entity, you can manually define up to 2000 relationships. When the limit is reached, the API will return a LIMIT_EXCEEDED error. Each mutation can fail if you don't have access to one of the two entities (source/target). Relationship types provide additional information about how two entities are related. The supported relationship types are: Relationship types Type Description CALLS The relationship between one service or application calling another. Used to display upstream and downstream services. CONTAINS The relationship and hierarchical use cases common to modern and cloud infrastructure. For example, this could indicate that the HOST contains a container. HOSTS The relationship between an application or process and the system it runs on. SERVES The relationship between a back-end application and the browser application it returns in the response. is The relationship between an entity captured as a separate entity by another telemetry data source and the one you're currently viewing. CONNECTS_TO The source entity has a connection to the target entity. BUILT_FROM The target entity contains the code for the source entity.",

It allows you to see only entities of the selected type, as it updates the filter from the filterbar. Create a new workload for meaningful groupings of your monitored entities. Add more data to instrument more elements of your system and achieve full stack observability. List view Your monitored entities are on the left, in a collapsable menu. You may need to scroll your list of entities to see them all. The list view also has a collapsable activity stream on the right side. You can see different useful events related to the first 25 alerting entities which are currently being filtered. Click on any entity for more details on its performance. The entity overview also incorporates the relationship between the selected entity and other entities in your system. New Relic Navigator The New Relic Navigator makes it easy to explore large numbers of entities as it intuitively displays the entire estate of your system in a highly dense honeycomb view with traffic light colors based on alerts. With the New Relic Navigator you can: Quickly explore the health of your environment at a glance.

Group and filter across all your entities to quickly zero in on issues. Click on any entity to see a mini-overview of its activity, metrics, and meta-data. New Relic Lookout New Relic Lookout provides an intuitive view of entities that are deviating from normal behavior, using circle visualization with color indicating severity and size conveying the scale of recent changes. You don’t need to configure anything: New Relic Lookout automatically compares performance within the last five minutes against the previous hour. Use New Relic Lookout to: Select the entity type to see golden signals of throughput, response time, and errors across all your accounts. Zoom in with correlations, abnormal history, traces, and the ability to leverage New Relic’s profiles across your estate. Click on an entity of interest to access the mini-overview component. Read more about New Relic Lookout. Tip You can modify the color palette to focus on clusters of interest. Understand the state of your system with the health (alert) status The New Relic Explorer shows a color-coded health status for entities. For example, you may see a red alert status indicating a critical violation in progress. To see what an alert status means, mouse over it. To see details about an entity's alerting status, select the entity. NRQL alert conditions aren't used to determine alert status because they aren't associated with specific entities. Important Starting June 8, 2020, New Relic One will not continue to display any APM application that hasn't reported data for 93 days. To match our published APM data retention guidelines, applications that have not reported data will be available within the New Relic UI for 90 days. After 90 days, those applications will be removed from the UI; however, key metrics will continue to be available via the New Relic REST API based on subscription level. For more information, see New Relic's Explorers Hub post. Filter entities using the filterbar The filterbar lets you select the entities displayed according to the conditions you enter: Type in a string of characters and/or numbers (for example, an environment) to find any entity that has this string in their name or ID. When typing, the UI suggests items that coincide with the string you're entering, so you can select one of those from the dropdown. You can also filter by the name of the entity, the entity type, account ID, environment, or a tag. Tip Selection parameters, once created, have a blue background. If you filter using a string, the filter will have the = operator. If you filter using the dropdown menu, once the first element of the searched item (tag key or attribute) is entered, you need to select an operator (=, !=, LIKE, NOT_LIKE, IN, NOT IN) for your filter. Once the operator is selected, complete the filter by selecting the value to complete the search item. To add more filters, first you have to select an operator, AND or OR. Use AND to indicate you want to restrict the selection removing entities from the list of results. You can also use the AND operator to add conditions that need to be met in the list of results, for example, entityType = Services AND location = APAC. Note that entityType = Services AND entityType = Hosts doesn’t return any results, as entities can only have one type and no entity would match this condition. Use OR to add more entities to the selection. For example, the filter entityType = Services OR entityType = Hosts returns every entity you have access to that is of type Services or Hosts. Entity data retention Availability of data depends on these factors: Scope Data retention New Relic Explorer and search In the UI, data is available for eight days after an entity no longer exists, with one exception: data reported by integrations, such as Amazon AWS, is only available for one day after an entity ceases to exist. Our database (accessible via NRQL query) For querying our database (for example, via the query builder or data explorer), availability is dependent on the data retention for that data type. As a result of these factors, a short-lived entity (like a cloud host) may not be available in the explorer list or via search, but its data may still be available via NRQL query.",

      "body": "In the software industry, a tag typically refers to a piece of metadata added to a data set for the purpose of improving data organization and findability. At New Relic, our tags are key:value pairs (like team: operations) added to various sets of data, like monitored apps and hosts, agents, dashboards, and workloads. We make some important attributes available as tags (for example, app metadata like app name and language, and host metadata like host name and AWS region). You can also add your own custom tags. You can use tags in the UI to filter down to relevant data. Here is an example: Here you can see an accountId tag being used to filter workloads to a specific account. Tags help you to: Organize data coming from a large number of sources and/or to a large number of New Relic accounts. Identify teams, roles, environments, or regions to know who’s responsible for what (see example use cases). Better organize and search dashboards and workloads. Query and chart APM data. Tags are useful for organizing data at a high level. If you want to add more fine-grained detail, like capturing user names or other high-cardinality values, custom attributes or custom events are a better solution. Tip Tags were previously called labels in the New Relic UI. You may sometimes see labelin our code; for example, some of our APM agent config files use a label config option for tags. Tag format and limits Format requirements and limits for tags: The UI has limits on the total number of tags it can display per entity: Limit of 100 for tags reported by default or added via agent/integration configuration. Limit of 100 for custom tags added via UI or API. The following are maximum character length for tags: Key: 128 characters Value: 256 characters Allowed characters: Characters must be UTF-8. When using NerdGraph to add tags, a dash (-) in a tag key is interpreted as a minus symbol. If your tag key has a dash, use back ticks around it (like `key-name`). Best practices and tips Before adding tags, we recommend first seeing how our default tags work for you. When you're ready to add your own tags, review the following best practices tips to get the most out of them. Tips on keeping tags simple: Start by adding only tags you know you’ll definitely use. Unused tags create noise and may add confusion. Try to use short tags. Shorter tags are easier to parse, and also the UI may sometimes truncate longer tags. (See character limits.) When possible, use keys and values that are human-readable (for example, region: EMEA is better than Param8323 : 1229072). Avoid including several values like regions: EMEA | US | LATAM in a single tag. We recommend using three different tags for that, like region: emea, region: us, and region: latam. If you want to match multiple tags, you can do that using the advanced options in the filter UI. Tips on using tags consistently: Try to be consistent with tag language across your teams and entities. Be consistent with naming. For example, avoid using both region: emea and reg: emea. Be consistent with format. For example, avoid using both camelCase and kebab-case. Although tag searching is not case-sensitive in the UI and API, try to be consistent with capitalization. For example, avoid using both env: staging and env: Staging. Tips on cross-team implementation: Tags help improve observability and cost allocation. For this reason, responsibility for tag implementation is often assigned to an observability team, SREs, a group of architects, or a cross-team task force. We recommend the people responsible for implementing tags meet and create an internal policy to describe how the tags are defined and which conventions are to be used. Then: Keep this reference manual up to date. Automate the definition of tags when you deploy New Relic agents, at the cloud provider, or through New Relic automation tools, such as the API or Terraform. Create recurring reports that identify entities that are non-compliant with your tagging standards. Tag examples Here are some examples of common ways to use tags to organize data: Team-related tags Creating tags for team names can be helpful to understand which team, group, department, or region was responsible for a change that led to a performance issue. Team examples: team: backend team: frontend team: db Role examples: roles: architecture roles: devops roles: pm Region examples: region: emea region: america region: asia Environment-related tags You can create entities for the environment they belong to. Examples: env: production env: qa env: development env: staging Criticality-related tags You can create tags related to criticality levels, which lets you easier track the most critical issues. Examples: layer: level1 layer: level2 layer: level3 How tags are added Some important attributes, by default, are available for use as tags. For example, the account name, the account ID, and some basic host/server metadata are available as default tags. You can't remove these available-by-default tags. Here are some details about how tags are added for some specific data sources: Add tags via UI or API When you add tags via the UI or API, this occurs at the entity level. This means that, for example, if you have multiple APM agents monitoring a single entity and apply a tag via the UI, that tag is available for all data coming from that entity. To add or delete tags via the UI: Select a monitored entity, like a monitored app or host. Near the entity’s name at the top of the page, select the See metadata and manage tags menu. In the menu that pops up, add or delete a tag. For APM agents, restart your service. To manage tags via API: see our NerdGraph tagging docs. For a guide to using our CLI to automate tagging, see our developer site. APM agent tags You can add tags via the UI and API or you can add tags using APM agent configuration, both methods require you to restart your service. There are differences in how these apply tags: Via agent config: These tags are applied at the agent-level, not the entity/application level. This would be a good option if you have multiple agents monitoring different aspects of the same app (for example, a blue-green deployment model). Via the UI or API: These tags are applied at the entity/application level. Here are links to the agent configuration options: C SDK: not available Java Go .NET Node.js PHP Python Ruby For information on querying APM tags, see Query APM tags. And check out this short video on querying APM tags (3:20 minutes). Infrastructure data tags There are several ways tags are added to infrastructure entities and services: Use the UI or API to add tags at the entity level. Infrastructure agent: some attributes are available by default as tags. You can also add custom attributes, which are also available as tags in the UI. On-host integrations: some attributes are available by default as tags. You can also add tags by using integration-specific labels config options (for an example, see the labels config for the Apache integration). Cloud service integrations: by default we report tags and labels that are defined in the cloud service. To add tags, you'd add them on the cloud-service-side. Automate tags with our CLI For a guide to automating tags using our CLI tool, see our developer site. Use tags to filter the UI Use the filter field at the top of the New Relic Explorer to filter down to the entities you care about. You can use multiple filter conditions. To filter down to certain entities using tags: From one.newrelic.com, click Explorer. Click the Filter by... field to see a dropdown of available attributes and tags. You can filter by multiple elements and use advanced search options. To find an entity’s metadata and tags from the UI, here are two options: From a list of entities in the UI, at the far right, select an entity's icon. OR Select an entity. Near the top of the page, select the icon. To use the API to view tags, see our NerdGraph docs. Learn about how to use tags with dashboards and how to use tags with workloads. Custom queries, charts, and alerts Different features handle tags differently. Here are some details about how you can use NRQL to query tag data, or create NRQL condition alerts. Query and alert on APM tags You can query APM tags using NRQL.

Here is the error rate for all services on a team called team-b. And this alert will automatically monitor any new app names added with the team tag.

      "body": "New Relic monitoring is built around the concept of entities. In this doc, you'll learn how we define entities, what you can do with them, and how you can create your own entities or groupings of entities. What's an entity? From a New Relic perspective, entity is purposefully a broad concept. An entity is anything that a) reports data to New Relic or that contains data that we have access to, and b) is something we've identified with a unique entity ID. For most entities, the ID is indicated by the attribute entityGuid. An entity can be any fundamental data-reporting component, like an application, a host, or a database service, but it can also refer to larger groupings of those components. For example, to monitor a data center, you could aggregate those hosts in New Relic to be a workload (a custom grouping of entities). That workload is, itself, also an entity. Also very important is the relationships between entities. Our behind-the-scenes relationship-mapping helps us understand how entities are connected, how they affect each other. And this allows us to give you the power to configure how any data you're bringing in is related to existing entities, or how it's related to other entities. Our focus on entities and their relationships is important because our goal is to give you practical information about your business-important entities, and not give you an unhelpfully huge stream of data from a huge list of monitored things. With more insight at the entity level, you can better monitor and troubleshoot complex, modern systems. Find and explore entities and entity data Tip You can create new entity types for monitoring any data source. Learn more about entity synthesis. Some tips for finding and understanding entity data: To find an entity's entityGuid and entityName and other metadata: from any list of monitored entities in the New Relic Explorer, click an entity's icon, and click See metadata and tags. For most entities, its GUID is reported as the attribute entityGuid. For workloads, it's workloadGuid. You can run NRQL queries to find entities by their GUID. To see connections between entities, you have several options: When viewing an entity in the UI, use the Related entities UI. Service maps. Distributed tracing. Our NerdGraph API. To group entities together, see Group entities. Customize entity definitions and relationships. To learn technical details about entity types, see our GitHub repo. In an entity type's definition file, you'll see information like: The domain: for example, APM, or Infra. Its type: for example, Application or AWSECSCONTAINERINSTANCE. Default tags. The entityExpirationTime: how long data from that entity lasts in the UI, which is different from database data retention. Group and organize entities You can place entities into groups that reflect business-important relationships in your organization. For example, you might group all entities related to a specific team or department, or related to a specific service. Or you might group multiple hosts together to reflect their grouping in a data center. To group your entities, see: Tag entities. Create workloads, which allow you to group business-important sets of entities. Create entities and customize entity data Customize entity data with entity synthesis If you have telemetry from any source that's not supported by New Relic out of the box, you can propose a mapping for it. Once approved, any telemetry received by New Relic that matches your definition file will be synthesized into an entity. To learn more: For reserved attributes and how entity relationships are defined, keep reading this doc. For how to do the work of modifying existing entity types or creating new ones, see our GitHub repo on entity synthesis. Reserved attributes for synthesized entities These attributes are meant to be synthesized from the telemetry we receive. Do not set them unless you're aware of the implications and consequences. Attribute Description entity.guid Generally, you should not set this attribute field on your telemetry data. New Relic may add this field to ingested data to store a unique identifier for the entity associated with the data point. If telemetry arrives with the entity.guid attribute already present, then New Relic will not change the value. However, it may cause undefined behavior such as missing entities in the UI, or telemetry not associating with the expected entities. One use case for passing this attribute is to associate ingested telemetry with an entity already created by New Relic. When the entity.guid attribute is sent, the value will override New Relic’s entity identification system (such as entity synthesis definitions) and instead will use the attribute as the data. entity.name This attribute shouldn't be put on ingested telemetry data unless you're trying to override the entity name that would have been selected by New Relic’s entity identification system. While New Relic won't change the value if it's already present on the data, New Relic may add the attribute to your data. Therefore invalid or unexpected values may cause undefined behavior such as missing entities in the UI, or telemetry not associating with the expected entities. If this field is present on ingested telemetry, its value will be used to name the entity associated with the data point. This name will be used instead of the name selected by New Relic’s entity identification system (for example, entity synthesis definitions). Note that many entities use the name as part of their identification, so changing this field may result in the generation of a new entity. entity.type This attribute shouldn't be put on ingested telemetry data except for certain legacy cases where it's required to distinguish entity types. Passing this field may interfere with entity detection, particularly if unrecognized values are sent in this field. While New Relic won't change the value if already present on the data, the field is not guaranteed to provide unambiguous filtering of telemetry at query-time. Existing entity definitions already have overlapping values, and we recommend avoiding entity.type in favor of other fields for filtering telemetry queries. This field is used by New Relic, meaning that invalid or unexpected values may cause undefined behavior such as missing entities in the UI, or telemetry not associating with the expected entities. To learn how to do the work of modifying existing entity types or creating new ones, see our GitHub repo on entity synthesis. Entity relationships Connections between entities are automatically created by New Relic based on what we can infer from your telemetry. For example, when two services that communicate using HTTP are instrumented with New Relic, we infer a \"calls/called-by\" relationship between them. When viewing a specific entity in either the New Relic Explorer, Navigator, or Lookout, you can see its Related entities in the entity's mini overview. This gives a visualization of the various entities connected directly to the current entity. You can quickly view important metrics for these related entities and navigate from one entity to another, through all the connected parts of your stack. Tip Learn more about how entities are related with our NerdGraph API. When relationships are not automatically detected, you can manually create them using the \"Add/edit related entities\" link in Related entities. Important Currently, you can only manually create calls/called-by relationships between service entities. Tip To manage manual relationships, you need to have modify and delete capabilities on entity relationships. If you don’t see the edit relationships button, contact your account admin. Which relationships are created? These are the relationships created between entities: Source: New Relic agent Relationship source Relationship type Relationship target Why is the relationship created? Application instrumented with a New Relic agent CALLS Application instrumented with a New Relic agent Relationships between applications monitored by New Relic agents are reported using the DurationByCaller metric. The callee reports the metric. For example, the metric DurationByCaller/Mobile/100/1234/HTTP/all indicates that the caller is APPLICATION 1234 for account 100. Application instrumented with a New Relic agent CALLS Service instrumented with a New Relic agent An application (caller) that calls a service (callee) monitored by New Relic creates a relationship that's reported by the caller using the ExternalApp metric. For example, the metric ExternalApp/dirac.vips.net/100#1234/all indicates that the callee is APPLICATION 1234 for account 100. The metric is reported if the callee successfully responds to the caller. Service instrumented with a New Relic agent CALLS Service instrumented with a New Relic agent When a New Relic agent detects that a service (caller) calls another service (callee) instrumented by New Relic, the callee reports the metric ClientApplication. For example, the metric ClientApplication/100#1234/all indicates that the caller is APPLICATION 1234 for account 100. Service instrumented with a New Relic agent CALLS A datastore instance When an application calls a datastore instance it creates a relationship reported with the DatastoreInstance metric. For example, the metric Datastore/instance/MySQL/172.16.16.3/3306 indicates the datastore instance is vendor: MySQL, host: 172.16.16.3, port: 3306. This metric also supports the legacy datastore instance format Datastore/instance/MySQL/172.16.16.3:3306. Currently we cannot determine whether the datastore instance is instrumented by New Relic and has an entity associated to it. APM agent SERVES Browser agent This relationship is created when an APM agent injects the browser agent into a page. Workload entity CONTAINS Any entity When a workload is created or updated, relationships for each of the entities that belong to the workload are created. Because some workloads are “dynamic” (defined by tags), relationships are re-created every 5 minutes. This way entities can join or leave the workload. Source: Infrastructure Relationship source Relationship type Relationship target Why is the relationship created? Infrastructure host HOSTS Application This relationship is created when an application is running in one or more hosts, and the infra agent is running in those hosts. Infrastructure host HOSTS Container This relationship is created when containers are running in one or more hosts, and the host is instrumented with the infra agent. Source: Synthetics monitor Relationship source Relationship type Relationship target Why is the relationship created? Synthetics Monitor CALLS Browser agent This relationship is created when a synthetics monitor checks a page instrumented with the browser agent. Synthetics Monitor CALLS APM application Agent events that contain the attribute nr.syntheticsMonitorId have been described as synthetics monitors (the source) interacting with an APM application (the target). If the header exists and the APM application Id exists, a relationship is created between the monitor and the app. Source: Kubernetes Relationship source Relationship type Relationship target Why is the relationship created? Cluster CONTAINS Pod This relationship is created when a pod is created in a cluster instrumented with the New Relic Kubernetes integration. Cluster CONTAINS Deployment This relationship is created when a deployment is created in a cluster instrumented with the New Relic Kubernetes integration. Cluster CONTAINS DaemonSet This relationship is created when a DaemonSet is created in a cluster instrumented with the New Relic Kubernetes integration. Cluster CONTAINS StatefulSet This relationship is created when a StatefulSet is created in a cluster instrumented with the New Relic Kubernetes integration. Cluster CONTAINS Host This relationship is created when a host that's part of a cluster is instrumented with the New Relic Kubernetes integration. Deployment CONTAINS Pod This relationship is created when a deployment creates a pod in a cluster instrumented with the New Relic Kubernetes integration. DaemonSet CONTAINS Pod This relationship is created when a DaemonSet is created a pod in a cluster instrumented with the New Relic Kubernetes integration. StatefulSet CONTAINS Pod This relationship is created when a StatefulSet creates a pod in a cluster instrumented with the New Relic Kubernetes integration. Pod CONTAINS Container This relationship is created when a pod creates a container in a cluster instrumented with the New Relic Kubernetes integration. Host HOSTS Pod This relationship is created when a pod is running in a host that's part of a cluster instrumented with the New Relic Kubernetes integration. Container HOSTS Application This relationship is created when an application is running in docker, and the hosts where docker is running are instrumented by the the infra agent. External services Relationship source Relationship type Relationship target Why is the relationship created? External service CALLS External service When the relationship is created, the external service reports a span with its name on the service.name attribute and the name of the service that initiates the call in the parent.service.name attribute. Application IS External service A relationship between an application and an external service is created so that users can navigate between them using the related entities component. Browser application instrumented with a New Relic agent CALLS External service A browser application reports an Ajax/HostTransaction metric when calling an external service (URL). Example metric: Ajax/HostTransaction/api.segment.io:443/CallbackTime' Cluster CONTAINS External service When the relationship is created, the external service reports a span with the attribute k8s.cluster.name, the name of the cluster. The cluster must be instrumented with the New Relic Kubernetes integration and the cluster name set for the integration must match the one reported in the span. Pod HOSTS External service When the relationship is created, the external service reports a span with the following attributes: service.name: The name of the service. k8s.cluster.name: The name of the cluster. k8s.pod.name: The name of the pod that’s running the service. k8s.namespace.name: The namespace where the pod was created. The cluster must be instrumented with the New Relic Kubernetes integration and the cluster name set for the integration must match the one reported in the span. Create relationships manually You can create additional relationships using NerdGraph, our GraphQL API. Relationships can be created or replaced using the mutation entityRelationshipUserDefinedCreateOrReplace. As its name suggests, it allows you to create a relationship between two entities with a given type. If the relationship already exists between the two entities, it will be added again with the updated given values: the creation time and the creator user id: mutation { entityRelationshipUserDefinedCreateOrReplace( sourceEntityGuid: \"{SourceEntityGuid}\" targetEntityGuid: \"{TargetEntityGuid}\" type: BUILT_FROM ) { errors { message type } } } Copy Delete relationships using the mutation entityRelationshipUserDefinedDelete. source and target are mandatory, whereas type isn't. If the mutation its executed without any type, all the relationships between the two entities will be removed. mutation { entityRelationshipUserDefinedDelete( sourceEntityGuid: \"{SourceEntityGuid}\" targetEntityGuid: \"{TargetEntityGuid}\" type: BUILT_FROM ) { errors { message type } } } Copy Find information about fetching relationships in the relationships API tutorial. Some considerations Two entities can have multiple relationships, one for each relationship type. Two entities can hold a relationship IF they belong to the same trusted account. For each entity, you can manually define up to 2000 relationships. When the limit is reached, the API will return a LIMIT_EXCEEDED error. Each mutation can fail if you don't have access to one of the two entities (source/target). Relationship types provide additional information about how two entities are related. The supported relationship types are: Relationship types Type Description CALLS The relationship between one service or application calling another. Used to display upstream and downstream services. CONTAINS The relationship and hierarchical use cases common to modern and cloud infrastructure. For example, this could indicate that the HOST contains a container. HOSTS The relationship between an application or process and the system it runs on. SERVES The relationship between a back-end application and the browser application it returns in the response. is The relationship between an entity captured as a separate entity by another telemetry data source and the one you're currently viewing. CONNECTS_TO The source entity has a connection to the target entity. BUILT_FROM The target entity contains the code for the source entity.",

      "body": "New Relic Lookout provides visibility into your entire estate. It doesn't require any configuration — you can query anything in your estate that matters to you right now and understand your system as a whole, or dive deep into causes and effects, so you can quickly get the data you need to take action. Know exactly where to focus your attention with New Relic Lookout. The brighter the color, the more severe the change, and the bigger the size, the bigger the scale. Then dig deeper with correlations and abnormal history to see how it impacts your whole system—no configuration needed. Why it matters New Relic Lookout helps software teams of any size discover potential issues before they have an impact. Fill gaps in monitoring with full coverage out-of-the-box, no configuration or setup required. Immediately see anything deviating from normal across your entire estate. Proactively spot emerging problems in a real-time visualization of all system components. Gain faster incidents resolution through automatically surfaced causes and effects. Analyze any data in New Relic database (NRDB), including third-party, open, and custom data. Launch into other areas of New Relic One for deeper understanding Requirements New Relic Lookout requires Pro or Enterprise edition. If you are on Standard edition, you can still use the New Relic Lookout view in the New Relic Explorer. If you want to see data spanning 13-months, correlations, profiles, traces, and other details, you must upgrade to a higher edition. Get started with New Relic Lookout To access New Relic Lookout, click the Apps button in New Relic One and locate the New Relic Lookout launcher. You can also access New Relic Lookout directly from the New Relic One header bar, via the More dropdown. Enablement of key service performance indicator data is required for New Relic Lookout to provide value from the data you already have. The default view provides insight into three key Service performance indicators broken down by application: throughput, response time, and errors. These metrics are analyzed to show how the data has behaved during the last five minutes compared to the prior hour. one.newrelic.com > Apps > New Relic Lookout: Anything that significantly deviates from the trend is automatically discovered by New Relic Lookout, which doesn't require any configuration. Circle visualization and table view Each application (or other facet) is represented by a circle. The size of the circles indicate the magnitude of the signal for that application and the color indicates whether the value has significantly decreased or increased in the last five minutes, based on the standard deviation of the prior hour (default evaluation and comparison time windows.) Please note that the type of signal is important when interpreting your results. When you first look at the legend below, you might be tempted to interpret yellow as good and dark purple as bad, but that is not always the case. Here are some examples: In the APM/services golden signals, a dark yellow circle in Throughput might signify that something bad has occurred and led to a drop in traffic. At the same time, a dark purple circle might also be concerning due to unexpected load. Both are significant findings worth exploring. In browser golden signals, a dark purple circle in Page Views might be great, as you are seeing more traffic to your site! With errors golden signals (in all entity types), a large circle, even if gray (not deviating from normal volume), is worth exploring because a high count of errors in your system is important to investigate. The legend allows you to change the colors used to highlight deviating services To change the color palette, click the gear icon by the low-high color legend. This allows you to change the colors used to highlight deviating services. To get a table view of the same data, click the toggle on the right. You can also hover over each color to filter the view by degree lower or higher deviance. Abnormal golden signals On the right, New Relic Lookout displays the most significantly deviating applications (or other facet) in a side panel, weighted by both the magnitude of the performance indicators and the scale of their deviations. Details include the name of the key performance indicator, their magnitude during the recent time window, and the difference between the averages from one time compared to the other. Instant search Click the magnifying glass icon in the side panel to open a search box. Typing into the search box filters the circles, table, and abnormal signals to applications (or other facets) that contain the text. This is a good way to quickly zoom to various subsystems. New Relic Lookout doesn't rerun the analysis when using the instant search. Change view Click the Change View button on the right side panel. The panel that appears shows you all the entity-specific golden signals you can toggle between out of the box. By choosing the Browser Golden Signal or other views, you can change from the default view. Each new view will have the golden signals appropriate for that entity type. Drill down into the details To analyze an application or facet, click a circle, table row, or abnormal golden signal. The details panel shows the degree of deviation of the performance indicator, a link to the affected entity, and recent alert and deployment activity for that entity, when available. There’s also an indication of whether the selected evaluation time period would be abnormal or not in reference to other comparison time windows, such as the same time yesterday or the same time last week. This allows you to quickly see if the abnormal behavior is odd in general, or just based on the comparison time window. Performance tab The default tab shows charts for other key performance indicators for the selected application or facet. The charts compare the two time windows being analyzed. You can click their titles to rerun the analysis, focusing on the selected key performance indicator. When the target is a New Relic One application, we show the top transactions, error classes, external services, and database operations, alongside links to the relevant New Relic One features. Abnormal History tab This section analyzes past performance of the selected signal and calls out any time periods with notable abnormalities. Each card represents an abnormal time window and can be clicked for more details. The charts will display any relevant violations and deployments in New Relic. Correlations tab New Relic Lookout can find other signals that began behaving differently around the same time as the selected signal for that entity type. Clicking the name of the signal reruns the analysis, focusing on that key performance indicator. The chart titles link to New Relic One when there’s an associated entity in your account. Note that correlations currently do not analyze across accounts. The correlated signals displayed are for others in the account of the original application you are viewing. This helps focus the data on correlations that are more likely related to your issue. Profile tab Based on the same technology as New Relic’s error profiles, this tab compares the last five minutes to the prior hour by default (or whatever time windows you’ve selected with query editing) and surfaces any attributes that have significantly different distributions in the events being targeted by the selected signal. For example, if a custom attribute indicated that a recent throughput spike came from one user, that would surface highly in Profiles if most of the traffic usually comes from many users. Traces tab If the entity has distributed traces configured and available in the selected evaluated time window, the Traces section is enabled. Each card shows a summary of a trace and can be clicked for details. The Explore all traces links to the distributed traces application, filtered to the selected entity. Create a custom view To target signals and time windows beyond the default values, click the Change view button and select Custom view. To create your own view: Select the account or subaccount. Select the data type (metrics or events). Different functionality is available depending on the type. In View a chart with, select the metric or event you are interested in. Default is golden signals (throughput, response time, and errors). You can also build custom queries (filters) to target a signal that isn't on the list. In Facet by, select what the circles represent. Default is appName, but you can also choose host or any other facetable attribute available for the signal you’ve selected. If you plan to save/favorite this new view, provide a name in the Name your view box. Keep in mind that you can edit this view at any time using the pencil icon. The default time windows analyzed by New Relic Lookout are the last five minutes compared to the hour before. Use the time controls (View data from and Compare data to) to target other time windows. one.newrelic.com > Apps > New Relic Lookout: All event and metric data in the New Relic database can be queried using the Edit query feature. Click Analyze to begin analyzing the signal you’ve selected. You can also create your own query: Create your query. This query is comparing data from the past thirty minutes to data from the same range a day ago. Change from Basic to Advanced after clicking the Custom view button. Select the data type (metrics or events). Different functionality is available depending on the type. Enter your query using NRQL. Please note that not all NRQL features are available in the Lookout Advanced query feature. By default, the system will run this query using the last five minutes of data compared to the previous hour. Some examples of the syntax for changing the comparison and evaluation time windows are below. Click Analyze to begin analyzing the signal you’ve selected. Query: Compare the last 15 minutes to the same time 1 day ago Please note that the UNTIL NOW portion is required here unlike in standard NRQL. Without the UNTIL NOW added, the system will query a 5 minute slice of data starting 15 minutes ago SINCE 15 minutes AGO UNTIL NOW COMPARE WITH 1 day ago Copy Query: Compare a specific time range to the same range a month ago SINCE '2021-03-07 07:00:00-0500' UNTIL '2021-03-08 07:00:00-0500' COMPARE WITH 1 month ago Copy Or: SINCE 'today at midnight' UNTIL 'now' COMPARE WITH 1 MONTH AGO Copy Example: Unusual increases in error count The default view of New Relic Lookout shows application status across your estate, comparing the last five minutes to the hour before. Under regular operation, most large systems may have a handful of abnormalities, but usually most things will indicate normal behavior. Suddenly, several circles begin to change to red under the Errors section. This indicates that several applications are experiencing unusual increases in error count. It may be that one or two circles for important systems are red, and perhaps much larger than they usually appear. Clicking one of these can provide more information on what is happening. You might see that the error rate is substantially elevated, even thousands of percent higher than normal. To troubleshoot this issue, here's what you might discover in the New Relic Lookout tabs: Performance would show you data about other signals, illuminating the characteristics of the change in system dynamics. Correlations would surface other applications that are affected and how, as well as opportunities to pivot to other applications that may be closer to the underlying causes. Traces, in turn, would show distributed traces, which can provide specific examples of traffic running through those systems. Abnormal history would show other times in the past week with elevated errors, showing whether or not this problem happens regularly, such as every day at the same time or whenever there is a deployment. Profiles might show that all or most of the new errors share common properties, such as all being isolated to just one region/account/user. Combining the information from these sections, not only can you get a sense of what is going on, but also where to focus actions to resolve the problem.",

      "body": "New Relic monitoring is built around the concept of entities. In this doc, you'll learn how we define entities, what you can do with them, and how you can create your own entities or groupings of entities. What's an entity? From a New Relic perspective, entity is purposefully a broad concept. An entity is anything that a) reports data to New Relic or that contains data that we have access to, and b) is something we've identified with a unique entity ID. For most entities, the ID is indicated by the attribute entityGuid. An entity can be any fundamental data-reporting component, like an application, a host, or a database service, but it can also refer to larger groupings of those components. For example, to monitor a data center, you could aggregate those hosts in New Relic to be a workload (a custom grouping of entities). That workload is, itself, also an entity. Also very important is the relationships between entities. Our behind-the-scenes relationship-mapping helps us understand how entities are connected, how they affect each other. And this allows us to give you the power to configure how any data you're bringing in is related to existing entities, or how it's related to other entities. Our focus on entities and their relationships is important because our goal is to give you practical information about your business-important entities, and not give you an unhelpfully huge stream of data from a huge list of monitored things. With more insight at the entity level, you can better monitor and troubleshoot complex, modern systems. Find and explore entities and entity data Tip You can create new entity types for monitoring any data source. Learn more about entity synthesis. Some tips for finding and understanding entity data: To find an entity's entityGuid and entityName and other metadata: from any list of monitored entities in the New Relic Explorer, click an entity's icon, and click See metadata and tags. For most entities, its GUID is reported as the attribute entityGuid. For workloads, it's workloadGuid. You can run NRQL queries to find entities by their GUID. To see connections between entities, you have several options: When viewing an entity in the UI, use the Related entities UI. Service maps. Distributed tracing. Our NerdGraph API. To group entities together, see Group entities. Customize entity definitions and relationships. To learn technical details about entity types, see our GitHub repo. In an entity type's definition file, you'll see information like: The domain: for example, APM, or Infra. Its type: for example, Application or AWSECSCONTAINERINSTANCE. Default tags. The entityExpirationTime: how long data from that entity lasts in the UI, which is different from database data retention. Group and organize entities You can place entities into groups that reflect business-important relationships in your organization. For example, you might group all entities related to a specific team or department, or related to a specific service. Or you might group multiple hosts together to reflect their grouping in a data center. To group your entities, see: Tag entities. Create workloads, which allow you to group business-important sets of entities. Create entities and customize entity data Customize entity data with entity synthesis If you have telemetry from any source that's not supported by New Relic out of the box, you can propose a mapping for it. Once approved, any telemetry received by New Relic that matches your definition file will be synthesized into an entity. To learn more: For reserved attributes and how entity relationships are defined, keep reading this doc. For how to do the work of modifying existing entity types or creating new ones, see our GitHub repo on entity synthesis. Reserved attributes for synthesized entities These attributes are meant to be synthesized from the telemetry we receive. Do not set them unless you're aware of the implications and consequences. Attribute Description entity.guid Generally, you should not set this attribute field on your telemetry data. New Relic may add this field to ingested data to store a unique identifier for the entity associated with the data point. If telemetry arrives with the entity.guid attribute already present, then New Relic will not change the value. However, it may cause undefined behavior such as missing entities in the UI, or telemetry not associating with the expected entities. One use case for passing this attribute is to associate ingested telemetry with an entity already created by New Relic. When the entity.guid attribute is sent, the value will override New Relic’s entity identification system (such as entity synthesis definitions) and instead will use the attribute as the data. entity.name This attribute shouldn't be put on ingested telemetry data unless you're trying to override the entity name that would have been selected by New Relic’s entity identification system. While New Relic won't change the value if it's already present on the data, New Relic may add the attribute to your data. Therefore invalid or unexpected values may cause undefined behavior such as missing entities in the UI, or telemetry not associating with the expected entities. If this field is present on ingested telemetry, its value will be used to name the entity associated with the data point. This name will be used instead of the name selected by New Relic’s entity identification system (for example, entity synthesis definitions). Note that many entities use the name as part of their identification, so changing this field may result in the generation of a new entity. entity.type This attribute shouldn't be put on ingested telemetry data except for certain legacy cases where it's required to distinguish entity types. Passing this field may interfere with entity detection, particularly if unrecognized values are sent in this field. While New Relic won't change the value if already present on the data, the field is not guaranteed to provide unambiguous filtering of telemetry at query-time. Existing entity definitions already have overlapping values, and we recommend avoiding entity.type in favor of other fields for filtering telemetry queries. This field is used by New Relic, meaning that invalid or unexpected values may cause undefined behavior such as missing entities in the UI, or telemetry not associating with the expected entities. To learn how to do the work of modifying existing entity types or creating new ones, see our GitHub repo on entity synthesis. Entity relationships Connections between entities are automatically created by New Relic based on what we can infer from your telemetry. For example, when two services that communicate using HTTP are instrumented with New Relic, we infer a \"calls/called-by\" relationship between them. When viewing a specific entity in either the New Relic Explorer, Navigator, or Lookout, you can see its Related entities in the entity's mini overview. This gives a visualization of the various entities connected directly to the current entity. You can quickly view important metrics for these related entities and navigate from one entity to another, through all the connected parts of your stack. Tip Learn more about how entities are related with our NerdGraph API. When relationships are not automatically detected, you can manually create them using the \"Add/edit related entities\" link in Related entities. Important Currently, you can only manually create calls/called-by relationships between service entities. Tip To manage manual relationships, you need to have modify and delete capabilities on entity relationships. If you don’t see the edit relationships button, contact your account admin. Which relationships are created? These are the relationships created between entities: Source: New Relic agent Relationship source Relationship type Relationship target Why is the relationship created? Application instrumented with a New Relic agent CALLS Application instrumented with a New Relic agent Relationships between applications monitored by New Relic agents are reported using the DurationByCaller metric. The callee reports the metric. For example, the metric DurationByCaller/Mobile/100/1234/HTTP/all indicates that the caller is APPLICATION 1234 for account 100. Application instrumented with a New Relic agent CALLS Service instrumented with a New Relic agent An application (caller) that calls a service (callee) monitored by New Relic creates a relationship that's reported by the caller using the ExternalApp metric. For example, the metric ExternalApp/dirac.vips.net/100#1234/all indicates that the callee is APPLICATION 1234 for account 100. The metric is reported if the callee successfully responds to the caller. Service instrumented with a New Relic agent CALLS Service instrumented with a New Relic agent When a New Relic agent detects that a service (caller) calls another service (callee) instrumented by New Relic, the callee reports the metric ClientApplication. For example, the metric ClientApplication/100#1234/all indicates that the caller is APPLICATION 1234 for account 100. Service instrumented with a New Relic agent CALLS A datastore instance When an application calls a datastore instance it creates a relationship reported with the DatastoreInstance metric. For example, the metric Datastore/instance/MySQL/172.16.16.3/3306 indicates the datastore instance is vendor: MySQL, host: 172.16.16.3, port: 3306. This metric also supports the legacy datastore instance format Datastore/instance/MySQL/172.16.16.3:3306. Currently we cannot determine whether the datastore instance is instrumented by New Relic and has an entity associated to it. APM agent SERVES Browser agent This relationship is created when an APM agent injects the browser agent into a page. Workload entity CONTAINS Any entity When a workload is created or updated, relationships for each of the entities that belong to the workload are created. Because some workloads are “dynamic” (defined by tags), relationships are re-created every 5 minutes. This way entities can join or leave the workload. Source: Infrastructure Relationship source Relationship type Relationship target Why is the relationship created? Infrastructure host HOSTS Application This relationship is created when an application is running in one or more hosts, and the infra agent is running in those hosts. Infrastructure host HOSTS Container This relationship is created when containers are running in one or more hosts, and the host is instrumented with the infra agent. Source: Synthetics monitor Relationship source Relationship type Relationship target Why is the relationship created? Synthetics Monitor CALLS Browser agent This relationship is created when a synthetics monitor checks a page instrumented with the browser agent. Synthetics Monitor CALLS APM application Agent events that contain the attribute nr.syntheticsMonitorId have been described as synthetics monitors (the source) interacting with an APM application (the target). If the header exists and the APM application Id exists, a relationship is created between the monitor and the app. Source: Kubernetes Relationship source Relationship type Relationship target Why is the relationship created? Cluster CONTAINS Pod This relationship is created when a pod is created in a cluster instrumented with the New Relic Kubernetes integration. Cluster CONTAINS Deployment This relationship is created when a deployment is created in a cluster instrumented with the New Relic Kubernetes integration. Cluster CONTAINS DaemonSet This relationship is created when a DaemonSet is created in a cluster instrumented with the New Relic Kubernetes integration. Cluster CONTAINS StatefulSet This relationship is created when a StatefulSet is created in a cluster instrumented with the New Relic Kubernetes integration. Cluster CONTAINS Host This relationship is created when a host that's part of a cluster is instrumented with the New Relic Kubernetes integration. Deployment CONTAINS Pod This relationship is created when a deployment creates a pod in a cluster instrumented with the New Relic Kubernetes integration. DaemonSet CONTAINS Pod This relationship is created when a DaemonSet is created a pod in a cluster instrumented with the New Relic Kubernetes integration. StatefulSet CONTAINS Pod This relationship is created when a StatefulSet creates a pod in a cluster instrumented with the New Relic Kubernetes integration. Pod CONTAINS Container This relationship is created when a pod creates a container in a cluster instrumented with the New Relic Kubernetes integration. Host HOSTS Pod This relationship is created when a pod is running in a host that's part of a cluster instrumented with the New Relic Kubernetes integration. Container HOSTS Application This relationship is created when an application is running in docker, and the hosts where docker is running are instrumented by the the infra agent. External services Relationship source Relationship type Relationship target Why is the relationship created? External service CALLS External service When the relationship is created, the external service reports a span with its name on the service.name attribute and the name of the service that initiates the call in the parent.service.name attribute. Application IS External service A relationship between an application and an external service is created so that users can navigate between them using the related entities component. Browser application instrumented with a New Relic agent CALLS External service A browser application reports an Ajax/HostTransaction metric when calling an external service (URL). Example metric: Ajax/HostTransaction/api.segment.io:443/CallbackTime' Cluster CONTAINS External service When the relationship is created, the external service reports a span with the attribute k8s.cluster.name, the name of the cluster. The cluster must be instrumented with the New Relic Kubernetes integration and the cluster name set for the integration must match the one reported in the span. Pod HOSTS External service When the relationship is created, the external service reports a span with the following attributes: service.name: The name of the service. k8s.cluster.name: The name of the cluster. k8s.pod.name: The name of the pod that’s running the service. k8s.namespace.name: The namespace where the pod was created. The cluster must be instrumented with the New Relic Kubernetes integration and the cluster name set for the integration must match the one reported in the span. Create relationships manually You can create additional relationships using NerdGraph, our GraphQL API. Relationships can be created or replaced using the mutation entityRelationshipUserDefinedCreateOrReplace. As its name suggests, it allows you to create a relationship between two entities with a given type. If the relationship already exists between the two entities, it will be added again with the updated given values: the creation time and the creator user id: mutation { entityRelationshipUserDefinedCreateOrReplace( sourceEntityGuid: \"{SourceEntityGuid}\" targetEntityGuid: \"{TargetEntityGuid}\" type: BUILT_FROM ) { errors { message type } } } Copy Delete relationships using the mutation entityRelationshipUserDefinedDelete. source and target are mandatory, whereas type isn't. If the mutation its executed without any type, all the relationships between the two entities will be removed. mutation { entityRelationshipUserDefinedDelete( sourceEntityGuid: \"{SourceEntityGuid}\" targetEntityGuid: \"{TargetEntityGuid}\" type: BUILT_FROM ) { errors { message type } } } Copy Find information about fetching relationships in the relationships API tutorial. Some considerations Two entities can have multiple relationships, one for each relationship type. Two entities can hold a relationship IF they belong to the same trusted account. For each entity, you can manually define up to 2000 relationships. When the limit is reached, the API will return a LIMIT_EXCEEDED error. Each mutation can fail if you don't have access to one of the two entities (source/target). Relationship types provide additional information about how two entities are related. The supported relationship types are: Relationship types Type Description CALLS The relationship between one service or application calling another. Used to display upstream and downstream services. CONTAINS The relationship and hierarchical use cases common to modern and cloud infrastructure. For example, this could indicate that the HOST contains a container. HOSTS The relationship between an application or process and the system it runs on. SERVES The relationship between a back-end application and the browser application it returns in the response. is The relationship between an entity captured as a separate entity by another telemetry data source and the one you're currently viewing. CONNECTS_TO The source entity has a connection to the target entity. BUILT_FROM The target entity contains the code for the source entity.",

      "body": "New Relic Lookout provides visibility into your entire estate. It doesn't require any configuration — you can query anything in your estate that matters to you right now and understand your system as a whole, or dive deep into causes and effects, so you can quickly get the data you need to take action. Know exactly where to focus your attention with New Relic Lookout. The brighter the color, the more severe the change, and the bigger the size, the bigger the scale. Then dig deeper with correlations and abnormal history to see how it impacts your whole system—no configuration needed. Why it matters New Relic Lookout helps software teams of any size discover potential issues before they have an impact. Fill gaps in monitoring with full coverage out-of-the-box, no configuration or setup required. Immediately see anything deviating from normal across your entire estate. Proactively spot emerging problems in a real-time visualization of all system components. Gain faster incidents resolution through automatically surfaced causes and effects. Analyze any data in New Relic database (NRDB), including third-party, open, and custom data. Launch into other areas of New Relic One for deeper understanding Requirements New Relic Lookout requires Pro or Enterprise edition. If you are on Standard edition, you can still use the New Relic Lookout view in the New Relic Explorer. If you want to see data spanning 13-months, correlations, profiles, traces, and other details, you must upgrade to a higher edition. Get started with New Relic Lookout To access New Relic Lookout, click the Apps button in New Relic One and locate the New Relic Lookout launcher. You can also access New Relic Lookout directly from the New Relic One header bar, via the More dropdown. Enablement of key service performance indicator data is required for New Relic Lookout to provide value from the data you already have. The default view provides insight into three key Service performance indicators broken down by application: throughput, response time, and errors. These metrics are analyzed to show how the data has behaved during the last five minutes compared to the prior hour. one.newrelic.com > Apps > New Relic Lookout: Anything that significantly deviates from the trend is automatically discovered by New Relic Lookout, which doesn't require any configuration. Circle visualization and table view Each application (or other facet) is represented by a circle. The size of the circles indicate the magnitude of the signal for that application and the color indicates whether the value has significantly decreased or increased in the last five minutes, based on the standard deviation of the prior hour (default evaluation and comparison time windows.) Please note that the type of signal is important when interpreting your results. When you first look at the legend below, you might be tempted to interpret yellow as good and dark purple as bad, but that is not always the case. Here are some examples: In the APM/services golden signals, a dark yellow circle in Throughput might signify that something bad has occurred and led to a drop in traffic. At the same time, a dark purple circle might also be concerning due to unexpected load. Both are significant findings worth exploring. In browser golden signals, a dark purple circle in Page Views might be great, as you are seeing more traffic to your site! With errors golden signals (in all entity types), a large circle, even if gray (not deviating from normal volume), is worth exploring because a high count of errors in your system is important to investigate. The legend allows you to change the colors used to highlight deviating services To change the color palette, click the gear icon by the low-high color legend. This allows you to change the colors used to highlight deviating services. To get a table view of the same data, click the toggle on the right. You can also hover over each color to filter the view by degree lower or higher deviance. Abnormal golden signals On the right, New Relic Lookout displays the most significantly deviating applications (or other facet) in a side panel, weighted by both the magnitude of the performance indicators and the scale of their deviations. Details include the name of the key performance indicator, their magnitude during the recent time window, and the difference between the averages from one time compared to the other. Instant search Click the magnifying glass icon in the side panel to open a search box. Typing into the search box filters the circles, table, and abnormal signals to applications (or other facets) that contain the text. This is a good way to quickly zoom to various subsystems. New Relic Lookout doesn't rerun the analysis when using the instant search. Change view Click the Change View button on the right side panel. The panel that appears shows you all the entity-specific golden signals you can toggle between out of the box. By choosing the Browser Golden Signal or other views, you can change from the default view. Each new view will have the golden signals appropriate for that entity type. Drill down into the details To analyze an application or facet, click a circle, table row, or abnormal golden signal. The details panel shows the degree of deviation of the performance indicator, a link to the affected entity, and recent alert and deployment activity for that entity, when available. There’s also an indication of whether the selected evaluation time period would be abnormal or not in reference to other comparison time windows, such as the same time yesterday or the same time last week. This allows you to quickly see if the abnormal behavior is odd in general, or just based on the comparison time window. Performance tab The default tab shows charts for other key performance indicators for the selected application or facet. The charts compare the two time windows being analyzed. You can click their titles to rerun the analysis, focusing on the selected key performance indicator. When the target is a New Relic One application, we show the top transactions, error classes, external services, and database operations, alongside links to the relevant New Relic One features. Abnormal History tab This section analyzes past performance of the selected signal and calls out any time periods with notable abnormalities. Each card represents an abnormal time window and can be clicked for more details. The charts will display any relevant violations and deployments in New Relic. Correlations tab New Relic Lookout can find other signals that began behaving differently around the same time as the selected signal for that entity type. Clicking the name of the signal reruns the analysis, focusing on that key performance indicator. The chart titles link to New Relic One when there’s an associated entity in your account. Note that correlations currently do not analyze across accounts. The correlated signals displayed are for others in the account of the original application you are viewing. This helps focus the data on correlations that are more likely related to your issue. Profile tab Based on the same technology as New Relic’s error profiles, this tab compares the last five minutes to the prior hour by default (or whatever time windows you’ve selected with query editing) and surfaces any attributes that have significantly different distributions in the events being targeted by the selected signal. For example, if a custom attribute indicated that a recent throughput spike came from one user, that would surface highly in Profiles if most of the traffic usually comes from many users. Traces tab If the entity has distributed traces configured and available in the selected evaluated time window, the Traces section is enabled. Each card shows a summary of a trace and can be clicked for details. The Explore all traces links to the distributed traces application, filtered to the selected entity. Create a custom view To target signals and time windows beyond the default values, click the Change view button and select Custom view. To create your own view: Select the account or subaccount. Select the data type (metrics or events). Different functionality is available depending on the type. In View a chart with, select the metric or event you are interested in. Default is golden signals (throughput, response time, and errors). You can also build custom queries (filters) to target a signal that isn't on the list. In Facet by, select what the circles represent. Default is appName, but you can also choose host or any other facetable attribute available for the signal you’ve selected. If you plan to save/favorite this new view, provide a name in the Name your view box. Keep in mind that you can edit this view at any time using the pencil icon. The default time windows analyzed by New Relic Lookout are the last five minutes compared to the hour before. Use the time controls (View data from and Compare data to) to target other time windows. one.newrelic.com > Apps > New Relic Lookout: All event and metric data in the New Relic database can be queried using the Edit query feature. Click Analyze to begin analyzing the signal you’ve selected. You can also create your own query: Create your query. This query is comparing data from the past thirty minutes to data from the same range a day ago. Change from Basic to Advanced after clicking the Custom view button. Select the data type (metrics or events). Different functionality is available depending on the type. Enter your query using NRQL. Please note that not all NRQL features are available in the Lookout Advanced query feature. By default, the system will run this query using the last five minutes of data compared to the previous hour. Some examples of the syntax for changing the comparison and evaluation time windows are below. Click Analyze to begin analyzing the signal you’ve selected. Query: Compare the last 15 minutes to the same time 1 day ago Please note that the UNTIL NOW portion is required here unlike in standard NRQL. Without the UNTIL NOW added, the system will query a 5 minute slice of data starting 15 minutes ago SINCE 15 minutes AGO UNTIL NOW COMPARE WITH 1 day ago Copy Query: Compare a specific time range to the same range a month ago SINCE '2021-03-07 07:00:00-0500' UNTIL '2021-03-08 07:00:00-0500' COMPARE WITH 1 month ago Copy Or: SINCE 'today at midnight' UNTIL 'now' COMPARE WITH 1 MONTH AGO Copy Example: Unusual increases in error count The default view of New Relic Lookout shows application status across your estate, comparing the last five minutes to the hour before. Under regular operation, most large systems may have a handful of abnormalities, but usually most things will indicate normal behavior. Suddenly, several circles begin to change to red under the Errors section. This indicates that several applications are experiencing unusual increases in error count. It may be that one or two circles for important systems are red, and perhaps much larger than they usually appear. Clicking one of these can provide more information on what is happening. You might see that the error rate is substantially elevated, even thousands of percent higher than normal. To troubleshoot this issue, here's what you might discover in the New Relic Lookout tabs: Performance would show you data about other signals, illuminating the characteristics of the change in system dynamics. Correlations would surface other applications that are affected and how, as well as opportunities to pivot to other applications that may be closer to the underlying causes. Traces, in turn, would show distributed traces, which can provide specific examples of traffic running through those systems. Abnormal history would show other times in the past week with elevated errors, showing whether or not this problem happens regularly, such as every day at the same time or whenever there is a deployment. Profiles might show that all or most of the new errors share common properties, such as all being isolated to just one region/account/user. Combining the information from these sections, not only can you get a sense of what is going on, but also where to focus actions to resolve the problem.",

View and connect the performance of your entities Access the New Relic Explorer at one.newrelic.com and see together data reported by any entity from across all of your New Relic accounts. Entity categories include: Services: APM-monitored applications and services monitored. Hosts: your monitored infrastructure (your servers and hosts). Mobile applications: your mobile apps. Browser applications: your front-end browser apps. Integration-reported data: data from services monitored by our integrations, including our on-host integrations (like Kubernetes, StatsD, and NGINX), and cloud platform integrations, like Amazon, Microsoft Azure, and Google Cloud Platform (GCP). Workloads, your customized entity groupings. Containers, such as Kubernetes or Docker. Synthetic monitors, for simulations. Tip You can create new entity types to monitor any data source. Learn more about entity synthesis. Toggle between the Explorer's three views and the following features: one.newrelic.com > Explorer: Use the New Relic Explorer to locate and examine the entities you monitor. List. Browse and filter from a list of all the entities in your account. Use this landing interface to navigate, group, and filter your entities. New Relic Navigator.

Drill down and locate problematic entities easily with our improved search capabilities, and benefit from the AND and OR operators in one place. See everything. All the different entity types you have access to are listed in the collapsible sidebar on the left of the screen. This sidebar is interactive and used for exploratory purposes. It allows you to see only entities of the selected type, as it updates the filter from the filterbar. Create a new workload for meaningful groupings of your monitored entities. Add more data to instrument more elements of your system and achieve full stack observability. List view Your monitored entities are on the left, in a collapsable menu. You may need to scroll your list of entities to see them all. The list view also has a collapsable activity stream on the right side. You can see different useful events related to the first 25 alerting entities which are currently being filtered. Click on any entity for more details on its performance. The entity overview also incorporates the relationship between the selected entity and other entities in your system. New Relic Navigator The New Relic Navigator makes it easy to explore large numbers of entities as it intuitively displays the entire estate of your system in a highly dense honeycomb view with traffic light colors based on alerts. With the New Relic Navigator you can: Quickly explore the health of your environment at a glance. See all the entities that belong to all your accounts, and focus on specific entity types or specific groups of entities grouped by tags. Group and filter across all your entities to quickly zero in on issues. Click on any entity to see a mini-overview of its activity, metrics, and meta-data. New Relic Lookout New Relic Lookout provides an intuitive view of entities that are deviating from normal behavior, using circle visualization with color indicating severity and size conveying the scale of recent changes. You don’t need to configure anything: New Relic Lookout automatically compares performance within the last five minutes against the previous hour. Use New Relic Lookout to: Select the entity type to see golden signals of throughput, response time, and errors across all your accounts. Zoom in with correlations, abnormal history, traces, and the ability to leverage New Relic’s profiles across your estate. Click on an entity of interest to access the mini-overview component. Read more about New Relic Lookout. Tip You can modify the color palette to focus on clusters of interest. Understand the state of your system with the health (alert) status The New Relic Explorer shows a color-coded health status for entities. For example, you may see a red alert status indicating a critical violation in progress. To see what an alert status means, mouse over it. To see details about an entity's alerting status, select the entity. NRQL alert conditions aren't used to determine alert status because they aren't associated with specific entities. Important Starting June 8, 2020, New Relic One will not continue to display any APM application that hasn't reported data for 93 days. To match our published APM data retention guidelines, applications that have not reported data will be available within the New Relic UI for 90 days. After 90 days, those applications will be removed from the UI; however, key metrics will continue to be available via the New Relic REST API based on subscription level. For more information, see New Relic's Explorers Hub post. Filter entities using the filterbar The filterbar lets you select the entities displayed according to the conditions you enter: Type in a string of characters and/or numbers (for example, an environment) to find any entity that has this string in their name or ID. When typing, the UI suggests items that coincide with the string you're entering, so you can select one of those from the dropdown. You can also filter by the name of the entity, the entity type, account ID, environment, or a tag. Tip Selection parameters, once created, have a blue background. If you filter using a string, the filter will have the = operator. If you filter using the dropdown menu, once the first element of the searched item (tag key or attribute) is entered, you need to select an operator (=, !=, LIKE, NOT_LIKE, IN, NOT IN) for your filter. Once the operator is selected, complete the filter by selecting the value to complete the search item. To add more filters, first you have to select an operator, AND or OR. Use AND to indicate you want to restrict the selection removing entities from the list of results. You can also use the AND operator to add conditions that need to be met in the list of results, for example, entityType = Services AND location = APAC. Note that entityType = Services AND entityType = Hosts doesn’t return any results, as entities can only have one type and no entity would match this condition. Use OR to add more entities to the selection. For example, the filter entityType = Services OR entityType = Hosts returns every entity you have access to that is of type Services or Hosts. Entity data retention Availability of data depends on these factors: Scope Data retention New Relic Explorer and search In the UI, data is available for eight days after an entity no longer exists, with one exception: data reported by integrations, such as Amazon AWS, is only available for one day after an entity ceases to exist. Our database (accessible via NRQL query) For querying our database (for example, via the query builder or data explorer), availability is dependent on the data retention for that data type. As a result of these factors, a short-lived entity (like a cloud host) may not be available in the explorer list or via search, but its data may still be available via NRQL query.",

      "body": "In the software industry, a tag typically refers to a piece of metadata added to a data set for the purpose of improving data organization and findability. At New Relic, our tags are key:value pairs (like team: operations) added to various sets of data, like monitored apps and hosts, agents, dashboards, and workloads. We make some important attributes available as tags (for example, app metadata like app name and language, and host metadata like host name and AWS region). You can also add your own custom tags. You can use tags in the UI to filter down to relevant data. Here is an example: Here you can see an accountId tag being used to filter workloads to a specific account. Tags help you to: Organize data coming from a large number of sources and/or to a large number of New Relic accounts. Identify teams, roles, environments, or regions to know who’s responsible for what (see example use cases). Better organize and search dashboards and workloads. Query and chart APM data. Tags are useful for organizing data at a high level. If you want to add more fine-grained detail, like capturing user names or other high-cardinality values, custom attributes or custom events are a better solution. Tip Tags were previously called labels in the New Relic UI. You may sometimes see labelin our code; for example, some of our APM agent config files use a label config option for tags. Tag format and limits Format requirements and limits for tags: The UI has limits on the total number of tags it can display per entity: Limit of 100 for tags reported by default or added via agent/integration configuration. Limit of 100 for custom tags added via UI or API. The following are maximum character length for tags: Key: 128 characters Value: 256 characters Allowed characters: Characters must be UTF-8. When using NerdGraph to add tags, a dash (-) in a tag key is interpreted as a minus symbol. If your tag key has a dash, use back ticks around it (like `key-name`). Best practices and tips Before adding tags, we recommend first seeing how our default tags work for you. When you're ready to add your own tags, review the following best practices tips to get the most out of them. Tips on keeping tags simple: Start by adding only tags you know you’ll definitely use. Unused tags create noise and may add confusion. Try to use short tags. Shorter tags are easier to parse, and also the UI may sometimes truncate longer tags. (See character limits.) When possible, use keys and values that are human-readable (for example, region: EMEA is better than Param8323 : 1229072). Avoid including several values like regions: EMEA | US | LATAM in a single tag. We recommend using three different tags for that, like region: emea, region: us, and region: latam. If you want to match multiple tags, you can do that using the advanced options in the filter UI. Tips on using tags consistently: Try to be consistent with tag language across your teams and entities. Be consistent with naming. For example, avoid using both region: emea and reg: emea. Be consistent with format. For example, avoid using both camelCase and kebab-case. Although tag searching is not case-sensitive in the UI and API, try to be consistent with capitalization. For example, avoid using both env: staging and env: Staging. Tips on cross-team implementation: Tags help improve observability and cost allocation. For this reason, responsibility for tag implementation is often assigned to an observability team, SREs, a group of architects, or a cross-team task force. We recommend the people responsible for implementing tags meet and create an internal policy to describe how the tags are defined and which conventions are to be used. Then: Keep this reference manual up to date. Automate the definition of tags when you deploy New Relic agents, at the cloud provider, or through New Relic automation tools, such as the API or Terraform. Create recurring reports that identify entities that are non-compliant with your tagging standards. Tag examples Here are some examples of common ways to use tags to organize data: Team-related tags Creating tags for team names can be helpful to understand which team, group, department, or region was responsible for a change that led to a performance issue. Team examples: team: backend team: frontend team: db Role examples: roles: architecture roles: devops roles: pm Region examples: region: emea region: america region: asia Environment-related tags You can create entities for the environment they belong to. Examples: env: production env: qa env: development env: staging Criticality-related tags You can create tags related to criticality levels, which lets you easier track the most critical issues. Examples: layer: level1 layer: level2 layer: level3 How tags are added Some important attributes, by default, are available for use as tags. For example, the account name, the account ID, and some basic host/server metadata are available as default tags. You can't remove these available-by-default tags. Here are some details about how tags are added for some specific data sources: Add tags via UI or API When you add tags via the UI or API, this occurs at the entity level. This means that, for example, if you have multiple APM agents monitoring a single entity and apply a tag via the UI, that tag is available for all data coming from that entity. To add or delete tags via the UI: Select a monitored entity, like a monitored app or host. Near the entity’s name at the top of the page, select the See metadata and manage tags menu. In the menu that pops up, add or delete a tag. For APM agents, restart your service. To manage tags via API: see our NerdGraph tagging docs. For a guide to using our CLI to automate tagging, see our developer site. APM agent tags You can add tags via the UI and API or you can add tags using APM agent configuration, both methods require you to restart your service. There are differences in how these apply tags: Via agent config: These tags are applied at the agent-level, not the entity/application level. This would be a good option if you have multiple agents monitoring different aspects of the same app (for example, a blue-green deployment model). Via the UI or API: These tags are applied at the entity/application level. Here are links to the agent configuration options: C SDK: not available Java Go .NET Node.js PHP Python Ruby For information on querying APM tags, see Query APM tags. And check out this short video on querying APM tags (3:20 minutes). Infrastructure data tags There are several ways tags are added to infrastructure entities and services: Use the UI or API to add tags at the entity level. Infrastructure agent: some attributes are available by default as tags. You can also add custom attributes, which are also available as tags in the UI. On-host integrations: some attributes are available by default as tags. You can also add tags by using integration-specific labels config options (for an example, see the labels config for the Apache integration). Cloud service integrations: by default we report tags and labels that are defined in the cloud service. To add tags, you'd add them on the cloud-service-side. Automate tags with our CLI For a guide to automating tags using our CLI tool, see our developer site. Use tags to filter the UI Use the filter field at the top of the New Relic Explorer to filter down to the entities you care about. You can use multiple filter conditions. To filter down to certain entities using tags: From one.newrelic.com, click Explorer. Click the Filter by... field to see a dropdown of available attributes and tags. You can filter by multiple elements and use advanced search options. To find an entity’s metadata and tags from the UI, here are two options: From a list of entities in the UI, at the far right, select an entity's icon. OR Select an entity. Near the top of the page, select the icon. To use the API to view tags, see our NerdGraph docs. Learn about how to use tags with dashboards and how to use tags with workloads. Custom queries, charts, and alerts Different features handle tags differently. Here are some details about how you can use NRQL to query tag data, or create NRQL condition alerts. Query and alert on APM tags You can query APM tags using NRQL. Minimum agent versions: C: not available Go: 2.3.0 Java: 4.9.0 .NET: 8.17 Node: v4.13.0 PHP: not available Python: v4.10.0.112 Ruby: 6.1.0.352 Here are some query examples: Throughput across shards Given a service that is distributed across nine shards, each shard assigned as an environment, we can plot the transaction throughput on all shards using a wildcard query like: SELECT rate(count(apm.service.transaction.duration), 1 minute) FROM Metric WHERE appName LIKE 'MyApp (%' AND transactionType = 'Other' FACET tags.Environment TIMESERIES Copy Transactions per team To see the number of transactions per service for a specific team, we might use a query like: FROM Transaction SELECT count(*) WHERE tags.Team = 'team-a' FACET tags.Project TIMESERIES Copy Alert on error rate for teams You can use a query for your services’ error rate for setting an alert without having to create a rule for each service. Here is the error rate for all services on a team called team-b. And this alert will automatically monitor any new app names added with the team tag. FROM Metric SELECT count(apm.service.error.count) / count(apm.service.transaction.duration) WHERE tags.Team = 'team-b' FACET appName Copy Related to this, you might create a general rule for a specific service deployed across several environments, so that we have an alarm for a single service monitoring each environment individually: From Metric SELECT count(apm.service.error.count) / count(apm.service.transaction.duration) WHERE tags.Project = 'MyProject' FACET tags.Environment Copy Query and alert on attributes As explained in the tag sources information, some important attributes are used as tags. You can query all attributes and create custom charts using NRQL, and create NRQL alert conditions.",

Launch into other areas of New Relic One for deeper understanding Requirements New Relic Lookout requires Pro or Enterprise edition. If you are on Standard edition, you can still use the New Relic Lookout view in the New Relic Explorer. If you want to see data spanning 13-months, correlations, profiles, traces, and other details, you must upgrade to a higher edition. Get started with New Relic Lookout To access New Relic Lookout, click the Apps button in New Relic One and locate the New Relic Lookout launcher. You can also access New Relic Lookout directly from the New Relic One header bar, via the More dropdown. Enablement of key service performance indicator data is required for New Relic Lookout to provide value from the data you already have. The default view provides insight into three key Service performance indicators broken down by application: throughput, response time, and errors. These metrics are analyzed to show how the data has behaved during the last five minutes compared to the prior hour. one.newrelic.com > Apps > New Relic Lookout: Anything that significantly deviates from the trend is automatically discovered by New Relic Lookout, which doesn't require any configuration. Circle visualization and table view Each application (or other facet) is represented by a circle. The size of the circles indicate the magnitude of the signal for that application and the color indicates whether the value has significantly decreased or increased in the last five minutes, based on the standard deviation of the prior hour (default evaluation and comparison time windows.) Please note that the type of signal is important when interpreting your results. When you first look at the legend below, you might be tempted to interpret yellow as good and dark purple as bad, but that is not always the case. Here are some examples: In the APM/services golden signals, a dark yellow circle in Throughput might signify that something bad has occurred and led to a drop in traffic. At the same time, a dark purple circle might also be concerning due to unexpected load. Both are significant findings worth exploring. In browser golden signals, a dark purple circle in Page Views might be great, as you are seeing more traffic to your site! With errors golden signals (in all entity types), a large circle, even if gray (not deviating from normal volume), is worth exploring because a high count of errors in your system is important to investigate. The legend allows you to change the colors used to highlight deviating services To change the color palette, click the gear icon by the low-high color legend. This allows you to change the colors used to highlight deviating services. To get a table view of the same data, click the toggle on the right. You can also hover over each color to filter the view by degree lower or higher deviance. Abnormal golden signals On the right, New Relic Lookout displays the most significantly deviating applications (or other facet) in a side panel, weighted by both the magnitude of the performance indicators and the scale of their deviations. Details include the name of the key performance indicator, their magnitude during the recent time window, and the difference between the averages from one time compared to the other. Instant search Click the magnifying glass icon in the side panel to open a search box. Typing into the search box filters the circles, table, and abnormal signals to applications (or other facets) that contain the text. This is a good way to quickly zoom to various subsystems. New Relic Lookout doesn't rerun the analysis when using the instant search. Change view Click the Change View button on the right side panel. The panel that appears shows you all the entity-specific golden signals you can toggle between out of the box. By choosing the Browser Golden Signal or other views, you can change from the default view. Each new view will have the golden signals appropriate for that entity type. Drill down into the details To analyze an application or facet, click a circle, table row, or abnormal golden signal. The details panel shows the degree of deviation of the performance indicator, a link to the affected entity, and recent alert and deployment activity for that entity, when available. There’s also an indication of whether the selected evaluation time period would be abnormal or not in reference to other comparison time windows, such as the same time yesterday or the same time last week. This allows you to quickly see if the abnormal behavior is odd in general, or just based on the comparison time window. Performance tab The default tab shows charts for other key performance indicators for the selected application or facet. The charts compare the two time windows being analyzed. You can click their titles to rerun the analysis, focusing on the selected key performance indicator. When the target is a New Relic One application, we show the top transactions, error classes, external services, and database operations, alongside links to the relevant New Relic One features. Abnormal History tab This section analyzes past performance of the selected signal and calls out any time periods with notable abnormalities. Each card represents an abnormal time window and can be clicked for more details. The charts will display any relevant violations and deployments in New Relic. Correlations tab New Relic Lookout can find other signals that began behaving differently around the same time as the selected signal for that entity type. Clicking the name of the signal reruns the analysis, focusing on that key performance indicator. The chart titles link to New Relic One when there’s an associated entity in your account. Note that correlations currently do not analyze across accounts. The correlated signals displayed are for others in the account of the original application you are viewing. This helps focus the data on correlations that are more likely related to your issue. Profile tab Based on the same technology as New Relic’s error profiles, this tab compares the last five minutes to the prior hour by default (or whatever time windows you’ve selected with query editing) and surfaces any attributes that have significantly different distributions in the events being targeted by the selected signal. For example, if a custom attribute indicated that a recent throughput spike came from one user, that would surface highly in Profiles if most of the traffic usually comes from many users. Traces tab If the entity has distributed traces configured and available in the selected evaluated time window, the Traces section is enabled. Each card shows a summary of a trace and can be clicked for details. The Explore all traces links to the distributed traces application, filtered to the selected entity. Create a custom view To target signals and time windows beyond the default values, click the Change view button and select Custom view. To create your own view: Select the account or subaccount. Select the data type (metrics or events). Different functionality is available depending on the type. In View a chart with, select the metric or event you are interested in. Default is golden signals (throughput, response time, and errors). You can also build custom queries (filters) to target a signal that isn't on the list. In Facet by, select what the circles represent. Default is appName, but you can also choose host or any other facetable attribute available for the signal you’ve selected. If you plan to save/favorite this new view, provide a name in the Name your view box. Keep in mind that you can edit this view at any time using the pencil icon. The default time windows analyzed by New Relic Lookout are the last five minutes compared to the hour before. Use the time controls (View data from and Compare data to) to target other time windows. one.newrelic.com > Apps > New Relic Lookout: All event and metric data in the New Relic database can be queried using the Edit query feature. Click Analyze to begin analyzing the signal you’ve selected. You can also create your own query: Create your query. This query is comparing data from the past thirty minutes to data from the same range a day ago. Change from Basic to Advanced after clicking the Custom view button. Select the data type (metrics or events). Different functionality is available depending on the type. Enter your query using NRQL. Please note that not all NRQL features are available in the Lookout Advanced query feature. By default, the system will run this query using the last five minutes of data compared to the previous hour. Some examples of the syntax for changing the comparison and evaluation time windows are below. Click Analyze to begin analyzing the signal you’ve selected. Query: Compare the last 15 minutes to the same time 1 day ago Please note that the UNTIL NOW portion is required here unlike in standard NRQL. Without the UNTIL NOW added, the system will query a 5 minute slice of data starting 15 minutes ago SINCE 15 minutes AGO UNTIL NOW COMPARE WITH 1 day ago Copy Query: Compare a specific time range to the same range a month ago SINCE '2021-03-07 07:00:00-0500' UNTIL '2021-03-08 07:00:00-0500' COMPARE WITH 1 month ago Copy Or: SINCE 'today at midnight' UNTIL 'now' COMPARE WITH 1 MONTH AGO Copy Example: Unusual increases in error count The default view of New Relic Lookout shows application status across your estate, comparing the last five minutes to the hour before. Under regular operation, most large systems may have a handful of abnormalities, but usually most things will indicate normal behavior. Suddenly, several circles begin to change to red under the Errors section. This indicates that several applications are experiencing unusual increases in error count. It may be that one or two circles for important systems are red, and perhaps much larger than they usually appear. Clicking one of these can provide more information on what is happening. You might see that the error rate is substantially elevated, even thousands of percent higher than normal. To troubleshoot this issue, here's what you might discover in the New Relic Lookout tabs: Performance would show you data about other signals, illuminating the characteristics of the change in system dynamics. Correlations would surface other applications that are affected and how, as well as opportunities to pivot to other applications that may be closer to the underlying causes. Traces, in turn, would show distributed traces, which can provide specific examples of traffic running through those systems. Abnormal history would show other times in the past week with elevated errors, showing whether or not this problem happens regularly, such as every day at the same time or whenever there is a deployment. Profiles might show that all or most of the new errors share common properties, such as all being isolated to just one region/account/user. Combining the information from these sections, not only can you get a sense of what is going on, but also where to focus actions to resolve the problem.",

Zoom in with correlations, abnormal history, traces, and the ability to leverage New Relic’s profiles across your estate. Click on an entity of interest to access the mini-overview component. Read more about New Relic Lookout. Tip You can modify the color palette to focus on clusters of interest. Understand the state of your system with the health (alert) status The New Relic Explorer shows a color-coded health status for entities. For example, you may see a red alert status indicating a critical violation in progress. To see what an alert status means, mouse over it. To see details about an entity's alerting status, select the entity. NRQL alert conditions aren't used to determine alert status because they aren't associated with specific entities. Important Starting June 8, 2020, New Relic One will not continue to display any APM application that hasn't reported data for 93 days. To match our published APM data retention guidelines, applications that have not reported data will be available within the New Relic UI for 90 days. After 90 days, those applications will be removed from the UI; however, key metrics will continue to be available via the New Relic REST API based on subscription level. For more information, see New Relic's Explorers Hub post. Filter entities using the filterbar The filterbar lets you select the entities displayed according to the conditions you enter: Type in a string of characters and/or numbers (for example, an environment) to find any entity that has this string in their name or ID. When typing, the UI suggests items that coincide with the string you're entering, so you can select one of those from the dropdown. You can also filter by the name of the entity, the entity type, account ID, environment, or a tag. Tip Selection parameters, once created, have a blue background. If you filter using a string, the filter will have the = operator. If you filter using the dropdown menu, once the first element of the searched item (tag key or attribute) is entered, you need to select an operator (=, !=, LIKE, NOT_LIKE, IN, NOT IN) for your filter. Once the operator is selected, complete the filter by selecting the value to complete the search item. To add more filters, first you have to select an operator, AND or OR. Use AND to indicate you want to restrict the selection removing entities from the list of results. You can also use the AND operator to add conditions that need to be met in the list of results, for example, entityType = Services AND location = APAC. Note that entityType = Services AND entityType = Hosts doesn’t return any results, as entities can only have one type and no entity would match this condition. Use OR to add more entities to the selection. For example, the filter entityType = Services OR entityType = Hosts returns every entity you have access to that is of type Services or Hosts. Entity data retention Availability of data depends on these factors: Scope Data retention New Relic Explorer and search In the UI, data is available for eight days after an entity no longer exists, with one exception: data reported by integrations, such as Amazon AWS, is only available for one day after an entity ceases to exist. Our database (accessible via NRQL query) For querying our database (for example, via the query builder or data explorer), availability is dependent on the data retention for that data type. As a result of these factors, a short-lived entity (like a cloud host) may not be available in the explorer list or via search, but its data may still be available via NRQL query.",

      "body": "This list is current. Networks, IPs, domains, ports, and endpoints last updated September 28, 2021. This is a list of the networks, IP addresses, domains, ports, and endpoints used by API clients or agents to communicate with New Relic. TLS is required for all domains. For information on our FedRAMP endpoints, see our FedRAMP endpoints documentation. Tip This doc describes how to ensure our agents and integrations can access New Relic's domains. To monitor the performance of your network, see Get started with Network Performance Monitoring. TLS encryption To ensure data security for our customers and to be in compliance with FedRAMP and other standards for data encryption, Transport Layer Security (TLS) is required for all domains. Our preferred protocol for all domains is TLS 1.2. For more information, see New Relic's Explorers Hub post about TLS 1.2. In addition, TLS 1.2 is required for most domains, except: APM agent connections Browser agent connections Event API For future updates to required and supported protocol versions, follow the Security Notifications tag in New Relic's Explorers Hub. User-facing domains Your browser must be able to communicate with a number of domains for New Relic One to work properly. Update your allow list to ensure New Relic can communicate with a number of integral domains that are listed in this section. Blocking domains can cause issues with individual product features or prevent pages from loading altogether. This list doesn't cover domains that New Relic connects to that can be blocked without affecting your usage of the product. It also doesn't cover Nerdpacks or other features that communicate with external services that have additional domain requirements. If your organization uses a firewall that restricts outbound traffic, follow the specific procedures for the operating system and the firewall you use to add the following domains to the allow list. Domain Description *.newrelic.com New Relic One and supporting services *.nr-assets.net Static New Relic assets *.nr-ext.net New Relic One Nerdpacks and assets *.amazonaws.com New Relic One catalog assets behind AWS S3 *.cloudfront.net Static New Relic assets behind AWS CloudFront CDN secure.gravatar.com Support for Gravatar avatars fonts.googleapis.com Support for Google Fonts fonts.gstatic.com Support for Google Fonts www.google.com Support for reCAPTCHA www.gstatic.com Support for reCAPTCHA *.nr-data.net OpenTelemetry and Pixie APM agents To enhance network performance and data security, New Relic uses a CDN and DDoS prevention service with a large IP range. New Relic agents require your firewall to allow outgoing connections to the following networks and ports. To add the following IP connections to the allow list, follow the specific procedures for the operating system and the firewall you use. TLS is required for all domains. Use the IP connections for account data in the US or European Union region as appropriate: IP connections APM data Networks US region accounts: 162.247.240.0/22 EU region accounts: 185.221.84.0/22 Ports US region accounts: Default: TCP 443 (recommended) TCP 80 EU region accounts: Default: TCP 443 (recommended) TCP 80 Endpoints US region accounts: collector*.newrelic.com EU region accounts: collector*.eu01.nr-data.net:443 (recommended) Port 443 recommended Recommendation: Use port 443, a secured channel for encrypted HTTPS traffic. Some New Relic agents also offer port 80, an unsecured channel open to all HTTP traffic. While some agents can be configured to use both port 80 and port 443, we recommend that you choose the port 443 (default). If you have an existing configuration that uses port 80, you can update it to use port 443, the default New Relic connection. Agent downloads TLS is required for all domains. Service for download.newrelic.com is provided through Fastly and is subject to change without warning. For the most current list of public IP addresses for New Relic agent downloads, see api.fastly.com/public-ip-list. Infrastructure agents In order to report data to New Relic, our infrastructure monitoring needs outbound access to these domains, networks, and ports. TLS is required for all domains. Use the IP connections for account data in the US or European Union region as appropriate: IP connections Infrastructure data Domains infra-api.newrelic.com: Required to submit events, metrics, and inventory data. identity-api.newrelic.com: Required for entity registration (for example, a host entity). infrastructure-command-api.newrelic.com: Required to determine feature flags. Also used for gradual rollout of new capabilities. log-api.newrelic.com: Required to submit logs to a US datacenter. log-api.eu.newrelic.com: Required to submit logs to an EU datacenter. metric-api.newrelic.com: Required to submit dimensional metrics.

Browser domains In addition to the IP addresses for APM agents, applications monitored by our browser agents use outgoing connections to the following domains. TLS is required for all domains. Use the IP connections for account data in the US or European Union region as appropriate: For US region accounts: bam.nr-data.net js-agent.newrelic.com For EU region accounts: eu01.nr-data.net bam.eu01.nr-data.net For more information about CDN access for the js-agent.newrelic.com file to the domain bam.nr-data.net or to one of the New Relic beacons, see Security for browser monitoring. Mobile domains In addition to the IP addresses for APM agents, applications monitored by our mobile agents use outgoing connections to the following domains. TLS is required for all domains. Use the IP connections for account data in the US or European Union region as appropriate: For US region accounts: mobile-collector.newrelic.com mobile-crash.newrelic.com mobile-symbol-upload.newrelic.com For EU region accounts: mobile-collector.eu01.nr-data.net mobile-crash.eu01.nr-data.net mobile-symbol-upload.eu01.nr-data.net Synthetic monitor public locations To configure your firewall to allow synthetic monitors to access your monitored URL, use Synthetic public minion IPs. TLS is required for all domains. Synthetic monitor private locations Synthetic private minions report to a specific endpoint based on region. To allow the private minion to access the endpoint or the static IP addresses associated with the endpoint, follow the specific procedures for the operating system and the firewall you use. These IP addresses may change in the future. TLS is required for all domains. Use the IP connections for account data in the US or European Union region as appropriate: IP connections Synthetics private location data Endpoint For US region accounts: https://synthetics-horde.nr-data.net/ For EU region accounts: https://synthetics-horde.eu01.nr-data.net/ IP addresses For US region accounts: 13.248.153.51 76.223.21.185 For EU region accounts: 185.221.86.57 185.221.86.25 Alerts webhooks, api.newrelic.com, cloud integrations, and ticketing integrations Endpoints that use api.newrelic.com (such as our GraphQL API for NerdGraph) and our New Relic-generated webhooks for alert policies use an IP address from designated network blocks for the US or European Union region.

      "body": "This list is current. Networks, IPs, domains, ports, and endpoints last updated September 28, 2021. This is a list of the networks, IP addresses, domains, ports, and endpoints used by API clients or agents to communicate with New Relic. TLS is required for all domains. For information on our FedRAMP endpoints, see our FedRAMP endpoints documentation. Tip This doc describes how to ensure our agents and integrations can access New Relic's domains. To monitor the performance of your network, see Get started with Network Performance Monitoring. TLS encryption To ensure data security for our customers and to be in compliance with FedRAMP and other standards for data encryption, Transport Layer Security (TLS) is required for all domains. Our preferred protocol for all domains is TLS 1.2. For more information, see New Relic's Explorers Hub post about TLS 1.2. In addition, TLS 1.2 is required for most domains, except: APM agent connections Browser agent connections Event API For future updates to required and supported protocol versions, follow the Security Notifications tag in New Relic's Explorers Hub. User-facing domains Your browser must be able to communicate with a number of domains for New Relic One to work properly. Update your allow list to ensure New Relic can communicate with a number of integral domains that are listed in this section. Blocking domains can cause issues with individual product features or prevent pages from loading altogether. This list doesn't cover domains that New Relic connects to that can be blocked without affecting your usage of the product. It also doesn't cover Nerdpacks or other features that communicate with external services that have additional domain requirements. If your organization uses a firewall that restricts outbound traffic, follow the specific procedures for the operating system and the firewall you use to add the following domains to the allow list. Domain Description *.newrelic.com New Relic One and supporting services *.nr-assets.net Static New Relic assets *.nr-ext.net New Relic One Nerdpacks and assets *.amazonaws.com New Relic One catalog assets behind AWS S3 *.cloudfront.net Static New Relic assets behind AWS CloudFront CDN secure.gravatar.com Support for Gravatar avatars fonts.googleapis.com Support for Google Fonts fonts.gstatic.com Support for Google Fonts www.google.com Support for reCAPTCHA www.gstatic.com Support for reCAPTCHA *.nr-data.net OpenTelemetry and Pixie APM agents To enhance network performance and data security, New Relic uses a CDN and DDoS prevention service with a large IP range. New Relic agents require your firewall to allow outgoing connections to the following networks and ports. To add the following IP connections to the allow list, follow the specific procedures for the operating system and the firewall you use. TLS is required for all domains. Use the IP connections for account data in the US or European Union region as appropriate: IP connections APM data Networks US region accounts: 162.247.240.0/22 EU region accounts: 185.221.84.0/22 Ports US region accounts: Default: TCP 443 (recommended) TCP 80 EU region accounts: Default: TCP 443 (recommended) TCP 80 Endpoints US region accounts: collector*.newrelic.com EU region accounts: collector*.eu01.nr-data.net:443 (recommended) Port 443 recommended Recommendation: Use port 443, a secured channel for encrypted HTTPS traffic. Some New Relic agents also offer port 80, an unsecured channel open to all HTTP traffic. While some agents can be configured to use both port 80 and port 443, we recommend that you choose the port 443 (default). If you have an existing configuration that uses port 80, you can update it to use port 443, the default New Relic connection. Agent downloads TLS is required for all domains. Service for download.newrelic.com is provided through Fastly and is subject to change without warning. For the most current list of public IP addresses for New Relic agent downloads, see api.fastly.com/public-ip-list. Infrastructure agents In order to report data to New Relic, our infrastructure monitoring needs outbound access to these domains, networks, and ports. TLS is required for all domains. Use the IP connections for account data in the US or European Union region as appropriate: IP connections Infrastructure data Domains infra-api.newrelic.com: Required to submit events, metrics, and inventory data. identity-api.newrelic.com: Required for entity registration (for example, a host entity). infrastructure-command-api.newrelic.com: Required to determine feature flags. Also used for gradual rollout of new capabilities. log-api.newrelic.com: Required to submit logs to a US datacenter. log-api.eu.newrelic.com: Required to submit logs to an EU datacenter. metric-api.newrelic.com: Required to submit dimensional metrics. Networks For US region accounts: 162.247.240.0/22 For EU region accounts: 185.221.84.0/22 Port 443 Domains + Port For US region accounts: infra-api.newrelic.com:443 identity-api.newrelic.com:443 infrastructure-command-api.newrelic.com:443 log-api.newrelic.com:443 metric-api.newrelic.com:443 For EU region accounts: infra-api.eu.newrelic.com:443 identity-api.eu.newrelic.com:443 infrastructure-command-api.eu.newrelic.com:443 log-api.eu.newrelic.com:443 metric-api.eu.newrelic.com:443 Proxy If your system needs a proxy to connect to this domain, use the Infrastructure proxy setting. Browser domains In addition to the IP addresses for APM agents, applications monitored by our browser agents use outgoing connections to the following domains. TLS is required for all domains. Use the IP connections for account data in the US or European Union region as appropriate: For US region accounts: bam.nr-data.net js-agent.newrelic.com For EU region accounts: eu01.nr-data.net bam.eu01.nr-data.net For more information about CDN access for the js-agent.newrelic.com file to the domain bam.nr-data.net or to one of the New Relic beacons, see Security for browser monitoring. Mobile domains In addition to the IP addresses for APM agents, applications monitored by our mobile agents use outgoing connections to the following domains. TLS is required for all domains. Use the IP connections for account data in the US or European Union region as appropriate: For US region accounts: mobile-collector.newrelic.com mobile-crash.newrelic.com mobile-symbol-upload.newrelic.com For EU region accounts: mobile-collector.eu01.nr-data.net mobile-crash.eu01.nr-data.net mobile-symbol-upload.eu01.nr-data.net Synthetic monitor public locations To configure your firewall to allow synthetic monitors to access your monitored URL, use Synthetic public minion IPs. TLS is required for all domains. Synthetic monitor private locations Synthetic private minions report to a specific endpoint based on region. To allow the private minion to access the endpoint or the static IP addresses associated with the endpoint, follow the specific procedures for the operating system and the firewall you use. These IP addresses may change in the future. TLS is required for all domains. Use the IP connections for account data in the US or European Union region as appropriate: IP connections Synthetics private location data Endpoint For US region accounts: https://synthetics-horde.nr-data.net/ For EU region accounts: https://synthetics-horde.eu01.nr-data.net/ IP addresses For US region accounts: 13.248.153.51 76.223.21.185 For EU region accounts: 185.221.86.57 185.221.86.25 Alerts webhooks, api.newrelic.com, cloud integrations, and ticketing integrations Endpoints that use api.newrelic.com (such as our GraphQL API for NerdGraph) and our New Relic-generated webhooks for alert policies use an IP address from designated network blocks for the US or European Union region. TLS is required for all addresses in these blocks. Network blocks for US region accounts: 162.247.240.0/22 Network blocks for EU region accounts: 158.177.65.64/29 159.122.103.184/29 161.156.125.32/28 These network blocks also apply to third-party ticketing integrations and New Relic cloud integrations. Pixie integration The Pixie integration runs in your Kubernetes cluster and pulls a set of curated observability data from Pixie to send it to New Relic using the OpenTelemetry line protocol. The Pixie integration requires outbound network access to the following: work.withpixie.ai:443 otlp.nr-data.net:4317 (US region accounts) otlp.eu01.nr-data.net:4317 (EU region accounts) OpenTelemetry New Relic supports the native OpenTelemetry Protocol (OTLP) for exporting telemetry data. This allows you to use the vendor neutral components developed by the OpenTelemetry community to export your data to New Relic. To export OTLP data to New Relic, configure the OTLP exporter to add a header ( api-key ) whose value is your account license key. And, based on your region, configure the endpoint where the exporter sends data to New Relic. See the OpenTelemetry quick start for more information. otlp.nr-data.net:4317 (US region accounts) otlp.eu01.nr-data.net:4317 (EU region accounts) Network blocks for US region accounts: 162.247.240.0/22 Network blocks for EU region accounts: 185.221.84.0/22",

      "body": "At New Relic, we support our customers by continually improving our Software as a Service (SaaS) features and distributed software. Sometimes that means we introduce changes that can include moving away from existing software components and features, called end-of-life (EOL). As we make these decisions, we strive to balance the need to introduce improvements with our customer’s tolerance for change. We do our best to anticipate the impact of these changes for our customers. What we communicate We're committed to communicating about the changes that impact user experience, especially when these changes have a significant effect on workflow. In assessing impact we evaluate: Potential impact to customer workflow Feature usage information Customer feedback In communicating changes, we strive to: Give as much lead time as possible Minimize interruption Provide a documented alternative Lead time for notifications EOL changes are classified into the following categories: Transition impact Description Notification lead time Low Limited changes to customer processes or procedures are anticipated. None to 90 days Moderate Changes to functionality are limited in scope. Actions such as upgrading retired agents to supported versions may be required. Minimum of 90 days High Changes are highly impactful to customers and will require significant investment from customers to adapt. Minimum of 180 days Critical A third party dependency, security issue, or other critical risk causes an urgent need to change or remove functionality on an accelerated timeline. Notified as soon as reasonably practical EOL lead times: impact on distributed software Subject to EOL lead times: Our lead time notifications also apply to distributed software, which is software developed by New Relic that is installed on customer-owned systems. Distributed software is not cloud-based, and has a lifespan from the date of each released version. After that date, it may cease to function or stop reporting data to New Relic. We have fully open sourced many of our distributed software projects as community projects. We also participate in many community-led software development projects. If we have not open sourced our software projects, or if we have designated them as Community Plus projects, the following timeframes apply to them: Released on or after October 1, 2020: These projects will be compatible with our SaaS offering for at least two years after the date of publishing the release. Released prior to October 1, 2020: These projects will be compatible for at least three years after the date of publishing the release. All fixes and security updates are provided in the latest released version of distributed software, and we encourage our customers to keep installed software up to date. In the event a released version of software will cease normal function sooner than two (or three) years, New Relic will follow the EOL process. EOL lead times not applicable: Some of our distributed software have been open sourced, are designated as such, and are available at github.com/newrelic, including: Community projects New Relic One catalog Example code New Relic experimental Archived Our EOL policy does not apply to these projects, which is why we do not provide advance EOL notification for them. However, you can still find information and support for selected projects through: New Relic's documentation at docs.newrelic.com Project repos at github.com/newrelic Questions about EOL notifications?

      "body": "BETA FEATURE This feature is currently in beta. What permissions do I need to use New Relic's Service Levels? To use New Relic's Service Levels and see SLO results, you need a full platform user. However, in order to create new SLIs and SLOs, you need the specific capability in your role to modify events to metric rules. If you get the following errors, check your user permissions: The UI has disabled the option to save an SLI/SLO. The API returns the error message “Cannot query field \\\"eventExportRegisterRule\\\" on type \\\"RootMutationType\\\".”. How do I get support from New Relic during the public beta? Service Levels Management is in public beta, and no official support is offered yet through the Support portal. If you have general questions and feedback, please post them on the Explorers Hub. New Relic’s community and the product team will be glad to help you there. If you have suggestions about documentation, please suggest an improvement or send your contribution using the Create issue or Edit page buttons on the top right corner in the docs UI. Why don’t I see any data right after I create an SLI? New Relic starts generating new SLI metrics from the moment that you create an SLI. This is why we need a few minutes before we can start showing the first meaningful SLI attainment results. The benefit of the new data is that it has 13 month retention by default, and it’s more efficient to query for long periods of time. Can I configure an SLI on any entity type? Yes, you can configure an SLI on any entity type, such as an APM service, a browser application, or a Lambda function. SLI queries support NRDB events. Support for dimensional metrics on SLI queries is on our roadmap. Can I get alerts on SLI data? Alerts on New Relic's Service Levels are on our roadmap. How does New Relic calculate the remaining error budget? The remaining error budget indicates what percentage of requests could still have a bad response over the SLO period without compromising the objective. Therefore, the total amount of tolerated bad responses will vary with the throughput of requests. Time-based error budgets are on our roadmap. How can I view the queries that define an SLI from the UI? To view the queries that define an SLI, you can click on the ... menu on the SLI summary card, then select the Edit option. The queries will show at the top-right corner. How can I view the queries that define an SLI through the API? To view the queries that define an SLI through the API, use Nerdgraph. In order to view the SLI configuration, you'll need to know the GUID of the entity the SLI is attached to, and replace it in the following query: { actor { entity(guid: \"{entityGuid}\") { serviceLevel { indicators { events { badEvents { where from } goodEvents { from where } validEvents { from where } } name } } } } } Copy As a response you are going to receive all the SLIs attached to the entity, the SLI name, and the queries. Keep in mind that either goodEvents or badEvents is going to have content, depending on the configuration of the SLI. Can I chart the SLI attainment on a dashboard? You can chart SLI attainment time series on your custom dashboards using the following query: FROM Metric SELECT clamp_max((count(newrelic.sli.valid) - count(newrelic.sli.bad)) / count(newrelic.sli.valid) * 100, 100) as 'SLI attainment' WHERE sli.id = '<sli.id>' UNTIL 2 MINUTES AGO TIMESERIES AUTO Copy Where sli.id is the SLI identifier. The easiest way to add a chart like this to your dashboard is by using the Add to dashboard option, available on the Details view. Alternatively, you can find the SLI id and SLI attainment query through the Nerdgraph API with the following query: { actor { entity(guid: \"{entityGuid}\") { serviceLevel { indicators { name id resultQueries { indicator { nrql } } } } } } } Copy Use the entityGuid of the entity that's associated with the SLI. On the query results, you’ll get the SLI id in the serviceLevel.indicators.id field.",

      "body": "BETA FEATURE This feature is currently in beta. With New Relic you can define and consume service level indicators and service level objectives for your applications. What are SLIs and SLOs? Service Levels are used to measure the performance of a service from the end user (or client application) point of view. For instance, a Service Level can represent whether a video loaded quickly enough, or whether a directions service returned at least one possible route between two points. Service level indicators (SLIs) are accurate quantitative measures of the user experience as described by a service level. They represent a proportion of successful outputs, and therefore they’re expressed as a percentage (%). For example, an SLI can measure the proportion of requests that were faster than some threshold, or the proportion of records coming into a pipeline that resulted in the correct value coming out. And while users understand that a video might take a few additional seconds to load, or that an application might return an error from time to time, this shouldn’t happen often if you don’t want to lose their trust. Therefore, once you’ve defined SLIs for the performance aspects that are most relevant for the end users of your services, you need to set SLOs to track that the service is meeting their expectations. Service level objectives (SLOs) are defined as a target value that an SLI must meet over a period of time. For example, videos must start playing in less than 2 seconds 99% of the time over a week period. Please refer to the Service Level management use case implementation guide to learn more about identifying service boundaries and deploying the instrumentation that your service levels will be based on. Service Levels and APM SLA reports New Relic has provided automatic SLA Reports for APM Services for a long time. The Apdex-based reports, which you can get on your email inbox on Mondays, are automatically generated for services that produce web transactions, and are useful to see trends over time. On top of the SLAs, our new SLM level capability is better aligned with modern service level best practices, such as those promoted by the Google SRE Handbook, and provides new, improved functionality: SLIs can be defined on any NRDB event that is reported to New Relic, not just APM transactions. Therefore you can also base SLIs on your own custom events. You can decide which service boundaries and which metrics are relevant for your service levels, and you can set your own objectives. You can view SLO results across your accounts, and within your workloads. What's next? Ready to get started? If you don't already have one, sign up for a free New Relic account. You can find Service Levels in several places in New Relic One: At the top nav bar, under the More menu (which you can customize). At the previews of those entities that have an SLI defined. In APM services, at the reports section. Within a workload, at the Service Levels tab. Carry on and read our docs on how to create and consume SLIs and SLOs. You can also check out how to manage SLMs with our API.",

As a full platform user you get access to our entire set of observability tools. All our tools are interconnected and accessible in New Relic One. All the data you bring to New Relic through agents and integrations are metrics, events, logs, and traces that feed our platform's analytics and monitoring capabilities. New Relic links your data in a meaningful way so that you can explore it, build dashboards, and set up alerts. Our out-of-the-box observability UI experiences allow to visualize, analyze, and troubleshoot your entire software stack in one unified platform. The New Relic Explorer consolidates all the entities in your system, and how they're connected, in a single place, so you can easily detect performance trends and issues. By automatically connecting infrastructure health with application performance and end-user behavior, you can cut through the noise to find useful signals. Troubleshoot from anywhere in your stack Being fully-connected, the New Relic UI allows you to start your observability journey from any element of your stack. For example, you can get to crucial infrastructure logs from traces of an application running on a problematic Kubernetes pod. Use the Explorer in New Relic One to access and observe the full stack of your software, see performance data and alerting status at a glance, and check relationships. We provide you with a simple, yet powerful visual tool to monitor all your entities, that is, anything we can identify that reports data. In the New Relic ecosystem, entities include basic components like applications, hosts, containers, or database services, but it can also refer to custom groupings of such elements. You can also create your own entities. The more entities you instrument, the more data you'll bring in. The more data you've brought to New Relic, the more you'll understand your metrics, events, logs, and traces. Here are some examples of UI paths you might follow to drill into your data: You want to instrument...

In assessing impact we evaluate: Potential impact to customer workflow Feature usage information Customer feedback In communicating changes, we strive to: Give as much lead time as possible Minimize interruption Provide a documented alternative Lead time for notifications EOL changes are classified into the following categories: Transition impact Description Notification lead time Low Limited changes to customer processes or procedures are anticipated. None to 90 days Moderate Changes to functionality are limited in scope. Actions such as upgrading retired agents to supported versions may be required. Minimum of 90 days High Changes are highly impactful to customers and will require significant investment from customers to adapt. Minimum of 180 days Critical A third party dependency, security issue, or other critical risk causes an urgent need to change or remove functionality on an accelerated timeline. Notified as soon as reasonably practical EOL lead times: impact on distributed software Subject to EOL lead times: Our lead time notifications also apply to distributed software, which is software developed by New Relic that is installed on customer-owned systems. Distributed software is not cloud-based, and has a lifespan from the date of each released version. After that date, it may cease to function or stop reporting data to New Relic. We have fully open sourced many of our distributed software projects as community projects. We also participate in many community-led software development projects. If we have not open sourced our software projects, or if we have designated them as Community Plus projects, the following timeframes apply to them: Released on or after October 1, 2020: These projects will be compatible with our SaaS offering for at least two years after the date of publishing the release. Released prior to October 1, 2020: These projects will be compatible for at least three years after the date of publishing the release. All fixes and security updates are provided in the latest released version of distributed software, and we encourage our customers to keep installed software up to date. In the event a released version of software will cease normal function sooner than two (or three) years, New Relic will follow the EOL process. EOL lead times not applicable: Some of our distributed software have been open sourced, are designated as such, and are available at github.com/newrelic, including: Community projects New Relic One catalog Example code New Relic experimental Archived Our EOL policy does not apply to these projects, which is why we do not provide advance EOL notification for them.

      "body": "For some New Relic solutions, one way to report custom data to New Relic is to use custom attributes. For example, for New Relic browser monitoring, you might create a custom attribute to track the user name associated with a slow or failing request. Requirements Custom attributes are available for these New Relic solutions: APM Browser monitoring Mobile monitoring Infrastructure monitoring For other custom data solutions, see Intro to custom data. APM: Record custom attributes Important Review the list of reserved terms used by NRQL. Using reserved terms can cause issues. To enable and use custom attributes for APM, follow the procedure for your APM agent: C SDK To add custom attributes to applications monitored by the C SDK, call one of the attribute functions; for example, newrelic_add_attribute_double(). The key name for your custom attribute depends on what you specify when you call the function. Go Custom attribute collection is enabled by default in the Go agent. However, you can disable custom attribute collection. Java Custom attribute collection is enabled by default in Java. You can collect custom attributes using XML and the Java agent APIs. These two methods can be used in conjunction with each other. Method How to do it Specify attributes in XML XML allows you to specify custom attributes without changing any of your source code. You can have multiple XML files for custom attributes that are grouped by some logical facet. To set custom attributes for your Java app via XML: Review the New Relic Java agent's documentation about XML file format, methods and classes, and examples. From your Extensions directory within the New Relic Java agent, create a single XML file. Define the methods you want New Relic to monitor by editing your XML file directly. Define an XML instrumentation file using the New Relic UI. This may require additional config in the common: block of your newrelic.yml. See Report custom attributes under Instrumentation options for more detail. Call the agent's API Example 1: Adding custom attributes to transactions To collect custom attributes using the agent's API, call the relevant methods: For each method you want to record an attribute for, call NewRelic.addCustomParameter(...). Optional: Include or exclude certain attributes with attributes.include and attributes.exclude. For example, to record a variable named userId, include this code in the parent method: NewRelic.addCustomParameter(\"userId\", userId); Copy Example 2: Adding custom attributes to spans in distributed traces To collect custom attributes using the agent's API, call the relevant methods: For each span (currently executing method) that you want to record an attribute for, call NewRelic.getAgent().getTracedMethod().addCustomAttribute(...). Optional: Include or exclude certain attributes with span_events.attributes.include and span_events.attributes.exclude. For example, to record a variable named userId on the current span, include this code in the associated method: NewRelic.getAgent().getTracedMethod().addCustomAttribute(\"userId\", userId); Copy Collect user attributes The Java agent also includes a built-in mechanism to enable user attributes and collect user information from HttpServletRequest.getUserPrincipal() as custom attributes. .NET Custom attribute collection is enabled by default in .NET. To collect custom attributes, call the relevant API methods: For each method for which you want to record an attribute, call AddCustomAttribute. Optional: Include or exclude attributes with the include and exclude configuration options. For example, to record attributes for a coupon code (string) and an item ID code (number), you could include this code in the parent method: IAgent agent = NewRelic.Api.Agent.NewRelic.GetAgent(); ITransaction transaction = agent.CurrentTransaction; transaction .AddCustomAttribute(\"Discount Code\", \"Summer Super Sale\") .AddCustomAttribute(\"Item Code\", 31456); Copy Node.js Custom attribute collection is enabled by default in Node.js. To collect custom attributes, call the relevant API method: For each attribute you want to record, call newrelic.addCustomAttribute. To record multiple attributes using a single call, use newrelic.addCustomAttributes. For example, to record attributes for a coupon code and an item ID code, you could include this in the parent method: newrelic.addCustomAttributes({ \"Discount Code\": \"Summer Super Sale\", \"Item Code\": 31456 }); Copy PHP Custom attribute collection is enabled by default in PHP. To collect custom attributes, call the relevant API method for each method that you want to record an attribute; newrelic_add_custom_parameter for transaction events and spans newrelic_add_custom_span_parameter for only spans For example, to record a variable named $userId, include this code in the parent method: newrelic_add_custom_parameter ('userID', $userId) Copy Python Custom attribute collection is enabled by default in Python. To collect custom attributes, call add_custom_parameter for each method that you want to record an attribute. For example, to record a variable named user_id, include this code in the parent method: newrelic.agent.add_custom_parameter('user_id', user_id) Copy Ruby Custom attribute collection is enabled by default in Ruby. To collect custom attributes, call the relevant API methods: For Ruby agent version 3.12.0 or higher, use the add_custom_attributes method. For example, to record a variable named @user_id, include this code in the parent method: ::NewRelic::Agent.add_custom_attributes({ user_id: @user.id }) Copy For Ruby agent version 3.11.2 or lower, use the add_custom_parameters method. For example, to record a variable named @user_id, include this code in the parent method: ::NewRelic::Agent.add_custom_parameters({ user_id: @user.id }) Copy Browser monitoring: Record custom attributes The browser agent provides an API to specify extra details associated with a page view or browser interaction, either by forwarding attributes from APM to browser monitoring or by specifying custom attributes through JavaScript. Values forwarded from the APM agent are encoded and injected into browser attributes by our browser agent. Infrastructure monitoring: Record custom attributes Our Infrastructure monitoring lets you create custom attributes that are used to annotate the data from the infrastructure agent. You can use this metadata to build filter sets, group your results, and annotate your data. Mobile monitoring: Record custom attributes Mobile agents include API calls to record custom attributes: For an overview of mobile monitoring custom data, see Insert custom events and attributes Android method: setAttribute iOS method: setAttribute",

      "body": "This list is current. Networks, IPs, domains, ports, and endpoints last updated September 28, 2021. This is a list of the networks, IP addresses, domains, ports, and endpoints used by API clients or agents to communicate with New Relic. TLS is required for all domains. For information on our FedRAMP endpoints, see our FedRAMP endpoints documentation. Tip This doc describes how to ensure our agents and integrations can access New Relic's domains. To monitor the performance of your network, see Get started with Network Performance Monitoring. TLS encryption To ensure data security for our customers and to be in compliance with FedRAMP and other standards for data encryption, Transport Layer Security (TLS) is required for all domains. Our preferred protocol for all domains is TLS 1.2. For more information, see New Relic's Explorers Hub post about TLS 1.2. In addition, TLS 1.2 is required for most domains, except: APM agent connections Browser agent connections Event API For future updates to required and supported protocol versions, follow the Security Notifications tag in New Relic's Explorers Hub. User-facing domains Your browser must be able to communicate with a number of domains for New Relic One to work properly. Update your allow list to ensure New Relic can communicate with a number of integral domains that are listed in this section. Blocking domains can cause issues with individual product features or prevent pages from loading altogether. This list doesn't cover domains that New Relic connects to that can be blocked without affecting your usage of the product. It also doesn't cover Nerdpacks or other features that communicate with external services that have additional domain requirements. If your organization uses a firewall that restricts outbound traffic, follow the specific procedures for the operating system and the firewall you use to add the following domains to the allow list. Domain Description *.newrelic.com New Relic One and supporting services *.nr-assets.net Static New Relic assets *.nr-ext.net New Relic One Nerdpacks and assets *.amazonaws.com New Relic One catalog assets behind AWS S3 *.cloudfront.net Static New Relic assets behind AWS CloudFront CDN secure.gravatar.com Support for Gravatar avatars fonts.googleapis.com Support for Google Fonts fonts.gstatic.com Support for Google Fonts www.google.com Support for reCAPTCHA www.gstatic.com Support for reCAPTCHA *.nr-data.net OpenTelemetry and Pixie APM agents To enhance network performance and data security, New Relic uses a CDN and DDoS prevention service with a large IP range. New Relic agents require your firewall to allow outgoing connections to the following networks and ports. To add the following IP connections to the allow list, follow the specific procedures for the operating system and the firewall you use. TLS is required for all domains. Use the IP connections for account data in the US or European Union region as appropriate: IP connections APM data Networks US region accounts: 162.247.240.0/22 EU region accounts: 185.221.84.0/22 Ports US region accounts: Default: TCP 443 (recommended) TCP 80 EU region accounts: Default: TCP 443 (recommended) TCP 80 Endpoints US region accounts: collector*.newrelic.com EU region accounts: collector*.eu01.nr-data.net:443 (recommended) Port 443 recommended Recommendation: Use port 443, a secured channel for encrypted HTTPS traffic. Some New Relic agents also offer port 80, an unsecured channel open to all HTTP traffic. While some agents can be configured to use both port 80 and port 443, we recommend that you choose the port 443 (default). If you have an existing configuration that uses port 80, you can update it to use port 443, the default New Relic connection. Agent downloads TLS is required for all domains. Service for download.newrelic.com is provided through Fastly and is subject to change without warning. For the most current list of public IP addresses for New Relic agent downloads, see api.fastly.com/public-ip-list. Infrastructure agents In order to report data to New Relic, our infrastructure monitoring needs outbound access to these domains, networks, and ports. TLS is required for all domains. Use the IP connections for account data in the US or European Union region as appropriate: IP connections Infrastructure data Domains infra-api.newrelic.com: Required to submit events, metrics, and inventory data. identity-api.newrelic.com: Required for entity registration (for example, a host entity). infrastructure-command-api.newrelic.com: Required to determine feature flags.

TLS is required for all addresses in these blocks. Network blocks for US region accounts: 162.247.240.0/22 Network blocks for EU region accounts: 158.177.65.64/29 159.122.103.184/29 161.156.125.32/28 These network blocks also apply to third-party ticketing integrations and New Relic cloud integrations. Pixie integration The Pixie integration runs in your Kubernetes cluster and pulls a set of curated observability data from Pixie to send it to New Relic using the OpenTelemetry line protocol. The Pixie integration requires outbound network access to the following: work.withpixie.ai:443 otlp.nr-data.net:4317 (US region accounts) otlp.eu01.nr-data.net:4317 (EU region accounts) OpenTelemetry New Relic supports the native OpenTelemetry Protocol (OTLP) for exporting telemetry data. This allows you to use the vendor neutral components developed by the OpenTelemetry community to export your data to New Relic. To export OTLP data to New Relic, configure the OTLP exporter to add a header ( api-key ) whose value is your account license key. And, based on your region, configure the endpoint where the exporter sends data to New Relic.

      "body": "In the software industry, a tag typically refers to a piece of metadata added to a data set for the purpose of improving data organization and findability. At New Relic, our tags are key:value pairs (like team: operations) added to various sets of data, like monitored apps and hosts, agents, dashboards, and workloads. We make some important attributes available as tags (for example, app metadata like app name and language, and host metadata like host name and AWS region). You can also add your own custom tags. You can use tags in the UI to filter down to relevant data. Here is an example: Here you can see an accountId tag being used to filter workloads to a specific account. Tags help you to: Organize data coming from a large number of sources and/or to a large number of New Relic accounts. Identify teams, roles, environments, or regions to know who’s responsible for what (see example use cases). Better organize and search dashboards and workloads. Query and chart APM data. Tags are useful for organizing data at a high level. If you want to add more fine-grained detail, like capturing user names or other high-cardinality values, custom attributes or custom events are a better solution. Tip Tags were previously called labels in the New Relic UI. You may sometimes see labelin our code; for example, some of our APM agent config files use a label config option for tags. Tag format and limits Format requirements and limits for tags: The UI has limits on the total number of tags it can display per entity: Limit of 100 for tags reported by default or added via agent/integration configuration. Limit of 100 for custom tags added via UI or API. The following are maximum character length for tags: Key: 128 characters Value: 256 characters Allowed characters: Characters must be UTF-8. When using NerdGraph to add tags, a dash (-) in a tag key is interpreted as a minus symbol. If your tag key has a dash, use back ticks around it (like `key-name`). Best practices and tips Before adding tags, we recommend first seeing how our default tags work for you. When you're ready to add your own tags, review the following best practices tips to get the most out of them. Tips on keeping tags simple: Start by adding only tags you know you’ll definitely use. Unused tags create noise and may add confusion. Try to use short tags. Shorter tags are easier to parse, and also the UI may sometimes truncate longer tags. (See character limits.) When possible, use keys and values that are human-readable (for example, region: EMEA is better than Param8323 : 1229072). Avoid including several values like regions: EMEA | US | LATAM in a single tag. We recommend using three different tags for that, like region: emea, region: us, and region: latam. If you want to match multiple tags, you can do that using the advanced options in the filter UI. Tips on using tags consistently: Try to be consistent with tag language across your teams and entities. Be consistent with naming. For example, avoid using both region: emea and reg: emea. Be consistent with format. For example, avoid using both camelCase and kebab-case. Although tag searching is not case-sensitive in the UI and API, try to be consistent with capitalization. For example, avoid using both env: staging and env: Staging. Tips on cross-team implementation: Tags help improve observability and cost allocation. For this reason, responsibility for tag implementation is often assigned to an observability team, SREs, a group of architects, or a cross-team task force. We recommend the people responsible for implementing tags meet and create an internal policy to describe how the tags are defined and which conventions are to be used. Then: Keep this reference manual up to date. Automate the definition of tags when you deploy New Relic agents, at the cloud provider, or through New Relic automation tools, such as the API or Terraform. Create recurring reports that identify entities that are non-compliant with your tagging standards. Tag examples Here are some examples of common ways to use tags to organize data: Team-related tags Creating tags for team names can be helpful to understand which team, group, department, or region was responsible for a change that led to a performance issue. Team examples: team: backend team: frontend team: db Role examples: roles: architecture roles: devops roles: pm Region examples: region: emea region: america region: asia Environment-related tags You can create entities for the environment they belong to. Examples: env: production env: qa env: development env: staging Criticality-related tags You can create tags related to criticality levels, which lets you easier track the most critical issues. Examples: layer: level1 layer: level2 layer: level3 How tags are added Some important attributes, by default, are available for use as tags. For example, the account name, the account ID, and some basic host/server metadata are available as default tags. You can't remove these available-by-default tags. Here are some details about how tags are added for some specific data sources: Add tags via UI or API When you add tags via the UI or API, this occurs at the entity level. This means that, for example, if you have multiple APM agents monitoring a single entity and apply a tag via the UI, that tag is available for all data coming from that entity. To add or delete tags via the UI: Select a monitored entity, like a monitored app or host. Near the entity’s name at the top of the page, select the See metadata and manage tags menu. In the menu that pops up, add or delete a tag. For APM agents, restart your service. To manage tags via API: see our NerdGraph tagging docs. For a guide to using our CLI to automate tagging, see our developer site. APM agent tags You can add tags via the UI and API or you can add tags using APM agent configuration, both methods require you to restart your service. There are differences in how these apply tags: Via agent config: These tags are applied at the agent-level, not the entity/application level. This would be a good option if you have multiple agents monitoring different aspects of the same app (for example, a blue-green deployment model). Via the UI or API: These tags are applied at the entity/application level. Here are links to the agent configuration options: C SDK: not available Java Go .NET Node.js PHP Python Ruby For information on querying APM tags, see Query APM tags. And check out this short video on querying APM tags (3:20 minutes). Infrastructure data tags There are several ways tags are added to infrastructure entities and services: Use the UI or API to add tags at the entity level. Infrastructure agent: some attributes are available by default as tags. You can also add custom attributes, which are also available as tags in the UI. On-host integrations: some attributes are available by default as tags. You can also add tags by using integration-specific labels config options (for an example, see the labels config for the Apache integration). Cloud service integrations: by default we report tags and labels that are defined in the cloud service. To add tags, you'd add them on the cloud-service-side. Automate tags with our CLI For a guide to automating tags using our CLI tool, see our developer site. Use tags to filter the UI Use the filter field at the top of the New Relic Explorer to filter down to the entities you care about. You can use multiple filter conditions. To filter down to certain entities using tags: From one.newrelic.com, click Explorer. Click the Filter by... field to see a dropdown of available attributes and tags. You can filter by multiple elements and use advanced search options. To find an entity’s metadata and tags from the UI, here are two options: From a list of entities in the UI, at the far right, select an entity's icon. OR Select an entity. Near the top of the page, select the icon. To use the API to view tags, see our NerdGraph docs. Learn about how to use tags with dashboards and how to use tags with workloads. Custom queries, charts, and alerts Different features handle tags differently. Here are some details about how you can use NRQL to query tag data, or create NRQL condition alerts. Query and alert on APM tags You can query APM tags using NRQL. Minimum agent versions: C: not available Go: 2.3.0 Java: 4.9.0 .NET: 8.17 Node: v4.13.0 PHP: not available Python: v4.10.0.112 Ruby: 6.1.0.352 Here are some query examples: Throughput across shards Given a service that is distributed across nine shards, each shard assigned as an environment, we can plot the transaction throughput on all shards using a wildcard query like: SELECT rate(count(apm.service.transaction.duration), 1 minute) FROM Metric WHERE appName LIKE 'MyApp (%' AND transactionType = 'Other' FACET tags.Environment TIMESERIES Copy Transactions per team To see the number of transactions per service for a specific team, we might use a query like: FROM Transaction SELECT count(*) WHERE tags.Team = 'team-a' FACET tags.Project TIMESERIES Copy Alert on error rate for teams You can use a query for your services’ error rate for setting an alert without having to create a rule for each service. Here is the error rate for all services on a team called team-b. And this alert will automatically monitor any new app names added with the team tag. FROM Metric SELECT count(apm.service.error.count) / count(apm.service.transaction.duration) WHERE tags.Team = 'team-b' FACET appName Copy Related to this, you might create a general rule for a specific service deployed across several environments, so that we have an alarm for a single service monitoring each environment individually: From Metric SELECT count(apm.service.error.count) / count(apm.service.transaction.duration) WHERE tags.Project = 'MyProject' FACET tags.Environment Copy Query and alert on attributes As explained in the tag sources information, some important attributes are used as tags. You can query all attributes and create custom charts using NRQL, and create NRQL alert conditions.",

In some cases, when MGIs with a significant high number of metrics are detected, a rule is created automatically to protect the platform from performance degradation. Metric normalization rules management You can create and manage new rules that deal with the noise produced from high cardinality metrics by using the metric normalization tool, which is accessible from each service dashboard in the New Relic Explorer.

      "body": "New Relic monitoring is built around the concept of entities. In this doc, you'll learn how we define entities, what you can do with them, and how you can create your own entities or groupings of entities. What's an entity? From a New Relic perspective, entity is purposefully a broad concept. An entity is anything that a) reports data to New Relic or that contains data that we have access to, and b) is something we've identified with a unique entity ID. For most entities, the ID is indicated by the attribute entityGuid. An entity can be any fundamental data-reporting component, like an application, a host, or a database service, but it can also refer to larger groupings of those components. For example, to monitor a data center, you could aggregate those hosts in New Relic to be a workload (a custom grouping of entities). That workload is, itself, also an entity. Also very important is the relationships between entities. Our behind-the-scenes relationship-mapping helps us understand how entities are connected, how they affect each other. And this allows us to give you the power to configure how any data you're bringing in is related to existing entities, or how it's related to other entities. Our focus on entities and their relationships is important because our goal is to give you practical information about your business-important entities, and not give you an unhelpfully huge stream of data from a huge list of monitored things. With more insight at the entity level, you can better monitor and troubleshoot complex, modern systems. Find and explore entities and entity data Tip You can create new entity types for monitoring any data source. Learn more about entity synthesis. Some tips for finding and understanding entity data: To find an entity's entityGuid and entityName and other metadata: from any list of monitored entities in the New Relic Explorer, click an entity's icon, and click See metadata and tags. For most entities, its GUID is reported as the attribute entityGuid. For workloads, it's workloadGuid. You can run NRQL queries to find entities by their GUID. To see connections between entities, you have several options: When viewing an entity in the UI, use the Related entities UI. Service maps. Distributed tracing. Our NerdGraph API. To group entities together, see Group entities. Customize entity definitions and relationships. To learn technical details about entity types, see our GitHub repo. In an entity type's definition file, you'll see information like: The domain: for example, APM, or Infra. Its type: for example, Application or AWSECSCONTAINERINSTANCE. Default tags. The entityExpirationTime: how long data from that entity lasts in the UI, which is different from database data retention. Group and organize entities You can place entities into groups that reflect business-important relationships in your organization. For example, you might group all entities related to a specific team or department, or related to a specific service. Or you might group multiple hosts together to reflect their grouping in a data center. To group your entities, see: Tag entities. Create workloads, which allow you to group business-important sets of entities. Create entities and customize entity data Customize entity data with entity synthesis If you have telemetry from any source that's not supported by New Relic out of the box, you can propose a mapping for it. Once approved, any telemetry received by New Relic that matches your definition file will be synthesized into an entity. To learn more: For reserved attributes and how entity relationships are defined, keep reading this doc. For how to do the work of modifying existing entity types or creating new ones, see our GitHub repo on entity synthesis. Reserved attributes for synthesized entities These attributes are meant to be synthesized from the telemetry we receive. Do not set them unless you're aware of the implications and consequences. Attribute Description entity.guid Generally, you should not set this attribute field on your telemetry data. New Relic may add this field to ingested data to store a unique identifier for the entity associated with the data point. If telemetry arrives with the entity.guid attribute already present, then New Relic will not change the value. However, it may cause undefined behavior such as missing entities in the UI, or telemetry not associating with the expected entities. One use case for passing this attribute is to associate ingested telemetry with an entity already created by New Relic. When the entity.guid attribute is sent, the value will override New Relic’s entity identification system (such as entity synthesis definitions) and instead will use the attribute as the data. entity.name This attribute shouldn't be put on ingested telemetry data unless you're trying to override the entity name that would have been selected by New Relic’s entity identification system. While New Relic won't change the value if it's already present on the data, New Relic may add the attribute to your data. Therefore invalid or unexpected values may cause undefined behavior such as missing entities in the UI, or telemetry not associating with the expected entities. If this field is present on ingested telemetry, its value will be used to name the entity associated with the data point. This name will be used instead of the name selected by New Relic’s entity identification system (for example, entity synthesis definitions). Note that many entities use the name as part of their identification, so changing this field may result in the generation of a new entity. entity.type This attribute shouldn't be put on ingested telemetry data except for certain legacy cases where it's required to distinguish entity types. Passing this field may interfere with entity detection, particularly if unrecognized values are sent in this field. While New Relic won't change the value if already present on the data, the field is not guaranteed to provide unambiguous filtering of telemetry at query-time. Existing entity definitions already have overlapping values, and we recommend avoiding entity.type in favor of other fields for filtering telemetry queries. This field is used by New Relic, meaning that invalid or unexpected values may cause undefined behavior such as missing entities in the UI, or telemetry not associating with the expected entities. To learn how to do the work of modifying existing entity types or creating new ones, see our GitHub repo on entity synthesis. Entity relationships Connections between entities are automatically created by New Relic based on what we can infer from your telemetry. For example, when two services that communicate using HTTP are instrumented with New Relic, we infer a \"calls/called-by\" relationship between them. When viewing a specific entity in either the New Relic Explorer, Navigator, or Lookout, you can see its Related entities in the entity's mini overview. This gives a visualization of the various entities connected directly to the current entity. You can quickly view important metrics for these related entities and navigate from one entity to another, through all the connected parts of your stack. Tip Learn more about how entities are related with our NerdGraph API. When relationships are not automatically detected, you can manually create them using the \"Add/edit related entities\" link in Related entities. Important Currently, you can only manually create calls/called-by relationships between service entities. Tip To manage manual relationships, you need to have modify and delete capabilities on entity relationships. If you don’t see the edit relationships button, contact your account admin. Which relationships are created? These are the relationships created between entities: Source: New Relic agent Relationship source Relationship type Relationship target Why is the relationship created? Application instrumented with a New Relic agent CALLS Application instrumented with a New Relic agent Relationships between applications monitored by New Relic agents are reported using the DurationByCaller metric. The callee reports the metric. For example, the metric DurationByCaller/Mobile/100/1234/HTTP/all indicates that the caller is APPLICATION 1234 for account 100. Application instrumented with a New Relic agent CALLS Service instrumented with a New Relic agent An application (caller) that calls a service (callee) monitored by New Relic creates a relationship that's reported by the caller using the ExternalApp metric. For example, the metric ExternalApp/dirac.vips.net/100#1234/all indicates that the callee is APPLICATION 1234 for account 100. The metric is reported if the callee successfully responds to the caller. Service instrumented with a New Relic agent CALLS Service instrumented with a New Relic agent When a New Relic agent detects that a service (caller) calls another service (callee) instrumented by New Relic, the callee reports the metric ClientApplication. For example, the metric ClientApplication/100#1234/all indicates that the caller is APPLICATION 1234 for account 100. Service instrumented with a New Relic agent CALLS A datastore instance When an application calls a datastore instance it creates a relationship reported with the DatastoreInstance metric. For example, the metric Datastore/instance/MySQL/172.16.16.3/3306 indicates the datastore instance is vendor: MySQL, host: 172.16.16.3, port: 3306. This metric also supports the legacy datastore instance format Datastore/instance/MySQL/172.16.16.3:3306. Currently we cannot determine whether the datastore instance is instrumented by New Relic and has an entity associated to it. APM agent SERVES Browser agent This relationship is created when an APM agent injects the browser agent into a page. Workload entity CONTAINS Any entity When a workload is created or updated, relationships for each of the entities that belong to the workload are created. Because some workloads are “dynamic” (defined by tags), relationships are re-created every 5 minutes. This way entities can join or leave the workload. Source: Infrastructure Relationship source Relationship type Relationship target Why is the relationship created? Infrastructure host HOSTS Application This relationship is created when an application is running in one or more hosts, and the infra agent is running in those hosts. Infrastructure host HOSTS Container This relationship is created when containers are running in one or more hosts, and the host is instrumented with the infra agent. Source: Synthetics monitor Relationship source Relationship type Relationship target Why is the relationship created? Synthetics Monitor CALLS Browser agent This relationship is created when a synthetics monitor checks a page instrumented with the browser agent. Synthetics Monitor CALLS APM application Agent events that contain the attribute nr.syntheticsMonitorId have been described as synthetics monitors (the source) interacting with an APM application (the target). If the header exists and the APM application Id exists, a relationship is created between the monitor and the app. Source: Kubernetes Relationship source Relationship type Relationship target Why is the relationship created? Cluster CONTAINS Pod This relationship is created when a pod is created in a cluster instrumented with the New Relic Kubernetes integration. Cluster CONTAINS Deployment This relationship is created when a deployment is created in a cluster instrumented with the New Relic Kubernetes integration. Cluster CONTAINS DaemonSet This relationship is created when a DaemonSet is created in a cluster instrumented with the New Relic Kubernetes integration. Cluster CONTAINS StatefulSet This relationship is created when a StatefulSet is created in a cluster instrumented with the New Relic Kubernetes integration. Cluster CONTAINS Host This relationship is created when a host that's part of a cluster is instrumented with the New Relic Kubernetes integration. Deployment CONTAINS Pod This relationship is created when a deployment creates a pod in a cluster instrumented with the New Relic Kubernetes integration. DaemonSet CONTAINS Pod This relationship is created when a DaemonSet is created a pod in a cluster instrumented with the New Relic Kubernetes integration. StatefulSet CONTAINS Pod This relationship is created when a StatefulSet creates a pod in a cluster instrumented with the New Relic Kubernetes integration. Pod CONTAINS Container This relationship is created when a pod creates a container in a cluster instrumented with the New Relic Kubernetes integration. Host HOSTS Pod This relationship is created when a pod is running in a host that's part of a cluster instrumented with the New Relic Kubernetes integration. Container HOSTS Application This relationship is created when an application is running in docker, and the hosts where docker is running are instrumented by the the infra agent. External services Relationship source Relationship type Relationship target Why is the relationship created? External service CALLS External service When the relationship is created, the external service reports a span with its name on the service.name attribute and the name of the service that initiates the call in the parent.service.name attribute. Application IS External service A relationship between an application and an external service is created so that users can navigate between them using the related entities component. Browser application instrumented with a New Relic agent CALLS External service A browser application reports an Ajax/HostTransaction metric when calling an external service (URL). Example metric: Ajax/HostTransaction/api.segment.io:443/CallbackTime' Cluster CONTAINS External service When the relationship is created, the external service reports a span with the attribute k8s.cluster.name, the name of the cluster. The cluster must be instrumented with the New Relic Kubernetes integration and the cluster name set for the integration must match the one reported in the span. Pod HOSTS External service When the relationship is created, the external service reports a span with the following attributes: service.name: The name of the service. k8s.cluster.name: The name of the cluster. k8s.pod.name: The name of the pod that’s running the service. k8s.namespace.name: The namespace where the pod was created. The cluster must be instrumented with the New Relic Kubernetes integration and the cluster name set for the integration must match the one reported in the span. Create relationships manually You can create additional relationships using NerdGraph, our GraphQL API. Relationships can be created or replaced using the mutation entityRelationshipUserDefinedCreateOrReplace. As its name suggests, it allows you to create a relationship between two entities with a given type. If the relationship already exists between the two entities, it will be added again with the updated given values: the creation time and the creator user id: mutation { entityRelationshipUserDefinedCreateOrReplace( sourceEntityGuid: \"{SourceEntityGuid}\" targetEntityGuid: \"{TargetEntityGuid}\" type: BUILT_FROM ) { errors { message type } } } Copy Delete relationships using the mutation entityRelationshipUserDefinedDelete. source and target are mandatory, whereas type isn't. If the mutation its executed without any type, all the relationships between the two entities will be removed. mutation { entityRelationshipUserDefinedDelete( sourceEntityGuid: \"{SourceEntityGuid}\" targetEntityGuid: \"{TargetEntityGuid}\" type: BUILT_FROM ) { errors { message type } } } Copy Find information about fetching relationships in the relationships API tutorial. Some considerations Two entities can have multiple relationships, one for each relationship type. Two entities can hold a relationship IF they belong to the same trusted account. For each entity, you can manually define up to 2000 relationships. When the limit is reached, the API will return a LIMIT_EXCEEDED error. Each mutation can fail if you don't have access to one of the two entities (source/target). Relationship types provide additional information about how two entities are related. The supported relationship types are: Relationship types Type Description CALLS The relationship between one service or application calling another. Used to display upstream and downstream services. CONTAINS The relationship and hierarchical use cases common to modern and cloud infrastructure. For example, this could indicate that the HOST contains a container. HOSTS The relationship between an application or process and the system it runs on. SERVES The relationship between a back-end application and the browser application it returns in the response. is The relationship between an entity captured as a separate entity by another telemetry data source and the one you're currently viewing. CONNECTS_TO The source entity has a connection to the target entity. BUILT_FROM The target entity contains the code for the source entity.",
