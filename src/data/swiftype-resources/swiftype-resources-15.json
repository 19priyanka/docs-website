      "body": "Mobile monitoring for Android monitors your mobile app, giving you a comprehensive view of your app's performance. It works for Android apps written using Java or Kotlin. Install the Android agent Before you install the Android agent, make sure your app follows the compatibility requirements. As part of the installation process, mobile monitoring automatically generates an application token. This is a 40-character hexadecimal string for authenticating each mobile app that you monitor. Follow the Android installation and configuration procedures for your environment as applicable. If you have problems with your Android installation, or if you do not see data in the mobile monitoring UI for your Android app, follow the troubleshooting procedures. Extend your instrumentation After you install the agent, extend the agent's instrumentation by using the mobile monitoring UI and following up on information in New Relic Insights. To access: In mobile monitoring: In NRQL and dashboards: Custom data Create and record custom events, interaction traces, and attributes to add details to your existing data and traces. Then, view the custom events that you created in NRQL or dashboards. Network requests Enable the MobileRequest event feature so you can perform a full network analysis. To further investigate network request error rates and response times, query MobileRequest and MobileRequestError events. Crash analysis Review detailed information using groups and filters to analyze trends that lead to crashes. To view more information about crashes, create NRQL queries to review Insights charts related to crash data. Android SDK API Use the Android SDK API for mobile monitoring to instrument parts of your code that are not instrumented by default. Then, view those custom events and attributes in New Relic Insights. Handled exceptions Report exceptions so you can identify factors creating a poor mobile app experience. To further improve performance, review MobileHandledException event records in New Relic Insights. Breadcrumbs Boost the level of detail in crash event trails by adding breadcrumbs. Then, query MobileBreadcrumbs events to see all breadcrumbs or just breadcrumbs related to crashes. See your errors in CodeStream You can also see your Android application's directly in your IDE using CodeStream and errors inbox. To do this, install CodeStream, connect CodeStream and New Relic and create Git tags that match your appVersion.",

      "body": "Important Starting with version 5.9.0 of the New Relic Android agent, you can set a custom user identifier value to associate user sessions with analytics events and attributes. For more information, see the NewRelic.setUserId method. The Android agent provides an SDK API to set up custom instrumentation for monitoring your application. The API gives you the ability to: Instrument your own code. Create, name, and end interaction traces from events in your mobile app. Record custom metrics. Send custom attributes and events to New Relic Insights. Track networking from libraries not supported automatically. Install the SDK Before using the Android SDK API: Review the Android SDK API release notes to ensure you have your app instrumented with a current SDK for mobile monitoring. Go to one.newrelic.com, click Add more data and then follow the steps for Android. For more information, see the detailed Android installation and configuration procedures. If you need to support Android 2.2, see the legacy Android agent SDK procedures. Instrument your code Caution Tracing is heavily optimized, but it does impose a performance overhead. Avoid instrumenting methods that are expected to be called hundreds of times. If you have custom libraries or application code that you want to include in interaction traces: Use the following Java annotation: import com.newrelic.agent.android.instrumentation.Trace; Copy Add the @Trace annotation to the methods you want to instrument: @Trace public void myHeavyweightMethod() { … Copy To indicate what kind of method is being traced, use the optional category attribute. Automatically instrumented methods Automatic instrumentation is one of the agent's more convenient features. However, if it interferes with the method being traced, add @SkipTrace to the method, and the agent will skip it during compile time instrumentation.

Create an attribute: setAttribute Increment an attribute count: incrementAttribute Remove an attribute: removeAttribute Remove all attributes: removeAllAttributes Record custom event: recordCustomEvent Record a breadcrumb event: recordBreadcrumb Set the maximum size of an event pool: setMaxEventPoolSize Set maximum time agent stores events in memory: setMaxEventBufferTime Return the current session's ID: currentSessionId Set custom user ID for associating sessions with events and attributes: setUserId Track custom network requests and failures Use these methods: Record HTTP transactions at varying levels of detail: See noticeHttpTransaction. Record network failures: See noticeNetworkFailure. Record a handled exception as an event, including context See recordHandledException(). Manual cross application tracing The noticeHttpTransaction code does not automatically append the appropriate header ID value needed to get cross application tracing to work. This is why you will not see the application link in your Android app on New Relic's Map page for mobile apps or on the HTTP requests page. You can use a public method in the New Relic Android SDK to get the appropriate ID to pass along with your HTTP request to your back-end application, as long as it is already instrumented by New Relic. The appropriate header ID will be passed from the back-end application in the response, providing everything needed for cross application tracing to function. Cross application tracing example This example adds the NewRelic-ID to the back-end HTTP request, with conn as the external HTTP connection. (Notice the additional import.) import com.newrelic.agent.android.NewRelic; import com.newrelic.agent.android.Agent; //required for getCrossProcessId() ... ... //new method for appending the crossProcessID necessary for CAT in New Relic public static void setCrossProcessHeader(HttpURLConnection conn) { String crossProcessId = Agent.getCrossProcessId(); // API call into the agent for the X-NewRelic-ID if (crossProcessId != null) { conn.setRequestProperty(\"X-NewRelic-ID\", crossProcessId); } } Copy After adding the appropriate header to the request to the back-end app, the response from the app needs to be parsed for the X-Newrelic-App-Data header, and then added to the noticeHttpTransaction call as a string. For example: //NewRelic.noticeHttpTransaction(url, httpMethod, statusCode, startTimeMs, endTimeMs, bytesSent, bytesReceived, responseBody, params, response); //Where xNewRelicAppDataHeader is the value of the X-NewRelic-App-Data header NewRelic.noticeHttpTransaction(\"http://api.newrelic.com\", \"GET\", 200, System.nanoTime(), System.nanoTime(),100 ,100, \"Test\", new HashMap<String, String>(), xNewRelicAppDataHeader); Copy",

Requirements Compatible with all agent versions. Description The New Relic Android SDK API provides several methods to track network requests. If a network request fails, you can record details about the failure with noticeNetworkFailure. In most cases, place this call inside exception handlers, such as catch blocks. For general info on using the New Relic Android SDK API, see the usage guide. Parameters Parameter Description NewRelic.noticeNetworkFailure(string $url, string $httpMethod, long $startTime, long $endTime, exception $exception OR $networkFailure) Copy $url string Required. The URL of the request. $httpMethod string Required. The HTTP method used, such as GET or POST. $startTime long Required. The start time of the request in milliseconds since the epoch. $endTime long Required. The end time of the request in milliseconds since the epoch. $exception string Either this or $failure parameter is required. This is the exception that occurred. New Relic can automatically translate many common exceptions into network failure types. $failure enum Either this or $exception parameter is required. The type of network failure that occurred. If an exception cannot be resolved to a network failure automatically, this method can be used to categorize the failure accurately. The values are defined by the NetworkFailure enum. Valid values include Unknown, BadURL, TimedOut, CannotConnectToHost, DNSLookupFailed, BadServerResponse, and SecureConnectionFailed. Examples Record network failure Here’s an example of an error listener that uses an error as part of the noticed network failure to New Relic: new Response.ErrorListener() { @Override public void onErrorResponse(Error error) { NewRelic.noticeNetworkFailure(badUrl, \"GET\", System.nanoTime(), System.nanoTime(), NetworkFailure.exceptionToNetworkFailure(error)); } Copy",

Requirements Compatible with all agent versions. Description The New Relic Android SDK API provides several methods to track network requests. If a network request fails, you can record details about the failure with noticeNetworkFailure. In most cases, place this call inside exception handlers, such as catch blocks. For general info on using the New Relic Android SDK API, see the usage guide. Parameters Parameter Description NewRelic.noticeNetworkFailure(string $url, string $httpMethod, long $startTime, long $endTime, exception $exception OR $networkFailure) Copy $url string Required. The URL of the request. $httpMethod string Required. The HTTP method used, such as GET or POST. $startTime long Required. The start time of the request in milliseconds since the epoch. $endTime long Required. The end time of the request in milliseconds since the epoch. $exception string Either this or $failure parameter is required. This is the exception that occurred. New Relic can automatically translate many common exceptions into network failure types. $failure enum Either this or $exception parameter is required. The type of network failure that occurred. If an exception cannot be resolved to a network failure automatically, this method can be used to categorize the failure accurately. The values are defined by the NetworkFailure enum. Valid values include Unknown, BadURL, TimedOut, CannotConnectToHost, DNSLookupFailed, BadServerResponse, and SecureConnectionFailed. Examples Record network failure Here’s an example of an error listener that uses an error as part of the noticed network failure to New Relic: new Response.ErrorListener() { @Override public void onErrorResponse(Error error) { NewRelic.noticeNetworkFailure(badUrl, \"GET\", System.nanoTime(), System.nanoTime(), NetworkFailure.exceptionToNetworkFailure(error)); } Copy",

Install the Android agent Before you install the Android agent, make sure your app follows the compatibility requirements. As part of the installation process, mobile monitoring automatically generates an application token. This is a 40-character hexadecimal string for authenticating each mobile app that you monitor. Follow the Android installation and configuration procedures for your environment as applicable. If you have problems with your Android installation, or if you do not see data in the mobile monitoring UI for your Android app, follow the troubleshooting procedures. Extend your instrumentation After you install the agent, extend the agent's instrumentation by using the mobile monitoring UI and following up on information in New Relic Insights. To access: In mobile monitoring: In NRQL and dashboards: Custom data Create and record custom events, interaction traces, and attributes to add details to your existing data and traces. Then, view the custom events that you created in NRQL or dashboards. Network requests Enable the MobileRequest event feature so you can perform a full network analysis. To further investigate network request error rates and response times, query MobileRequest and MobileRequestError events. Crash analysis Review detailed information using groups and filters to analyze trends that lead to crashes. To view more information about crashes, create NRQL queries to review Insights charts related to crash data. Android SDK API Use the Android SDK API for mobile monitoring to instrument parts of your code that are not instrumented by default. Then, view those custom events and attributes in New Relic Insights. Handled exceptions Report exceptions so you can identify factors creating a poor mobile app experience. To further improve performance, review MobileHandledException event records in New Relic Insights. Breadcrumbs Boost the level of detail in crash event trails by adding breadcrumbs. Then, query MobileBreadcrumbs events to see all breadcrumbs or just breadcrumbs related to crashes. See your errors in CodeStream You can also see your Android application's directly in your IDE using CodeStream and errors inbox. To do this, install CodeStream, connect CodeStream and New Relic and create Git tags that match your appVersion.",

      "body": "Important Starting with version 5.9.0 of the New Relic Android agent, you can set a custom user identifier value to associate user sessions with analytics events and attributes. For more information, see the NewRelic.setUserId method. The Android agent provides an SDK API to set up custom instrumentation for monitoring your application. The API gives you the ability to: Instrument your own code. Create, name, and end interaction traces from events in your mobile app. Record custom metrics. Send custom attributes and events to New Relic Insights. Track networking from libraries not supported automatically. Install the SDK Before using the Android SDK API: Review the Android SDK API release notes to ensure you have your app instrumented with a current SDK for mobile monitoring. Go to one.newrelic.com, click Add more data and then follow the steps for Android. For more information, see the detailed Android installation and configuration procedures. If you need to support Android 2.2, see the legacy Android agent SDK procedures. Instrument your code Caution Tracing is heavily optimized, but it does impose a performance overhead. Avoid instrumenting methods that are expected to be called hundreds of times. If you have custom libraries or application code that you want to include in interaction traces: Use the following Java annotation: import com.newrelic.agent.android.instrumentation.Trace; Copy Add the @Trace annotation to the methods you want to instrument: @Trace public void myHeavyweightMethod() { … Copy To indicate what kind of method is being traced, use the optional category attribute. Automatically instrumented methods Automatic instrumentation is one of the agent's more convenient features. However, if it interferes with the method being traced, add @SkipTrace to the method, and the agent will skip it during compile time instrumentation.

Name or rename an interaction See setInteractionName. End an interaction See endInteraction. Disable or enable all interactions See withInteractionTracing. Set an app version associated with an interaction See withApplicationVersion. Set custom build ID See withApplicationBuild. Create custom metrics See recordMetric. Report custom attributes and events There are several ways to add custom attributes and events. For more about which would be the best method to use and why, see Add custom data. Create an attribute: setAttribute Increment an attribute count: incrementAttribute Remove an attribute: removeAttribute Remove all attributes: removeAllAttributes Record custom event: recordCustomEvent Record a breadcrumb event: recordBreadcrumb Set the maximum size of an event pool: setMaxEventPoolSize Set maximum time agent stores events in memory: setMaxEventBufferTime Return the current session's ID: currentSessionId Set custom user ID for associating sessions with events and attributes: setUserId Track custom network requests and failures Use these methods: Record HTTP transactions at varying levels of detail: See noticeHttpTransaction. Record network failures: See noticeNetworkFailure. Record a handled exception as an event, including context See recordHandledException(). Manual cross application tracing The noticeHttpTransaction code does not automatically append the appropriate header ID value needed to get cross application tracing to work. This is why you will not see the application link in your Android app on New Relic's Map page for mobile apps or on the HTTP requests page. You can use a public method in the New Relic Android SDK to get the appropriate ID to pass along with your HTTP request to your back-end application, as long as it is already instrumented by New Relic. The appropriate header ID will be passed from the back-end application in the response, providing everything needed for cross application tracing to function. Cross application tracing example This example adds the NewRelic-ID to the back-end HTTP request, with conn as the external HTTP connection. (Notice the additional import.) import com.newrelic.agent.android.NewRelic; import com.newrelic.agent.android.Agent; //required for getCrossProcessId() ... ... //new method for appending the crossProcessID necessary for CAT in New Relic public static void setCrossProcessHeader(HttpURLConnection conn) { String crossProcessId = Agent.getCrossProcessId(); // API call into the agent for the X-NewRelic-ID if (crossProcessId != null) { conn.setRequestProperty(\"X-NewRelic-ID\", crossProcessId); } } Copy After adding the appropriate header to the request to the back-end app, the response from the app needs to be parsed for the X-Newrelic-App-Data header, and then added to the noticeHttpTransaction call as a string. For example: //NewRelic.noticeHttpTransaction(url, httpMethod, statusCode, startTimeMs, endTimeMs, bytesSent, bytesReceived, responseBody, params, response); //Where xNewRelicAppDataHeader is the value of the X-NewRelic-App-Data header NewRelic.noticeHttpTransaction(\"http://api.newrelic.com\", \"GET\", 200, System.nanoTime(), System.nanoTime(),100 ,100, \"Test\", new HashMap<String, String>(), xNewRelicAppDataHeader); Copy",

Record network failures: See noticeNetworkFailure. Record a handled exception as an event, including context See recordHandledException(). Manual cross application tracing The noticeHttpTransaction code does not automatically append the appropriate header ID value needed to get cross application tracing to work. This is why you will not see the application link in your Android app on New Relic's Map page for mobile apps or on the HTTP requests page. You can use a public method in the New Relic Android SDK to get the appropriate ID to pass along with your HTTP request to your back-end application, as long as it is already instrumented by New Relic. The appropriate header ID will be passed from the back-end application in the response, providing everything needed for cross application tracing to function. Cross application tracing example This example adds the NewRelic-ID to the back-end HTTP request, with conn as the external HTTP connection. (Notice the additional import.) import com.newrelic.agent.android.NewRelic; import com.newrelic.agent.android.Agent; //required for getCrossProcessId() ... ... //new method for appending the crossProcessID necessary for CAT in New Relic public static void setCrossProcessHeader(HttpURLConnection conn) { String crossProcessId = Agent.getCrossProcessId(); // API call into the agent for the X-NewRelic-ID if (crossProcessId != null) { conn.setRequestProperty(\"X-NewRelic-ID\", crossProcessId); } } Copy After adding the appropriate header to the request to the back-end app, the response from the app needs to be parsed for the X-Newrelic-App-Data header, and then added to the noticeHttpTransaction call as a string. For example: //NewRelic.noticeHttpTransaction(url, httpMethod, statusCode, startTimeMs, endTimeMs, bytesSent, bytesReceived, responseBody, params, response); //Where xNewRelicAppDataHeader is the value of the X-NewRelic-App-Data header NewRelic.noticeHttpTransaction(\"http://api.newrelic.com\", \"GET\", 200, System.nanoTime(), System.nanoTime(),100 ,100, \"Test\", new HashMap<String, String>(), xNewRelicAppDataHeader); Copy",

Install the Android agent Before you install the Android agent, make sure your app follows the compatibility requirements. As part of the installation process, mobile monitoring automatically generates an application token. This is a 40-character hexadecimal string for authenticating each mobile app that you monitor. Follow the Android installation and configuration procedures for your environment as applicable. If you have problems with your Android installation, or if you do not see data in the mobile monitoring UI for your Android app, follow the troubleshooting procedures. Extend your instrumentation After you install the agent, extend the agent's instrumentation by using the mobile monitoring UI and following up on information in New Relic Insights.

For more information, see the NewRelic.setUserId method. The Android agent provides an SDK API to set up custom instrumentation for monitoring your application. The API gives you the ability to: Instrument your own code. Create, name, and end interaction traces from events in your mobile app. Record custom metrics. Send custom attributes and events to New Relic Insights. Track networking from libraries not supported automatically. Install the SDK Before using the Android SDK API: Review the Android SDK API release notes to ensure you have your app instrumented with a current SDK for mobile monitoring. Go to one.newrelic.com, click Add more data and then follow the steps for Android. For more information, see the detailed Android installation and configuration procedures. If you need to support Android 2.2, see the legacy Android agent SDK procedures. Instrument your code Caution Tracing is heavily optimized, but it does impose a performance overhead. Avoid instrumenting methods that are expected to be called hundreds of times. If you have custom libraries or application code that you want to include in interaction traces: Use the following Java annotation: import com.newrelic.agent.android.instrumentation.Trace; Copy Add the @Trace annotation to the methods you want to instrument: @Trace public void myHeavyweightMethod() { … Copy To indicate what kind of method is being traced, use the optional category attribute.

      "body": "Important Starting with version 5.9.0 of the New Relic Android agent, you can set a custom user identifier value to associate user sessions with analytics events and attributes. For more information, see the NewRelic.setUserId method. The Android agent provides an SDK API to set up custom instrumentation for monitoring your application. The API gives you the ability to: Instrument your own code. Create, name, and end interaction traces from events in your mobile app. Record custom metrics. Send custom attributes and events to New Relic Insights. Track networking from libraries not supported automatically. Install the SDK Before using the Android SDK API: Review the Android SDK API release notes to ensure you have your app instrumented with a current SDK for mobile monitoring. Go to one.newrelic.com, click Add more data and then follow the steps for Android. For more information, see the detailed Android installation and configuration procedures. If you need to support Android 2.2, see the legacy Android agent SDK procedures. Instrument your code Caution Tracing is heavily optimized, but it does impose a performance overhead. Avoid instrumenting methods that are expected to be called hundreds of times. If you have custom libraries or application code that you want to include in interaction traces: Use the following Java annotation: import com.newrelic.agent.android.instrumentation.Trace; Copy Add the @Trace annotation to the methods you want to instrument: @Trace public void myHeavyweightMethod() { … Copy To indicate what kind of method is being traced, use the optional category attribute. Automatically instrumented methods Automatic instrumentation is one of the agent's more convenient features. However, if it interferes with the method being traced, add @SkipTrace to the method, and the agent will skip it during compile time instrumentation.

Name or rename an interaction See setInteractionName. End an interaction See endInteraction. Disable or enable all interactions See withInteractionTracing. Set an app version associated with an interaction See withApplicationVersion. Set custom build ID See withApplicationBuild. Create custom metrics See recordMetric. Report custom attributes and events There are several ways to add custom attributes and events. For more about which would be the best method to use and why, see Add custom data. Create an attribute: setAttribute Increment an attribute count: incrementAttribute Remove an attribute: removeAttribute Remove all attributes: removeAllAttributes Record custom event: recordCustomEvent Record a breadcrumb event: recordBreadcrumb Set the maximum size of an event pool: setMaxEventPoolSize Set maximum time agent stores events in memory: setMaxEventBufferTime Return the current session's ID: currentSessionId Set custom user ID for associating sessions with events and attributes: setUserId Track custom network requests and failures Use these methods: Record HTTP transactions at varying levels of detail: See noticeHttpTransaction. Record network failures: See noticeNetworkFailure. Record a handled exception as an event, including context See recordHandledException(). Manual cross application tracing The noticeHttpTransaction code does not automatically append the appropriate header ID value needed to get cross application tracing to work. This is why you will not see the application link in your Android app on New Relic's Map page for mobile apps or on the HTTP requests page. You can use a public method in the New Relic Android SDK to get the appropriate ID to pass along with your HTTP request to your back-end application, as long as it is already instrumented by New Relic. The appropriate header ID will be passed from the back-end application in the response, providing everything needed for cross application tracing to function. Cross application tracing example This example adds the NewRelic-ID to the back-end HTTP request, with conn as the external HTTP connection. (Notice the additional import.) import com.newrelic.agent.android.NewRelic; import com.newrelic.agent.android.Agent; //required for getCrossProcessId() ... ... //new method for appending the crossProcessID necessary for CAT in New Relic public static void setCrossProcessHeader(HttpURLConnection conn) { String crossProcessId = Agent.getCrossProcessId(); // API call into the agent for the X-NewRelic-ID if (crossProcessId != null) { conn.setRequestProperty(\"X-NewRelic-ID\", crossProcessId); } } Copy After adding the appropriate header to the request to the back-end app, the response from the app needs to be parsed for the X-Newrelic-App-Data header, and then added to the noticeHttpTransaction call as a string. For example: //NewRelic.noticeHttpTransaction(url, httpMethod, statusCode, startTimeMs, endTimeMs, bytesSent, bytesReceived, responseBody, params, response); //Where xNewRelicAppDataHeader is the value of the X-NewRelic-App-Data header NewRelic.noticeHttpTransaction(\"http://api.newrelic.com\", \"GET\", 200, System.nanoTime(), System.nanoTime(),100 ,100, \"Test\", new HashMap<String, String>(), xNewRelicAppDataHeader); Copy",

If you have previously installed the Android agent SDK for mobile monitoring, follow the steps before upgrading to the latest version with Gradle and Android Studio. Install your Android app As part of the installation process for mobile monitoring, New Relic automatically generates an application token. This is a 40-character hexadecimal string for authenticating each mobile app you monitor in New Relic. Go to one.newrelic.com > Mobile. If applicable: From the Mobile apps index, select Add a new app. From the Get started page, select Android as the platform for mobile monitoring. Type a meaningful name for your mobile app, and select Continue. Continue with the steps to configure mobile monitoring with Gradle and Android Studio. OR: To complete the configuration process for a new mobile app later: Go to one.newrelic.com > Mobile, then select See instructions next to your mobile app name. To upgrade an existing Android installation: Go to one.newrelic.com > Mobile > (select an app) > Settings > Installation. Configure with Gradle and Android Studio These procedures to configure your Android app with Gradle and Android Studio also appear on the Get started page in New Relic. Merge New Relic's mobile monitoring code in the Gradle & Android Studio tab to your build.gradle file. Project level build.gradle file: In this example, AGENT_VERSION represents your agent version number. See the agent release notes, and use the latest version. buildscript { repositories { mavenCentral() } dependencies { classpath \"com.newrelic.agent.android:agent-gradle-plugin:AGENT_VERSION\" } } Copy App level build.gradle file: In this example, AGENT_VERSION represents your agent version number. See the agent release notes, and use the latest version. repositories { mavenCentral() } apply plugin: 'android' apply plugin: 'newrelic' dependencies { compile 'com.newrelic.agent.android:android-agent:AGENT_VERSION' } Copy ProGuard or DexGuard: In your project’s root directory (projectname/app), add a newrelic.properties file with the following line: com.newrelic.application_token=GENERATED_TOKEN Copy Follow the additional, required configuration steps for using ProGuard or DexGuard with New Relic. Set app permissions: Ensure that your Android app requests INTERNET and ACCESS_NETWORK_STATE permissions by adding these lines to your AndroidManifest.xml file: <uses-permission android:name=\"android.permission.INTERNET\" /> <uses-permission android:name=\"android.permission.ACCESS_NETWORK_STATE\" /> Copy To start New Relic's mobile monitoring agent: In your Default Activity (as defined in your Manifest), import the NewRelic class: import com.newrelic.agent.android.NewRelic; Copy Important We do not support starting the mobile monitoring agent in other classes, as that can cause unexpected or unstable behavior. To initialize mobile monitoring: In the onCreate() method, add this call: NewRelic.withApplicationToken(\"GENERATED_TOKEN\").start(this.getApplication()); Copy Optional: Change the logging level. To build and run your application: Clean your project, then run your app in an emulator or device to generate traffic. Wait a few minutes, then view data for your Android app from the Overview page: Go to one.newrelic.com > Mobile > (select an app). If you have problems with your Android installation, or if you do not see data in the mobile monitoring UI, follow the troubleshooting procedures. Update your Android installation To keep your Android agent up to date, follow the procedures to upgrade the Android agent SDK for New Relic. To install the latest Android version for your mobile app: Go to one.newrelic.com > Mobile > (select an app) > Settings > Installation. Android 4.x: Multidex support New Relic's mobile monitoring for Android versions prior to Android 5.0 (API level 21) use the Dalvik runtime to execute app code. By default, Dalvik limits apps to a single classes.dex bytecode file per APK. In order to get around this limitation, you must enable multidex support. Then you can use the multidex support library, which becomes part of the primary DEX file of your app and then manages access to the additional DEX files and the code they contain. When building each DEX file for a multidex app, the build tools perform complex decision making to determine which classes are needed in the primary DEX file so that your app can start successfully. If any class required during startup is not provided in the primary DEX file, then your app crashes with the error java.lang.NoClassDefFoundError. If you see the java.lang.NoClassDefFoundError error, then you must manually specify these additional classes as required in the primary DEX file: Create a proguard.multidex.config file within the /app folder of your project. Update mypackage to reflect your package name. #################### # keep class names # #################### #Keep New Relic in the main dex -keep class com.newrelic.** { *; } -keep class com.mypackage.activities.** { *; } Copy Merge the following code into the app-level build.gradle file: android { defaultConfig{ … multiDexKeepProguard file(\"proguard.multidex.config\") } } Copy For more information, see the Android Developers documentation on declaring classes required in the primary DEX file.

      "body": "Important Starting with version 5.9.0 of the New Relic Android agent, you can set a custom user identifier value to associate user sessions with analytics events and attributes. For more information, see the NewRelic.setUserId method. The Android agent provides an SDK API to set up custom instrumentation for monitoring your application. The API gives you the ability to: Instrument your own code. Create, name, and end interaction traces from events in your mobile app. Record custom metrics. Send custom attributes and events to New Relic Insights. Track networking from libraries not supported automatically. Install the SDK Before using the Android SDK API: Review the Android SDK API release notes to ensure you have your app instrumented with a current SDK for mobile monitoring. Go to one.newrelic.com, click Add more data and then follow the steps for Android. For more information, see the detailed Android installation and configuration procedures. If you need to support Android 2.2, see the legacy Android agent SDK procedures. Instrument your code Caution Tracing is heavily optimized, but it does impose a performance overhead. Avoid instrumenting methods that are expected to be called hundreds of times. If you have custom libraries or application code that you want to include in interaction traces: Use the following Java annotation: import com.newrelic.agent.android.instrumentation.Trace; Copy Add the @Trace annotation to the methods you want to instrument: @Trace public void myHeavyweightMethod() { … Copy To indicate what kind of method is being traced, use the optional category attribute. Automatically instrumented methods Automatic instrumentation is one of the agent's more convenient features. However, if it interferes with the method being traced, add @SkipTrace to the method, and the agent will skip it during compile time instrumentation. Classes Methods Activity onCreate onCreateView AsyncTask execute executeOnExecutor BitmapFactory decodeFile decodeResourceStream decodeResource decodeByteArray decodeStream decodeFileDescriptor decodeResourceStream SQLiteDatabase query queryWithFactory rawQuery rawQueryWithFactory insert insertOrThrow insertWithOnConflict replace replaceOrThrow delete update updateWithOnConflict execSql GSON toJson fromJson JSONObject <init> toString JSONArray <init> toString Category attribute example The category can be a custom name, or it can be one of the predefined MetricCategory enums (listed below). Here is an example of instrumenting an image processing method using the predefined IMAGE category: @Trace(category = MetricCategory.IMAGE) public void processImageData() { … Copy Available MetricCategory enums include: MetricCategory Description VIEW_LOADING Creating sub views, controls, and other related tasks VIEW_LAYOUT Inflation of layouts, resolving components DATABASE SQLite and other file I/O IMAGE Image loading and processing JSON JSON parsing or creation NETWORK Web service integration methods, remote resource loading Use the API methods The following table lists all the New Relic Android SDK API calls, ordered by common use cases. If you want to... Do this Track app activity that may be helpful for troubleshooting crashes See recordBreadcrumb. Track a method as an interaction See startInteraction. Name or rename an interaction See setInteractionName. End an interaction See endInteraction. Disable or enable all interactions See withInteractionTracing. Set an app version associated with an interaction See withApplicationVersion. Set custom build ID See withApplicationBuild. Create custom metrics See recordMetric. Report custom attributes and events There are several ways to add custom attributes and events. For more about which would be the best method to use and why, see Add custom data. Create an attribute: setAttribute Increment an attribute count: incrementAttribute Remove an attribute: removeAttribute Remove all attributes: removeAllAttributes Record custom event: recordCustomEvent Record a breadcrumb event: recordBreadcrumb Set the maximum size of an event pool: setMaxEventPoolSize Set maximum time agent stores events in memory: setMaxEventBufferTime Return the current session's ID: currentSessionId Set custom user ID for associating sessions with events and attributes: setUserId Track custom network requests and failures Use these methods: Record HTTP transactions at varying levels of detail: See noticeHttpTransaction. Record network failures: See noticeNetworkFailure. Record a handled exception as an event, including context See recordHandledException(). Manual cross application tracing The noticeHttpTransaction code does not automatically append the appropriate header ID value needed to get cross application tracing to work. This is why you will not see the application link in your Android app on New Relic's Map page for mobile apps or on the HTTP requests page. You can use a public method in the New Relic Android SDK to get the appropriate ID to pass along with your HTTP request to your back-end application, as long as it is already instrumented by New Relic. The appropriate header ID will be passed from the back-end application in the response, providing everything needed for cross application tracing to function. Cross application tracing example This example adds the NewRelic-ID to the back-end HTTP request, with conn as the external HTTP connection. (Notice the additional import.) import com.newrelic.agent.android.NewRelic; import com.newrelic.agent.android.Agent; //required for getCrossProcessId() ... ... //new method for appending the crossProcessID necessary for CAT in New Relic public static void setCrossProcessHeader(HttpURLConnection conn) { String crossProcessId = Agent.getCrossProcessId(); // API call into the agent for the X-NewRelic-ID if (crossProcessId != null) { conn.setRequestProperty(\"X-NewRelic-ID\", crossProcessId); } } Copy After adding the appropriate header to the request to the back-end app, the response from the app needs to be parsed for the X-Newrelic-App-Data header, and then added to the noticeHttpTransaction call as a string. For example: //NewRelic.noticeHttpTransaction(url, httpMethod, statusCode, startTimeMs, endTimeMs, bytesSent, bytesReceived, responseBody, params, response); //Where xNewRelicAppDataHeader is the value of the X-NewRelic-App-Data header NewRelic.noticeHttpTransaction(\"http://api.newrelic.com\", \"GET\", 200, System.nanoTime(), System.nanoTime(),100 ,100, \"Test\", new HashMap<String, String>(), xNewRelicAppDataHeader); Copy",

If you have problems with your Android installation, or if you do not see data in the mobile monitoring UI for your Android app, follow the troubleshooting procedures. Extend your instrumentation After you install the agent, extend the agent's instrumentation by using the mobile monitoring UI and following up on information in New Relic Insights. To access: In mobile monitoring: In NRQL and dashboards: Custom data Create and record custom events, interaction traces, and attributes to add details to your existing data and traces. Then, view the custom events that you created in NRQL or dashboards. Network requests Enable the MobileRequest event feature so you can perform a full network analysis. To further investigate network request error rates and response times, query MobileRequest and MobileRequestError events. Crash analysis Review detailed information using groups and filters to analyze trends that lead to crashes. To view more information about crashes, create NRQL queries to review Insights charts related to crash data. Android SDK API Use the Android SDK API for mobile monitoring to instrument parts of your code that are not instrumented by default. Then, view those custom events and attributes in New Relic Insights. Handled exceptions Report exceptions so you can identify factors creating a poor mobile app experience. To further improve performance, review MobileHandledException event records in New Relic Insights. Breadcrumbs Boost the level of detail in crash event trails by adding breadcrumbs. Then, query MobileBreadcrumbs events to see all breadcrumbs or just breadcrumbs related to crashes.

If you have previously installed the Android agent SDK for mobile monitoring, follow the steps before upgrading to the latest version with Gradle and Android Studio. Install your Android app As part of the installation process for mobile monitoring, New Relic automatically generates an application token. This is a 40-character hexadecimal string for authenticating each mobile app you monitor in New Relic. Go to one.newrelic.com > Mobile. If applicable: From the Mobile apps index, select Add a new app. From the Get started page, select Android as the platform for mobile monitoring. Type a meaningful name for your mobile app, and select Continue. Continue with the steps to configure mobile monitoring with Gradle and Android Studio. OR: To complete the configuration process for a new mobile app later: Go to one.newrelic.com > Mobile, then select See instructions next to your mobile app name. To upgrade an existing Android installation: Go to one.newrelic.com > Mobile > (select an app) > Settings > Installation. Configure with Gradle and Android Studio These procedures to configure your Android app with Gradle and Android Studio also appear on the Get started page in New Relic. Merge New Relic's mobile monitoring code in the Gradle & Android Studio tab to your build.gradle file. Project level build.gradle file: In this example, AGENT_VERSION represents your agent version number. See the agent release notes, and use the latest version. buildscript { repositories { mavenCentral() } dependencies { classpath \"com.newrelic.agent.android:agent-gradle-plugin:AGENT_VERSION\" } } Copy App level build.gradle file: In this example, AGENT_VERSION represents your agent version number. See the agent release notes, and use the latest version. repositories { mavenCentral() } apply plugin: 'android' apply plugin: 'newrelic' dependencies { compile 'com.newrelic.agent.android:android-agent:AGENT_VERSION' } Copy ProGuard or DexGuard: In your project’s root directory (projectname/app), add a newrelic.properties file with the following line: com.newrelic.application_token=GENERATED_TOKEN Copy Follow the additional, required configuration steps for using ProGuard or DexGuard with New Relic. Set app permissions: Ensure that your Android app requests INTERNET and ACCESS_NETWORK_STATE permissions by adding these lines to your AndroidManifest.xml file: <uses-permission android:name=\"android.permission.INTERNET\" /> <uses-permission android:name=\"android.permission.ACCESS_NETWORK_STATE\" /> Copy To start New Relic's mobile monitoring agent: In your Default Activity (as defined in your Manifest), import the NewRelic class: import com.newrelic.agent.android.NewRelic; Copy Important We do not support starting the mobile monitoring agent in other classes, as that can cause unexpected or unstable behavior. To initialize mobile monitoring: In the onCreate() method, add this call: NewRelic.withApplicationToken(\"GENERATED_TOKEN\").start(this.getApplication()); Copy Optional: Change the logging level. To build and run your application: Clean your project, then run your app in an emulator or device to generate traffic. Wait a few minutes, then view data for your Android app from the Overview page: Go to one.newrelic.com > Mobile > (select an app). If you have problems with your Android installation, or if you do not see data in the mobile monitoring UI, follow the troubleshooting procedures. Update your Android installation To keep your Android agent up to date, follow the procedures to upgrade the Android agent SDK for New Relic. To install the latest Android version for your mobile app: Go to one.newrelic.com > Mobile > (select an app) > Settings > Installation. Android 4.x: Multidex support New Relic's mobile monitoring for Android versions prior to Android 5.0 (API level 21) use the Dalvik runtime to execute app code. By default, Dalvik limits apps to a single classes.dex bytecode file per APK. In order to get around this limitation, you must enable multidex support. Then you can use the multidex support library, which becomes part of the primary DEX file of your app and then manages access to the additional DEX files and the code they contain. When building each DEX file for a multidex app, the build tools perform complex decision making to determine which classes are needed in the primary DEX file so that your app can start successfully. If any class required during startup is not provided in the primary DEX file, then your app crashes with the error java.lang.NoClassDefFoundError. If you see the java.lang.NoClassDefFoundError error, then you must manually specify these additional classes as required in the primary DEX file: Create a proguard.multidex.config file within the /app folder of your project. Update mypackage to reflect your package name. #################### # keep class names # #################### #Keep New Relic in the main dex -keep class com.newrelic.** { *; } -keep class com.mypackage.activities.** { *; } Copy Merge the following code into the app-level build.gradle file: android { defaultConfig{ … multiDexKeepProguard file(\"proguard.multidex.config\") } } Copy For more information, see the Android Developers documentation on declaring classes required in the primary DEX file.

A trace observer is a cloud-based New Relic tool that decides what trace data to keep and send to New Relic. The trace observer lives in New Relic Edge, which is an AWS-based service that provides you with a low-latency and low-cost way to send your telemetry data to New Relic. The trace observer sends data via our Trace API, which is the entry point for all distributed trace data we ingest. Tip This documentation is for our Infinite Tracing feature. To learn about all our distributed tracing options, see Intro to distributed tracing. Set up the trace observer Before setting up a trace observer, understand these points: With the exception of the Trace API, these instructions are not standalone; they're part of larger enable procedures. If you're still figuring out what you need, see Enable distributed tracing. To avoid configuration conflict issues, you should ideally enable Infinite Tracing for all associated services. If some services in a trace have our standard distributed tracing enabled, you should upgrade those to Infinite Tracing. To set up a trace observer: Go to one.newrelic.com, and click Apps. Under Your apps, click New Relic Edge. Select an account in the upper-left dropdown. If you have access to multiple accounts, make sure you're in the account where you want Infinite Tracing enabled. If no trace observers are already present, click New trace observer to add one, fill out the information, and click Create. Important Note: If you select a trace observer in an EU region, you’ll still need a US-based New Relic account because data is reported to US data centers. Under the Endpoints dropdown: Copy the For other integrations endpoint value and have it ready: this will be referred to in later instructions as YOUR_TRACE_OBSERVER_URL. If you're enabling a language agent, also copy the For language agents value and have it ready: this will be referred to as YOUR_TRACE_OBSERVER_HOST. (Optional but recommended) To verify things are working, we recommend sending a sample trace payload. If you're using our Trace API: this step is especially recommended to learn how the API works. Send sample payload Important If you're using Zipkin-format data, see Send Zipkin payload. This test sends a sample trace payload with one trace and two spans from a service named Test Service A. To send this sample request: Get the license key for the account you want to report data to and have it ready. Copy the following curl request into a text editor: curl -i -H \"Content-Type: application/json\" \\ -H \"Api-Key: $YOUR_LICENSE_KEY\" \\ -H 'Data-Format: newrelic' \\ -H 'Data-Format-Version: 1' \\ -X POST \\ -d '[ { \"common\": { \"attributes\": { \"environment\": \"staging\" } }, \"spans\": [ { \"trace.id\": \"123456\", \"id\": \"ABC\", \"attributes\": { \"duration.ms\": 12.53, \"host\": \"host123.example.com\", \"name\": \"/home\", \"service.name\": \"Test Service A\" } }, { \"trace.id\": \"123456\", \"id\": \"DEF\", \"attributes\": { \"duration.ms\": 2.97, \"host\": \"host456.example.com\", \"error.message\": \"Invalid credentials\", \"name\": \"/auth\", \"parent.id\": \"ABC\", \"service.name\": \"Test Service B\" } } ] } ]' \\ '$YOUR_TRACE_OBSERVER_URL' Copy Insert your own values into the curl request: Value Description $YOUR_LICENSE_KEY Replace this with your license key. $YOUR_TRACE_OBSERVER_URL Replace this with the For other integrations endpoint value you copied in a previous step. Copy the curl request into a terminal and execute it. The test should return HTTP/1.1 202 Accepted, indicating success. If it does not, check the following common issues: Confirm that you used the For other integrations endpoint value. Confirm you're using single quotes around YOUR_TRACE_OBSERVER_URL. Check that you're using the correct API key. If your test returned HTTP/1.1 202 Accepted, go to the New Relic UI to see a query of the sample payload data using the span attribute service.name = Test Service A (here's a link for that query). Because the sample payload contains an error attribute, the error sampler will mark it for keeping. If you modify the payload to remove the error attributes, the random sampler may not choose to keep this particular trace. Tip Traces may take up to one minute to show up in the UI. (Optional) There are several ways to configure Infinite Tracing. This configuration can wait until after you've completed the enable procedures. This procedure is complete. Next, return to finish any remaining instructions for the tracing tool you started enabling: Language agents Third-party telemetry integrations (OpenTelemetry and others) Trace API: once the trace observer is set up, you're finished and can start instrumenting your application. Trace observer endpoints In the trace observer UI, there's an Endpoints dropdown. When setting up the trace observer, we have you copy these values for use at various points of our tracing tool setup instructions. There are two values: For language agents: This value is referenced in our code examples as YOUR_TRACE_OBSERVER_HOST. This is used for configuring our language agents to send data to the trace observer. For other integrations: This value is referenced in our code examples as YOUR_TRACE_OBSERVER_URL. This is used for configuring our telemetry integrations and for sending data via the Trace API (including sending sample payloads).",

If you have previously installed the Android agent SDK for mobile monitoring, follow the steps before upgrading to the latest version with Gradle and Android Studio. Install your Android app As part of the installation process for mobile monitoring, New Relic automatically generates an application token. This is a 40-character hexadecimal string for authenticating each mobile app you monitor in New Relic. Go to one.newrelic.com > Mobile. If applicable: From the Mobile apps index, select Add a new app. From the Get started page, select Android as the platform for mobile monitoring. Type a meaningful name for your mobile app, and select Continue. Continue with the steps to configure mobile monitoring with Gradle and Android Studio. OR: To complete the configuration process for a new mobile app later: Go to one.newrelic.com > Mobile, then select See instructions next to your mobile app name. To upgrade an existing Android installation: Go to one.newrelic.com > Mobile > (select an app) > Settings > Installation. Configure with Gradle and Android Studio These procedures to configure your Android app with Gradle and Android Studio also appear on the Get started page in New Relic. Merge New Relic's mobile monitoring code in the Gradle & Android Studio tab to your build.gradle file. Project level build.gradle file: In this example, AGENT_VERSION represents your agent version number. See the agent release notes, and use the latest version. buildscript { repositories { mavenCentral() } dependencies { classpath \"com.newrelic.agent.android:agent-gradle-plugin:AGENT_VERSION\" } } Copy App level build.gradle file: In this example, AGENT_VERSION represents your agent version number. See the agent release notes, and use the latest version. repositories { mavenCentral() } apply plugin: 'android' apply plugin: 'newrelic' dependencies { compile 'com.newrelic.agent.android:android-agent:AGENT_VERSION' } Copy ProGuard or DexGuard: In your project’s root directory (projectname/app), add a newrelic.properties file with the following line: com.newrelic.application_token=GENERATED_TOKEN Copy Follow the additional, required configuration steps for using ProGuard or DexGuard with New Relic. Set app permissions: Ensure that your Android app requests INTERNET and ACCESS_NETWORK_STATE permissions by adding these lines to your AndroidManifest.xml file: <uses-permission android:name=\"android.permission.INTERNET\" /> <uses-permission android:name=\"android.permission.ACCESS_NETWORK_STATE\" /> Copy To start New Relic's mobile monitoring agent: In your Default Activity (as defined in your Manifest), import the NewRelic class: import com.newrelic.agent.android.NewRelic; Copy Important We do not support starting the mobile monitoring agent in other classes, as that can cause unexpected or unstable behavior. To initialize mobile monitoring: In the onCreate() method, add this call: NewRelic.withApplicationToken(\"GENERATED_TOKEN\").start(this.getApplication()); Copy Optional: Change the logging level. To build and run your application: Clean your project, then run your app in an emulator or device to generate traffic. Wait a few minutes, then view data for your Android app from the Overview page: Go to one.newrelic.com > Mobile > (select an app). If you have problems with your Android installation, or if you do not see data in the mobile monitoring UI, follow the troubleshooting procedures. Update your Android installation To keep your Android agent up to date, follow the procedures to upgrade the Android agent SDK for New Relic. To install the latest Android version for your mobile app: Go to one.newrelic.com > Mobile > (select an app) > Settings > Installation. Android 4.x: Multidex support New Relic's mobile monitoring for Android versions prior to Android 5.0 (API level 21) use the Dalvik runtime to execute app code. By default, Dalvik limits apps to a single classes.dex bytecode file per APK. In order to get around this limitation, you must enable multidex support. Then you can use the multidex support library, which becomes part of the primary DEX file of your app and then manages access to the additional DEX files and the code they contain. When building each DEX file for a multidex app, the build tools perform complex decision making to determine which classes are needed in the primary DEX file so that your app can start successfully. If any class required during startup is not provided in the primary DEX file, then your app crashes with the error java.lang.NoClassDefFoundError. If you see the java.lang.NoClassDefFoundError error, then you must manually specify these additional classes as required in the primary DEX file: Create a proguard.multidex.config file within the /app folder of your project. Update mypackage to reflect your package name. #################### # keep class names # #################### #Keep New Relic in the main dex -keep class com.newrelic.** { *; } -keep class com.mypackage.activities.** { *; } Copy Merge the following code into the app-level build.gradle file: android { defaultConfig{ … multiDexKeepProguard file(\"proguard.multidex.config\") } } Copy For more information, see the Android Developers documentation on declaring classes required in the primary DEX file.

If you have previously installed the Android agent SDK for mobile monitoring, follow the steps before upgrading to the latest version with Gradle and Android Studio. Install your Android app As part of the installation process for mobile monitoring, New Relic automatically generates an application token. This is a 40-character hexadecimal string for authenticating each mobile app you monitor in New Relic. Go to one.newrelic.com > Mobile. If applicable: From the Mobile apps index, select Add a new app. From the Get started page, select Android as the platform for mobile monitoring. Type a meaningful name for your mobile app, and select Continue. Continue with the steps to configure mobile monitoring with Gradle and Android Studio. OR: To complete the configuration process for a new mobile app later: Go to one.newrelic.com > Mobile, then select See instructions next to your mobile app name. To upgrade an existing Android installation: Go to one.newrelic.com > Mobile > (select an app) > Settings > Installation. Configure with Gradle and Android Studio These procedures to configure your Android app with Gradle and Android Studio also appear on the Get started page in New Relic. Merge New Relic's mobile monitoring code in the Gradle & Android Studio tab to your build.gradle file. Project level build.gradle file: In this example, AGENT_VERSION represents your agent version number. See the agent release notes, and use the latest version. buildscript { repositories { mavenCentral() } dependencies { classpath \"com.newrelic.agent.android:agent-gradle-plugin:AGENT_VERSION\" } } Copy App level build.gradle file: In this example, AGENT_VERSION represents your agent version number. See the agent release notes, and use the latest version. repositories { mavenCentral() } apply plugin: 'android' apply plugin: 'newrelic' dependencies { compile 'com.newrelic.agent.android:android-agent:AGENT_VERSION' } Copy ProGuard or DexGuard: In your project’s root directory (projectname/app), add a newrelic.properties file with the following line: com.newrelic.application_token=GENERATED_TOKEN Copy Follow the additional, required configuration steps for using ProGuard or DexGuard with New Relic. Set app permissions: Ensure that your Android app requests INTERNET and ACCESS_NETWORK_STATE permissions by adding these lines to your AndroidManifest.xml file: <uses-permission android:name=\"android.permission.INTERNET\" /> <uses-permission android:name=\"android.permission.ACCESS_NETWORK_STATE\" /> Copy To start New Relic's mobile monitoring agent: In your Default Activity (as defined in your Manifest), import the NewRelic class: import com.newrelic.agent.android.NewRelic; Copy Important We do not support starting the mobile monitoring agent in other classes, as that can cause unexpected or unstable behavior. To initialize mobile monitoring: In the onCreate() method, add this call: NewRelic.withApplicationToken(\"GENERATED_TOKEN\").start(this.getApplication()); Copy Optional: Change the logging level. To build and run your application: Clean your project, then run your app in an emulator or device to generate traffic. Wait a few minutes, then view data for your Android app from the Overview page: Go to one.newrelic.com > Mobile > (select an app). If you have problems with your Android installation, or if you do not see data in the mobile monitoring UI, follow the troubleshooting procedures. Update your Android installation To keep your Android agent up to date, follow the procedures to upgrade the Android agent SDK for New Relic. To install the latest Android version for your mobile app: Go to one.newrelic.com > Mobile > (select an app) > Settings > Installation. Android 4.x: Multidex support New Relic's mobile monitoring for Android versions prior to Android 5.0 (API level 21) use the Dalvik runtime to execute app code. By default, Dalvik limits apps to a single classes.dex bytecode file per APK. In order to get around this limitation, you must enable multidex support. Then you can use the multidex support library, which becomes part of the primary DEX file of your app and then manages access to the additional DEX files and the code they contain. When building each DEX file for a multidex app, the build tools perform complex decision making to determine which classes are needed in the primary DEX file so that your app can start successfully. If any class required during startup is not provided in the primary DEX file, then your app crashes with the error java.lang.NoClassDefFoundError. If you see the java.lang.NoClassDefFoundError error, then you must manually specify these additional classes as required in the primary DEX file: Create a proguard.multidex.config file within the /app folder of your project. Update mypackage to reflect your package name. #################### # keep class names # #################### #Keep New Relic in the main dex -keep class com.newrelic.** { *; } -keep class com.mypackage.activities.** { *; } Copy Merge the following code into the app-level build.gradle file: android { defaultConfig{ … multiDexKeepProguard file(\"proguard.multidex.config\") } } Copy For more information, see the Android Developers documentation on declaring classes required in the primary DEX file.

Check our Android compatibility and requirements, and if you have previously installed the Android agent SDK, follow the steps before upgrading to the latest version with ProGuard or DexGuard. Configure ProGuard To add support for ProGuard: Add an exclusion to your app; for example: To support New Relic instrumentation, add keep class. To disable warnings related to unresolved problems, add dont warn. To preserve line numbers for crash reporting, add LineNumberTable. To preserve stack information for handled exceptions, add SourceFile and EnclosingMethod. Add the following to your ProGuard config file (proguard.cfg, proguard-android.txt, proguard-rules.pro, etc.): -keep class com.newrelic.** { *; } -dontwarn com.newrelic.** -keepattributes Exceptions, Signature, InnerClasses, LineNumberTable, SourceFile, EnclosingMethod Copy Clean and rebuild your project. Run your app in an emulator or device to start seeing data on your mobile app's Overview page. Optional: Use the mobile monitoring Settings page to customize your mobile app. If no data appears, review your logcat output for errors. Network library support New Relic instrumentation happens before ProGuard obfuscates your code. In order for these libraries to be properly instrumented, their classes must not be obfuscated by ProGuard. Here are examples of rules to be applied to preserve these classes. This is not a complete list. Different rules will be needed depending on your library or version. Library Rules Apache Http -keep class org.apache.http.** { *; } -dontwarn org.apache.http.** Copy OkHttp 2 -keep class com.squareup.okhttp.* { *; } -dontwarn com.squareup.okhttp.** -dontwarn okio.** Copy OkHttp 3 -keep class okhttp3.** { *; } -dontwarn okhttp3.** -dontwarn okio.** Copy Retrofit 2 -keep class retrofit2.** { *; } -dontwarn retrofit2.** Copy Configure DexGuard DexGuard uses the same configuration options as ProGuard, and it can read any pre-existing ProGuard configuration files. DexGuard also has its own set of additional configuration options and provides sample configurations for many common app frameworks. To add support for DexGuard: Add DexGuard to your app and set up the Gradle plugin according to the directions from DexGuard. Create a dexguard-project.txt file to hold specific DexGuard configuration options, and add: -dontnote com.newrelic.agent.android.NewRelic -dontnote com.newrelic.agent.android.harvest.crash.Crash Copy After the DexGuard plugin has been configured, check the following. DexGuard 8.x: verify that your app's buildTypes configuration is similar to this: buildTypes { release { minifyEnabled true proguardFile getDefaultDexGuardFile('dexguard-release.pro') proguardFile 'proguard-rules.pro' proguardFile 'dexguard-project.txt' } ...

With the Android agent version 5.17.0 and higher, you can use New Relic to detect and instrument all feature modules for an instant app. Use this documentation along with the standard New Relic procedures to install Android apps with Gradle and Android Studio. After following the standard installation procedures, follow these additional steps for Android instant apps. Terminology This procedure uses the following terms that are specific to the Android Instant Apps plugin: Module: Any packaged class and/or resource collection APK: A module that packages the apps resources and DEX’ed classes Feature module: A slimmed down module that contains only a subset of the total APK Install the plugin To install the New Relic plugin for Android Instant Apps: First follow the steps in the Install Android apps with Gradle and Android Studio documentation. Apply the agent plugin in every project Gradle build file. List the Android agent as a dependency.

Instrumentation When instrumenting an instant app, be aware of the following considerations with APKs: Instant apps and APKs Comments Instrumentation Instrumentation of instant apps behaves the same as instrumentation with a normal APK. The agent will detect when an APK is an instant app. For feature APKs, the agent will inject a unique build ID that instant apps will use when reporting crashes. The side-loaded (main) activity of every feature must call NewRelic.start() when the activity is created (as per normal instructions). ProGuard and Dexguard support for feature and application APKs Place the newrelic.properties file in the root (main) directory of the project. ProGuard and Dexguard support The Android Studio Gradle plugin will obfuscate any build configuration where minifyEnabled is set to true. In these conditions, the New Relic agent will forward the ProGuard map generated for the build to crash collectors, tagged with a unique build ID generated by the agent. Obfuscation is best configured in the application or instant app project that includes other modules as dependencies. Modules may configure ProGuard as needed. Important When using ProGuard or DexGuard with Android apps, follow the procedures to complete the additional, required configuration steps. For more information, see the ProGuard and DexGuard configuration documentation. Troubleshoot auto-instrumentation If you are not whether the agent is auto-instrumenting an instant app project, try running these steps: Build app with debug (-d, --debug) option, and capture the build log.

Check our Android compatibility and requirements, and if you have previously installed the Android agent SDK, follow the steps before upgrading to the latest version with ProGuard or DexGuard. Configure ProGuard To add support for ProGuard: Add an exclusion to your app; for example: To support New Relic instrumentation, add keep class. To disable warnings related to unresolved problems, add dont warn. To preserve line numbers for crash reporting, add LineNumberTable. To preserve stack information for handled exceptions, add SourceFile and EnclosingMethod. Add the following to your ProGuard config file (proguard.cfg, proguard-android.txt, proguard-rules.pro, etc.): -keep class com.newrelic.** { *; } -dontwarn com.newrelic.** -keepattributes Exceptions, Signature, InnerClasses, LineNumberTable, SourceFile, EnclosingMethod Copy Clean and rebuild your project. Run your app in an emulator or device to start seeing data on your mobile app's Overview page. Optional: Use the mobile monitoring Settings page to customize your mobile app. If no data appears, review your logcat output for errors. Network library support New Relic instrumentation happens before ProGuard obfuscates your code. In order for these libraries to be properly instrumented, their classes must not be obfuscated by ProGuard. Here are examples of rules to be applied to preserve these classes. This is not a complete list. Different rules will be needed depending on your library or version. Library Rules Apache Http -keep class org.apache.http.** { *; } -dontwarn org.apache.http.** Copy OkHttp 2 -keep class com.squareup.okhttp.* { *; } -dontwarn com.squareup.okhttp.** -dontwarn okio.** Copy OkHttp 3 -keep class okhttp3.** { *; } -dontwarn okhttp3.** -dontwarn okio.** Copy Retrofit 2 -keep class retrofit2.** { *; } -dontwarn retrofit2.** Copy Configure DexGuard DexGuard uses the same configuration options as ProGuard, and it can read any pre-existing ProGuard configuration files. DexGuard also has its own set of additional configuration options and provides sample configurations for many common app frameworks. To add support for DexGuard: Add DexGuard to your app and set up the Gradle plugin according to the directions from DexGuard. Create a dexguard-project.txt file to hold specific DexGuard configuration options, and add: -dontnote com.newrelic.agent.android.NewRelic -dontnote com.newrelic.agent.android.harvest.crash.Crash Copy After the DexGuard plugin has been configured, check the following.

If you have previously installed the Android agent SDK for mobile monitoring, follow the steps before upgrading to the latest version with Gradle and Android Studio. Install your Android app As part of the installation process for mobile monitoring, New Relic automatically generates an application token. This is a 40-character hexadecimal string for authenticating each mobile app you monitor in New Relic. Go to one.newrelic.com > Mobile. If applicable: From the Mobile apps index, select Add a new app. From the Get started page, select Android as the platform for mobile monitoring. Type a meaningful name for your mobile app, and select Continue. Continue with the steps to configure mobile monitoring with Gradle and Android Studio. OR: To complete the configuration process for a new mobile app later: Go to one.newrelic.com > Mobile, then select See instructions next to your mobile app name. To upgrade an existing Android installation: Go to one.newrelic.com > Mobile > (select an app) > Settings > Installation. Configure with Gradle and Android Studio These procedures to configure your Android app with Gradle and Android Studio also appear on the Get started page in New Relic. Merge New Relic's mobile monitoring code in the Gradle & Android Studio tab to your build.gradle file. Project level build.gradle file: In this example, AGENT_VERSION represents your agent version number. See the agent release notes, and use the latest version. buildscript { repositories { mavenCentral() } dependencies { classpath \"com.newrelic.agent.android:agent-gradle-plugin:AGENT_VERSION\" } } Copy App level build.gradle file: In this example, AGENT_VERSION represents your agent version number. See the agent release notes, and use the latest version. repositories { mavenCentral() } apply plugin: 'android' apply plugin: 'newrelic' dependencies { compile 'com.newrelic.agent.android:android-agent:AGENT_VERSION' } Copy ProGuard or DexGuard: In your project’s root directory (projectname/app), add a newrelic.properties file with the following line: com.newrelic.application_token=GENERATED_TOKEN Copy Follow the additional, required configuration steps for using ProGuard or DexGuard with New Relic. Set app permissions: Ensure that your Android app requests INTERNET and ACCESS_NETWORK_STATE permissions by adding these lines to your AndroidManifest.xml file: <uses-permission android:name=\"android.permission.INTERNET\" /> <uses-permission android:name=\"android.permission.ACCESS_NETWORK_STATE\" /> Copy To start New Relic's mobile monitoring agent: In your Default Activity (as defined in your Manifest), import the NewRelic class: import com.newrelic.agent.android.NewRelic; Copy Important We do not support starting the mobile monitoring agent in other classes, as that can cause unexpected or unstable behavior. To initialize mobile monitoring: In the onCreate() method, add this call: NewRelic.withApplicationToken(\"GENERATED_TOKEN\").start(this.getApplication()); Copy Optional: Change the logging level. To build and run your application: Clean your project, then run your app in an emulator or device to generate traffic. Wait a few minutes, then view data for your Android app from the Overview page: Go to one.newrelic.com > Mobile > (select an app). If you have problems with your Android installation, or if you do not see data in the mobile monitoring UI, follow the troubleshooting procedures. Update your Android installation To keep your Android agent up to date, follow the procedures to upgrade the Android agent SDK for New Relic. To install the latest Android version for your mobile app: Go to one.newrelic.com > Mobile > (select an app) > Settings > Installation. Android 4.x: Multidex support New Relic's mobile monitoring for Android versions prior to Android 5.0 (API level 21) use the Dalvik runtime to execute app code. By default, Dalvik limits apps to a single classes.dex bytecode file per APK. In order to get around this limitation, you must enable multidex support. Then you can use the multidex support library, which becomes part of the primary DEX file of your app and then manages access to the additional DEX files and the code they contain. When building each DEX file for a multidex app, the build tools perform complex decision making to determine which classes are needed in the primary DEX file so that your app can start successfully. If any class required during startup is not provided in the primary DEX file, then your app crashes with the error java.lang.NoClassDefFoundError. If you see the java.lang.NoClassDefFoundError error, then you must manually specify these additional classes as required in the primary DEX file: Create a proguard.multidex.config file within the /app folder of your project. Update mypackage to reflect your package name. #################### # keep class names # #################### #Keep New Relic in the main dex -keep class com.newrelic.** { *; } -keep class com.mypackage.activities.** { *; } Copy Merge the following code into the app-level build.gradle file: android { defaultConfig{ … multiDexKeepProguard file(\"proguard.multidex.config\") } } Copy For more information, see the Android Developers documentation on declaring classes required in the primary DEX file.

Check our Android compatibility and requirements, and if you have previously installed the Android agent SDK, follow the steps before upgrading to the latest version with ProGuard or DexGuard. Configure ProGuard To add support for ProGuard: Add an exclusion to your app; for example: To support New Relic instrumentation, add keep class. To disable warnings related to unresolved problems, add dont warn. To preserve line numbers for crash reporting, add LineNumberTable. To preserve stack information for handled exceptions, add SourceFile and EnclosingMethod. Add the following to your ProGuard config file (proguard.cfg, proguard-android.txt, proguard-rules.pro, etc.): -keep class com.newrelic.** { *; } -dontwarn com.newrelic.** -keepattributes Exceptions, Signature, InnerClasses, LineNumberTable, SourceFile, EnclosingMethod Copy Clean and rebuild your project.

If you have previously installed the Android agent SDK for mobile monitoring, follow the steps before upgrading to the latest version with Gradle and Android Studio. Install your Android app As part of the installation process for mobile monitoring, New Relic automatically generates an application token. This is a 40-character hexadecimal string for authenticating each mobile app you monitor in New Relic. Go to one.newrelic.com > Mobile. If applicable: From the Mobile apps index, select Add a new app. From the Get started page, select Android as the platform for mobile monitoring. Type a meaningful name for your mobile app, and select Continue. Continue with the steps to configure mobile monitoring with Gradle and Android Studio. OR: To complete the configuration process for a new mobile app later: Go to one.newrelic.com > Mobile, then select See instructions next to your mobile app name. To upgrade an existing Android installation: Go to one.newrelic.com > Mobile > (select an app) > Settings > Installation. Configure with Gradle and Android Studio These procedures to configure your Android app with Gradle and Android Studio also appear on the Get started page in New Relic. Merge New Relic's mobile monitoring code in the Gradle & Android Studio tab to your build.gradle file. Project level build.gradle file: In this example, AGENT_VERSION represents your agent version number. See the agent release notes, and use the latest version. buildscript { repositories { mavenCentral() } dependencies { classpath \"com.newrelic.agent.android:agent-gradle-plugin:AGENT_VERSION\" } } Copy App level build.gradle file: In this example, AGENT_VERSION represents your agent version number. See the agent release notes, and use the latest version. repositories { mavenCentral() } apply plugin: 'android' apply plugin: 'newrelic' dependencies { compile 'com.newrelic.agent.android:android-agent:AGENT_VERSION' } Copy ProGuard or DexGuard: In your project’s root directory (projectname/app), add a newrelic.properties file with the following line: com.newrelic.application_token=GENERATED_TOKEN Copy Follow the additional, required configuration steps for using ProGuard or DexGuard with New Relic. Set app permissions: Ensure that your Android app requests INTERNET and ACCESS_NETWORK_STATE permissions by adding these lines to your AndroidManifest.xml file: <uses-permission android:name=\"android.permission.INTERNET\" /> <uses-permission android:name=\"android.permission.ACCESS_NETWORK_STATE\" /> Copy To start New Relic's mobile monitoring agent: In your Default Activity (as defined in your Manifest), import the NewRelic class: import com.newrelic.agent.android.NewRelic; Copy Important We do not support starting the mobile monitoring agent in other classes, as that can cause unexpected or unstable behavior. To initialize mobile monitoring: In the onCreate() method, add this call: NewRelic.withApplicationToken(\"GENERATED_TOKEN\").start(this.getApplication()); Copy Optional: Change the logging level. To build and run your application: Clean your project, then run your app in an emulator or device to generate traffic. Wait a few minutes, then view data for your Android app from the Overview page: Go to one.newrelic.com > Mobile > (select an app). If you have problems with your Android installation, or if you do not see data in the mobile monitoring UI, follow the troubleshooting procedures. Update your Android installation To keep your Android agent up to date, follow the procedures to upgrade the Android agent SDK for New Relic. To install the latest Android version for your mobile app: Go to one.newrelic.com > Mobile > (select an app) > Settings > Installation. Android 4.x: Multidex support New Relic's mobile monitoring for Android versions prior to Android 5.0 (API level 21) use the Dalvik runtime to execute app code. By default, Dalvik limits apps to a single classes.dex bytecode file per APK. In order to get around this limitation, you must enable multidex support. Then you can use the multidex support library, which becomes part of the primary DEX file of your app and then manages access to the additional DEX files and the code they contain. When building each DEX file for a multidex app, the build tools perform complex decision making to determine which classes are needed in the primary DEX file so that your app can start successfully. If any class required during startup is not provided in the primary DEX file, then your app crashes with the error java.lang.NoClassDefFoundError. If you see the java.lang.NoClassDefFoundError error, then you must manually specify these additional classes as required in the primary DEX file: Create a proguard.multidex.config file within the /app folder of your project. Update mypackage to reflect your package name. #################### # keep class names # #################### #Keep New Relic in the main dex -keep class com.newrelic.** { *; } -keep class com.mypackage.activities.** { *; } Copy Merge the following code into the app-level build.gradle file: android { defaultConfig{ … multiDexKeepProguard file(\"proguard.multidex.config\") } } Copy For more information, see the Android Developers documentation on declaring classes required in the primary DEX file.

      "body": "Android Instant Apps allow users to quickly use your applications without installation. With the Android agent version 5.17.0 and higher, you can use New Relic to detect and instrument all feature modules for an instant app. Use this documentation along with the standard New Relic procedures to install Android apps with Gradle and Android Studio. After following the standard installation procedures, follow these additional steps for Android instant apps. Terminology This procedure uses the following terms that are specific to the Android Instant Apps plugin: Module: Any packaged class and/or resource collection APK: A module that packages the apps resources and DEX’ed classes Feature module: A slimmed down module that contains only a subset of the total APK Install the plugin To install the New Relic plugin for Android Instant Apps: First follow the steps in the Install Android apps with Gradle and Android Studio documentation. Apply the agent plugin in every project Gradle build file. List the Android agent as a dependency. Start the agent from each Activity class in the feature that could be side-loaded through a Digital Asset Link intent, (for example, mobile.example.com/signin). Minimal build.gradle example apply plugin: ‘com.android.[application|library|feature|instantapp]' apply plugin: ‘newrelic’ dependencies { implementation \"com.newrelic.agent.android:android-agent:${project.agentVersion}\" } Copy Review the considerations for instrumentation. Instrumentation When instrumenting an instant app, be aware of the following considerations with APKs: Instant apps and APKs Comments Instrumentation Instrumentation of instant apps behaves the same as instrumentation with a normal APK. The agent will detect when an APK is an instant app. For feature APKs, the agent will inject a unique build ID that instant apps will use when reporting crashes. The side-loaded (main) activity of every feature must call NewRelic.start() when the activity is created (as per normal instructions). ProGuard and Dexguard support for feature and application APKs Place the newrelic.properties file in the root (main) directory of the project. ProGuard and Dexguard support The Android Studio Gradle plugin will obfuscate any build configuration where minifyEnabled is set to true. In these conditions, the New Relic agent will forward the ProGuard map generated for the build to crash collectors, tagged with a unique build ID generated by the agent. Obfuscation is best configured in the application or instant app project that includes other modules as dependencies. Modules may configure ProGuard as needed. Important When using ProGuard or DexGuard with Android apps, follow the procedures to complete the additional, required configuration steps. For more information, see the ProGuard and DexGuard configuration documentation. Troubleshoot auto-instrumentation If you are not whether the agent is auto-instrumenting an instant app project, try running these steps: Build app with debug (-d, --debug) option, and capture the build log. Search the log for evidence of instant apps by looking for either of these terms: This appears to be an Instant App Copy BuildId[1a2b34c5-def6-7890-g123-h4567890a] Copy The agent will add an attribute named 'instantApp' to the app's Insights session attributes if the app appears to be an instant app.",

      "body": "Important Starting with version 5.9.0 of the New Relic Android agent, you can set a custom user identifier value to associate user sessions with analytics events and attributes. For more information, see the NewRelic.setUserId method. The Android agent provides an SDK API to set up custom instrumentation for monitoring your application. The API gives you the ability to: Instrument your own code. Create, name, and end interaction traces from events in your mobile app. Record custom metrics. Send custom attributes and events to New Relic Insights. Track networking from libraries not supported automatically. Install the SDK Before using the Android SDK API: Review the Android SDK API release notes to ensure you have your app instrumented with a current SDK for mobile monitoring. Go to one.newrelic.com, click Add more data and then follow the steps for Android. For more information, see the detailed Android installation and configuration procedures. If you need to support Android 2.2, see the legacy Android agent SDK procedures. Instrument your code Caution Tracing is heavily optimized, but it does impose a performance overhead. Avoid instrumenting methods that are expected to be called hundreds of times. If you have custom libraries or application code that you want to include in interaction traces: Use the following Java annotation: import com.newrelic.agent.android.instrumentation.Trace; Copy Add the @Trace annotation to the methods you want to instrument: @Trace public void myHeavyweightMethod() { … Copy To indicate what kind of method is being traced, use the optional category attribute. Automatically instrumented methods Automatic instrumentation is one of the agent's more convenient features. However, if it interferes with the method being traced, add @SkipTrace to the method, and the agent will skip it during compile time instrumentation. Classes Methods Activity onCreate onCreateView AsyncTask execute executeOnExecutor BitmapFactory decodeFile decodeResourceStream decodeResource decodeByteArray decodeStream decodeFileDescriptor decodeResourceStream SQLiteDatabase query queryWithFactory rawQuery rawQueryWithFactory insert insertOrThrow insertWithOnConflict replace replaceOrThrow delete update updateWithOnConflict execSql GSON toJson fromJson JSONObject <init> toString JSONArray <init> toString Category attribute example The category can be a custom name, or it can be one of the predefined MetricCategory enums (listed below). Here is an example of instrumenting an image processing method using the predefined IMAGE category: @Trace(category = MetricCategory.IMAGE) public void processImageData() { … Copy Available MetricCategory enums include: MetricCategory Description VIEW_LOADING Creating sub views, controls, and other related tasks VIEW_LAYOUT Inflation of layouts, resolving components DATABASE SQLite and other file I/O IMAGE Image loading and processing JSON JSON parsing or creation NETWORK Web service integration methods, remote resource loading Use the API methods The following table lists all the New Relic Android SDK API calls, ordered by common use cases. If you want to... Do this Track app activity that may be helpful for troubleshooting crashes See recordBreadcrumb. Track a method as an interaction See startInteraction. Name or rename an interaction See setInteractionName. End an interaction See endInteraction. Disable or enable all interactions See withInteractionTracing. Set an app version associated with an interaction See withApplicationVersion. Set custom build ID See withApplicationBuild. Create custom metrics See recordMetric. Report custom attributes and events There are several ways to add custom attributes and events. For more about which would be the best method to use and why, see Add custom data. Create an attribute: setAttribute Increment an attribute count: incrementAttribute Remove an attribute: removeAttribute Remove all attributes: removeAllAttributes Record custom event: recordCustomEvent Record a breadcrumb event: recordBreadcrumb Set the maximum size of an event pool: setMaxEventPoolSize Set maximum time agent stores events in memory: setMaxEventBufferTime Return the current session's ID: currentSessionId Set custom user ID for associating sessions with events and attributes: setUserId Track custom network requests and failures Use these methods: Record HTTP transactions at varying levels of detail: See noticeHttpTransaction. Record network failures: See noticeNetworkFailure. Record a handled exception as an event, including context See recordHandledException(). Manual cross application tracing The noticeHttpTransaction code does not automatically append the appropriate header ID value needed to get cross application tracing to work. This is why you will not see the application link in your Android app on New Relic's Map page for mobile apps or on the HTTP requests page. You can use a public method in the New Relic Android SDK to get the appropriate ID to pass along with your HTTP request to your back-end application, as long as it is already instrumented by New Relic. The appropriate header ID will be passed from the back-end application in the response, providing everything needed for cross application tracing to function. Cross application tracing example This example adds the NewRelic-ID to the back-end HTTP request, with conn as the external HTTP connection. (Notice the additional import.) import com.newrelic.agent.android.NewRelic; import com.newrelic.agent.android.Agent; //required for getCrossProcessId() ... ... //new method for appending the crossProcessID necessary for CAT in New Relic public static void setCrossProcessHeader(HttpURLConnection conn) { String crossProcessId = Agent.getCrossProcessId(); // API call into the agent for the X-NewRelic-ID if (crossProcessId != null) { conn.setRequestProperty(\"X-NewRelic-ID\", crossProcessId); } } Copy After adding the appropriate header to the request to the back-end app, the response from the app needs to be parsed for the X-Newrelic-App-Data header, and then added to the noticeHttpTransaction call as a string. For example: //NewRelic.noticeHttpTransaction(url, httpMethod, statusCode, startTimeMs, endTimeMs, bytesSent, bytesReceived, responseBody, params, response); //Where xNewRelicAppDataHeader is the value of the X-NewRelic-App-Data header NewRelic.noticeHttpTransaction(\"http://api.newrelic.com\", \"GET\", 200, System.nanoTime(), System.nanoTime(),100 ,100, \"Test\", new HashMap<String, String>(), xNewRelicAppDataHeader); Copy",

If you have problems with your Android installation, or if you do not see data in the mobile monitoring UI for your Android app, follow the troubleshooting procedures. Extend your instrumentation After you install the agent, extend the agent's instrumentation by using the mobile monitoring UI and following up on information in New Relic Insights. To access: In mobile monitoring: In NRQL and dashboards: Custom data Create and record custom events, interaction traces, and attributes to add details to your existing data and traces. Then, view the custom events that you created in NRQL or dashboards. Network requests Enable the MobileRequest event feature so you can perform a full network analysis. To further investigate network request error rates and response times, query MobileRequest and MobileRequestError events. Crash analysis Review detailed information using groups and filters to analyze trends that lead to crashes. To view more information about crashes, create NRQL queries to review Insights charts related to crash data. Android SDK API Use the Android SDK API for mobile monitoring to instrument parts of your code that are not instrumented by default. Then, view those custom events and attributes in New Relic Insights. Handled exceptions Report exceptions so you can identify factors creating a poor mobile app experience. To further improve performance, review MobileHandledException event records in New Relic Insights. Breadcrumbs Boost the level of detail in crash event trails by adding breadcrumbs. Then, query MobileBreadcrumbs events to see all breadcrumbs or just breadcrumbs related to crashes. See your errors in CodeStream You can also see your Android application's directly in your IDE using CodeStream and errors inbox. To do this, install CodeStream, connect CodeStream and New Relic and create Git tags that match your appVersion.",

To access: In mobile monitoring: In NRQL and dashboards: Custom data Create and record custom events, interaction traces, and attributes to add details to your existing data and traces. Then, view the custom events that you created in NRQL or dashboards. Network requests Enable the MobileRequest event feature so you can perform a full network analysis. To further investigate network request error rates and response times, query MobileRequest and MobileRequestError events. Crash analysis Review detailed information using groups and filters to analyze trends that lead to crashes. To view more information about crashes, create NRQL queries to review Insights charts related to crash data. Android SDK API Use the Android SDK API for mobile monitoring to instrument parts of your code that are not instrumented by default.

      "body": "If you’ve been reading our documentation, chances are you’ve already learned a bit about New Relic and the many tools and capabilities we offer. We’re very proud of the utility and design of our dashboards, alerts, and versatile programmability, but none of it would be possible without the computing power needed to make it all run smoothly. Just like a finely calibrated race car, what you see on the outside may be the most exciting features, and these are the parts you interact with to “drive.” But without an engine designed to win, elegant instrument panels, a responsive clutch, and a great paint job won’t get you anywhere. Under the hood of New Relic lies the engine powering it all: the New Relic Database (NRDB). In this resource, we explain how NRDB helps you succeed in your observability goals. Billions of data points per minute New Relic ingests billions of telemetry data points every minute, serving more than 180,000 accounts simultaneously. To run such a high-volume platform, the underlying database and query capabilities need to be fast, flexible, and scalable. They must also be equally effective for organizations of all sizes, supporting a wide spectrum of telemetry needs and business goals. NRDB provides the power, speed, and scalability you need to monitor your performance across your entire landscape quickly and effectively. Scale, purpose, and equal access to resources To meet the challenging demands for speed, efficiency, scalability, and reliability, we built NRDB with three key objectives. Unlimited scalability: Hosted in the cloud, NRDB's distributed architecture has the capacity for virtually unlimited scale. Monitoring and analysis: With this dual purpose in mind, NRDB handles operational monitoring and data analytics equally well. This means that NRDB can ingest massive amounts of data while also giving you real-time alerting, lightning-fast queries, and charting — all without sacrificing speed. Resources when you need them: As a multi-tenant system supporting tens of thousands of customers, NRDB gives you the resources you need when you need them (which single-tenant systems cannot match). The lifecycle of a query NRDB returns results for queries of all sizes astonishingly fast. To do this, we use parallel processing at massive scale. This architectural approach is equally effective for accelerating a single large query and for allowing numerous users to run small queries simultaneously without impacting speed. It works like this: A user enters a query using one of our tools, such as the query builder, or a dashboard or other type of instrumentation sends an automated query. NRDB starts by sending the query to a router, which in turn sends the query components to hundreds or even thousands of query workers. The query workers find the data, and the process is repeated in reverse, with data returning to populate dashboards, create alerts, or answer discrete queries, among other things. This process yields complete query results in a fraction of the time that other methods would require. To further improve efficiency, NRDB also caches recent queries, allowing it to send those results back to users nearly instantaneously. The result: flexibility, speed, accuracy, and efficiency How big is the difference? Because of NDRB's raw power and purposeful design, New Relic's telemetry products are able to analyze tens of billions of events per second while maintaining a median query response time of 45 milliseconds. We would say, “Your query results are just a heartbeat away,” but mathematically that’s more like a tenth of a heartbeat (unless you’re a mouse). What do these statistics mean for our customers? At the end of the day, NRDB's speed and unique capabilities enable you to identify, analyze, and fix performance problems much faster, reducing downtime so you can get back to business. What’s next? Now it's time to get data into New Relic! New Relic-built agents and integrations There are many ways to get data into your New Relic account. Any New Relic user can use any of our data ingest methods to report data to our platform.When you enable New Relic solutions like APM, browser monitoring, mobile monitoring, infrastructure monitoring, or any of our wide array of quickstarts, by default you'll receive data from your monitored applications, hosts, services, or other entities. Some options for getting started: Log into one.newrelic.com and click Add more data to get some guidance on setting up New Relic solutions. (Need to create a New Relic account first? Sign up for free!) To browse our solutions, see New Relic Instant Observability. Report custom data If you need to report data that our agents and integrations don't provide, we have tools that will allow you to bring in any type of data you need.

      "body": "New Relic's mobile monitoring capabilities help you gain deeper visibility into how to analyze your Android and iOS application performance and troubleshoot crashes. You can also examine HTTP and other network performance for unexpected lag, which will in turn help you collaborate more efficiently with your backend teams. You'll be able to configure mobile monitoring to suit your environnment after you create a New Relic account (it's free, forever!) and install mobile monitoring for your Android, iOS, or Cordova environment. How we use mobile monitoring At New Relic, we have our own mobile developers who create iOS and Android apps so our customers can use New Relic from their mobile devices. During a feature deploy, we encountered a small bug that caused an edge case crash with our Android app. This happened after we had created, tested, and deployed the new feature. Because we work at New Relic, we also use New Relic One to analyze and troubleshoot our mobile apps. To give you an idea of how to explore the power of mobile monitoring, here's an example of how our own mobile engineers used it to track this small bug. A workflow to identify and resolve mobile app crashes using New Relic. 1. Alert notification shows new version crashes The night after a new release, our on-call developer received an alert notification on his mobile phone. The Alerts page indicated that some customers were seeing crashes on the new version of our Android app. Moving to his desktop browser, he checked the Summary page. The overview showed an increase in crashes for the newest version. By filtering for the latest version and setting the time picker to the past 24 hours, he could proceed with crash analysis. An example of using the mobile Summary page to filter to an Android version with crashes. 2. Crash analysis pinpoints exception, location, and more By clicking the Crashes chart title on the mobile Summary page, the Crash analysis page opened with the same 24-hour time frame and filter to this Android version. Here our developer could see a significant number of crashes for the selected version. This reinforced his suspicion there was bad code somewhere in the recent deployment. The developer clicked the link for the crash type to examine the exception, location, and error message. He also examined the stack trace, interaction trail, and event trail to quickly understand where users were impacted. An example of using the Crash analysis page to track down the cause for crashes for a new release by examining the exception, location, and error message. From here the developer saw the error. The new feature had a specific line of bad code that was crashing the app for customers who only used New Relic to monitor one app rather than multiple apps. The team released a hot fix in less than an hour, and the crash rate quickly de-escalated to 0.2%. 3. Problem solved, focus on improving app performance The problem was solved, but the team continues to use New Relic to make sure the most important workflows are running correctly and quickly. We also share HTTP and other network performance trends with our backend API developer teams. Improve frontend and backend performance More than a tool for crash analysis, our mobile monitoring capabilities can help you identify opportunities to speed app performance. For example, you can: Create dashboards to query, visualize, and share performance data. Identify handled exceptions to streamline workflows. See trends with sessions, devices, geographical locations, operating systems, carriers, requests and responses, etc. with crash profiles and HTTP profiles. Set up alert notifications for execution time, errors, etc. Define custom attributes and events to obtain additional, specific details about the mobile data that matters the most to your organization. And more! In addition to crash analysis, do more to fine-tune mobile app performance. Great mobile apps increasingly rely on backend systems to power their functionality, such as requesting product information, authenticating users, or streaming media content. But some backend issues can lead to upstream mobile app crashes, freezes, and broken functionality that impacts end users, including: Changed or non-versioned API endpoints Bad payloads API timeouts Slow or deprecated API endpoints You can use the network pages in our mobile monitoring UI to identify problems that surface through HTTP requests, errors, and other network issues. You can also query your data. Then create dashboards and share this information with backend API developer teams and others in your organization to help improve the overall end user experience with your mobile app. You can also improve your customers' overall digital experience: Get rapid visibility into how your end users experience your mobile apps and web browsers. Analyze actual or simulated end-user behavior to hone in on metrics like load time, availability, and errors, while staying grounded in the backend services that enable these digital experiences. Get started with mobile monitoring Before you install and configure New Relic's functionality for your mobile applications, follow these guidelines for compatibility and other requirements: Android compatibility and requirements iOS compatibility and requirements Then continue with the installation and configuration procedures for your Android, iOS, tvOS, or Cordova application.",

      "body": "Your app's dSYM files are stored in Xcode's dSYM archive path folder. This is the folder where the iOS agent gets the dSYM files that are used to symbolicate your crash reports. New Relic provides a post-build script as part of the iOS agent's install process and the tvOS agent's install process. This script automatically uploads your app's dSYM files. Automatic script The script automatically uploads dSYM files only for release builds. Non-release builds must upload their files either manually or through the mobile monitoring UI. Bitcode-enabled apps have their dSYM files generated by Apple. You must download the dSYM files for Bitcode-enabled apps from Apple and upload them to New Relic. If you see unreadable machine code in the Crashes page, your dSYM files may not be uploaded correctly. In some cases, you may need to manually upload dSYM files. The automatic script uses Python 2. As of October 2019 with macOS 10.15 (Catalina), Python won't be installed by default. If you're using the automatic script (recommended), you may need to manually install Python 2. If you're using Homebrew, see Python on Homebrew. Identify missing dSYMs When a Bitcode-enabled app is uploaded to Apple for App Store review or ad-hoc distribution, dSYMs need to be manually downloaded from Apple and uploaded to New Relic to allow the mobile crash reports to be properly symbolicated. These dSYMs can be downloaded through the archives organizer in Xcode within several minutes of uploading the app. In this situation follow the procedures to find the archive and download dSYMs. If an app is missing a dSYM file, you'll see three indicators in the mobile monitoring UI: Banner notification: A banner warning appears on the Crash report page. The warning reads: We were unable to locate your dsym. Copy Upload prompt: From the Crash type summary page you will be automatically prompted to upload a dSYM file if it is missing. Machine code: The crash stack trace on the Crash report page displays machine code and not a human-readable error message. Upload dSYM files through the mobile monitoring UI You can easily upload your dSYM files directly from the New Relic One UI. The maximum file size is 600 MB. To upload your dSYM files: Go to one.newrelic.com and click Mobile. Then select your app from the list. View Crash analysis. Select a specific crash from the Crash types list. Click Upload dSYM. You can either drag and drop your dSYMs directly, or select the file form your computer. Manually upload dSYM files In some circumstances, New Relic's automatic upload of dSYM files may fail. If a dSYM upload is attempted and fails, it creates a build error with a detailed message. For example, if there's a network failure and the dSYM upload isn't completed, Xcode will report an error. For additional information about how New Relic handles dSYM uploads, see New Relic's Online Technical Community. If the automatic upload fails, you can manually upload your dSYM file. If you have multiple dSYM files, they can be within a single zip with a maximum file size of 600 MB. The YOUR_NEW_RELIC_APPLICATION_TOKEN value in the commands below is the same key used for +[NewRelic startWithApplicationToken:] (in Objective-C) or NewRelic.start(withApplicationToken:) (in Swift). To manually upload your dSYM files: Via Python script (agent versions 6.0.0 or higher) In iOS agent versions 6.0.0 or higher, the agent includes a Python script that automatically processes and uploads symbols. You can call this script from the command line: NewRelicAgent.framework/Resources/generateMap.py \"DSYM_ARCHIVE_PATH\" \"YOUR_NEW_RELIC_APPLICATION_TOKEN\" Copy Via command line To manually upload individual dSYM files from the command line: Zip up your dSYM file or files using the following command. Replace ~ /ZIPPED_DSYM_PATH with your new dSYM archive path and file name (for example, Users/my-name/desktop). Also replace ~ /dSYM_PATH with your existing dSYM file path. /usr/bin/zip --recurse-paths --quiet \"~/ZIPPED_DSYM_PATH\" \"~/dSYM_PATH\" Copy Upload the dSYM zip file using the following command: For US accounts: curl -F dsym=@\"~/DSYM_ZIP_PATH\" -H \"X-APP-LICENSE-KEY: YOUR_NEW_RELIC_APPLICATION_TOKEN\" https://mobile-symbol-upload.newrelic.com/symbol Copy For EU accounts: curl -F dsym=@\"~/DSYM_ZIP_PATH\" -H \"X-APP-LICENSE-KEY: YOUR_NEW_RELIC_APPLICATION_TOKEN\" https://mobile-symbol-upload.eu01.nr-data.net/symbol Copy Troubleshooting Auto-upload failure If a dSYM auto-upload failed, the Report Navigator may have a fully formed cURL command. You can use this cURL command to reattempt an upload. Depending on the error, you may also need to follow some of the dSYM manual upload steps. Here is an example of a successful dSYM upload in the Report Navigator: Example: A successful dSYM upload in the Report Navigator. Missing dSYMs If dSYM files are missing, you may need to check Xcode build settings to ensure the file is being generated. Frameworks which are built locally have separate build settings and may need to be updated as well.

Bitcode-enabled apps have their dSYM files generated by Apple. You must download the dSYM files for Bitcode-enabled apps from Apple and upload them to New Relic. If you see unreadable machine code in the Crashes page, your dSYM files may not be uploaded correctly. In some cases, you may need to manually upload dSYM files. The automatic script uses Python 2. As of October 2019 with macOS 10.15 (Catalina), Python won't be installed by default. If you're using the automatic script (recommended), you may need to manually install Python 2. If you're using Homebrew, see Python on Homebrew. Identify missing dSYMs When a Bitcode-enabled app is uploaded to Apple for App Store review or ad-hoc distribution, dSYMs need to be manually downloaded from Apple and uploaded to New Relic to allow the mobile crash reports to be properly symbolicated. These dSYMs can be downloaded through the archives organizer in Xcode within several minutes of uploading the app. In this situation follow the procedures to find the archive and download dSYMs. If an app is missing a dSYM file, you'll see three indicators in the mobile monitoring UI: Banner notification: A banner warning appears on the Crash report page. The warning reads: We were unable to locate your dsym. Copy Upload prompt: From the Crash type summary page you will be automatically prompted to upload a dSYM file if it is missing. Machine code: The crash stack trace on the Crash report page displays machine code and not a human-readable error message. Upload dSYM files through the mobile monitoring UI You can easily upload your dSYM files directly from the New Relic One UI. The maximum file size is 600 MB. To upload your dSYM files: Go to one.newrelic.com and click Mobile. Then select your app from the list. View Crash analysis. Select a specific crash from the Crash types list. Click Upload dSYM. You can either drag and drop your dSYMs directly, or select the file form your computer. Manually upload dSYM files In some circumstances, New Relic's automatic upload of dSYM files may fail. If a dSYM upload is attempted and fails, it creates a build error with a detailed message. For example, if there's a network failure and the dSYM upload isn't completed, Xcode will report an error. For additional information about how New Relic handles dSYM uploads, see New Relic's Online Technical Community. If the automatic upload fails, you can manually upload your dSYM file. If you have multiple dSYM files, they can be within a single zip with a maximum file size of 600 MB. The YOUR_NEW_RELIC_APPLICATION_TOKEN value in the commands below is the same key used for +[NewRelic startWithApplicationToken:] (in Objective-C) or NewRelic.start(withApplicationToken:) (in Swift). To manually upload your dSYM files: Via Python script (agent versions 6.0.0 or higher) In iOS agent versions 6.0.0 or higher, the agent includes a Python script that automatically processes and uploads symbols. You can call this script from the command line: NewRelicAgent.framework/Resources/generateMap.py \"DSYM_ARCHIVE_PATH\" \"YOUR_NEW_RELIC_APPLICATION_TOKEN\" Copy Via command line To manually upload individual dSYM files from the command line: Zip up your dSYM file or files using the following command. Replace ~ /ZIPPED_DSYM_PATH with your new dSYM archive path and file name (for example, Users/my-name/desktop). Also replace ~ /dSYM_PATH with your existing dSYM file path. /usr/bin/zip --recurse-paths --quiet \"~/ZIPPED_DSYM_PATH\" \"~/dSYM_PATH\" Copy Upload the dSYM zip file using the following command: For US accounts: curl -F dsym=@\"~/DSYM_ZIP_PATH\" -H \"X-APP-LICENSE-KEY: YOUR_NEW_RELIC_APPLICATION_TOKEN\" https://mobile-symbol-upload.newrelic.com/symbol Copy For EU accounts: curl -F dsym=@\"~/DSYM_ZIP_PATH\" -H \"X-APP-LICENSE-KEY: YOUR_NEW_RELIC_APPLICATION_TOKEN\" https://mobile-symbol-upload.eu01.nr-data.net/symbol Copy Troubleshooting Auto-upload failure If a dSYM auto-upload failed, the Report Navigator may have a fully formed cURL command. You can use this cURL command to reattempt an upload. Depending on the error, you may also need to follow some of the dSYM manual upload steps. Here is an example of a successful dSYM upload in the Report Navigator: Example: A successful dSYM upload in the Report Navigator. Missing dSYMs If dSYM files are missing, you may need to check Xcode build settings to ensure the file is being generated. Frameworks which are built locally have separate build settings and may need to be updated as well.

DistributedTraceSummary MobileRequest MobileRequestError Span Transaction TransactionError InfrastructureEvent Data sources : InfrastructureCloudTrail InfrastructureEvent describes changes (deltas) that occur in a system's live state. When an inventory or system state is added, removed, or changed, Infrastructure will produce an InfrastructureEvent that logs that activity. Attribute name Definition Data types category A New Relic category used to organize events in the UI. For example: automation, notification, and service. InfrastructureEvent changeType A simple classification of the type of change made to the entity: added, modified, or removed. InfrastructureEvent changedPath The fully specified name of the item that changed. This is constructed by taking the source and adding one or more additional path elements that uniquely identify the item that changed. InfrastructureEvent deltaId Delta refers to a recorded change in the system. The deltaId is a number used by New Relic to organize incoming inventory change data. InfrastructureEvent eventId The unique ID of the event, generated by New Relic. InfrastructureEvent format The type of infrastructure event. Each format type includes attributes that may be used to render the event in the UI. InfrastructureEvent newStatus The new agent status: disconnected or connected. InfrastructureEvent newValue If a change is made to the entity, this attribute contains the new value of the inventory that was changed. This will have no value if no change has been made. The value will display approximately 4K bytes of data. InfrastructureEvent oldValue If a change is made to the entity, this attribute contains the old value of the inventory that was changed. This will be blank if no change has been made. InfrastructureEvent provider For integrations that use generic event types (like the DatastoreSample event), the provider value specifies the source of the data (the service, or a sub-category of data from that service). Some Insights events are generic and are used by several integrations. For example, the DatastoreSample event is used by several integrations, including the AWS DynamoDB integration and the AWS RDS integration. In these cases, the provider attribute value represents the source of that attribute. This will usually be the service that data comes from or, for integrations that use several provider values, a certain sub-category of data from that service. When a provider value is present for a generic event, that event will have additional integration-specific attributes attached to it. Here’s an example of an Insights NRQL query that returns the attributes present for a DatastoreSample event reported by the AWS RDS integration: SELECT * from DatastoreSample where provider = 'RdsDbCluster' InfrastructureEvent source The fully specified origin of this inventory item. This is typically in the form category/plugin, where plugin is the generic word used for the tool that gathered this data. InfrastructureEvent summary A summary of the change that happened.

Includes real-time and historical data. Select the icon to see transaction details. Select Overview Charts to view summary charts of your top five transactions. Browser monitoring (iPhone and iPad). Provide overview dashboard, including average page load time, browser Apdex, average throughput, and more. Infrastructure monitoring (iPhone only). Alerts (iPhone and iPad). Get alert and deployment notifications. Synthetic monitoring (iPhone only). Mobile monitoring (iPhone and iPad). Includes crash reports, network errors, API calls, and active user count. New Relic's iOS app does not have all the features of the New Relic web application. For more detailed analysis, sign in to your New Relic account with a web browser. Time range When viewing an application or host, you can change the visible time frame by using the clock icon in the top right of the page. This feature is similar to the standard New Relic time picker. Features include: Scrub the New Relic charts to move back and forth across the timeline. Select the time picker to choose a time range that ends now (from 30 minutes to 90 days ago). For iPads: to specify an end time other than now, slide the toggle from Ending Now to Custom Date. Synthetic monitoring You can use the iOS app to view your synthetic monitoring data, including charts of your monitor's availability, load times, and load sizes. Select the caret icon to view more detailed charts. You can mute or disable your monitor, and view details of any recent errors. For scripted monitors, you can view and search the script log. Alerts When you connect the iOS app to your New Relic account, your device is automatically associated with your user channel. Then, you can add your user channel to your target policy to receive alerts. For iOS alerts, notifications appear on your lock screen and can be viewed by swiping the alert. You can select any alert to view error details or acknowledge the alert. New Relic also sends a push notification when a colleague acknowledges an open event. Then, New Relic sends a final, closing notification when all Critical events end. Mobile monitoring If you have a mobile application and have installed mobile monitoring, you can monitor its performance directly from your iPhone or iPad. Mobile monitoring includes network errors, API calls, and number of active users. You can also view detailed individual crash reports for a deeper understanding of a particular crash incident. Data privacy New Relic's mobile apps only record information needed to help authenticate and troubleshoot: User's email address associated with your New Relic account, including first and last name (for authentication purposes only) IP address Device ID For more information, see our Mobile data privacy and security documentation.",

      "body": "Your app's dSYM files are stored in Xcode's dSYM archive path folder. This is the folder where the iOS agent gets the dSYM files that are used to symbolicate your crash reports. New Relic provides a post-build script as part of the iOS agent's install process and the tvOS agent's install process. This script automatically uploads your app's dSYM files. Automatic script The script automatically uploads dSYM files only for release builds. Non-release builds must upload their files either manually or through the mobile monitoring UI. Bitcode-enabled apps have their dSYM files generated by Apple. You must download the dSYM files for Bitcode-enabled apps from Apple and upload them to New Relic. If you see unreadable machine code in the Crashes page, your dSYM files may not be uploaded correctly. In some cases, you may need to manually upload dSYM files. The automatic script uses Python 2. As of October 2019 with macOS 10.15 (Catalina), Python won't be installed by default. If you're using the automatic script (recommended), you may need to manually install Python 2. If you're using Homebrew, see Python on Homebrew. Identify missing dSYMs When a Bitcode-enabled app is uploaded to Apple for App Store review or ad-hoc distribution, dSYMs need to be manually downloaded from Apple and uploaded to New Relic to allow the mobile crash reports to be properly symbolicated. These dSYMs can be downloaded through the archives organizer in Xcode within several minutes of uploading the app. In this situation follow the procedures to find the archive and download dSYMs. If an app is missing a dSYM file, you'll see three indicators in the mobile monitoring UI: Banner notification: A banner warning appears on the Crash report page. The warning reads: We were unable to locate your dsym. Copy Upload prompt: From the Crash type summary page you will be automatically prompted to upload a dSYM file if it is missing. Machine code: The crash stack trace on the Crash report page displays machine code and not a human-readable error message. Upload dSYM files through the mobile monitoring UI You can easily upload your dSYM files directly from the New Relic One UI. The maximum file size is 600 MB. To upload your dSYM files: Go to one.newrelic.com and click Mobile. Then select your app from the list. View Crash analysis. Select a specific crash from the Crash types list. Click Upload dSYM. You can either drag and drop your dSYMs directly, or select the file form your computer. Manually upload dSYM files In some circumstances, New Relic's automatic upload of dSYM files may fail. If a dSYM upload is attempted and fails, it creates a build error with a detailed message. For example, if there's a network failure and the dSYM upload isn't completed, Xcode will report an error. For additional information about how New Relic handles dSYM uploads, see New Relic's Online Technical Community. If the automatic upload fails, you can manually upload your dSYM file. If you have multiple dSYM files, they can be within a single zip with a maximum file size of 600 MB. The YOUR_NEW_RELIC_APPLICATION_TOKEN value in the commands below is the same key used for +[NewRelic startWithApplicationToken:] (in Objective-C) or NewRelic.start(withApplicationToken:) (in Swift). To manually upload your dSYM files: Via Python script (agent versions 6.0.0 or higher) In iOS agent versions 6.0.0 or higher, the agent includes a Python script that automatically processes and uploads symbols. You can call this script from the command line: NewRelicAgent.framework/Resources/generateMap.py \"DSYM_ARCHIVE_PATH\" \"YOUR_NEW_RELIC_APPLICATION_TOKEN\" Copy Via command line To manually upload individual dSYM files from the command line: Zip up your dSYM file or files using the following command. Replace ~ /ZIPPED_DSYM_PATH with your new dSYM archive path and file name (for example, Users/my-name/desktop). Also replace ~ /dSYM_PATH with your existing dSYM file path. /usr/bin/zip --recurse-paths --quiet \"~/ZIPPED_DSYM_PATH\" \"~/dSYM_PATH\" Copy Upload the dSYM zip file using the following command: For US accounts: curl -F dsym=@\"~/DSYM_ZIP_PATH\" -H \"X-APP-LICENSE-KEY: YOUR_NEW_RELIC_APPLICATION_TOKEN\" https://mobile-symbol-upload.newrelic.com/symbol Copy For EU accounts: curl -F dsym=@\"~/DSYM_ZIP_PATH\" -H \"X-APP-LICENSE-KEY: YOUR_NEW_RELIC_APPLICATION_TOKEN\" https://mobile-symbol-upload.eu01.nr-data.net/symbol Copy Troubleshooting Auto-upload failure If a dSYM auto-upload failed, the Report Navigator may have a fully formed cURL command. You can use this cURL command to reattempt an upload. Depending on the error, you may also need to follow some of the dSYM manual upload steps. Here is an example of a successful dSYM upload in the Report Navigator: Example: A successful dSYM upload in the Report Navigator. Missing dSYMs If dSYM files are missing, you may need to check Xcode build settings to ensure the file is being generated. Frameworks which are built locally have separate build settings and may need to be updated as well.

      "body": "Your app's dSYM files are stored in Xcode's dSYM archive path folder. This is the folder where the iOS agent gets the dSYM files that are used to symbolicate your crash reports. New Relic provides a post-build script as part of the iOS agent's install process and the tvOS agent's install process. This script automatically uploads your app's dSYM files. Automatic script The script automatically uploads dSYM files only for release builds. Non-release builds must upload their files either manually or through the mobile monitoring UI. Bitcode-enabled apps have their dSYM files generated by Apple. You must download the dSYM files for Bitcode-enabled apps from Apple and upload them to New Relic. If you see unreadable machine code in the Crashes page, your dSYM files may not be uploaded correctly. In some cases, you may need to manually upload dSYM files. The automatic script uses Python 2. As of October 2019 with macOS 10.15 (Catalina), Python won't be installed by default. If you're using the automatic script (recommended), you may need to manually install Python 2. If you're using Homebrew, see Python on Homebrew. Identify missing dSYMs When a Bitcode-enabled app is uploaded to Apple for App Store review or ad-hoc distribution, dSYMs need to be manually downloaded from Apple and uploaded to New Relic to allow the mobile crash reports to be properly symbolicated. These dSYMs can be downloaded through the archives organizer in Xcode within several minutes of uploading the app. In this situation follow the procedures to find the archive and download dSYMs. If an app is missing a dSYM file, you'll see three indicators in the mobile monitoring UI: Banner notification: A banner warning appears on the Crash report page. The warning reads: We were unable to locate your dsym. Copy Upload prompt: From the Crash type summary page you will be automatically prompted to upload a dSYM file if it is missing. Machine code: The crash stack trace on the Crash report page displays machine code and not a human-readable error message. Upload dSYM files through the mobile monitoring UI You can easily upload your dSYM files directly from the New Relic One UI. The maximum file size is 600 MB. To upload your dSYM files: Go to one.newrelic.com and click Mobile. Then select your app from the list. View Crash analysis. Select a specific crash from the Crash types list. Click Upload dSYM. You can either drag and drop your dSYMs directly, or select the file form your computer. Manually upload dSYM files In some circumstances, New Relic's automatic upload of dSYM files may fail. If a dSYM upload is attempted and fails, it creates a build error with a detailed message. For example, if there's a network failure and the dSYM upload isn't completed, Xcode will report an error. For additional information about how New Relic handles dSYM uploads, see New Relic's Online Technical Community. If the automatic upload fails, you can manually upload your dSYM file. If you have multiple dSYM files, they can be within a single zip with a maximum file size of 600 MB. The YOUR_NEW_RELIC_APPLICATION_TOKEN value in the commands below is the same key used for +[NewRelic startWithApplicationToken:] (in Objective-C) or NewRelic.start(withApplicationToken:) (in Swift). To manually upload your dSYM files: Via Python script (agent versions 6.0.0 or higher) In iOS agent versions 6.0.0 or higher, the agent includes a Python script that automatically processes and uploads symbols. You can call this script from the command line: NewRelicAgent.framework/Resources/generateMap.py \"DSYM_ARCHIVE_PATH\" \"YOUR_NEW_RELIC_APPLICATION_TOKEN\" Copy Via command line To manually upload individual dSYM files from the command line: Zip up your dSYM file or files using the following command. Replace ~ /ZIPPED_DSYM_PATH with your new dSYM archive path and file name (for example, Users/my-name/desktop). Also replace ~ /dSYM_PATH with your existing dSYM file path. /usr/bin/zip --recurse-paths --quiet \"~/ZIPPED_DSYM_PATH\" \"~/dSYM_PATH\" Copy Upload the dSYM zip file using the following command: For US accounts: curl -F dsym=@\"~/DSYM_ZIP_PATH\" -H \"X-APP-LICENSE-KEY: YOUR_NEW_RELIC_APPLICATION_TOKEN\" https://mobile-symbol-upload.newrelic.com/symbol Copy For EU accounts: curl -F dsym=@\"~/DSYM_ZIP_PATH\" -H \"X-APP-LICENSE-KEY: YOUR_NEW_RELIC_APPLICATION_TOKEN\" https://mobile-symbol-upload.eu01.nr-data.net/symbol Copy Troubleshooting Auto-upload failure If a dSYM auto-upload failed, the Report Navigator may have a fully formed cURL command. You can use this cURL command to reattempt an upload. Depending on the error, you may also need to follow some of the dSYM manual upload steps. Here is an example of a successful dSYM upload in the Report Navigator: Example: A successful dSYM upload in the Report Navigator. Missing dSYMs If dSYM files are missing, you may need to check Xcode build settings to ensure the file is being generated. Frameworks which are built locally have separate build settings and may need to be updated as well.

When an iOS or tvOS application crashes, the operating system creates a crash report and stores it on the device. New Relic uploads this report the next time the app launches. Using this report and any relevant dSYM files, the crash report includes the complete stack trace with human-readable information. You can then log into New Relic and see each crash, including the method and line where it crashed, plus device and environment details. dSYM files When you create a release build of an iOS or tvOS application, the names of methods and classes are stripped, leaving only machine-readable memory addresses. When the application crashes, the stack trace consists of this machine-readable code. A dSYM file is an Xcode project file for debug symbols. It contains the debugging symbols that allow for translation of the initial crash report to human-readable information. This process is known as symbolication. New Relic has dynamic framework support for dSYM uploading. If your app uses a dynamic framework with multiple dSYM files, New Relic automatically uploads and uses those files. For more information, see Retrieve and download dSYMs or Upload dSYM files. Debug the crash reporter Crash reporting is enabled by default, but there are some circumstances where it will be disabled: If the debugger is enabled: There can only be one uncaught exception handler registered at a time per application. If running with the debugger attached, New Relic will not capture and report crashes. If another crash reporter is enabled: If another uncaught exception handler is registered after New Relic starts, this error message is logged: The New Relic exception handler has been replaced.

Machine code: The crash stack trace on the Crash report page displays machine code and not a human-readable error message. Download dSYM files using iTunes Connect To download the dSYM files you need for your app: Log in to Apple iTunes Connect. Select My Apps > (selected app) > Activity. From the list of builds for your application, select the build number you need for the dSYM. Select Download dSYM. Then, to upload the resulting zip file directly to New Relic: Follow the instructions to manually upload dSYM, and skip step 1. Unpack one dSYM contained in this zip file to retrieve a build UUID that you can upload. (Follow the last step in the manual upload instructions.) Once New Relic receives the zip file, the build UUIDs for all other dSYMs contained in that zip file will be identified. Download dSYM files using Xcode's app archive Use the app version and build number to identify the applicable app archive in the Xcode Organizer and download the dSYMs. Using Xcode to download dSYMs: From the Archives tab, select the app and version/build, then select Download dSYMs. Open the Xcode Organizer: From the Xcode menu, select Window > Organizer > Archives > (select a mobile app). From Version, select the archive that matches the app version (listed first) and build number (following the app version in parentheses). Select Download dSYMs. The dSYMs will be downloaded from Apple if available and if the file names contain a series of letters and numbers. If the dSYM files are named after the the dependencies in your project, the download will not be successful. Upload dSYMs Once you have located the dSYMs, follow the instructions to upload a dSYM for each zipped dSYM.",

When an iOS or tvOS application crashes, the operating system creates a crash report and stores it on the device. New Relic uploads this report the next time the app launches. Using this report and any relevant dSYM files, the crash report includes the complete stack trace with human-readable information. You can then log into New Relic and see each crash, including the method and line where it crashed, plus device and environment details. dSYM files When you create a release build of an iOS or tvOS application, the names of methods and classes are stripped, leaving only machine-readable memory addresses. When the application crashes, the stack trace consists of this machine-readable code. A dSYM file is an Xcode project file for debug symbols. It contains the debugging symbols that allow for translation of the initial crash report to human-readable information. This process is known as symbolication. New Relic has dynamic framework support for dSYM uploading. If your app uses a dynamic framework with multiple dSYM files, New Relic automatically uploads and uses those files. For more information, see Retrieve and download dSYMs or Upload dSYM files. Debug the crash reporter Crash reporting is enabled by default, but there are some circumstances where it will be disabled: If the debugger is enabled: There can only be one uncaught exception handler registered at a time per application. If running with the debugger attached, New Relic will not capture and report crashes. If another crash reporter is enabled: If another uncaught exception handler is registered after New Relic starts, this error message is logged: The New Relic exception handler has been replaced. This may result in crashes no longer reporting to New Relic.

For a general overview of mobile monitoring functionality, see Introduction to mobile monitoring. Compatibility and requirements Before you install the iOS agent, review the compatibility and requirements. Install the agent As part of the installation process, New Relic automatically generates an application token. This is a 40-character hexadecimal string for authenticating each mobile app that you monitor. There are two ways you can install the iOS agent: We recommend you install and configure the iOS agent using the CocoaPods installation method. You can also manually install and configure the iOS agent by adding the New Relic framework to your app. Extend your instrumentation After you install the agent, you can extend the agent's default instrumentation with various types of custom data: To access: In the mobile UI: In New Relic One dashboards: Custom data Create and record custom events, interaction traces, and attributes to add details to your existing data and traces. You can also query the custom events that you created in New Relic One dashboards and NRQL. Network requests Enable the MobileRequest event feature so you can perform a full network analysis. To further investigate network request error rates and response times, query MobileRequest and MobileRequestError events. Crash analysis Review detailed information using groups and filters to analyze trends that lead to crashes. To view more information about crashes, create NRQL queries to review Insights charts related to crash data. iOS SDK API Use the iOS SDK API to instrument parts of your code that are not instrumented by default. Then, view those custom events and attributes in New Relic Insights. Handled exceptions Report exceptions so you can identify factors creating a poor mobile app experience. To further improve performance, review MobileHandledException event records in New Relic Insights. Breadcrumbs Boost the level of detail in crash event trails by adding breadcrumbs. Then, query MobileBreadcrumbs events to see all breadcrumbs or just breadcrumbs related to crashes. Troubleshoot your installation If the agent isn't reporting data, try these troubleshooting suggestions.",

Install your iOS application As part of the installation process, New Relic automatically generates an application token. This is a 40-character hexadecimal string for authenticating each mobile app you monitor in New Relic. To install and configure your iOS application: Go to one.newrelic.com. If applicable: From the Mobile Apps index, select Add a new app. From the Get started page, select XCFramework as the platform for mobile monitoring. Type a name for your mobile app, and select Continue. Continue with the steps to configure New Relic. Add the New Relic framework to your app Download and unzip the iOS SDK for New Relic. To add the New Relic framework to your Xcode project: Use Finder to drag the NewRelicAgent.framework folder into your Xcode project, and drop it onto your project in the Project navigator window, under Frameworks, Libraries, and Embedded Content. Make sure Embed & Sign is selected under the Embed dropdown menu. Implement the agent using the appropriate method: Important To ensure proper instrumentation, you must call the agent on the first line of didFinishLaunchingWithOptions(), and run the agent on the main thread. Starting the call later, on a background thread, or asynchronously can cause unexpected or unstable behavior. Language Procedure Objective-C To start the agent: Import the New Relic header at the top of your prefix.pch. Add +[NewRelic startWithApplicationToken:@\"<appToken>\"] to the top of -application:didFinishLaunchingWithOptions: in your AppDelegate.m, using the unique application token that is automatically generated. Swift Create a bridging header file: Select File > New > File > Objective-C File. Name the file Placeholder.m, then select Next. Select Create, and confirm Xcode's prompt to generate the bridging header. Delete Placeholder.m. Import the New Relic agent by adding #import \"NewRelic/NewRelic.h\" to the top of MyApp-Bridging-Header.h. Add NewRelic.start(withApplicationToken: \">appToken>\") to the top of application(_:didFinishLaunchingWithOptions:) in your AppDelegate.swift using the unique application token that is automatically generated.

      "body": "Our Python agent monitors your Python application to help you identify and solve performance issues. You can also extend your performance monitoring to collect and analyze business data to help you improve the customer experience and make data-driven business decisions. With flexible options for custom instrumentation and APIs, The Python agent offers multiple building blocks to customize the data you need from your app. Our Python works with a wide variety of web frameworks and hosting mechanisms, including Django, Gunicorn, WSGI, CherryPy, uWSGI, and more. You can also install the Python agent in a Google App Engine flexible environment. Monitor app performance After you install the Python agent, it begins to collect data about your app. You can view the data as charts and tables in New Relic One. View the big picture of your app. Monitor your app's Apdex (user satisfaction). Get a high-level summary of your app with Summary page. Enable distributed tracing to see activity across an architecture having many services. Install Infrastructure monitoring and view detailed server/host data for your app. Find errors and problems quickly. Track key transactions specific to your business. Create custom dashboards for important metrics. Alert your team when an error or problem occurs before it affects your users. View performance after a deployment. Drill down into performance details. Examine code-level transaction traces. Examine database query traces. Examine error traces. Use thread profiler sessions to see detailed stack traces of sampled threads View logs for your APM and infrastructure data Bring your logs and application's data together to make troubleshooting easier and faster. No need to switch to another UI page in New Relic One. With logs in context, you can see log messages related to your errors and traces directly in your app's UI. You can also see logs in context of your infrastructure data, such as Kubernetes clusters. Extend agent instrumentation Other helpful tools include: Tools Description Browser monitoring Integrate the Python agent with browser monitoring to gain visibility into end-user browser activity. Simple scripts and background tasks Monitor job-based or task queuing systems, like Celery, or other standalone non-web functions. Business data analysis with data exploration. Use the Python agent with our data explorer to organize, query, and visualize your data to answer key questions about application performance and customer experience. Use default transaction attributes, or add your own. Query your data using the New Relic Query Language (NRQL). Send your own event data. Create and share customizable, interactive dashboards. Install the Python agent Before you install the Python agent, make sure your system meets the system requirements. You must also create a New Relic account. We support a number of web frameworks and libraries right out of the box, including Django, WSGI, and Gunicorn. If you use one of the supported web frameworks, installation is easy. If you use an unsupported framework, the process will involve some additions to your app code and/or web server files. For a quick and simple install process that will work for the majority of setups, follow these simple steps: Download and install the Python package. Create config file. Integrate the Python agent with your application. Read the Quick Start guide Add Python data Monitor non-web scripts, background tasks, and functions The Python agent also lets you monitor non-web scripts, worker processes, tasks, and functions. The installation process for these non-web transactions is similar to the one used for a web app, with one major difference: instead of going through the standard integration process described in the install instructions, you would manually \"wrap\" any function you want to monitor. For more information, see Non-web tasks and processes. For instructions on monitoring Celery tasks, see Celery background tasks. What's next after installation? Once you get the agent up and running, some suggested next steps are: Explore your data in and get comfortable with the user interface. Read our docs on our other observability solutions and the APM page. Change your application's name, or other configuration options. Learn about setting up custom instrumentation for application activity not monitored by default. Consider the Python Telemetry SDK. Troubleshooting After you complete the install process, your data should appear in the APM UI within five minutes. If it does not, use these troubleshooting resources: If no data appears, follow these troubleshooting steps. If you experience issues when installing or running the Python agent on a new host, test that the package is installed correctly and that it can contact New Relic's data collector service. For other problems, see the full list of troubleshooting documentation. Check the source code The Python agent is open source software. That means you can browse its source code and send improvements, or create your own fork and build it. For more information, see the README.",

To install the MySQL monitoring integration, you must run through the following steps: Enabling your MySQL Server. Configure the integration. Install and activate the integration. Find and use data. Optionally, see the advanced configuration settings. Compatibility and requirements MySQL versions Our integration is compatible with MySQL version 5.6 or higher. Important For MySQL v8.0 and higher we do not support the following metrics: cluster.slaveRunning, db.qCacheFreeMemoryBytes, db.qCacheHitRatio, and db.qCacheNotCachedPerSecond. System requirements A New Relic account. Don't have one? Sign up for free! No credit card required. If MySQL is not running on Kubernetes or Amazon ECS, you can install the infrastructure agent on a Linux or Windows OS host or on a host capable of remotely accessing where MySQL is installed. Otherwise: If running on Kubernetes, see these requirements. If running on Amazon ECS, see these requirements. Enabling your MySQL Server To capture data from the MySQL integration, you must first create a MySQL user with replication and select permissions to allow the integration to fetch metrics. From the command line, create a user newrelic@localhost with a specific password by running: bash Copy $ sudo mysql -e \"CREATE USER 'newrelic'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY $YOUR_PASSWORD WITH MAX_USER_CONNECTIONS 5;\" Grant replication privileges to newrelic@localhost, with a maximum of 5 connections, by running: bash Copy $ sudo mysql -e \"GRANT REPLICATION CLIENT ON *.* TO 'newrelic'@'localhost' WITH MAX_USER_CONNECTIONS 5;\" Grant privileges to newrelic@localhost, with a maximum of 5 connections, by running: bash Copy $ sudo mysql -e \"GRANT SELECT ON *.* TO 'newrelic'@'localhost' WITH MAX_USER_CONNECTIONS 5;\" Configure the integration There are several ways to configure the integration, depending on how it was installed: If enabled via Kubernetes, see Monitor services running on Kubernetes. If enabled via Amazon ECS, see Monitor services running on ECS. If installed on-host: edit the config in the integration's YAML config file, mysql-config.yml. An integration's YAML-format configuration is where you can place required login credentials and configure how data is collected. Which options you change depend on your setup and preference. The configuration file has common settings applicable to all integrations like interval, timeout, inventory_source. To read all about these common settings refer to our Configuration Format document. Important If you are still using our Legacy configuration and definition files, refer to this document for help. Install and activate the integration To install the MySQL integration, follow the instructions for your environment: Linux installation Follow the instructions for installing an integration, and use nri-mysql as filename. Change the directory to the integrations configuration folder by running: bash Copy $ cd /etc/newrelic-infra/integrations.d Copy the sample configuration file by running: bash Copy $ sudo cp mysql-config.yml.sample mysql-config.yml Edit the mysql-config.yml configuration file with your favorite editor. Check out some great configuration file examples.. Restart the infrastructure agent. See how to restart the infrastructure agent in different Linux environments. Other environments Windows installation Download the .MSI installer image for New Relic's MySQL integration. Install New Relic's MySQL integration by openning command prompt and running: bash Copy $ msiexec.exe /qn /i $PATH_TO\\nri-mysql-amd64.msi In the Integrations directory, C:\\Program Files\\New Relic\\newrelic-infra\\integrations.d\\, create a copy of the sample configuration file by running: bash Copy $ cp mysql-config.yml.sample mysql-config.yml Edit the mysql-config.yml file by using one of the mysql-config.yml sample files. Restart the infrastructure agent. See how to restart the infrastructure agent in different Linux environments. Amazon ECS installation See Monitor service running on ECS. Kubernetes installation See Monitor service running on Kubernetes. Additional notes: Advanced: Integrations are also available in tarball format to allow for install outside of a package manager. On-host integrations do not automatically update. For best results, regularly update the integration package and the infrastructure agent. mysql-config.yml sample files Basic configuration This is the basic configuration used to collect metrics and inventory from your localhost: integrations: - name: nri-mysql env: HOSTNAME: localhost PORT: 3306 USERNAME: mysql_user PASSWORD: mysql_password REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 30s labels: environment: production inventory_source: config/mysql Copy Basic configuration with different metric/inventory intervals This configuration collects metrics every 30 seconds and inventory every 60 seconds: integrations: - name: nri-mysql env: METRICS: true HOSTNAME: localhost PORT: 3306 USERNAME: mysql_user PASSWORD: mysql_password REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 30s labels: environment: production - name: nri-mysql env: INVENTORY: true HOSTNAME: localhost PORT: 3306 USERNAME: mysql_user PASSWORD: mysql_password REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 60s labels: environment: production inventory_source: config/mysql Copy Metrics-only with TLS connection Use to connect to MySQL with TLS.

      "body": "Our PHP agent auto-instruments your code so you can start monitoring applications. You can use our guided installation for an automated install, or follow the instructions in this document to complete a basic PHP agent installation. Either way, you need a New Relic account. (It's free, forever.) Get an account Start guided install EU guided install PHP components Our PHP agent consists of two basic components: A PHP extension, which collects data from your application A local proxy daemon, which transmits the data to New Relic Your system's configuration components, including the web server, operating system, system permissions, PHP installation itself, package manager, etc., are all important factors during installation and configuration, because the agent is a part of that. For more information about supported PHP releases, frameworks, and other system requirements, see PHP compatibility and requirements. Install the agent Follow this general process to install the agent on your system. The agent installation package or tar archive includes the interactive newrelic-install script, which automates some installation tasks. Tip If your application is frequently inactive, we recommend you generate some data by interacting with the application or site. This will help ensure the agent initially connects. If you haven't already, create a New Relic account. It's free, forever. Ensure your system meets the agent's requirements, including appropriate system permissions. From your Account settings, copy your license key information. Install the agent package or tar archive on your system. RedHat or CentOS The most common way to install the agent on RedHat or CentOS is with the installation package (.rpm) and the package manager. You can tell the package manager to get it from the New Relic repository, or you can download the .rpm file directly from the New Relic website. Install the package with your preferred package manager (yum or rpm) and then run the newrelic-install script. Ubuntu or Debian Install the package either with apt-get or with dpkg commands. Typically, running the newrelic-install script is not required. Tar archive The .tar archive method is the most generic method you can use on all supported operating systems. Download the compressed tar archive for your system if any of these situations apply to you: Your operating system is not listed here. You are not using a package manager. Other methods are unsuccessful. Install the tar archive of the agent on any supported platform. Change the default application name to a meaningful name. Optional: Change other agent configuration settings to further customize your installation. Restart your web server (Apache, Nginx, PHP-FPM, etc.). Recommendation: To help ensure the PHP agent is initiated, especially if your application has infrequent activity, generate some data by using the app for a few seconds. Wait a few minutes for your application to send data to New Relic. Then, check your app's performance in the New Relic UI. View logs for your APM and infrastructure data You can also bring your logs and application's data together to make troubleshooting easier and faster. With logs in context, you can see log messages related to your errors and traces directly in your app's UI. You can also see logs in context of your infrastructure data, such as Kubernetes clusters. No need to switch to another UI page in New Relic One. Install PHP with partnership accounts Installation procedures may be different for admins who install the PHP agent through a New Relic partnership. For more information, see: AWS Heroku Magento Shared hosting providers Other partnership installation procedures Not all partners support PHP agents.",

This document contains the iOS SDK instrumentation requirements for: Objective C Swift For details about the available methods for custom attributes and events you can send to to New Relic Insights, see the iOS SDK API reference. You can also configure feature flags for: Objective-C Swift Automatically instrumented classes and methods The following methods (for the listed classes and their sub-classes) are already instrumented by New Relic. You do not need to add custom instrumentation to trace them.

Summary categories include: View loading UI layout Database Images JSON Network Instrument your Objective-C code To have your own Objective-C code appear in interaction code breakdowns and timelines, add a _START call to the beginning of your method and a _STOP call to the end of it. Important Always include a _STOP for each _START, and only include one set of these commands in a given method. The trace system will automatically pick up the class and method name, and report performance metrics for your method to New Relic. - (void)myMethod { NR_TRACE_METHOD_START(0); // … existing code NR_TRACE_METHOD_STOP; } Copy If you are not using ARC, use this version of the _STOP macro to avoid memory leaks: NR_NONARC_TRACE_METHOD_STOP; Copy If you want your method’s performance to be included in the summary data on the APM Overview page, pass one of the NRTraceType enum values into the _START macro; for example: NR_TRACE_METHOD_START(NRTraceTypeDatabase); Copy Create and complete interactions By default, an interaction starts when a view controller is pushed. To manually start an interaction with Objective-C, use these API calls: NSString* uniqueIdentifier = NR_START_NAMED_INTERACTION(@\"name\"); Copy This macro will automatically begin tracking the name interaction trace from the current line. It will also complete any previously running interaction. It returns a unique identifier that can be used to complete that interaction by using this API call: NR_INTERACTION_STOP(uniqueIdentifier); Copy This macro will complete the interaction associated with the uniqueIdentifier if that interaction has not already completed automatically. You do not need to call this method. Rename a default interaction By default, the iOS agent will start an interaction trace when a new view controller is displayed. The interactions are named using the format Display <ViewController>. To change these default names with Objective-C, implement the - (NSString*) customNewRelicInteractionName instance method in your view controller, where the string returned becomes the interaction's name. Set a custom application version The New Relic iOS SDK allows you to set a custom application version string with Objective-C. Instead of using the string defined in CFBundleShortVersionString, call the +[NewRelic setApplicationVersion:] method and pass along the custom application version before calling +[NewRelic startWithApplicationToken:]; [NewRelic setApplicationVersion:(NSString*) appVersion]; Copy Set a custom build identifier As of version 5.1.0 of the New Relic iOS SDK, an API method allows you to set a custom build identifier that is displayed next to the application version in the Crash details page. Instead of using the CFBundleVersion string defined in Xcode with Objective-C, call the +[NewRelic setApplicationBuild:] method, and pass along the custom build identifier. [NewRelic setApplicationBuild:(NSString*) buildNumber]; Copy Create custom metrics Custom metrics can help track high level events specific to your application. With the recordMetric API, you can record arbitrary numerical data and named events with Objective-C and Swift. You can also use several API calls to record custom metrics that provide different levels of detail. Objective-C: Report custom attributes and events Use methods in the NewRelic object to report custom attributes and events. For details about the available methods for custom attributes and events with Objective-C, see the iOS SDK API reference. Methods that return BOOL results return YES if they succeed, or NO if the operation did not complete. These methods are available in versions 5.0.0 or higher of the New Relic iOS SDK. The SDK can store up to 128 user-defined custom attributes at a time. If you attempt to store more than 128 attributes, the SDK returns NO. Custom attributes names should use the simplest format needed, and New Relic recommends single word attributes, containing no spaces. Attribute phrases can be formatted in camel case, so My Custom Attribute is better specified as myCustomAttribute. As with custom metrics: Avoid using the characters / ] [ | * when naming things. Avoid multi-byte characters. Objective-C: Track custom network requests If you can express a transactional network request in terms similar to an HTTP request, you can track it. Use URLs that are well-formed and do not include highly variable paths or hostnames. For requests that complete, use this method: [NewRelic noticeNetworkRequestForURL:(NSURL*)url httpMethod:(NSString*)httpMethod withTimer:(NRTimer *)timer responseHeaders:(NSDictionary *)headers statusCode:(NSInteger)httpStatusCode bytesSent:(NSUInteger)bytesSent bytesReceived:(NSUInteger)bytesReceived responseData:(NSData *)responseData andParams:(NSDictionary *)params]; Copy Parameters include: Parameter Description url The URL of the request httpMethod The method type of the request; for example, POST, GET, etc. timer An NRTimer that timed the network request headers A dictionary containing the HTTP response headers, if available httpStatusCode The response status code If the httpStatusCode is greater than or equal to 400, the agent will record a server error and may capture the responseData body if provided. bytesSent The size of the request body bytesReceived The size of the responseBody responseData The response body data, captured if the agent records server error params params Additional parameters included in an HTTP error metric if the HTTP transaction is an error For requests that fail due to a socket or operating system error, use this method: [NewRelic noticeNetworkFailureForURL:(NSURL *)url httpMethod:(NSString*)httpMethod withTimer:(NRTimer *)timer andFailureCode:(NSInteger)iOSFailureCode]; Copy Parameters include: Parameter Description url The URL of the request httpMethod The method type of the request; for example, POST, GET, etc. timer An NRTimer that timed the network request iOSFailureCode The failure code Failure codes are interpreted as NSURLError* code. To view a complete list of supported codes, see NRConstants.h. Instrument your Swift code To have your own Swift code appear in interaction code breakdowns and timelines: Add a startTracingMethod() call to the beginning of your method. Add a endTracingMethodWithTimer() call to the end of it. Always include an endTracingMethodWithTimer() call for each startTracingMethod() reference. Include only one set of these commands in a given method. func myMethod(){ let timer = NRTimer(); NewRelic.startTracingMethod(#selector(MyClass.myMethod), object: self, timer: timer, category: NRTraceTypeNone) // … existing code NewRelic.endTracingMethodWithTimer(timer) } Copy If you want your method’s performance to be included in the summary data on the APM Overview page, pass one of the NRTraceType enum values into the startTracingMethod() macro; for example: NewRelic.startTracingMethod(#selector(MyClass.myMethod), object: self, timer: timer, category: NRTraceTypeDatabase) Copy Create and complete Swift interactions By default, an interaction starts when a view controller is pushed. To manually start an interaction, use these API calls: let uniqueIdentifier = NewRelic.startInteraction(withName: \"My Interaction\") Copy This call will automatically begin tracking an interaction trace named My Interaction from the current line. It will also complete any previously running interaction. It returns a unique identifier that can be used to complete that interaction by using this API call: NewRelic.stopCurrentInteraction(uniqueIdentifier) Copy This method will complete the interaction associated with the uniqueIdentifier if that interaction has not already completed automatically. You do not need to call this method. Rename a default Swift interaction By default, the iOS agent will start an interaction trace when a new view controller is displayed. The interactions are named using the format Display <ViewController>. To change these default names, implement the @objc func customNewRelicInteractionName() -> String method in your view controller, where the string returned becomes the interaction's name. Set a custom application version with Swift The New Relic iOS SDK allows you to set a custom application version string. Instead of using the string defined in CFBundleShortVersionString, call the NewRelic.setApplicationVersion() method, and pass along the custom application version before calling NewRelic.startWithApplicationToken();. NewRelic.setApplicationVersion(String appVersion) Copy Set a custom build identifier with Swift As of version 5.1.0 of the New Relic iOS SDK, an API method allows you to set a custom build identifier that is displayed next to the application version in the Crash details page. Instead of using the CFBundleVersion string defined in Xcode, call the NewRelic.setApplicationBuild() method, and pass along the custom build identifier.

For a general overview of mobile monitoring functionality, see Introduction to mobile monitoring. Compatibility and requirements Before you install the iOS agent, review the compatibility and requirements. Install the agent As part of the installation process, New Relic automatically generates an application token. This is a 40-character hexadecimal string for authenticating each mobile app that you monitor. There are two ways you can install the iOS agent: We recommend you install and configure the iOS agent using the CocoaPods installation method. You can also manually install and configure the iOS agent by adding the New Relic framework to your app. Extend your instrumentation After you install the agent, you can extend the agent's default instrumentation with various types of custom data: To access: In the mobile UI: In New Relic One dashboards: Custom data Create and record custom events, interaction traces, and attributes to add details to your existing data and traces. You can also query the custom events that you created in New Relic One dashboards and NRQL. Network requests Enable the MobileRequest event feature so you can perform a full network analysis. To further investigate network request error rates and response times, query MobileRequest and MobileRequestError events. Crash analysis Review detailed information using groups and filters to analyze trends that lead to crashes. To view more information about crashes, create NRQL queries to review Insights charts related to crash data. iOS SDK API Use the iOS SDK API to instrument parts of your code that are not instrumented by default. Then, view those custom events and attributes in New Relic Insights. Handled exceptions Report exceptions so you can identify factors creating a poor mobile app experience. To further improve performance, review MobileHandledException event records in New Relic Insights. Breadcrumbs Boost the level of detail in crash event trails by adding breadcrumbs. Then, query MobileBreadcrumbs events to see all breadcrumbs or just breadcrumbs related to crashes. Troubleshoot your installation If the agent isn't reporting data, try these troubleshooting suggestions.",

Important Always include a _STOP for each _START, and only include one set of these commands in a given method. The trace system will automatically pick up the class and method name, and report performance metrics for your method to New Relic. - (void)myMethod { NR_TRACE_METHOD_START(0); // … existing code NR_TRACE_METHOD_STOP; } Copy If you are not using ARC, use this version of the _STOP macro to avoid memory leaks: NR_NONARC_TRACE_METHOD_STOP; Copy If you want your method’s performance to be included in the summary data on the APM Overview page, pass one of the NRTraceType enum values into the _START macro; for example: NR_TRACE_METHOD_START(NRTraceTypeDatabase); Copy Create and complete interactions By default, an interaction starts when a view controller is pushed. To manually start an interaction with Objective-C, use these API calls: NSString* uniqueIdentifier = NR_START_NAMED_INTERACTION(@\"name\"); Copy This macro will automatically begin tracking the name interaction trace from the current line. It will also complete any previously running interaction. It returns a unique identifier that can be used to complete that interaction by using this API call: NR_INTERACTION_STOP(uniqueIdentifier); Copy This macro will complete the interaction associated with the uniqueIdentifier if that interaction has not already completed automatically. You do not need to call this method. Rename a default interaction By default, the iOS agent will start an interaction trace when a new view controller is displayed. The interactions are named using the format Display <ViewController>. To change these default names with Objective-C, implement the - (NSString*) customNewRelicInteractionName instance method in your view controller, where the string returned becomes the interaction's name. Set a custom application version The New Relic iOS SDK allows you to set a custom application version string with Objective-C. Instead of using the string defined in CFBundleShortVersionString, call the +[NewRelic setApplicationVersion:] method and pass along the custom application version before calling +[NewRelic startWithApplicationToken:]; [NewRelic setApplicationVersion:(NSString*) appVersion]; Copy Set a custom build identifier As of version 5.1.0 of the New Relic iOS SDK, an API method allows you to set a custom build identifier that is displayed next to the application version in the Crash details page. Instead of using the CFBundleVersion string defined in Xcode with Objective-C, call the +[NewRelic setApplicationBuild:] method, and pass along the custom build identifier. [NewRelic setApplicationBuild:(NSString*) buildNumber]; Copy Create custom metrics Custom metrics can help track high level events specific to your application. With the recordMetric API, you can record arbitrary numerical data and named events with Objective-C and Swift. You can also use several API calls to record custom metrics that provide different levels of detail. Objective-C: Report custom attributes and events Use methods in the NewRelic object to report custom attributes and events. For details about the available methods for custom attributes and events with Objective-C, see the iOS SDK API reference. Methods that return BOOL results return YES if they succeed, or NO if the operation did not complete. These methods are available in versions 5.0.0 or higher of the New Relic iOS SDK. The SDK can store up to 128 user-defined custom attributes at a time. If you attempt to store more than 128 attributes, the SDK returns NO. Custom attributes names should use the simplest format needed, and New Relic recommends single word attributes, containing no spaces. Attribute phrases can be formatted in camel case, so My Custom Attribute is better specified as myCustomAttribute. As with custom metrics: Avoid using the characters / ] [ | * when naming things. Avoid multi-byte characters. Objective-C: Track custom network requests If you can express a transactional network request in terms similar to an HTTP request, you can track it. Use URLs that are well-formed and do not include highly variable paths or hostnames. For requests that complete, use this method: [NewRelic noticeNetworkRequestForURL:(NSURL*)url httpMethod:(NSString*)httpMethod withTimer:(NRTimer *)timer responseHeaders:(NSDictionary *)headers statusCode:(NSInteger)httpStatusCode bytesSent:(NSUInteger)bytesSent bytesReceived:(NSUInteger)bytesReceived responseData:(NSData *)responseData andParams:(NSDictionary *)params]; Copy Parameters include: Parameter Description url The URL of the request httpMethod The method type of the request; for example, POST, GET, etc. timer An NRTimer that timed the network request headers A dictionary containing the HTTP response headers, if available httpStatusCode The response status code If the httpStatusCode is greater than or equal to 400, the agent will record a server error and may capture the responseData body if provided. bytesSent The size of the request body bytesReceived The size of the responseBody responseData The response body data, captured if the agent records server error params params Additional parameters included in an HTTP error metric if the HTTP transaction is an error For requests that fail due to a socket or operating system error, use this method: [NewRelic noticeNetworkFailureForURL:(NSURL *)url httpMethod:(NSString*)httpMethod withTimer:(NRTimer *)timer andFailureCode:(NSInteger)iOSFailureCode]; Copy Parameters include: Parameter Description url The URL of the request httpMethod The method type of the request; for example, POST, GET, etc. timer An NRTimer that timed the network request iOSFailureCode The failure code Failure codes are interpreted as NSURLError* code. To view a complete list of supported codes, see NRConstants.h. Instrument your Swift code To have your own Swift code appear in interaction code breakdowns and timelines: Add a startTracingMethod() call to the beginning of your method. Add a endTracingMethodWithTimer() call to the end of it. Always include an endTracingMethodWithTimer() call for each startTracingMethod() reference. Include only one set of these commands in a given method. func myMethod(){ let timer = NRTimer(); NewRelic.startTracingMethod(#selector(MyClass.myMethod), object: self, timer: timer, category: NRTraceTypeNone) // … existing code NewRelic.endTracingMethodWithTimer(timer) } Copy If you want your method’s performance to be included in the summary data on the APM Overview page, pass one of the NRTraceType enum values into the startTracingMethod() macro; for example: NewRelic.startTracingMethod(#selector(MyClass.myMethod), object: self, timer: timer, category: NRTraceTypeDatabase) Copy Create and complete Swift interactions By default, an interaction starts when a view controller is pushed. To manually start an interaction, use these API calls: let uniqueIdentifier = NewRelic.startInteraction(withName: \"My Interaction\") Copy This call will automatically begin tracking an interaction trace named My Interaction from the current line. It will also complete any previously running interaction. It returns a unique identifier that can be used to complete that interaction by using this API call: NewRelic.stopCurrentInteraction(uniqueIdentifier) Copy This method will complete the interaction associated with the uniqueIdentifier if that interaction has not already completed automatically. You do not need to call this method. Rename a default Swift interaction By default, the iOS agent will start an interaction trace when a new view controller is displayed. The interactions are named using the format Display <ViewController>.

For a general overview of mobile monitoring functionality, see Introduction to mobile monitoring. Compatibility and requirements Before you install the iOS agent, review the compatibility and requirements. Install the agent As part of the installation process, New Relic automatically generates an application token. This is a 40-character hexadecimal string for authenticating each mobile app that you monitor. There are two ways you can install the iOS agent: We recommend you install and configure the iOS agent using the CocoaPods installation method. You can also manually install and configure the iOS agent by adding the New Relic framework to your app. Extend your instrumentation After you install the agent, you can extend the agent's default instrumentation with various types of custom data: To access: In the mobile UI: In New Relic One dashboards: Custom data Create and record custom events, interaction traces, and attributes to add details to your existing data and traces. You can also query the custom events that you created in New Relic One dashboards and NRQL. Network requests Enable the MobileRequest event feature so you can perform a full network analysis. To further investigate network request error rates and response times, query MobileRequest and MobileRequestError events. Crash analysis Review detailed information using groups and filters to analyze trends that lead to crashes. To view more information about crashes, create NRQL queries to review Insights charts related to crash data. iOS SDK API Use the iOS SDK API to instrument parts of your code that are not instrumented by default. Then, view those custom events and attributes in New Relic Insights. Handled exceptions Report exceptions so you can identify factors creating a poor mobile app experience. To further improve performance, review MobileHandledException event records in New Relic Insights. Breadcrumbs Boost the level of detail in crash event trails by adding breadcrumbs. Then, query MobileBreadcrumbs events to see all breadcrumbs or just breadcrumbs related to crashes. Troubleshoot your installation If the agent isn't reporting data, try these troubleshooting suggestions.",

Instead of using the CFBundleVersion string defined in Xcode, call the NewRelic.setApplicationBuild() method, and pass along the custom build identifier. NewRelic.setApplicationBuild(buildNumber) Copy Create custom metrics with Swift Custom metrics can help track high level events specific to your application. With the recordMetric API, you can record arbitrary numerical data and named events with Objective-C and Swift. You can also use several API calls to record custom metrics that provide different levels of detail. Swift: Report custom attributes and events Use methods in the NewRelic object to report custom attributes and events. For details about the available methods for custom attributes and events with Swift, see the iOS SDK API reference. Methods that return BOOL results return YES if they succeed, or NO if the operation did not complete. These methods are available in versions 5.0.0 or higher of the New Relic iOS SDK. The SDK can store up to 128 user-defined custom attributes at a time. If you attempt to store more than 128 attributes, the SDK returns NO. Custom attributes names should use the simplest format needed, and New Relic recommends single word attributes, containing no spaces. Attribute phrases can be formatted in camel case, so My Custom Attribute is better specified as myCustomAttribute. As with custom metrics: Avoid using the characters / ] [ | * when naming things. Avoid multi-byte characters. Swift: Track custom network requests If you can express a transactional network request in terms similar to an HTTP request, you can track it. Use URLs that are well-formed and do not include highly variable paths or hostnames. For requests that complete, use this method: NewRelic.noticeNetworkRequestForURL(url: NSURL!, httpMethod: String!, withTimer: NRTimer!, responseHeaders:[NSObject : AnyObject]!, statusCode: Int, bytesSent: UInt, bytesReceived: UInt, responseData: NSData!, andParams: [NSObject : AnyObject]!) Copy Parameters include: Parameter Description url The URL of the request httpMethod The method type of the request; for example, POST, GET, etc. timer An NRTimer that timed the network request headers A dictionary containing the HTTP response headers, if available httpStatusCode The response status code If the httpStatusCode is greater than or equal to 400, the agent will record a server error and may capture the responseData body if provided. bytesSent The size of the request body bytesReceived The size of the responseBody responseData The response body data, captured if the agent records Server error params params Additional parameters included in an HTTP error metric if the HTTP transaction is an error For requests that fail due to a socket or operating system error, use this method: NewRelic.noticeNetworkFailureForURL(url: NSURL!, httpMethod: NSString!, withTimer: NRTimer!, andFailureCode: Int) Copy Parameters include: Parameter Description url The URL of the request httpMethod The method type of the request; for example, POST, GET, etc. timer An NRTimer that timed the network request iOSFailureCode The failure code Failure codes are interpreted as NSURLError* code.

For a general overview of mobile monitoring functionality, see Introduction to mobile monitoring. Compatibility and requirements Before you install the iOS agent, review the compatibility and requirements. Install the agent As part of the installation process, New Relic automatically generates an application token. This is a 40-character hexadecimal string for authenticating each mobile app that you monitor. There are two ways you can install the iOS agent: We recommend you install and configure the iOS agent using the CocoaPods installation method. You can also manually install and configure the iOS agent by adding the New Relic framework to your app. Extend your instrumentation After you install the agent, you can extend the agent's default instrumentation with various types of custom data: To access: In the mobile UI: In New Relic One dashboards: Custom data Create and record custom events, interaction traces, and attributes to add details to your existing data and traces. You can also query the custom events that you created in New Relic One dashboards and NRQL. Network requests Enable the MobileRequest event feature so you can perform a full network analysis. To further investigate network request error rates and response times, query MobileRequest and MobileRequestError events. Crash analysis Review detailed information using groups and filters to analyze trends that lead to crashes. To view more information about crashes, create NRQL queries to review Insights charts related to crash data. iOS SDK API Use the iOS SDK API to instrument parts of your code that are not instrumented by default. Then, view those custom events and attributes in New Relic Insights. Handled exceptions Report exceptions so you can identify factors creating a poor mobile app experience. To further improve performance, review MobileHandledException event records in New Relic Insights. Breadcrumbs Boost the level of detail in crash event trails by adding breadcrumbs. Then, query MobileBreadcrumbs events to see all breadcrumbs or just breadcrumbs related to crashes.

      "body": "Your app's dSYM files are stored in Xcode's dSYM archive path folder. This is the folder where the iOS agent gets the dSYM files that are used to symbolicate your crash reports. New Relic provides a post-build script as part of the iOS agent's install process and the tvOS agent's install process. This script automatically uploads your app's dSYM files. Automatic script The script automatically uploads dSYM files only for release builds. Non-release builds must upload their files either manually or through the mobile monitoring UI. Bitcode-enabled apps have their dSYM files generated by Apple. You must download the dSYM files for Bitcode-enabled apps from Apple and upload them to New Relic. If you see unreadable machine code in the Crashes page, your dSYM files may not be uploaded correctly. In some cases, you may need to manually upload dSYM files. The automatic script uses Python 2. As of October 2019 with macOS 10.15 (Catalina), Python won't be installed by default. If you're using the automatic script (recommended), you may need to manually install Python 2. If you're using Homebrew, see Python on Homebrew. Identify missing dSYMs When a Bitcode-enabled app is uploaded to Apple for App Store review or ad-hoc distribution, dSYMs need to be manually downloaded from Apple and uploaded to New Relic to allow the mobile crash reports to be properly symbolicated. These dSYMs can be downloaded through the archives organizer in Xcode within several minutes of uploading the app. In this situation follow the procedures to find the archive and download dSYMs. If an app is missing a dSYM file, you'll see three indicators in the mobile monitoring UI: Banner notification: A banner warning appears on the Crash report page. The warning reads: We were unable to locate your dsym. Copy Upload prompt: From the Crash type summary page you will be automatically prompted to upload a dSYM file if it is missing. Machine code: The crash stack trace on the Crash report page displays machine code and not a human-readable error message. Upload dSYM files through the mobile monitoring UI You can easily upload your dSYM files directly from the New Relic One UI. The maximum file size is 600 MB. To upload your dSYM files: Go to one.newrelic.com and click Mobile. Then select your app from the list. View Crash analysis. Select a specific crash from the Crash types list. Click Upload dSYM. You can either drag and drop your dSYMs directly, or select the file form your computer. Manually upload dSYM files In some circumstances, New Relic's automatic upload of dSYM files may fail. If a dSYM upload is attempted and fails, it creates a build error with a detailed message. For example, if there's a network failure and the dSYM upload isn't completed, Xcode will report an error. For additional information about how New Relic handles dSYM uploads, see New Relic's Online Technical Community. If the automatic upload fails, you can manually upload your dSYM file. If you have multiple dSYM files, they can be within a single zip with a maximum file size of 600 MB. The YOUR_NEW_RELIC_APPLICATION_TOKEN value in the commands below is the same key used for +[NewRelic startWithApplicationToken:] (in Objective-C) or NewRelic.start(withApplicationToken:) (in Swift). To manually upload your dSYM files: Via Python script (agent versions 6.0.0 or higher) In iOS agent versions 6.0.0 or higher, the agent includes a Python script that automatically processes and uploads symbols. You can call this script from the command line: NewRelicAgent.framework/Resources/generateMap.py \"DSYM_ARCHIVE_PATH\" \"YOUR_NEW_RELIC_APPLICATION_TOKEN\" Copy Via command line To manually upload individual dSYM files from the command line: Zip up your dSYM file or files using the following command. Replace ~ /ZIPPED_DSYM_PATH with your new dSYM archive path and file name (for example, Users/my-name/desktop). Also replace ~ /dSYM_PATH with your existing dSYM file path. /usr/bin/zip --recurse-paths --quiet \"~/ZIPPED_DSYM_PATH\" \"~/dSYM_PATH\" Copy Upload the dSYM zip file using the following command: For US accounts: curl -F dsym=@\"~/DSYM_ZIP_PATH\" -H \"X-APP-LICENSE-KEY: YOUR_NEW_RELIC_APPLICATION_TOKEN\" https://mobile-symbol-upload.newrelic.com/symbol Copy For EU accounts: curl -F dsym=@\"~/DSYM_ZIP_PATH\" -H \"X-APP-LICENSE-KEY: YOUR_NEW_RELIC_APPLICATION_TOKEN\" https://mobile-symbol-upload.eu01.nr-data.net/symbol Copy Troubleshooting Auto-upload failure If a dSYM auto-upload failed, the Report Navigator may have a fully formed cURL command. You can use this cURL command to reattempt an upload. Depending on the error, you may also need to follow some of the dSYM manual upload steps. Here is an example of a successful dSYM upload in the Report Navigator: Example: A successful dSYM upload in the Report Navigator. Missing dSYMs If dSYM files are missing, you may need to check Xcode build settings to ensure the file is being generated.

When an iOS or tvOS application crashes, the operating system creates a crash report and stores it on the device. New Relic uploads this report the next time the app launches. Using this report and any relevant dSYM files, the crash report includes the complete stack trace with human-readable information. You can then log into New Relic and see each crash, including the method and line where it crashed, plus device and environment details. dSYM files When you create a release build of an iOS or tvOS application, the names of methods and classes are stripped, leaving only machine-readable memory addresses. When the application crashes, the stack trace consists of this machine-readable code. A dSYM file is an Xcode project file for debug symbols. It contains the debugging symbols that allow for translation of the initial crash report to human-readable information. This process is known as symbolication. New Relic has dynamic framework support for dSYM uploading. If your app uses a dynamic framework with multiple dSYM files, New Relic automatically uploads and uses those files. For more information, see Retrieve and download dSYMs or Upload dSYM files. Debug the crash reporter Crash reporting is enabled by default, but there are some circumstances where it will be disabled: If the debugger is enabled: There can only be one uncaught exception handler registered at a time per application. If running with the debugger attached, New Relic will not capture and report crashes.

      "body": "Your app's dSYM files are stored in Xcode's dSYM archive path folder. This is the folder where the iOS agent gets the dSYM files that are used to symbolicate your crash reports. New Relic provides a post-build script as part of the iOS agent's install process and the tvOS agent's install process. This script automatically uploads your app's dSYM files. Automatic script The script automatically uploads dSYM files only for release builds. Non-release builds must upload their files either manually or through the mobile monitoring UI. Bitcode-enabled apps have their dSYM files generated by Apple. You must download the dSYM files for Bitcode-enabled apps from Apple and upload them to New Relic. If you see unreadable machine code in the Crashes page, your dSYM files may not be uploaded correctly. In some cases, you may need to manually upload dSYM files. The automatic script uses Python 2. As of October 2019 with macOS 10.15 (Catalina), Python won't be installed by default. If you're using the automatic script (recommended), you may need to manually install Python 2. If you're using Homebrew, see Python on Homebrew. Identify missing dSYMs When a Bitcode-enabled app is uploaded to Apple for App Store review or ad-hoc distribution, dSYMs need to be manually downloaded from Apple and uploaded to New Relic to allow the mobile crash reports to be properly symbolicated. These dSYMs can be downloaded through the archives organizer in Xcode within several minutes of uploading the app. In this situation follow the procedures to find the archive and download dSYMs. If an app is missing a dSYM file, you'll see three indicators in the mobile monitoring UI: Banner notification: A banner warning appears on the Crash report page. The warning reads: We were unable to locate your dsym. Copy Upload prompt: From the Crash type summary page you will be automatically prompted to upload a dSYM file if it is missing. Machine code: The crash stack trace on the Crash report page displays machine code and not a human-readable error message. Upload dSYM files through the mobile monitoring UI You can easily upload your dSYM files directly from the New Relic One UI. The maximum file size is 600 MB. To upload your dSYM files: Go to one.newrelic.com and click Mobile. Then select your app from the list. View Crash analysis. Select a specific crash from the Crash types list. Click Upload dSYM. You can either drag and drop your dSYMs directly, or select the file form your computer. Manually upload dSYM files In some circumstances, New Relic's automatic upload of dSYM files may fail. If a dSYM upload is attempted and fails, it creates a build error with a detailed message. For example, if there's a network failure and the dSYM upload isn't completed, Xcode will report an error. For additional information about how New Relic handles dSYM uploads, see New Relic's Online Technical Community. If the automatic upload fails, you can manually upload your dSYM file. If you have multiple dSYM files, they can be within a single zip with a maximum file size of 600 MB. The YOUR_NEW_RELIC_APPLICATION_TOKEN value in the commands below is the same key used for +[NewRelic startWithApplicationToken:] (in Objective-C) or NewRelic.start(withApplicationToken:) (in Swift). To manually upload your dSYM files: Via Python script (agent versions 6.0.0 or higher) In iOS agent versions 6.0.0 or higher, the agent includes a Python script that automatically processes and uploads symbols. You can call this script from the command line: NewRelicAgent.framework/Resources/generateMap.py \"DSYM_ARCHIVE_PATH\" \"YOUR_NEW_RELIC_APPLICATION_TOKEN\" Copy Via command line To manually upload individual dSYM files from the command line: Zip up your dSYM file or files using the following command. Replace ~ /ZIPPED_DSYM_PATH with your new dSYM archive path and file name (for example, Users/my-name/desktop). Also replace ~ /dSYM_PATH with your existing dSYM file path. /usr/bin/zip --recurse-paths --quiet \"~/ZIPPED_DSYM_PATH\" \"~/dSYM_PATH\" Copy Upload the dSYM zip file using the following command: For US accounts: curl -F dsym=@\"~/DSYM_ZIP_PATH\" -H \"X-APP-LICENSE-KEY: YOUR_NEW_RELIC_APPLICATION_TOKEN\" https://mobile-symbol-upload.newrelic.com/symbol Copy For EU accounts: curl -F dsym=@\"~/DSYM_ZIP_PATH\" -H \"X-APP-LICENSE-KEY: YOUR_NEW_RELIC_APPLICATION_TOKEN\" https://mobile-symbol-upload.eu01.nr-data.net/symbol Copy Troubleshooting Auto-upload failure If a dSYM auto-upload failed, the Report Navigator may have a fully formed cURL command. You can use this cURL command to reattempt an upload. Depending on the error, you may also need to follow some of the dSYM manual upload steps. Here is an example of a successful dSYM upload in the Report Navigator: Example: A successful dSYM upload in the Report Navigator. Missing dSYMs If dSYM files are missing, you may need to check Xcode build settings to ensure the file is being generated. Frameworks which are built locally have separate build settings and may need to be updated as well.

      "body": "Use the iOS SDK API to add custom data. For example: Instrument your own code. Start and stop interaction traces from events in your mobile app. Record custom metrics. Send custom attributes and events to Insights. Track networking from libraries not supported automatically. Set a custom identifier value with Objective-C or Swift to associate user sessions with analysis events and attributes (iOS SDK version 5.9.0 or higher). Caution Tracing is heavily optimized, but it does impose a performance overhead. Avoid instrumenting methods that are expected to be called hundreds of times. Install the SDK Ensure you have your app instrumented with the latest iOS SDK by going to one.newrelic.com > Add more data and following the instructions for iOS. This document contains the iOS SDK instrumentation requirements for: Objective C Swift For details about the available methods for custom attributes and events you can send to to New Relic Insights, see the iOS SDK API reference. You can also configure feature flags for: Objective-C Swift Automatically instrumented classes and methods The following methods (for the listed classes and their sub-classes) are already instrumented by New Relic. You do not need to add custom instrumentation to trace them. Classes Methods automatically instrumented by New Relic UIViewController viewDidLoad: viewWillAppear: viewDidAppear: viewWillDisappear: viewDidDisappear: viewWillLayoutSubviews: viewDidLayoutSubviews: UIImage imageNamed: imageWithContentsOfFile: imageWithData: imageWithData:scale: initWithContentsOfFile: initWithData: initWithData:scale: NSJSONSerialization JSONObjectWithData:options:error: JSONObjectWithStream:options:error: dataWithJSONObject:options:error: writeJSONObject:toStream:options:error: NSManagedObjectContext executeFetchRequest:error: processPendingChanges The agent aggregates performance for various methods into summary metrics that appear in the Interactions page. Summary categories include: View loading UI layout Database Images JSON Network Instrument your Objective-C code To have your own Objective-C code appear in interaction code breakdowns and timelines, add a _START call to the beginning of your method and a _STOP call to the end of it. Important Always include a _STOP for each _START, and only include one set of these commands in a given method. The trace system will automatically pick up the class and method name, and report performance metrics for your method to New Relic. - (void)myMethod { NR_TRACE_METHOD_START(0); // … existing code NR_TRACE_METHOD_STOP; } Copy If you are not using ARC, use this version of the _STOP macro to avoid memory leaks: NR_NONARC_TRACE_METHOD_STOP; Copy If you want your method’s performance to be included in the summary data on the APM Overview page, pass one of the NRTraceType enum values into the _START macro; for example: NR_TRACE_METHOD_START(NRTraceTypeDatabase); Copy Create and complete interactions By default, an interaction starts when a view controller is pushed. To manually start an interaction with Objective-C, use these API calls: NSString* uniqueIdentifier = NR_START_NAMED_INTERACTION(@\"name\"); Copy This macro will automatically begin tracking the name interaction trace from the current line. It will also complete any previously running interaction. It returns a unique identifier that can be used to complete that interaction by using this API call: NR_INTERACTION_STOP(uniqueIdentifier); Copy This macro will complete the interaction associated with the uniqueIdentifier if that interaction has not already completed automatically. You do not need to call this method. Rename a default interaction By default, the iOS agent will start an interaction trace when a new view controller is displayed. The interactions are named using the format Display <ViewController>. To change these default names with Objective-C, implement the - (NSString*) customNewRelicInteractionName instance method in your view controller, where the string returned becomes the interaction's name. Set a custom application version The New Relic iOS SDK allows you to set a custom application version string with Objective-C. Instead of using the string defined in CFBundleShortVersionString, call the +[NewRelic setApplicationVersion:] method and pass along the custom application version before calling +[NewRelic startWithApplicationToken:]; [NewRelic setApplicationVersion:(NSString*) appVersion]; Copy Set a custom build identifier As of version 5.1.0 of the New Relic iOS SDK, an API method allows you to set a custom build identifier that is displayed next to the application version in the Crash details page. Instead of using the CFBundleVersion string defined in Xcode with Objective-C, call the +[NewRelic setApplicationBuild:] method, and pass along the custom build identifier. [NewRelic setApplicationBuild:(NSString*) buildNumber]; Copy Create custom metrics Custom metrics can help track high level events specific to your application. With the recordMetric API, you can record arbitrary numerical data and named events with Objective-C and Swift. You can also use several API calls to record custom metrics that provide different levels of detail. Objective-C: Report custom attributes and events Use methods in the NewRelic object to report custom attributes and events. For details about the available methods for custom attributes and events with Objective-C, see the iOS SDK API reference. Methods that return BOOL results return YES if they succeed, or NO if the operation did not complete. These methods are available in versions 5.0.0 or higher of the New Relic iOS SDK. The SDK can store up to 128 user-defined custom attributes at a time. If you attempt to store more than 128 attributes, the SDK returns NO. Custom attributes names should use the simplest format needed, and New Relic recommends single word attributes, containing no spaces. Attribute phrases can be formatted in camel case, so My Custom Attribute is better specified as myCustomAttribute. As with custom metrics: Avoid using the characters / ] [ | * when naming things. Avoid multi-byte characters. Objective-C: Track custom network requests If you can express a transactional network request in terms similar to an HTTP request, you can track it. Use URLs that are well-formed and do not include highly variable paths or hostnames. For requests that complete, use this method: [NewRelic noticeNetworkRequestForURL:(NSURL*)url httpMethod:(NSString*)httpMethod withTimer:(NRTimer *)timer responseHeaders:(NSDictionary *)headers statusCode:(NSInteger)httpStatusCode bytesSent:(NSUInteger)bytesSent bytesReceived:(NSUInteger)bytesReceived responseData:(NSData *)responseData andParams:(NSDictionary *)params]; Copy Parameters include: Parameter Description url The URL of the request httpMethod The method type of the request; for example, POST, GET, etc. timer An NRTimer that timed the network request headers A dictionary containing the HTTP response headers, if available httpStatusCode The response status code If the httpStatusCode is greater than or equal to 400, the agent will record a server error and may capture the responseData body if provided. bytesSent The size of the request body bytesReceived The size of the responseBody responseData The response body data, captured if the agent records server error params params Additional parameters included in an HTTP error metric if the HTTP transaction is an error For requests that fail due to a socket or operating system error, use this method: [NewRelic noticeNetworkFailureForURL:(NSURL *)url httpMethod:(NSString*)httpMethod withTimer:(NRTimer *)timer andFailureCode:(NSInteger)iOSFailureCode]; Copy Parameters include: Parameter Description url The URL of the request httpMethod The method type of the request; for example, POST, GET, etc. timer An NRTimer that timed the network request iOSFailureCode The failure code Failure codes are interpreted as NSURLError* code. To view a complete list of supported codes, see NRConstants.h. Instrument your Swift code To have your own Swift code appear in interaction code breakdowns and timelines: Add a startTracingMethod() call to the beginning of your method. Add a endTracingMethodWithTimer() call to the end of it. Always include an endTracingMethodWithTimer() call for each startTracingMethod() reference. Include only one set of these commands in a given method. func myMethod(){ let timer = NRTimer(); NewRelic.startTracingMethod(#selector(MyClass.myMethod), object: self, timer: timer, category: NRTraceTypeNone) // … existing code NewRelic.endTracingMethodWithTimer(timer) } Copy If you want your method’s performance to be included in the summary data on the APM Overview page, pass one of the NRTraceType enum values into the startTracingMethod() macro; for example: NewRelic.startTracingMethod(#selector(MyClass.myMethod), object: self, timer: timer, category: NRTraceTypeDatabase) Copy Create and complete Swift interactions By default, an interaction starts when a view controller is pushed. To manually start an interaction, use these API calls: let uniqueIdentifier = NewRelic.startInteraction(withName: \"My Interaction\") Copy This call will automatically begin tracking an interaction trace named My Interaction from the current line. It will also complete any previously running interaction. It returns a unique identifier that can be used to complete that interaction by using this API call: NewRelic.stopCurrentInteraction(uniqueIdentifier) Copy This method will complete the interaction associated with the uniqueIdentifier if that interaction has not already completed automatically. You do not need to call this method. Rename a default Swift interaction By default, the iOS agent will start an interaction trace when a new view controller is displayed. The interactions are named using the format Display <ViewController>. To change these default names, implement the @objc func customNewRelicInteractionName() -> String method in your view controller, where the string returned becomes the interaction's name. Set a custom application version with Swift The New Relic iOS SDK allows you to set a custom application version string. Instead of using the string defined in CFBundleShortVersionString, call the NewRelic.setApplicationVersion() method, and pass along the custom application version before calling NewRelic.startWithApplicationToken();. NewRelic.setApplicationVersion(String appVersion) Copy Set a custom build identifier with Swift As of version 5.1.0 of the New Relic iOS SDK, an API method allows you to set a custom build identifier that is displayed next to the application version in the Crash details page. Instead of using the CFBundleVersion string defined in Xcode, call the NewRelic.setApplicationBuild() method, and pass along the custom build identifier. NewRelic.setApplicationBuild(buildNumber) Copy Create custom metrics with Swift Custom metrics can help track high level events specific to your application. With the recordMetric API, you can record arbitrary numerical data and named events with Objective-C and Swift. You can also use several API calls to record custom metrics that provide different levels of detail. Swift: Report custom attributes and events Use methods in the NewRelic object to report custom attributes and events. For details about the available methods for custom attributes and events with Swift, see the iOS SDK API reference. Methods that return BOOL results return YES if they succeed, or NO if the operation did not complete. These methods are available in versions 5.0.0 or higher of the New Relic iOS SDK. The SDK can store up to 128 user-defined custom attributes at a time. If you attempt to store more than 128 attributes, the SDK returns NO. Custom attributes names should use the simplest format needed, and New Relic recommends single word attributes, containing no spaces. Attribute phrases can be formatted in camel case, so My Custom Attribute is better specified as myCustomAttribute. As with custom metrics: Avoid using the characters / ] [ | * when naming things. Avoid multi-byte characters. Swift: Track custom network requests If you can express a transactional network request in terms similar to an HTTP request, you can track it. Use URLs that are well-formed and do not include highly variable paths or hostnames. For requests that complete, use this method: NewRelic.noticeNetworkRequestForURL(url: NSURL!, httpMethod: String!, withTimer: NRTimer!, responseHeaders:[NSObject : AnyObject]!, statusCode: Int, bytesSent: UInt, bytesReceived: UInt, responseData: NSData!, andParams: [NSObject : AnyObject]!) Copy Parameters include: Parameter Description url The URL of the request httpMethod The method type of the request; for example, POST, GET, etc. timer An NRTimer that timed the network request headers A dictionary containing the HTTP response headers, if available httpStatusCode The response status code If the httpStatusCode is greater than or equal to 400, the agent will record a server error and may capture the responseData body if provided. bytesSent The size of the request body bytesReceived The size of the responseBody responseData The response body data, captured if the agent records Server error params params Additional parameters included in an HTTP error metric if the HTTP transaction is an error For requests that fail due to a socket or operating system error, use this method: NewRelic.noticeNetworkFailureForURL(url: NSURL!, httpMethod: NSString!, withTimer: NRTimer!, andFailureCode: Int) Copy Parameters include: Parameter Description url The URL of the request httpMethod The method type of the request; for example, POST, GET, etc. timer An NRTimer that timed the network request iOSFailureCode The failure code Failure codes are interpreted as NSURLError* code.

For a general overview of mobile monitoring functionality, see Introduction to mobile monitoring. Compatibility and requirements Before you install the iOS agent, review the compatibility and requirements. Install the agent As part of the installation process, New Relic automatically generates an application token. This is a 40-character hexadecimal string for authenticating each mobile app that you monitor. There are two ways you can install the iOS agent: We recommend you install and configure the iOS agent using the CocoaPods installation method. You can also manually install and configure the iOS agent by adding the New Relic framework to your app. Extend your instrumentation After you install the agent, you can extend the agent's default instrumentation with various types of custom data: To access: In the mobile UI: In New Relic One dashboards: Custom data Create and record custom events, interaction traces, and attributes to add details to your existing data and traces. You can also query the custom events that you created in New Relic One dashboards and NRQL. Network requests Enable the MobileRequest event feature so you can perform a full network analysis. To further investigate network request error rates and response times, query MobileRequest and MobileRequestError events. Crash analysis Review detailed information using groups and filters to analyze trends that lead to crashes. To view more information about crashes, create NRQL queries to review Insights charts related to crash data. iOS SDK API Use the iOS SDK API to instrument parts of your code that are not instrumented by default. Then, view those custom events and attributes in New Relic Insights. Handled exceptions Report exceptions so you can identify factors creating a poor mobile app experience. To further improve performance, review MobileHandledException event records in New Relic Insights. Breadcrumbs Boost the level of detail in crash event trails by adding breadcrumbs. Then, query MobileBreadcrumbs events to see all breadcrumbs or just breadcrumbs related to crashes. Troubleshoot your installation If the agent isn't reporting data, try these troubleshooting suggestions.",

      "body": "Use the iOS SDK API to add custom data. For example: Instrument your own code. Start and stop interaction traces from events in your mobile app. Record custom metrics. Send custom attributes and events to Insights. Track networking from libraries not supported automatically. Set a custom identifier value with Objective-C or Swift to associate user sessions with analysis events and attributes (iOS SDK version 5.9.0 or higher). Caution Tracing is heavily optimized, but it does impose a performance overhead. Avoid instrumenting methods that are expected to be called hundreds of times. Install the SDK Ensure you have your app instrumented with the latest iOS SDK by going to one.newrelic.com > Add more data and following the instructions for iOS. This document contains the iOS SDK instrumentation requirements for: Objective C Swift For details about the available methods for custom attributes and events you can send to to New Relic Insights, see the iOS SDK API reference. You can also configure feature flags for: Objective-C Swift Automatically instrumented classes and methods The following methods (for the listed classes and their sub-classes) are already instrumented by New Relic. You do not need to add custom instrumentation to trace them. Classes Methods automatically instrumented by New Relic UIViewController viewDidLoad: viewWillAppear: viewDidAppear: viewWillDisappear: viewDidDisappear: viewWillLayoutSubviews: viewDidLayoutSubviews: UIImage imageNamed: imageWithContentsOfFile: imageWithData: imageWithData:scale: initWithContentsOfFile: initWithData: initWithData:scale: NSJSONSerialization JSONObjectWithData:options:error: JSONObjectWithStream:options:error: dataWithJSONObject:options:error: writeJSONObject:toStream:options:error: NSManagedObjectContext executeFetchRequest:error: processPendingChanges The agent aggregates performance for various methods into summary metrics that appear in the Interactions page. Summary categories include: View loading UI layout Database Images JSON Network Instrument your Objective-C code To have your own Objective-C code appear in interaction code breakdowns and timelines, add a _START call to the beginning of your method and a _STOP call to the end of it. Important Always include a _STOP for each _START, and only include one set of these commands in a given method. The trace system will automatically pick up the class and method name, and report performance metrics for your method to New Relic. - (void)myMethod { NR_TRACE_METHOD_START(0); // … existing code NR_TRACE_METHOD_STOP; } Copy If you are not using ARC, use this version of the _STOP macro to avoid memory leaks: NR_NONARC_TRACE_METHOD_STOP; Copy If you want your method’s performance to be included in the summary data on the APM Overview page, pass one of the NRTraceType enum values into the _START macro; for example: NR_TRACE_METHOD_START(NRTraceTypeDatabase); Copy Create and complete interactions By default, an interaction starts when a view controller is pushed. To manually start an interaction with Objective-C, use these API calls: NSString* uniqueIdentifier = NR_START_NAMED_INTERACTION(@\"name\"); Copy This macro will automatically begin tracking the name interaction trace from the current line. It will also complete any previously running interaction. It returns a unique identifier that can be used to complete that interaction by using this API call: NR_INTERACTION_STOP(uniqueIdentifier); Copy This macro will complete the interaction associated with the uniqueIdentifier if that interaction has not already completed automatically. You do not need to call this method. Rename a default interaction By default, the iOS agent will start an interaction trace when a new view controller is displayed. The interactions are named using the format Display <ViewController>. To change these default names with Objective-C, implement the - (NSString*) customNewRelicInteractionName instance method in your view controller, where the string returned becomes the interaction's name. Set a custom application version The New Relic iOS SDK allows you to set a custom application version string with Objective-C. Instead of using the string defined in CFBundleShortVersionString, call the +[NewRelic setApplicationVersion:] method and pass along the custom application version before calling +[NewRelic startWithApplicationToken:]; [NewRelic setApplicationVersion:(NSString*) appVersion]; Copy Set a custom build identifier As of version 5.1.0 of the New Relic iOS SDK, an API method allows you to set a custom build identifier that is displayed next to the application version in the Crash details page. Instead of using the CFBundleVersion string defined in Xcode with Objective-C, call the +[NewRelic setApplicationBuild:] method, and pass along the custom build identifier. [NewRelic setApplicationBuild:(NSString*) buildNumber]; Copy Create custom metrics Custom metrics can help track high level events specific to your application. With the recordMetric API, you can record arbitrary numerical data and named events with Objective-C and Swift. You can also use several API calls to record custom metrics that provide different levels of detail. Objective-C: Report custom attributes and events Use methods in the NewRelic object to report custom attributes and events. For details about the available methods for custom attributes and events with Objective-C, see the iOS SDK API reference. Methods that return BOOL results return YES if they succeed, or NO if the operation did not complete. These methods are available in versions 5.0.0 or higher of the New Relic iOS SDK. The SDK can store up to 128 user-defined custom attributes at a time. If you attempt to store more than 128 attributes, the SDK returns NO. Custom attributes names should use the simplest format needed, and New Relic recommends single word attributes, containing no spaces. Attribute phrases can be formatted in camel case, so My Custom Attribute is better specified as myCustomAttribute. As with custom metrics: Avoid using the characters / ] [ | * when naming things. Avoid multi-byte characters. Objective-C: Track custom network requests If you can express a transactional network request in terms similar to an HTTP request, you can track it. Use URLs that are well-formed and do not include highly variable paths or hostnames. For requests that complete, use this method: [NewRelic noticeNetworkRequestForURL:(NSURL*)url httpMethod:(NSString*)httpMethod withTimer:(NRTimer *)timer responseHeaders:(NSDictionary *)headers statusCode:(NSInteger)httpStatusCode bytesSent:(NSUInteger)bytesSent bytesReceived:(NSUInteger)bytesReceived responseData:(NSData *)responseData andParams:(NSDictionary *)params]; Copy Parameters include: Parameter Description url The URL of the request httpMethod The method type of the request; for example, POST, GET, etc. timer An NRTimer that timed the network request headers A dictionary containing the HTTP response headers, if available httpStatusCode The response status code If the httpStatusCode is greater than or equal to 400, the agent will record a server error and may capture the responseData body if provided. bytesSent The size of the request body bytesReceived The size of the responseBody responseData The response body data, captured if the agent records server error params params Additional parameters included in an HTTP error metric if the HTTP transaction is an error For requests that fail due to a socket or operating system error, use this method: [NewRelic noticeNetworkFailureForURL:(NSURL *)url httpMethod:(NSString*)httpMethod withTimer:(NRTimer *)timer andFailureCode:(NSInteger)iOSFailureCode]; Copy Parameters include: Parameter Description url The URL of the request httpMethod The method type of the request; for example, POST, GET, etc. timer An NRTimer that timed the network request iOSFailureCode The failure code Failure codes are interpreted as NSURLError* code. To view a complete list of supported codes, see NRConstants.h. Instrument your Swift code To have your own Swift code appear in interaction code breakdowns and timelines: Add a startTracingMethod() call to the beginning of your method. Add a endTracingMethodWithTimer() call to the end of it. Always include an endTracingMethodWithTimer() call for each startTracingMethod() reference. Include only one set of these commands in a given method. func myMethod(){ let timer = NRTimer(); NewRelic.startTracingMethod(#selector(MyClass.myMethod), object: self, timer: timer, category: NRTraceTypeNone) // … existing code NewRelic.endTracingMethodWithTimer(timer) } Copy If you want your method’s performance to be included in the summary data on the APM Overview page, pass one of the NRTraceType enum values into the startTracingMethod() macro; for example: NewRelic.startTracingMethod(#selector(MyClass.myMethod), object: self, timer: timer, category: NRTraceTypeDatabase) Copy Create and complete Swift interactions By default, an interaction starts when a view controller is pushed. To manually start an interaction, use these API calls: let uniqueIdentifier = NewRelic.startInteraction(withName: \"My Interaction\") Copy This call will automatically begin tracking an interaction trace named My Interaction from the current line. It will also complete any previously running interaction. It returns a unique identifier that can be used to complete that interaction by using this API call: NewRelic.stopCurrentInteraction(uniqueIdentifier) Copy This method will complete the interaction associated with the uniqueIdentifier if that interaction has not already completed automatically. You do not need to call this method. Rename a default Swift interaction By default, the iOS agent will start an interaction trace when a new view controller is displayed. The interactions are named using the format Display <ViewController>. To change these default names, implement the @objc func customNewRelicInteractionName() -> String method in your view controller, where the string returned becomes the interaction's name. Set a custom application version with Swift The New Relic iOS SDK allows you to set a custom application version string. Instead of using the string defined in CFBundleShortVersionString, call the NewRelic.setApplicationVersion() method, and pass along the custom application version before calling NewRelic.startWithApplicationToken();. NewRelic.setApplicationVersion(String appVersion) Copy Set a custom build identifier with Swift As of version 5.1.0 of the New Relic iOS SDK, an API method allows you to set a custom build identifier that is displayed next to the application version in the Crash details page.

This document contains the iOS SDK instrumentation requirements for: Objective C Swift For details about the available methods for custom attributes and events you can send to to New Relic Insights, see the iOS SDK API reference. You can also configure feature flags for: Objective-C Swift Automatically instrumented classes and methods The following methods (for the listed classes and their sub-classes) are already instrumented by New Relic.

Summary categories include: View loading UI layout Database Images JSON Network Instrument your Objective-C code To have your own Objective-C code appear in interaction code breakdowns and timelines, add a _START call to the beginning of your method and a _STOP call to the end of it. Important Always include a _STOP for each _START, and only include one set of these commands in a given method. The trace system will automatically pick up the class and method name, and report performance metrics for your method to New Relic. - (void)myMethod { NR_TRACE_METHOD_START(0); // … existing code NR_TRACE_METHOD_STOP; } Copy If you are not using ARC, use this version of the _STOP macro to avoid memory leaks: NR_NONARC_TRACE_METHOD_STOP; Copy If you want your method’s performance to be included in the summary data on the APM Overview page, pass one of the NRTraceType enum values into the _START macro; for example: NR_TRACE_METHOD_START(NRTraceTypeDatabase); Copy Create and complete interactions By default, an interaction starts when a view controller is pushed. To manually start an interaction with Objective-C, use these API calls: NSString* uniqueIdentifier = NR_START_NAMED_INTERACTION(@\"name\"); Copy This macro will automatically begin tracking the name interaction trace from the current line. It will also complete any previously running interaction. It returns a unique identifier that can be used to complete that interaction by using this API call: NR_INTERACTION_STOP(uniqueIdentifier); Copy This macro will complete the interaction associated with the uniqueIdentifier if that interaction has not already completed automatically. You do not need to call this method. Rename a default interaction By default, the iOS agent will start an interaction trace when a new view controller is displayed. The interactions are named using the format Display <ViewController>. To change these default names with Objective-C, implement the - (NSString*) customNewRelicInteractionName instance method in your view controller, where the string returned becomes the interaction's name. Set a custom application version The New Relic iOS SDK allows you to set a custom application version string with Objective-C. Instead of using the string defined in CFBundleShortVersionString, call the +[NewRelic setApplicationVersion:] method and pass along the custom application version before calling +[NewRelic startWithApplicationToken:]; [NewRelic setApplicationVersion:(NSString*) appVersion]; Copy Set a custom build identifier As of version 5.1.0 of the New Relic iOS SDK, an API method allows you to set a custom build identifier that is displayed next to the application version in the Crash details page. Instead of using the CFBundleVersion string defined in Xcode with Objective-C, call the +[NewRelic setApplicationBuild:] method, and pass along the custom build identifier. [NewRelic setApplicationBuild:(NSString*) buildNumber]; Copy Create custom metrics Custom metrics can help track high level events specific to your application. With the recordMetric API, you can record arbitrary numerical data and named events with Objective-C and Swift. You can also use several API calls to record custom metrics that provide different levels of detail. Objective-C: Report custom attributes and events Use methods in the NewRelic object to report custom attributes and events. For details about the available methods for custom attributes and events with Objective-C, see the iOS SDK API reference. Methods that return BOOL results return YES if they succeed, or NO if the operation did not complete. These methods are available in versions 5.0.0 or higher of the New Relic iOS SDK. The SDK can store up to 128 user-defined custom attributes at a time. If you attempt to store more than 128 attributes, the SDK returns NO. Custom attributes names should use the simplest format needed, and New Relic recommends single word attributes, containing no spaces. Attribute phrases can be formatted in camel case, so My Custom Attribute is better specified as myCustomAttribute. As with custom metrics: Avoid using the characters / ] [ | * when naming things. Avoid multi-byte characters. Objective-C: Track custom network requests If you can express a transactional network request in terms similar to an HTTP request, you can track it. Use URLs that are well-formed and do not include highly variable paths or hostnames. For requests that complete, use this method: [NewRelic noticeNetworkRequestForURL:(NSURL*)url httpMethod:(NSString*)httpMethod withTimer:(NRTimer *)timer responseHeaders:(NSDictionary *)headers statusCode:(NSInteger)httpStatusCode bytesSent:(NSUInteger)bytesSent bytesReceived:(NSUInteger)bytesReceived responseData:(NSData *)responseData andParams:(NSDictionary *)params]; Copy Parameters include: Parameter Description url The URL of the request httpMethod The method type of the request; for example, POST, GET, etc. timer An NRTimer that timed the network request headers A dictionary containing the HTTP response headers, if available httpStatusCode The response status code If the httpStatusCode is greater than or equal to 400, the agent will record a server error and may capture the responseData body if provided. bytesSent The size of the request body bytesReceived The size of the responseBody responseData The response body data, captured if the agent records server error params params Additional parameters included in an HTTP error metric if the HTTP transaction is an error For requests that fail due to a socket or operating system error, use this method: [NewRelic noticeNetworkFailureForURL:(NSURL *)url httpMethod:(NSString*)httpMethod withTimer:(NRTimer *)timer andFailureCode:(NSInteger)iOSFailureCode]; Copy Parameters include: Parameter Description url The URL of the request httpMethod The method type of the request; for example, POST, GET, etc. timer An NRTimer that timed the network request iOSFailureCode The failure code Failure codes are interpreted as NSURLError* code. To view a complete list of supported codes, see NRConstants.h. Instrument your Swift code To have your own Swift code appear in interaction code breakdowns and timelines: Add a startTracingMethod() call to the beginning of your method. Add a endTracingMethodWithTimer() call to the end of it. Always include an endTracingMethodWithTimer() call for each startTracingMethod() reference. Include only one set of these commands in a given method. func myMethod(){ let timer = NRTimer(); NewRelic.startTracingMethod(#selector(MyClass.myMethod), object: self, timer: timer, category: NRTraceTypeNone) // … existing code NewRelic.endTracingMethodWithTimer(timer) } Copy If you want your method’s performance to be included in the summary data on the APM Overview page, pass one of the NRTraceType enum values into the startTracingMethod() macro; for example: NewRelic.startTracingMethod(#selector(MyClass.myMethod), object: self, timer: timer, category: NRTraceTypeDatabase) Copy Create and complete Swift interactions By default, an interaction starts when a view controller is pushed. To manually start an interaction, use these API calls: let uniqueIdentifier = NewRelic.startInteraction(withName: \"My Interaction\") Copy This call will automatically begin tracking an interaction trace named My Interaction from the current line. It will also complete any previously running interaction. It returns a unique identifier that can be used to complete that interaction by using this API call: NewRelic.stopCurrentInteraction(uniqueIdentifier) Copy This method will complete the interaction associated with the uniqueIdentifier if that interaction has not already completed automatically. You do not need to call this method. Rename a default Swift interaction By default, the iOS agent will start an interaction trace when a new view controller is displayed. The interactions are named using the format Display <ViewController>. To change these default names, implement the @objc func customNewRelicInteractionName() -> String method in your view controller, where the string returned becomes the interaction's name. Set a custom application version with Swift The New Relic iOS SDK allows you to set a custom application version string. Instead of using the string defined in CFBundleShortVersionString, call the NewRelic.setApplicationVersion() method, and pass along the custom application version before calling NewRelic.startWithApplicationToken();. NewRelic.setApplicationVersion(String appVersion) Copy Set a custom build identifier with Swift As of version 5.1.0 of the New Relic iOS SDK, an API method allows you to set a custom build identifier that is displayed next to the application version in the Crash details page.

Compatibility and requirements Before you install the iOS agent, review the compatibility and requirements. Install the agent As part of the installation process, New Relic automatically generates an application token. This is a 40-character hexadecimal string for authenticating each mobile app that you monitor. There are two ways you can install the iOS agent: We recommend you install and configure the iOS agent using the CocoaPods installation method. You can also manually install and configure the iOS agent by adding the New Relic framework to your app. Extend your instrumentation After you install the agent, you can extend the agent's default instrumentation with various types of custom data: To access: In the mobile UI: In New Relic One dashboards: Custom data Create and record custom events, interaction traces, and attributes to add details to your existing data and traces. You can also query the custom events that you created in New Relic One dashboards and NRQL. Network requests Enable the MobileRequest event feature so you can perform a full network analysis. To further investigate network request error rates and response times, query MobileRequest and MobileRequestError events. Crash analysis Review detailed information using groups and filters to analyze trends that lead to crashes. To view more information about crashes, create NRQL queries to review Insights charts related to crash data. iOS SDK API Use the iOS SDK API to instrument parts of your code that are not instrumented by default. Then, view those custom events and attributes in New Relic Insights. Handled exceptions Report exceptions so you can identify factors creating a poor mobile app experience. To further improve performance, review MobileHandledException event records in New Relic Insights. Breadcrumbs Boost the level of detail in crash event trails by adding breadcrumbs.

The interactions are named using the format Display <ViewController>. To change these default names with Objective-C, implement the - (NSString*) customNewRelicInteractionName instance method in your view controller, where the string returned becomes the interaction's name. Set a custom application version The New Relic iOS SDK allows you to set a custom application version string with Objective-C. Instead of using the string defined in CFBundleShortVersionString, call the +[NewRelic setApplicationVersion:] method and pass along the custom application version before calling +[NewRelic startWithApplicationToken:]; [NewRelic setApplicationVersion:(NSString*) appVersion]; Copy Set a custom build identifier As of version 5.1.0 of the New Relic iOS SDK, an API method allows you to set a custom build identifier that is displayed next to the application version in the Crash details page. Instead of using the CFBundleVersion string defined in Xcode with Objective-C, call the +[NewRelic setApplicationBuild:] method, and pass along the custom build identifier. [NewRelic setApplicationBuild:(NSString*) buildNumber]; Copy Create custom metrics Custom metrics can help track high level events specific to your application. With the recordMetric API, you can record arbitrary numerical data and named events with Objective-C and Swift. You can also use several API calls to record custom metrics that provide different levels of detail. Objective-C: Report custom attributes and events Use methods in the NewRelic object to report custom attributes and events. For details about the available methods for custom attributes and events with Objective-C, see the iOS SDK API reference. Methods that return BOOL results return YES if they succeed, or NO if the operation did not complete. These methods are available in versions 5.0.0 or higher of the New Relic iOS SDK. The SDK can store up to 128 user-defined custom attributes at a time. If you attempt to store more than 128 attributes, the SDK returns NO. Custom attributes names should use the simplest format needed, and New Relic recommends single word attributes, containing no spaces. Attribute phrases can be formatted in camel case, so My Custom Attribute is better specified as myCustomAttribute. As with custom metrics: Avoid using the characters / ] [ | * when naming things. Avoid multi-byte characters. Objective-C: Track custom network requests If you can express a transactional network request in terms similar to an HTTP request, you can track it. Use URLs that are well-formed and do not include highly variable paths or hostnames. For requests that complete, use this method: [NewRelic noticeNetworkRequestForURL:(NSURL*)url httpMethod:(NSString*)httpMethod withTimer:(NRTimer *)timer responseHeaders:(NSDictionary *)headers statusCode:(NSInteger)httpStatusCode bytesSent:(NSUInteger)bytesSent bytesReceived:(NSUInteger)bytesReceived responseData:(NSData *)responseData andParams:(NSDictionary *)params]; Copy Parameters include: Parameter Description url The URL of the request httpMethod The method type of the request; for example, POST, GET, etc. timer An NRTimer that timed the network request headers A dictionary containing the HTTP response headers, if available httpStatusCode The response status code If the httpStatusCode is greater than or equal to 400, the agent will record a server error and may capture the responseData body if provided. bytesSent The size of the request body bytesReceived The size of the responseBody responseData The response body data, captured if the agent records server error params params Additional parameters included in an HTTP error metric if the HTTP transaction is an error For requests that fail due to a socket or operating system error, use this method: [NewRelic noticeNetworkFailureForURL:(NSURL *)url httpMethod:(NSString*)httpMethod withTimer:(NRTimer *)timer andFailureCode:(NSInteger)iOSFailureCode]; Copy Parameters include: Parameter Description url The URL of the request httpMethod The method type of the request; for example, POST, GET, etc. timer An NRTimer that timed the network request iOSFailureCode The failure code Failure codes are interpreted as NSURLError* code. To view a complete list of supported codes, see NRConstants.h. Instrument your Swift code To have your own Swift code appear in interaction code breakdowns and timelines: Add a startTracingMethod() call to the beginning of your method. Add a endTracingMethodWithTimer() call to the end of it. Always include an endTracingMethodWithTimer() call for each startTracingMethod() reference. Include only one set of these commands in a given method. func myMethod(){ let timer = NRTimer(); NewRelic.startTracingMethod(#selector(MyClass.myMethod), object: self, timer: timer, category: NRTraceTypeNone) // … existing code NewRelic.endTracingMethodWithTimer(timer) } Copy If you want your method’s performance to be included in the summary data on the APM Overview page, pass one of the NRTraceType enum values into the startTracingMethod() macro; for example: NewRelic.startTracingMethod(#selector(MyClass.myMethod), object: self, timer: timer, category: NRTraceTypeDatabase) Copy Create and complete Swift interactions By default, an interaction starts when a view controller is pushed. To manually start an interaction, use these API calls: let uniqueIdentifier = NewRelic.startInteraction(withName: \"My Interaction\") Copy This call will automatically begin tracking an interaction trace named My Interaction from the current line. It will also complete any previously running interaction. It returns a unique identifier that can be used to complete that interaction by using this API call: NewRelic.stopCurrentInteraction(uniqueIdentifier) Copy This method will complete the interaction associated with the uniqueIdentifier if that interaction has not already completed automatically. You do not need to call this method. Rename a default Swift interaction By default, the iOS agent will start an interaction trace when a new view controller is displayed. The interactions are named using the format Display <ViewController>.

For a general overview of mobile monitoring functionality, see Introduction to mobile monitoring. Compatibility and requirements Before you install the iOS agent, review the compatibility and requirements. Install the agent As part of the installation process, New Relic automatically generates an application token. This is a 40-character hexadecimal string for authenticating each mobile app that you monitor. There are two ways you can install the iOS agent: We recommend you install and configure the iOS agent using the CocoaPods installation method. You can also manually install and configure the iOS agent by adding the New Relic framework to your app. Extend your instrumentation After you install the agent, you can extend the agent's default instrumentation with various types of custom data: To access: In the mobile UI: In New Relic One dashboards: Custom data Create and record custom events, interaction traces, and attributes to add details to your existing data and traces. You can also query the custom events that you created in New Relic One dashboards and NRQL. Network requests Enable the MobileRequest event feature so you can perform a full network analysis. To further investigate network request error rates and response times, query MobileRequest and MobileRequestError events. Crash analysis Review detailed information using groups and filters to analyze trends that lead to crashes. To view more information about crashes, create NRQL queries to review Insights charts related to crash data. iOS SDK API Use the iOS SDK API to instrument parts of your code that are not instrumented by default. Then, view those custom events and attributes in New Relic Insights. Handled exceptions Report exceptions so you can identify factors creating a poor mobile app experience. To further improve performance, review MobileHandledException event records in New Relic Insights. Breadcrumbs Boost the level of detail in crash event trails by adding breadcrumbs. Then, query MobileBreadcrumbs events to see all breadcrumbs or just breadcrumbs related to crashes. Troubleshoot your installation If the agent isn't reporting data, try these troubleshooting suggestions.",

For a general overview of mobile monitoring functionality, see Introduction to mobile monitoring. Compatibility and requirements Before you install the iOS agent, review the compatibility and requirements. Install the agent As part of the installation process, New Relic automatically generates an application token. This is a 40-character hexadecimal string for authenticating each mobile app that you monitor. There are two ways you can install the iOS agent: We recommend you install and configure the iOS agent using the CocoaPods installation method. You can also manually install and configure the iOS agent by adding the New Relic framework to your app. Extend your instrumentation After you install the agent, you can extend the agent's default instrumentation with various types of custom data: To access: In the mobile UI: In New Relic One dashboards: Custom data Create and record custom events, interaction traces, and attributes to add details to your existing data and traces. You can also query the custom events that you created in New Relic One dashboards and NRQL. Network requests Enable the MobileRequest event feature so you can perform a full network analysis. To further investigate network request error rates and response times, query MobileRequest and MobileRequestError events. Crash analysis Review detailed information using groups and filters to analyze trends that lead to crashes. To view more information about crashes, create NRQL queries to review Insights charts related to crash data. iOS SDK API Use the iOS SDK API to instrument parts of your code that are not instrumented by default. Then, view those custom events and attributes in New Relic Insights. Handled exceptions Report exceptions so you can identify factors creating a poor mobile app experience. To further improve performance, review MobileHandledException event records in New Relic Insights. Breadcrumbs Boost the level of detail in crash event trails by adding breadcrumbs. Then, query MobileBreadcrumbs events to see all breadcrumbs or just breadcrumbs related to crashes. Troubleshoot your installation If the agent isn't reporting data, try these troubleshooting suggestions.",

Send custom attributes and events to Insights. Track networking from libraries not supported automatically. Set a custom identifier value with Objective-C or Swift to associate user sessions with analysis events and attributes (iOS SDK version 5.9.0 or higher). Caution Tracing is heavily optimized, but it does impose a performance overhead. Avoid instrumenting methods that are expected to be called hundreds of times. Install the SDK Ensure you have your app instrumented with the latest iOS SDK by going to one.newrelic.com > Add more data and following the instructions for iOS. This document contains the iOS SDK instrumentation requirements for: Objective C Swift For details about the available methods for custom attributes and events you can send to to New Relic Insights, see the iOS SDK API reference. You can also configure feature flags for: Objective-C Swift Automatically instrumented classes and methods The following methods (for the listed classes and their sub-classes) are already instrumented by New Relic. You do not need to add custom instrumentation to trace them. Classes Methods automatically instrumented by New Relic UIViewController viewDidLoad: viewWillAppear: viewDidAppear: viewWillDisappear: viewDidDisappear: viewWillLayoutSubviews: viewDidLayoutSubviews: UIImage imageNamed: imageWithContentsOfFile: imageWithData: imageWithData:scale: initWithContentsOfFile: initWithData: initWithData:scale: NSJSONSerialization JSONObjectWithData:options:error: JSONObjectWithStream:options:error: dataWithJSONObject:options:error: writeJSONObject:toStream:options:error: NSManagedObjectContext executeFetchRequest:error: processPendingChanges The agent aggregates performance for various methods into summary metrics that appear in the Interactions page. Summary categories include: View loading UI layout Database Images JSON Network Instrument your Objective-C code To have your own Objective-C code appear in interaction code breakdowns and timelines, add a _START call to the beginning of your method and a _STOP call to the end of it. Important Always include a _STOP for each _START, and only include one set of these commands in a given method. The trace system will automatically pick up the class and method name, and report performance metrics for your method to New Relic. - (void)myMethod { NR_TRACE_METHOD_START(0); // … existing code NR_TRACE_METHOD_STOP; } Copy If you are not using ARC, use this version of the _STOP macro to avoid memory leaks: NR_NONARC_TRACE_METHOD_STOP; Copy If you want your method’s performance to be included in the summary data on the APM Overview page, pass one of the NRTraceType enum values into the _START macro; for example: NR_TRACE_METHOD_START(NRTraceTypeDatabase); Copy Create and complete interactions By default, an interaction starts when a view controller is pushed. To manually start an interaction with Objective-C, use these API calls: NSString* uniqueIdentifier = NR_START_NAMED_INTERACTION(@\"name\"); Copy This macro will automatically begin tracking the name interaction trace from the current line. It will also complete any previously running interaction. It returns a unique identifier that can be used to complete that interaction by using this API call: NR_INTERACTION_STOP(uniqueIdentifier); Copy This macro will complete the interaction associated with the uniqueIdentifier if that interaction has not already completed automatically. You do not need to call this method. Rename a default interaction By default, the iOS agent will start an interaction trace when a new view controller is displayed. The interactions are named using the format Display <ViewController>. To change these default names with Objective-C, implement the - (NSString*) customNewRelicInteractionName instance method in your view controller, where the string returned becomes the interaction's name. Set a custom application version The New Relic iOS SDK allows you to set a custom application version string with Objective-C. Instead of using the string defined in CFBundleShortVersionString, call the +[NewRelic setApplicationVersion:] method and pass along the custom application version before calling +[NewRelic startWithApplicationToken:]; [NewRelic setApplicationVersion:(NSString*) appVersion]; Copy Set a custom build identifier As of version 5.1.0 of the New Relic iOS SDK, an API method allows you to set a custom build identifier that is displayed next to the application version in the Crash details page. Instead of using the CFBundleVersion string defined in Xcode with Objective-C, call the +[NewRelic setApplicationBuild:] method, and pass along the custom build identifier. [NewRelic setApplicationBuild:(NSString*) buildNumber]; Copy Create custom metrics Custom metrics can help track high level events specific to your application. With the recordMetric API, you can record arbitrary numerical data and named events with Objective-C and Swift. You can also use several API calls to record custom metrics that provide different levels of detail. Objective-C: Report custom attributes and events Use methods in the NewRelic object to report custom attributes and events. For details about the available methods for custom attributes and events with Objective-C, see the iOS SDK API reference. Methods that return BOOL results return YES if they succeed, or NO if the operation did not complete. These methods are available in versions 5.0.0 or higher of the New Relic iOS SDK. The SDK can store up to 128 user-defined custom attributes at a time. If you attempt to store more than 128 attributes, the SDK returns NO. Custom attributes names should use the simplest format needed, and New Relic recommends single word attributes, containing no spaces. Attribute phrases can be formatted in camel case, so My Custom Attribute is better specified as myCustomAttribute. As with custom metrics: Avoid using the characters / ] [ | * when naming things. Avoid multi-byte characters. Objective-C: Track custom network requests If you can express a transactional network request in terms similar to an HTTP request, you can track it. Use URLs that are well-formed and do not include highly variable paths or hostnames. For requests that complete, use this method: [NewRelic noticeNetworkRequestForURL:(NSURL*)url httpMethod:(NSString*)httpMethod withTimer:(NRTimer *)timer responseHeaders:(NSDictionary *)headers statusCode:(NSInteger)httpStatusCode bytesSent:(NSUInteger)bytesSent bytesReceived:(NSUInteger)bytesReceived responseData:(NSData *)responseData andParams:(NSDictionary *)params]; Copy Parameters include: Parameter Description url The URL of the request httpMethod The method type of the request; for example, POST, GET, etc. timer An NRTimer that timed the network request headers A dictionary containing the HTTP response headers, if available httpStatusCode The response status code If the httpStatusCode is greater than or equal to 400, the agent will record a server error and may capture the responseData body if provided. bytesSent The size of the request body bytesReceived The size of the responseBody responseData The response body data, captured if the agent records server error params params Additional parameters included in an HTTP error metric if the HTTP transaction is an error For requests that fail due to a socket or operating system error, use this method: [NewRelic noticeNetworkFailureForURL:(NSURL *)url httpMethod:(NSString*)httpMethod withTimer:(NRTimer *)timer andFailureCode:(NSInteger)iOSFailureCode]; Copy Parameters include: Parameter Description url The URL of the request httpMethod The method type of the request; for example, POST, GET, etc. timer An NRTimer that timed the network request iOSFailureCode The failure code Failure codes are interpreted as NSURLError* code. To view a complete list of supported codes, see NRConstants.h. Instrument your Swift code To have your own Swift code appear in interaction code breakdowns and timelines: Add a startTracingMethod() call to the beginning of your method. Add a endTracingMethodWithTimer() call to the end of it. Always include an endTracingMethodWithTimer() call for each startTracingMethod() reference. Include only one set of these commands in a given method. func myMethod(){ let timer = NRTimer(); NewRelic.startTracingMethod(#selector(MyClass.myMethod), object: self, timer: timer, category: NRTraceTypeNone) // … existing code NewRelic.endTracingMethodWithTimer(timer) } Copy If you want your method’s performance to be included in the summary data on the APM Overview page, pass one of the NRTraceType enum values into the startTracingMethod() macro; for example: NewRelic.startTracingMethod(#selector(MyClass.myMethod), object: self, timer: timer, category: NRTraceTypeDatabase) Copy Create and complete Swift interactions By default, an interaction starts when a view controller is pushed. To manually start an interaction, use these API calls: let uniqueIdentifier = NewRelic.startInteraction(withName: \"My Interaction\") Copy This call will automatically begin tracking an interaction trace named My Interaction from the current line. It will also complete any previously running interaction. It returns a unique identifier that can be used to complete that interaction by using this API call: NewRelic.stopCurrentInteraction(uniqueIdentifier) Copy This method will complete the interaction associated with the uniqueIdentifier if that interaction has not already completed automatically. You do not need to call this method. Rename a default Swift interaction By default, the iOS agent will start an interaction trace when a new view controller is displayed. The interactions are named using the format Display <ViewController>. To change these default names, implement the @objc func customNewRelicInteractionName() -> String method in your view controller, where the string returned becomes the interaction's name. Set a custom application version with Swift The New Relic iOS SDK allows you to set a custom application version string. Instead of using the string defined in CFBundleShortVersionString, call the NewRelic.setApplicationVersion() method, and pass along the custom application version before calling NewRelic.startWithApplicationToken();.

For a general overview of mobile monitoring functionality, see Introduction to mobile monitoring. Compatibility and requirements Before you install the iOS agent, review the compatibility and requirements. Install the agent As part of the installation process, New Relic automatically generates an application token. This is a 40-character hexadecimal string for authenticating each mobile app that you monitor. There are two ways you can install the iOS agent: We recommend you install and configure the iOS agent using the CocoaPods installation method. You can also manually install and configure the iOS agent by adding the New Relic framework to your app. Extend your instrumentation After you install the agent, you can extend the agent's default instrumentation with various types of custom data: To access: In the mobile UI: In New Relic One dashboards: Custom data Create and record custom events, interaction traces, and attributes to add details to your existing data and traces. You can also query the custom events that you created in New Relic One dashboards and NRQL. Network requests Enable the MobileRequest event feature so you can perform a full network analysis. To further investigate network request error rates and response times, query MobileRequest and MobileRequestError events. Crash analysis Review detailed information using groups and filters to analyze trends that lead to crashes. To view more information about crashes, create NRQL queries to review Insights charts related to crash data. iOS SDK API Use the iOS SDK API to instrument parts of your code that are not instrumented by default. Then, view those custom events and attributes in New Relic Insights. Handled exceptions Report exceptions so you can identify factors creating a poor mobile app experience. To further improve performance, review MobileHandledException event records in New Relic Insights. Breadcrumbs Boost the level of detail in crash event trails by adding breadcrumbs. Then, query MobileBreadcrumbs events to see all breadcrumbs or just breadcrumbs related to crashes. Troubleshoot your installation If the agent isn't reporting data, try these troubleshooting suggestions.",

Install the SDK Ensure you have your app instrumented with the latest iOS SDK by going to one.newrelic.com > Add more data and following the instructions for iOS. This document contains the iOS SDK instrumentation requirements for: Objective C Swift For details about the available methods for custom attributes and events you can send to to New Relic Insights, see the iOS SDK API reference. You can also configure feature flags for: Objective-C Swift Automatically instrumented classes and methods The following methods (for the listed classes and their sub-classes) are already instrumented by New Relic. You do not need to add custom instrumentation to trace them. Classes Methods automatically instrumented by New Relic UIViewController viewDidLoad: viewWillAppear: viewDidAppear: viewWillDisappear: viewDidDisappear: viewWillLayoutSubviews: viewDidLayoutSubviews: UIImage imageNamed: imageWithContentsOfFile: imageWithData: imageWithData:scale: initWithContentsOfFile: initWithData: initWithData:scale: NSJSONSerialization JSONObjectWithData:options:error: JSONObjectWithStream:options:error: dataWithJSONObject:options:error: writeJSONObject:toStream:options:error: NSManagedObjectContext executeFetchRequest:error: processPendingChanges The agent aggregates performance for various methods into summary metrics that appear in the Interactions page. Summary categories include: View loading UI layout Database Images JSON Network Instrument your Objective-C code To have your own Objective-C code appear in interaction code breakdowns and timelines, add a _START call to the beginning of your method and a _STOP call to the end of it. Important Always include a _STOP for each _START, and only include one set of these commands in a given method. The trace system will automatically pick up the class and method name, and report performance metrics for your method to New Relic. - (void)myMethod { NR_TRACE_METHOD_START(0); // … existing code NR_TRACE_METHOD_STOP; } Copy If you are not using ARC, use this version of the _STOP macro to avoid memory leaks: NR_NONARC_TRACE_METHOD_STOP; Copy If you want your method’s performance to be included in the summary data on the APM Overview page, pass one of the NRTraceType enum values into the _START macro; for example: NR_TRACE_METHOD_START(NRTraceTypeDatabase); Copy Create and complete interactions By default, an interaction starts when a view controller is pushed. To manually start an interaction with Objective-C, use these API calls: NSString* uniqueIdentifier = NR_START_NAMED_INTERACTION(@\"name\"); Copy This macro will automatically begin tracking the name interaction trace from the current line. It will also complete any previously running interaction. It returns a unique identifier that can be used to complete that interaction by using this API call: NR_INTERACTION_STOP(uniqueIdentifier); Copy This macro will complete the interaction associated with the uniqueIdentifier if that interaction has not already completed automatically. You do not need to call this method. Rename a default interaction By default, the iOS agent will start an interaction trace when a new view controller is displayed. The interactions are named using the format Display <ViewController>. To change these default names with Objective-C, implement the - (NSString*) customNewRelicInteractionName instance method in your view controller, where the string returned becomes the interaction's name. Set a custom application version The New Relic iOS SDK allows you to set a custom application version string with Objective-C. Instead of using the string defined in CFBundleShortVersionString, call the +[NewRelic setApplicationVersion:] method and pass along the custom application version before calling +[NewRelic startWithApplicationToken:]; [NewRelic setApplicationVersion:(NSString*) appVersion]; Copy Set a custom build identifier As of version 5.1.0 of the New Relic iOS SDK, an API method allows you to set a custom build identifier that is displayed next to the application version in the Crash details page. Instead of using the CFBundleVersion string defined in Xcode with Objective-C, call the +[NewRelic setApplicationBuild:] method, and pass along the custom build identifier. [NewRelic setApplicationBuild:(NSString*) buildNumber]; Copy Create custom metrics Custom metrics can help track high level events specific to your application. With the recordMetric API, you can record arbitrary numerical data and named events with Objective-C and Swift. You can also use several API calls to record custom metrics that provide different levels of detail. Objective-C: Report custom attributes and events Use methods in the NewRelic object to report custom attributes and events. For details about the available methods for custom attributes and events with Objective-C, see the iOS SDK API reference. Methods that return BOOL results return YES if they succeed, or NO if the operation did not complete. These methods are available in versions 5.0.0 or higher of the New Relic iOS SDK. The SDK can store up to 128 user-defined custom attributes at a time. If you attempt to store more than 128 attributes, the SDK returns NO. Custom attributes names should use the simplest format needed, and New Relic recommends single word attributes, containing no spaces. Attribute phrases can be formatted in camel case, so My Custom Attribute is better specified as myCustomAttribute. As with custom metrics: Avoid using the characters / ] [ | * when naming things. Avoid multi-byte characters. Objective-C: Track custom network requests If you can express a transactional network request in terms similar to an HTTP request, you can track it. Use URLs that are well-formed and do not include highly variable paths or hostnames. For requests that complete, use this method: [NewRelic noticeNetworkRequestForURL:(NSURL*)url httpMethod:(NSString*)httpMethod withTimer:(NRTimer *)timer responseHeaders:(NSDictionary *)headers statusCode:(NSInteger)httpStatusCode bytesSent:(NSUInteger)bytesSent bytesReceived:(NSUInteger)bytesReceived responseData:(NSData *)responseData andParams:(NSDictionary *)params]; Copy Parameters include: Parameter Description url The URL of the request httpMethod The method type of the request; for example, POST, GET, etc. timer An NRTimer that timed the network request headers A dictionary containing the HTTP response headers, if available httpStatusCode The response status code If the httpStatusCode is greater than or equal to 400, the agent will record a server error and may capture the responseData body if provided. bytesSent The size of the request body bytesReceived The size of the responseBody responseData The response body data, captured if the agent records server error params params Additional parameters included in an HTTP error metric if the HTTP transaction is an error For requests that fail due to a socket or operating system error, use this method: [NewRelic noticeNetworkFailureForURL:(NSURL *)url httpMethod:(NSString*)httpMethod withTimer:(NRTimer *)timer andFailureCode:(NSInteger)iOSFailureCode]; Copy Parameters include: Parameter Description url The URL of the request httpMethod The method type of the request; for example, POST, GET, etc. timer An NRTimer that timed the network request iOSFailureCode The failure code Failure codes are interpreted as NSURLError* code. To view a complete list of supported codes, see NRConstants.h. Instrument your Swift code To have your own Swift code appear in interaction code breakdowns and timelines: Add a startTracingMethod() call to the beginning of your method. Add a endTracingMethodWithTimer() call to the end of it. Always include an endTracingMethodWithTimer() call for each startTracingMethod() reference. Include only one set of these commands in a given method. func myMethod(){ let timer = NRTimer(); NewRelic.startTracingMethod(#selector(MyClass.myMethod), object: self, timer: timer, category: NRTraceTypeNone) // … existing code NewRelic.endTracingMethodWithTimer(timer) } Copy If you want your method’s performance to be included in the summary data on the APM Overview page, pass one of the NRTraceType enum values into the startTracingMethod() macro; for example: NewRelic.startTracingMethod(#selector(MyClass.myMethod), object: self, timer: timer, category: NRTraceTypeDatabase) Copy Create and complete Swift interactions By default, an interaction starts when a view controller is pushed. To manually start an interaction, use these API calls: let uniqueIdentifier = NewRelic.startInteraction(withName: \"My Interaction\") Copy This call will automatically begin tracking an interaction trace named My Interaction from the current line. It will also complete any previously running interaction. It returns a unique identifier that can be used to complete that interaction by using this API call: NewRelic.stopCurrentInteraction(uniqueIdentifier) Copy This method will complete the interaction associated with the uniqueIdentifier if that interaction has not already completed automatically. You do not need to call this method. Rename a default Swift interaction By default, the iOS agent will start an interaction trace when a new view controller is displayed. The interactions are named using the format Display <ViewController>. To change these default names, implement the @objc func customNewRelicInteractionName() -> String method in your view controller, where the string returned becomes the interaction's name. Set a custom application version with Swift The New Relic iOS SDK allows you to set a custom application version string. Instead of using the string defined in CFBundleShortVersionString, call the NewRelic.setApplicationVersion() method, and pass along the custom application version before calling NewRelic.startWithApplicationToken();. NewRelic.setApplicationVersion(String appVersion) Copy Set a custom build identifier with Swift As of version 5.1.0 of the New Relic iOS SDK, an API method allows you to set a custom build identifier that is displayed next to the application version in the Crash details page.

Summary categories include: View loading UI layout Database Images JSON Network Instrument your Objective-C code To have your own Objective-C code appear in interaction code breakdowns and timelines, add a _START call to the beginning of your method and a _STOP call to the end of it. Important Always include a _STOP for each _START, and only include one set of these commands in a given method. The trace system will automatically pick up the class and method name, and report performance metrics for your method to New Relic. - (void)myMethod { NR_TRACE_METHOD_START(0); // … existing code NR_TRACE_METHOD_STOP; } Copy If you are not using ARC, use this version of the _STOP macro to avoid memory leaks: NR_NONARC_TRACE_METHOD_STOP; Copy If you want your method’s performance to be included in the summary data on the APM Overview page, pass one of the NRTraceType enum values into the _START macro; for example: NR_TRACE_METHOD_START(NRTraceTypeDatabase); Copy Create and complete interactions By default, an interaction starts when a view controller is pushed. To manually start an interaction with Objective-C, use these API calls: NSString* uniqueIdentifier = NR_START_NAMED_INTERACTION(@\"name\"); Copy This macro will automatically begin tracking the name interaction trace from the current line. It will also complete any previously running interaction. It returns a unique identifier that can be used to complete that interaction by using this API call: NR_INTERACTION_STOP(uniqueIdentifier); Copy This macro will complete the interaction associated with the uniqueIdentifier if that interaction has not already completed automatically. You do not need to call this method. Rename a default interaction By default, the iOS agent will start an interaction trace when a new view controller is displayed. The interactions are named using the format Display <ViewController>. To change these default names with Objective-C, implement the - (NSString*) customNewRelicInteractionName instance method in your view controller, where the string returned becomes the interaction's name. Set a custom application version The New Relic iOS SDK allows you to set a custom application version string with Objective-C. Instead of using the string defined in CFBundleShortVersionString, call the +[NewRelic setApplicationVersion:] method and pass along the custom application version before calling +[NewRelic startWithApplicationToken:]; [NewRelic setApplicationVersion:(NSString*) appVersion]; Copy Set a custom build identifier As of version 5.1.0 of the New Relic iOS SDK, an API method allows you to set a custom build identifier that is displayed next to the application version in the Crash details page. Instead of using the CFBundleVersion string defined in Xcode with Objective-C, call the +[NewRelic setApplicationBuild:] method, and pass along the custom build identifier. [NewRelic setApplicationBuild:(NSString*) buildNumber]; Copy Create custom metrics Custom metrics can help track high level events specific to your application. With the recordMetric API, you can record arbitrary numerical data and named events with Objective-C and Swift. You can also use several API calls to record custom metrics that provide different levels of detail. Objective-C: Report custom attributes and events Use methods in the NewRelic object to report custom attributes and events. For details about the available methods for custom attributes and events with Objective-C, see the iOS SDK API reference. Methods that return BOOL results return YES if they succeed, or NO if the operation did not complete. These methods are available in versions 5.0.0 or higher of the New Relic iOS SDK. The SDK can store up to 128 user-defined custom attributes at a time. If you attempt to store more than 128 attributes, the SDK returns NO. Custom attributes names should use the simplest format needed, and New Relic recommends single word attributes, containing no spaces. Attribute phrases can be formatted in camel case, so My Custom Attribute is better specified as myCustomAttribute. As with custom metrics: Avoid using the characters / ] [ | * when naming things. Avoid multi-byte characters. Objective-C: Track custom network requests If you can express a transactional network request in terms similar to an HTTP request, you can track it. Use URLs that are well-formed and do not include highly variable paths or hostnames. For requests that complete, use this method: [NewRelic noticeNetworkRequestForURL:(NSURL*)url httpMethod:(NSString*)httpMethod withTimer:(NRTimer *)timer responseHeaders:(NSDictionary *)headers statusCode:(NSInteger)httpStatusCode bytesSent:(NSUInteger)bytesSent bytesReceived:(NSUInteger)bytesReceived responseData:(NSData *)responseData andParams:(NSDictionary *)params]; Copy Parameters include: Parameter Description url The URL of the request httpMethod The method type of the request; for example, POST, GET, etc. timer An NRTimer that timed the network request headers A dictionary containing the HTTP response headers, if available httpStatusCode The response status code If the httpStatusCode is greater than or equal to 400, the agent will record a server error and may capture the responseData body if provided. bytesSent The size of the request body bytesReceived The size of the responseBody responseData The response body data, captured if the agent records server error params params Additional parameters included in an HTTP error metric if the HTTP transaction is an error For requests that fail due to a socket or operating system error, use this method: [NewRelic noticeNetworkFailureForURL:(NSURL *)url httpMethod:(NSString*)httpMethod withTimer:(NRTimer *)timer andFailureCode:(NSInteger)iOSFailureCode]; Copy Parameters include: Parameter Description url The URL of the request httpMethod The method type of the request; for example, POST, GET, etc. timer An NRTimer that timed the network request iOSFailureCode The failure code Failure codes are interpreted as NSURLError* code.

Instrument your Swift code To have your own Swift code appear in interaction code breakdowns and timelines: Add a startTracingMethod() call to the beginning of your method. Add a endTracingMethodWithTimer() call to the end of it. Always include an endTracingMethodWithTimer() call for each startTracingMethod() reference. Include only one set of these commands in a given method. func myMethod(){ let timer = NRTimer(); NewRelic.startTracingMethod(#selector(MyClass.myMethod), object: self, timer: timer, category: NRTraceTypeNone) // … existing code NewRelic.endTracingMethodWithTimer(timer) } Copy If you want your method’s performance to be included in the summary data on the APM Overview page, pass one of the NRTraceType enum values into the startTracingMethod() macro; for example: NewRelic.startTracingMethod(#selector(MyClass.myMethod), object: self, timer: timer, category: NRTraceTypeDatabase) Copy Create and complete Swift interactions By default, an interaction starts when a view controller is pushed. To manually start an interaction, use these API calls: let uniqueIdentifier = NewRelic.startInteraction(withName: \"My Interaction\") Copy This call will automatically begin tracking an interaction trace named My Interaction from the current line. It will also complete any previously running interaction. It returns a unique identifier that can be used to complete that interaction by using this API call: NewRelic.stopCurrentInteraction(uniqueIdentifier) Copy This method will complete the interaction associated with the uniqueIdentifier if that interaction has not already completed automatically.

For a general overview of mobile monitoring functionality, see Introduction to mobile monitoring. Compatibility and requirements Before you install the iOS agent, review the compatibility and requirements. Install the agent As part of the installation process, New Relic automatically generates an application token. This is a 40-character hexadecimal string for authenticating each mobile app that you monitor. There are two ways you can install the iOS agent: We recommend you install and configure the iOS agent using the CocoaPods installation method. You can also manually install and configure the iOS agent by adding the New Relic framework to your app. Extend your instrumentation After you install the agent, you can extend the agent's default instrumentation with various types of custom data: To access: In the mobile UI: In New Relic One dashboards: Custom data Create and record custom events, interaction traces, and attributes to add details to your existing data and traces. You can also query the custom events that you created in New Relic One dashboards and NRQL. Network requests Enable the MobileRequest event feature so you can perform a full network analysis. To further investigate network request error rates and response times, query MobileRequest and MobileRequestError events. Crash analysis Review detailed information using groups and filters to analyze trends that lead to crashes. To view more information about crashes, create NRQL queries to review Insights charts related to crash data. iOS SDK API Use the iOS SDK API to instrument parts of your code that are not instrumented by default. Then, view those custom events and attributes in New Relic Insights. Handled exceptions Report exceptions so you can identify factors creating a poor mobile app experience. To further improve performance, review MobileHandledException event records in New Relic Insights. Breadcrumbs Boost the level of detail in crash event trails by adding breadcrumbs. Then, query MobileBreadcrumbs events to see all breadcrumbs or just breadcrumbs related to crashes. Troubleshoot your installation If the agent isn't reporting data, try these troubleshooting suggestions.",

NewRelic.setApplicationVersion(String appVersion) Copy Set a custom build identifier with Swift As of version 5.1.0 of the New Relic iOS SDK, an API method allows you to set a custom build identifier that is displayed next to the application version in the Crash details page. Instead of using the CFBundleVersion string defined in Xcode, call the NewRelic.setApplicationBuild() method, and pass along the custom build identifier. NewRelic.setApplicationBuild(buildNumber) Copy Create custom metrics with Swift Custom metrics can help track high level events specific to your application. With the recordMetric API, you can record arbitrary numerical data and named events with Objective-C and Swift. You can also use several API calls to record custom metrics that provide different levels of detail. Swift: Report custom attributes and events Use methods in the NewRelic object to report custom attributes and events. For details about the available methods for custom attributes and events with Swift, see the iOS SDK API reference. Methods that return BOOL results return YES if they succeed, or NO if the operation did not complete. These methods are available in versions 5.0.0 or higher of the New Relic iOS SDK. The SDK can store up to 128 user-defined custom attributes at a time. If you attempt to store more than 128 attributes, the SDK returns NO. Custom attributes names should use the simplest format needed, and New Relic recommends single word attributes, containing no spaces. Attribute phrases can be formatted in camel case, so My Custom Attribute is better specified as myCustomAttribute. As with custom metrics: Avoid using the characters / ] [ | * when naming things. Avoid multi-byte characters. Swift: Track custom network requests If you can express a transactional network request in terms similar to an HTTP request, you can track it. Use URLs that are well-formed and do not include highly variable paths or hostnames. For requests that complete, use this method: NewRelic.noticeNetworkRequestForURL(url: NSURL!, httpMethod: String!, withTimer: NRTimer!, responseHeaders:[NSObject : AnyObject]!, statusCode: Int, bytesSent: UInt, bytesReceived: UInt, responseData: NSData!, andParams: [NSObject : AnyObject]!) Copy Parameters include: Parameter Description url The URL of the request httpMethod The method type of the request; for example, POST, GET, etc. timer An NRTimer that timed the network request headers A dictionary containing the HTTP response headers, if available httpStatusCode The response status code If the httpStatusCode is greater than or equal to 400, the agent will record a server error and may capture the responseData body if provided. bytesSent The size of the request body bytesReceived The size of the responseBody responseData The response body data, captured if the agent records Server error params params Additional parameters included in an HTTP error metric if the HTTP transaction is an error For requests that fail due to a socket or operating system error, use this method: NewRelic.noticeNetworkFailureForURL(url: NSURL!, httpMethod: NSString!, withTimer: NRTimer!, andFailureCode: Int) Copy Parameters include: Parameter Description url The URL of the request httpMethod The method type of the request; for example, POST, GET, etc. timer An NRTimer that timed the network request iOSFailureCode The failure code Failure codes are interpreted as NSURLError* code.

For a general overview of mobile monitoring functionality, see Introduction to mobile monitoring. Compatibility and requirements Before you install the iOS agent, review the compatibility and requirements. Install the agent As part of the installation process, New Relic automatically generates an application token. This is a 40-character hexadecimal string for authenticating each mobile app that you monitor. There are two ways you can install the iOS agent: We recommend you install and configure the iOS agent using the CocoaPods installation method. You can also manually install and configure the iOS agent by adding the New Relic framework to your app. Extend your instrumentation After you install the agent, you can extend the agent's default instrumentation with various types of custom data: To access: In the mobile UI: In New Relic One dashboards: Custom data Create and record custom events, interaction traces, and attributes to add details to your existing data and traces. You can also query the custom events that you created in New Relic One dashboards and NRQL. Network requests Enable the MobileRequest event feature so you can perform a full network analysis. To further investigate network request error rates and response times, query MobileRequest and MobileRequestError events. Crash analysis Review detailed information using groups and filters to analyze trends that lead to crashes. To view more information about crashes, create NRQL queries to review Insights charts related to crash data. iOS SDK API Use the iOS SDK API to instrument parts of your code that are not instrumented by default. Then, view those custom events and attributes in New Relic Insights. Handled exceptions Report exceptions so you can identify factors creating a poor mobile app experience. To further improve performance, review MobileHandledException event records in New Relic Insights. Breadcrumbs Boost the level of detail in crash event trails by adding breadcrumbs. Then, query MobileBreadcrumbs events to see all breadcrumbs or just breadcrumbs related to crashes. Troubleshoot your installation If the agent isn't reporting data, try these troubleshooting suggestions.",

Summary categories include: View loading UI layout Database Images JSON Network Instrument your Objective-C code To have your own Objective-C code appear in interaction code breakdowns and timelines, add a _START call to the beginning of your method and a _STOP call to the end of it. Important Always include a _STOP for each _START, and only include one set of these commands in a given method. The trace system will automatically pick up the class and method name, and report performance metrics for your method to New Relic. - (void)myMethod { NR_TRACE_METHOD_START(0); // … existing code NR_TRACE_METHOD_STOP; } Copy If you are not using ARC, use this version of the _STOP macro to avoid memory leaks: NR_NONARC_TRACE_METHOD_STOP; Copy If you want your method’s performance to be included in the summary data on the APM Overview page, pass one of the NRTraceType enum values into the _START macro; for example: NR_TRACE_METHOD_START(NRTraceTypeDatabase); Copy Create and complete interactions By default, an interaction starts when a view controller is pushed. To manually start an interaction with Objective-C, use these API calls: NSString* uniqueIdentifier = NR_START_NAMED_INTERACTION(@\"name\"); Copy This macro will automatically begin tracking the name interaction trace from the current line. It will also complete any previously running interaction. It returns a unique identifier that can be used to complete that interaction by using this API call: NR_INTERACTION_STOP(uniqueIdentifier); Copy This macro will complete the interaction associated with the uniqueIdentifier if that interaction has not already completed automatically. You do not need to call this method. Rename a default interaction By default, the iOS agent will start an interaction trace when a new view controller is displayed. The interactions are named using the format Display <ViewController>. To change these default names with Objective-C, implement the - (NSString*) customNewRelicInteractionName instance method in your view controller, where the string returned becomes the interaction's name. Set a custom application version The New Relic iOS SDK allows you to set a custom application version string with Objective-C. Instead of using the string defined in CFBundleShortVersionString, call the +[NewRelic setApplicationVersion:] method and pass along the custom application version before calling +[NewRelic startWithApplicationToken:]; [NewRelic setApplicationVersion:(NSString*) appVersion]; Copy Set a custom build identifier As of version 5.1.0 of the New Relic iOS SDK, an API method allows you to set a custom build identifier that is displayed next to the application version in the Crash details page.

The SDK can store up to 128 user-defined custom attributes at a time. If you attempt to store more than 128 attributes, the SDK returns NO. Custom attributes names should use the simplest format needed, and New Relic recommends single word attributes, containing no spaces. Attribute phrases can be formatted in camel case, so My Custom Attribute is better specified as myCustomAttribute. As with custom metrics: Avoid using the characters / ] [ | * when naming things. Avoid multi-byte characters. Objective-C: Track custom network requests If you can express a transactional network request in terms similar to an HTTP request, you can track it. Use URLs that are well-formed and do not include highly variable paths or hostnames.

To view a complete list of supported codes, see NRConstants.h. Instrument your Swift code To have your own Swift code appear in interaction code breakdowns and timelines: Add a startTracingMethod() call to the beginning of your method. Add a endTracingMethodWithTimer() call to the end of it. Always include an endTracingMethodWithTimer() call for each startTracingMethod() reference. Include only one set of these commands in a given method. func myMethod(){ let timer = NRTimer(); NewRelic.startTracingMethod(#selector(MyClass.myMethod), object: self, timer: timer, category: NRTraceTypeNone) // … existing code NewRelic.endTracingMethodWithTimer(timer) } Copy If you want your method’s performance to be included in the summary data on the APM Overview page, pass one of the NRTraceType enum values into the startTracingMethod() macro; for example: NewRelic.startTracingMethod(#selector(MyClass.myMethod), object: self, timer: timer, category: NRTraceTypeDatabase) Copy Create and complete Swift interactions By default, an interaction starts when a view controller is pushed. To manually start an interaction, use these API calls: let uniqueIdentifier = NewRelic.startInteraction(withName: \"My Interaction\") Copy This call will automatically begin tracking an interaction trace named My Interaction from the current line. It will also complete any previously running interaction. It returns a unique identifier that can be used to complete that interaction by using this API call: NewRelic.stopCurrentInteraction(uniqueIdentifier) Copy This method will complete the interaction associated with the uniqueIdentifier if that interaction has not already completed automatically.

Install the agent As part of the installation process, New Relic automatically generates an application token. This is a 40-character hexadecimal string for authenticating each mobile app that you monitor. There are two ways you can install the iOS agent: We recommend you install and configure the iOS agent using the CocoaPods installation method. You can also manually install and configure the iOS agent by adding the New Relic framework to your app. Extend your instrumentation After you install the agent, you can extend the agent's default instrumentation with various types of custom data: To access: In the mobile UI: In New Relic One dashboards: Custom data Create and record custom events, interaction traces, and attributes to add details to your existing data and traces. You can also query the custom events that you created in New Relic One dashboards and NRQL. Network requests Enable the MobileRequest event feature so you can perform a full network analysis. To further investigate network request error rates and response times, query MobileRequest and MobileRequestError events. Crash analysis Review detailed information using groups and filters to analyze trends that lead to crashes. To view more information about crashes, create NRQL queries to review Insights charts related to crash data. iOS SDK API Use the iOS SDK API to instrument parts of your code that are not instrumented by default. Then, view those custom events and attributes in New Relic Insights. Handled exceptions Report exceptions so you can identify factors creating a poor mobile app experience. To further improve performance, review MobileHandledException event records in New Relic Insights. Breadcrumbs Boost the level of detail in crash event trails by adding breadcrumbs. Then, query MobileBreadcrumbs events to see all breadcrumbs or just breadcrumbs related to crashes.

      "body": "NerdGraph is our GraphQL-format API that lets you query New Relic data and configure some New Relic features. After you sign up for a free New Relic account and install any of our monitoring services, you can get started with NerdGraph. What is NerdGraph? New Relic has several APIs. NerdGraph is the API we recommend for querying New Relic data and for performing some specific configurations (learn more about features). NerdGraph provides a single API interface for returning data from New Relic’s various APIs and microservices. Over time, other configuration capabilities will be added to NerdGraph. Important NerdGraph isn’t used for data ingest. For that, you'd use our data ingest APIs. NerdGraph is built using GraphQL, which is an open source API format that allows you to request exactly the data needed, with no over-fetching or under-fetching. For a lesson in how to use NerdGraph, watch this 7-minute video: Want to watch more video tutorials? Go to the New Relic University’s Intro to NerdGraph. Or see the online course on New Relic APIs. Use the GraphiQL explorer To get started using GraphQL, we recommend playing around with our GraphiQL explorer (GraphiQL is an open source graphical interface for using GraphQL). You can use it to explore our data schema, to read built-in object definitions, and to build and execute queries. To use GraphQL, you’ll need a user-specific New Relic API key called a user key. You can generate one or find an existing one from the GraphiQL explorer’s API key dropdown. To find the GraphiQL explorer: If your New Relic account uses an EU data center, go to api.eu.newrelic.com/graphiql. Otherwise use api.newrelic.com/graphiql. For tips on how to build queries, see Build queries. Requirements and endpoints To use NerdGraph, you need a New Relic user key, which can be generated and accessed from the GraphiQL explorer. The endpoints are: Main endpoint: https://api.newrelic.com/graphql Endpoint for accounts using EU data center: https://api.eu.newrelic.com/graphql To access the endpoint, use the following cURL command: curl -X POST https://api.newrelic.com/graphql \\ -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \\ -H 'API-Key: YOUR_NEW_RELIC_USER_KEY' \\ -d '{ \"query\": \"{ requestContext { userId apiKey } }\" } ' Copy What can you do with NerdGraph? NerdGraph functionality can be broken down into two main categories: Querying New Relic data. You can fetch data for a variety of purposes, including using it in a programmatic workflow, or building a New Relic One app for custom data visualizations. Configuring New Relic features. There are a variety of configurations available and more will be added over time. You can do things like add tags, configure workloads, or customize \"golden metrics.\" You can use NerdGraph to return a wide range of New Relic data but we’ve created some tutorials for common use cases: Topic Tutorials Your monitored entities Get data about entities Understand entity relationships and dependencies (used to build service maps) Query and configure \"golden metrics\" (important entity metrics) Querying data Query using NRQL (our query language) Tags Add and manage tags Dashboards Create dashboards Export dashboards to other accounts Export dashboards as files Migrate from Insights Dashboard API to NerdGraph Alerts See all alert-related tutorials Applied Intelligence View and configure topology Workloads View and configure workloads Service Levels Configure and manage Service Levels Manage keys Create and manage keys (license keys used for data ingest, and user keys) Manage data Convert event data to metric data Drop data Distributed tracing Query distributed tracing data Configure Infinite Tracing New Relic One apps Build a New Relic One app Cloud integrations (AWS, Azure, GCP) Configure cloud integrations Partners and resellers Manage subscriptions (only for partners using original pricing model) Data partitions Manage data partitions Date retention Manage data retention NerdGraph terminology The following are terms that originate with GraphQL (the API format NerdGraph uses). Term Definition Queries and mutations There are two classes of GraphQL operations: Queries are basic requests used only to fetch data. These queries are not static, meaning that you can ask for more data or less data, depending on your needs. For each query, you can specify exactly what data you want to retrieve, as long as it is supported by the schema. Mutations are requests that perform an action, such as creating a resource or changing configuration. Mutations require the keyword mutation, as well as the name of the mutation. Type Data in GraphQL is organized into types. Types can be scalars (like strings, numbers, or booleans) or object types. An object type is a custom type made up of a collection of fields. For example, an object type called User may represent a user in a system. Field A field represents a piece of information on an object type that can be queried. Fields can be scalars, lists, or objects. For example, a User object type could have a string field called name. Interface An interface is an abstract type that represents a collection of common fields that other object types can implement. Tips on using the GraphiQL explorer You can make queries with the NerdGraph GraphiQL explorer. The explorer provides built-in schema definitions and features, including auto-complete and query validation. Query accounts a New Relic user can access You can query for the name of an account that an actor (a New Relic authorized user) has access to: query { actor { account(id: YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID) { name } } } Copy The response will mirror the query structure you defined in the request, making it easy to ask for the specific data that you want. { \"data\": { \"actor\": { \"account\": { \"name\": \"Data Nerd\" } } } } Copy Query user, account, and NRQL in one request The graph structure shows its capabilities when queries become more complex. For example, you can query for user information, account information, and make a NRQL query with one request. With REST API, this would take three different requests to three different endpoints. query { actor { account(id: YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID) { name nrql(query: \"SELECT * FROM Transaction\") { results } } user { name id } } } Copy",

      "body": "If you’ve been reading our documentation, chances are you’ve already learned a bit about New Relic and the many tools and capabilities we offer. We’re very proud of the utility and design of our dashboards, alerts, and versatile programmability, but none of it would be possible without the computing power needed to make it all run smoothly. Just like a finely calibrated race car, what you see on the outside may be the most exciting features, and these are the parts you interact with to “drive.” But without an engine designed to win, elegant instrument panels, a responsive clutch, and a great paint job won’t get you anywhere. Under the hood of New Relic lies the engine powering it all: the New Relic Database (NRDB). In this resource, we explain how NRDB helps you succeed in your observability goals. Billions of data points per minute New Relic ingests billions of telemetry data points every minute, serving more than 180,000 accounts simultaneously. To run such a high-volume platform, the underlying database and query capabilities need to be fast, flexible, and scalable. They must also be equally effective for organizations of all sizes, supporting a wide spectrum of telemetry needs and business goals. NRDB provides the power, speed, and scalability you need to monitor your performance across your entire landscape quickly and effectively. Scale, purpose, and equal access to resources To meet the challenging demands for speed, efficiency, scalability, and reliability, we built NRDB with three key objectives. Unlimited scalability: Hosted in the cloud, NRDB's distributed architecture has the capacity for virtually unlimited scale. Monitoring and analysis: With this dual purpose in mind, NRDB handles operational monitoring and data analytics equally well. This means that NRDB can ingest massive amounts of data while also giving you real-time alerting, lightning-fast queries, and charting — all without sacrificing speed. Resources when you need them: As a multi-tenant system supporting tens of thousands of customers, NRDB gives you the resources you need when you need them (which single-tenant systems cannot match). The lifecycle of a query NRDB returns results for queries of all sizes astonishingly fast. To do this, we use parallel processing at massive scale. This architectural approach is equally effective for accelerating a single large query and for allowing numerous users to run small queries simultaneously without impacting speed. It works like this: A user enters a query using one of our tools, such as the query builder, or a dashboard or other type of instrumentation sends an automated query. NRDB starts by sending the query to a router, which in turn sends the query components to hundreds or even thousands of query workers. The query workers find the data, and the process is repeated in reverse, with data returning to populate dashboards, create alerts, or answer discrete queries, among other things. This process yields complete query results in a fraction of the time that other methods would require. To further improve efficiency, NRDB also caches recent queries, allowing it to send those results back to users nearly instantaneously. The result: flexibility, speed, accuracy, and efficiency How big is the difference? Because of NDRB's raw power and purposeful design, New Relic's telemetry products are able to analyze tens of billions of events per second while maintaining a median query response time of 45 milliseconds. We would say, “Your query results are just a heartbeat away,” but mathematically that’s more like a tenth of a heartbeat (unless you’re a mouse). What do these statistics mean for our customers? At the end of the day, NRDB's speed and unique capabilities enable you to identify, analyze, and fix performance problems much faster, reducing downtime so you can get back to business. What’s next? Now it's time to get data into New Relic! New Relic-built agents and integrations There are many ways to get data into your New Relic account. Any New Relic user can use any of our data ingest methods to report data to our platform.When you enable New Relic solutions like APM, browser monitoring, mobile monitoring, infrastructure monitoring, or any of our wide array of quickstarts, by default you'll receive data from your monitored applications, hosts, services, or other entities. Some options for getting started: Log into one.newrelic.com and click Add more data to get some guidance on setting up New Relic solutions. (Need to create a New Relic account first? Sign up for free!) To browse our solutions, see New Relic Instant Observability. Report custom data If you need to report data that our agents and integrations don't provide, we have tools that will allow you to bring in any type of data you need. To learn more, see Intro to custom data. Learn more Want to know more? Here are a few recommendations for what to do next: Learn about NRDB's data model and flexible schema in our blog post and white paper.

Use existing Grafana dashboards with New Relic When you integrate Prometheus metrics with New Relic via Remote Write or the OpenMetrics Integration (2.0+) and configure New Relic as a Prometheus data source in Grafana, you can use existing Grafana dashboards and seamlessly tap into the additional monitoring, reliability, and scale we provide. Compatibility and requirements Before you begin, make sure you’ve finished integrating Prometheus metrics and are running a recent enough version of Grafana. You should have either the Remote Write or the OpenMetrics Integration ( v2.0+) set up before you can configure New Relic Prometheus data sources in Grafana. You can only configure New Relic Prometheus data sources using this method in Grafana versions 6.7.0 or newer. You will need to configure custom headers in the UI, and this isn’t possible with earlier versions. For details, see Configure New Relic as a Prometheus data source for Grafana. Support for PromQL Our Prometheus API emulates Prometheus' query APIs. We support the Prometheus query language (PromQL) through our PromQL-style query mode. We do our best to automatically translate PromQL syntax queries into the closest NRQL approximation. For more information on how this works and differences you may observe between Prometheus and New Relic, see Supported PromQL features. Get data flowing in Grafana To make your New Relic data available in Grafana, you can configure a new or existing Prometheus data source in just a couple of simple steps: In the Grafana UI, add and configure a new data source.

      "body": "Troubleshooting OpenTelemetry with New Relic may just be a matter of making sure you are following best practices, but sometimes you may need to take additional steps to diagnose your issues. Here are some examples of specific problems you might encounter, along with steps and tools to resolve them. OpenTelemetry data sent via OTLP is not queryable Problem You sent OpenTelemetry metrics, logs, or traces using OTLP and are unable to view the data. Before digging deeper, make sure you've checked the following: The OTLP endpoint configured matches one of our documented endpoints, is properly formatted, and includes the official default port, 4317. Sending OTLP data via port 443 is not supported at this time. Please note the specific endpoint for FedRAMP compliance, if applicable. The outbound traffic is not restricted by a firewall. Our Networks document explains domains and network blocks that you may need to explicitly allow. The client is configured to use TLS 1.2 or higher and the request includes the api-key header with a valid New Relic account (ingest) license key. Requests include valid protobuf payloads and use gRPC and HTTP/2 transport, preferably with gzip compression enabled. Sending protobuf or JSON-encoded payloads over HTTP/1.1 is not supported at this time. Client output and logs do not indicate 4xx or 5xx response codes are being returned. Solution There are number of tools you can use to validate the successful delivery of telemetry data to our platform. A good first step is to check the data management hub to facet data ingest and determine how much data is arriving from various sources. You can also use the data explorer or query builder to look for data faceted by instrumentation.provider or newrelic.source attributes: FROM Log, Metric, Span SELECT datapointcount() WHERE instrumentation.provider = 'opentelemetry' FACET instrumentation.provider, newrelic.source Copy This query should tell you whether data is arriving via OTLP. If the data you expect is not present, try removing the WHERE clause or checking for integration errors. Querying NrIntegrationError events can help you determine whether you have configuration or format issues or if you've run into our platform limits. Important The ingest limits for metrics, logs, and traces via OTLP are the same as our other data ingest API limits. Various parts of the New Relic UI rely on the presence of specific attributes to function properly. You can use the NRQL console feature in many places to check the WHERE or FACET clauses of the query for required attributes. You can also edit those clauses and re-run the query to determine whether there is data present with those attributes missing. Examples of required attributes include service.name and service.instance.id. For a more complete list of examples, see resources. OpenTelemetry entities or relationships are missing Problem You sent OpenTelemetry data from a service or infrastructure component and either the entity or its relationships are missing or incorrect. Solution OpenTelemetry entities will be synthesized based on the public rules described for the EXT-SERVICE entity type. The standard rule to match relies on the presence of the service.name dimension which follows the OpenTelemetry semantic conventions. To set the service.name with the OpenTelemetry Java SDK, include it in your resource: var resource = Resource.getDefault() .merge(Resource.builder().put(SERVICE_NAME, serviceName).build()); Copy Depending on the SDK, you may also set the service.name by declaring it in the OTEL_RESOURCE_ATTRIBUTES or OTEL_SERVICE_NAME environment variables. For Logs, you can use a structured log template to inject the service.name. Here are some log examples: Setting the service name Logs in context with Log4j2 Tip For more OpenTelemetry examples with New Relic, visit the newrelic-opentelemetry-examples repository on GitHub.",

Here's an overview of the process, followed by details for each step. Prerequisites Instrument your service with OpenTelemetry Export your telemetry data to New Relic View your data in the New Relic UI Step 1. Prerequisites First things first: If we don’t already know you, sign up for a free New Relic account. Copy your account license key. Step 2. Instrument your service with OpenTelemetry To get started, you instrument your service with OpenTelemetry. OpenTelemetry has language-specific products and SDKs to help you. Many languages offer out-the-box instrumentation for common libraries and frameworks. Each language also provides an API for further instrumenting your service manually. Go to the repository for your language and follow the instructions to instrument your service. When you're done, return here to complete Step 3. Export your telemetry data to New Relic. C++ Erlang Go Java Javascript/Node.js .NET PHP Python Ruby Rust Swift ...See a complete list of languages in GitHub Step 3. Export your telemetry data to New Relic The OpenTelemetry Protocol, or OTLP for short, is a general purpose telemetry data delivery protocol designed for the OpenTelemetry project. This protocol describes how to encode and transmit telemetry data, which makes it a natural choice for data transport. Each language SDK provides an OTLP exporter you can configure to export data over OTLP. In this step, we focus on how to configure an OTLP exporter in your service to export data directly to New Relic. If you prefer to export your data first to an OpenTelemetry collector, we have separate instructions. Here's an example of sending data from your service directly to New Relic. To complete this third step, first familiarize yourself with some required New Relic settings, and then complete the steps in the OTLP exporter documentation for your language. Review New Relic settings for exports Before you go to the external OTLP exporter documentation, consult the table below so you're ready to do the following: Configure the OTLP exporter to add a header (api-key) whose value is the license key for the New Relic account you want to send data to. Based on your region, configure the endpoint where the exporter sends data to New Relic. Region gRPC HTTP/1.1 Endpoint API header name API header value TLS encryption required US ✅ ❌ https://otlp.nr-data.net:4317 api-key License key ✅ EU ✅ ❌ https://otlp.eu01.nr-data.net:4317 api-key License key ✅ Important If you have FedRamp compliance constraints, you will need to use https://gov-otlp.nr-data.net:4317. Please see FedRAMP-compliant endpoints for further information. Important In Node.js, the opentelemetry-collector-grpc library requires additional options to enable TLS. Complete the export configuration steps Click on the link below for your language and complete the configuration steps. When you're done, return here to complete Step 4. View your data in the New Relic UI. C++ Erlang Go Java Javascript/Node.js .NET PHP Python Ruby Rust Swift ...Find additional OTLP language support in GitHub Export data to an OpenTelemetry Collector (optional) The OpenTelemetry Collector is a configurable and extensible software component to receive, process, and export telemetry data. When you set up a collector, it can operate as a gateway or as an agent: Gateway: The collector receives data from a variety of sources and applies standard processing before exporting to some backend. Agent: The collector is deployed on each host in an environment and can collect telemetry data about the host and processes running on it. When you use a collector, you start by following the same routine as above for setting up OTLP in your service. In this case, instead of exporting data directly to New Relic, you export through a collector that you set up. In the collector, you configure the OTLP exporter to export data to New Relic. When your data goes through a collector, the transport looks like this: Here's a Docker example of how to set up and run an OpenTelemetry collector with the collector YAML: Save the following as otel-config.yaml: receivers: otlp: protocols: grpc: http: processors: batch: exporters: otlp: endpoint: ${OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_ENDPOINT} headers: api-key: ${NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY} service: pipelines: traces: receivers: [otlp] processors: [batch] exporters: [otlp] metrics: receivers: [otlp] processors: [batch] exporters: [otlp] logs: receivers: [otlp] processors: [batch] exporters: [otlp] Copy Run the OpenTelemetry collector, making sure you replace OTLP_ENDPOINT_HERE with the appropriate endpoint and replace YOUR_KEY_HERE with your account's license key: export OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_ENDPOINT=OTLP_ENDPOINT_HERE export NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY=YOUR_KEY_HERE docker run --rm \\ -e OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_ENDPOINT \\ -e NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY \\ -p 4317:4317 \\ -v \"${PWD}/otel-config.yaml\":/otel-config.yaml \\ --config otel-config.yaml \\ --name otelcol \\ otel/opentelemetry-collector Copy Step 4. View your data in the New Relic UI Once you’ve instrumented your service and configured it to export its data to New Relic, watch the New Relic One user interface for your traces, metrics, and logs! The UI for OpenTelemetry has some similarities to the APM agent UI, so if you are familiar with that, you can go right to the UI.

OpenTelemetry data sent via OTLP is not queryable Problem You sent OpenTelemetry metrics, logs, or traces using OTLP and are unable to view the data. Before digging deeper, make sure you've checked the following: The OTLP endpoint configured matches one of our documented endpoints, is properly formatted, and includes the official default port, 4317. Sending OTLP data via port 443 is not supported at this time. Please note the specific endpoint for FedRAMP compliance, if applicable. The outbound traffic is not restricted by a firewall. Our Networks document explains domains and network blocks that you may need to explicitly allow.

Sending protobuf or JSON-encoded payloads over HTTP/1.1 is not supported at this time. Client output and logs do not indicate 4xx or 5xx response codes are being returned. Solution There are number of tools you can use to validate the successful delivery of telemetry data to our platform. A good first step is to check the data management hub to facet data ingest and determine how much data is arriving from various sources. You can also use the data explorer or query builder to look for data faceted by instrumentation.provider or newrelic.source attributes: FROM Log, Metric, Span SELECT datapointcount() WHERE instrumentation.provider = 'opentelemetry' FACET instrumentation.provider, newrelic.source Copy This query should tell you whether data is arriving via OTLP. If the data you expect is not present, try removing the WHERE clause or checking for integration errors. Querying NrIntegrationError events can help you determine whether you have configuration or format issues or if you've run into our platform limits. Important The ingest limits for metrics, logs, and traces via OTLP are the same as our other data ingest API limits. Various parts of the New Relic UI rely on the presence of specific attributes to function properly. You can use the NRQL console feature in many places to check the WHERE or FACET clauses of the query for required attributes. You can also edit those clauses and re-run the query to determine whether there is data present with those attributes missing. Examples of required attributes include service.name and service.instance.id. For a more complete list of examples, see resources. OpenTelemetry entities or relationships are missing Problem You sent OpenTelemetry data from a service or infrastructure component and either the entity or its relationships are missing or incorrect. Solution OpenTelemetry entities will be synthesized based on the public rules described for the EXT-SERVICE entity type. The standard rule to match relies on the presence of the service.name dimension which follows the OpenTelemetry semantic conventions. To set the service.name with the OpenTelemetry Java SDK, include it in your resource: var resource = Resource.getDefault() .merge(Resource.builder().put(SERVICE_NAME, serviceName).build()); Copy Depending on the SDK, you may also set the service.name by declaring it in the OTEL_RESOURCE_ATTRIBUTES or OTEL_SERVICE_NAME environment variables. For Logs, you can use a structured log template to inject the service.name.

      "body": "Here are some best practices based on how OpenTelemetry works with New Relic: Resources Batching Compression Traces Metrics Logs Tip For information about resolving specific issues, see our troubleshooting guide. Resources A resource in OpenTelemetry represents information about an entity generating telemetry data. All telemetry data sent to New Relic is expected to be associated with a resource so that it can be linked with the appropriate entity in New Relic. The OpenTelemetry Resource SDK specification defines the functionality implemented by all language SDKs for defining a resource. The following suites of attributes are defined by the OpenTelemetry resource semantic conventions. These attributes are usually set by creating a resource using the OpenTelemetry SDK. service.* attributes service.name attribute is required to associate your resource with an entity in the UI service.instance.id is required for certain panes to light up telemetry.sdk.language=java is required to see data in the JVM section Batching Caution Avoid getting rate limited! You should batch requests sent to the OTLP endpoint as described in this section. By default, the OpenTelemetry SDKs and Collector send one (1) data point per request. Using these defaults, it is likely your account will be rate limited. All OpenTelemetry SDKs and Collectors provide a BatchProcessor, which batches data points in memory. This batching allows requests to be sent with more than one (1) data point. Component Batch Processor Collector Batch Processor Go SDK BatchSpanProcessor JS SDK BatchSpanProcessor Python SDK BatchExportSpanProcessor Compression New Relic supports gzip compression for OTLP payloads exported over gRPC. To maximize the amount of data you can send per request, we recommend enabling compression in all OTLP exporters. If there are other compression formats you'd like to see us support, please let us know in the CNCF Slack channel. Traces Familiarize yourself with these trace topics to ensure your traces and spans appear in New Relic. Required fields The startTimeUnixNano and endTimeUnixNano fields on spans are required according to the OpenTelemetry protocol for trace data. When startTimeUnixNano is not present, the span is dropped and a NrIntegrationError is created. When endTimeUnixNano is not present, the duration of your span is large and negative. The timeUnixNano field on span events is required. When timeUnixNano is not present, the span event is dropped and a NrIntegrationError is created. The traceId and spanId fields on spans are required according to the OpenTelemetry protocol for trace data. When traceId or spanId are not present, the span is dropped and a NrIntegrationError is created. Sampling Trace data is the most mature OpenTelemetry data type. Because of this, New Relic's OpenTelemetry user experience is largely based on trace data and is therefore influenced by your sampling strategy. You can configure sampling in a number of places: Service: Use the OpenTelemetry SDK for your language. Collector: If you're running your own instance of the OpenTelemetry collector, you can configure it to do more sophisticated forms of sampling, such as tail-based sampling (see below). Check out this documentation about how to configure different types of sampling: OpenTelemetry built-in samplers Built-in samplers implemented by the OpenTelemetry SDK for each language. OpenTelemetry tail-based samplers The OpenTelemetry collector has a tail-based sampling processor. We have an example demonstrating the use of the tail-based sampling processor. New Relic tail-based sampling with Infinite Tracing Infinite Tracing is New Relic's tail-based sampling option. You can use this in conjunction with your OpenTelemetry instrumented services. In setting up Infinite Tracing, you need to override the default span endpoint and send telemetry data to the New Relic trace observer: Important Currently, Infinite Tracing does not support OTLP ingest. You must run your own instance of the OpenTelemetry Collector and configure it to use the New Relic exporter. Follow the steps in Set up the trace observer to get the value for YOUR_TRACE_OBSERVER_URL. Use the value of YOUR_TRACE_OBSERVER_URL to configure your integration. Since you want New Relic to analyze all your traces, make sure to verify that your OpenTelemetry integrations use the AlwaysOn sampler. Metrics OpenTelemetry metrics are largely compatible with New Relic dimensional metrics. We support OpenTelemetry metrics v0.10. All of the supported metric types include an independent set of associated attributes (name-value pairs) which map directly to dimensions you can use to facet or filter metric data at query time. OpenTelemetry metrics are accompanied by a set of resource attributes that identify the originating entity that produced them and map to dimensions for faceting and filtering. The OpenTelemetry data model for metrics defines a number of different metric types: sum, gauge, histogram, and summary. Sum metrics OpenTelemetry sums are a scalar metric that is the sum of all data points over a given time window. Sums have a notion of temporality indicating whether reported values incorporate previous measurements (cumulative temporality) or not (delta temporality). In addition, sums can either be monotonic (only go up or only go down) or non-monotonic (go up and down). Delta sums In New Relic, delta metrics are handled differently depending on whether they are monotonic or non-monotonic: Monotonic delta sums are mapped to the count metric type. Non-monotonic delta sums are mapped to the gauge metric type. Cumulative sums Monotonic and non-monotonic cumulative sums are mapped to the New Relic gauge metric type. Sum configuration examples To understand how to configure aggregation temporality, see these examples using the Java and Go OpenTelemetry SDKs. Gauge metrics OpenTelemetry gauge metric data points represent a sampled value at a given time. These values are converted to the New Relic gauge metric type. OpenTelemetry gauges do not have an aggregation temporality, but the sampled values can be aggregated at query time. Histogram metrics OpenTelemetry histograms compactly represent a population of recorded values along with a total count and sum. Optionally, histograms may include a series of buckets with explicit bounds and a count value for that bucket’s population. OpenTelemetry histograms are converted to New Relic’s distribution metric type, which is backed by a scaled exponential base 2 histogram (see NrSketch for a more thorough explanation). Counts from OpenTelemetry histogram buckets are assigned to New Relic’s distribution metric buckets using linear interpolation. Also, OpenTelemetry has negative and positive infinity bound buckets which we represent in New Relic as zero-width buckets. We do this because we do not have a representation for negative and positive infinity. For example, an OpenTelemetry bucket with bounds [-∞, 10) will be represented by a [10,10) zero width New Relic bucket. You may see exaggerated bucket counts at the endpoints of your distribution due to this translation. Summary metrics OpenTelemetry summary metric data points are used to represent quantile summaries (for example, P99 latency). These map directly to the New Relic summary metric type. Summary metric data points include count, sum, and quantile values, with 0.0 as min and 1.0 as max. OpenTelemetry provides summary metrics for compatibility with other formats. Start time The startTimeUnixNano field is optional according to the OpenTelemetry specification. When this field is provided, it is used for the timestamp on the resulting NewRelic metric, and the duration is calculated as timeUnixNano - startTimeUnixNano. The duration field is used to calculate the queryable endTimeStamp attribute on the New Relic metric, but it serves no other semantic purpose. If startTimeUnixNano is not provided, then timeUnixNano is used for the timestamp field on the resulting NewRelic metric, and the duration field is set to zero. Array values for attributes OpenTelemetry metrics and other signals may include attributes that consist of a homogenous array of primitive types. These attributes are not supported by New Relic. Exemplars OpenTelemetry defines exemplar values that allow other signals, like traces, to be connected to a metric event and provide context. Exemplars are not supported by New Relic. How to query metrics Consider these tips for building metric NRQL queries in New Relic. Query cumulative sums stored as gauges Since cumulative sums are converted to gauges, here are some ways to query your data: Example: Raw gauge value for cumulative sums To view the raw gauge value for cumulative sums, you can use the latest() NRQL function: SELECT latest(totalApiBytesSent) FROM Metric TIMESERIES FACET description, statusCode Copy Example: Rate of change with cumulative sums as gauges To see the rate of change over a given time interval for a cumulative sum stored as a gauge, you can use the derivative() NRQL function: SELECT derivative(totalApiBytesSent, 1 second) FROM Metric TIMESERIES 5 MINUTES SLIDE BY 1 MINUTE FACET description, statusCode Copy New Relic does not currently support either reporting on resets and gaps or accounting for them with cumulative counters. Query gauge metrics When New Relic converts cumulative sums to gauges, you can query them using either the latest() or derivative() NRQL functions. The function you choose depends on whether you want to see the raw value or compute the rate of change. Query histogram metrics New Relic histograms translated from OpenTelemetry metrics have the same query semantics as other New Relic histograms. Namely, the histogram() NRQL function can be used to represent the histogram with a configurable number of buckets and bucket width. Note that you may see larger bucket counts at the endpoint buckets. This is because we are adding negative and positive infinity bound OpenTelemetry buckets into a zero width New Relic bucket. Example: Normal distribution FROM Metric SELECT histogram(test.histogram, buckets: 100, width: 1000) WHERE distributionType = 'Normal Distribution' SINCE 1 day ago Copy Example: Heat map The FACET keyword is also available to create heat map charts. FROM Metric SELECT histogram(test.histogram, buckets: 100, width: 1000) FACET distributionType SINCE 1 day ago Copy Important The TIMESERIES keyword is not supported for New Relic histograms. Logs Logs generated from your applications and environment are an important piece of telemetry. They may represent application logs, machine generated events, or system logs. OpenTelemetry has defined a log data model for representing log data. You can send logs using OpenTelemetry tooling, correlate them with applications, and view them in New Relic. Send logs to New Relic The OpenTelemetry Collector and OpenTelemetry Collector Contrib repositories contain a number of components for consuming log data. The general pattern is to configure the collector to: Receive logs from any of the log receivers. Some of the receiver options include Filelog Receiver, Fluent Forward Receiver, and Syslog Receiver. Process logs, potentially annotating them with resource information. Some of the processor options include Resource Detection Processor and Resource Processor. Export logs to New Relic via the OTLP exporter. Application log correlation Application logs are more useful if they're correlated with other telemetry data produced by the application. The OpenTelemetry semantic convention for services specifies service.name as a required field. All application metric, trace, and log data sent to New Relic with the same service.name are associated with the same entity. The specifics of how logs get annotated with the service.name resource attribute depends on the application's environment: Applications may produce structured JSON logs, which you can configure to include service.name as another field. You can deploy applications alongside a dedicated Collector Agent instance, which you can configure with a Resource Processor to annotate logs with the service.name attribute. Optionally, additional application trace context (sometimes called execution context) can be propagated to log messages. The setup and availability of this depends on the language and logging framework used by the application. The general strategy is to set up the application to write structured JSON logs and to configure it to extract trace context into specified trace context fields on available log messages. The Logs in Context with Log4j2 example in GitHub demonstrates an end-to-end working example for a simple Java application using Log4j2. View OpenTelemetry logs Here are two ways you can view logs: Look in the New Relic Logs UI. If your logs are correlated with an application, view them in the context of the application. The time field The timeUnixNano field is optional according to the OpenTelemetry specification for log data. When timeUnixNano is not present New Relic will use the time that the data was received for the New Relic log timestamp.",

Here's an overview of the process, followed by details for each step. Prerequisites Instrument your service with OpenTelemetry Export your telemetry data to New Relic View your data in the New Relic UI Step 1. Prerequisites First things first: If we don’t already know you, sign up for a free New Relic account. Copy your account license key. Step 2. Instrument your service with OpenTelemetry To get started, you instrument your service with OpenTelemetry. OpenTelemetry has language-specific products and SDKs to help you. Many languages offer out-the-box instrumentation for common libraries and frameworks. Each language also provides an API for further instrumenting your service manually. Go to the repository for your language and follow the instructions to instrument your service. When you're done, return here to complete Step 3. Export your telemetry data to New Relic. C++ Erlang Go Java Javascript/Node.js .NET PHP Python Ruby Rust Swift ...See a complete list of languages in GitHub Step 3. Export your telemetry data to New Relic The OpenTelemetry Protocol, or OTLP for short, is a general purpose telemetry data delivery protocol designed for the OpenTelemetry project. This protocol describes how to encode and transmit telemetry data, which makes it a natural choice for data transport. Each language SDK provides an OTLP exporter you can configure to export data over OTLP. In this step, we focus on how to configure an OTLP exporter in your service to export data directly to New Relic. If you prefer to export your data first to an OpenTelemetry collector, we have separate instructions. Here's an example of sending data from your service directly to New Relic. To complete this third step, first familiarize yourself with some required New Relic settings, and then complete the steps in the OTLP exporter documentation for your language. Review New Relic settings for exports Before you go to the external OTLP exporter documentation, consult the table below so you're ready to do the following: Configure the OTLP exporter to add a header (api-key) whose value is the license key for the New Relic account you want to send data to. Based on your region, configure the endpoint where the exporter sends data to New Relic. Region gRPC HTTP/1.1 Endpoint API header name API header value TLS encryption required US ✅ ❌ https://otlp.nr-data.net:4317 api-key License key ✅ EU ✅ ❌ https://otlp.eu01.nr-data.net:4317 api-key License key ✅ Important If you have FedRamp compliance constraints, you will need to use https://gov-otlp.nr-data.net:4317. Please see FedRAMP-compliant endpoints for further information. Important In Node.js, the opentelemetry-collector-grpc library requires additional options to enable TLS. Complete the export configuration steps Click on the link below for your language and complete the configuration steps. When you're done, return here to complete Step 4. View your data in the New Relic UI. C++ Erlang Go Java Javascript/Node.js .NET PHP Python Ruby Rust Swift ...Find additional OTLP language support in GitHub Export data to an OpenTelemetry Collector (optional) The OpenTelemetry Collector is a configurable and extensible software component to receive, process, and export telemetry data. When you set up a collector, it can operate as a gateway or as an agent: Gateway: The collector receives data from a variety of sources and applies standard processing before exporting to some backend. Agent: The collector is deployed on each host in an environment and can collect telemetry data about the host and processes running on it. When you use a collector, you start by following the same routine as above for setting up OTLP in your service. In this case, instead of exporting data directly to New Relic, you export through a collector that you set up. In the collector, you configure the OTLP exporter to export data to New Relic. When your data goes through a collector, the transport looks like this: Here's a Docker example of how to set up and run an OpenTelemetry collector with the collector YAML: Save the following as otel-config.yaml: receivers: otlp: protocols: grpc: http: processors: batch: exporters: otlp: endpoint: ${OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_ENDPOINT} headers: api-key: ${NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY} service: pipelines: traces: receivers: [otlp] processors: [batch] exporters: [otlp] metrics: receivers: [otlp] processors: [batch] exporters: [otlp] logs: receivers: [otlp] processors: [batch] exporters: [otlp] Copy Run the OpenTelemetry collector, making sure you replace OTLP_ENDPOINT_HERE with the appropriate endpoint and replace YOUR_KEY_HERE with your account's license key: export OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_ENDPOINT=OTLP_ENDPOINT_HERE export NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY=YOUR_KEY_HERE docker run --rm \\ -e OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_ENDPOINT \\ -e NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY \\ -p 4317:4317 \\ -v \"${PWD}/otel-config.yaml\":/otel-config.yaml \\ --config otel-config.yaml \\ --name otelcol \\ otel/opentelemetry-collector Copy Step 4. View your data in the New Relic UI Once you’ve instrumented your service and configured it to export its data to New Relic, watch the New Relic One user interface for your traces, metrics, and logs! The UI for OpenTelemetry has some similarities to the APM agent UI, so if you are familiar with that, you can go right to the UI.

      "body": "Troubleshooting OpenTelemetry with New Relic may just be a matter of making sure you are following best practices, but sometimes you may need to take additional steps to diagnose your issues. Here are some examples of specific problems you might encounter, along with steps and tools to resolve them. OpenTelemetry data sent via OTLP is not queryable Problem You sent OpenTelemetry metrics, logs, or traces using OTLP and are unable to view the data. Before digging deeper, make sure you've checked the following: The OTLP endpoint configured matches one of our documented endpoints, is properly formatted, and includes the official default port, 4317. Sending OTLP data via port 443 is not supported at this time. Please note the specific endpoint for FedRAMP compliance, if applicable. The outbound traffic is not restricted by a firewall. Our Networks document explains domains and network blocks that you may need to explicitly allow. The client is configured to use TLS 1.2 or higher and the request includes the api-key header with a valid New Relic account (ingest) license key. Requests include valid protobuf payloads and use gRPC and HTTP/2 transport, preferably with gzip compression enabled. Sending protobuf or JSON-encoded payloads over HTTP/1.1 is not supported at this time. Client output and logs do not indicate 4xx or 5xx response codes are being returned. Solution There are number of tools you can use to validate the successful delivery of telemetry data to our platform. A good first step is to check the data management hub to facet data ingest and determine how much data is arriving from various sources. You can also use the data explorer or query builder to look for data faceted by instrumentation.provider or newrelic.source attributes: FROM Log, Metric, Span SELECT datapointcount() WHERE instrumentation.provider = 'opentelemetry' FACET instrumentation.provider, newrelic.source Copy This query should tell you whether data is arriving via OTLP. If the data you expect is not present, try removing the WHERE clause or checking for integration errors. Querying NrIntegrationError events can help you determine whether you have configuration or format issues or if you've run into our platform limits. Important The ingest limits for metrics, logs, and traces via OTLP are the same as our other data ingest API limits. Various parts of the New Relic UI rely on the presence of specific attributes to function properly. You can use the NRQL console feature in many places to check the WHERE or FACET clauses of the query for required attributes. You can also edit those clauses and re-run the query to determine whether there is data present with those attributes missing. Examples of required attributes include service.name and service.instance.id. For a more complete list of examples, see resources. OpenTelemetry entities or relationships are missing Problem You sent OpenTelemetry data from a service or infrastructure component and either the entity or its relationships are missing or incorrect. Solution OpenTelemetry entities will be synthesized based on the public rules described for the EXT-SERVICE entity type. The standard rule to match relies on the presence of the service.name dimension which follows the OpenTelemetry semantic conventions. To set the service.name with the OpenTelemetry Java SDK, include it in your resource: var resource = Resource.getDefault() .merge(Resource.builder().put(SERVICE_NAME, serviceName).build()); Copy Depending on the SDK, you may also set the service.name by declaring it in the OTEL_RESOURCE_ATTRIBUTES or OTEL_SERVICE_NAME environment variables. For Logs, you can use a structured log template to inject the service.name. Here are some log examples: Setting the service name Logs in context with Log4j2 Tip For more OpenTelemetry examples with New Relic, visit the newrelic-opentelemetry-examples repository on GitHub.",

If you prefer to export your data first to an OpenTelemetry collector, we have separate instructions. Here's an example of sending data from your service directly to New Relic. To complete this third step, first familiarize yourself with some required New Relic settings, and then complete the steps in the OTLP exporter documentation for your language. Review New Relic settings for exports Before you go to the external OTLP exporter documentation, consult the table below so you're ready to do the following: Configure the OTLP exporter to add a header (api-key) whose value is the license key for the New Relic account you want to send data to. Based on your region, configure the endpoint where the exporter sends data to New Relic. Region gRPC HTTP/1.1 Endpoint API header name API header value TLS encryption required US ✅ ❌ https://otlp.nr-data.net:4317 api-key License key ✅ EU ✅ ❌ https://otlp.eu01.nr-data.net:4317 api-key License key ✅ Important If you have FedRamp compliance constraints, you will need to use https://gov-otlp.nr-data.net:4317. Please see FedRAMP-compliant endpoints for further information. Important In Node.js, the opentelemetry-collector-grpc library requires additional options to enable TLS. Complete the export configuration steps Click on the link below for your language and complete the configuration steps. When you're done, return here to complete Step 4. View your data in the New Relic UI. C++ Erlang Go Java Javascript/Node.js .NET PHP Python Ruby Rust Swift ...Find additional OTLP language support in GitHub Export data to an OpenTelemetry Collector (optional) The OpenTelemetry Collector is a configurable and extensible software component to receive, process, and export telemetry data. When you set up a collector, it can operate as a gateway or as an agent: Gateway: The collector receives data from a variety of sources and applies standard processing before exporting to some backend. Agent: The collector is deployed on each host in an environment and can collect telemetry data about the host and processes running on it. When you use a collector, you start by following the same routine as above for setting up OTLP in your service. In this case, instead of exporting data directly to New Relic, you export through a collector that you set up. In the collector, you configure the OTLP exporter to export data to New Relic. When your data goes through a collector, the transport looks like this: Here's a Docker example of how to set up and run an OpenTelemetry collector with the collector YAML: Save the following as otel-config.yaml: receivers: otlp: protocols: grpc: http: processors: batch: exporters: otlp: endpoint: ${OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_ENDPOINT} headers: api-key: ${NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY} service: pipelines: traces: receivers: [otlp] processors: [batch] exporters: [otlp] metrics: receivers: [otlp] processors: [batch] exporters: [otlp] logs: receivers: [otlp] processors: [batch] exporters: [otlp] Copy Run the OpenTelemetry collector, making sure you replace OTLP_ENDPOINT_HERE with the appropriate endpoint and replace YOUR_KEY_HERE with your account's license key: export OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_ENDPOINT=OTLP_ENDPOINT_HERE export NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY=YOUR_KEY_HERE docker run --rm \\ -e OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_ENDPOINT \\ -e NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY \\ -p 4317:4317 \\ -v \"${PWD}/otel-config.yaml\":/otel-config.yaml \\ --config otel-config.yaml \\ --name otelcol \\ otel/opentelemetry-collector Copy Step 4. View your data in the New Relic UI Once you’ve instrumented your service and configured it to export its data to New Relic, watch the New Relic One user interface for your traces, metrics, and logs! The UI for OpenTelemetry has some similarities to the APM agent UI, so if you are familiar with that, you can go right to the UI.

      "body": "Troubleshooting OpenTelemetry with New Relic may just be a matter of making sure you are following best practices, but sometimes you may need to take additional steps to diagnose your issues. Here are some examples of specific problems you might encounter, along with steps and tools to resolve them. OpenTelemetry data sent via OTLP is not queryable Problem You sent OpenTelemetry metrics, logs, or traces using OTLP and are unable to view the data. Before digging deeper, make sure you've checked the following: The OTLP endpoint configured matches one of our documented endpoints, is properly formatted, and includes the official default port, 4317. Sending OTLP data via port 443 is not supported at this time. Please note the specific endpoint for FedRAMP compliance, if applicable. The outbound traffic is not restricted by a firewall. Our Networks document explains domains and network blocks that you may need to explicitly allow. The client is configured to use TLS 1.2 or higher and the request includes the api-key header with a valid New Relic account (ingest) license key. Requests include valid protobuf payloads and use gRPC and HTTP/2 transport, preferably with gzip compression enabled. Sending protobuf or JSON-encoded payloads over HTTP/1.1 is not supported at this time. Client output and logs do not indicate 4xx or 5xx response codes are being returned. Solution There are number of tools you can use to validate the successful delivery of telemetry data to our platform. A good first step is to check the data management hub to facet data ingest and determine how much data is arriving from various sources. You can also use the data explorer or query builder to look for data faceted by instrumentation.provider or newrelic.source attributes: FROM Log, Metric, Span SELECT datapointcount() WHERE instrumentation.provider = 'opentelemetry' FACET instrumentation.provider, newrelic.source Copy This query should tell you whether data is arriving via OTLP. If the data you expect is not present, try removing the WHERE clause or checking for integration errors. Querying NrIntegrationError events can help you determine whether you have configuration or format issues or if you've run into our platform limits. Important The ingest limits for metrics, logs, and traces via OTLP are the same as our other data ingest API limits. Various parts of the New Relic UI rely on the presence of specific attributes to function properly. You can use the NRQL console feature in many places to check the WHERE or FACET clauses of the query for required attributes. You can also edit those clauses and re-run the query to determine whether there is data present with those attributes missing. Examples of required attributes include service.name and service.instance.id. For a more complete list of examples, see resources. OpenTelemetry entities or relationships are missing Problem You sent OpenTelemetry data from a service or infrastructure component and either the entity or its relationships are missing or incorrect. Solution OpenTelemetry entities will be synthesized based on the public rules described for the EXT-SERVICE entity type. The standard rule to match relies on the presence of the service.name dimension which follows the OpenTelemetry semantic conventions. To set the service.name with the OpenTelemetry Java SDK, include it in your resource: var resource = Resource.getDefault() .merge(Resource.builder().put(SERVICE_NAME, serviceName).build()); Copy Depending on the SDK, you may also set the service.name by declaring it in the OTEL_RESOURCE_ATTRIBUTES or OTEL_SERVICE_NAME environment variables. For Logs, you can use a structured log template to inject the service.name. Here are some log examples: Setting the service name Logs in context with Log4j2 Tip For more OpenTelemetry examples with New Relic, visit the newrelic-opentelemetry-examples repository on GitHub.",

      "body": "OpenTelemetry is a flexible toolkit that you can implement in a variety of ways. We recommend a basic four-step approach for setting up OpenTelemetry with New Relic. Here's an overview of the process, followed by details for each step. Prerequisites Instrument your service with OpenTelemetry Export your telemetry data to New Relic View your data in the New Relic UI Step 1. Prerequisites First things first: If we don’t already know you, sign up for a free New Relic account. Copy your account license key. Step 2. Instrument your service with OpenTelemetry To get started, you instrument your service with OpenTelemetry. OpenTelemetry has language-specific products and SDKs to help you. Many languages offer out-the-box instrumentation for common libraries and frameworks. Each language also provides an API for further instrumenting your service manually. Go to the repository for your language and follow the instructions to instrument your service. When you're done, return here to complete Step 3. Export your telemetry data to New Relic. C++ Erlang Go Java Javascript/Node.js .NET PHP Python Ruby Rust Swift ...See a complete list of languages in GitHub Step 3. Export your telemetry data to New Relic The OpenTelemetry Protocol, or OTLP for short, is a general purpose telemetry data delivery protocol designed for the OpenTelemetry project. This protocol describes how to encode and transmit telemetry data, which makes it a natural choice for data transport. Each language SDK provides an OTLP exporter you can configure to export data over OTLP. In this step, we focus on how to configure an OTLP exporter in your service to export data directly to New Relic. If you prefer to export your data first to an OpenTelemetry collector, we have separate instructions. Here's an example of sending data from your service directly to New Relic. To complete this third step, first familiarize yourself with some required New Relic settings, and then complete the steps in the OTLP exporter documentation for your language. Review New Relic settings for exports Before you go to the external OTLP exporter documentation, consult the table below so you're ready to do the following: Configure the OTLP exporter to add a header (api-key) whose value is the license key for the New Relic account you want to send data to. Based on your region, configure the endpoint where the exporter sends data to New Relic. Region gRPC HTTP/1.1 Endpoint API header name API header value TLS encryption required US ✅ ❌ https://otlp.nr-data.net:4317 api-key License key ✅ EU ✅ ❌ https://otlp.eu01.nr-data.net:4317 api-key License key ✅ Important If you have FedRamp compliance constraints, you will need to use https://gov-otlp.nr-data.net:4317. Please see FedRAMP-compliant endpoints for further information. Important In Node.js, the opentelemetry-collector-grpc library requires additional options to enable TLS. Complete the export configuration steps Click on the link below for your language and complete the configuration steps. When you're done, return here to complete Step 4. View your data in the New Relic UI. C++ Erlang Go Java Javascript/Node.js .NET PHP Python Ruby Rust Swift ...Find additional OTLP language support in GitHub Export data to an OpenTelemetry Collector (optional) The OpenTelemetry Collector is a configurable and extensible software component to receive, process, and export telemetry data. When you set up a collector, it can operate as a gateway or as an agent: Gateway: The collector receives data from a variety of sources and applies standard processing before exporting to some backend. Agent: The collector is deployed on each host in an environment and can collect telemetry data about the host and processes running on it. When you use a collector, you start by following the same routine as above for setting up OTLP in your service. In this case, instead of exporting data directly to New Relic, you export through a collector that you set up. In the collector, you configure the OTLP exporter to export data to New Relic. When your data goes through a collector, the transport looks like this: Here's a Docker example of how to set up and run an OpenTelemetry collector with the collector YAML: Save the following as otel-config.yaml: receivers: otlp: protocols: grpc: http: processors: batch: exporters: otlp: endpoint: ${OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_ENDPOINT} headers: api-key: ${NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY} service: pipelines: traces: receivers: [otlp] processors: [batch] exporters: [otlp] metrics: receivers: [otlp] processors: [batch] exporters: [otlp] logs: receivers: [otlp] processors: [batch] exporters: [otlp] Copy Run the OpenTelemetry collector, making sure you replace OTLP_ENDPOINT_HERE with the appropriate endpoint and replace YOUR_KEY_HERE with your account's license key: export OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_ENDPOINT=OTLP_ENDPOINT_HERE export NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY=YOUR_KEY_HERE docker run --rm \\ -e OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_ENDPOINT \\ -e NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY \\ -p 4317:4317 \\ -v \"${PWD}/otel-config.yaml\":/otel-config.yaml \\ --config otel-config.yaml \\ --name otelcol \\ otel/opentelemetry-collector Copy Step 4. View your data in the New Relic UI Once you’ve instrumented your service and configured it to export its data to New Relic, watch the New Relic One user interface for your traces, metrics, and logs! The UI for OpenTelemetry has some similarities to the APM agent UI, so if you are familiar with that, you can go right to the UI. If you need help understanding your OpenTelemetry UI options or how to make sure your data appears in the UI, see View your OpenTelemetry data in New Relic.

Here are some examples of specific problems you might encounter, along with steps and tools to resolve them. OpenTelemetry data sent via OTLP is not queryable Problem You sent OpenTelemetry metrics, logs, or traces using OTLP and are unable to view the data. Before digging deeper, make sure you've checked the following: The OTLP endpoint configured matches one of our documented endpoints, is properly formatted, and includes the official default port, 4317. Sending OTLP data via port 443 is not supported at this time. Please note the specific endpoint for FedRAMP compliance, if applicable. The outbound traffic is not restricted by a firewall. Our Networks document explains domains and network blocks that you may need to explicitly allow. The client is configured to use TLS 1.2 or higher and the request includes the api-key header with a valid New Relic account (ingest) license key. Requests include valid protobuf payloads and use gRPC and HTTP/2 transport, preferably with gzip compression enabled. Sending protobuf or JSON-encoded payloads over HTTP/1.1 is not supported at this time. Client output and logs do not indicate 4xx or 5xx response codes are being returned. Solution There are number of tools you can use to validate the successful delivery of telemetry data to our platform. A good first step is to check the data management hub to facet data ingest and determine how much data is arriving from various sources. You can also use the data explorer or query builder to look for data faceted by instrumentation.provider or newrelic.source attributes: FROM Log, Metric, Span SELECT datapointcount() WHERE instrumentation.provider = 'opentelemetry' FACET instrumentation.provider, newrelic.source Copy This query should tell you whether data is arriving via OTLP. If the data you expect is not present, try removing the WHERE clause or checking for integration errors. Querying NrIntegrationError events can help you determine whether you have configuration or format issues or if you've run into our platform limits. Important The ingest limits for metrics, logs, and traces via OTLP are the same as our other data ingest API limits. Various parts of the New Relic UI rely on the presence of specific attributes to function properly. You can use the NRQL console feature in many places to check the WHERE or FACET clauses of the query for required attributes. You can also edit those clauses and re-run the query to determine whether there is data present with those attributes missing. Examples of required attributes include service.name and service.instance.id. For a more complete list of examples, see resources. OpenTelemetry entities or relationships are missing Problem You sent OpenTelemetry data from a service or infrastructure component and either the entity or its relationships are missing or incorrect. Solution OpenTelemetry entities will be synthesized based on the public rules described for the EXT-SERVICE entity type. The standard rule to match relies on the presence of the service.name dimension which follows the OpenTelemetry semantic conventions. To set the service.name with the OpenTelemetry Java SDK, include it in your resource: var resource = Resource.getDefault() .merge(Resource.builder().put(SERVICE_NAME, serviceName).build()); Copy Depending on the SDK, you may also set the service.name by declaring it in the OTEL_RESOURCE_ATTRIBUTES or OTEL_SERVICE_NAME environment variables. For Logs, you can use a structured log template to inject the service.name.

If our pre-built quickstarts don't meet your needs, you can use the Telemetry SDKs to build your own telemetry tools. Under the hood, data reported by these solutions are ingested via our data ingest APIs. For example, metrics reported by the DropWizard exporter are ingested via the Metric API, so to understand how to query and chart that type of data, you could read Query metric data.",

      "body": "Here are some best practices based on how OpenTelemetry works with New Relic: Resources Batching Compression Traces Metrics Logs Tip For information about resolving specific issues, see our troubleshooting guide. Resources A resource in OpenTelemetry represents information about an entity generating telemetry data. All telemetry data sent to New Relic is expected to be associated with a resource so that it can be linked with the appropriate entity in New Relic. The OpenTelemetry Resource SDK specification defines the functionality implemented by all language SDKs for defining a resource. The following suites of attributes are defined by the OpenTelemetry resource semantic conventions. These attributes are usually set by creating a resource using the OpenTelemetry SDK. service.* attributes service.name attribute is required to associate your resource with an entity in the UI service.instance.id is required for certain panes to light up telemetry.sdk.language=java is required to see data in the JVM section Batching Caution Avoid getting rate limited! You should batch requests sent to the OTLP endpoint as described in this section. By default, the OpenTelemetry SDKs and Collector send one (1) data point per request. Using these defaults, it is likely your account will be rate limited. All OpenTelemetry SDKs and Collectors provide a BatchProcessor, which batches data points in memory. This batching allows requests to be sent with more than one (1) data point. Component Batch Processor Collector Batch Processor Go SDK BatchSpanProcessor JS SDK BatchSpanProcessor Python SDK BatchExportSpanProcessor Compression New Relic supports gzip compression for OTLP payloads exported over gRPC. To maximize the amount of data you can send per request, we recommend enabling compression in all OTLP exporters. If there are other compression formats you'd like to see us support, please let us know in the CNCF Slack channel. Traces Familiarize yourself with these trace topics to ensure your traces and spans appear in New Relic. Required fields The startTimeUnixNano and endTimeUnixNano fields on spans are required according to the OpenTelemetry protocol for trace data. When startTimeUnixNano is not present, the span is dropped and a NrIntegrationError is created. When endTimeUnixNano is not present, the duration of your span is large and negative. The timeUnixNano field on span events is required. When timeUnixNano is not present, the span event is dropped and a NrIntegrationError is created. The traceId and spanId fields on spans are required according to the OpenTelemetry protocol for trace data. When traceId or spanId are not present, the span is dropped and a NrIntegrationError is created. Sampling Trace data is the most mature OpenTelemetry data type. Because of this, New Relic's OpenTelemetry user experience is largely based on trace data and is therefore influenced by your sampling strategy. You can configure sampling in a number of places: Service: Use the OpenTelemetry SDK for your language. Collector: If you're running your own instance of the OpenTelemetry collector, you can configure it to do more sophisticated forms of sampling, such as tail-based sampling (see below). Check out this documentation about how to configure different types of sampling: OpenTelemetry built-in samplers Built-in samplers implemented by the OpenTelemetry SDK for each language. OpenTelemetry tail-based samplers The OpenTelemetry collector has a tail-based sampling processor. We have an example demonstrating the use of the tail-based sampling processor. New Relic tail-based sampling with Infinite Tracing Infinite Tracing is New Relic's tail-based sampling option. You can use this in conjunction with your OpenTelemetry instrumented services. In setting up Infinite Tracing, you need to override the default span endpoint and send telemetry data to the New Relic trace observer: Important Currently, Infinite Tracing does not support OTLP ingest. You must run your own instance of the OpenTelemetry Collector and configure it to use the New Relic exporter. Follow the steps in Set up the trace observer to get the value for YOUR_TRACE_OBSERVER_URL. Use the value of YOUR_TRACE_OBSERVER_URL to configure your integration. Since you want New Relic to analyze all your traces, make sure to verify that your OpenTelemetry integrations use the AlwaysOn sampler. Metrics OpenTelemetry metrics are largely compatible with New Relic dimensional metrics. We support OpenTelemetry metrics v0.10. All of the supported metric types include an independent set of associated attributes (name-value pairs) which map directly to dimensions you can use to facet or filter metric data at query time. OpenTelemetry metrics are accompanied by a set of resource attributes that identify the originating entity that produced them and map to dimensions for faceting and filtering. The OpenTelemetry data model for metrics defines a number of different metric types: sum, gauge, histogram, and summary. Sum metrics OpenTelemetry sums are a scalar metric that is the sum of all data points over a given time window. Sums have a notion of temporality indicating whether reported values incorporate previous measurements (cumulative temporality) or not (delta temporality). In addition, sums can either be monotonic (only go up or only go down) or non-monotonic (go up and down). Delta sums In New Relic, delta metrics are handled differently depending on whether they are monotonic or non-monotonic: Monotonic delta sums are mapped to the count metric type. Non-monotonic delta sums are mapped to the gauge metric type. Cumulative sums Monotonic and non-monotonic cumulative sums are mapped to the New Relic gauge metric type. Sum configuration examples To understand how to configure aggregation temporality, see these examples using the Java and Go OpenTelemetry SDKs. Gauge metrics OpenTelemetry gauge metric data points represent a sampled value at a given time. These values are converted to the New Relic gauge metric type. OpenTelemetry gauges do not have an aggregation temporality, but the sampled values can be aggregated at query time. Histogram metrics OpenTelemetry histograms compactly represent a population of recorded values along with a total count and sum. Optionally, histograms may include a series of buckets with explicit bounds and a count value for that bucket’s population. OpenTelemetry histograms are converted to New Relic’s distribution metric type, which is backed by a scaled exponential base 2 histogram (see NrSketch for a more thorough explanation). Counts from OpenTelemetry histogram buckets are assigned to New Relic’s distribution metric buckets using linear interpolation. Also, OpenTelemetry has negative and positive infinity bound buckets which we represent in New Relic as zero-width buckets. We do this because we do not have a representation for negative and positive infinity. For example, an OpenTelemetry bucket with bounds [-∞, 10) will be represented by a [10,10) zero width New Relic bucket. You may see exaggerated bucket counts at the endpoints of your distribution due to this translation. Summary metrics OpenTelemetry summary metric data points are used to represent quantile summaries (for example, P99 latency). These map directly to the New Relic summary metric type. Summary metric data points include count, sum, and quantile values, with 0.0 as min and 1.0 as max. OpenTelemetry provides summary metrics for compatibility with other formats. Start time The startTimeUnixNano field is optional according to the OpenTelemetry specification. When this field is provided, it is used for the timestamp on the resulting NewRelic metric, and the duration is calculated as timeUnixNano - startTimeUnixNano. The duration field is used to calculate the queryable endTimeStamp attribute on the New Relic metric, but it serves no other semantic purpose. If startTimeUnixNano is not provided, then timeUnixNano is used for the timestamp field on the resulting NewRelic metric, and the duration field is set to zero. Array values for attributes OpenTelemetry metrics and other signals may include attributes that consist of a homogenous array of primitive types. These attributes are not supported by New Relic. Exemplars OpenTelemetry defines exemplar values that allow other signals, like traces, to be connected to a metric event and provide context. Exemplars are not supported by New Relic. How to query metrics Consider these tips for building metric NRQL queries in New Relic. Query cumulative sums stored as gauges Since cumulative sums are converted to gauges, here are some ways to query your data: Example: Raw gauge value for cumulative sums To view the raw gauge value for cumulative sums, you can use the latest() NRQL function: SELECT latest(totalApiBytesSent) FROM Metric TIMESERIES FACET description, statusCode Copy Example: Rate of change with cumulative sums as gauges To see the rate of change over a given time interval for a cumulative sum stored as a gauge, you can use the derivative() NRQL function: SELECT derivative(totalApiBytesSent, 1 second) FROM Metric TIMESERIES 5 MINUTES SLIDE BY 1 MINUTE FACET description, statusCode Copy New Relic does not currently support either reporting on resets and gaps or accounting for them with cumulative counters. Query gauge metrics When New Relic converts cumulative sums to gauges, you can query them using either the latest() or derivative() NRQL functions. The function you choose depends on whether you want to see the raw value or compute the rate of change. Query histogram metrics New Relic histograms translated from OpenTelemetry metrics have the same query semantics as other New Relic histograms. Namely, the histogram() NRQL function can be used to represent the histogram with a configurable number of buckets and bucket width. Note that you may see larger bucket counts at the endpoint buckets. This is because we are adding negative and positive infinity bound OpenTelemetry buckets into a zero width New Relic bucket. Example: Normal distribution FROM Metric SELECT histogram(test.histogram, buckets: 100, width: 1000) WHERE distributionType = 'Normal Distribution' SINCE 1 day ago Copy Example: Heat map The FACET keyword is also available to create heat map charts. FROM Metric SELECT histogram(test.histogram, buckets: 100, width: 1000) FACET distributionType SINCE 1 day ago Copy Important The TIMESERIES keyword is not supported for New Relic histograms. Logs Logs generated from your applications and environment are an important piece of telemetry. They may represent application logs, machine generated events, or system logs. OpenTelemetry has defined a log data model for representing log data. You can send logs using OpenTelemetry tooling, correlate them with applications, and view them in New Relic. Send logs to New Relic The OpenTelemetry Collector and OpenTelemetry Collector Contrib repositories contain a number of components for consuming log data. The general pattern is to configure the collector to: Receive logs from any of the log receivers. Some of the receiver options include Filelog Receiver, Fluent Forward Receiver, and Syslog Receiver. Process logs, potentially annotating them with resource information. Some of the processor options include Resource Detection Processor and Resource Processor. Export logs to New Relic via the OTLP exporter. Application log correlation Application logs are more useful if they're correlated with other telemetry data produced by the application. The OpenTelemetry semantic convention for services specifies service.name as a required field. All application metric, trace, and log data sent to New Relic with the same service.name are associated with the same entity. The specifics of how logs get annotated with the service.name resource attribute depends on the application's environment: Applications may produce structured JSON logs, which you can configure to include service.name as another field. You can deploy applications alongside a dedicated Collector Agent instance, which you can configure with a Resource Processor to annotate logs with the service.name attribute. Optionally, additional application trace context (sometimes called execution context) can be propagated to log messages. The setup and availability of this depends on the language and logging framework used by the application. The general strategy is to set up the application to write structured JSON logs and to configure it to extract trace context into specified trace context fields on available log messages. The Logs in Context with Log4j2 example in GitHub demonstrates an end-to-end working example for a simple Java application using Log4j2. View OpenTelemetry logs Here are two ways you can view logs: Look in the New Relic Logs UI. If your logs are correlated with an application, view them in the context of the application. The time field The timeUnixNano field is optional according to the OpenTelemetry specification for log data. When timeUnixNano is not present New Relic will use the time that the data was received for the New Relic log timestamp.",

Prerequisites Instrument your service with OpenTelemetry Export your telemetry data to New Relic View your data in the New Relic UI Step 1. Prerequisites First things first: If we don’t already know you, sign up for a free New Relic account. Copy your account license key. Step 2. Instrument your service with OpenTelemetry To get started, you instrument your service with OpenTelemetry. OpenTelemetry has language-specific products and SDKs to help you. Many languages offer out-the-box instrumentation for common libraries and frameworks. Each language also provides an API for further instrumenting your service manually. Go to the repository for your language and follow the instructions to instrument your service. When you're done, return here to complete Step 3. Export your telemetry data to New Relic. C++ Erlang Go Java Javascript/Node.js .NET PHP Python Ruby Rust Swift ...See a complete list of languages in GitHub Step 3. Export your telemetry data to New Relic The OpenTelemetry Protocol, or OTLP for short, is a general purpose telemetry data delivery protocol designed for the OpenTelemetry project. This protocol describes how to encode and transmit telemetry data, which makes it a natural choice for data transport. Each language SDK provides an OTLP exporter you can configure to export data over OTLP. In this step, we focus on how to configure an OTLP exporter in your service to export data directly to New Relic. If you prefer to export your data first to an OpenTelemetry collector, we have separate instructions. Here's an example of sending data from your service directly to New Relic. To complete this third step, first familiarize yourself with some required New Relic settings, and then complete the steps in the OTLP exporter documentation for your language. Review New Relic settings for exports Before you go to the external OTLP exporter documentation, consult the table below so you're ready to do the following: Configure the OTLP exporter to add a header (api-key) whose value is the license key for the New Relic account you want to send data to. Based on your region, configure the endpoint where the exporter sends data to New Relic. Region gRPC HTTP/1.1 Endpoint API header name API header value TLS encryption required US ✅ ❌ https://otlp.nr-data.net:4317 api-key License key ✅ EU ✅ ❌ https://otlp.eu01.nr-data.net:4317 api-key License key ✅ Important If you have FedRamp compliance constraints, you will need to use https://gov-otlp.nr-data.net:4317. Please see FedRAMP-compliant endpoints for further information. Important In Node.js, the opentelemetry-collector-grpc library requires additional options to enable TLS. Complete the export configuration steps Click on the link below for your language and complete the configuration steps. When you're done, return here to complete Step 4. View your data in the New Relic UI. C++ Erlang Go Java Javascript/Node.js .NET PHP Python Ruby Rust Swift ...Find additional OTLP language support in GitHub Export data to an OpenTelemetry Collector (optional) The OpenTelemetry Collector is a configurable and extensible software component to receive, process, and export telemetry data. When you set up a collector, it can operate as a gateway or as an agent: Gateway: The collector receives data from a variety of sources and applies standard processing before exporting to some backend. Agent: The collector is deployed on each host in an environment and can collect telemetry data about the host and processes running on it. When you use a collector, you start by following the same routine as above for setting up OTLP in your service. In this case, instead of exporting data directly to New Relic, you export through a collector that you set up. In the collector, you configure the OTLP exporter to export data to New Relic. When your data goes through a collector, the transport looks like this: Here's a Docker example of how to set up and run an OpenTelemetry collector with the collector YAML: Save the following as otel-config.yaml: receivers: otlp: protocols: grpc: http: processors: batch: exporters: otlp: endpoint: ${OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_ENDPOINT} headers: api-key: ${NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY} service: pipelines: traces: receivers: [otlp] processors: [batch] exporters: [otlp] metrics: receivers: [otlp] processors: [batch] exporters: [otlp] logs: receivers: [otlp] processors: [batch] exporters: [otlp] Copy Run the OpenTelemetry collector, making sure you replace OTLP_ENDPOINT_HERE with the appropriate endpoint and replace YOUR_KEY_HERE with your account's license key: export OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_ENDPOINT=OTLP_ENDPOINT_HERE export NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY=YOUR_KEY_HERE docker run --rm \\ -e OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_ENDPOINT \\ -e NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY \\ -p 4317:4317 \\ -v \"${PWD}/otel-config.yaml\":/otel-config.yaml \\ --config otel-config.yaml \\ --name otelcol \\ otel/opentelemetry-collector Copy Step 4. View your data in the New Relic UI Once you’ve instrumented your service and configured it to export its data to New Relic, watch the New Relic One user interface for your traces, metrics, and logs! The UI for OpenTelemetry has some similarities to the APM agent UI, so if you are familiar with that, you can go right to the UI.

      "body": "Here are some best practices based on how OpenTelemetry works with New Relic: Resources Batching Compression Traces Metrics Logs Tip For information about resolving specific issues, see our troubleshooting guide. Resources A resource in OpenTelemetry represents information about an entity generating telemetry data. All telemetry data sent to New Relic is expected to be associated with a resource so that it can be linked with the appropriate entity in New Relic. The OpenTelemetry Resource SDK specification defines the functionality implemented by all language SDKs for defining a resource. The following suites of attributes are defined by the OpenTelemetry resource semantic conventions. These attributes are usually set by creating a resource using the OpenTelemetry SDK. service.* attributes service.name attribute is required to associate your resource with an entity in the UI service.instance.id is required for certain panes to light up telemetry.sdk.language=java is required to see data in the JVM section Batching Caution Avoid getting rate limited! You should batch requests sent to the OTLP endpoint as described in this section. By default, the OpenTelemetry SDKs and Collector send one (1) data point per request. Using these defaults, it is likely your account will be rate limited. All OpenTelemetry SDKs and Collectors provide a BatchProcessor, which batches data points in memory. This batching allows requests to be sent with more than one (1) data point. Component Batch Processor Collector Batch Processor Go SDK BatchSpanProcessor JS SDK BatchSpanProcessor Python SDK BatchExportSpanProcessor Compression New Relic supports gzip compression for OTLP payloads exported over gRPC. To maximize the amount of data you can send per request, we recommend enabling compression in all OTLP exporters. If there are other compression formats you'd like to see us support, please let us know in the CNCF Slack channel. Traces Familiarize yourself with these trace topics to ensure your traces and spans appear in New Relic. Required fields The startTimeUnixNano and endTimeUnixNano fields on spans are required according to the OpenTelemetry protocol for trace data. When startTimeUnixNano is not present, the span is dropped and a NrIntegrationError is created. When endTimeUnixNano is not present, the duration of your span is large and negative. The timeUnixNano field on span events is required. When timeUnixNano is not present, the span event is dropped and a NrIntegrationError is created. The traceId and spanId fields on spans are required according to the OpenTelemetry protocol for trace data. When traceId or spanId are not present, the span is dropped and a NrIntegrationError is created. Sampling Trace data is the most mature OpenTelemetry data type. Because of this, New Relic's OpenTelemetry user experience is largely based on trace data and is therefore influenced by your sampling strategy. You can configure sampling in a number of places: Service: Use the OpenTelemetry SDK for your language. Collector: If you're running your own instance of the OpenTelemetry collector, you can configure it to do more sophisticated forms of sampling, such as tail-based sampling (see below). Check out this documentation about how to configure different types of sampling: OpenTelemetry built-in samplers Built-in samplers implemented by the OpenTelemetry SDK for each language. OpenTelemetry tail-based samplers The OpenTelemetry collector has a tail-based sampling processor. We have an example demonstrating the use of the tail-based sampling processor. New Relic tail-based sampling with Infinite Tracing Infinite Tracing is New Relic's tail-based sampling option. You can use this in conjunction with your OpenTelemetry instrumented services. In setting up Infinite Tracing, you need to override the default span endpoint and send telemetry data to the New Relic trace observer: Important Currently, Infinite Tracing does not support OTLP ingest. You must run your own instance of the OpenTelemetry Collector and configure it to use the New Relic exporter. Follow the steps in Set up the trace observer to get the value for YOUR_TRACE_OBSERVER_URL. Use the value of YOUR_TRACE_OBSERVER_URL to configure your integration. Since you want New Relic to analyze all your traces, make sure to verify that your OpenTelemetry integrations use the AlwaysOn sampler. Metrics OpenTelemetry metrics are largely compatible with New Relic dimensional metrics. We support OpenTelemetry metrics v0.10. All of the supported metric types include an independent set of associated attributes (name-value pairs) which map directly to dimensions you can use to facet or filter metric data at query time. OpenTelemetry metrics are accompanied by a set of resource attributes that identify the originating entity that produced them and map to dimensions for faceting and filtering. The OpenTelemetry data model for metrics defines a number of different metric types: sum, gauge, histogram, and summary. Sum metrics OpenTelemetry sums are a scalar metric that is the sum of all data points over a given time window. Sums have a notion of temporality indicating whether reported values incorporate previous measurements (cumulative temporality) or not (delta temporality). In addition, sums can either be monotonic (only go up or only go down) or non-monotonic (go up and down). Delta sums In New Relic, delta metrics are handled differently depending on whether they are monotonic or non-monotonic: Monotonic delta sums are mapped to the count metric type. Non-monotonic delta sums are mapped to the gauge metric type. Cumulative sums Monotonic and non-monotonic cumulative sums are mapped to the New Relic gauge metric type. Sum configuration examples To understand how to configure aggregation temporality, see these examples using the Java and Go OpenTelemetry SDKs. Gauge metrics OpenTelemetry gauge metric data points represent a sampled value at a given time. These values are converted to the New Relic gauge metric type. OpenTelemetry gauges do not have an aggregation temporality, but the sampled values can be aggregated at query time. Histogram metrics OpenTelemetry histograms compactly represent a population of recorded values along with a total count and sum. Optionally, histograms may include a series of buckets with explicit bounds and a count value for that bucket’s population. OpenTelemetry histograms are converted to New Relic’s distribution metric type, which is backed by a scaled exponential base 2 histogram (see NrSketch for a more thorough explanation). Counts from OpenTelemetry histogram buckets are assigned to New Relic’s distribution metric buckets using linear interpolation. Also, OpenTelemetry has negative and positive infinity bound buckets which we represent in New Relic as zero-width buckets. We do this because we do not have a representation for negative and positive infinity. For example, an OpenTelemetry bucket with bounds [-∞, 10) will be represented by a [10,10) zero width New Relic bucket. You may see exaggerated bucket counts at the endpoints of your distribution due to this translation. Summary metrics OpenTelemetry summary metric data points are used to represent quantile summaries (for example, P99 latency). These map directly to the New Relic summary metric type. Summary metric data points include count, sum, and quantile values, with 0.0 as min and 1.0 as max. OpenTelemetry provides summary metrics for compatibility with other formats. Start time The startTimeUnixNano field is optional according to the OpenTelemetry specification. When this field is provided, it is used for the timestamp on the resulting NewRelic metric, and the duration is calculated as timeUnixNano - startTimeUnixNano. The duration field is used to calculate the queryable endTimeStamp attribute on the New Relic metric, but it serves no other semantic purpose. If startTimeUnixNano is not provided, then timeUnixNano is used for the timestamp field on the resulting NewRelic metric, and the duration field is set to zero. Array values for attributes OpenTelemetry metrics and other signals may include attributes that consist of a homogenous array of primitive types. These attributes are not supported by New Relic. Exemplars OpenTelemetry defines exemplar values that allow other signals, like traces, to be connected to a metric event and provide context. Exemplars are not supported by New Relic. How to query metrics Consider these tips for building metric NRQL queries in New Relic. Query cumulative sums stored as gauges Since cumulative sums are converted to gauges, here are some ways to query your data: Example: Raw gauge value for cumulative sums To view the raw gauge value for cumulative sums, you can use the latest() NRQL function: SELECT latest(totalApiBytesSent) FROM Metric TIMESERIES FACET description, statusCode Copy Example: Rate of change with cumulative sums as gauges To see the rate of change over a given time interval for a cumulative sum stored as a gauge, you can use the derivative() NRQL function: SELECT derivative(totalApiBytesSent, 1 second) FROM Metric TIMESERIES 5 MINUTES SLIDE BY 1 MINUTE FACET description, statusCode Copy New Relic does not currently support either reporting on resets and gaps or accounting for them with cumulative counters. Query gauge metrics When New Relic converts cumulative sums to gauges, you can query them using either the latest() or derivative() NRQL functions. The function you choose depends on whether you want to see the raw value or compute the rate of change. Query histogram metrics New Relic histograms translated from OpenTelemetry metrics have the same query semantics as other New Relic histograms. Namely, the histogram() NRQL function can be used to represent the histogram with a configurable number of buckets and bucket width. Note that you may see larger bucket counts at the endpoint buckets. This is because we are adding negative and positive infinity bound OpenTelemetry buckets into a zero width New Relic bucket. Example: Normal distribution FROM Metric SELECT histogram(test.histogram, buckets: 100, width: 1000) WHERE distributionType = 'Normal Distribution' SINCE 1 day ago Copy Example: Heat map The FACET keyword is also available to create heat map charts. FROM Metric SELECT histogram(test.histogram, buckets: 100, width: 1000) FACET distributionType SINCE 1 day ago Copy Important The TIMESERIES keyword is not supported for New Relic histograms. Logs Logs generated from your applications and environment are an important piece of telemetry. They may represent application logs, machine generated events, or system logs. OpenTelemetry has defined a log data model for representing log data. You can send logs using OpenTelemetry tooling, correlate them with applications, and view them in New Relic. Send logs to New Relic The OpenTelemetry Collector and OpenTelemetry Collector Contrib repositories contain a number of components for consuming log data. The general pattern is to configure the collector to: Receive logs from any of the log receivers. Some of the receiver options include Filelog Receiver, Fluent Forward Receiver, and Syslog Receiver. Process logs, potentially annotating them with resource information. Some of the processor options include Resource Detection Processor and Resource Processor. Export logs to New Relic via the OTLP exporter. Application log correlation Application logs are more useful if they're correlated with other telemetry data produced by the application. The OpenTelemetry semantic convention for services specifies service.name as a required field. All application metric, trace, and log data sent to New Relic with the same service.name are associated with the same entity. The specifics of how logs get annotated with the service.name resource attribute depends on the application's environment: Applications may produce structured JSON logs, which you can configure to include service.name as another field. You can deploy applications alongside a dedicated Collector Agent instance, which you can configure with a Resource Processor to annotate logs with the service.name attribute. Optionally, additional application trace context (sometimes called execution context) can be propagated to log messages. The setup and availability of this depends on the language and logging framework used by the application. The general strategy is to set up the application to write structured JSON logs and to configure it to extract trace context into specified trace context fields on available log messages. The Logs in Context with Log4j2 example in GitHub demonstrates an end-to-end working example for a simple Java application using Log4j2. View OpenTelemetry logs Here are two ways you can view logs: Look in the New Relic Logs UI. If your logs are correlated with an application, view them in the context of the application. The time field The timeUnixNano field is optional according to the OpenTelemetry specification for log data. When timeUnixNano is not present New Relic will use the time that the data was received for the New Relic log timestamp.",

Here's an overview of the process, followed by details for each step. Prerequisites Instrument your service with OpenTelemetry Export your telemetry data to New Relic View your data in the New Relic UI Step 1. Prerequisites First things first: If we don’t already know you, sign up for a free New Relic account. Copy your account license key. Step 2. Instrument your service with OpenTelemetry To get started, you instrument your service with OpenTelemetry. OpenTelemetry has language-specific products and SDKs to help you. Many languages offer out-the-box instrumentation for common libraries and frameworks. Each language also provides an API for further instrumenting your service manually. Go to the repository for your language and follow the instructions to instrument your service. When you're done, return here to complete Step 3. Export your telemetry data to New Relic. C++ Erlang Go Java Javascript/Node.js .NET PHP Python Ruby Rust Swift ...See a complete list of languages in GitHub Step 3. Export your telemetry data to New Relic The OpenTelemetry Protocol, or OTLP for short, is a general purpose telemetry data delivery protocol designed for the OpenTelemetry project. This protocol describes how to encode and transmit telemetry data, which makes it a natural choice for data transport. Each language SDK provides an OTLP exporter you can configure to export data over OTLP. In this step, we focus on how to configure an OTLP exporter in your service to export data directly to New Relic. If you prefer to export your data first to an OpenTelemetry collector, we have separate instructions. Here's an example of sending data from your service directly to New Relic. To complete this third step, first familiarize yourself with some required New Relic settings, and then complete the steps in the OTLP exporter documentation for your language. Review New Relic settings for exports Before you go to the external OTLP exporter documentation, consult the table below so you're ready to do the following: Configure the OTLP exporter to add a header (api-key) whose value is the license key for the New Relic account you want to send data to. Based on your region, configure the endpoint where the exporter sends data to New Relic. Region gRPC HTTP/1.1 Endpoint API header name API header value TLS encryption required US ✅ ❌ https://otlp.nr-data.net:4317 api-key License key ✅ EU ✅ ❌ https://otlp.eu01.nr-data.net:4317 api-key License key ✅ Important If you have FedRamp compliance constraints, you will need to use https://gov-otlp.nr-data.net:4317. Please see FedRAMP-compliant endpoints for further information. Important In Node.js, the opentelemetry-collector-grpc library requires additional options to enable TLS. Complete the export configuration steps Click on the link below for your language and complete the configuration steps. When you're done, return here to complete Step 4. View your data in the New Relic UI. C++ Erlang Go Java Javascript/Node.js .NET PHP Python Ruby Rust Swift ...Find additional OTLP language support in GitHub Export data to an OpenTelemetry Collector (optional) The OpenTelemetry Collector is a configurable and extensible software component to receive, process, and export telemetry data. When you set up a collector, it can operate as a gateway or as an agent: Gateway: The collector receives data from a variety of sources and applies standard processing before exporting to some backend. Agent: The collector is deployed on each host in an environment and can collect telemetry data about the host and processes running on it. When you use a collector, you start by following the same routine as above for setting up OTLP in your service. In this case, instead of exporting data directly to New Relic, you export through a collector that you set up. In the collector, you configure the OTLP exporter to export data to New Relic. When your data goes through a collector, the transport looks like this: Here's a Docker example of how to set up and run an OpenTelemetry collector with the collector YAML: Save the following as otel-config.yaml: receivers: otlp: protocols: grpc: http: processors: batch: exporters: otlp: endpoint: ${OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_ENDPOINT} headers: api-key: ${NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY} service: pipelines: traces: receivers: [otlp] processors: [batch] exporters: [otlp] metrics: receivers: [otlp] processors: [batch] exporters: [otlp] logs: receivers: [otlp] processors: [batch] exporters: [otlp] Copy Run the OpenTelemetry collector, making sure you replace OTLP_ENDPOINT_HERE with the appropriate endpoint and replace YOUR_KEY_HERE with your account's license key: export OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_ENDPOINT=OTLP_ENDPOINT_HERE export NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY=YOUR_KEY_HERE docker run --rm \\ -e OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_ENDPOINT \\ -e NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY \\ -p 4317:4317 \\ -v \"${PWD}/otel-config.yaml\":/otel-config.yaml \\ --config otel-config.yaml \\ --name otelcol \\ otel/opentelemetry-collector Copy Step 4. View your data in the New Relic UI Once you’ve instrumented your service and configured it to export its data to New Relic, watch the New Relic One user interface for your traces, metrics, and logs! The UI for OpenTelemetry has some similarities to the APM agent UI, so if you are familiar with that, you can go right to the UI.

      "body": "Troubleshooting OpenTelemetry with New Relic may just be a matter of making sure you are following best practices, but sometimes you may need to take additional steps to diagnose your issues. Here are some examples of specific problems you might encounter, along with steps and tools to resolve them. OpenTelemetry data sent via OTLP is not queryable Problem You sent OpenTelemetry metrics, logs, or traces using OTLP and are unable to view the data. Before digging deeper, make sure you've checked the following: The OTLP endpoint configured matches one of our documented endpoints, is properly formatted, and includes the official default port, 4317. Sending OTLP data via port 443 is not supported at this time. Please note the specific endpoint for FedRAMP compliance, if applicable. The outbound traffic is not restricted by a firewall. Our Networks document explains domains and network blocks that you may need to explicitly allow. The client is configured to use TLS 1.2 or higher and the request includes the api-key header with a valid New Relic account (ingest) license key. Requests include valid protobuf payloads and use gRPC and HTTP/2 transport, preferably with gzip compression enabled. Sending protobuf or JSON-encoded payloads over HTTP/1.1 is not supported at this time. Client output and logs do not indicate 4xx or 5xx response codes are being returned. Solution There are number of tools you can use to validate the successful delivery of telemetry data to our platform. A good first step is to check the data management hub to facet data ingest and determine how much data is arriving from various sources. You can also use the data explorer or query builder to look for data faceted by instrumentation.provider or newrelic.source attributes: FROM Log, Metric, Span SELECT datapointcount() WHERE instrumentation.provider = 'opentelemetry' FACET instrumentation.provider, newrelic.source Copy This query should tell you whether data is arriving via OTLP. If the data you expect is not present, try removing the WHERE clause or checking for integration errors. Querying NrIntegrationError events can help you determine whether you have configuration or format issues or if you've run into our platform limits. Important The ingest limits for metrics, logs, and traces via OTLP are the same as our other data ingest API limits. Various parts of the New Relic UI rely on the presence of specific attributes to function properly. You can use the NRQL console feature in many places to check the WHERE or FACET clauses of the query for required attributes. You can also edit those clauses and re-run the query to determine whether there is data present with those attributes missing. Examples of required attributes include service.name and service.instance.id. For a more complete list of examples, see resources. OpenTelemetry entities or relationships are missing Problem You sent OpenTelemetry data from a service or infrastructure component and either the entity or its relationships are missing or incorrect. Solution OpenTelemetry entities will be synthesized based on the public rules described for the EXT-SERVICE entity type. The standard rule to match relies on the presence of the service.name dimension which follows the OpenTelemetry semantic conventions. To set the service.name with the OpenTelemetry Java SDK, include it in your resource: var resource = Resource.getDefault() .merge(Resource.builder().put(SERVICE_NAME, serviceName).build()); Copy Depending on the SDK, you may also set the service.name by declaring it in the OTEL_RESOURCE_ATTRIBUTES or OTEL_SERVICE_NAME environment variables. For Logs, you can use a structured log template to inject the service.name. Here are some log examples: Setting the service name Logs in context with Log4j2 Tip For more OpenTelemetry examples with New Relic, visit the newrelic-opentelemetry-examples repository on GitHub.",

If our pre-built quickstarts don't meet your needs, you can use the Telemetry SDKs to build your own telemetry tools. Under the hood, data reported by these solutions are ingested via our data ingest APIs. For example, metrics reported by the DropWizard exporter are ingested via the Metric API, so to understand how to query and chart that type of data, you could read Query metric data.",

      "body": "NerdGraph is our GraphQL-format API that lets you query New Relic data and configure some New Relic features. After you sign up for a free New Relic account and install any of our monitoring services, you can get started with NerdGraph. What is NerdGraph? New Relic has several APIs. NerdGraph is the API we recommend for querying New Relic data and for performing some specific configurations (learn more about features). NerdGraph provides a single API interface for returning data from New Relic’s various APIs and microservices. Over time, other configuration capabilities will be added to NerdGraph. Important NerdGraph isn’t used for data ingest. For that, you'd use our data ingest APIs. NerdGraph is built using GraphQL, which is an open source API format that allows you to request exactly the data needed, with no over-fetching or under-fetching. For a lesson in how to use NerdGraph, watch this 7-minute video: Want to watch more video tutorials? Go to the New Relic University’s Intro to NerdGraph. Or see the online course on New Relic APIs. Use the GraphiQL explorer To get started using GraphQL, we recommend playing around with our GraphiQL explorer (GraphiQL is an open source graphical interface for using GraphQL). You can use it to explore our data schema, to read built-in object definitions, and to build and execute queries. To use GraphQL, you’ll need a user-specific New Relic API key called a user key. You can generate one or find an existing one from the GraphiQL explorer’s API key dropdown. To find the GraphiQL explorer: If your New Relic account uses an EU data center, go to api.eu.newrelic.com/graphiql. Otherwise use api.newrelic.com/graphiql. For tips on how to build queries, see Build queries. Requirements and endpoints To use NerdGraph, you need a New Relic user key, which can be generated and accessed from the GraphiQL explorer. The endpoints are: Main endpoint: https://api.newrelic.com/graphql Endpoint for accounts using EU data center: https://api.eu.newrelic.com/graphql To access the endpoint, use the following cURL command: curl -X POST https://api.newrelic.com/graphql \\ -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \\ -H 'API-Key: YOUR_NEW_RELIC_USER_KEY' \\ -d '{ \"query\": \"{ requestContext { userId apiKey } }\" } ' Copy What can you do with NerdGraph? NerdGraph functionality can be broken down into two main categories: Querying New Relic data. You can fetch data for a variety of purposes, including using it in a programmatic workflow, or building a New Relic One app for custom data visualizations. Configuring New Relic features. There are a variety of configurations available and more will be added over time. You can do things like add tags, configure workloads, or customize \"golden metrics.\" You can use NerdGraph to return a wide range of New Relic data but we’ve created some tutorials for common use cases: Topic Tutorials Your monitored entities Get data about entities Understand entity relationships and dependencies (used to build service maps) Query and configure \"golden metrics\" (important entity metrics) Querying data Query using NRQL (our query language) Tags Add and manage tags Dashboards Create dashboards Export dashboards to other accounts Export dashboards as files Migrate from Insights Dashboard API to NerdGraph Alerts See all alert-related tutorials Applied Intelligence View and configure topology Workloads View and configure workloads Service Levels Configure and manage Service Levels Manage keys Create and manage keys (license keys used for data ingest, and user keys) Manage data Convert event data to metric data Drop data Distributed tracing Query distributed tracing data Configure Infinite Tracing New Relic One apps Build a New Relic One app Cloud integrations (AWS, Azure, GCP) Configure cloud integrations Partners and resellers Manage subscriptions (only for partners using original pricing model) Data partitions Manage data partitions Date retention Manage data retention NerdGraph terminology The following are terms that originate with GraphQL (the API format NerdGraph uses). Term Definition Queries and mutations There are two classes of GraphQL operations: Queries are basic requests used only to fetch data. These queries are not static, meaning that you can ask for more data or less data, depending on your needs. For each query, you can specify exactly what data you want to retrieve, as long as it is supported by the schema. Mutations are requests that perform an action, such as creating a resource or changing configuration. Mutations require the keyword mutation, as well as the name of the mutation. Type Data in GraphQL is organized into types. Types can be scalars (like strings, numbers, or booleans) or object types. An object type is a custom type made up of a collection of fields. For example, an object type called User may represent a user in a system. Field A field represents a piece of information on an object type that can be queried. Fields can be scalars, lists, or objects. For example, a User object type could have a string field called name. Interface An interface is an abstract type that represents a collection of common fields that other object types can implement. Tips on using the GraphiQL explorer You can make queries with the NerdGraph GraphiQL explorer. The explorer provides built-in schema definitions and features, including auto-complete and query validation. Query accounts a New Relic user can access You can query for the name of an account that an actor (a New Relic authorized user) has access to: query { actor { account(id: YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID) { name } } } Copy The response will mirror the query structure you defined in the request, making it easy to ask for the specific data that you want. { \"data\": { \"actor\": { \"account\": { \"name\": \"Data Nerd\" } } } } Copy Query user, account, and NRQL in one request The graph structure shows its capabilities when queries become more complex. For example, you can query for user information, account information, and make a NRQL query with one request. With REST API, this would take three different requests to three different endpoints. query { actor { account(id: YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID) { name nrql(query: \"SELECT * FROM Transaction\") { results } } user { name id } } } Copy",

      "body": "New Relic allows you to group entities together in groupings called workloads. This enables better monitoring of the full stack used by a team or project. Here we show you how to use our NerdGraph API to do some workloads-related tasks: Get the workloads of an account Get the list of entities in a workload Get the status of a workload Create a workload Modify a workload Set a static status for a workload Modify the automatic status rules for a workload Duplicate a workload Delete a workload See also our post on how to customize the charts you see in your workload. Important You can also use the CLI and Terraform resource to automate these tasks. Get the workloads of an account To get all workloads of an account, use the following GraphQL query and pass the account ID via the id field. In this example, we retrieve three basic fields: guid: the workload GUID. name: the workload name. permalink: the permanent URLs on the New Relic One UI. { actor { account(id: YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID) { workload { collections { guid name permalink } } } } } Copy The response includes this type of data for each workload: { \"data\": { \"actor\": { \"account\": { \"workload\": { \"collections\": [ ..., { \"guid\": \"MTY...NTY\", \"name\": \"Acme Telco - Fulfillment Chain\", \"permalink\": \"https://one.newrelic.com/redirect/entity/MTY...NTY\" }, ... ] } } } }, \"extensions\": { ... } } Copy Get the list of entities in a workload You can get the entities that belong to a workload with the following query, just by passing the workload GUID (guid) as an argument. In this example we also retrieve some workload metadata: accountId: the workload account. name: the workload name. permalink: the workload permanent URL on the New Relic One UI. alertSeverity: the status of the workload. This value can have up to 10 minutes of delay; if you want to force the calculation of the workload status in query time, please use the Get the status of a workload example. The nested collection, members and results objects, which contain the actual list of entities: The name argument in the collection object takes the value WORKLOAD. count: Number of entities in the workload. { actor { entity(guid: \"YOUR_WORKLOAD_GUID\") { accountId name permalink ... on AlertableEntity { alertSeverity } ... on CollectionEntity { collection(name: \"WORKLOAD\") { members { count results { entities { accountId entityType name guid ... on AlertableEntityOutline { alertSeverity } } } } } } } } } Copy The query returns a list of entities that looks like this: { \"data\": { \"actor\": { \"entity\": { \"accountId\": 1606862, \"name\": \"Acme Telco - Ecommerce\", \"permalink\": \"https://one.newrelic.com/redirect/entity/MTYwNjg2MnxOUjF8V09SS0xPQUR8MTIyMzQ\", \"alertSeverity\": \"CRITICAL\", \"collection\": { \"members\": { \"count\": 201, \"results\": { \"entities\": [ { \"accountId\": 1606862, \"alertSeverity\": \"CRITICAL\", \"entityType\": \"APM_APPLICATION_ENTITY\", \"guid\": \"MTYwNjg2MnxBUE18QVBQTElDQVRJT058NDMxOTIwNTg\", \"name\": \"Fulfillment Service\" }, { \"accountId\": 1606862, \"alertSeverity\": \"NOT_ALERTING\", \"entityType\": \"INFRASTRUCTURE_HOST_ENTITY\", \"guid\": \"MTYwNjg2MnxJTkZSQXxOQXw3MDQzMzA2NzIyMjk2NDg4Mzc\", \"name\": \"ip-172-31-16-222\" }, { \"accountId\": 1606862, \"alertSeverity\": \"NOT_ALERTING\", \"entityType\": \"INFRASTRUCTURE_AWS_LAMBDA_FUNCTION_ENTITY\", \"guid\": \"MTYwNjg2MnxJTkZSQXxOQXw1MjMyNzM2ODgzNjAwNjYyMjE1\", \"name\": \"TelcoDT-purchase-log-lambda\" }, ... ] } } } } } } } Copy Get the status of a workload If you want to force the calculation of the status of a workload, you can use the following query, passing the account id (id) as the argument for the account field, and the workload GUID (guid) as the argument for the collection field. { actor { account(id: YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID) { workload { collection(guid: \"YOUR_WORKLOAD_GUID\") { guid status { value } } } } } } Copy And this is what you'll get in the response: { \"data\": { \"actor\": { \"account\": { \"workload\": { \"collection\": { \"guid\": \"MTYwNjg2MnxOUjF8V09SS0xPQUR8MTIyMzQ\", \"status\": { \"value\": \"OPERATIONAL\" } } } } } } } Copy Note that the DISRUPTED status value is a synonym for CRITICAL status. Create a workload The following is an example NerdGraph call that creates a workload using the workloadCreate mutation query: mutation { workloadCreate( accountId: NEW_WORKLOAD_ACCOUNT_ID, workload: { name: \"NAME_OF_WORKLOAD\", entityGuids: [\"ENTITY_GUID_1\", \"ENTITY_GUID_2\", ...], entitySearchQueries: [ { query: \"(type = 'SERVICE') and tags.label.environment = 'production'\" }, ... ], scopeAccounts: { accountIds: [NEW_RELIC_ACCOUNT_ID_1, NEW_RELIC_ACCOUNT_ID_2, ...] } } ) { guid } } Copy Some details on parts of this query: account: The workload account ID. Workloads can't be moved between accounts, so it's not possible to change this value later. name: A string with a user-friendly name for the workload. scopeAccounts: Scope accounts are the accounts where the entity data is fetched from. Scope accounts must belong to a group under the same parent account or enterprise partnership as the workload account. To define the entities in the workload, you can use one or both of these options: entitySearchQueries: This allows you to dynamically generate an array of entities. A name for each query is not needed. Here's an example dynamic query: (domain = 'INFRA' and type = 'HOST') and tags.label.environment = 'production' Copy entityGuids: This is for choosing specific entity GUIDs for inclusion in the workload. guid: This returns the workload guid. Because NerdGraph provides schema stitching, you can get other details about the workload, like the permalink. Modify a workload To modify a workload, use the workloadUpdate mutation. You must know the workload's guid. The workload account can't be changed. For the fields you can modify, see Create workloads. These additional rules apply: entitySearchQueries: This field must contain all the queries as you expect them to be stored. If you want to add a new query, include it in the query field and don't provide any query id. If you want to modify an existing query, include it in the query field and provide its existing id. If you want to delete an existing query, just don't add any query with that id anymore. Here's an example of the workloadUpdate query: mutation { workloadUpdate( guid: \"YOUR_WORKLOAD_GUID\", workload: { name: \"A new name for the workload\", entityGuids: [\"ENTITY_GUID_1\", \"ENTITY_GUID_2\", ...], entitySearchQueries: [ { query: \"(domain = 'INFRA' and type = 'HOST') and tags.label.environment = 'staging'\" }, { id: AN_EXISTING_QUERY_ID, query: \"(type = 'SERVICE') and tags.label.environment = 'staging'\" }, ... ], scopeAccounts: { accountIds: [NEW_RELIC_ACCOUNT_ID_1, NEW_RELIC_ACCOUNT_ID_2, ...] } } ) { guid } } Copy Set a static status for a workload You can set up a static status for a workload, which overrides any automatic status calculation. To set a static status, you must know the workload's guid and use the following fields: enabled: Remember to set this field to true to propagate the status value. status: The status value you want to set for this workload. Supported values are OPERATIONAL, DEGRADED or DISRUPTED. description: A text field to provide additional details. mutation { workloadUpdate( guid: \"YOUR_WORKLOAD_GUID\", workload: { statusConfig: { static: { enabled: true, status: DEGRADED, description: \"Game day. Expect some turbulence today between 8 and 9am PST.\" } } } ) { guid updatedAt status { value } } } Copy Modify the automatic status rules for a workload When you create a workload, you can use the statusConfig object to define which automatic rules you want to use to calculate the status of the workload. If you leave the rules array empty, no rules will be set up for your workload. However, if you just don't use the statusConfig object when you create a workload, the following rules will be added by default: \"statusConfig\": { \"automatic\": { \"enabled\": true, \"rules\": [ { \"entitySearchQueries\": [{\"query\": \"(domain = 'APM' and type = 'APPLICATION')\"}], \"rollup\": { \"strategy\": \"WORST_STATUS_WINS\", \"thresholdType\": null, \"thresholdValue\": null } }, { \"entitySearchQueries\": [{\"query\": \"(domain = 'MOBILE' and type = 'APPLICATION')\"}], \"rollup\": { \"strategy\": \"WORST_STATUS_WINS\", \"thresholdType\": null, \"thresholdValue\": null } }, { \"entitySearchQueries\": [{\"query\": \"(domain = 'BROWSER' and type = 'APPLICATION')\"}], \"rollup\": { \"strategy\": \"WORST_STATUS_WINS\", \"thresholdType\": null, \"thresholdValue\": null } }, { \"entitySearchQueries\": [{\"query\": \"(domain = 'SYNTH' and type = 'MONITOR')\"}], \"rollup\": { \"strategy\": \"WORST_STATUS_WINS\", \"thresholdType\": null, \"thresholdValue\": null } } ], \"remainingEntitiesRule\": { \"rollup\": { \"groupBy\": \"ENTITY_TYPE\", \"strategy\": \"BEST_STATUS_WINS\", \"thresholdType\": null, \"thresholdValue\": null } } } } Copy This is how you read the configuration: enabled: The automatic status calculation is enabled when this field is set to true. rules: An array of rules. In the default configuration, four rules are set for those entity types that are closer to the digital experience (that is, synthetic monitors, browser applications, mobile applications, and services). For each of these groups, the status of the unhealthiest rolls up. remainingEntitiesRule: This is the rule that will apply to all entities that haven't been evaluated in any other rule. In the default configuration, the remaining entities are grouped by entity type, and we make the status of each group to match that of its healthiest entity. If you want to modify these rules, you must use the workloadUpdate mutation, and send the complete new statusConfig object that you want to use. You can disable the automatic status calculation while keeping the configuration, by setting the statucConfig.automatic.enabled to false. Alternatively, you can delete all automatic regular rules by sending an empty array. And you can delete the rule for the remaining entities by just not adding the remainingEntitiesRule object. Duplicate a workload To duplicate a workload you first need to know its guid. In the workloadDuplicate mutation, you must pass as parameters: accountId: The account where you want to create the new workload. sourceGuid: the guid of the workload you want to duplicate. workload.name: Optional. You can specify a name for the new workload. If you don't specify one, the new workload will get the name of the original workload appended with - Copy. After duplicating a workload, you can modify it. mutation { workloadDuplicate( accountId: NEW_WORKLOAD_ACCOUNT_ID, sourceGuid: \"ORIGINAL_WORKLOAD_GUID\", workload: { name: \"New workload\" } ) { guid } } Copy Delete a workload To delete a workload, use the workloadDelete mutation and specify the workload GUID. When you delete a workload, all history and metadata is also deleted.",

To get better visibility into how your network is being used, set up network flow data monitoring. Visualize your network performance data in New Relic. Manual setup If you prefer to do the setup manually, proceed with the following steps. On a Linux host with Docker installed, download the ktranslate image from dockerhub by running bash Copy $ docker pull kentik/ktranslate:v2 Copy the snmp-base.yaml file to the local $HOME directory of your Docker user, and discard the container by running bash Copy $ cd . $ id=$(docker create kentik/ktranslate:v2) $ docker cp $id:/etc/ktranslate/snmp-base.yaml . $ docker rm -v $id Edit the snmp-base.yaml file and define the discovery.cidrs and discovery.default_communities attributes to appropriate values for your network. Tip It's recommended to set discovery.add_mibs: true to automate the addition of all discovered MIBs into the global.mibs_enabled attribute Launch a short-lived container to execute discovery by running bash Copy $ docker run -ti --name ktranslate-discovery --rm --net=host \\ > --user `id -u`:`id -g` \\ > -v `pwd`/snmp-base.yaml:/snmp-base.yaml \\ > kentik/ktranslate:v2 \\ > -snmp /snmp-base.yaml \\ > -log_level info \\ > -snmp_discovery=true After the discovery run finishes, you should see an output similar to the following: bash Copy $ >[Info] KTranslate Adding 3 new snmp devices to the config, 0 replaced from 3 $ # In this example, the discovery run found 3 new SNMP devices. The discovered devices are listed in the snmp-base.yaml file's devices.{} section. By default, only the IF-MIB mib is polled. You can manually add other mibs to the global.mibs_enabled attribute if you did not set discovery.add_mibs: true before running the discovery. Run ktranslate to poll target devices by running: bash Copy $ docker run -d --name ktranslate-snmp --restart unless-stopped --net=host \\ > -v `pwd`/snmp-base.yaml:/snmp-base.yaml \\ > -e NEW_RELIC_API_KEY=$YOUR_NR_LICENSE_KEY \\ > kentik/ktranslate:v2 \\ > -snmp /snmp-base.yaml \\ > -nr_account_id=$YOUR_NR_ACCOUNT_ID \\ > ## If your account is located in Europe, add the following flag: $ ## -nr_region=EU \\ $ ## If you want to use FedRAMP, add the following flag to use the FedRAMP authorized endpoints: $ ## -nr_region=GOV \\ $ -metrics=jchf \\ > -tee_logs=true \\ > -service_name=snmp \\ > nr1.snmp To get better visibility into how your network is being used, set up network flow data monitoring.

When running the ktranslate container, you will specify which major type you want to monitor using the -nf.source option. Important The ktranslate container only supports monitoring one type of network flow data type at a time. If you want to monitor several types, each will require a container. IPFIX and NetFlow v9 can be sent to the same container, but we recommend running a separate container as a best practice. Network flow data type -nf.source value IPFIX ipfix NetFlow v5 netflow5 NetFlow v9 netflow9 sFlow sflow AppFlow netflow5 Argus netflow5 cflowd netflow5 J-Flow netflow5 NetStream netflow5 RFlow netflow5 Cisco NSEL netflow9 Scaling network flow collection When planning your strategy for collecting network flows at scale, New Relic recommends 1 CPU per 2000 flows-per-second (120,000 flows-per-minute). Deciding whether to run more small containers to distribute load or fewer large containers to consolidate management is a matter of personal preference.

Manual setup If you prefer to do the setup manually, proceed with the following steps. In your local machine, from a Linux host with Docker installed, download the ktranslate image from dockerhub by running bash Copy $ docker pull kentik/ktranslate:v2 Copy the snmp-base.yaml file to the local $HOME directory of your Docker user, and discard the container by running bash Copy $ cd . $ id=$(docker create kentik/ktranslate:v2) $ docker cp $id:/etc/ktranslate/snmp-base.yaml . $ docker rm -v $id In the snmp-base.yaml file, add your network flow devices inside the devices key with the following structure: devices: flowDevice: device_name: edge-router device_ip: 10.10.1.254 flow_only: true # Optional user tags user_tags: owning_team: net_eng environment: production Copy Tip If you're already monitoring SNMP data devices that send network flow data, you don't need to add them in your snmp-base.yaml file a second time. Run ktranslate to listen for network flows by running: bash Copy $ docker run -d --name ktranslate-sflow --restart unless-stopped --net=host \\ > -v `pwd`/snmp-base.yaml:/snmp-base.yaml \\ > -e NEW_RELIC_API_KEY=$YOUR_NR_LICENSE_KEY \\ > kentik/ktranslate:v2 \\ > -snmp /snmp-base.yaml \\ > -nr_account_id=$YOUR_NR_ACCOUNT_ID \\ > ## If your account is located in Europe, add the following flag: $ ## -nr_region=EU \\ $ ## If you want to use FedRAMP, add the following flag to use the FedRAMP authorized endpoints: $ ## -nr_region=GOV \\ $ -metrics=jchf \\ > -tee_logs=true \\ > -flow_only=true \\ > -nf.source=sflow \\ > -service_name=sflow \\ > nr1.flow Tip This command assumes collection of sflow data. If you are collecting other flow types, you should change the suffix in the --name flag for the container and update the -nf.source and -service_name flags as necessary.

A New Relic license key. Read how to generate a new License key. AWS prerequisites AWS VPC Flow Export configured to existing S3 bucket. Permissions to build and publish images to Amazon ECR. Permissions to create a Lambda function. AWS CLI (v 1.9.15+) installed. Docker installed. Required fields from VPC flow logs Important The default format for flow logs does not include all of the required fields that are required for ktranslate to work properly. You must ensure that the below fields are added or the data you'll receive in New Relic One will be incomplete. Flow Record Field Description version The VPC Flow Logs version. srcaddr The source address for incoming traffic, or the IPv4 or IPv6 address of the network interface for outgoing traffic. For a network interface, the IPv4 address is always its private IPv4 address. dstaddr The destination address for outgoing traffic, or the IPv4 or IPv6 address of the network interface for incoming traffic. For a network interface, the IPv4 address is always its private IPv4 address. srcport The source port of the traffic. dstport The destination port of the traffic. protocol The IANA protocol number of the traffic. packets The number of packets transferred during the flow. bytes The number of bytes transferred during the flow. vpc-id The ID of the VPC that contains the network interface for which the traffic is recorded. flow-direction The direction of the flow with respect to the interface where traffic is captured. The possible values are ingress and egress. Set up AWS VPC flow logs monitoring in New Relic One To send your VPC flow logs to New Relic One, follow these steps: Create a private ECR registry and upload the ktranslate image Create a Lambda function from the ECR image Validate your settings 1. Create a private ECR registry and upload the ktranslate image Authenticate to your registry by running: bash Copy $ aws ecr get-login-password --region $AWS_ACCOUNT_REGION | docker login --username AWS --password-stdin $AWS_ACCOUNT_ID.dkr.ecr.$AWS_ACCOUNT_REGION.amazonaws.com Create a repository to hold the ktranslate image by running: bash Copy $ aws ecr create-repository --repository-name ktranslate --image-scanning-configuration scanOnPush=true --region $AWS_ACCOUNT_REGION Pull the ktranslate image from Docker Hub by running: bash Copy $ docker pull kentik/ktranslate:v2 Tag the image to push to your docker repository by running: bash Copy $ docker tag kentik/ktranslate:v2 $AWS_ACCOUNT_ID.dkr.ecr.$AWS_ACCOUNT_REGION.amazonaws.com/ktranslate:v2 Push the image to your docker repository by running: bash Copy $ docker push $AWS_ACCOUNT_ID.dkr.ecr.$AWS_ACCOUNT_REGION.amazonaws.com/ktranslate:v2 After running these steps, you should see an output similar to the following: bash Copy $ The push refers to repository [$AWS_ACCOUNT_ID.dkr.ecr.$AWS_ACCOUNT_REGION.amazonaws.com/ktranslate] $ 870d899ac0b0: Pushed $ 0a4768abd477: Pushed $ b206b92a2843: Pushed $ 22abafd3e6c9: Pushed $ 1335c3725252: Pushed $ 7188c9350e77: Pushed $ 2b75f71baacd: Pushed $ ba50c5652654: Pushed $ 80bbd31930ea: Pushed $ c3d2a28a326e: Pushed $ 1a058d5342cc: Pushed $ v2: digest: sha256:4cfe36919ae954063203a80f69ca1795280117c44947a09d678b4842bb8e4dd2 size: 2624 2. Create a Lambda function from the ECR image The Lambda function you create must reside in the same AWS Region as the S3 bucket where you store your VPC flow logs. To create a Lambda function defined as a container image, follow the following steps: Navigate to the Lambda service in your AWS console and select Create function. Select the Container image tile at the top of the screen, and: Name your function. Click Browse Images and choose the ktranslate image with the v2 tag you pushed to ECR. Keep the architecture on x86_64, accept the default permissions, and click Create function. On the landing page for your new function, select the Configuration tab, and: In General configuration, change the timeout value to 0 min 20 sec. In the Permissions section, click Execution role for your function, which will open a new tab for IAM. On the Permissions tab, select Attach policies and add the AmazonS3ReadOnlyAccess to grant your function access to the S3 bucket your VPC flow logs are in. Back on your function's landing page, in the Environment variables section, click Edit and add the Lambda environment variables. On the Triggers section, click Add trigger, and: Select the S3 type. Select the bucket where you store your VPC Flow Logs. Choose the All object create events event type. Optionally, if your bucket has a custom folder in the root directory outside the AWSLogs directory, you can add it in the Prefix section. Accept the Recursive Invocation warning and click Add. At this point, your Lambda function is deployed and listening for new events on your S3 bucket. 3. Validate your settings Tip It can take several minutes for data to first appear in your account as the export of VPC flow logs to S3 usually runs on a 5-minute cycle. To confirm your Lambda function is working as expected, do one of the following: Go to one.newrelic.com > Explorer and you will begin to see VPC Network entities. You can click them and investigate the various metrics each one is sending. Go to one.newrelic.com > Query your data and to get a quick summary of the recent VPCs that you have flow logs from, run the following NRQL query: FROM KFlow SELECT count(*) FACET device_name WHERE provider = 'kentik-vpc' Copy In your AWS Console, click the Monitor tab in your function's landing page, where you can track important metrics like invocation, error count, and success rate. You can also investigate the error logs from recent invocations. Tip We recommend you to add serverless monitoring from New Relic One to your new Lambda function. This way, you'll proactively monitor the health of the function and get alerts in case of problems. Find and use your metrics All VPC flow logs exported from the ktranslate Lambda function use the KFlow namespace, via the New Relic Event API. Currently, these are the fields populated from this integration: Attribute Type Description application String The class of program generating the traffic in this flow record. This is derived from the lowest numeric value from l4_dst_port and l4_src_port. Common examples include http, ssh, and ftp. dest_vpc String The name of the VPC the traffic in this flow record is targeting, if known. device_name String The name of the VPC this flow record was exported from. dst_addr String The target IPv4 address for this flow record. dst_as Numeric The target Autonomous System Number for this flow record. dst_as_name String The target Autonomous System Name for this flow record. dst_endpoint String The target IP:Port tuple for this flow record. This is a combination of dst_addr and l4_dst_port. dst_geo String The target country for this flow record, if known. flow_direction String The direction of flow for this record, from the point of view of the interface where the traffic was captured. Valid options are ingress | egress. in_bytes Numeric The number of bytes transferred for ingress flow records. in_pkts Numeric The number of packets transferred for ingress flow records. l4_dst_port Numeric The target port for this flow record. l4_src_port Numeric The source port for this flow record. out_bytes Numeric The number of bytes transferred for egress flow records. out_pkts Numeric The number of packets transferred for egress flow records. protocol String The display name of the protocol used in this flow record, derived from the numeric IANA protocol number provider String This attribute is used to uniquely identify various sources of data from ktranslate. VPC flow logs will always have the value of kentik-vpc. sample_rate Numeric The rate at which ktranslate samples from the various files in the S3 bucket for flow exports. (Default: 1000) This can be configured with the KENTIK_SAMPLE_RATE environment variable. source_vpc String The name of the VPC the traffic in this flow record originated from, if known. src_addr String The source IPv4 address for this flow record. src_as Numeric The source Autonomous System Number for this flow record. src_as_name String The source Autonomous System Name for this flow record. src_endpoint String The source IP:Port tuple for this flow record. This is a combination of src_addr and l4_src_port. src_geo String The source country for this flow record, if known. start_time Numeric The time, in Unix seconds, when the first packet of the flow was received within the aggregation interval. This might be up to 60 seconds after the packet was transmitted or received on the network interface. timestamp Numeric The time, in Unix seconds, when this flow record was received by the New Relic Event API. Environment variables for AWS Lambda functions When you're configuring your AWS Lambda function, you need to set up the following environment variables: Key Value Required KENTIK_MODE nr1.vpc.lambda √ NEW_RELIC_API_KEY The New Relic license key for your account √ NR_ACCOUNT_ID Your New Relic account ID √ NR_REGION The New Relic datacenter region for your account. The possible values are US and EU, and by default it's set to US. KENTIK_SAMPLE_RATE The rate of randomized sampling ktranslate applies to the flow export objects in S3. By default, it's set to 1000. Setting this to 1 disables all sampling and ktranslate ships all flow records to New Relic One. Tip For S3 objects with less than 100 flow records, ktranslate will revert to a sample rate of 1 and process every record. For S3 objects with more than 100 flow records, ktranslate will use the configured value of KENTIK_SAMPLE_RATE, which has a default of 1000. Meaning that every record in the object has a 1:1000 change of being sampled.",

To get better visibility into how your network is being used, set up network flow data monitoring. Visualize your network performance data in New Relic. Manual setup If you prefer to do the setup manually, proceed with the following steps. On a Linux host with Docker installed, download the ktranslate image from dockerhub by running bash Copy $ docker pull kentik/ktranslate:v2 Copy the snmp-base.yaml file to the local $HOME directory of your Docker user, and discard the container by running bash Copy $ cd . $ id=$(docker create kentik/ktranslate:v2) $ docker cp $id:/etc/ktranslate/snmp-base.yaml . $ docker rm -v $id Edit the snmp-base.yaml file and define the discovery.cidrs and discovery.default_communities attributes to appropriate values for your network. Tip It's recommended to set discovery.add_mibs: true to automate the addition of all discovered MIBs into the global.mibs_enabled attribute Launch a short-lived container to execute discovery by running bash Copy $ docker run -ti --name ktranslate-discovery --rm --net=host \\ > --user `id -u`:`id -g` \\ > -v `pwd`/snmp-base.yaml:/snmp-base.yaml \\ > kentik/ktranslate:v2 \\ > -snmp /snmp-base.yaml \\ > -log_level info \\ > -snmp_discovery=true After the discovery run finishes, you should see an output similar to the following: bash Copy $ >[Info] KTranslate Adding 3 new snmp devices to the config, 0 replaced from 3 $ # In this example, the discovery run found 3 new SNMP devices. The discovered devices are listed in the snmp-base.yaml file's devices.{} section. By default, only the IF-MIB mib is polled. You can manually add other mibs to the global.mibs_enabled attribute if you did not set discovery.add_mibs: true before running the discovery. Run ktranslate to poll target devices by running: bash Copy $ docker run -d --name ktranslate-snmp --restart unless-stopped --net=host \\ > -v `pwd`/snmp-base.yaml:/snmp-base.yaml \\ > -e NEW_RELIC_API_KEY=$YOUR_NR_LICENSE_KEY \\ > kentik/ktranslate:v2 \\ > -snmp /snmp-base.yaml \\ > -nr_account_id=$YOUR_NR_ACCOUNT_ID \\ > ## If your account is located in Europe, add the following flag: $ ## -nr_region=EU \\ $ ## If you want to use FedRAMP, add the following flag to use the FedRAMP authorized endpoints: $ ## -nr_region=GOV \\ $ -metrics=jchf \\ > -tee_logs=true \\ > -service_name=snmp \\ > nr1.snmp To get better visibility into how your network is being used, set up network flow data monitoring.

In your local machine, from a Linux host with Docker installed, download the ktranslate image from dockerhub by running bash Copy $ docker pull kentik/ktranslate:v2 Copy the snmp-base.yaml file to the local $HOME directory of your Docker user, and discard the container by running bash Copy $ cd . $ id=$(docker create kentik/ktranslate:v2) $ docker cp $id:/etc/ktranslate/snmp-base.yaml . $ docker rm -v $id In the snmp-base.yaml file, add your network flow devices inside the devices key with the following structure: devices: flowDevice: device_name: edge-router device_ip: 10.10.1.254 flow_only: true # Optional user tags user_tags: owning_team: net_eng environment: production Copy Tip If you're already monitoring SNMP data devices that send network flow data, you don't need to add them in your snmp-base.yaml file a second time. Run ktranslate to listen for network flows by running: bash Copy $ docker run -d --name ktranslate-sflow --restart unless-stopped --net=host \\ > -v `pwd`/snmp-base.yaml:/snmp-base.yaml \\ > -e NEW_RELIC_API_KEY=$YOUR_NR_LICENSE_KEY \\ > kentik/ktranslate:v2 \\ > -snmp /snmp-base.yaml \\ > -nr_account_id=$YOUR_NR_ACCOUNT_ID \\ > ## If your account is located in Europe, add the following flag: $ ## -nr_region=EU \\ $ ## If you want to use FedRAMP, add the following flag to use the FedRAMP authorized endpoints: $ ## -nr_region=GOV \\ $ -metrics=jchf \\ > -tee_logs=true \\ > -flow_only=true \\ > -nf.source=sflow \\ > -service_name=sflow \\ > nr1.flow Tip This command assumes collection of sflow data. If you are collecting other flow types, you should change the suffix in the --name flag for the container and update the -nf.source and -service_name flags as necessary.

Permissions to create a Lambda function. AWS CLI (v 1.9.15+) installed. Docker installed. Required fields from VPC flow logs Important The default format for flow logs does not include all of the required fields that are required for ktranslate to work properly. You must ensure that the below fields are added or the data you'll receive in New Relic One will be incomplete. Flow Record Field Description version The VPC Flow Logs version. srcaddr The source address for incoming traffic, or the IPv4 or IPv6 address of the network interface for outgoing traffic. For a network interface, the IPv4 address is always its private IPv4 address. dstaddr The destination address for outgoing traffic, or the IPv4 or IPv6 address of the network interface for incoming traffic. For a network interface, the IPv4 address is always its private IPv4 address. srcport The source port of the traffic. dstport The destination port of the traffic. protocol The IANA protocol number of the traffic. packets The number of packets transferred during the flow. bytes The number of bytes transferred during the flow. vpc-id The ID of the VPC that contains the network interface for which the traffic is recorded. flow-direction The direction of the flow with respect to the interface where traffic is captured. The possible values are ingress and egress. Set up AWS VPC flow logs monitoring in New Relic One To send your VPC flow logs to New Relic One, follow these steps: Create a private ECR registry and upload the ktranslate image Create a Lambda function from the ECR image Validate your settings 1. Create a private ECR registry and upload the ktranslate image Authenticate to your registry by running: bash Copy $ aws ecr get-login-password --region $AWS_ACCOUNT_REGION | docker login --username AWS --password-stdin $AWS_ACCOUNT_ID.dkr.ecr.$AWS_ACCOUNT_REGION.amazonaws.com Create a repository to hold the ktranslate image by running: bash Copy $ aws ecr create-repository --repository-name ktranslate --image-scanning-configuration scanOnPush=true --region $AWS_ACCOUNT_REGION Pull the ktranslate image from Docker Hub by running: bash Copy $ docker pull kentik/ktranslate:v2 Tag the image to push to your docker repository by running: bash Copy $ docker tag kentik/ktranslate:v2 $AWS_ACCOUNT_ID.dkr.ecr.$AWS_ACCOUNT_REGION.amazonaws.com/ktranslate:v2 Push the image to your docker repository by running: bash Copy $ docker push $AWS_ACCOUNT_ID.dkr.ecr.$AWS_ACCOUNT_REGION.amazonaws.com/ktranslate:v2 After running these steps, you should see an output similar to the following: bash Copy $ The push refers to repository [$AWS_ACCOUNT_ID.dkr.ecr.$AWS_ACCOUNT_REGION.amazonaws.com/ktranslate] $ 870d899ac0b0: Pushed $ 0a4768abd477: Pushed $ b206b92a2843: Pushed $ 22abafd3e6c9: Pushed $ 1335c3725252: Pushed $ 7188c9350e77: Pushed $ 2b75f71baacd: Pushed $ ba50c5652654: Pushed $ 80bbd31930ea: Pushed $ c3d2a28a326e: Pushed $ 1a058d5342cc: Pushed $ v2: digest: sha256:4cfe36919ae954063203a80f69ca1795280117c44947a09d678b4842bb8e4dd2 size: 2624 2. Create a Lambda function from the ECR image The Lambda function you create must reside in the same AWS Region as the S3 bucket where you store your VPC flow logs. To create a Lambda function defined as a container image, follow the following steps: Navigate to the Lambda service in your AWS console and select Create function. Select the Container image tile at the top of the screen, and: Name your function. Click Browse Images and choose the ktranslate image with the v2 tag you pushed to ECR. Keep the architecture on x86_64, accept the default permissions, and click Create function. On the landing page for your new function, select the Configuration tab, and: In General configuration, change the timeout value to 0 min 20 sec. In the Permissions section, click Execution role for your function, which will open a new tab for IAM. On the Permissions tab, select Attach policies and add the AmazonS3ReadOnlyAccess to grant your function access to the S3 bucket your VPC flow logs are in. Back on your function's landing page, in the Environment variables section, click Edit and add the Lambda environment variables. On the Triggers section, click Add trigger, and: Select the S3 type. Select the bucket where you store your VPC Flow Logs. Choose the All object create events event type. Optionally, if your bucket has a custom folder in the root directory outside the AWSLogs directory, you can add it in the Prefix section. Accept the Recursive Invocation warning and click Add. At this point, your Lambda function is deployed and listening for new events on your S3 bucket. 3. Validate your settings Tip It can take several minutes for data to first appear in your account as the export of VPC flow logs to S3 usually runs on a 5-minute cycle. To confirm your Lambda function is working as expected, do one of the following: Go to one.newrelic.com > Explorer and you will begin to see VPC Network entities. You can click them and investigate the various metrics each one is sending. Go to one.newrelic.com > Query your data and to get a quick summary of the recent VPCs that you have flow logs from, run the following NRQL query: FROM KFlow SELECT count(*) FACET device_name WHERE provider = 'kentik-vpc' Copy In your AWS Console, click the Monitor tab in your function's landing page, where you can track important metrics like invocation, error count, and success rate. You can also investigate the error logs from recent invocations. Tip We recommend you to add serverless monitoring from New Relic One to your new Lambda function. This way, you'll proactively monitor the health of the function and get alerts in case of problems. Find and use your metrics All VPC flow logs exported from the ktranslate Lambda function use the KFlow namespace, via the New Relic Event API. Currently, these are the fields populated from this integration: Attribute Type Description application String The class of program generating the traffic in this flow record. This is derived from the lowest numeric value from l4_dst_port and l4_src_port.

This is a combination of dst_addr and l4_dst_port. dst_geo String The target country for this flow record, if known. flow_direction String The direction of flow for this record, from the point of view of the interface where the traffic was captured. Valid options are ingress | egress. in_bytes Numeric The number of bytes transferred for ingress flow records. in_pkts Numeric The number of packets transferred for ingress flow records. l4_dst_port Numeric The target port for this flow record. l4_src_port Numeric The source port for this flow record. out_bytes Numeric The number of bytes transferred for egress flow records. out_pkts Numeric The number of packets transferred for egress flow records. protocol String The display name of the protocol used in this flow record, derived from the numeric IANA protocol number provider String This attribute is used to uniquely identify various sources of data from ktranslate. VPC flow logs will always have the value of kentik-vpc. sample_rate Numeric The rate at which ktranslate samples from the various files in the S3 bucket for flow exports. (Default: 1000) This can be configured with the KENTIK_SAMPLE_RATE environment variable. source_vpc String The name of the VPC the traffic in this flow record originated from, if known. src_addr String The source IPv4 address for this flow record. src_as Numeric The source Autonomous System Number for this flow record. src_as_name String The source Autonomous System Name for this flow record. src_endpoint String The source IP:Port tuple for this flow record. This is a combination of src_addr and l4_src_port. src_geo String The source country for this flow record, if known. start_time Numeric The time, in Unix seconds, when the first packet of the flow was received within the aggregation interval. This might be up to 60 seconds after the packet was transmitted or received on the network interface. timestamp Numeric The time, in Unix seconds, when this flow record was received by the New Relic Event API. Environment variables for AWS Lambda functions When you're configuring your AWS Lambda function, you need to set up the following environment variables: Key Value Required KENTIK_MODE nr1.vpc.lambda √ NEW_RELIC_API_KEY The New Relic license key for your account √ NR_ACCOUNT_ID Your New Relic account ID √ NR_REGION The New Relic datacenter region for your account. The possible values are US and EU, and by default it's set to US. KENTIK_SAMPLE_RATE The rate of randomized sampling ktranslate applies to the flow export objects in S3. By default, it's set to 1000. Setting this to 1 disables all sampling and ktranslate ships all flow records to New Relic One. Tip For S3 objects with less than 100 flow records, ktranslate will revert to a sample rate of 1 and process every record. For S3 objects with more than 100 flow records, ktranslate will use the configured value of KENTIK_SAMPLE_RATE, which has a default of 1000. Meaning that every record in the object has a 1:1000 change of being sampled.",

To get better visibility into how your network is being used, set up network flow data monitoring. Visualize your network performance data in New Relic. Manual setup If you prefer to do the setup manually, proceed with the following steps. On a Linux host with Docker installed, download the ktranslate image from dockerhub by running bash Copy $ docker pull kentik/ktranslate:v2 Copy the snmp-base.yaml file to the local $HOME directory of your Docker user, and discard the container by running bash Copy $ cd . $ id=$(docker create kentik/ktranslate:v2) $ docker cp $id:/etc/ktranslate/snmp-base.yaml . $ docker rm -v $id Edit the snmp-base.yaml file and define the discovery.cidrs and discovery.default_communities attributes to appropriate values for your network. Tip It's recommended to set discovery.add_mibs: true to automate the addition of all discovered MIBs into the global.mibs_enabled attribute Launch a short-lived container to execute discovery by running bash Copy $ docker run -ti --name ktranslate-discovery --rm --net=host \\ > --user `id -u`:`id -g` \\ > -v `pwd`/snmp-base.yaml:/snmp-base.yaml \\ > kentik/ktranslate:v2 \\ > -snmp /snmp-base.yaml \\ > -log_level info \\ > -snmp_discovery=true After the discovery run finishes, you should see an output similar to the following: bash Copy $ >[Info] KTranslate Adding 3 new snmp devices to the config, 0 replaced from 3 $ # In this example, the discovery run found 3 new SNMP devices. The discovered devices are listed in the snmp-base.yaml file's devices.{} section. By default, only the IF-MIB mib is polled. You can manually add other mibs to the global.mibs_enabled attribute if you did not set discovery.add_mibs: true before running the discovery. Run ktranslate to poll target devices by running: bash Copy $ docker run -d --name ktranslate-snmp --restart unless-stopped --net=host \\ > -v `pwd`/snmp-base.yaml:/snmp-base.yaml \\ > -e NEW_RELIC_API_KEY=$YOUR_NR_LICENSE_KEY \\ > kentik/ktranslate:v2 \\ > -snmp /snmp-base.yaml \\ > -nr_account_id=$YOUR_NR_ACCOUNT_ID \\ > ## If your account is located in Europe, add the following flag: $ ## -nr_region=EU \\ $ ## If you want to use FedRAMP, add the following flag to use the FedRAMP authorized endpoints: $ ## -nr_region=GOV \\ $ -metrics=jchf \\ > -tee_logs=true \\ > -service_name=snmp \\ > nr1.snmp To get better visibility into how your network is being used, set up network flow data monitoring.

Manual setup If you prefer to do the setup manually, proceed with the following steps. In your local machine, from a Linux host with Docker installed, download the ktranslate image from dockerhub by running bash Copy $ docker pull kentik/ktranslate:v2 Copy the snmp-base.yaml file to the local $HOME directory of your Docker user, and discard the container by running bash Copy $ cd . $ id=$(docker create kentik/ktranslate:v2) $ docker cp $id:/etc/ktranslate/snmp-base.yaml . $ docker rm -v $id In the snmp-base.yaml file, add your network flow devices inside the devices key with the following structure: devices: flowDevice: device_name: edge-router device_ip: 10.10.1.254 flow_only: true # Optional user tags user_tags: owning_team: net_eng environment: production Copy Tip If you're already monitoring SNMP data devices that send network flow data, you don't need to add them in your snmp-base.yaml file a second time. Run ktranslate to listen for network flows by running: bash Copy $ docker run -d --name ktranslate-sflow --restart unless-stopped --net=host \\ > -v `pwd`/snmp-base.yaml:/snmp-base.yaml \\ > -e NEW_RELIC_API_KEY=$YOUR_NR_LICENSE_KEY \\ > kentik/ktranslate:v2 \\ > -snmp /snmp-base.yaml \\ > -nr_account_id=$YOUR_NR_ACCOUNT_ID \\ > ## If your account is located in Europe, add the following flag: $ ## -nr_region=EU \\ $ ## If you want to use FedRAMP, add the following flag to use the FedRAMP authorized endpoints: $ ## -nr_region=GOV \\ $ -metrics=jchf \\ > -tee_logs=true \\ > -flow_only=true \\ > -nf.source=sflow \\ > -service_name=sflow \\ > nr1.flow Tip This command assumes collection of sflow data. If you are collecting other flow types, you should change the suffix in the --name flag for the container and update the -nf.source and -service_name flags as necessary.

Network flow data type -nf.source value IPFIX ipfix NetFlow v5 netflow5 NetFlow v9 netflow9 sFlow sflow AppFlow netflow5 Argus netflow5 cflowd netflow5 J-Flow netflow5 NetStream netflow5 RFlow netflow5 Cisco NSEL netflow9 Scaling network flow collection When planning your strategy for collecting network flows at scale, New Relic recommends 1 CPU per 2000 flows-per-second (120,000 flows-per-minute). Deciding whether to run more small containers to distribute load or fewer large containers to consolidate management is a matter of personal preference. Set up network flow data monitoring in New Relic One Go to one.newrelic.com and click Add more data. Scroll down until you see Network performance monitoring and click Network Flows. Follow the steps in New Relic One. one.newrelic.com > Add more data > Network performance monitoring > Network Flows to set up network flow data monitoring. To get better visibility into your network device performance, set up SNMP data monitoring. Visualize your network performance data in New Relic. Manual setup If you prefer to do the setup manually, proceed with the following steps. In your local machine, from a Linux host with Docker installed, download the ktranslate image from dockerhub by running bash Copy $ docker pull kentik/ktranslate:v2 Copy the snmp-base.yaml file to the local $HOME directory of your Docker user, and discard the container by running bash Copy $ cd . $ id=$(docker create kentik/ktranslate:v2) $ docker cp $id:/etc/ktranslate/snmp-base.yaml . $ docker rm -v $id In the snmp-base.yaml file, add your network flow devices inside the devices key with the following structure: devices: flowDevice: device_name: edge-router device_ip: 10.10.1.254 flow_only: true # Optional user tags user_tags: owning_team: net_eng environment: production Copy Tip If you're already monitoring SNMP data devices that send network flow data, you don't need to add them in your snmp-base.yaml file a second time. Run ktranslate to listen for network flows by running: bash Copy $ docker run -d --name ktranslate-sflow --restart unless-stopped --net=host \\ > -v `pwd`/snmp-base.yaml:/snmp-base.yaml \\ > -e NEW_RELIC_API_KEY=$YOUR_NR_LICENSE_KEY \\ > kentik/ktranslate:v2 \\ > -snmp /snmp-base.yaml \\ > -nr_account_id=$YOUR_NR_ACCOUNT_ID \\ > ## If your account is located in Europe, add the following flag: $ ## -nr_region=EU \\ $ ## If you want to use FedRAMP, add the following flag to use the FedRAMP authorized endpoints: $ ## -nr_region=GOV \\ $ -metrics=jchf \\ > -tee_logs=true \\ > -flow_only=true \\ > -nf.source=sflow \\ > -service_name=sflow \\ > nr1.flow Tip This command assumes collection of sflow data. If you are collecting other flow types, you should change the suffix in the --name flag for the container and update the -nf.source and -service_name flags as necessary.

Permissions to create a Lambda function. AWS CLI (v 1.9.15+) installed. Docker installed. Required fields from VPC flow logs Important The default format for flow logs does not include all of the required fields that are required for ktranslate to work properly. You must ensure that the below fields are added or the data you'll receive in New Relic One will be incomplete. Flow Record Field Description version The VPC Flow Logs version. srcaddr The source address for incoming traffic, or the IPv4 or IPv6 address of the network interface for outgoing traffic. For a network interface, the IPv4 address is always its private IPv4 address. dstaddr The destination address for outgoing traffic, or the IPv4 or IPv6 address of the network interface for incoming traffic. For a network interface, the IPv4 address is always its private IPv4 address. srcport The source port of the traffic. dstport The destination port of the traffic. protocol The IANA protocol number of the traffic. packets The number of packets transferred during the flow. bytes The number of bytes transferred during the flow. vpc-id The ID of the VPC that contains the network interface for which the traffic is recorded. flow-direction The direction of the flow with respect to the interface where traffic is captured. The possible values are ingress and egress. Set up AWS VPC flow logs monitoring in New Relic One To send your VPC flow logs to New Relic One, follow these steps: Create a private ECR registry and upload the ktranslate image Create a Lambda function from the ECR image Validate your settings 1. Create a private ECR registry and upload the ktranslate image Authenticate to your registry by running: bash Copy $ aws ecr get-login-password --region $AWS_ACCOUNT_REGION | docker login --username AWS --password-stdin $AWS_ACCOUNT_ID.dkr.ecr.$AWS_ACCOUNT_REGION.amazonaws.com Create a repository to hold the ktranslate image by running: bash Copy $ aws ecr create-repository --repository-name ktranslate --image-scanning-configuration scanOnPush=true --region $AWS_ACCOUNT_REGION Pull the ktranslate image from Docker Hub by running: bash Copy $ docker pull kentik/ktranslate:v2 Tag the image to push to your docker repository by running: bash Copy $ docker tag kentik/ktranslate:v2 $AWS_ACCOUNT_ID.dkr.ecr.$AWS_ACCOUNT_REGION.amazonaws.com/ktranslate:v2 Push the image to your docker repository by running: bash Copy $ docker push $AWS_ACCOUNT_ID.dkr.ecr.$AWS_ACCOUNT_REGION.amazonaws.com/ktranslate:v2 After running these steps, you should see an output similar to the following: bash Copy $ The push refers to repository [$AWS_ACCOUNT_ID.dkr.ecr.$AWS_ACCOUNT_REGION.amazonaws.com/ktranslate] $ 870d899ac0b0: Pushed $ 0a4768abd477: Pushed $ b206b92a2843: Pushed $ 22abafd3e6c9: Pushed $ 1335c3725252: Pushed $ 7188c9350e77: Pushed $ 2b75f71baacd: Pushed $ ba50c5652654: Pushed $ 80bbd31930ea: Pushed $ c3d2a28a326e: Pushed $ 1a058d5342cc: Pushed $ v2: digest: sha256:4cfe36919ae954063203a80f69ca1795280117c44947a09d678b4842bb8e4dd2 size: 2624 2. Create a Lambda function from the ECR image The Lambda function you create must reside in the same AWS Region as the S3 bucket where you store your VPC flow logs. To create a Lambda function defined as a container image, follow the following steps: Navigate to the Lambda service in your AWS console and select Create function. Select the Container image tile at the top of the screen, and: Name your function. Click Browse Images and choose the ktranslate image with the v2 tag you pushed to ECR. Keep the architecture on x86_64, accept the default permissions, and click Create function. On the landing page for your new function, select the Configuration tab, and: In General configuration, change the timeout value to 0 min 20 sec. In the Permissions section, click Execution role for your function, which will open a new tab for IAM. On the Permissions tab, select Attach policies and add the AmazonS3ReadOnlyAccess to grant your function access to the S3 bucket your VPC flow logs are in. Back on your function's landing page, in the Environment variables section, click Edit and add the Lambda environment variables. On the Triggers section, click Add trigger, and: Select the S3 type. Select the bucket where you store your VPC Flow Logs. Choose the All object create events event type. Optionally, if your bucket has a custom folder in the root directory outside the AWSLogs directory, you can add it in the Prefix section. Accept the Recursive Invocation warning and click Add. At this point, your Lambda function is deployed and listening for new events on your S3 bucket. 3. Validate your settings Tip It can take several minutes for data to first appear in your account as the export of VPC flow logs to S3 usually runs on a 5-minute cycle. To confirm your Lambda function is working as expected, do one of the following: Go to one.newrelic.com > Explorer and you will begin to see VPC Network entities. You can click them and investigate the various metrics each one is sending. Go to one.newrelic.com > Query your data and to get a quick summary of the recent VPCs that you have flow logs from, run the following NRQL query: FROM KFlow SELECT count(*) FACET device_name WHERE provider = 'kentik-vpc' Copy In your AWS Console, click the Monitor tab in your function's landing page, where you can track important metrics like invocation, error count, and success rate. You can also investigate the error logs from recent invocations. Tip We recommend you to add serverless monitoring from New Relic One to your new Lambda function. This way, you'll proactively monitor the health of the function and get alerts in case of problems. Find and use your metrics All VPC flow logs exported from the ktranslate Lambda function use the KFlow namespace, via the New Relic Event API. Currently, these are the fields populated from this integration: Attribute Type Description application String The class of program generating the traffic in this flow record. This is derived from the lowest numeric value from l4_dst_port and l4_src_port. Common examples include http, ssh, and ftp. dest_vpc String The name of the VPC the traffic in this flow record is targeting, if known. device_name String The name of the VPC this flow record was exported from. dst_addr String The target IPv4 address for this flow record. dst_as Numeric The target Autonomous System Number for this flow record. dst_as_name String The target Autonomous System Name for this flow record. dst_endpoint String The target IP:Port tuple for this flow record. This is a combination of dst_addr and l4_dst_port. dst_geo String The target country for this flow record, if known. flow_direction String The direction of flow for this record, from the point of view of the interface where the traffic was captured. Valid options are ingress | egress. in_bytes Numeric The number of bytes transferred for ingress flow records. in_pkts Numeric The number of packets transferred for ingress flow records. l4_dst_port Numeric The target port for this flow record. l4_src_port Numeric The source port for this flow record. out_bytes Numeric The number of bytes transferred for egress flow records. out_pkts Numeric The number of packets transferred for egress flow records. protocol String The display name of the protocol used in this flow record, derived from the numeric IANA protocol number provider String This attribute is used to uniquely identify various sources of data from ktranslate. VPC flow logs will always have the value of kentik-vpc. sample_rate Numeric The rate at which ktranslate samples from the various files in the S3 bucket for flow exports. (Default: 1000) This can be configured with the KENTIK_SAMPLE_RATE environment variable. source_vpc String The name of the VPC the traffic in this flow record originated from, if known. src_addr String The source IPv4 address for this flow record. src_as Numeric The source Autonomous System Number for this flow record. src_as_name String The source Autonomous System Name for this flow record. src_endpoint String The source IP:Port tuple for this flow record. This is a combination of src_addr and l4_src_port. src_geo String The source country for this flow record, if known. start_time Numeric The time, in Unix seconds, when the first packet of the flow was received within the aggregation interval. This might be up to 60 seconds after the packet was transmitted or received on the network interface. timestamp Numeric The time, in Unix seconds, when this flow record was received by the New Relic Event API. Environment variables for AWS Lambda functions When you're configuring your AWS Lambda function, you need to set up the following environment variables: Key Value Required KENTIK_MODE nr1.vpc.lambda √ NEW_RELIC_API_KEY The New Relic license key for your account √ NR_ACCOUNT_ID Your New Relic account ID √ NR_REGION The New Relic datacenter region for your account. The possible values are US and EU, and by default it's set to US. KENTIK_SAMPLE_RATE The rate of randomized sampling ktranslate applies to the flow export objects in S3. By default, it's set to 1000. Setting this to 1 disables all sampling and ktranslate ships all flow records to New Relic One. Tip For S3 objects with less than 100 flow records, ktranslate will revert to a sample rate of 1 and process every record. For S3 objects with more than 100 flow records, ktranslate will use the configured value of KENTIK_SAMPLE_RATE, which has a default of 1000. Meaning that every record in the object has a 1:1000 change of being sampled.",

To get better visibility into how your network is being used, set up network flow data monitoring. Visualize your network performance data in New Relic. Manual setup If you prefer to do the setup manually, proceed with the following steps. On a Linux host with Docker installed, download the ktranslate image from dockerhub by running bash Copy $ docker pull kentik/ktranslate:v2 Copy the snmp-base.yaml file to the local $HOME directory of your Docker user, and discard the container by running bash Copy $ cd . $ id=$(docker create kentik/ktranslate:v2) $ docker cp $id:/etc/ktranslate/snmp-base.yaml . $ docker rm -v $id Edit the snmp-base.yaml file and define the discovery.cidrs and discovery.default_communities attributes to appropriate values for your network. Tip It's recommended to set discovery.add_mibs: true to automate the addition of all discovered MIBs into the global.mibs_enabled attribute Launch a short-lived container to execute discovery by running bash Copy $ docker run -ti --name ktranslate-discovery --rm --net=host \\ > --user `id -u`:`id -g` \\ > -v `pwd`/snmp-base.yaml:/snmp-base.yaml \\ > kentik/ktranslate:v2 \\ > -snmp /snmp-base.yaml \\ > -log_level info \\ > -snmp_discovery=true After the discovery run finishes, you should see an output similar to the following: bash Copy $ >[Info] KTranslate Adding 3 new snmp devices to the config, 0 replaced from 3 $ # In this example, the discovery run found 3 new SNMP devices. The discovered devices are listed in the snmp-base.yaml file's devices.{} section. By default, only the IF-MIB mib is polled. You can manually add other mibs to the global.mibs_enabled attribute if you did not set discovery.add_mibs: true before running the discovery. Run ktranslate to poll target devices by running: bash Copy $ docker run -d --name ktranslate-snmp --restart unless-stopped --net=host \\ > -v `pwd`/snmp-base.yaml:/snmp-base.yaml \\ > -e NEW_RELIC_API_KEY=$YOUR_NR_LICENSE_KEY \\ > kentik/ktranslate:v2 \\ > -snmp /snmp-base.yaml \\ > -nr_account_id=$YOUR_NR_ACCOUNT_ID \\ > ## If your account is located in Europe, add the following flag: $ ## -nr_region=EU \\ $ ## If you want to use FedRAMP, add the following flag to use the FedRAMP authorized endpoints: $ ## -nr_region=GOV \\ $ -metrics=jchf \\ > -tee_logs=true \\ > -service_name=snmp \\ > nr1.snmp To get better visibility into how your network is being used, set up network flow data monitoring.

Permissions to create a Lambda function. AWS CLI (v 1.9.15+) installed. Docker installed. Required fields from VPC flow logs Important The default format for flow logs does not include all of the required fields that are required for ktranslate to work properly. You must ensure that the below fields are added or the data you'll receive in New Relic One will be incomplete. Flow Record Field Description version The VPC Flow Logs version. srcaddr The source address for incoming traffic, or the IPv4 or IPv6 address of the network interface for outgoing traffic. For a network interface, the IPv4 address is always its private IPv4 address. dstaddr The destination address for outgoing traffic, or the IPv4 or IPv6 address of the network interface for incoming traffic. For a network interface, the IPv4 address is always its private IPv4 address. srcport The source port of the traffic. dstport The destination port of the traffic. protocol The IANA protocol number of the traffic. packets The number of packets transferred during the flow. bytes The number of bytes transferred during the flow. vpc-id The ID of the VPC that contains the network interface for which the traffic is recorded. flow-direction The direction of the flow with respect to the interface where traffic is captured. The possible values are ingress and egress. Set up AWS VPC flow logs monitoring in New Relic One To send your VPC flow logs to New Relic One, follow these steps: Create a private ECR registry and upload the ktranslate image Create a Lambda function from the ECR image Validate your settings 1. Create a private ECR registry and upload the ktranslate image Authenticate to your registry by running: bash Copy $ aws ecr get-login-password --region $AWS_ACCOUNT_REGION | docker login --username AWS --password-stdin $AWS_ACCOUNT_ID.dkr.ecr.$AWS_ACCOUNT_REGION.amazonaws.com Create a repository to hold the ktranslate image by running: bash Copy $ aws ecr create-repository --repository-name ktranslate --image-scanning-configuration scanOnPush=true --region $AWS_ACCOUNT_REGION Pull the ktranslate image from Docker Hub by running: bash Copy $ docker pull kentik/ktranslate:v2 Tag the image to push to your docker repository by running: bash Copy $ docker tag kentik/ktranslate:v2 $AWS_ACCOUNT_ID.dkr.ecr.$AWS_ACCOUNT_REGION.amazonaws.com/ktranslate:v2 Push the image to your docker repository by running: bash Copy $ docker push $AWS_ACCOUNT_ID.dkr.ecr.$AWS_ACCOUNT_REGION.amazonaws.com/ktranslate:v2 After running these steps, you should see an output similar to the following: bash Copy $ The push refers to repository [$AWS_ACCOUNT_ID.dkr.ecr.$AWS_ACCOUNT_REGION.amazonaws.com/ktranslate] $ 870d899ac0b0: Pushed $ 0a4768abd477: Pushed $ b206b92a2843: Pushed $ 22abafd3e6c9: Pushed $ 1335c3725252: Pushed $ 7188c9350e77: Pushed $ 2b75f71baacd: Pushed $ ba50c5652654: Pushed $ 80bbd31930ea: Pushed $ c3d2a28a326e: Pushed $ 1a058d5342cc: Pushed $ v2: digest: sha256:4cfe36919ae954063203a80f69ca1795280117c44947a09d678b4842bb8e4dd2 size: 2624 2. Create a Lambda function from the ECR image The Lambda function you create must reside in the same AWS Region as the S3 bucket where you store your VPC flow logs. To create a Lambda function defined as a container image, follow the following steps: Navigate to the Lambda service in your AWS console and select Create function. Select the Container image tile at the top of the screen, and: Name your function. Click Browse Images and choose the ktranslate image with the v2 tag you pushed to ECR. Keep the architecture on x86_64, accept the default permissions, and click Create function. On the landing page for your new function, select the Configuration tab, and: In General configuration, change the timeout value to 0 min 20 sec. In the Permissions section, click Execution role for your function, which will open a new tab for IAM. On the Permissions tab, select Attach policies and add the AmazonS3ReadOnlyAccess to grant your function access to the S3 bucket your VPC flow logs are in. Back on your function's landing page, in the Environment variables section, click Edit and add the Lambda environment variables. On the Triggers section, click Add trigger, and: Select the S3 type. Select the bucket where you store your VPC Flow Logs. Choose the All object create events event type. Optionally, if your bucket has a custom folder in the root directory outside the AWSLogs directory, you can add it in the Prefix section. Accept the Recursive Invocation warning and click Add. At this point, your Lambda function is deployed and listening for new events on your S3 bucket. 3. Validate your settings Tip It can take several minutes for data to first appear in your account as the export of VPC flow logs to S3 usually runs on a 5-minute cycle. To confirm your Lambda function is working as expected, do one of the following: Go to one.newrelic.com > Explorer and you will begin to see VPC Network entities. You can click them and investigate the various metrics each one is sending. Go to one.newrelic.com > Query your data and to get a quick summary of the recent VPCs that you have flow logs from, run the following NRQL query: FROM KFlow SELECT count(*) FACET device_name WHERE provider = 'kentik-vpc' Copy In your AWS Console, click the Monitor tab in your function's landing page, where you can track important metrics like invocation, error count, and success rate. You can also investigate the error logs from recent invocations. Tip We recommend you to add serverless monitoring from New Relic One to your new Lambda function. This way, you'll proactively monitor the health of the function and get alerts in case of problems. Find and use your metrics All VPC flow logs exported from the ktranslate Lambda function use the KFlow namespace, via the New Relic Event API. Currently, these are the fields populated from this integration: Attribute Type Description application String The class of program generating the traffic in this flow record. This is derived from the lowest numeric value from l4_dst_port and l4_src_port. Common examples include http, ssh, and ftp. dest_vpc String The name of the VPC the traffic in this flow record is targeting, if known. device_name String The name of the VPC this flow record was exported from. dst_addr String The target IPv4 address for this flow record. dst_as Numeric The target Autonomous System Number for this flow record. dst_as_name String The target Autonomous System Name for this flow record. dst_endpoint String The target IP:Port tuple for this flow record. This is a combination of dst_addr and l4_dst_port. dst_geo String The target country for this flow record, if known. flow_direction String The direction of flow for this record, from the point of view of the interface where the traffic was captured. Valid options are ingress | egress. in_bytes Numeric The number of bytes transferred for ingress flow records. in_pkts Numeric The number of packets transferred for ingress flow records. l4_dst_port Numeric The target port for this flow record. l4_src_port Numeric The source port for this flow record. out_bytes Numeric The number of bytes transferred for egress flow records. out_pkts Numeric The number of packets transferred for egress flow records. protocol String The display name of the protocol used in this flow record, derived from the numeric IANA protocol number provider String This attribute is used to uniquely identify various sources of data from ktranslate. VPC flow logs will always have the value of kentik-vpc. sample_rate Numeric The rate at which ktranslate samples from the various files in the S3 bucket for flow exports. (Default: 1000) This can be configured with the KENTIK_SAMPLE_RATE environment variable. source_vpc String The name of the VPC the traffic in this flow record originated from, if known. src_addr String The source IPv4 address for this flow record. src_as Numeric The source Autonomous System Number for this flow record. src_as_name String The source Autonomous System Name for this flow record. src_endpoint String The source IP:Port tuple for this flow record. This is a combination of src_addr and l4_src_port. src_geo String The source country for this flow record, if known. start_time Numeric The time, in Unix seconds, when the first packet of the flow was received within the aggregation interval. This might be up to 60 seconds after the packet was transmitted or received on the network interface. timestamp Numeric The time, in Unix seconds, when this flow record was received by the New Relic Event API. Environment variables for AWS Lambda functions When you're configuring your AWS Lambda function, you need to set up the following environment variables: Key Value Required KENTIK_MODE nr1.vpc.lambda √ NEW_RELIC_API_KEY The New Relic license key for your account √ NR_ACCOUNT_ID Your New Relic account ID √ NR_REGION The New Relic datacenter region for your account. The possible values are US and EU, and by default it's set to US. KENTIK_SAMPLE_RATE The rate of randomized sampling ktranslate applies to the flow export objects in S3. By default, it's set to 1000. Setting this to 1 disables all sampling and ktranslate ships all flow records to New Relic One. Tip For S3 objects with less than 100 flow records, ktranslate will revert to a sample rate of 1 and process every record. For S3 objects with more than 100 flow records, ktranslate will use the configured value of KENTIK_SAMPLE_RATE, which has a default of 1000. Meaning that every record in the object has a 1:1000 change of being sampled.",

To get better visibility into how your network is being used, set up network flow data monitoring. Visualize your network performance data in New Relic. Manual setup If you prefer to do the setup manually, proceed with the following steps. On a Linux host with Docker installed, download the ktranslate image from dockerhub by running bash Copy $ docker pull kentik/ktranslate:v2 Copy the snmp-base.yaml file to the local $HOME directory of your Docker user, and discard the container by running bash Copy $ cd . $ id=$(docker create kentik/ktranslate:v2) $ docker cp $id:/etc/ktranslate/snmp-base.yaml . $ docker rm -v $id Edit the snmp-base.yaml file and define the discovery.cidrs and discovery.default_communities attributes to appropriate values for your network. Tip It's recommended to set discovery.add_mibs: true to automate the addition of all discovered MIBs into the global.mibs_enabled attribute Launch a short-lived container to execute discovery by running bash Copy $ docker run -ti --name ktranslate-discovery --rm --net=host \\ > --user `id -u`:`id -g` \\ > -v `pwd`/snmp-base.yaml:/snmp-base.yaml \\ > kentik/ktranslate:v2 \\ > -snmp /snmp-base.yaml \\ > -log_level info \\ > -snmp_discovery=true After the discovery run finishes, you should see an output similar to the following: bash Copy $ >[Info] KTranslate Adding 3 new snmp devices to the config, 0 replaced from 3 $ # In this example, the discovery run found 3 new SNMP devices. The discovered devices are listed in the snmp-base.yaml file's devices.{} section. By default, only the IF-MIB mib is polled. You can manually add other mibs to the global.mibs_enabled attribute if you did not set discovery.add_mibs: true before running the discovery. Run ktranslate to poll target devices by running: bash Copy $ docker run -d --name ktranslate-snmp --restart unless-stopped --net=host \\ > -v `pwd`/snmp-base.yaml:/snmp-base.yaml \\ > -e NEW_RELIC_API_KEY=$YOUR_NR_LICENSE_KEY \\ > kentik/ktranslate:v2 \\ > -snmp /snmp-base.yaml \\ > -nr_account_id=$YOUR_NR_ACCOUNT_ID \\ > ## If your account is located in Europe, add the following flag: $ ## -nr_region=EU \\ $ ## If you want to use FedRAMP, add the following flag to use the FedRAMP authorized endpoints: $ ## -nr_region=GOV \\ $ -metrics=jchf \\ > -tee_logs=true \\ > -service_name=snmp \\ > nr1.snmp To get better visibility into how your network is being used, set up network flow data monitoring.

When running the ktranslate container, you will specify which major type you want to monitor using the -nf.source option. Important The ktranslate container only supports monitoring one type of network flow data type at a time. If you want to monitor several types, each will require a container. IPFIX and NetFlow v9 can be sent to the same container, but we recommend running a separate container as a best practice. Network flow data type -nf.source value IPFIX ipfix NetFlow v5 netflow5 NetFlow v9 netflow9 sFlow sflow AppFlow netflow5 Argus netflow5 cflowd netflow5 J-Flow netflow5 NetStream netflow5 RFlow netflow5 Cisco NSEL netflow9 Scaling network flow collection When planning your strategy for collecting network flows at scale, New Relic recommends 1 CPU per 2000 flows-per-second (120,000 flows-per-minute). Deciding whether to run more small containers to distribute load or fewer large containers to consolidate management is a matter of personal preference.

Permissions to create a Lambda function. AWS CLI (v 1.9.15+) installed. Docker installed. Required fields from VPC flow logs Important The default format for flow logs does not include all of the required fields that are required for ktranslate to work properly. You must ensure that the below fields are added or the data you'll receive in New Relic One will be incomplete. Flow Record Field Description version The VPC Flow Logs version. srcaddr The source address for incoming traffic, or the IPv4 or IPv6 address of the network interface for outgoing traffic. For a network interface, the IPv4 address is always its private IPv4 address. dstaddr The destination address for outgoing traffic, or the IPv4 or IPv6 address of the network interface for incoming traffic. For a network interface, the IPv4 address is always its private IPv4 address. srcport The source port of the traffic. dstport The destination port of the traffic. protocol The IANA protocol number of the traffic. packets The number of packets transferred during the flow. bytes The number of bytes transferred during the flow. vpc-id The ID of the VPC that contains the network interface for which the traffic is recorded. flow-direction The direction of the flow with respect to the interface where traffic is captured. The possible values are ingress and egress. Set up AWS VPC flow logs monitoring in New Relic One To send your VPC flow logs to New Relic One, follow these steps: Create a private ECR registry and upload the ktranslate image Create a Lambda function from the ECR image Validate your settings 1. Create a private ECR registry and upload the ktranslate image Authenticate to your registry by running: bash Copy $ aws ecr get-login-password --region $AWS_ACCOUNT_REGION | docker login --username AWS --password-stdin $AWS_ACCOUNT_ID.dkr.ecr.$AWS_ACCOUNT_REGION.amazonaws.com Create a repository to hold the ktranslate image by running: bash Copy $ aws ecr create-repository --repository-name ktranslate --image-scanning-configuration scanOnPush=true --region $AWS_ACCOUNT_REGION Pull the ktranslate image from Docker Hub by running: bash Copy $ docker pull kentik/ktranslate:v2 Tag the image to push to your docker repository by running: bash Copy $ docker tag kentik/ktranslate:v2 $AWS_ACCOUNT_ID.dkr.ecr.$AWS_ACCOUNT_REGION.amazonaws.com/ktranslate:v2 Push the image to your docker repository by running: bash Copy $ docker push $AWS_ACCOUNT_ID.dkr.ecr.$AWS_ACCOUNT_REGION.amazonaws.com/ktranslate:v2 After running these steps, you should see an output similar to the following: bash Copy $ The push refers to repository [$AWS_ACCOUNT_ID.dkr.ecr.$AWS_ACCOUNT_REGION.amazonaws.com/ktranslate] $ 870d899ac0b0: Pushed $ 0a4768abd477: Pushed $ b206b92a2843: Pushed $ 22abafd3e6c9: Pushed $ 1335c3725252: Pushed $ 7188c9350e77: Pushed $ 2b75f71baacd: Pushed $ ba50c5652654: Pushed $ 80bbd31930ea: Pushed $ c3d2a28a326e: Pushed $ 1a058d5342cc: Pushed $ v2: digest: sha256:4cfe36919ae954063203a80f69ca1795280117c44947a09d678b4842bb8e4dd2 size: 2624 2. Create a Lambda function from the ECR image The Lambda function you create must reside in the same AWS Region as the S3 bucket where you store your VPC flow logs. To create a Lambda function defined as a container image, follow the following steps: Navigate to the Lambda service in your AWS console and select Create function. Select the Container image tile at the top of the screen, and: Name your function. Click Browse Images and choose the ktranslate image with the v2 tag you pushed to ECR. Keep the architecture on x86_64, accept the default permissions, and click Create function. On the landing page for your new function, select the Configuration tab, and: In General configuration, change the timeout value to 0 min 20 sec. In the Permissions section, click Execution role for your function, which will open a new tab for IAM. On the Permissions tab, select Attach policies and add the AmazonS3ReadOnlyAccess to grant your function access to the S3 bucket your VPC flow logs are in. Back on your function's landing page, in the Environment variables section, click Edit and add the Lambda environment variables. On the Triggers section, click Add trigger, and: Select the S3 type. Select the bucket where you store your VPC Flow Logs. Choose the All object create events event type. Optionally, if your bucket has a custom folder in the root directory outside the AWSLogs directory, you can add it in the Prefix section. Accept the Recursive Invocation warning and click Add. At this point, your Lambda function is deployed and listening for new events on your S3 bucket. 3. Validate your settings Tip It can take several minutes for data to first appear in your account as the export of VPC flow logs to S3 usually runs on a 5-minute cycle. To confirm your Lambda function is working as expected, do one of the following: Go to one.newrelic.com > Explorer and you will begin to see VPC Network entities. You can click them and investigate the various metrics each one is sending. Go to one.newrelic.com > Query your data and to get a quick summary of the recent VPCs that you have flow logs from, run the following NRQL query: FROM KFlow SELECT count(*) FACET device_name WHERE provider = 'kentik-vpc' Copy In your AWS Console, click the Monitor tab in your function's landing page, where you can track important metrics like invocation, error count, and success rate. You can also investigate the error logs from recent invocations. Tip We recommend you to add serverless monitoring from New Relic One to your new Lambda function. This way, you'll proactively monitor the health of the function and get alerts in case of problems. Find and use your metrics All VPC flow logs exported from the ktranslate Lambda function use the KFlow namespace, via the New Relic Event API. Currently, these are the fields populated from this integration: Attribute Type Description application String The class of program generating the traffic in this flow record. This is derived from the lowest numeric value from l4_dst_port and l4_src_port. Common examples include http, ssh, and ftp. dest_vpc String The name of the VPC the traffic in this flow record is targeting, if known. device_name String The name of the VPC this flow record was exported from. dst_addr String The target IPv4 address for this flow record. dst_as Numeric The target Autonomous System Number for this flow record. dst_as_name String The target Autonomous System Name for this flow record. dst_endpoint String The target IP:Port tuple for this flow record. This is a combination of dst_addr and l4_dst_port. dst_geo String The target country for this flow record, if known. flow_direction String The direction of flow for this record, from the point of view of the interface where the traffic was captured. Valid options are ingress | egress. in_bytes Numeric The number of bytes transferred for ingress flow records. in_pkts Numeric The number of packets transferred for ingress flow records. l4_dst_port Numeric The target port for this flow record. l4_src_port Numeric The source port for this flow record. out_bytes Numeric The number of bytes transferred for egress flow records. out_pkts Numeric The number of packets transferred for egress flow records. protocol String The display name of the protocol used in this flow record, derived from the numeric IANA protocol number provider String This attribute is used to uniquely identify various sources of data from ktranslate. VPC flow logs will always have the value of kentik-vpc. sample_rate Numeric The rate at which ktranslate samples from the various files in the S3 bucket for flow exports. (Default: 1000) This can be configured with the KENTIK_SAMPLE_RATE environment variable. source_vpc String The name of the VPC the traffic in this flow record originated from, if known. src_addr String The source IPv4 address for this flow record. src_as Numeric The source Autonomous System Number for this flow record. src_as_name String The source Autonomous System Name for this flow record. src_endpoint String The source IP:Port tuple for this flow record. This is a combination of src_addr and l4_src_port. src_geo String The source country for this flow record, if known. start_time Numeric The time, in Unix seconds, when the first packet of the flow was received within the aggregation interval. This might be up to 60 seconds after the packet was transmitted or received on the network interface. timestamp Numeric The time, in Unix seconds, when this flow record was received by the New Relic Event API. Environment variables for AWS Lambda functions When you're configuring your AWS Lambda function, you need to set up the following environment variables: Key Value Required KENTIK_MODE nr1.vpc.lambda √ NEW_RELIC_API_KEY The New Relic license key for your account √ NR_ACCOUNT_ID Your New Relic account ID √ NR_REGION The New Relic datacenter region for your account. The possible values are US and EU, and by default it's set to US. KENTIK_SAMPLE_RATE The rate of randomized sampling ktranslate applies to the flow export objects in S3. By default, it's set to 1000. Setting this to 1 disables all sampling and ktranslate ships all flow records to New Relic One. Tip For S3 objects with less than 100 flow records, ktranslate will revert to a sample rate of 1 and process every record. For S3 objects with more than 100 flow records, ktranslate will use the configured value of KENTIK_SAMPLE_RATE, which has a default of 1000. Meaning that every record in the object has a 1:1000 change of being sampled.",

The flow_only attribute on both a ktranslate docker container level and in the devices section of the snmp-base.yaml file allows you to get different results: If you have multiple containers collecting both SNMP and network flow data with the ktranslate docker image, define your devices in the snmp-base.yaml file, following the standards for SNMP data polling. They will be automatically matched to their respective flows based on their device_ip matching the sampling IP for the flow device. For network flow data devices, run the ktranslate docker image with the -flow_only=true option. snmp-base.yaml file - No setting changes needed If you have multiple containers collecting both SNMP and network flow data with the ktranslate docker image, and you have specific devices where you only want network flow or SNMP data collection and no SNMP or network flow data polling respectively, you can set them up in their respective device configuration section in the snmp-base.yaml file. For network flow data devices, run the ktranslate docker image with the -flow_only=true option. snmp-base.yaml file - Change the flow_only to true: flow_only: true Copy Advanced options for running the ktranslate docker image In this table you can find additional options you can use with the ktranslate docker image. Option name Description -max_threads Lets you process higher volumes of flow. We recommend one CPU core available for every 2,000 flows per second (fps) of network flow data sent. -sample_rate=100 Changes the default sample rate value at which flows are passed to New Relic One Events. It also sets the sample rate value for flow types that don't have a default sample rate value. -nf.workers=1 Overrides the number of workers used in processing udp packets. Use one worker for every 4,000 of flows per second (fps) of network flow data sent. -nf.port Overrides the default 9995 listening port for incoming flow packets. -listen Overrides the default 8082 port used by ktranslate to expose health metrics. You must use this option when running multiple ktranslate containers on a single host. -metalisten Overrides the default 8083 port used by ktranslate to expose metadata. You must use this option when running multiple ktranslate containers on a single host. -metrics=jchf Forwards health metrics from ktranslate into New Relic One. -log_level Overrides the default info log level for ktranslate. The available options are debug, info, warn, or error. -tee_logs Forwards logs from ktranslate into New Relic One Logs. HTTPS_PROXY Environment variable that can be used during Docker runtime to setup ktranslate to ship data to New Relic via proxy. Ex: -e HTTPS_PROXY=https://user:password@hostname:port You can also run several ktranslate images to monitor different network flow types simultaneously. See the follwing example: bash Copy $ docker run -d --name ktranslate-sflow --net=host \\ > -e NEW_RELIC_API_KEY=$INSERT_API_KEY \\ > kentik/ktranslate:v2 \\ > -snmp /snmp-base.yaml \\ > -nr_account_id=$NR_ACCOUNT_ID \\ > -metrics=jchf \\ > -log_level=info \\ > -tee_logs=true \\ > -nf.source=sflow \\ > -nf.port=9996 \\ > -max_threads=1 \\ > -listen 0.0.0.0:8084 \\ > -metalisten 0.0.0.0:8085 \\ > nr1.flow $ $ $ docker run -d --name ktranslate-netflow9 --net=host \\ > -e NEW_RELIC_API_KEY=$INSERT_API_KEY \\ > kentik/ktranslate:v2 \\ > -snmp /snmp-base.yaml \\ > -nr_account_id=$NR_ACCOUNT_ID \\ > -metrics=jchf \\ > -log_level=info \\ > -tee_logs=true \\ > -nf.source=netflow9 \\ > -nf.port=2055 \\ > -max_threads=2 \\ > -listen 0.0.0.0:8086 \\ > -metalisten 0.0.0.0:8087 \\ > nr1.flow Logs sent with Network performance monitoring If you want to check the logs locally, run docker logs ktranslate-snmp. The -tee_logs=true option sends logs to New Relic One when polling devices. To see them, do the following: Go to one.newrelic.com > Logs. In Find logs where enter collector.name:\"ktranslate\" and click Query logs. Tip If you want to filter out all the information messages, enter collector.name:\"ktranslate\" message:-*\\[Info\\]*. Metrics sent with Network performance monitoring The -metrics option captures one of the following performance metrics when polling devices: Metric Description baseserver_healthcheck_execution_total Rate of internal health checks. Shows mostly that things are not deadlocked. delivery_metrics_nr Rate of metrics sent to New Relic One. delivery_logs_nr Rate of logs sent to New Relic One. delivery_wins_nr Rate of 200 HTTP codes received from sending metrics and events to New Relic One. device_metrics Rate of SNMP polling of device level metrics. inputq Messages per second (msg/sec) recieved over the last 60 seconds from SNMP or network flow devices. interface_metrics Rate of SNMP polling of interface level metrics. jchfq Gauge rate with number of available pre-allocated buffers. It should be 8,000 aproximately. To see these metrics in New Relic One: Go to one.newrelic.com and click Query your data. Enter the following NRQL query: FROM Metric SELECT latest(kentik.ktranslate.chf.kkc.baseserver_healthcheck_execution_total) AS 'baseserver_healthcheck_execution_total', latest(kentik.ktranslate.chf.kkc.delivery_metrics_nr) AS 'delivery_metrics_nr', latest(kentik.ktranslate.chf.kkc.delivery_logs_nr) AS 'delivery_logs_nr', latest(kentik.ktranslate.chf.kkc.delivery_wins_nr) AS 'delivery_wins_nr', latest(kentik.ktranslate.chf.kkc.device_metrics) AS 'device_metrics', latest(kentik.ktranslate.chf.kkc.inputq) AS 'inputq', latest(kentik.ktranslate.chf.kkc.interface_metrics) AS 'interface_metrics', latest(kentik.ktranslate.chf.kkc.jchfq) AS 'jchfq' WHERE provider = 'kentik-agent' AND instrumentation.name = 'heartbeat' LIMIT MAX Copy",

Tip It's recommended to set discovery.add_mibs: true to automate the addition of all discovered MIBs into the global.mibs_enabled attribute Launch a short-lived container to execute discovery by running bash Copy $ docker run -ti --name ktranslate-discovery --rm --net=host \\ > --user `id -u`:`id -g` \\ > -v `pwd`/snmp-base.yaml:/snmp-base.yaml \\ > kentik/ktranslate:v2 \\ > -snmp /snmp-base.yaml \\ > -log_level info \\ > -snmp_discovery=true After the discovery run finishes, you should see an output similar to the following: bash Copy $ >[Info] KTranslate Adding 3 new snmp devices to the config, 0 replaced from 3 $ # In this example, the discovery run found 3 new SNMP devices. The discovered devices are listed in the snmp-base.yaml file's devices.{} section. By default, only the IF-MIB mib is polled. You can manually add other mibs to the global.mibs_enabled attribute if you did not set discovery.add_mibs: true before running the discovery.

      "body": "Problem You are having trouble collecting SNMP metrics from your device or you need to see what specific Object Identifiers (OIDs) your device supports. Solutions The snmpwalk utility is a useful tool for troubleshooting various SNMP challenges you may encounter. Because ktranslate runs on the host network of the Linux host that Docker is running on top of, it is an accurate measurement of whether or not your devices are responding to SNMP requests and what specifically they are responding with. Tip Most systems will have snmpwalk installed, but if necessary, you can load it yourself by running apt-get install snmp or yum install net-snmp-utils. Connectivity testing You can test connectivity to your SNMP devices with a basic test to gather the System Object Identifier (SysOID) of the device. If it's successful, the configuration of SNMP on the device and the network connectivity between the Docker host and the device are working well. If it fails, you'll need to validate the settings in your internal network. Run one of the following depending on your SNMP device version: SNMP v2c example bash Copy $ snmpwalk -v 2c -On -c $COMMUNITY $IP_ADDRESS .1.3.6.1.2.1.1.2.0 Where $COMMUNITY is your SNMP community string and $IP_ADDRESS is the target device IP. SNMP v3 example bash Copy $ snmpwalk -v 3 -l $LEVEL -u $USERNAME -a $AUTH_PROTOCOL -A $AUTH_PASSPHRASE -x $PRIV_PROTOCOL -X $PRIV_PASSPHRASE -ObentU -Cc $IP_ADDRESS .1.3.6.1.2.1.1.2.0 Replacing the following settings as necessary: bash Copy $ $LEVEL == noAuthNoPriv | authNoPriv | authPriv $ $USERNAME == SNMP v3 User $ $AUTH_PROTOCOL == MD5 | SHA $ $AUTH_PASSPHRASE == Authentication passphrase $ $PRIV_PROTOCOL == DES | AES $ $PRIV_PASSPHRASE == Privacy passphrase $ $IP_ADDRESS == target device IP The following is an example of the expected output after running snmpwalk: bash Copy $ .1.3.6.1.2.1.1.2.0 = OID: .1.3.6.1.4.1.9.1.46 Capturing full SNMP walk You may want to capture the output of walking every OID available on your devices. This output is used when creating new SNMP profiles for ktranslate, and it's a requirement to open a profile request on GitHub. The primary differences in your command for this are changing the target to a root ., and redirecting the output to a file that you can gather data from later. SNMP v2 example bash Copy $ snmpwalk -v 2c -On -c $COMMUNITY $IP_ADDRESS . >> snmpwalk.out SNMP v3 example bash Copy $ snmpwalk -v 3 -l $LEVEL -u $USERNAME -a $AUTH_PROTOCOL -A $AUTH_PASSPHRASE -x $PRIV_PROTOCOL -X $PRIV_PASSPHRASE -ObentU -Cc $IP_ADDRESS . >> snmpwalk.out The output of this command will be a file named snmpwalk.out, that lists every OID that the device responds to. Tip On devices with a large number of interfaces, this SNMP walk can take more than 10 minutes to complete.",

In your local machine, from a Linux host with Docker installed, download the ktranslate image from dockerhub by running bash Copy $ docker pull kentik/ktranslate:v2 Copy the snmp-base.yaml file to the local $HOME directory of your Docker user, and discard the container by running bash Copy $ cd . $ id=$(docker create kentik/ktranslate:v2) $ docker cp $id:/etc/ktranslate/snmp-base.yaml . $ docker rm -v $id In the snmp-base.yaml file, add your network flow devices inside the devices key with the following structure: devices: flowDevice: device_name: edge-router device_ip: 10.10.1.254 flow_only: true # Optional user tags user_tags: owning_team: net_eng environment: production Copy Tip If you're already monitoring SNMP data devices that send network flow data, you don't need to add them in your snmp-base.yaml file a second time. Run ktranslate to listen for network flows by running: bash Copy $ docker run -d --name ktranslate-sflow --restart unless-stopped --net=host \\ > -v `pwd`/snmp-base.yaml:/snmp-base.yaml \\ > -e NEW_RELIC_API_KEY=$YOUR_NR_LICENSE_KEY \\ > kentik/ktranslate:v2 \\ > -snmp /snmp-base.yaml \\ > -nr_account_id=$YOUR_NR_ACCOUNT_ID \\ > ## If your account is located in Europe, add the following flag: $ ## -nr_region=EU \\ $ ## If you want to use FedRAMP, add the following flag to use the FedRAMP authorized endpoints: $ ## -nr_region=GOV \\ $ -metrics=jchf \\ > -tee_logs=true \\ > -flow_only=true \\ > -nf.source=sflow \\ > -service_name=sflow \\ > nr1.flow Tip This command assumes collection of sflow data. If you are collecting other flow types, you should change the suffix in the --name flag for the container and update the -nf.source and -service_name flags as necessary.

      "body": "Problem You are having trouble collecting SNMP metrics from your device or you need to see what specific Object Identifiers (OIDs) your device supports. Solutions The snmpwalk utility is a useful tool for troubleshooting various SNMP challenges you may encounter. Because ktranslate runs on the host network of the Linux host that Docker is running on top of, it is an accurate measurement of whether or not your devices are responding to SNMP requests and what specifically they are responding with. Tip Most systems will have snmpwalk installed, but if necessary, you can load it yourself by running apt-get install snmp or yum install net-snmp-utils. Connectivity testing You can test connectivity to your SNMP devices with a basic test to gather the System Object Identifier (SysOID) of the device. If it's successful, the configuration of SNMP on the device and the network connectivity between the Docker host and the device are working well. If it fails, you'll need to validate the settings in your internal network. Run one of the following depending on your SNMP device version: SNMP v2c example bash Copy $ snmpwalk -v 2c -On -c $COMMUNITY $IP_ADDRESS .1.3.6.1.2.1.1.2.0 Where $COMMUNITY is your SNMP community string and $IP_ADDRESS is the target device IP. SNMP v3 example bash Copy $ snmpwalk -v 3 -l $LEVEL -u $USERNAME -a $AUTH_PROTOCOL -A $AUTH_PASSPHRASE -x $PRIV_PROTOCOL -X $PRIV_PASSPHRASE -ObentU -Cc $IP_ADDRESS .1.3.6.1.2.1.1.2.0 Replacing the following settings as necessary: bash Copy $ $LEVEL == noAuthNoPriv | authNoPriv | authPriv $ $USERNAME == SNMP v3 User $ $AUTH_PROTOCOL == MD5 | SHA $ $AUTH_PASSPHRASE == Authentication passphrase $ $PRIV_PROTOCOL == DES | AES $ $PRIV_PASSPHRASE == Privacy passphrase $ $IP_ADDRESS == target device IP The following is an example of the expected output after running snmpwalk: bash Copy $ .1.3.6.1.2.1.1.2.0 = OID: .1.3.6.1.4.1.9.1.46 Capturing full SNMP walk You may want to capture the output of walking every OID available on your devices. This output is used when creating new SNMP profiles for ktranslate, and it's a requirement to open a profile request on GitHub. The primary differences in your command for this are changing the target to a root ., and redirecting the output to a file that you can gather data from later. SNMP v2 example bash Copy $ snmpwalk -v 2c -On -c $COMMUNITY $IP_ADDRESS . >> snmpwalk.out SNMP v3 example bash Copy $ snmpwalk -v 3 -l $LEVEL -u $USERNAME -a $AUTH_PROTOCOL -A $AUTH_PASSPHRASE -x $PRIV_PROTOCOL -X $PRIV_PASSPHRASE -ObentU -Cc $IP_ADDRESS . >> snmpwalk.out The output of this command will be a file named snmpwalk.out, that lists every OID that the device responds to. Tip On devices with a large number of interfaces, this SNMP walk can take more than 10 minutes to complete.",

Tip It's recommended to set discovery.add_mibs: true to automate the addition of all discovered MIBs into the global.mibs_enabled attribute Launch a short-lived container to execute discovery by running bash Copy $ docker run -ti --name ktranslate-discovery --rm --net=host \\ > --user `id -u`:`id -g` \\ > -v `pwd`/snmp-base.yaml:/snmp-base.yaml \\ > kentik/ktranslate:v2 \\ > -snmp /snmp-base.yaml \\ > -log_level info \\ > -snmp_discovery=true After the discovery run finishes, you should see an output similar to the following: bash Copy $ >[Info] KTranslate Adding 3 new snmp devices to the config, 0 replaced from 3 $ # In this example, the discovery run found 3 new SNMP devices. The discovered devices are listed in the snmp-base.yaml file's devices.{} section. By default, only the IF-MIB mib is polled. You can manually add other mibs to the global.mibs_enabled attribute if you did not set discovery.add_mibs: true before running the discovery.

      "body": "Problem You are having trouble collecting SNMP metrics from your device or you need to see what specific Object Identifiers (OIDs) your device supports. Solutions The snmpwalk utility is a useful tool for troubleshooting various SNMP challenges you may encounter. Because ktranslate runs on the host network of the Linux host that Docker is running on top of, it is an accurate measurement of whether or not your devices are responding to SNMP requests and what specifically they are responding with. Tip Most systems will have snmpwalk installed, but if necessary, you can load it yourself by running apt-get install snmp or yum install net-snmp-utils. Connectivity testing You can test connectivity to your SNMP devices with a basic test to gather the System Object Identifier (SysOID) of the device. If it's successful, the configuration of SNMP on the device and the network connectivity between the Docker host and the device are working well. If it fails, you'll need to validate the settings in your internal network. Run one of the following depending on your SNMP device version: SNMP v2c example bash Copy $ snmpwalk -v 2c -On -c $COMMUNITY $IP_ADDRESS .1.3.6.1.2.1.1.2.0 Where $COMMUNITY is your SNMP community string and $IP_ADDRESS is the target device IP. SNMP v3 example bash Copy $ snmpwalk -v 3 -l $LEVEL -u $USERNAME -a $AUTH_PROTOCOL -A $AUTH_PASSPHRASE -x $PRIV_PROTOCOL -X $PRIV_PASSPHRASE -ObentU -Cc $IP_ADDRESS .1.3.6.1.2.1.1.2.0 Replacing the following settings as necessary: bash Copy $ $LEVEL == noAuthNoPriv | authNoPriv | authPriv $ $USERNAME == SNMP v3 User $ $AUTH_PROTOCOL == MD5 | SHA $ $AUTH_PASSPHRASE == Authentication passphrase $ $PRIV_PROTOCOL == DES | AES $ $PRIV_PASSPHRASE == Privacy passphrase $ $IP_ADDRESS == target device IP The following is an example of the expected output after running snmpwalk: bash Copy $ .1.3.6.1.2.1.1.2.0 = OID: .1.3.6.1.4.1.9.1.46 Capturing full SNMP walk You may want to capture the output of walking every OID available on your devices. This output is used when creating new SNMP profiles for ktranslate, and it's a requirement to open a profile request on GitHub. The primary differences in your command for this are changing the target to a root ., and redirecting the output to a file that you can gather data from later. SNMP v2 example bash Copy $ snmpwalk -v 2c -On -c $COMMUNITY $IP_ADDRESS . >> snmpwalk.out SNMP v3 example bash Copy $ snmpwalk -v 3 -l $LEVEL -u $USERNAME -a $AUTH_PROTOCOL -A $AUTH_PASSPHRASE -x $PRIV_PROTOCOL -X $PRIV_PASSPHRASE -ObentU -Cc $IP_ADDRESS . >> snmpwalk.out The output of this command will be a file named snmpwalk.out, that lists every OID that the device responds to. Tip On devices with a large number of interfaces, this SNMP walk can take more than 10 minutes to complete.",

In your local machine, from a Linux host with Docker installed, download the ktranslate image from dockerhub by running bash Copy $ docker pull kentik/ktranslate:v2 Copy the snmp-base.yaml file to the local $HOME directory of your Docker user, and discard the container by running bash Copy $ cd . $ id=$(docker create kentik/ktranslate:v2) $ docker cp $id:/etc/ktranslate/snmp-base.yaml . $ docker rm -v $id In the snmp-base.yaml file, add your network flow devices inside the devices key with the following structure: devices: flowDevice: device_name: edge-router device_ip: 10.10.1.254 flow_only: true # Optional user tags user_tags: owning_team: net_eng environment: production Copy Tip If you're already monitoring SNMP data devices that send network flow data, you don't need to add them in your snmp-base.yaml file a second time. Run ktranslate to listen for network flows by running: bash Copy $ docker run -d --name ktranslate-sflow --restart unless-stopped --net=host \\ > -v `pwd`/snmp-base.yaml:/snmp-base.yaml \\ > -e NEW_RELIC_API_KEY=$YOUR_NR_LICENSE_KEY \\ > kentik/ktranslate:v2 \\ > -snmp /snmp-base.yaml \\ > -nr_account_id=$YOUR_NR_ACCOUNT_ID \\ > ## If your account is located in Europe, add the following flag: $ ## -nr_region=EU \\ $ ## If you want to use FedRAMP, add the following flag to use the FedRAMP authorized endpoints: $ ## -nr_region=GOV \\ $ -metrics=jchf \\ > -tee_logs=true \\ > -flow_only=true \\ > -nf.source=sflow \\ > -service_name=sflow \\ > nr1.flow Tip This command assumes collection of sflow data. If you are collecting other flow types, you should change the suffix in the --name flag for the container and update the -nf.source and -service_name flags as necessary. To get better visibility into your network device performance, set up SNMP data monitoring. To get insights into system messages from your devices, setup network syslog collection.

      "body": "BETA FEATURE This feature is currently in open beta and still in development, but we encourage you to try it out! Set up your AWS VPC flow logs to send them to New Relic One. Prerequisites New Relic One account prerequisites A New Relic account. Don't have one? Sign up for free! No credit card required. A New Relic account ID. Read how to find your account ID. A New Relic license key. Read how to generate a new License key. AWS prerequisites AWS VPC Flow Export configured to existing S3 bucket. Permissions to build and publish images to Amazon ECR. Permissions to create a Lambda function. AWS CLI (v 1.9.15+) installed. Docker installed. Required fields from VPC flow logs Important The default format for flow logs does not include all of the required fields that are required for ktranslate to work properly. You must ensure that the below fields are added or the data you'll receive in New Relic One will be incomplete. Flow Record Field Description version The VPC Flow Logs version. srcaddr The source address for incoming traffic, or the IPv4 or IPv6 address of the network interface for outgoing traffic. For a network interface, the IPv4 address is always its private IPv4 address. dstaddr The destination address for outgoing traffic, or the IPv4 or IPv6 address of the network interface for incoming traffic. For a network interface, the IPv4 address is always its private IPv4 address. srcport The source port of the traffic. dstport The destination port of the traffic. protocol The IANA protocol number of the traffic. packets The number of packets transferred during the flow. bytes The number of bytes transferred during the flow. vpc-id The ID of the VPC that contains the network interface for which the traffic is recorded. flow-direction The direction of the flow with respect to the interface where traffic is captured. The possible values are ingress and egress. Set up AWS VPC flow logs monitoring in New Relic One To send your VPC flow logs to New Relic One, follow these steps: Create a private ECR registry and upload the ktranslate image Create a Lambda function from the ECR image Validate your settings 1. Create a private ECR registry and upload the ktranslate image Authenticate to your registry by running: bash Copy $ aws ecr get-login-password --region $AWS_ACCOUNT_REGION | docker login --username AWS --password-stdin $AWS_ACCOUNT_ID.dkr.ecr.$AWS_ACCOUNT_REGION.amazonaws.com Create a repository to hold the ktranslate image by running: bash Copy $ aws ecr create-repository --repository-name ktranslate --image-scanning-configuration scanOnPush=true --region $AWS_ACCOUNT_REGION Pull the ktranslate image from Docker Hub by running: bash Copy $ docker pull kentik/ktranslate:v2 Tag the image to push to your docker repository by running: bash Copy $ docker tag kentik/ktranslate:v2 $AWS_ACCOUNT_ID.dkr.ecr.$AWS_ACCOUNT_REGION.amazonaws.com/ktranslate:v2 Push the image to your docker repository by running: bash Copy $ docker push $AWS_ACCOUNT_ID.dkr.ecr.$AWS_ACCOUNT_REGION.amazonaws.com/ktranslate:v2 After running these steps, you should see an output similar to the following: bash Copy $ The push refers to repository [$AWS_ACCOUNT_ID.dkr.ecr.$AWS_ACCOUNT_REGION.amazonaws.com/ktranslate] $ 870d899ac0b0: Pushed $ 0a4768abd477: Pushed $ b206b92a2843: Pushed $ 22abafd3e6c9: Pushed $ 1335c3725252: Pushed $ 7188c9350e77: Pushed $ 2b75f71baacd: Pushed $ ba50c5652654: Pushed $ 80bbd31930ea: Pushed $ c3d2a28a326e: Pushed $ 1a058d5342cc: Pushed $ v2: digest: sha256:4cfe36919ae954063203a80f69ca1795280117c44947a09d678b4842bb8e4dd2 size: 2624 2. Create a Lambda function from the ECR image The Lambda function you create must reside in the same AWS Region as the S3 bucket where you store your VPC flow logs. To create a Lambda function defined as a container image, follow the following steps: Navigate to the Lambda service in your AWS console and select Create function. Select the Container image tile at the top of the screen, and: Name your function. Click Browse Images and choose the ktranslate image with the v2 tag you pushed to ECR. Keep the architecture on x86_64, accept the default permissions, and click Create function. On the landing page for your new function, select the Configuration tab, and: In General configuration, change the timeout value to 0 min 20 sec. In the Permissions section, click Execution role for your function, which will open a new tab for IAM. On the Permissions tab, select Attach policies and add the AmazonS3ReadOnlyAccess to grant your function access to the S3 bucket your VPC flow logs are in. Back on your function's landing page, in the Environment variables section, click Edit and add the Lambda environment variables. On the Triggers section, click Add trigger, and: Select the S3 type. Select the bucket where you store your VPC Flow Logs. Choose the All object create events event type. Optionally, if your bucket has a custom folder in the root directory outside the AWSLogs directory, you can add it in the Prefix section. Accept the Recursive Invocation warning and click Add. At this point, your Lambda function is deployed and listening for new events on your S3 bucket. 3. Validate your settings Tip It can take several minutes for data to first appear in your account as the export of VPC flow logs to S3 usually runs on a 5-minute cycle. To confirm your Lambda function is working as expected, do one of the following: Go to one.newrelic.com > Explorer and you will begin to see VPC Network entities. You can click them and investigate the various metrics each one is sending. Go to one.newrelic.com > Query your data and to get a quick summary of the recent VPCs that you have flow logs from, run the following NRQL query: FROM KFlow SELECT count(*) FACET device_name WHERE provider = 'kentik-vpc' Copy In your AWS Console, click the Monitor tab in your function's landing page, where you can track important metrics like invocation, error count, and success rate. You can also investigate the error logs from recent invocations. Tip We recommend you to add serverless monitoring from New Relic One to your new Lambda function. This way, you'll proactively monitor the health of the function and get alerts in case of problems. Find and use your metrics All VPC flow logs exported from the ktranslate Lambda function use the KFlow namespace, via the New Relic Event API. Currently, these are the fields populated from this integration: Attribute Type Description application String The class of program generating the traffic in this flow record. This is derived from the lowest numeric value from l4_dst_port and l4_src_port. Common examples include http, ssh, and ftp. dest_vpc String The name of the VPC the traffic in this flow record is targeting, if known. device_name String The name of the VPC this flow record was exported from. dst_addr String The target IPv4 address for this flow record. dst_as Numeric The target Autonomous System Number for this flow record. dst_as_name String The target Autonomous System Name for this flow record. dst_endpoint String The target IP:Port tuple for this flow record. This is a combination of dst_addr and l4_dst_port. dst_geo String The target country for this flow record, if known. flow_direction String The direction of flow for this record, from the point of view of the interface where the traffic was captured. Valid options are ingress | egress. in_bytes Numeric The number of bytes transferred for ingress flow records. in_pkts Numeric The number of packets transferred for ingress flow records. l4_dst_port Numeric The target port for this flow record. l4_src_port Numeric The source port for this flow record. out_bytes Numeric The number of bytes transferred for egress flow records. out_pkts Numeric The number of packets transferred for egress flow records. protocol String The display name of the protocol used in this flow record, derived from the numeric IANA protocol number provider String This attribute is used to uniquely identify various sources of data from ktranslate. VPC flow logs will always have the value of kentik-vpc. sample_rate Numeric The rate at which ktranslate samples from the various files in the S3 bucket for flow exports. (Default: 1000) This can be configured with the KENTIK_SAMPLE_RATE environment variable. source_vpc String The name of the VPC the traffic in this flow record originated from, if known. src_addr String The source IPv4 address for this flow record. src_as Numeric The source Autonomous System Number for this flow record. src_as_name String The source Autonomous System Name for this flow record. src_endpoint String The source IP:Port tuple for this flow record. This is a combination of src_addr and l4_src_port. src_geo String The source country for this flow record, if known. start_time Numeric The time, in Unix seconds, when the first packet of the flow was received within the aggregation interval. This might be up to 60 seconds after the packet was transmitted or received on the network interface. timestamp Numeric The time, in Unix seconds, when this flow record was received by the New Relic Event API. Environment variables for AWS Lambda functions When you're configuring your AWS Lambda function, you need to set up the following environment variables: Key Value Required KENTIK_MODE nr1.vpc.lambda √ NEW_RELIC_API_KEY The New Relic license key for your account √ NR_ACCOUNT_ID Your New Relic account ID √ NR_REGION The New Relic datacenter region for your account. The possible values are US and EU, and by default it's set to US. KENTIK_SAMPLE_RATE The rate of randomized sampling ktranslate applies to the flow export objects in S3. By default, it's set to 1000. Setting this to 1 disables all sampling and ktranslate ships all flow records to New Relic One. Tip For S3 objects with less than 100 flow records, ktranslate will revert to a sample rate of 1 and process every record. For S3 objects with more than 100 flow records, ktranslate will use the configured value of KENTIK_SAMPLE_RATE, which has a default of 1000. Meaning that every record in the object has a 1:1000 change of being sampled.",

      "body": "There may be cases where an application sends many individual metrics that could be better managed in groups. Most of these occur with web transactions metrics named from URLs. For more information on this issue, see Metric grouping issues (MGIs). To reduce high cardinality and prevent metric grouping issues, New Relic supports rules for grouping or filtering out metrics (normalization). In some cases, when MGIs with a significant high number of metrics are detected, a rule is created automatically to protect the platform from performance degradation. Metric normalization rules management You can create and manage new rules that deal with the noise produced from high cardinality metrics by using the metric normalization tool, which is accessible from each service dashboard in the New Relic Explorer. Once there, select Metric Normalization in the left sidebar. There you can see the existing rules or create new ones. Click a rule to modify it, or click Create a new rule to create a new one. A new pane to configure the rule will be displayed. Available fields are: Match expression: enter the regular expression to group all the metrics you want to include in the rule. Matches: here you will see a preview of the metrics matched by the regular expression above. Action: the action you want to perform on the metrics. Replace: replace the matched metrics by the regular expression with the value described in the Replacement field. Ignore: ignore any metric that matches the regular expression. Deny new metrics: only write metrics that have already been reported, and ignore those that match the regular expression. Replacement: only active when Replace is enabled. Matched metrics are replaced with the field's value. If the regular expression is capturing groups, you can use placeholders for them with \\1 or \\2 for the groups 1 and 2 respectively. Active: rules can’t be deleted, but can be deactivated. Click the toggle to enable or disable the rule. If you want the rule to be removed, reach out to New Relic's support. Terminate: When enabled, the rules waterfall is exited when the associated pattern is matched. Notes: internal notes on the rule. Has no effect on the rule. Once you have set up the fields, click Create (or Edit in case you are editing an existing rule), and the rule will be applied immediately as long as it's Active.",

      "body": "In the software industry, a tag typically refers to a piece of metadata added to a data set for the purpose of improving data organization and findability. At New Relic, our tags are key:value pairs (like team: operations) added to various sets of data, like monitored apps and hosts, agents, dashboards, and workloads. We make some important attributes available as tags (for example, app metadata like app name and language, and host metadata like host name and AWS region). You can also add your own custom tags. You can use tags in the UI to filter down to relevant data. Here is an example: Here you can see an accountId tag being used to filter workloads to a specific account. Tags help you to: Organize data coming from a large number of sources and/or to a large number of New Relic accounts. Identify teams, roles, environments, or regions to know who’s responsible for what (see example use cases). Better organize and search dashboards and workloads. Query and chart APM data. Tags are useful for organizing data at a high level. If you want to add more fine-grained detail, like capturing user names or other high-cardinality values, custom attributes or custom events are a better solution. Tip Tags were previously called labels in the New Relic UI. You may sometimes see labelin our code; for example, some of our APM agent config files use a label config option for tags. Tag format and limits Format requirements and limits for tags: The UI has limits on the total number of tags it can display per entity: Limit of 100 for tags reported by default or added via agent/integration configuration. Limit of 100 for custom tags added via UI or API. The following are maximum character length for tags: Key: 128 characters Value: 256 characters When using our API to add tags, a dash (-) in a tag key is interpreted as a minus symbol. If your tag key has a dash, use back ticks around it (like `key-name`). Best practices and tips Before adding tags, we recommend first seeing how our default tags work for you. When you're ready to add your own tags, review the following best practices tips to get the most out of them. Tips on keeping tags simple: Start by adding only tags you know you’ll definitely use. Unused tags create noise and may add confusion. Try to use short tags. Shorter tags are easier to parse, and also the UI may sometimes truncate longer tags. (See character limits.) When possible, use keys and values that are human-readable (for example, region: EMEA is better than Param8323 : 1229072). Avoid including several values like regions: EMEA | US | LATAM in a single tag. We recommend using three different tags for that, like region: emea, region: us, and region: latam. If you want to match multiple tags, you can do that using the advanced options in the filter UI. Tips on using tags consistently: Try to be consistent with tag language across your teams and entities. Be consistent with naming. For example, avoid using both region: emea and reg: emea. Be consistent with format. For example, avoid using both camelCase and kebab-case. Although tag searching is not case-sensitive in the UI and API, try to be consistent with capitalization. For example, avoid using both env: staging and env: Staging. Tips on cross-team implementation: Tags help improve observability and cost allocation. For this reason, responsibility for tag implementation is often assigned to an observability team, SREs, a group of architects, or a cross-team task force. We recommend the people responsible for implementing tags meet and create an internal policy to describe how the tags are defined and which conventions are to be used. Then: Keep this reference manual up to date. Automate the definition of tags when you deploy New Relic agents, at the cloud provider, or through New Relic automation tools, such as the API or Terraform. Create recurring reports that identify entities that are non-compliant with your tagging standards. Tag examples Here are some examples of common ways to use tags to organize data: Team-related tags Creating tags for team names can be helpful to understand which team, group, department, or region was responsible for a change that led to a performance issue. Team examples: team: backend team: frontend team: db Role examples: roles: architecture roles: devops roles: pm Region examples: region: emea region: america region: asia Environment-related tags You can create entities for the environment they belong to. Examples: env: production env: qa env: development env: staging Criticality-related tags You can create tags related to criticality levels, which lets you easier track the most critical issues. Examples: layer: level1 layer: level2 layer: level3 How tags are added Some important attributes, by default, are available for use as tags. For example, the account name, the account ID, and some basic host/server metadata are available as default tags. You can't remove these available-by-default tags. Here are some details about how tags are added for some specific data sources: Add tags via UI or API When you add tags via the UI or API, this occurs at the entity level. This means that, for example, if you have multiple APM agents monitoring a single entity and apply a tag via the UI, that tag is available for all data coming from that entity. To add or delete tags via the UI: Select a monitored entity, like a monitored app or host. Near the entity’s name at the top of the page, select the See metadata and manage tags menu. In the menu that pops up, add or delete a tag. For APM agents, restart your service. To manage tags via API: see our NerdGraph tagging docs. For a guide to using our CLI to automate tagging, see our developer site. APM agent tags You can add tags via the UI and API or you can add tags using APM agent configuration, both methods require you to restart your service. There are differences in how these apply tags: Via agent config: These tags are applied at the agent-level, not the entity/application level. This would be a good option if you have multiple agents monitoring different aspects of the same app (for example, a blue-green deployment model). Via the UI or API: These tags are applied at the entity/application level. Here are links to the agent configuration options: C SDK: not available Java Go .NET Node.js PHP Python Ruby For information on querying APM tags, see Query APM tags. And check out this short video on querying APM tags (3:20 minutes). Infrastructure data tags There are several ways tags are added to infrastructure entities and services: Use the UI or API to add tags at the entity level. Infrastructure agent: some attributes are available by default as tags. You can also add custom attributes, which are also available as tags in the UI. On-host integrations: some attributes are available by default as tags. You can also add tags by using integration-specific labels config options (for an example, see the labels config for the Apache integration). Cloud service integrations: by default we report tags and labels that are defined in the cloud service. To add tags, you'd add them on the cloud-service-side. Automate tags with our CLI For a guide to automating tags using our CLI tool, see our developer site. Use tags to filter the UI Use the filter field at the top of the New Relic Explorer to filter down to the entities you care about. You can use multiple filter conditions. To filter down to certain entities using tags: From one.newrelic.com, click Explorer. Click the Filter by... field to see a dropdown of available attributes and tags. You can filter by multiple elements and use advanced search options. To find an entity’s metadata and tags from the UI, here are two options: From a list of entities in the UI, at the far right, select an entity's icon. OR Select an entity. Near the top of the page, select the icon. To use the API to view tags, see our NerdGraph docs. Learn about how to use tags with dashboards and how to use tags with workloads. Custom queries, charts, and alerts Different features handle tags differently. Here are some details about how you can use NRQL to query tag data, or create NRQL condition alerts. Query and alert on APM tags You can query APM tags using NRQL. Minimum agent versions: C: not available Go: 2.3.0 Java: 4.9.0 .NET: 8.17 Node: v4.13.0 PHP: not available Python: v4.10.0.112 Ruby: 6.1.0.352 Here are some query examples: Throughput across shards Given a service that is distributed across nine shards, each shard assigned as an environment, we can plot the transaction throughput on all shards using a wildcard query like: SELECT rate(count(apm.service.transaction.duration), 1 minute) FROM Metric WHERE appName LIKE 'MyApp (%' AND transactionType = 'Other' FACET tags.Environment TIMESERIES Copy Transactions per team To see the number of transactions per service for a specific team, we might use a query like: FROM Transaction SELECT count(*) WHERE tags.Team = 'team-a' FACET tags.Project TIMESERIES Copy Alert on error rate for teams You can use a query for your services’ error rate for setting an alert without having to create a rule for each service. Here is the error rate for all services on a team called team-b. And this alert will automatically monitor any new app names added with the team tag. FROM Metric SELECT count(apm.service.error.count) / count(apm.service.transaction.duration) WHERE tags.Team = 'team-b' FACET appName Copy Related to this, you might create a general rule for a specific service deployed across several environments, so that we have an alarm for a single service monitoring each environment individually: From Metric SELECT count(apm.service.error.count) / count(apm.service.transaction.duration) WHERE tags.Project = 'MyProject' FACET tags.Environment Copy Query and alert on attributes As explained in the tag sources information, some important attributes are used as tags. You can query all attributes and create custom charts using NRQL, and create NRQL alert conditions.",

Starting out with NerdGraph If you're new to NerdGraph and GraphQL, you may want to first read our Introduction to NerdGraph. If you’re already familiar with the dashboards API, you can read Create dashboards with NerdGraph. When using NerdGraph, it helps to understand that our dashboards are entities that report data from other entities, such as monitored apps, hosts and services. Find the NerdGraph API explorer at api.newrelic.com/graphiql. Operations We have defined a granular GraphQL API that lets you execute different dashboard operations depending on their goal and scope. Dashboard CRUD operations Operation GraphQL operation type Notes actor > entity() query Get dashboard operation. You can get all dashboard and widget data for a given dashboard entity GUID. dashboardCreate() mutation Create dashboard operation. You can create a dashboard attached to a specific account by specifying all its elements, from metadata to widget configuration. dashboardUpdate() mutation Update dashboard operation. You can update an existing dashboard given a dashboard entity GUID. You need to specify the complete, updated dashboard elements, from metadata to widget configuration. dashboardDelete() mutation Delete dashboard operation. You can delete an existing dashboard given a dashboard entity GUID. This operation executes a logical delete that lets you recover your dashboard. dashboardUndelete() mutation Undelete dashboard operation. You can recover a previously deleted dashboard given a dashboard entity GUID. Dashboard page operations Operation GraphQL operation type Notes dashboardUpdatePage() mutation Update dashboard page operation. You can update one page of an existing dashboard given a dashboard page entity GUID. You need to specify the complete, updated dashboard page elements, from metadata to widget configuration. dashboardUpdateWidgetsInPage() mutation Update widgets operation. You can update a set of existing widgets of a dashboard page given a dashboard page entity GUID. You need to specify the set of widgets to be updated and their complete configuration. dashboardAddWidgetsToPage() mutation Add widgets operation. You can add a set of new widgets to a dashboard page given a dashboard page entity GUID. You need to specify the set of new widgets and their complete configuration. Other operations Operation GraphQL operation type Notes dashboardCreateSnapshotUrl() mutation Create dashboard page snapshot operation. You can create a public URL for a given dashboard page entity GUID. The dashboard page can then be accessed in the form of a static snapshot in the resulting public URL. actor > dashboard > liveUrls() query List all live URLs operation. You can get the complete list of live URLs you have access to. A live URL is a mechanism that allows you to share dashboard pages and widgets publicly with up-to-date or live data. dashboardWidgetRevokeLiveUrl() mutation Revoke widget live URL operation. You can revoke a previously created live URL of a widget. As a result, the live URL will become unavailable to the public. Limits We have limited the values you can set to some of the dashboard properties. This allows us to keep dashboards in good shape while boosting their usability. Dashboard limits Limit Value Maximum number of pages in a dashboard 20 Maximum length of a dashboard name 255 Maximum length of a dashboard description 1024 Dashboard page limits Limit Value Maximum number of widgets in a dashboard page 100 Maximum length of a dashboard page name 255 Maximum length of a dashboard page description 1024 Widget limits Limit Value Maximum length of a widget title 255 Maximum number of entities linked to a widget 1 Maximum number of queries in a widget 20 Maximum layout column of a widget 12 Minimum layout column of a widget 1 Minimum layout row of a widget 1 Maximum layout width of a widget 12 Minimum layout width of a widget 1 Maximum layout height of a widget 32 Minimum layout height of a widget 1 Errors as first class citizens All dashboard mutations offer a way to ask for errors when being executed.

      "body": "NerdGraph is our GraphQL-format API that lets you query New Relic data and configure some New Relic features. After you sign up for a free New Relic account and install any of our monitoring services, you can get started with NerdGraph. What is NerdGraph? New Relic has several APIs. NerdGraph is the API we recommend for querying New Relic data and for performing some specific configurations (learn more about features). NerdGraph provides a single API interface for returning data from New Relic’s various APIs and microservices. Over time, other configuration capabilities will be added to NerdGraph. Important NerdGraph isn’t used for data ingest. For that, you'd use our data ingest APIs. NerdGraph is built using GraphQL, which is an open source API format that allows you to request exactly the data needed, with no over-fetching or under-fetching. For a lesson in how to use NerdGraph, watch this 7-minute video: Want to watch more video tutorials? Go to the New Relic University’s Intro to NerdGraph. Or see the online course on New Relic APIs. Use the GraphiQL explorer To get started using GraphQL, we recommend playing around with our GraphiQL explorer (GraphiQL is an open source graphical interface for using GraphQL). You can use it to explore our data schema, to read built-in object definitions, and to build and execute queries. To use GraphQL, you’ll need a user-specific New Relic API key called a user key. You can generate one or find an existing one from the GraphiQL explorer’s API key dropdown. To find the GraphiQL explorer: If your New Relic account uses an EU data center, go to api.eu.newrelic.com/graphiql. Otherwise use api.newrelic.com/graphiql. For tips on how to build queries, see Build queries. Requirements and endpoints To use NerdGraph, you need a New Relic user key, which can be generated and accessed from the GraphiQL explorer. The endpoints are: Main endpoint: https://api.newrelic.com/graphql Endpoint for accounts using EU data center: https://api.eu.newrelic.com/graphql To access the endpoint, use the following cURL command: curl -X POST https://api.newrelic.com/graphql \\ -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \\ -H 'API-Key: YOUR_NEW_RELIC_USER_KEY' \\ -d '{ \"query\": \"{ requestContext { userId apiKey } }\" } ' Copy What can you do with NerdGraph? NerdGraph functionality can be broken down into two main categories: Querying New Relic data. You can fetch data for a variety of purposes, including using it in a programmatic workflow, or building a New Relic One app for custom data visualizations. Configuring New Relic features. There are a variety of configurations available and more will be added over time. You can do things like add tags, configure workloads, or customize \"golden metrics.\" You can use NerdGraph to return a wide range of New Relic data but we’ve created some tutorials for common use cases: Topic Tutorials Your monitored entities Get data about entities Understand entity relationships and dependencies (used to build service maps) Query and configure \"golden metrics\" (important entity metrics) Querying data Query using NRQL (our query language) Tags Add and manage tags Dashboards Create dashboards Export dashboards to other accounts Export dashboards as files Migrate from Insights Dashboard API to NerdGraph Alerts See all alert-related tutorials Applied Intelligence View and configure topology Workloads View and configure workloads Service Levels Configure and manage Service Levels Manage keys Create and manage keys (license keys used for data ingest, and user keys) Manage data Convert event data to metric data Drop data Distributed tracing Query distributed tracing data Configure Infinite Tracing New Relic One apps Build a New Relic One app Cloud integrations (AWS, Azure, GCP) Configure cloud integrations Partners and resellers Manage subscriptions (only for partners using original pricing model) Data partitions Manage data partitions Date retention Manage data retention NerdGraph terminology The following are terms that originate with GraphQL (the API format NerdGraph uses). Term Definition Queries and mutations There are two classes of GraphQL operations: Queries are basic requests used only to fetch data. These queries are not static, meaning that you can ask for more data or less data, depending on your needs. For each query, you can specify exactly what data you want to retrieve, as long as it is supported by the schema. Mutations are requests that perform an action, such as creating a resource or changing configuration. Mutations require the keyword mutation, as well as the name of the mutation. Type Data in GraphQL is organized into types. Types can be scalars (like strings, numbers, or booleans) or object types. An object type is a custom type made up of a collection of fields. For example, an object type called User may represent a user in a system. Field A field represents a piece of information on an object type that can be queried. Fields can be scalars, lists, or objects. For example, a User object type could have a string field called name. Interface An interface is an abstract type that represents a collection of common fields that other object types can implement. Tips on using the GraphiQL explorer You can make queries with the NerdGraph GraphiQL explorer. The explorer provides built-in schema definitions and features, including auto-complete and query validation. Query accounts a New Relic user can access You can query for the name of an account that an actor (a New Relic authorized user) has access to: query { actor { account(id: YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID) { name } } } Copy The response will mirror the query structure you defined in the request, making it easy to ask for the specific data that you want. { \"data\": { \"actor\": { \"account\": { \"name\": \"Data Nerd\" } } } } Copy Query user, account, and NRQL in one request The graph structure shows its capabilities when queries become more complex. For example, you can query for user information, account information, and make a NRQL query with one request. With REST API, this would take three different requests to three different endpoints. query { actor { account(id: YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID) { name nrql(query: \"SELECT * FROM Transaction\") { results } } user { name id } } } Copy",

      "body": "In the software industry, a tag typically refers to a piece of metadata added to a data set for the purpose of improving data organization and findability. At New Relic, our tags are key:value pairs (like team: operations) added to various sets of data, like monitored apps and hosts, agents, dashboards, and workloads. We make some important attributes available as tags (for example, app metadata like app name and language, and host metadata like host name and AWS region). You can also add your own custom tags. You can use tags in the UI to filter down to relevant data. Here is an example: Here you can see an accountId tag being used to filter workloads to a specific account. Tags help you to: Organize data coming from a large number of sources and/or to a large number of New Relic accounts. Identify teams, roles, environments, or regions to know who’s responsible for what (see example use cases). Better organize and search dashboards and workloads. Query and chart APM data. Tags are useful for organizing data at a high level. If you want to add more fine-grained detail, like capturing user names or other high-cardinality values, custom attributes or custom events are a better solution. Tip Tags were previously called labels in the New Relic UI. You may sometimes see labelin our code; for example, some of our APM agent config files use a label config option for tags. Tag format and limits Format requirements and limits for tags: The UI has limits on the total number of tags it can display per entity: Limit of 100 for tags reported by default or added via agent/integration configuration. Limit of 100 for custom tags added via UI or API. The following are maximum character length for tags: Key: 128 characters Value: 256 characters When using our API to add tags, a dash (-) in a tag key is interpreted as a minus symbol. If your tag key has a dash, use back ticks around it (like `key-name`). Best practices and tips Before adding tags, we recommend first seeing how our default tags work for you. When you're ready to add your own tags, review the following best practices tips to get the most out of them. Tips on keeping tags simple: Start by adding only tags you know you’ll definitely use. Unused tags create noise and may add confusion. Try to use short tags. Shorter tags are easier to parse, and also the UI may sometimes truncate longer tags. (See character limits.) When possible, use keys and values that are human-readable (for example, region: EMEA is better than Param8323 : 1229072). Avoid including several values like regions: EMEA | US | LATAM in a single tag. We recommend using three different tags for that, like region: emea, region: us, and region: latam. If you want to match multiple tags, you can do that using the advanced options in the filter UI. Tips on using tags consistently: Try to be consistent with tag language across your teams and entities. Be consistent with naming. For example, avoid using both region: emea and reg: emea. Be consistent with format. For example, avoid using both camelCase and kebab-case. Although tag searching is not case-sensitive in the UI and API, try to be consistent with capitalization. For example, avoid using both env: staging and env: Staging. Tips on cross-team implementation: Tags help improve observability and cost allocation. For this reason, responsibility for tag implementation is often assigned to an observability team, SREs, a group of architects, or a cross-team task force. We recommend the people responsible for implementing tags meet and create an internal policy to describe how the tags are defined and which conventions are to be used. Then: Keep this reference manual up to date. Automate the definition of tags when you deploy New Relic agents, at the cloud provider, or through New Relic automation tools, such as the API or Terraform. Create recurring reports that identify entities that are non-compliant with your tagging standards. Tag examples Here are some examples of common ways to use tags to organize data: Team-related tags Creating tags for team names can be helpful to understand which team, group, department, or region was responsible for a change that led to a performance issue. Team examples: team: backend team: frontend team: db Role examples: roles: architecture roles: devops roles: pm Region examples: region: emea region: america region: asia Environment-related tags You can create entities for the environment they belong to. Examples: env: production env: qa env: development env: staging Criticality-related tags You can create tags related to criticality levels, which lets you easier track the most critical issues. Examples: layer: level1 layer: level2 layer: level3 How tags are added Some important attributes, by default, are available for use as tags. For example, the account name, the account ID, and some basic host/server metadata are available as default tags. You can't remove these available-by-default tags. Here are some details about how tags are added for some specific data sources: Add tags via UI or API When you add tags via the UI or API, this occurs at the entity level. This means that, for example, if you have multiple APM agents monitoring a single entity and apply a tag via the UI, that tag is available for all data coming from that entity. To add or delete tags via the UI: Select a monitored entity, like a monitored app or host. Near the entity’s name at the top of the page, select the See metadata and manage tags menu. In the menu that pops up, add or delete a tag. For APM agents, restart your service. To manage tags via API: see our NerdGraph tagging docs. For a guide to using our CLI to automate tagging, see our developer site. APM agent tags You can add tags via the UI and API or you can add tags using APM agent configuration, both methods require you to restart your service. There are differences in how these apply tags: Via agent config: These tags are applied at the agent-level, not the entity/application level. This would be a good option if you have multiple agents monitoring different aspects of the same app (for example, a blue-green deployment model). Via the UI or API: These tags are applied at the entity/application level. Here are links to the agent configuration options: C SDK: not available Java Go .NET Node.js PHP Python Ruby For information on querying APM tags, see Query APM tags. And check out this short video on querying APM tags (3:20 minutes). Infrastructure data tags There are several ways tags are added to infrastructure entities and services: Use the UI or API to add tags at the entity level. Infrastructure agent: some attributes are available by default as tags. You can also add custom attributes, which are also available as tags in the UI. On-host integrations: some attributes are available by default as tags. You can also add tags by using integration-specific labels config options (for an example, see the labels config for the Apache integration). Cloud service integrations: by default we report tags and labels that are defined in the cloud service. To add tags, you'd add them on the cloud-service-side. Automate tags with our CLI For a guide to automating tags using our CLI tool, see our developer site. Use tags to filter the UI Use the filter field at the top of the New Relic Explorer to filter down to the entities you care about. You can use multiple filter conditions. To filter down to certain entities using tags: From one.newrelic.com, click Explorer. Click the Filter by... field to see a dropdown of available attributes and tags. You can filter by multiple elements and use advanced search options. To find an entity’s metadata and tags from the UI, here are two options: From a list of entities in the UI, at the far right, select an entity's icon. OR Select an entity. Near the top of the page, select the icon. To use the API to view tags, see our NerdGraph docs. Learn about how to use tags with dashboards and how to use tags with workloads. Custom queries, charts, and alerts Different features handle tags differently. Here are some details about how you can use NRQL to query tag data, or create NRQL condition alerts. Query and alert on APM tags You can query APM tags using NRQL. Minimum agent versions: C: not available Go: 2.3.0 Java: 4.9.0 .NET: 8.17 Node: v4.13.0 PHP: not available Python: v4.10.0.112 Ruby: 6.1.0.352 Here are some query examples: Throughput across shards Given a service that is distributed across nine shards, each shard assigned as an environment, we can plot the transaction throughput on all shards using a wildcard query like: SELECT rate(count(apm.service.transaction.duration), 1 minute) FROM Metric WHERE appName LIKE 'MyApp (%' AND transactionType = 'Other' FACET tags.Environment TIMESERIES Copy Transactions per team To see the number of transactions per service for a specific team, we might use a query like: FROM Transaction SELECT count(*) WHERE tags.Team = 'team-a' FACET tags.Project TIMESERIES Copy Alert on error rate for teams You can use a query for your services’ error rate for setting an alert without having to create a rule for each service. Here is the error rate for all services on a team called team-b. And this alert will automatically monitor any new app names added with the team tag. FROM Metric SELECT count(apm.service.error.count) / count(apm.service.transaction.duration) WHERE tags.Team = 'team-b' FACET appName Copy Related to this, you might create a general rule for a specific service deployed across several environments, so that we have an alarm for a single service monitoring each environment individually: From Metric SELECT count(apm.service.error.count) / count(apm.service.transaction.duration) WHERE tags.Project = 'MyProject' FACET tags.Environment Copy Query and alert on attributes As explained in the tag sources information, some important attributes are used as tags. You can query all attributes and create custom charts using NRQL, and create NRQL alert conditions.",

      "body": "New Relic monitoring is built around the concept of entities. In this doc, you'll learn how we define entities, what you can do with them, and how you can create your own entities or groupings of entities. What's an entity? From a New Relic perspective, entity is purposefully a broad concept. An entity is anything that a) reports data to New Relic or that contains data that we have access to, and b) is something we've identified with a unique entity ID. For most entities, the ID is indicated by the attribute entityGuid. An entity can be any fundamental data-reporting component, like an application, a host, or a database service, but it can also refer to larger groupings of those components. For example, to monitor a data center, you could aggregate those hosts in New Relic to be a workload (a custom grouping of entities). That workload is, itself, also an entity. Also very important is the relationships between entities. Our behind-the-scenes relationship-mapping helps us understand how entities are connected, how they affect each other. And this allows us to give you the power to configure how any data you're bringing in is related to existing entities, or how it's related to other entities. Our focus on entities and their relationships is important because our goal is to give you practical information about your business-important entities, and not give you an unhelpfully huge stream of data from a huge list of monitored things. With more insight at the entity level, you can better monitor and troubleshoot complex, modern systems. Find and explore entities and entity data Tip You can create new entity types for monitoring any data source. Learn more about entity synthesis. Some tips for finding and understanding entity data: To find an entity's entityGuid and entityName and other metadata: from any list of monitored entities in the New Relic Explorer, click an entity's icon, and click See metadata and tags. For most entities, its GUID is reported as the attribute entityGuid. For workloads, it's workloadGuid. You can run NRQL queries to find entities by their GUID. To see connections between entities, you have several options: When viewing an entity in the UI, use the Related entities UI. Service maps. Distributed tracing. Our NerdGraph API. To group entities together, see Group entities. Customize entity definitions and relationships. To learn technical details about entity types, see our GitHub repo. In an entity type's definition file, you'll see information like: The domain: for example, APM, or Infra. Its type: for example, Application or AWSECSCONTAINERINSTANCE. Default tags. The entityExpirationTime: how long data from that entity lasts in the UI, which is different from database data retention. Group and organize entities You can place entities into groups that reflect business-important relationships in your organization. For example, you might group all entities related to a specific team or department, or related to a specific service. Or you might group multiple hosts together to reflect their grouping in a data center. To group your entities, see: Tag entities. Create workloads, which allow you to group business-important sets of entities. Create entities and customize entity data Customize entity data with entity synthesis If you have telemetry from any source that's not supported by New Relic out of the box, you can propose a mapping for it. Once approved, any telemetry received by New Relic that matches your definition file will be synthesized into an entity. To learn more: For reserved attributes and how entity relationships are defined, keep reading this doc. For how to do the work of modifying existing entity types or creating new ones, see our GitHub repo on entity synthesis. Reserved attributes for synthesized entities These attributes are meant to be synthesized from the telemetry we receive. Do not set them unless you're aware of the implications and consequences. Attribute Description entity.guid Generally, you should not set this attribute field on your telemetry data. New Relic may add this field to ingested data to store a unique identifier for the entity associated with the data point. If telemetry arrives with the entity.guid attribute already present, then New Relic will not change the value. However, it may cause undefined behavior such as missing entities in the UI, or telemetry not associating with the expected entities. One use case for passing this attribute is to associate ingested telemetry with an entity already created by New Relic. When the entity.guid attribute is sent, the value will override New Relic’s entity identification system (such as entity synthesis definitions) and instead will use the attribute as the data. entity.name This attribute shouldn't be put on ingested telemetry data unless you're trying to override the entity name that would have been selected by New Relic’s entity identification system. While New Relic won't change the value if it's already present on the data, New Relic may add the attribute to your data. Therefore invalid or unexpected values may cause undefined behavior such as missing entities in the UI, or telemetry not associating with the expected entities. If this field is present on ingested telemetry, its value will be used to name the entity associated with the data point. This name will be used instead of the name selected by New Relic’s entity identification system (for example, entity synthesis definitions). Note that many entities use the name as part of their identification, so changing this field may result in the generation of a new entity. entity.type This attribute shouldn't be put on ingested telemetry data except for certain legacy cases where it's required to distinguish entity types. Passing this field may interfere with entity detection, particularly if unrecognized values are sent in this field. While New Relic won't change the value if already present on the data, the field is not guaranteed to provide unambiguous filtering of telemetry at query-time. Existing entity definitions already have overlapping values, and we recommend avoiding entity.type in favor of other fields for filtering telemetry queries. This field is used by New Relic, meaning that invalid or unexpected values may cause undefined behavior such as missing entities in the UI, or telemetry not associating with the expected entities. To learn how to do the work of modifying existing entity types or creating new ones, see our GitHub repo on entity synthesis. Entity relationships Connections between entities are automatically created by New Relic based on what we can infer from your telemetry. For example, when two services that communicate using HTTP are instrumented with New Relic, we infer a \"calls/called-by\" relationship between them. When viewing a specific entity in either the New Relic Explorer, Navigator, or Lookout, you can see its Related entities in the entity's mini overview. This gives a visualization of the various entities connected directly to the current entity. You can quickly view important metrics for these related entities and navigate from one entity to another, through all the connected parts of your stack. Tip Learn more about how entities are related with our NerdGraph API. When relationships are not automatically detected, you can manually create them using the \"Add/edit related entities\" link in Related entities. Important Currently, you can only manually create calls/called-by relationships between service entities. Tip To manage manual relationships, you need to have modify and delete capabilities on entity relationships. If you don’t see the edit relationships button, contact your account admin. Which relationships are created? These are the relationships created between entities: Source: New Relic agent Relationship source Relationship type Relationship target Why is the relationship created? Application instrumented with a New Relic agent CALLS Application instrumented with a New Relic agent Relationships between applications monitored by New Relic agents are reported using the DurationByCaller metric. The callee reports the metric. For example, the metric DurationByCaller/Mobile/100/1234/HTTP/all indicates that the caller is APPLICATION 1234 for account 100. Application instrumented with a New Relic agent CALLS Service instrumented with a New Relic agent An application (caller) that calls a service (callee) monitored by New Relic creates a relationship that's reported by the caller using the ExternalApp metric. For example, the metric ExternalApp/dirac.vips.net/100#1234/all indicates that the callee is APPLICATION 1234 for account 100. The metric is reported if the callee successfully responds to the caller. Service instrumented with a New Relic agent CALLS Service instrumented with a New Relic agent When a New Relic agent detects that a service (caller) calls another service (callee) instrumented by New Relic, the callee reports the metric ClientApplication. For example, the metric ClientApplication/100#1234/all indicates that the caller is APPLICATION 1234 for account 100. Service instrumented with a New Relic agent CALLS A datastore instance When an application calls a datastore instance it creates a relationship reported with the DatastoreInstance metric. For example, the metric Datastore/instance/MySQL/172.16.16.3/3306 indicates the datastore instance is vendor: MySQL, host: 172.16.16.3, port: 3306. This metric also supports the legacy datastore instance format Datastore/instance/MySQL/172.16.16.3:3306. Currently we cannot determine whether the datastore instance is instrumented by New Relic and has an entity associated to it. APM agent SERVES Browser agent This relationship is created when an APM agent injects the browser agent into a page. Workload entity CONTAINS Any entity When a workload is created or updated, relationships for each of the entities that belong to the workload are created. Because some workloads are “dynamic” (defined by tags), relationships are re-created every 5 minutes. This way entities can join or leave the workload. Source: Infrastructure Relationship source Relationship type Relationship target Why is the relationship created? Infrastructure host HOSTS Application This relationship is created when an application is running in one or more hosts, and the infra agent is running in those hosts. Infrastructure host HOSTS Container This relationship is created when containers are running in one or more hosts, and the host is instrumented with the infra agent. Source: Synthetics monitor Relationship source Relationship type Relationship target Why is the relationship created? Synthetics Monitor CALLS Browser agent This relationship is created when a synthetics monitor checks a page instrumented with the browser agent. Synthetics Monitor CALLS APM application Agent events that contain the attribute nr.syntheticsMonitorId have been described as synthetics monitors (the source) interacting with an APM application (the target). If the header exists and the APM application Id exists, a relationship is created between the monitor and the app. Source: Kubernetes Relationship source Relationship type Relationship target Why is the relationship created? Cluster CONTAINS Pod This relationship is created when a pod is created in a cluster instrumented with the New Relic Kubernetes integration. Cluster CONTAINS Deployment This relationship is created when a deployment is created in a cluster instrumented with the New Relic Kubernetes integration. Cluster CONTAINS DaemonSet This relationship is created when a DaemonSet is created in a cluster instrumented with the New Relic Kubernetes integration. Cluster CONTAINS StatefulSet This relationship is created when a StatefulSet is created in a cluster instrumented with the New Relic Kubernetes integration. Cluster CONTAINS Host This relationship is created when a host that's part of a cluster is instrumented with the New Relic Kubernetes integration. Deployment CONTAINS Pod This relationship is created when a deployment creates a pod in a cluster instrumented with the New Relic Kubernetes integration. DaemonSet CONTAINS Pod This relationship is created when a DaemonSet is created a pod in a cluster instrumented with the New Relic Kubernetes integration. StatefulSet CONTAINS Pod This relationship is created when a StatefulSet creates a pod in a cluster instrumented with the New Relic Kubernetes integration. Pod CONTAINS Container This relationship is created when a pod creates a container in a cluster instrumented with the New Relic Kubernetes integration. Host HOSTS Pod This relationship is created when a pod is running in a host that's part of a cluster instrumented with the New Relic Kubernetes integration. Container HOSTS Application This relationship is created when an application is running in docker, and the hosts where docker is running are instrumented by the the infra agent. External services Relationship source Relationship type Relationship target Why is the relationship created? External service CALLS External service When the relationship is created, the external service reports a span with its name on the service.name attribute and the name of the service that initiates the call in the parent.service.name attribute. Application IS External service A relationship between an application and an external service is created so that users can navigate between them using the related entities component. Browser application instrumented with a New Relic agent CALLS External service A browser application reports an Ajax/HostTransaction metric when calling an external service (URL). Example metric: Ajax/HostTransaction/api.segment.io:443/CallbackTime' Cluster CONTAINS External service When the relationship is created, the external service reports a span with the attribute k8s.cluster.name, the name of the cluster. The cluster must be instrumented with the New Relic Kubernetes integration and the cluster name set for the integration must match the one reported in the span. Pod HOSTS External service When the relationship is created, the external service reports a span with the following attributes: service.name: The name of the service. k8s.cluster.name: The name of the cluster. k8s.pod.name: The name of the pod that’s running the service. k8s.namespace.name: The namespace where the pod was created. The cluster must be instrumented with the New Relic Kubernetes integration and the cluster name set for the integration must match the one reported in the span. Create relationships manually You can create additional relationships using NerdGraph, our GraphQL API. Relationships can be created or replaced using the mutation entityRelationshipUserDefinedCreateOrReplace. As its name suggests, it allows you to create a relationship between two entities with a given type. If the relationship already exists between the two entities, it will be added again with the updated given values: the creation time and the creator user id: mutation { entityRelationshipUserDefinedCreateOrReplace( sourceEntityGuid: \"{SourceEntityGuid}\" targetEntityGuid: \"{TargetEntityGuid}\" type: BUILT_FROM ) { errors { message type } } } Copy Delete relationships using the mutation entityRelationshipUserDefinedDelete. source and target are mandatory, whereas type isn't. If the mutation its executed without any type, all the relationships between the two entities will be removed. mutation { entityRelationshipUserDefinedDelete( sourceEntityGuid: \"{SourceEntityGuid}\" targetEntityGuid: \"{TargetEntityGuid}\" type: BUILT_FROM ) { errors { message type } } } Copy Find information about fetching relationships in the relationships API tutorial. Some considerations Two entities can have multiple relationships, one for each relationship type. Two entities can hold a relationship IF they belong to the same trusted account. For each entity, you can manually define up to 2000 relationships. When the limit is reached, the API will return a LIMIT_EXCEEDED error. Each mutation can fail if you don't have access to one of the two entities (source/target). Relationship types provide additional information about how two entities are related. The supported relationship types are: Relationship types Type Description CALLS The relationship between one service or application calling another. Used to display upstream and downstream services. CONTAINS The relationship and hierarchical use cases common to modern and cloud infrastructure. For example, this could indicate that the HOST contains a container. HOSTS The relationship between an application or process and the system it runs on. SERVES The relationship between a back-end application and the browser application it returns in the response. is The relationship between an entity captured as a separate entity by another telemetry data source and the one you're currently viewing. CONNECTS_TO The source entity has a connection to the target entity. BUILT_FROM The target entity contains the code for the source entity.",

For more information on this issue, see Metric grouping issues (MGIs). To reduce high cardinality and prevent metric grouping issues, New Relic supports rules for grouping or filtering out metrics (normalization). In some cases, when MGIs with a significant high number of metrics are detected, a rule is created automatically to protect the platform from performance degradation. Metric normalization rules management You can create and manage new rules that deal with the noise produced from high cardinality metrics by using the metric normalization tool, which is accessible from each service dashboard in the New Relic Explorer. Once there, select Metric Normalization in the left sidebar. There you can see the existing rules or create new ones. Click a rule to modify it, or click Create a new rule to create a new one. A new pane to configure the rule will be displayed. Available fields are: Match expression: enter the regular expression to group all the metrics you want to include in the rule. Matches: here you will see a preview of the metrics matched by the regular expression above. Action: the action you want to perform on the metrics. Replace: replace the matched metrics by the regular expression with the value described in the Replacement field. Ignore: ignore any metric that matches the regular expression. Deny new metrics: only write metrics that have already been reported, and ignore those that match the regular expression. Replacement: only active when Replace is enabled. Matched metrics are replaced with the field's value. If the regular expression is capturing groups, you can use placeholders for them with \\1 or \\2 for the groups 1 and 2 respectively. Active: rules can’t be deleted, but can be deactivated. Click the toggle to enable or disable the rule. If you want the rule to be removed, reach out to New Relic's support. Terminate: When enabled, the rules waterfall is exited when the associated pattern is matched. Notes: internal notes on the rule. Has no effect on the rule. Once you have set up the fields, click Create (or Edit in case you are editing an existing rule), and the rule will be applied immediately as long as it's Active.",

      "body": "In the software industry, a tag typically refers to a piece of metadata added to a data set for the purpose of improving data organization and findability. At New Relic, our tags are key:value pairs (like team: operations) added to various sets of data, like monitored apps and hosts, agents, dashboards, and workloads. We make some important attributes available as tags (for example, app metadata like app name and language, and host metadata like host name and AWS region). You can also add your own custom tags. You can use tags in the UI to filter down to relevant data. Here is an example: Here you can see an accountId tag being used to filter workloads to a specific account. Tags help you to: Organize data coming from a large number of sources and/or to a large number of New Relic accounts. Identify teams, roles, environments, or regions to know who’s responsible for what (see example use cases). Better organize and search dashboards and workloads. Query and chart APM data. Tags are useful for organizing data at a high level. If you want to add more fine-grained detail, like capturing user names or other high-cardinality values, custom attributes or custom events are a better solution. Tip Tags were previously called labels in the New Relic UI. You may sometimes see labelin our code; for example, some of our APM agent config files use a label config option for tags. Tag format and limits Format requirements and limits for tags: The UI has limits on the total number of tags it can display per entity: Limit of 100 for tags reported by default or added via agent/integration configuration. Limit of 100 for custom tags added via UI or API. The following are maximum character length for tags: Key: 128 characters Value: 256 characters When using our API to add tags, a dash (-) in a tag key is interpreted as a minus symbol. If your tag key has a dash, use back ticks around it (like `key-name`). Best practices and tips Before adding tags, we recommend first seeing how our default tags work for you. When you're ready to add your own tags, review the following best practices tips to get the most out of them. Tips on keeping tags simple: Start by adding only tags you know you’ll definitely use. Unused tags create noise and may add confusion. Try to use short tags. Shorter tags are easier to parse, and also the UI may sometimes truncate longer tags. (See character limits.) When possible, use keys and values that are human-readable (for example, region: EMEA is better than Param8323 : 1229072). Avoid including several values like regions: EMEA | US | LATAM in a single tag. We recommend using three different tags for that, like region: emea, region: us, and region: latam. If you want to match multiple tags, you can do that using the advanced options in the filter UI. Tips on using tags consistently: Try to be consistent with tag language across your teams and entities. Be consistent with naming. For example, avoid using both region: emea and reg: emea. Be consistent with format. For example, avoid using both camelCase and kebab-case. Although tag searching is not case-sensitive in the UI and API, try to be consistent with capitalization. For example, avoid using both env: staging and env: Staging. Tips on cross-team implementation: Tags help improve observability and cost allocation. For this reason, responsibility for tag implementation is often assigned to an observability team, SREs, a group of architects, or a cross-team task force. We recommend the people responsible for implementing tags meet and create an internal policy to describe how the tags are defined and which conventions are to be used. Then: Keep this reference manual up to date. Automate the definition of tags when you deploy New Relic agents, at the cloud provider, or through New Relic automation tools, such as the API or Terraform. Create recurring reports that identify entities that are non-compliant with your tagging standards. Tag examples Here are some examples of common ways to use tags to organize data: Team-related tags Creating tags for team names can be helpful to understand which team, group, department, or region was responsible for a change that led to a performance issue. Team examples: team: backend team: frontend team: db Role examples: roles: architecture roles: devops roles: pm Region examples: region: emea region: america region: asia Environment-related tags You can create entities for the environment they belong to. Examples: env: production env: qa env: development env: staging Criticality-related tags You can create tags related to criticality levels, which lets you easier track the most critical issues. Examples: layer: level1 layer: level2 layer: level3 How tags are added Some important attributes, by default, are available for use as tags. For example, the account name, the account ID, and some basic host/server metadata are available as default tags. You can't remove these available-by-default tags. Here are some details about how tags are added for some specific data sources: Add tags via UI or API When you add tags via the UI or API, this occurs at the entity level. This means that, for example, if you have multiple APM agents monitoring a single entity and apply a tag via the UI, that tag is available for all data coming from that entity. To add or delete tags via the UI: Select a monitored entity, like a monitored app or host. Near the entity’s name at the top of the page, select the See metadata and manage tags menu. In the menu that pops up, add or delete a tag. For APM agents, restart your service. To manage tags via API: see our NerdGraph tagging docs. For a guide to using our CLI to automate tagging, see our developer site. APM agent tags You can add tags via the UI and API or you can add tags using APM agent configuration, both methods require you to restart your service. There are differences in how these apply tags: Via agent config: These tags are applied at the agent-level, not the entity/application level. This would be a good option if you have multiple agents monitoring different aspects of the same app (for example, a blue-green deployment model). Via the UI or API: These tags are applied at the entity/application level. Here are links to the agent configuration options: C SDK: not available Java Go .NET Node.js PHP Python Ruby For information on querying APM tags, see Query APM tags. And check out this short video on querying APM tags (3:20 minutes). Infrastructure data tags There are several ways tags are added to infrastructure entities and services: Use the UI or API to add tags at the entity level. Infrastructure agent: some attributes are available by default as tags. You can also add custom attributes, which are also available as tags in the UI. On-host integrations: some attributes are available by default as tags. You can also add tags by using integration-specific labels config options (for an example, see the labels config for the Apache integration). Cloud service integrations: by default we report tags and labels that are defined in the cloud service. To add tags, you'd add them on the cloud-service-side. Automate tags with our CLI For a guide to automating tags using our CLI tool, see our developer site. Use tags to filter the UI Use the filter field at the top of the New Relic Explorer to filter down to the entities you care about. You can use multiple filter conditions. To filter down to certain entities using tags: From one.newrelic.com, click Explorer. Click the Filter by... field to see a dropdown of available attributes and tags. You can filter by multiple elements and use advanced search options. To find an entity’s metadata and tags from the UI, here are two options: From a list of entities in the UI, at the far right, select an entity's icon. OR Select an entity. Near the top of the page, select the icon. To use the API to view tags, see our NerdGraph docs. Learn about how to use tags with dashboards and how to use tags with workloads. Custom queries, charts, and alerts Different features handle tags differently. Here are some details about how you can use NRQL to query tag data, or create NRQL condition alerts. Query and alert on APM tags You can query APM tags using NRQL. Minimum agent versions: C: not available Go: 2.3.0 Java: 4.9.0 .NET: 8.17 Node: v4.13.0 PHP: not available Python: v4.10.0.112 Ruby: 6.1.0.352 Here are some query examples: Throughput across shards Given a service that is distributed across nine shards, each shard assigned as an environment, we can plot the transaction throughput on all shards using a wildcard query like: SELECT rate(count(apm.service.transaction.duration), 1 minute) FROM Metric WHERE appName LIKE 'MyApp (%' AND transactionType = 'Other' FACET tags.Environment TIMESERIES Copy Transactions per team To see the number of transactions per service for a specific team, we might use a query like: FROM Transaction SELECT count(*) WHERE tags.Team = 'team-a' FACET tags.Project TIMESERIES Copy Alert on error rate for teams You can use a query for your services’ error rate for setting an alert without having to create a rule for each service. Here is the error rate for all services on a team called team-b. And this alert will automatically monitor any new app names added with the team tag. FROM Metric SELECT count(apm.service.error.count) / count(apm.service.transaction.duration) WHERE tags.Team = 'team-b' FACET appName Copy Related to this, you might create a general rule for a specific service deployed across several environments, so that we have an alarm for a single service monitoring each environment individually: From Metric SELECT count(apm.service.error.count) / count(apm.service.transaction.duration) WHERE tags.Project = 'MyProject' FACET tags.Environment Copy Query and alert on attributes As explained in the tag sources information, some important attributes are used as tags. You can query all attributes and create custom charts using NRQL, and create NRQL alert conditions.",

      "body": "New Relic monitoring is built around the concept of entities. In this doc, you'll learn how we define entities, what you can do with them, and how you can create your own entities or groupings of entities. What's an entity? From a New Relic perspective, entity is purposefully a broad concept. An entity is anything that a) reports data to New Relic or that contains data that we have access to, and b) is something we've identified with a unique entity ID. For most entities, the ID is indicated by the attribute entityGuid. An entity can be any fundamental data-reporting component, like an application, a host, or a database service, but it can also refer to larger groupings of those components. For example, to monitor a data center, you could aggregate those hosts in New Relic to be a workload (a custom grouping of entities). That workload is, itself, also an entity. Also very important is the relationships between entities. Our behind-the-scenes relationship-mapping helps us understand how entities are connected, how they affect each other. And this allows us to give you the power to configure how any data you're bringing in is related to existing entities, or how it's related to other entities. Our focus on entities and their relationships is important because our goal is to give you practical information about your business-important entities, and not give you an unhelpfully huge stream of data from a huge list of monitored things. With more insight at the entity level, you can better monitor and troubleshoot complex, modern systems. Find and explore entities and entity data Tip You can create new entity types for monitoring any data source. Learn more about entity synthesis. Some tips for finding and understanding entity data: To find an entity's entityGuid and entityName and other metadata: from any list of monitored entities in the New Relic Explorer, click an entity's icon, and click See metadata and tags. For most entities, its GUID is reported as the attribute entityGuid. For workloads, it's workloadGuid. You can run NRQL queries to find entities by their GUID. To see connections between entities, you have several options: When viewing an entity in the UI, use the Related entities UI. Service maps. Distributed tracing. Our NerdGraph API. To group entities together, see Group entities. Customize entity definitions and relationships. To learn technical details about entity types, see our GitHub repo. In an entity type's definition file, you'll see information like: The domain: for example, APM, or Infra. Its type: for example, Application or AWSECSCONTAINERINSTANCE. Default tags. The entityExpirationTime: how long data from that entity lasts in the UI, which is different from database data retention. Group and organize entities You can place entities into groups that reflect business-important relationships in your organization. For example, you might group all entities related to a specific team or department, or related to a specific service. Or you might group multiple hosts together to reflect their grouping in a data center. To group your entities, see: Tag entities. Create workloads, which allow you to group business-important sets of entities. Create entities and customize entity data Customize entity data with entity synthesis If you have telemetry from any source that's not supported by New Relic out of the box, you can propose a mapping for it. Once approved, any telemetry received by New Relic that matches your definition file will be synthesized into an entity. To learn more: For reserved attributes and how entity relationships are defined, keep reading this doc. For how to do the work of modifying existing entity types or creating new ones, see our GitHub repo on entity synthesis. Reserved attributes for synthesized entities These attributes are meant to be synthesized from the telemetry we receive. Do not set them unless you're aware of the implications and consequences. Attribute Description entity.guid Generally, you should not set this attribute field on your telemetry data. New Relic may add this field to ingested data to store a unique identifier for the entity associated with the data point. If telemetry arrives with the entity.guid attribute already present, then New Relic will not change the value. However, it may cause undefined behavior such as missing entities in the UI, or telemetry not associating with the expected entities. One use case for passing this attribute is to associate ingested telemetry with an entity already created by New Relic. When the entity.guid attribute is sent, the value will override New Relic’s entity identification system (such as entity synthesis definitions) and instead will use the attribute as the data. entity.name This attribute shouldn't be put on ingested telemetry data unless you're trying to override the entity name that would have been selected by New Relic’s entity identification system. While New Relic won't change the value if it's already present on the data, New Relic may add the attribute to your data. Therefore invalid or unexpected values may cause undefined behavior such as missing entities in the UI, or telemetry not associating with the expected entities. If this field is present on ingested telemetry, its value will be used to name the entity associated with the data point. This name will be used instead of the name selected by New Relic’s entity identification system (for example, entity synthesis definitions). Note that many entities use the name as part of their identification, so changing this field may result in the generation of a new entity. entity.type This attribute shouldn't be put on ingested telemetry data except for certain legacy cases where it's required to distinguish entity types. Passing this field may interfere with entity detection, particularly if unrecognized values are sent in this field. While New Relic won't change the value if already present on the data, the field is not guaranteed to provide unambiguous filtering of telemetry at query-time. Existing entity definitions already have overlapping values, and we recommend avoiding entity.type in favor of other fields for filtering telemetry queries. This field is used by New Relic, meaning that invalid or unexpected values may cause undefined behavior such as missing entities in the UI, or telemetry not associating with the expected entities. To learn how to do the work of modifying existing entity types or creating new ones, see our GitHub repo on entity synthesis. Entity relationships Connections between entities are automatically created by New Relic based on what we can infer from your telemetry. For example, when two services that communicate using HTTP are instrumented with New Relic, we infer a \"calls/called-by\" relationship between them. When viewing a specific entity in either the New Relic Explorer, Navigator, or Lookout, you can see its Related entities in the entity's mini overview. This gives a visualization of the various entities connected directly to the current entity. You can quickly view important metrics for these related entities and navigate from one entity to another, through all the connected parts of your stack. Tip Learn more about how entities are related with our NerdGraph API. When relationships are not automatically detected, you can manually create them using the \"Add/edit related entities\" link in Related entities. Important Currently, you can only manually create calls/called-by relationships between service entities. Tip To manage manual relationships, you need to have modify and delete capabilities on entity relationships. If you don’t see the edit relationships button, contact your account admin. Which relationships are created? These are the relationships created between entities: Source: New Relic agent Relationship source Relationship type Relationship target Why is the relationship created? Application instrumented with a New Relic agent CALLS Application instrumented with a New Relic agent Relationships between applications monitored by New Relic agents are reported using the DurationByCaller metric. The callee reports the metric. For example, the metric DurationByCaller/Mobile/100/1234/HTTP/all indicates that the caller is APPLICATION 1234 for account 100. Application instrumented with a New Relic agent CALLS Service instrumented with a New Relic agent An application (caller) that calls a service (callee) monitored by New Relic creates a relationship that's reported by the caller using the ExternalApp metric. For example, the metric ExternalApp/dirac.vips.net/100#1234/all indicates that the callee is APPLICATION 1234 for account 100. The metric is reported if the callee successfully responds to the caller. Service instrumented with a New Relic agent CALLS Service instrumented with a New Relic agent When a New Relic agent detects that a service (caller) calls another service (callee) instrumented by New Relic, the callee reports the metric ClientApplication. For example, the metric ClientApplication/100#1234/all indicates that the caller is APPLICATION 1234 for account 100. Service instrumented with a New Relic agent CALLS A datastore instance When an application calls a datastore instance it creates a relationship reported with the DatastoreInstance metric. For example, the metric Datastore/instance/MySQL/172.16.16.3/3306 indicates the datastore instance is vendor: MySQL, host: 172.16.16.3, port: 3306. This metric also supports the legacy datastore instance format Datastore/instance/MySQL/172.16.16.3:3306. Currently we cannot determine whether the datastore instance is instrumented by New Relic and has an entity associated to it. APM agent SERVES Browser agent This relationship is created when an APM agent injects the browser agent into a page. Workload entity CONTAINS Any entity When a workload is created or updated, relationships for each of the entities that belong to the workload are created. Because some workloads are “dynamic” (defined by tags), relationships are re-created every 5 minutes. This way entities can join or leave the workload. Source: Infrastructure Relationship source Relationship type Relationship target Why is the relationship created? Infrastructure host HOSTS Application This relationship is created when an application is running in one or more hosts, and the infra agent is running in those hosts. Infrastructure host HOSTS Container This relationship is created when containers are running in one or more hosts, and the host is instrumented with the infra agent. Source: Synthetics monitor Relationship source Relationship type Relationship target Why is the relationship created? Synthetics Monitor CALLS Browser agent This relationship is created when a synthetics monitor checks a page instrumented with the browser agent. Synthetics Monitor CALLS APM application Agent events that contain the attribute nr.syntheticsMonitorId have been described as synthetics monitors (the source) interacting with an APM application (the target). If the header exists and the APM application Id exists, a relationship is created between the monitor and the app. Source: Kubernetes Relationship source Relationship type Relationship target Why is the relationship created? Cluster CONTAINS Pod This relationship is created when a pod is created in a cluster instrumented with the New Relic Kubernetes integration. Cluster CONTAINS Deployment This relationship is created when a deployment is created in a cluster instrumented with the New Relic Kubernetes integration. Cluster CONTAINS DaemonSet This relationship is created when a DaemonSet is created in a cluster instrumented with the New Relic Kubernetes integration. Cluster CONTAINS StatefulSet This relationship is created when a StatefulSet is created in a cluster instrumented with the New Relic Kubernetes integration. Cluster CONTAINS Host This relationship is created when a host that's part of a cluster is instrumented with the New Relic Kubernetes integration. Deployment CONTAINS Pod This relationship is created when a deployment creates a pod in a cluster instrumented with the New Relic Kubernetes integration. DaemonSet CONTAINS Pod This relationship is created when a DaemonSet is created a pod in a cluster instrumented with the New Relic Kubernetes integration. StatefulSet CONTAINS Pod This relationship is created when a StatefulSet creates a pod in a cluster instrumented with the New Relic Kubernetes integration. Pod CONTAINS Container This relationship is created when a pod creates a container in a cluster instrumented with the New Relic Kubernetes integration. Host HOSTS Pod This relationship is created when a pod is running in a host that's part of a cluster instrumented with the New Relic Kubernetes integration. Container HOSTS Application This relationship is created when an application is running in docker, and the hosts where docker is running are instrumented by the the infra agent. External services Relationship source Relationship type Relationship target Why is the relationship created? External service CALLS External service When the relationship is created, the external service reports a span with its name on the service.name attribute and the name of the service that initiates the call in the parent.service.name attribute. Application IS External service A relationship between an application and an external service is created so that users can navigate between them using the related entities component. Browser application instrumented with a New Relic agent CALLS External service A browser application reports an Ajax/HostTransaction metric when calling an external service (URL). Example metric: Ajax/HostTransaction/api.segment.io:443/CallbackTime' Cluster CONTAINS External service When the relationship is created, the external service reports a span with the attribute k8s.cluster.name, the name of the cluster. The cluster must be instrumented with the New Relic Kubernetes integration and the cluster name set for the integration must match the one reported in the span. Pod HOSTS External service When the relationship is created, the external service reports a span with the following attributes: service.name: The name of the service. k8s.cluster.name: The name of the cluster. k8s.pod.name: The name of the pod that’s running the service. k8s.namespace.name: The namespace where the pod was created. The cluster must be instrumented with the New Relic Kubernetes integration and the cluster name set for the integration must match the one reported in the span. Create relationships manually You can create additional relationships using NerdGraph, our GraphQL API. Relationships can be created or replaced using the mutation entityRelationshipUserDefinedCreateOrReplace. As its name suggests, it allows you to create a relationship between two entities with a given type. If the relationship already exists between the two entities, it will be added again with the updated given values: the creation time and the creator user id: mutation { entityRelationshipUserDefinedCreateOrReplace( sourceEntityGuid: \"{SourceEntityGuid}\" targetEntityGuid: \"{TargetEntityGuid}\" type: BUILT_FROM ) { errors { message type } } } Copy Delete relationships using the mutation entityRelationshipUserDefinedDelete. source and target are mandatory, whereas type isn't. If the mutation its executed without any type, all the relationships between the two entities will be removed. mutation { entityRelationshipUserDefinedDelete( sourceEntityGuid: \"{SourceEntityGuid}\" targetEntityGuid: \"{TargetEntityGuid}\" type: BUILT_FROM ) { errors { message type } } } Copy Find information about fetching relationships in the relationships API tutorial. Some considerations Two entities can have multiple relationships, one for each relationship type. Two entities can hold a relationship IF they belong to the same trusted account. For each entity, you can manually define up to 2000 relationships. When the limit is reached, the API will return a LIMIT_EXCEEDED error. Each mutation can fail if you don't have access to one of the two entities (source/target). Relationship types provide additional information about how two entities are related. The supported relationship types are: Relationship types Type Description CALLS The relationship between one service or application calling another. Used to display upstream and downstream services. CONTAINS The relationship and hierarchical use cases common to modern and cloud infrastructure. For example, this could indicate that the HOST contains a container. HOSTS The relationship between an application or process and the system it runs on. SERVES The relationship between a back-end application and the browser application it returns in the response. is The relationship between an entity captured as a separate entity by another telemetry data source and the one you're currently viewing. CONNECTS_TO The source entity has a connection to the target entity. BUILT_FROM The target entity contains the code for the source entity.",

In some cases, when MGIs with a significant high number of metrics are detected, a rule is created automatically to protect the platform from performance degradation. Metric normalization rules management You can create and manage new rules that deal with the noise produced from high cardinality metrics by using the metric normalization tool, which is accessible from each service dashboard in the New Relic Explorer.

Matches: here you will see a preview of the metrics matched by the regular expression above. Action: the action you want to perform on the metrics. Replace: replace the matched metrics by the regular expression with the value described in the Replacement field. Ignore: ignore any metric that matches the regular expression. Deny new metrics: only write metrics that have already been reported, and ignore those that match the regular expression. Replacement: only active when Replace is enabled. Matched metrics are replaced with the field's value. If the regular expression is capturing groups, you can use placeholders for them with \\1 or \\2 for the groups 1 and 2 respectively. Active: rules can’t be deleted, but can be deactivated. Click the toggle to enable or disable the rule. If you want the rule to be removed, reach out to New Relic's support. Terminate: When enabled, the rules waterfall is exited when the associated pattern is matched. Notes: internal notes on the rule. Has no effect on the rule.

      "body": "In the software industry, a tag typically refers to a piece of metadata added to a data set for the purpose of improving data organization and findability. At New Relic, our tags are key:value pairs (like team: operations) added to various sets of data, like monitored apps and hosts, agents, dashboards, and workloads. We make some important attributes available as tags (for example, app metadata like app name and language, and host metadata like host name and AWS region). You can also add your own custom tags. You can use tags in the UI to filter down to relevant data. Here is an example: Here you can see an accountId tag being used to filter workloads to a specific account. Tags help you to: Organize data coming from a large number of sources and/or to a large number of New Relic accounts. Identify teams, roles, environments, or regions to know who’s responsible for what (see example use cases). Better organize and search dashboards and workloads. Query and chart APM data. Tags are useful for organizing data at a high level. If you want to add more fine-grained detail, like capturing user names or other high-cardinality values, custom attributes or custom events are a better solution. Tip Tags were previously called labels in the New Relic UI. You may sometimes see labelin our code; for example, some of our APM agent config files use a label config option for tags. Tag format and limits Format requirements and limits for tags: The UI has limits on the total number of tags it can display per entity: Limit of 100 for tags reported by default or added via agent/integration configuration. Limit of 100 for custom tags added via UI or API. The following are maximum character length for tags: Key: 128 characters Value: 256 characters When using our API to add tags, a dash (-) in a tag key is interpreted as a minus symbol. If your tag key has a dash, use back ticks around it (like `key-name`). Best practices and tips Before adding tags, we recommend first seeing how our default tags work for you. When you're ready to add your own tags, review the following best practices tips to get the most out of them. Tips on keeping tags simple: Start by adding only tags you know you’ll definitely use. Unused tags create noise and may add confusion. Try to use short tags. Shorter tags are easier to parse, and also the UI may sometimes truncate longer tags. (See character limits.) When possible, use keys and values that are human-readable (for example, region: EMEA is better than Param8323 : 1229072). Avoid including several values like regions: EMEA | US | LATAM in a single tag. We recommend using three different tags for that, like region: emea, region: us, and region: latam. If you want to match multiple tags, you can do that using the advanced options in the filter UI. Tips on using tags consistently: Try to be consistent with tag language across your teams and entities. Be consistent with naming. For example, avoid using both region: emea and reg: emea. Be consistent with format. For example, avoid using both camelCase and kebab-case. Although tag searching is not case-sensitive in the UI and API, try to be consistent with capitalization. For example, avoid using both env: staging and env: Staging. Tips on cross-team implementation: Tags help improve observability and cost allocation. For this reason, responsibility for tag implementation is often assigned to an observability team, SREs, a group of architects, or a cross-team task force. We recommend the people responsible for implementing tags meet and create an internal policy to describe how the tags are defined and which conventions are to be used. Then: Keep this reference manual up to date. Automate the definition of tags when you deploy New Relic agents, at the cloud provider, or through New Relic automation tools, such as the API or Terraform. Create recurring reports that identify entities that are non-compliant with your tagging standards. Tag examples Here are some examples of common ways to use tags to organize data: Team-related tags Creating tags for team names can be helpful to understand which team, group, department, or region was responsible for a change that led to a performance issue. Team examples: team: backend team: frontend team: db Role examples: roles: architecture roles: devops roles: pm Region examples: region: emea region: america region: asia Environment-related tags You can create entities for the environment they belong to. Examples: env: production env: qa env: development env: staging Criticality-related tags You can create tags related to criticality levels, which lets you easier track the most critical issues. Examples: layer: level1 layer: level2 layer: level3 How tags are added Some important attributes, by default, are available for use as tags. For example, the account name, the account ID, and some basic host/server metadata are available as default tags. You can't remove these available-by-default tags. Here are some details about how tags are added for some specific data sources: Add tags via UI or API When you add tags via the UI or API, this occurs at the entity level. This means that, for example, if you have multiple APM agents monitoring a single entity and apply a tag via the UI, that tag is available for all data coming from that entity. To add or delete tags via the UI: Select a monitored entity, like a monitored app or host. Near the entity’s name at the top of the page, select the See metadata and manage tags menu. In the menu that pops up, add or delete a tag. For APM agents, restart your service. To manage tags via API: see our NerdGraph tagging docs. For a guide to using our CLI to automate tagging, see our developer site. APM agent tags You can add tags via the UI and API or you can add tags using APM agent configuration, both methods require you to restart your service. There are differences in how these apply tags: Via agent config: These tags are applied at the agent-level, not the entity/application level. This would be a good option if you have multiple agents monitoring different aspects of the same app (for example, a blue-green deployment model). Via the UI or API: These tags are applied at the entity/application level. Here are links to the agent configuration options: C SDK: not available Java Go .NET Node.js PHP Python Ruby For information on querying APM tags, see Query APM tags. And check out this short video on querying APM tags (3:20 minutes). Infrastructure data tags There are several ways tags are added to infrastructure entities and services: Use the UI or API to add tags at the entity level. Infrastructure agent: some attributes are available by default as tags. You can also add custom attributes, which are also available as tags in the UI. On-host integrations: some attributes are available by default as tags. You can also add tags by using integration-specific labels config options (for an example, see the labels config for the Apache integration). Cloud service integrations: by default we report tags and labels that are defined in the cloud service. To add tags, you'd add them on the cloud-service-side. Automate tags with our CLI For a guide to automating tags using our CLI tool, see our developer site. Use tags to filter the UI Use the filter field at the top of the New Relic Explorer to filter down to the entities you care about. You can use multiple filter conditions. To filter down to certain entities using tags: From one.newrelic.com, click Explorer. Click the Filter by... field to see a dropdown of available attributes and tags. You can filter by multiple elements and use advanced search options. To find an entity’s metadata and tags from the UI, here are two options: From a list of entities in the UI, at the far right, select an entity's icon. OR Select an entity. Near the top of the page, select the icon. To use the API to view tags, see our NerdGraph docs. Learn about how to use tags with dashboards and how to use tags with workloads. Custom queries, charts, and alerts Different features handle tags differently. Here are some details about how you can use NRQL to query tag data, or create NRQL condition alerts. Query and alert on APM tags You can query APM tags using NRQL. Minimum agent versions: C: not available Go: 2.3.0 Java: 4.9.0 .NET: 8.17 Node: v4.13.0 PHP: not available Python: v4.10.0.112 Ruby: 6.1.0.352 Here are some query examples: Throughput across shards Given a service that is distributed across nine shards, each shard assigned as an environment, we can plot the transaction throughput on all shards using a wildcard query like: SELECT rate(count(apm.service.transaction.duration), 1 minute) FROM Metric WHERE appName LIKE 'MyApp (%' AND transactionType = 'Other' FACET tags.Environment TIMESERIES Copy Transactions per team To see the number of transactions per service for a specific team, we might use a query like: FROM Transaction SELECT count(*) WHERE tags.Team = 'team-a' FACET tags.Project TIMESERIES Copy Alert on error rate for teams You can use a query for your services’ error rate for setting an alert without having to create a rule for each service. Here is the error rate for all services on a team called team-b. And this alert will automatically monitor any new app names added with the team tag. FROM Metric SELECT count(apm.service.error.count) / count(apm.service.transaction.duration) WHERE tags.Team = 'team-b' FACET appName Copy Related to this, you might create a general rule for a specific service deployed across several environments, so that we have an alarm for a single service monitoring each environment individually: From Metric SELECT count(apm.service.error.count) / count(apm.service.transaction.duration) WHERE tags.Project = 'MyProject' FACET tags.Environment Copy Query and alert on attributes As explained in the tag sources information, some important attributes are used as tags. You can query all attributes and create custom charts using NRQL, and create NRQL alert conditions.",

      "body": "New Relic monitoring is built around the concept of entities. In this doc, you'll learn how we define entities, what you can do with them, and how you can create your own entities or groupings of entities. What's an entity? From a New Relic perspective, entity is purposefully a broad concept. An entity is anything that a) reports data to New Relic or that contains data that we have access to, and b) is something we've identified with a unique entity ID. For most entities, the ID is indicated by the attribute entityGuid. An entity can be any fundamental data-reporting component, like an application, a host, or a database service, but it can also refer to larger groupings of those components. For example, to monitor a data center, you could aggregate those hosts in New Relic to be a workload (a custom grouping of entities). That workload is, itself, also an entity. Also very important is the relationships between entities. Our behind-the-scenes relationship-mapping helps us understand how entities are connected, how they affect each other. And this allows us to give you the power to configure how any data you're bringing in is related to existing entities, or how it's related to other entities. Our focus on entities and their relationships is important because our goal is to give you practical information about your business-important entities, and not give you an unhelpfully huge stream of data from a huge list of monitored things. With more insight at the entity level, you can better monitor and troubleshoot complex, modern systems. Find and explore entities and entity data Tip You can create new entity types for monitoring any data source. Learn more about entity synthesis. Some tips for finding and understanding entity data: To find an entity's entityGuid and entityName and other metadata: from any list of monitored entities in the New Relic Explorer, click an entity's icon, and click See metadata and tags. For most entities, its GUID is reported as the attribute entityGuid. For workloads, it's workloadGuid. You can run NRQL queries to find entities by their GUID. To see connections between entities, you have several options: When viewing an entity in the UI, use the Related entities UI. Service maps. Distributed tracing. Our NerdGraph API. To group entities together, see Group entities. Customize entity definitions and relationships. To learn technical details about entity types, see our GitHub repo. In an entity type's definition file, you'll see information like: The domain: for example, APM, or Infra. Its type: for example, Application or AWSECSCONTAINERINSTANCE. Default tags. The entityExpirationTime: how long data from that entity lasts in the UI, which is different from database data retention. Group and organize entities You can place entities into groups that reflect business-important relationships in your organization. For example, you might group all entities related to a specific team or department, or related to a specific service. Or you might group multiple hosts together to reflect their grouping in a data center. To group your entities, see: Tag entities. Create workloads, which allow you to group business-important sets of entities. Create entities and customize entity data Customize entity data with entity synthesis If you have telemetry from any source that's not supported by New Relic out of the box, you can propose a mapping for it. Once approved, any telemetry received by New Relic that matches your definition file will be synthesized into an entity. To learn more: For reserved attributes and how entity relationships are defined, keep reading this doc. For how to do the work of modifying existing entity types or creating new ones, see our GitHub repo on entity synthesis. Reserved attributes for synthesized entities These attributes are meant to be synthesized from the telemetry we receive. Do not set them unless you're aware of the implications and consequences. Attribute Description entity.guid Generally, you should not set this attribute field on your telemetry data. New Relic may add this field to ingested data to store a unique identifier for the entity associated with the data point. If telemetry arrives with the entity.guid attribute already present, then New Relic will not change the value. However, it may cause undefined behavior such as missing entities in the UI, or telemetry not associating with the expected entities. One use case for passing this attribute is to associate ingested telemetry with an entity already created by New Relic. When the entity.guid attribute is sent, the value will override New Relic’s entity identification system (such as entity synthesis definitions) and instead will use the attribute as the data. entity.name This attribute shouldn't be put on ingested telemetry data unless you're trying to override the entity name that would have been selected by New Relic’s entity identification system. While New Relic won't change the value if it's already present on the data, New Relic may add the attribute to your data. Therefore invalid or unexpected values may cause undefined behavior such as missing entities in the UI, or telemetry not associating with the expected entities. If this field is present on ingested telemetry, its value will be used to name the entity associated with the data point. This name will be used instead of the name selected by New Relic’s entity identification system (for example, entity synthesis definitions). Note that many entities use the name as part of their identification, so changing this field may result in the generation of a new entity. entity.type This attribute shouldn't be put on ingested telemetry data except for certain legacy cases where it's required to distinguish entity types. Passing this field may interfere with entity detection, particularly if unrecognized values are sent in this field. While New Relic won't change the value if already present on the data, the field is not guaranteed to provide unambiguous filtering of telemetry at query-time. Existing entity definitions already have overlapping values, and we recommend avoiding entity.type in favor of other fields for filtering telemetry queries. This field is used by New Relic, meaning that invalid or unexpected values may cause undefined behavior such as missing entities in the UI, or telemetry not associating with the expected entities. To learn how to do the work of modifying existing entity types or creating new ones, see our GitHub repo on entity synthesis. Entity relationships Connections between entities are automatically created by New Relic based on what we can infer from your telemetry. For example, when two services that communicate using HTTP are instrumented with New Relic, we infer a \"calls/called-by\" relationship between them. When viewing a specific entity in either the New Relic Explorer, Navigator, or Lookout, you can see its Related entities in the entity's mini overview. This gives a visualization of the various entities connected directly to the current entity. You can quickly view important metrics for these related entities and navigate from one entity to another, through all the connected parts of your stack. Tip Learn more about how entities are related with our NerdGraph API. When relationships are not automatically detected, you can manually create them using the \"Add/edit related entities\" link in Related entities. Important Currently, you can only manually create calls/called-by relationships between service entities. Tip To manage manual relationships, you need to have modify and delete capabilities on entity relationships. If you don’t see the edit relationships button, contact your account admin. Which relationships are created? These are the relationships created between entities: Source: New Relic agent Relationship source Relationship type Relationship target Why is the relationship created? Application instrumented with a New Relic agent CALLS Application instrumented with a New Relic agent Relationships between applications monitored by New Relic agents are reported using the DurationByCaller metric. The callee reports the metric. For example, the metric DurationByCaller/Mobile/100/1234/HTTP/all indicates that the caller is APPLICATION 1234 for account 100. Application instrumented with a New Relic agent CALLS Service instrumented with a New Relic agent An application (caller) that calls a service (callee) monitored by New Relic creates a relationship that's reported by the caller using the ExternalApp metric. For example, the metric ExternalApp/dirac.vips.net/100#1234/all indicates that the callee is APPLICATION 1234 for account 100. The metric is reported if the callee successfully responds to the caller. Service instrumented with a New Relic agent CALLS Service instrumented with a New Relic agent When a New Relic agent detects that a service (caller) calls another service (callee) instrumented by New Relic, the callee reports the metric ClientApplication. For example, the metric ClientApplication/100#1234/all indicates that the caller is APPLICATION 1234 for account 100. Service instrumented with a New Relic agent CALLS A datastore instance When an application calls a datastore instance it creates a relationship reported with the DatastoreInstance metric. For example, the metric Datastore/instance/MySQL/172.16.16.3/3306 indicates the datastore instance is vendor: MySQL, host: 172.16.16.3, port: 3306. This metric also supports the legacy datastore instance format Datastore/instance/MySQL/172.16.16.3:3306.

Create relationships manually You can create additional relationships using NerdGraph, our GraphQL API. Relationships can be created or replaced using the mutation entityRelationshipUserDefinedCreateOrReplace. As its name suggests, it allows you to create a relationship between two entities with a given type. If the relationship already exists between the two entities, it will be added again with the updated given values: the creation time and the creator user id: mutation { entityRelationshipUserDefinedCreateOrReplace( sourceEntityGuid: \"{SourceEntityGuid}\" targetEntityGuid: \"{TargetEntityGuid}\" type: BUILT_FROM ) { errors { message type } } } Copy Delete relationships using the mutation entityRelationshipUserDefinedDelete. source and target are mandatory, whereas type isn't. If the mutation its executed without any type, all the relationships between the two entities will be removed. mutation { entityRelationshipUserDefinedDelete( sourceEntityGuid: \"{SourceEntityGuid}\" targetEntityGuid: \"{TargetEntityGuid}\" type: BUILT_FROM ) { errors { message type } } } Copy Find information about fetching relationships in the relationships API tutorial. Some considerations Two entities can have multiple relationships, one for each relationship type. Two entities can hold a relationship IF they belong to the same trusted account. For each entity, you can manually define up to 2000 relationships. When the limit is reached, the API will return a LIMIT_EXCEEDED error. Each mutation can fail if you don't have access to one of the two entities (source/target). Relationship types provide additional information about how two entities are related. The supported relationship types are: Relationship types Type Description CALLS The relationship between one service or application calling another. Used to display upstream and downstream services.

      "body": "New Relic monitoring is built around the concept of entities. In this doc, you'll learn how we define entities, what you can do with them, and how you can create your own entities or groupings of entities. What's an entity? From a New Relic perspective, entity is purposefully a broad concept. An entity is anything that a) reports data to New Relic or that contains data that we have access to, and b) is something we've identified with a unique entity ID. For most entities, the ID is indicated by the attribute entityGuid. An entity can be any fundamental data-reporting component, like an application, a host, or a database service, but it can also refer to larger groupings of those components. For example, to monitor a data center, you could aggregate those hosts in New Relic to be a workload (a custom grouping of entities). That workload is, itself, also an entity. Also very important is the relationships between entities. Our behind-the-scenes relationship-mapping helps us understand how entities are connected, how they affect each other. And this allows us to give you the power to configure how any data you're bringing in is related to existing entities, or how it's related to other entities. Our focus on entities and their relationships is important because our goal is to give you practical information about your business-important entities, and not give you an unhelpfully huge stream of data from a huge list of monitored things. With more insight at the entity level, you can better monitor and troubleshoot complex, modern systems. Find and explore entities and entity data Tip You can create new entity types for monitoring any data source. Learn more about entity synthesis. Some tips for finding and understanding entity data: To find an entity's entityGuid and entityName and other metadata: from any list of monitored entities in the New Relic Explorer, click an entity's icon, and click See metadata and tags. For most entities, its GUID is reported as the attribute entityGuid. For workloads, it's workloadGuid. You can run NRQL queries to find entities by their GUID. To see connections between entities, you have several options: When viewing an entity in the UI, use the Related entities UI. Service maps. Distributed tracing. Our NerdGraph API. To group entities together, see Group entities. Customize entity definitions and relationships. To learn technical details about entity types, see our GitHub repo. In an entity type's definition file, you'll see information like: The domain: for example, APM, or Infra. Its type: for example, Application or AWSECSCONTAINERINSTANCE. Default tags. The entityExpirationTime: how long data from that entity lasts in the UI, which is different from database data retention. Group and organize entities You can place entities into groups that reflect business-important relationships in your organization. For example, you might group all entities related to a specific team or department, or related to a specific service. Or you might group multiple hosts together to reflect their grouping in a data center. To group your entities, see: Tag entities. Create workloads, which allow you to group business-important sets of entities. Create entities and customize entity data Customize entity data with entity synthesis If you have telemetry from any source that's not supported by New Relic out of the box, you can propose a mapping for it. Once approved, any telemetry received by New Relic that matches your definition file will be synthesized into an entity. To learn more: For reserved attributes and how entity relationships are defined, keep reading this doc. For how to do the work of modifying existing entity types or creating new ones, see our GitHub repo on entity synthesis. Reserved attributes for synthesized entities These attributes are meant to be synthesized from the telemetry we receive. Do not set them unless you're aware of the implications and consequences. Attribute Description entity.guid Generally, you should not set this attribute field on your telemetry data. New Relic may add this field to ingested data to store a unique identifier for the entity associated with the data point. If telemetry arrives with the entity.guid attribute already present, then New Relic will not change the value. However, it may cause undefined behavior such as missing entities in the UI, or telemetry not associating with the expected entities. One use case for passing this attribute is to associate ingested telemetry with an entity already created by New Relic. When the entity.guid attribute is sent, the value will override New Relic’s entity identification system (such as entity synthesis definitions) and instead will use the attribute as the data. entity.name This attribute shouldn't be put on ingested telemetry data unless you're trying to override the entity name that would have been selected by New Relic’s entity identification system. While New Relic won't change the value if it's already present on the data, New Relic may add the attribute to your data. Therefore invalid or unexpected values may cause undefined behavior such as missing entities in the UI, or telemetry not associating with the expected entities. If this field is present on ingested telemetry, its value will be used to name the entity associated with the data point. This name will be used instead of the name selected by New Relic’s entity identification system (for example, entity synthesis definitions). Note that many entities use the name as part of their identification, so changing this field may result in the generation of a new entity. entity.type This attribute shouldn't be put on ingested telemetry data except for certain legacy cases where it's required to distinguish entity types. Passing this field may interfere with entity detection, particularly if unrecognized values are sent in this field. While New Relic won't change the value if already present on the data, the field is not guaranteed to provide unambiguous filtering of telemetry at query-time. Existing entity definitions already have overlapping values, and we recommend avoiding entity.type in favor of other fields for filtering telemetry queries. This field is used by New Relic, meaning that invalid or unexpected values may cause undefined behavior such as missing entities in the UI, or telemetry not associating with the expected entities. To learn how to do the work of modifying existing entity types or creating new ones, see our GitHub repo on entity synthesis. Entity relationships Connections between entities are automatically created by New Relic based on what we can infer from your telemetry. For example, when two services that communicate using HTTP are instrumented with New Relic, we infer a \"calls/called-by\" relationship between them. When viewing a specific entity in either the New Relic Explorer, Navigator, or Lookout, you can see its Related entities in the entity's mini overview. This gives a visualization of the various entities connected directly to the current entity. You can quickly view important metrics for these related entities and navigate from one entity to another, through all the connected parts of your stack. Tip Learn more about how entities are related with our NerdGraph API. When relationships are not automatically detected, you can manually create them using the \"Add/edit related entities\" link in Related entities. Important Currently, you can only manually create calls/called-by relationships between service entities. Tip To manage manual relationships, you need to have modify and delete capabilities on entity relationships. If you don’t see the edit relationships button, contact your account admin. Which relationships are created? These are the relationships created between entities: Source: New Relic agent Relationship source Relationship type Relationship target Why is the relationship created? Application instrumented with a New Relic agent CALLS Application instrumented with a New Relic agent Relationships between applications monitored by New Relic agents are reported using the DurationByCaller metric. The callee reports the metric. For example, the metric DurationByCaller/Mobile/100/1234/HTTP/all indicates that the caller is APPLICATION 1234 for account 100. Application instrumented with a New Relic agent CALLS Service instrumented with a New Relic agent An application (caller) that calls a service (callee) monitored by New Relic creates a relationship that's reported by the caller using the ExternalApp metric. For example, the metric ExternalApp/dirac.vips.net/100#1234/all indicates that the callee is APPLICATION 1234 for account 100. The metric is reported if the callee successfully responds to the caller. Service instrumented with a New Relic agent CALLS Service instrumented with a New Relic agent When a New Relic agent detects that a service (caller) calls another service (callee) instrumented by New Relic, the callee reports the metric ClientApplication. For example, the metric ClientApplication/100#1234/all indicates that the caller is APPLICATION 1234 for account 100. Service instrumented with a New Relic agent CALLS A datastore instance When an application calls a datastore instance it creates a relationship reported with the DatastoreInstance metric. For example, the metric Datastore/instance/MySQL/172.16.16.3/3306 indicates the datastore instance is vendor: MySQL, host: 172.16.16.3, port: 3306. This metric also supports the legacy datastore instance format Datastore/instance/MySQL/172.16.16.3:3306. Currently we cannot determine whether the datastore instance is instrumented by New Relic and has an entity associated to it.

Once there, select Metric Normalization in the left sidebar. There you can see the existing rules or create new ones. Click a rule to modify it, or click Create a new rule to create a new one. A new pane to configure the rule will be displayed. Available fields are: Match expression: enter the regular expression to group all the metrics you want to include in the rule. Matches: here you will see a preview of the metrics matched by the regular expression above. Action: the action you want to perform on the metrics. Replace: replace the matched metrics by the regular expression with the value described in the Replacement field. Ignore: ignore any metric that matches the regular expression. Deny new metrics: only write metrics that have already been reported, and ignore those that match the regular expression. Replacement: only active when Replace is enabled. Matched metrics are replaced with the field's value. If the regular expression is capturing groups, you can use placeholders for them with \\1 or \\2 for the groups 1 and 2 respectively. Active: rules can’t be deleted, but can be deactivated. Click the toggle to enable or disable the rule. If you want the rule to be removed, reach out to New Relic's support. Terminate: When enabled, the rules waterfall is exited when the associated pattern is matched. Notes: internal notes on the rule. Has no effect on the rule. Once you have set up the fields, click Create (or Edit in case you are editing an existing rule), and the rule will be applied immediately as long as it's Active.",

      "body": "New Relic Lookout provides visibility into your entire estate. It doesn't require any configuration — you can query anything in your estate that matters to you right now and understand your system as a whole, or dive deep into causes and effects, so you can quickly get the data you need to take action. Know exactly where to focus your attention with New Relic Lookout. The brighter the color, the more severe the change, and the bigger the size, the bigger the scale. Then dig deeper with correlations and abnormal history to see how it impacts your whole system—no configuration needed. Why it matters New Relic Lookout helps software teams of any size discover potential issues before they have an impact. Fill gaps in monitoring with full coverage out-of-the-box, no configuration or setup required. Immediately see anything deviating from normal across your entire estate. Proactively spot emerging problems in a real-time visualization of all system components. Gain faster incidents resolution through automatically surfaced causes and effects. Analyze any data in New Relic database (NRDB), including third-party, open, and custom data. Launch into other areas of New Relic One for deeper understanding Requirements New Relic Lookout requires Pro or Enterprise edition. If you are on Standard edition, you can still use the New Relic Lookout view in the New Relic Explorer. If you want to see data spanning 13-months, correlations, profiles, traces, and other details, you must upgrade to a higher edition. Get started with New Relic Lookout To access New Relic Lookout, click the Apps button in New Relic One and locate the New Relic Lookout launcher. You can also access New Relic Lookout directly from the New Relic One header bar, via the More dropdown. Enablement of key service performance indicator data is required for New Relic Lookout to provide value from the data you already have. The default view provides insight into three key Service performance indicators broken down by application: throughput, response time, and errors. These metrics are analyzed to show how the data has behaved during the last five minutes compared to the prior hour. one.newrelic.com > Apps > New Relic Lookout: Anything that significantly deviates from the trend is automatically discovered by New Relic Lookout, which doesn't require any configuration. Circle visualization and table view Each application (or other facet) is represented by a circle. The size of the circles indicate the magnitude of the signal for that application and the color indicates whether the value has significantly decreased or increased in the last five minutes, based on the standard deviation of the prior hour (default evaluation and comparison time windows.) Please note that the type of signal is important when interpreting your results. When you first look at the legend below, you might be tempted to interpret yellow as good and dark purple as bad, but that is not always the case. Here are some examples: In the APM/services golden signals, a dark yellow circle in Throughput might signify that something bad has occurred and led to a drop in traffic. At the same time, a dark purple circle might also be concerning due to unexpected load. Both are significant findings worth exploring. In browser golden signals, a dark purple circle in Page Views might be great, as you are seeing more traffic to your site! With errors golden signals (in all entity types), a large circle, even if gray (not deviating from normal volume), is worth exploring because a high count of errors in your system is important to investigate. The legend allows you to change the colors used to highlight deviating services To change the color palette, click the gear icon by the low-high color legend. This allows you to change the colors used to highlight deviating services. To get a table view of the same data, click the toggle on the right. You can also hover over each color to filter the view by degree lower or higher deviance. Abnormal golden signals On the right, New Relic Lookout displays the most significantly deviating applications (or other facet) in a side panel, weighted by both the magnitude of the performance indicators and the scale of their deviations. Details include the name of the key performance indicator, their magnitude during the recent time window, and the difference between the averages from one time compared to the other. Instant search Click the magnifying glass icon in the side panel to open a search box. Typing into the search box filters the circles, table, and abnormal signals to applications (or other facets) that contain the text. This is a good way to quickly zoom to various subsystems. New Relic Lookout doesn't rerun the analysis when using the instant search. Change view Click the Change View button on the right side panel. The panel that appears shows you all the entity-specific golden signals you can toggle between out of the box. By choosing the Browser Golden Signal or other views, you can change from the default view. Each new view will have the golden signals appropriate for that entity type. Drill down into the details To analyze an application or facet, click a circle, table row, or abnormal golden signal. The details panel shows the degree of deviation of the performance indicator, a link to the affected entity, and recent alert and deployment activity for that entity, when available. There’s also an indication of whether the selected evaluation time period would be abnormal or not in reference to other comparison time windows, such as the same time yesterday or the same time last week. This allows you to quickly see if the abnormal behavior is odd in general, or just based on the comparison time window. Performance tab The default tab shows charts for other key performance indicators for the selected application or facet. The charts compare the two time windows being analyzed. You can click their titles to rerun the analysis, focusing on the selected key performance indicator. When the target is a New Relic One application, we show the top transactions, error classes, external services, and database operations, alongside links to the relevant New Relic One features. Abnormal History tab This section analyzes past performance of the selected signal and calls out any time periods with notable abnormalities. Each card represents an abnormal time window and can be clicked for more details. The charts will display any relevant violations and deployments in New Relic. Correlations tab New Relic Lookout can find other signals that began behaving differently around the same time as the selected signal for that entity type. Clicking the name of the signal reruns the analysis, focusing on that key performance indicator. The chart titles link to New Relic One when there’s an associated entity in your account. Note that correlations currently do not analyze across accounts. The correlated signals displayed are for others in the account of the original application you are viewing. This helps focus the data on correlations that are more likely related to your issue. Profile tab Based on the same technology as New Relic’s error profiles, this tab compares the last five minutes to the prior hour by default (or whatever time windows you’ve selected with query editing) and surfaces any attributes that have significantly different distributions in the events being targeted by the selected signal. For example, if a custom attribute indicated that a recent throughput spike came from one user, that would surface highly in Profiles if most of the traffic usually comes from many users. Traces tab If the entity has distributed traces configured and available in the selected evaluated time window, the Traces section is enabled. Each card shows a summary of a trace and can be clicked for details. The Explore all traces links to the distributed traces application, filtered to the selected entity. Create a custom view To target signals and time windows beyond the default values, click the Change view button and select Custom view. To create your own view: Select the account or subaccount. Select the data type (metrics or events). Different functionality is available depending on the type. In View a chart with, select the metric or event you are interested in. Default is golden signals (throughput, response time, and errors). You can also build custom queries (filters) to target a signal that isn't on the list. In Facet by, select what the circles represent. Default is appName, but you can also choose host or any other facetable attribute available for the signal you’ve selected. If you plan to save/favorite this new view, provide a name in the Name your view box. Keep in mind that you can edit this view at any time using the pencil icon. The default time windows analyzed by New Relic Lookout are the last five minutes compared to the hour before. Use the time controls (View data from and Compare data to) to target other time windows. one.newrelic.com > Apps > New Relic Lookout: All event and metric data in the New Relic database can be queried using the Edit query feature. Click Analyze to begin analyzing the signal you’ve selected. You can also create your own query: Create your query. This query is comparing data from the past thirty minutes to data from the same range a day ago. Change from Basic to Advanced after clicking the Custom view button. Select the data type (metrics or events). Different functionality is available depending on the type. Enter your query using NRQL. Please note that not all NRQL features are available in the Lookout Advanced query feature. By default, the system will run this query using the last five minutes of data compared to the previous hour. Some examples of the syntax for changing the comparison and evaluation time windows are below. Click Analyze to begin analyzing the signal you’ve selected. Query: Compare the last 15 minutes to the same time 1 day ago Please note that the UNTIL NOW portion is required here unlike in standard NRQL. Without the UNTIL NOW added, the system will query a 5 minute slice of data starting 15 minutes ago SINCE 15 minutes AGO UNTIL NOW COMPARE WITH 1 day ago Copy Query: Compare a specific time range to the same range a month ago SINCE '2021-03-07 07:00:00-0500' UNTIL '2021-03-08 07:00:00-0500' COMPARE WITH 1 month ago Copy Or: SINCE 'today at midnight' UNTIL 'now' COMPARE WITH 1 MONTH AGO Copy Example: Unusual increases in error count The default view of New Relic Lookout shows application status across your estate, comparing the last five minutes to the hour before. Under regular operation, most large systems may have a handful of abnormalities, but usually most things will indicate normal behavior. Suddenly, several circles begin to change to red under the Errors section. This indicates that several applications are experiencing unusual increases in error count. It may be that one or two circles for important systems are red, and perhaps much larger than they usually appear. Clicking one of these can provide more information on what is happening. You might see that the error rate is substantially elevated, even thousands of percent higher than normal. To troubleshoot this issue, here's what you might discover in the New Relic Lookout tabs: Performance would show you data about other signals, illuminating the characteristics of the change in system dynamics. Correlations would surface other applications that are affected and how, as well as opportunities to pivot to other applications that may be closer to the underlying causes. Traces, in turn, would show distributed traces, which can provide specific examples of traffic running through those systems. Abnormal history would show other times in the past week with elevated errors, showing whether or not this problem happens regularly, such as every day at the same time or whenever there is a deployment. Profiles might show that all or most of the new errors share common properties, such as all being isolated to just one region/account/user. Combining the information from these sections, not only can you get a sense of what is going on, but also where to focus actions to resolve the problem.",

      "body": "In the software industry, a tag typically refers to a piece of metadata added to a data set for the purpose of improving data organization and findability. At New Relic, our tags are key:value pairs (like team: operations) added to various sets of data, like monitored apps and hosts, agents, dashboards, and workloads. We make some important attributes available as tags (for example, app metadata like app name and language, and host metadata like host name and AWS region). You can also add your own custom tags. You can use tags in the UI to filter down to relevant data. Here is an example: Here you can see an accountId tag being used to filter workloads to a specific account. Tags help you to: Organize data coming from a large number of sources and/or to a large number of New Relic accounts. Identify teams, roles, environments, or regions to know who’s responsible for what (see example use cases). Better organize and search dashboards and workloads. Query and chart APM data. Tags are useful for organizing data at a high level. If you want to add more fine-grained detail, like capturing user names or other high-cardinality values, custom attributes or custom events are a better solution. Tip Tags were previously called labels in the New Relic UI. You may sometimes see labelin our code; for example, some of our APM agent config files use a label config option for tags. Tag format and limits Format requirements and limits for tags: The UI has limits on the total number of tags it can display per entity: Limit of 100 for tags reported by default or added via agent/integration configuration. Limit of 100 for custom tags added via UI or API. The following are maximum character length for tags: Key: 128 characters Value: 256 characters When using our API to add tags, a dash (-) in a tag key is interpreted as a minus symbol. If your tag key has a dash, use back ticks around it (like `key-name`). Best practices and tips Before adding tags, we recommend first seeing how our default tags work for you. When you're ready to add your own tags, review the following best practices tips to get the most out of them. Tips on keeping tags simple: Start by adding only tags you know you’ll definitely use. Unused tags create noise and may add confusion. Try to use short tags. Shorter tags are easier to parse, and also the UI may sometimes truncate longer tags. (See character limits.) When possible, use keys and values that are human-readable (for example, region: EMEA is better than Param8323 : 1229072). Avoid including several values like regions: EMEA | US | LATAM in a single tag. We recommend using three different tags for that, like region: emea, region: us, and region: latam. If you want to match multiple tags, you can do that using the advanced options in the filter UI. Tips on using tags consistently: Try to be consistent with tag language across your teams and entities. Be consistent with naming. For example, avoid using both region: emea and reg: emea. Be consistent with format. For example, avoid using both camelCase and kebab-case. Although tag searching is not case-sensitive in the UI and API, try to be consistent with capitalization. For example, avoid using both env: staging and env: Staging. Tips on cross-team implementation: Tags help improve observability and cost allocation. For this reason, responsibility for tag implementation is often assigned to an observability team, SREs, a group of architects, or a cross-team task force. We recommend the people responsible for implementing tags meet and create an internal policy to describe how the tags are defined and which conventions are to be used. Then: Keep this reference manual up to date. Automate the definition of tags when you deploy New Relic agents, at the cloud provider, or through New Relic automation tools, such as the API or Terraform. Create recurring reports that identify entities that are non-compliant with your tagging standards. Tag examples Here are some examples of common ways to use tags to organize data: Team-related tags Creating tags for team names can be helpful to understand which team, group, department, or region was responsible for a change that led to a performance issue. Team examples: team: backend team: frontend team: db Role examples: roles: architecture roles: devops roles: pm Region examples: region: emea region: america region: asia Environment-related tags You can create entities for the environment they belong to. Examples: env: production env: qa env: development env: staging Criticality-related tags You can create tags related to criticality levels, which lets you easier track the most critical issues. Examples: layer: level1 layer: level2 layer: level3 How tags are added Some important attributes, by default, are available for use as tags. For example, the account name, the account ID, and some basic host/server metadata are available as default tags. You can't remove these available-by-default tags. Here are some details about how tags are added for some specific data sources: Add tags via UI or API When you add tags via the UI or API, this occurs at the entity level. This means that, for example, if you have multiple APM agents monitoring a single entity and apply a tag via the UI, that tag is available for all data coming from that entity. To add or delete tags via the UI: Select a monitored entity, like a monitored app or host. Near the entity’s name at the top of the page, select the See metadata and manage tags menu. In the menu that pops up, add or delete a tag. For APM agents, restart your service. To manage tags via API: see our NerdGraph tagging docs. For a guide to using our CLI to automate tagging, see our developer site. APM agent tags You can add tags via the UI and API or you can add tags using APM agent configuration, both methods require you to restart your service. There are differences in how these apply tags: Via agent config: These tags are applied at the agent-level, not the entity/application level. This would be a good option if you have multiple agents monitoring different aspects of the same app (for example, a blue-green deployment model). Via the UI or API: These tags are applied at the entity/application level. Here are links to the agent configuration options: C SDK: not available Java Go .NET Node.js PHP Python Ruby For information on querying APM tags, see Query APM tags. And check out this short video on querying APM tags (3:20 minutes). Infrastructure data tags There are several ways tags are added to infrastructure entities and services: Use the UI or API to add tags at the entity level. Infrastructure agent: some attributes are available by default as tags. You can also add custom attributes, which are also available as tags in the UI. On-host integrations: some attributes are available by default as tags. You can also add tags by using integration-specific labels config options (for an example, see the labels config for the Apache integration). Cloud service integrations: by default we report tags and labels that are defined in the cloud service. To add tags, you'd add them on the cloud-service-side. Automate tags with our CLI For a guide to automating tags using our CLI tool, see our developer site. Use tags to filter the UI Use the filter field at the top of the New Relic Explorer to filter down to the entities you care about. You can use multiple filter conditions. To filter down to certain entities using tags: From one.newrelic.com, click Explorer. Click the Filter by... field to see a dropdown of available attributes and tags. You can filter by multiple elements and use advanced search options. To find an entity’s metadata and tags from the UI, here are two options: From a list of entities in the UI, at the far right, select an entity's icon. OR Select an entity. Near the top of the page, select the icon. To use the API to view tags, see our NerdGraph docs. Learn about how to use tags with dashboards and how to use tags with workloads. Custom queries, charts, and alerts Different features handle tags differently. Here are some details about how you can use NRQL to query tag data, or create NRQL condition alerts. Query and alert on APM tags You can query APM tags using NRQL. Minimum agent versions: C: not available Go: 2.3.0 Java: 4.9.0 .NET: 8.17 Node: v4.13.0 PHP: not available Python: v4.10.0.112 Ruby: 6.1.0.352 Here are some query examples: Throughput across shards Given a service that is distributed across nine shards, each shard assigned as an environment, we can plot the transaction throughput on all shards using a wildcard query like: SELECT rate(count(apm.service.transaction.duration), 1 minute) FROM Metric WHERE appName LIKE 'MyApp (%' AND transactionType = 'Other' FACET tags.Environment TIMESERIES Copy Transactions per team To see the number of transactions per service for a specific team, we might use a query like: FROM Transaction SELECT count(*) WHERE tags.Team = 'team-a' FACET tags.Project TIMESERIES Copy Alert on error rate for teams You can use a query for your services’ error rate for setting an alert without having to create a rule for each service. Here is the error rate for all services on a team called team-b. And this alert will automatically monitor any new app names added with the team tag. FROM Metric SELECT count(apm.service.error.count) / count(apm.service.transaction.duration) WHERE tags.Team = 'team-b' FACET appName Copy Related to this, you might create a general rule for a specific service deployed across several environments, so that we have an alarm for a single service monitoring each environment individually: From Metric SELECT count(apm.service.error.count) / count(apm.service.transaction.duration) WHERE tags.Project = 'MyProject' FACET tags.Environment Copy Query and alert on attributes As explained in the tag sources information, some important attributes are used as tags. You can query all attributes and create custom charts using NRQL, and create NRQL alert conditions.",

      "body": "New Relic Lookout provides visibility into your entire estate. It doesn't require any configuration — you can query anything in your estate that matters to you right now and understand your system as a whole, or dive deep into causes and effects, so you can quickly get the data you need to take action. Know exactly where to focus your attention with New Relic Lookout. The brighter the color, the more severe the change, and the bigger the size, the bigger the scale. Then dig deeper with correlations and abnormal history to see how it impacts your whole system—no configuration needed. Why it matters New Relic Lookout helps software teams of any size discover potential issues before they have an impact. Fill gaps in monitoring with full coverage out-of-the-box, no configuration or setup required. Immediately see anything deviating from normal across your entire estate. Proactively spot emerging problems in a real-time visualization of all system components. Gain faster incidents resolution through automatically surfaced causes and effects. Analyze any data in New Relic database (NRDB), including third-party, open, and custom data. Launch into other areas of New Relic One for deeper understanding Requirements New Relic Lookout requires Pro or Enterprise edition. If you are on Standard edition, you can still use the New Relic Lookout view in the New Relic Explorer. If you want to see data spanning 13-months, correlations, profiles, traces, and other details, you must upgrade to a higher edition. Get started with New Relic Lookout To access New Relic Lookout, click the Apps button in New Relic One and locate the New Relic Lookout launcher. You can also access New Relic Lookout directly from the New Relic One header bar, via the More dropdown. Enablement of key service performance indicator data is required for New Relic Lookout to provide value from the data you already have. The default view provides insight into three key Service performance indicators broken down by application: throughput, response time, and errors. These metrics are analyzed to show how the data has behaved during the last five minutes compared to the prior hour. one.newrelic.com > Apps > New Relic Lookout: Anything that significantly deviates from the trend is automatically discovered by New Relic Lookout, which doesn't require any configuration. Circle visualization and table view Each application (or other facet) is represented by a circle. The size of the circles indicate the magnitude of the signal for that application and the color indicates whether the value has significantly decreased or increased in the last five minutes, based on the standard deviation of the prior hour (default evaluation and comparison time windows.) Please note that the type of signal is important when interpreting your results. When you first look at the legend below, you might be tempted to interpret yellow as good and dark purple as bad, but that is not always the case. Here are some examples: In the APM/services golden signals, a dark yellow circle in Throughput might signify that something bad has occurred and led to a drop in traffic. At the same time, a dark purple circle might also be concerning due to unexpected load. Both are significant findings worth exploring. In browser golden signals, a dark purple circle in Page Views might be great, as you are seeing more traffic to your site! With errors golden signals (in all entity types), a large circle, even if gray (not deviating from normal volume), is worth exploring because a high count of errors in your system is important to investigate. The legend allows you to change the colors used to highlight deviating services To change the color palette, click the gear icon by the low-high color legend. This allows you to change the colors used to highlight deviating services. To get a table view of the same data, click the toggle on the right. You can also hover over each color to filter the view by degree lower or higher deviance. Abnormal golden signals On the right, New Relic Lookout displays the most significantly deviating applications (or other facet) in a side panel, weighted by both the magnitude of the performance indicators and the scale of their deviations. Details include the name of the key performance indicator, their magnitude during the recent time window, and the difference between the averages from one time compared to the other. Instant search Click the magnifying glass icon in the side panel to open a search box. Typing into the search box filters the circles, table, and abnormal signals to applications (or other facets) that contain the text. This is a good way to quickly zoom to various subsystems. New Relic Lookout doesn't rerun the analysis when using the instant search. Change view Click the Change View button on the right side panel. The panel that appears shows you all the entity-specific golden signals you can toggle between out of the box. By choosing the Browser Golden Signal or other views, you can change from the default view. Each new view will have the golden signals appropriate for that entity type. Drill down into the details To analyze an application or facet, click a circle, table row, or abnormal golden signal. The details panel shows the degree of deviation of the performance indicator, a link to the affected entity, and recent alert and deployment activity for that entity, when available. There’s also an indication of whether the selected evaluation time period would be abnormal or not in reference to other comparison time windows, such as the same time yesterday or the same time last week. This allows you to quickly see if the abnormal behavior is odd in general, or just based on the comparison time window. Performance tab The default tab shows charts for other key performance indicators for the selected application or facet. The charts compare the two time windows being analyzed. You can click their titles to rerun the analysis, focusing on the selected key performance indicator. When the target is a New Relic One application, we show the top transactions, error classes, external services, and database operations, alongside links to the relevant New Relic One features. Abnormal History tab This section analyzes past performance of the selected signal and calls out any time periods with notable abnormalities. Each card represents an abnormal time window and can be clicked for more details. The charts will display any relevant violations and deployments in New Relic. Correlations tab New Relic Lookout can find other signals that began behaving differently around the same time as the selected signal for that entity type. Clicking the name of the signal reruns the analysis, focusing on that key performance indicator. The chart titles link to New Relic One when there’s an associated entity in your account. Note that correlations currently do not analyze across accounts. The correlated signals displayed are for others in the account of the original application you are viewing. This helps focus the data on correlations that are more likely related to your issue. Profile tab Based on the same technology as New Relic’s error profiles, this tab compares the last five minutes to the prior hour by default (or whatever time windows you’ve selected with query editing) and surfaces any attributes that have significantly different distributions in the events being targeted by the selected signal. For example, if a custom attribute indicated that a recent throughput spike came from one user, that would surface highly in Profiles if most of the traffic usually comes from many users. Traces tab If the entity has distributed traces configured and available in the selected evaluated time window, the Traces section is enabled. Each card shows a summary of a trace and can be clicked for details. The Explore all traces links to the distributed traces application, filtered to the selected entity. Create a custom view To target signals and time windows beyond the default values, click the Change view button and select Custom view. To create your own view: Select the account or subaccount. Select the data type (metrics or events). Different functionality is available depending on the type. In View a chart with, select the metric or event you are interested in. Default is golden signals (throughput, response time, and errors). You can also build custom queries (filters) to target a signal that isn't on the list. In Facet by, select what the circles represent. Default is appName, but you can also choose host or any other facetable attribute available for the signal you’ve selected. If you plan to save/favorite this new view, provide a name in the Name your view box. Keep in mind that you can edit this view at any time using the pencil icon. The default time windows analyzed by New Relic Lookout are the last five minutes compared to the hour before. Use the time controls (View data from and Compare data to) to target other time windows. one.newrelic.com > Apps > New Relic Lookout: All event and metric data in the New Relic database can be queried using the Edit query feature. Click Analyze to begin analyzing the signal you’ve selected. You can also create your own query: Create your query. This query is comparing data from the past thirty minutes to data from the same range a day ago. Change from Basic to Advanced after clicking the Custom view button. Select the data type (metrics or events). Different functionality is available depending on the type. Enter your query using NRQL. Please note that not all NRQL features are available in the Lookout Advanced query feature. By default, the system will run this query using the last five minutes of data compared to the previous hour. Some examples of the syntax for changing the comparison and evaluation time windows are below. Click Analyze to begin analyzing the signal you’ve selected. Query: Compare the last 15 minutes to the same time 1 day ago Please note that the UNTIL NOW portion is required here unlike in standard NRQL. Without the UNTIL NOW added, the system will query a 5 minute slice of data starting 15 minutes ago SINCE 15 minutes AGO UNTIL NOW COMPARE WITH 1 day ago Copy Query: Compare a specific time range to the same range a month ago SINCE '2021-03-07 07:00:00-0500' UNTIL '2021-03-08 07:00:00-0500' COMPARE WITH 1 month ago Copy Or: SINCE 'today at midnight' UNTIL 'now' COMPARE WITH 1 MONTH AGO Copy Example: Unusual increases in error count The default view of New Relic Lookout shows application status across your estate, comparing the last five minutes to the hour before. Under regular operation, most large systems may have a handful of abnormalities, but usually most things will indicate normal behavior. Suddenly, several circles begin to change to red under the Errors section. This indicates that several applications are experiencing unusual increases in error count. It may be that one or two circles for important systems are red, and perhaps much larger than they usually appear. Clicking one of these can provide more information on what is happening. You might see that the error rate is substantially elevated, even thousands of percent higher than normal. To troubleshoot this issue, here's what you might discover in the New Relic Lookout tabs: Performance would show you data about other signals, illuminating the characteristics of the change in system dynamics. Correlations would surface other applications that are affected and how, as well as opportunities to pivot to other applications that may be closer to the underlying causes. Traces, in turn, would show distributed traces, which can provide specific examples of traffic running through those systems. Abnormal history would show other times in the past week with elevated errors, showing whether or not this problem happens regularly, such as every day at the same time or whenever there is a deployment. Profiles might show that all or most of the new errors share common properties, such as all being isolated to just one region/account/user. Combining the information from these sections, not only can you get a sense of what is going on, but also where to focus actions to resolve the problem.",

      "body": "In the software industry, a tag typically refers to a piece of metadata added to a data set for the purpose of improving data organization and findability. At New Relic, our tags are key:value pairs (like team: operations) added to various sets of data, like monitored apps and hosts, agents, dashboards, and workloads. We make some important attributes available as tags (for example, app metadata like app name and language, and host metadata like host name and AWS region). You can also add your own custom tags. You can use tags in the UI to filter down to relevant data. Here is an example: Here you can see an accountId tag being used to filter workloads to a specific account. Tags help you to: Organize data coming from a large number of sources and/or to a large number of New Relic accounts. Identify teams, roles, environments, or regions to know who’s responsible for what (see example use cases). Better organize and search dashboards and workloads. Query and chart APM data. Tags are useful for organizing data at a high level. If you want to add more fine-grained detail, like capturing user names or other high-cardinality values, custom attributes or custom events are a better solution. Tip Tags were previously called labels in the New Relic UI. You may sometimes see labelin our code; for example, some of our APM agent config files use a label config option for tags. Tag format and limits Format requirements and limits for tags: The UI has limits on the total number of tags it can display per entity: Limit of 100 for tags reported by default or added via agent/integration configuration. Limit of 100 for custom tags added via UI or API. The following are maximum character length for tags: Key: 128 characters Value: 256 characters When using our API to add tags, a dash (-) in a tag key is interpreted as a minus symbol. If your tag key has a dash, use back ticks around it (like `key-name`). Best practices and tips Before adding tags, we recommend first seeing how our default tags work for you. When you're ready to add your own tags, review the following best practices tips to get the most out of them. Tips on keeping tags simple: Start by adding only tags you know you’ll definitely use. Unused tags create noise and may add confusion. Try to use short tags. Shorter tags are easier to parse, and also the UI may sometimes truncate longer tags. (See character limits.) When possible, use keys and values that are human-readable (for example, region: EMEA is better than Param8323 : 1229072). Avoid including several values like regions: EMEA | US | LATAM in a single tag. We recommend using three different tags for that, like region: emea, region: us, and region: latam. If you want to match multiple tags, you can do that using the advanced options in the filter UI. Tips on using tags consistently: Try to be consistent with tag language across your teams and entities. Be consistent with naming. For example, avoid using both region: emea and reg: emea. Be consistent with format. For example, avoid using both camelCase and kebab-case. Although tag searching is not case-sensitive in the UI and API, try to be consistent with capitalization. For example, avoid using both env: staging and env: Staging. Tips on cross-team implementation: Tags help improve observability and cost allocation. For this reason, responsibility for tag implementation is often assigned to an observability team, SREs, a group of architects, or a cross-team task force. We recommend the people responsible for implementing tags meet and create an internal policy to describe how the tags are defined and which conventions are to be used. Then: Keep this reference manual up to date. Automate the definition of tags when you deploy New Relic agents, at the cloud provider, or through New Relic automation tools, such as the API or Terraform. Create recurring reports that identify entities that are non-compliant with your tagging standards. Tag examples Here are some examples of common ways to use tags to organize data: Team-related tags Creating tags for team names can be helpful to understand which team, group, department, or region was responsible for a change that led to a performance issue. Team examples: team: backend team: frontend team: db Role examples: roles: architecture roles: devops roles: pm Region examples: region: emea region: america region: asia Environment-related tags You can create entities for the environment they belong to. Examples: env: production env: qa env: development env: staging Criticality-related tags You can create tags related to criticality levels, which lets you easier track the most critical issues. Examples: layer: level1 layer: level2 layer: level3 How tags are added Some important attributes, by default, are available for use as tags. For example, the account name, the account ID, and some basic host/server metadata are available as default tags. You can't remove these available-by-default tags. Here are some details about how tags are added for some specific data sources: Add tags via UI or API When you add tags via the UI or API, this occurs at the entity level. This means that, for example, if you have multiple APM agents monitoring a single entity and apply a tag via the UI, that tag is available for all data coming from that entity. To add or delete tags via the UI: Select a monitored entity, like a monitored app or host. Near the entity’s name at the top of the page, select the See metadata and manage tags menu. In the menu that pops up, add or delete a tag. For APM agents, restart your service. To manage tags via API: see our NerdGraph tagging docs. For a guide to using our CLI to automate tagging, see our developer site. APM agent tags You can add tags via the UI and API or you can add tags using APM agent configuration, both methods require you to restart your service. There are differences in how these apply tags: Via agent config: These tags are applied at the agent-level, not the entity/application level. This would be a good option if you have multiple agents monitoring different aspects of the same app (for example, a blue-green deployment model). Via the UI or API: These tags are applied at the entity/application level. Here are links to the agent configuration options: C SDK: not available Java Go .NET Node.js PHP Python Ruby For information on querying APM tags, see Query APM tags. And check out this short video on querying APM tags (3:20 minutes). Infrastructure data tags There are several ways tags are added to infrastructure entities and services: Use the UI or API to add tags at the entity level. Infrastructure agent: some attributes are available by default as tags. You can also add custom attributes, which are also available as tags in the UI. On-host integrations: some attributes are available by default as tags. You can also add tags by using integration-specific labels config options (for an example, see the labels config for the Apache integration). Cloud service integrations: by default we report tags and labels that are defined in the cloud service. To add tags, you'd add them on the cloud-service-side. Automate tags with our CLI For a guide to automating tags using our CLI tool, see our developer site. Use tags to filter the UI Use the filter field at the top of the New Relic Explorer to filter down to the entities you care about. You can use multiple filter conditions. To filter down to certain entities using tags: From one.newrelic.com, click Explorer. Click the Filter by... field to see a dropdown of available attributes and tags. You can filter by multiple elements and use advanced search options. To find an entity’s metadata and tags from the UI, here are two options: From a list of entities in the UI, at the far right, select an entity's icon. OR Select an entity. Near the top of the page, select the icon. To use the API to view tags, see our NerdGraph docs. Learn about how to use tags with dashboards and how to use tags with workloads. Custom queries, charts, and alerts Different features handle tags differently. Here are some details about how you can use NRQL to query tag data, or create NRQL condition alerts. Query and alert on APM tags You can query APM tags using NRQL. Minimum agent versions: C: not available Go: 2.3.0 Java: 4.9.0 .NET: 8.17 Node: v4.13.0 PHP: not available Python: v4.10.0.112 Ruby: 6.1.0.352 Here are some query examples: Throughput across shards Given a service that is distributed across nine shards, each shard assigned as an environment, we can plot the transaction throughput on all shards using a wildcard query like: SELECT rate(count(apm.service.transaction.duration), 1 minute) FROM Metric WHERE appName LIKE 'MyApp (%' AND transactionType = 'Other' FACET tags.Environment TIMESERIES Copy Transactions per team To see the number of transactions per service for a specific team, we might use a query like: FROM Transaction SELECT count(*) WHERE tags.Team = 'team-a' FACET tags.Project TIMESERIES Copy Alert on error rate for teams You can use a query for your services’ error rate for setting an alert without having to create a rule for each service. Here is the error rate for all services on a team called team-b. And this alert will automatically monitor any new app names added with the team tag. FROM Metric SELECT count(apm.service.error.count) / count(apm.service.transaction.duration) WHERE tags.Team = 'team-b' FACET appName Copy Related to this, you might create a general rule for a specific service deployed across several environments, so that we have an alarm for a single service monitoring each environment individually: From Metric SELECT count(apm.service.error.count) / count(apm.service.transaction.duration) WHERE tags.Project = 'MyProject' FACET tags.Environment Copy Query and alert on attributes As explained in the tag sources information, some important attributes are used as tags. You can query all attributes and create custom charts using NRQL, and create NRQL alert conditions.",

      "body": "New Relic monitoring is built around the concept of entities. In this doc, you'll learn how we define entities, what you can do with them, and how you can create your own entities or groupings of entities. What's an entity? From a New Relic perspective, entity is purposefully a broad concept. An entity is anything that a) reports data to New Relic or that contains data that we have access to, and b) is something we've identified with a unique entity ID. For most entities, the ID is indicated by the attribute entityGuid. An entity can be any fundamental data-reporting component, like an application, a host, or a database service, but it can also refer to larger groupings of those components. For example, to monitor a data center, you could aggregate those hosts in New Relic to be a workload (a custom grouping of entities). That workload is, itself, also an entity. Also very important is the relationships between entities. Our behind-the-scenes relationship-mapping helps us understand how entities are connected, how they affect each other. And this allows us to give you the power to configure how any data you're bringing in is related to existing entities, or how it's related to other entities. Our focus on entities and their relationships is important because our goal is to give you practical information about your business-important entities, and not give you an unhelpfully huge stream of data from a huge list of monitored things. With more insight at the entity level, you can better monitor and troubleshoot complex, modern systems. Find and explore entities and entity data Tip You can create new entity types for monitoring any data source. Learn more about entity synthesis. Some tips for finding and understanding entity data: To find an entity's entityGuid and entityName and other metadata: from any list of monitored entities in the New Relic Explorer, click an entity's icon, and click See metadata and tags. For most entities, its GUID is reported as the attribute entityGuid. For workloads, it's workloadGuid. You can run NRQL queries to find entities by their GUID. To see connections between entities, you have several options: When viewing an entity in the UI, use the Related entities UI. Service maps. Distributed tracing. Our NerdGraph API. To group entities together, see Group entities. Customize entity definitions and relationships. To learn technical details about entity types, see our GitHub repo. In an entity type's definition file, you'll see information like: The domain: for example, APM, or Infra. Its type: for example, Application or AWSECSCONTAINERINSTANCE. Default tags. The entityExpirationTime: how long data from that entity lasts in the UI, which is different from database data retention. Group and organize entities You can place entities into groups that reflect business-important relationships in your organization. For example, you might group all entities related to a specific team or department, or related to a specific service. Or you might group multiple hosts together to reflect their grouping in a data center. To group your entities, see: Tag entities. Create workloads, which allow you to group business-important sets of entities. Create entities and customize entity data Customize entity data with entity synthesis If you have telemetry from any source that's not supported by New Relic out of the box, you can propose a mapping for it. Once approved, any telemetry received by New Relic that matches your definition file will be synthesized into an entity. To learn more: For reserved attributes and how entity relationships are defined, keep reading this doc. For how to do the work of modifying existing entity types or creating new ones, see our GitHub repo on entity synthesis. Reserved attributes for synthesized entities These attributes are meant to be synthesized from the telemetry we receive. Do not set them unless you're aware of the implications and consequences. Attribute Description entity.guid Generally, you should not set this attribute field on your telemetry data. New Relic may add this field to ingested data to store a unique identifier for the entity associated with the data point. If telemetry arrives with the entity.guid attribute already present, then New Relic will not change the value. However, it may cause undefined behavior such as missing entities in the UI, or telemetry not associating with the expected entities. One use case for passing this attribute is to associate ingested telemetry with an entity already created by New Relic. When the entity.guid attribute is sent, the value will override New Relic’s entity identification system (such as entity synthesis definitions) and instead will use the attribute as the data. entity.name This attribute shouldn't be put on ingested telemetry data unless you're trying to override the entity name that would have been selected by New Relic’s entity identification system. While New Relic won't change the value if it's already present on the data, New Relic may add the attribute to your data. Therefore invalid or unexpected values may cause undefined behavior such as missing entities in the UI, or telemetry not associating with the expected entities. If this field is present on ingested telemetry, its value will be used to name the entity associated with the data point. This name will be used instead of the name selected by New Relic’s entity identification system (for example, entity synthesis definitions). Note that many entities use the name as part of their identification, so changing this field may result in the generation of a new entity. entity.type This attribute shouldn't be put on ingested telemetry data except for certain legacy cases where it's required to distinguish entity types. Passing this field may interfere with entity detection, particularly if unrecognized values are sent in this field. While New Relic won't change the value if already present on the data, the field is not guaranteed to provide unambiguous filtering of telemetry at query-time. Existing entity definitions already have overlapping values, and we recommend avoiding entity.type in favor of other fields for filtering telemetry queries. This field is used by New Relic, meaning that invalid or unexpected values may cause undefined behavior such as missing entities in the UI, or telemetry not associating with the expected entities. To learn how to do the work of modifying existing entity types or creating new ones, see our GitHub repo on entity synthesis. Entity relationships Connections between entities are automatically created by New Relic based on what we can infer from your telemetry. For example, when two services that communicate using HTTP are instrumented with New Relic, we infer a \"calls/called-by\" relationship between them. When viewing a specific entity in either the New Relic Explorer, Navigator, or Lookout, you can see its Related entities in the entity's mini overview. This gives a visualization of the various entities connected directly to the current entity. You can quickly view important metrics for these related entities and navigate from one entity to another, through all the connected parts of your stack. Tip Learn more about how entities are related with our NerdGraph API. When relationships are not automatically detected, you can manually create them using the \"Add/edit related entities\" link in Related entities. Important Currently, you can only manually create calls/called-by relationships between service entities. Tip To manage manual relationships, you need to have modify and delete capabilities on entity relationships. If you don’t see the edit relationships button, contact your account admin. Which relationships are created? These are the relationships created between entities: Source: New Relic agent Relationship source Relationship type Relationship target Why is the relationship created? Application instrumented with a New Relic agent CALLS Application instrumented with a New Relic agent Relationships between applications monitored by New Relic agents are reported using the DurationByCaller metric. The callee reports the metric. For example, the metric DurationByCaller/Mobile/100/1234/HTTP/all indicates that the caller is APPLICATION 1234 for account 100. Application instrumented with a New Relic agent CALLS Service instrumented with a New Relic agent An application (caller) that calls a service (callee) monitored by New Relic creates a relationship that's reported by the caller using the ExternalApp metric. For example, the metric ExternalApp/dirac.vips.net/100#1234/all indicates that the callee is APPLICATION 1234 for account 100. The metric is reported if the callee successfully responds to the caller. Service instrumented with a New Relic agent CALLS Service instrumented with a New Relic agent When a New Relic agent detects that a service (caller) calls another service (callee) instrumented by New Relic, the callee reports the metric ClientApplication. For example, the metric ClientApplication/100#1234/all indicates that the caller is APPLICATION 1234 for account 100. Service instrumented with a New Relic agent CALLS A datastore instance When an application calls a datastore instance it creates a relationship reported with the DatastoreInstance metric. For example, the metric Datastore/instance/MySQL/172.16.16.3/3306 indicates the datastore instance is vendor: MySQL, host: 172.16.16.3, port: 3306. This metric also supports the legacy datastore instance format Datastore/instance/MySQL/172.16.16.3:3306. Currently we cannot determine whether the datastore instance is instrumented by New Relic and has an entity associated to it. APM agent SERVES Browser agent This relationship is created when an APM agent injects the browser agent into a page. Workload entity CONTAINS Any entity When a workload is created or updated, relationships for each of the entities that belong to the workload are created. Because some workloads are “dynamic” (defined by tags), relationships are re-created every 5 minutes. This way entities can join or leave the workload. Source: Infrastructure Relationship source Relationship type Relationship target Why is the relationship created? Infrastructure host HOSTS Application This relationship is created when an application is running in one or more hosts, and the infra agent is running in those hosts. Infrastructure host HOSTS Container This relationship is created when containers are running in one or more hosts, and the host is instrumented with the infra agent. Source: Synthetics monitor Relationship source Relationship type Relationship target Why is the relationship created? Synthetics Monitor CALLS Browser agent This relationship is created when a synthetics monitor checks a page instrumented with the browser agent. Synthetics Monitor CALLS APM application Agent events that contain the attribute nr.syntheticsMonitorId have been described as synthetics monitors (the source) interacting with an APM application (the target). If the header exists and the APM application Id exists, a relationship is created between the monitor and the app. Source: Kubernetes Relationship source Relationship type Relationship target Why is the relationship created? Cluster CONTAINS Pod This relationship is created when a pod is created in a cluster instrumented with the New Relic Kubernetes integration. Cluster CONTAINS Deployment This relationship is created when a deployment is created in a cluster instrumented with the New Relic Kubernetes integration. Cluster CONTAINS DaemonSet This relationship is created when a DaemonSet is created in a cluster instrumented with the New Relic Kubernetes integration. Cluster CONTAINS StatefulSet This relationship is created when a StatefulSet is created in a cluster instrumented with the New Relic Kubernetes integration. Cluster CONTAINS Host This relationship is created when a host that's part of a cluster is instrumented with the New Relic Kubernetes integration. Deployment CONTAINS Pod This relationship is created when a deployment creates a pod in a cluster instrumented with the New Relic Kubernetes integration. DaemonSet CONTAINS Pod This relationship is created when a DaemonSet is created a pod in a cluster instrumented with the New Relic Kubernetes integration. StatefulSet CONTAINS Pod This relationship is created when a StatefulSet creates a pod in a cluster instrumented with the New Relic Kubernetes integration. Pod CONTAINS Container This relationship is created when a pod creates a container in a cluster instrumented with the New Relic Kubernetes integration. Host HOSTS Pod This relationship is created when a pod is running in a host that's part of a cluster instrumented with the New Relic Kubernetes integration. Container HOSTS Application This relationship is created when an application is running in docker, and the hosts where docker is running are instrumented by the the infra agent. External services Relationship source Relationship type Relationship target Why is the relationship created? External service CALLS External service When the relationship is created, the external service reports a span with its name on the service.name attribute and the name of the service that initiates the call in the parent.service.name attribute. Application IS External service A relationship between an application and an external service is created so that users can navigate between them using the related entities component. Browser application instrumented with a New Relic agent CALLS External service A browser application reports an Ajax/HostTransaction metric when calling an external service (URL). Example metric: Ajax/HostTransaction/api.segment.io:443/CallbackTime' Cluster CONTAINS External service When the relationship is created, the external service reports a span with the attribute k8s.cluster.name, the name of the cluster. The cluster must be instrumented with the New Relic Kubernetes integration and the cluster name set for the integration must match the one reported in the span. Pod HOSTS External service When the relationship is created, the external service reports a span with the following attributes: service.name: The name of the service. k8s.cluster.name: The name of the cluster. k8s.pod.name: The name of the pod that’s running the service. k8s.namespace.name: The namespace where the pod was created. The cluster must be instrumented with the New Relic Kubernetes integration and the cluster name set for the integration must match the one reported in the span. Create relationships manually You can create additional relationships using NerdGraph, our GraphQL API. Relationships can be created or replaced using the mutation entityRelationshipUserDefinedCreateOrReplace. As its name suggests, it allows you to create a relationship between two entities with a given type. If the relationship already exists between the two entities, it will be added again with the updated given values: the creation time and the creator user id: mutation { entityRelationshipUserDefinedCreateOrReplace( sourceEntityGuid: \"{SourceEntityGuid}\" targetEntityGuid: \"{TargetEntityGuid}\" type: BUILT_FROM ) { errors { message type } } } Copy Delete relationships using the mutation entityRelationshipUserDefinedDelete. source and target are mandatory, whereas type isn't. If the mutation its executed without any type, all the relationships between the two entities will be removed. mutation { entityRelationshipUserDefinedDelete( sourceEntityGuid: \"{SourceEntityGuid}\" targetEntityGuid: \"{TargetEntityGuid}\" type: BUILT_FROM ) { errors { message type } } } Copy Find information about fetching relationships in the relationships API tutorial. Some considerations Two entities can have multiple relationships, one for each relationship type. Two entities can hold a relationship IF they belong to the same trusted account. For each entity, you can manually define up to 2000 relationships. When the limit is reached, the API will return a LIMIT_EXCEEDED error. Each mutation can fail if you don't have access to one of the two entities (source/target). Relationship types provide additional information about how two entities are related. The supported relationship types are: Relationship types Type Description CALLS The relationship between one service or application calling another. Used to display upstream and downstream services. CONTAINS The relationship and hierarchical use cases common to modern and cloud infrastructure. For example, this could indicate that the HOST contains a container. HOSTS The relationship between an application or process and the system it runs on. SERVES The relationship between a back-end application and the browser application it returns in the response. is The relationship between an entity captured as a separate entity by another telemetry data source and the one you're currently viewing. CONNECTS_TO The source entity has a connection to the target entity. BUILT_FROM The target entity contains the code for the source entity.",

Tip This doc gives you detailed information about why APM matters to your business. But if you want to skip ahead, just sign up for a New Relic account. (It's free, forever!) Then, after you install the agent, you can start working with your data. Ready to get started? Start benefiting from APM in five simple steps (and just a few minutes!). Sign up for a New Relic account (it's free, forever!). Install and customize the language agent for your app. Generate some traffic for your app. Wait a few minutes for New Relic to start receiving your data. Log in to your account, and start exploring New Relic! Use the Explorer in New Relic One to access and observe the full stack of your software, including your apps, see performance data and alerting status at a glance, and check relationships. We provide you with a simple, yet powerful visual tool to monitor all your entities, that is, anything we can identify that reports data. In the New Relic ecosystem, entities include basic components like applications, hosts, containers, or database services, but it can also refer to custom groupings of such elements. You can also create your own entities. If data does not appear after waiting a few minutes, follow the troubleshooting tips for your APM agent. Identify problems before your users do Our APM agents report and store the state of your application so you can quickly identify potential problems before they affect your end users. With APM, your DevOps teams don't need to guess whether a performance blocker comes from the app itself, CPU availability, database loads, or something entirely unexpected. Use our APM solutions to gather both current and historical information about memory usage, CPU utilization, database query performance, web browser rendering performance, app availability, error analysis, external services, and other useful metrics. Monitor all aspects of your business Take advantage of these APM features, and more: Features Description App performance at a glance When you sign in to APM and select an app for your account, use the Summary page to quickly examine relationships across different aspects of your environment; for example: Web transactions response time: Where is the most time being spent? In the request queue, during different stages of page rendering and execution, from external services, or something else? Transaction traces: Which transactions are the slowest, and why? Error rate and throughput: What relationship is there between a spike in errors or slower throughput for a particular time period? Was there a deployment or outage at that time? Hosts: What kind of impact does this have on CPU usage, memory, etc.? Apdex: How are these events affecting customers' satisfaction with the site? Web and non-web transactions Start by comparing the top twenty web transactions or non-web transactions in terms of most time consuming, slowest average response time, highest throughput, or worst Apdex. From there, drill down into deeper trace levels for individual transactions, which in turn break down into smaller segments and components, from HTTPS requests on down to SQL queries. Want to explore even deeper? Set up distributed tracing to see how requests move across a distributed system. Select the transactions that are most important to your business (key transactions). APM and Infrastructure When your APM and Infrastructure accounts are linked, you will have access to APM data charts on these Infrastructure UI pages: Hosts, Network, Storage, and Processes. Distributed tracing Distributed tracing gives you visibility across distributed systems, showing you the path of a request as it travels between services. This feature is especially valuable for large, distributed systems that rely on many small services and microservices. Logs Bring your logs and application's data together to make troubleshooting easier and faster. With logs in context, you can see log messages related to your errors and traces directly in your app's UI. You can also see logs in context of your infrastructure data, such as Kubernetes clusters. No need to switch to another UI page in New Relic One. Service maps APM's service maps show your app's connections and dependencies, including databases and external services. Health indicators and performance metrics show you the current operational status for every part of your architecture. You can create and customize service maps to visualize and monitor your complex architectures. Query your data You can query and visualize your data: Sample and search APM transaction and error data to gain full understanding of the data being collected. Browse your data visually with the data explorer. Create custom SQL-like queries of your data using the New Relic Query Language (NRQL), or using our PromQL-style queries. Use dashboards to build advanced data visualizations, contextualize data, and understand what's going on in your system, real-time. These are just a few of APM's features.

      "body": "New Relic One has some basic UI functions that are widely available across the platform. Understanding these features will help you find and analyze your data more easily. Observe your platform New Relic One gives you full access to the data from all the entities in your stack. Go to the New Relic Explorer at one.newrelic.com to see a full list of entities, identify overall behaviors, filter them to locate sources of performance issues, or plan improvements for your system. Customize the navigation bar and shortcuts Select the edit icon at the right end of the navigation bar to customize your view. Home, Explorer, Browse data, Dashboards, and Alerts & AI are fixed, but you can favorite up to six more elements to display on the bar as well. The rest will go on the More group. Navigation shortcuts are a faster way to find entities and apps that are relevant to you. Mouse over any menu item for quick access to your favorite entities, those you recently visited, or just to search without having to navigate to a specific section. If you click on an entity, you can choose to open it in the same browser tab or in a new one. Light and dark mode See Light and dark mode. Search accounts and entities Access Quick find clicking the button, near the top right of the New Relic One UI. Some details about your search: You can search across all accounts that you have been granted access to in your organization. For more about account access, see Factors affecting access. Entities that cease to exist are available in search for eight days. If your organization has multiple accounts, use the account picker at the top left corner to select accounts. Chart and query features You can add most charts to a new or existing dashboard. Here are some query and chart features available across all or most of the platform: If you want to... Do this... Start querying your data Mouse over Browse data and select metrics, events, logs, or traces for a direct access to any of those types of data. Also, at the top of any UI page, select Query your data to access the data explorer and query builder. View a chart's query For some charts, you can view the NRQL query used to generate that chart. This can help you understand a chart better or use it as the basis for a new query. Choose time range Drag across a section of a chart to zoom in on that time range. Or, use the time picker in the top right corner of the UI to select pre-set time ranges or set a custom one. View chart details Mouse over a chart to see a pop-up with more detail. For some charts, selecting a point on the chart will take you to a UI page with more information about that metric. Hide or return chart elements To hide or unhide a displayed chart element, select that element's name below the chart. The chart display will adjust to reflect the absence or presence of that element. Share New Relic views with others Here are some options for sharing New Relic UI pages and visualizations. If you want to... Do this... Share UI pages and dashboards To share an entire New Relic UI page, click Share near the top of the UI to copy the URL. Share charts If New Relic charts are built with NRQL queries, they have a menu that exposes various options, including sharing options like Get as image and Get chart link. Some notes about sharing: The person you share with may not have access to view the data from that account. To solve that, someone on your team with New Relic user management abilities must add that person to the account. If someone can't access a custom dashboard, it may be that it is set to private. Read more about dashboard permissions. Some sharing options have associated time ranges, which may impact later viewings of it. For example, if you use a chart's Get chart link option and that chart is set to 'Last 30 minutes', when viewed it will show the last 30 minutes, not the time range displayed when it was shared. To share a specific time range, you must select that time range in the UI. Account and user settings To find account settings and user preferences, use the account dropdown, located at the top right of the UI, beside your user name. Other UI experiences This has been a look at a few basic platform UI experiences. For more about the UI, search for docs related to the specific New Relic solution you're using.",

      "body": "Important This feature is currently in an EAP. Our November 2021 relaunch of the infrastructure monitoring tools adds consistency to the way our users interact with the New Relic One platform. Previously, when clicking on the infrastructure item in the top navigation bar, you were redirected outside the Explorer, missing capabilities like the Navigator and Lookout. Now, by clicking on infrastructure or hosts, you are directed to the list of all of our host entities in the list view of Explorer, and infrastructure events are displayed in the activity stream. Our inventory experience has not changed as part of this release. Tip Use the toggle in the UI to access the legacy interface. While we have worked to update the flow and visualizations around your key infrastructure data, we have not removed any of the previous functionality in order to give you time to adjust to the new tools. You can still access the hosts legacy view from the top infrastructure nav drop down. Ready to get started? Make sure you have a New Relic account. It's free, forever! Access the new infrastructure UI Check out the new infrastructure monitoring: Go to one.newrelic.com, click on Infrastructure on the top nav bar, then select Hosts (New). Or go to the Explorer and select Hosts. The infrastructure Explorer list view is organized in these panels: Your system's entities on the left. Estate View panel in the middle. It provides the ability to select up to 25 entities at a time to analyze together: Select the hosts you want to observe, and hit the View Selected button to navigate to the new analysis nerdlet. From the list view you can still jump directly to an individual entity summary by clicking on the entity name in the list. Activity stream on the right. Entities are displayed based on golden metrics The new entity list is powered by golden metrics, which you are starting to see throughout New Relic. You will see the same set of metrics if you select to view Lookout for these infrastructure entity types. These new metrics replace the previous summary metrics in the old UI. Views with improved sorting and filtering We have removed the limitation of fewer than 2,000 entities to sort column values. Note that performance may be slightly impacted if there are more than 10,000 entities. On top of sorting, you can also filter the entities' metric values to hone in on exactly the entities that need your attention. For example, you can now filter only to entities that have a CPU over 80% so you can quickly identify if there are problems in their estate. Filtering is limited to one column for the moment, but it will be extended to multiple columns in future releases. A new nerdlet provides deep infrastructure analysis Once you've selected the desired entities in the entity list view, upon clicking View Selected, a slide out analysis panel appears regarding that set of entities. There are three panels of data: Left panel: Selected entities list Toggle between these entities' key metrics on the top drop down. Hover over any entity row to view more details on the entity. Click View Logs to open a new tab with their logs in context information. For hosts only, use the map icon to launch the auto-map feature for a particular host entity. This view gives you a visual representation of your host’s relationships to other entities in the stack. Select the magnifying glass icon labeled View summary to be redirected to the summary page for that individual entity. If you select an entity in the left panel, the line for that entity will also be highlighted on each chart. Hide the entity from the list clicking on the eye icon. If you chose to hide entities in the left panel, those will be removed from the charts in the middle panel. Middle panel: Golden metrics comparison charts The golden metrics comparison charts represent the golden metrics signals for the selected entities. If you chose to hide entities in the left panel, they will be removed from the charts. If an entity is highlighted in the left panel, the line for that entity will also be highlighted on each chart. Or, if you highlight a line, the entity is also highlighted on the left. Data points on each chart have a tooltip with details. Right panel: Related entities Understanding relationships in New Relic can be complicated, but very powerful when trying to solve problems. Imagine a host is misbehaving and you’d like to know, without a lot of clicking, what else it might be affecting. The related entities panel seeks to show you those entities that are related to your selection on the left panel so you can see common golden signals on those entities. See at a glance if your connected APM service is experiencing a slow response time, decreased throughput or an elevated error rate! When you first enter the new view, you will see the related entities panel sorted by the alert status of those entities. If there's a service with a critical violation, it will be right at the top! If you hover on an entity in the left panel, the related entities associated with the item will be highlighted on the right. Additionally, if you click on the item in the left side, the right panel will re-sort to bump the associated related entities to the top of the column on the right.",

APM supports apps for several programming languages, including Go, Java, .NET, Node.js, PHP, Python, and Ruby, as well as a C SDK. View the status of all your services at a glance with APM. Tip This doc gives you detailed information about why APM matters to your business. But if you want to skip ahead, just sign up for a New Relic account. (It's free, forever!) Then, after you install the agent, you can start working with your data. Ready to get started? Start benefiting from APM in five simple steps (and just a few minutes!). Sign up for a New Relic account (it's free, forever!). Install and customize the language agent for your app. Generate some traffic for your app. Wait a few minutes for New Relic to start receiving your data. Log in to your account, and start exploring New Relic! Use the Explorer in New Relic One to access and observe the full stack of your software, including your apps, see performance data and alerting status at a glance, and check relationships. We provide you with a simple, yet powerful visual tool to monitor all your entities, that is, anything we can identify that reports data. In the New Relic ecosystem, entities include basic components like applications, hosts, containers, or database services, but it can also refer to custom groupings of such elements. You can also create your own entities. If data does not appear after waiting a few minutes, follow the troubleshooting tips for your APM agent. Identify problems before your users do Our APM agents report and store the state of your application so you can quickly identify potential problems before they affect your end users. With APM, your DevOps teams don't need to guess whether a performance blocker comes from the app itself, CPU availability, database loads, or something entirely unexpected. Use our APM solutions to gather both current and historical information about memory usage, CPU utilization, database query performance, web browser rendering performance, app availability, error analysis, external services, and other useful metrics. Monitor all aspects of your business Take advantage of these APM features, and more: Features Description App performance at a glance When you sign in to APM and select an app for your account, use the Summary page to quickly examine relationships across different aspects of your environment; for example: Web transactions response time: Where is the most time being spent? In the request queue, during different stages of page rendering and execution, from external services, or something else? Transaction traces: Which transactions are the slowest, and why? Error rate and throughput: What relationship is there between a spike in errors or slower throughput for a particular time period? Was there a deployment or outage at that time? Hosts: What kind of impact does this have on CPU usage, memory, etc.? Apdex: How are these events affecting customers' satisfaction with the site? Web and non-web transactions Start by comparing the top twenty web transactions or non-web transactions in terms of most time consuming, slowest average response time, highest throughput, or worst Apdex. From there, drill down into deeper trace levels for individual transactions, which in turn break down into smaller segments and components, from HTTPS requests on down to SQL queries. Want to explore even deeper? Set up distributed tracing to see how requests move across a distributed system. Select the transactions that are most important to your business (key transactions). APM and Infrastructure When your APM and Infrastructure accounts are linked, you will have access to APM data charts on these Infrastructure UI pages: Hosts, Network, Storage, and Processes. Distributed tracing Distributed tracing gives you visibility across distributed systems, showing you the path of a request as it travels between services. This feature is especially valuable for large, distributed systems that rely on many small services and microservices. Logs Bring your logs and application's data together to make troubleshooting easier and faster. With logs in context, you can see log messages related to your errors and traces directly in your app's UI. You can also see logs in context of your infrastructure data, such as Kubernetes clusters. No need to switch to another UI page in New Relic One. Service maps APM's service maps show your app's connections and dependencies, including databases and external services. Health indicators and performance metrics show you the current operational status for every part of your architecture. You can create and customize service maps to visualize and monitor your complex architectures. Query your data You can query and visualize your data: Sample and search APM transaction and error data to gain full understanding of the data being collected. Browse your data visually with the data explorer. Create custom SQL-like queries of your data using the New Relic Query Language (NRQL), or using our PromQL-style queries. Use dashboards to build advanced data visualizations, contextualize data, and understand what's going on in your system, real-time. These are just a few of APM's features.

      "body": "The New Relic automap feature displays entity-centric maps to help you troubleshoot incidents that cascade through interconnected services. With automap, you can pinpoint when and where an issue began by viewing the dependencies that affect your services. To use automap, you need a New Relic account. If you don't already have one, you can sign up here for a free account. Here's an example of where you could start troubleshooting with automap. How it works New Relic automap displays relationships between entities in your architecture. For version 1, the relationships displayed in automap are based on direct calls between services. For example, APM services are represented as vertices (hexagons) and direct calls are represented as edges (lines) on the graph. This shows you how these services depend on one another. Automap displays only the entities related to the source entity that have experienced a change in health status within three hours after the automap was launched. So, it may not show all entities related to the source entity. To understand entities and relationships, as well as how the entity platform synthesizes both from telemetry data, see entities and relationships. Important Automap auto-expand logic relies on the health status of an entity, which is largely determined by the alert status of that entity. For optimal troubleshooting with automap, ensure that your alerts are properly configured. Open automap Automap appears on any Related entities pane for supported entity types: In Explorer, insert a filter to find your entity/service (for example, alerts). Click on the entity/service. On the Summary page, go to Related entities in the right pane. Click Map view: The Map view button is only available for the following types of entities: Entity type Description Icon APM|APPLICATION Application service instrumented with a New Relic APM agent BROWSER|APPLICATION Browser application instrumented with New Relic Browser agent EXT|SERVICE Services instrumented with OpenTelemetry, including Pixie-instrumented services MOBILE|APPLICATION Mobile app instrumented with a New Relic agent NR1|WORKLOAD Workload SYNTH|MONITOR Synthetic monitor Explore the history Unlike simple navigation maps, such as New Relic maps in context, automap helps you understand how problems developed by allowing you to scroll backwards and forwards in time. You can also screen out entities you're not interested in. Timewarp cursor: go back in time To identify exactly when and where an incident originated, simply move the Timewarp cursor to see health status changes for the entities on the map. If you don't see the Timewarp cursor, click the clock icon in the upper-right of the automap. When you scroll through the history, you see when anomalous behavior was detected by New Relic Lookout. Here’s an example of scrolling that reveals that the issue occurred between FulfillmentService and BillingService: Controls: See only what you need to see With the controls menu available below the Timewarp cursor, you can de-emphasize certain entities on the map by unchecking those options. For example, you can hide the healthy service to focus only on those alerting as you browse the timeline: Here is an example of how the controls work: Map symbols Here's a table showing the various health status icons: Health status Icon Critical Warning Not alerting Not configured Anomaly",

Observe your platform New Relic One gives you full access to the data from all the entities in your stack. Go to the New Relic Explorer at one.newrelic.com to see a full list of entities, identify overall behaviors, filter them to locate sources of performance issues, or plan improvements for your system. Customize the navigation bar and shortcuts Select the edit icon at the right end of the navigation bar to customize your view. Home, Explorer, Browse data, Dashboards, and Alerts & AI are fixed, but you can favorite up to six more elements to display on the bar as well. The rest will go on the More group. Navigation shortcuts are a faster way to find entities and apps that are relevant to you. Mouse over any menu item for quick access to your favorite entities, those you recently visited, or just to search without having to navigate to a specific section. If you click on an entity, you can choose to open it in the same browser tab or in a new one. Light and dark mode See Light and dark mode. Search accounts and entities Access Quick find clicking the button, near the top right of the New Relic One UI. Some details about your search: You can search across all accounts that you have been granted access to in your organization. For more about account access, see Factors affecting access. Entities that cease to exist are available in search for eight days. If your organization has multiple accounts, use the account picker at the top left corner to select accounts. Chart and query features You can add most charts to a new or existing dashboard. Here are some query and chart features available across all or most of the platform: If you want to... Do this... Start querying your data Mouse over Browse data and select metrics, events, logs, or traces for a direct access to any of those types of data. Also, at the top of any UI page, select Query your data to access the data explorer and query builder. View a chart's query For some charts, you can view the NRQL query used to generate that chart. This can help you understand a chart better or use it as the basis for a new query. Choose time range Drag across a section of a chart to zoom in on that time range. Or, use the time picker in the top right corner of the UI to select pre-set time ranges or set a custom one. View chart details Mouse over a chart to see a pop-up with more detail. For some charts, selecting a point on the chart will take you to a UI page with more information about that metric. Hide or return chart elements To hide or unhide a displayed chart element, select that element's name below the chart. The chart display will adjust to reflect the absence or presence of that element. Share New Relic views with others Here are some options for sharing New Relic UI pages and visualizations. If you want to... Do this... Share UI pages and dashboards To share an entire New Relic UI page, click Share near the top of the UI to copy the URL. Share charts If New Relic charts are built with NRQL queries, they have a menu that exposes various options, including sharing options like Get as image and Get chart link. Some notes about sharing: The person you share with may not have access to view the data from that account. To solve that, someone on your team with New Relic user management abilities must add that person to the account. If someone can't access a custom dashboard, it may be that it is set to private. Read more about dashboard permissions. Some sharing options have associated time ranges, which may impact later viewings of it. For example, if you use a chart's Get chart link option and that chart is set to 'Last 30 minutes', when viewed it will show the last 30 minutes, not the time range displayed when it was shared. To share a specific time range, you must select that time range in the UI. Account and user settings To find account settings and user preferences, use the account dropdown, located at the top right of the UI, beside your user name. Other UI experiences This has been a look at a few basic platform UI experiences. For more about the UI, search for docs related to the specific New Relic solution you're using.",

      "body": "There may be cases where an application sends many individual metrics that could be better managed in groups. Most of these occur with web transactions metrics named from URLs. For more information on this issue, see Metric grouping issues (MGIs). To reduce high cardinality and prevent metric grouping issues, New Relic supports rules for grouping or filtering out metrics (normalization). In some cases, when MGIs with a significant high number of metrics are detected, a rule is created automatically to protect the platform from performance degradation. Metric normalization rules management You can create and manage new rules that deal with the noise produced from high cardinality metrics by using the metric normalization tool, which is accessible from each service dashboard in the New Relic Explorer. Once there, select Metric Normalization in the left sidebar. There you can see the existing rules or create new ones. Click a rule to modify it, or click Create a new rule to create a new one. A new pane to configure the rule will be displayed. Available fields are: Match expression: enter the regular expression to group all the metrics you want to include in the rule. Matches: here you will see a preview of the metrics matched by the regular expression above. Action: the action you want to perform on the metrics. Replace: replace the matched metrics by the regular expression with the value described in the Replacement field. Ignore: ignore any metric that matches the regular expression. Deny new metrics: only write metrics that have already been reported, and ignore those that match the regular expression. Replacement: only active when Replace is enabled. Matched metrics are replaced with the field's value. If the regular expression is capturing groups, you can use placeholders for them with \\1 or \\2 for the groups 1 and 2 respectively. Active: rules can’t be deleted, but can be deactivated. Click the toggle to enable or disable the rule. If you want the rule to be removed, reach out to New Relic's support. Terminate: When enabled, the rules waterfall is exited when the associated pattern is matched. Notes: internal notes on the rule. Has no effect on the rule.

      "body": "Here is information about using the legacy APM service maps feature to create, customize, and use service maps. For help using the current service maps feature, see How to use service maps. Requirements The legacy service map features in APM depend on your New Relic agent version: Feature Requirements App visibility For your app to appear in service maps, one of the following must be true: Your app must have the minimum agent version required for distributed tracing and have distributed tracing enabled. Note: Mobile monitoring doesn't support distributed tracing yet and will not show relationships to apps that have distributed tracing enabled. Your app must have the minimum APM agent version required for cross app tracing and have cross app tracing enabled. Host and instance visibility To view specific hosts, instances, and types of database information, your agent must meet the same minimum agent versions as the APM database and instance feature and use any of the compatible database drivers. Database-only visibility APM's service maps feature includes the ability to opt out of the deeper, host and instance level view. However, to view databases in service maps without the instance-level details, you must still meet the same minimum agent versions as the Database and slow queries features. Create maps The APM service maps feature helps you create your first map by providing default map or architecture suggestions that automatically build a default map (if you have more than ten reporting apps). To view these suggested maps, go to one.newrelic.com > More > Service Maps > Suggested maps. To create a new map: Do one of the following: Start from scratch: Go to one.newrelic.com > More > Service maps > Map list > Create new map . Copy an existing map: Go to one.newrelic.com > More > Service maps > (select a map) > Save as new. Name your map. Rearrange, group, or add nodes on the map as needed. Important Previously, you could have private service maps. Now, all users can view, edit, and delete all existing or new service maps in the account. Save and rename maps Here are some tips about saving and renaming maps: Save To save changes to a map, select Save. To create a copy of the current map, select Save as new. Rename To rename a map: Go to one.newrelic.com > More > Service maps > (select a map). Select the pencil icon next to the map name. Change the name, then select Save. Add or remove nodes on maps After you create or save a map, build out your map by adding nodes to it. Nodes are added to the map differently based on the node type. To remove any node from the map, mouse over the node, then select the remove X icon. Applications and mobile apps Nodes for applications or mobile apps need to be added to the map in order to add any other nodes. Nodes are added and connected into the map as you select them. The check mark icon means that node is already on the map. To add apps to the map: Go to one.newrelic.com > More > Service maps > (select a map) > App/Service. Select any applications from the App/Service list. Rearrange or group together as needed. Browser, databases, external services, connected apps In the New Relic UI, your out-of-process services are referred to as web external or background external data. To add browser apps, databases, external services, or other connected apps to the map: Select an incoming or outgoing connection widget. From the list of connections, mouse over an app or service, then select the plus icon. Rearrange as needed. Custom nodes To add a custom node to the map: Go to one.newrelic.com > More > Service maps > (select a map) > App/Service. From the App/Service list, select Create custom node. Name the node. Add connections: Select the left (for incoming) or right (for outgoing) arrow icons. Then select the plus icon on your target node. Select Save. Rearrange as needed. To add or remove custom node connections: Mouse over the custom node and select the pencil icon. Select the left (for incoming) or right (for outgoing) arrow icons. To add a connection, select the plus icon. To remove a connection, select the minus icon. Select Save. Move around the map Move around the map by panning or zooming in and out. If you want to... Do this... Pan the map In pan mode, click and drag. In drag-select mode, hold the Alt key, then click and drag. Zoom in and out In either mode, zoom in and out by scrolling the mouse wheel. View your entire map in traffic light mode Zoom out until node details fade out and are replaced by health status colors. Toggle the traffic light view on and off Select Views, then select Traffic light mode. View all the nodes and their dependencies Select Discover your environment. Drill down into more detail from a node Use standard UI functions. Select, arrange, group nodes Click on a node to select it and view its performance summary. You can also select multiple nodes at once, to group and ungroup them: Select nodes To select one node, click on the node. To select multiple nodes: Click the drag-select icon to switch to drag-select mode. Click and drag the mouse to draw a square around the nodes you want to select. OR Hold the Shift key and click on each node you want to select. Arrange nodes Caution Auto-arrange cannot be undone. Consider saving a copy of your map first. To arrange nodes on the map, select one or more node, then drag to a snap point on the map. To automatically organize all your nodes and connections, select Auto-arrange map. Group and ungroup nodes If you want to... Do this... Group nodes together on the map Select two or more nodes, then select Create group. Name your new group Mouse over the group, then select the pencil icon. Rename an existing group Select the pencil icon. Remove nodes from a group Select the group, then select the minus icon for each item you want to remove. Add maps and charts to dashboards one.newrelic.com > Dashboards: adding a service map to a dashboard provides context for the data being reported and where it's coming from. You can add legacy service maps to a dashboard. For example, if you have a dashboard showcasing performance metrics for several entities, adding a service map to the dashboard shows how all the entities are related and provides additional context about your system. To add a service map to a dashboard: Go to one.newrelic.com and select the Explorer. Select an entity from the index. Click on Service map. Click Add to dashboard. Search for the dashboard you want to add the map to. Delete maps To delete a map: Go to one.newrelic.com > More > Service maps > (select a map). Select the map name's pencil icon. Select Delete map. Identify issues with external services If your app connects to an external service that New Relic does not monitor (for example, a third-party API), New Relic watches the service for a week in order to baseline its response time. If New Relic can collect a statistically significant number of data points (more than 100), New Relic compares the current response time to this baseline and uses this to set the health status indicator: Green: Response time from the service is less than 1.75 times the baseline. Yellow: Response time from the service is longer than 1.75 times the baseline. Red: Response time from the service is longer than 2.5 times the baseline. Gray: Alerts concluded it does not have enough data to determine the health status. Purple: Alerts cannot yet conclude if it has enough data to determine the health status. Visualize and monitor complex architectures Use service maps to visualize and monitor complex architectures. For a tutorial introducing the latest features, select the service map's question icon. Nodes Nodes are the basic building blocks for your map. You can add a variety of node types including: Node type Description New Relic APM-monitored app Add your app to the map to view their connections to databases, browser apps, out-of-process services, and other instrumented apps. (In the New Relic UI, your out-of-process services are also referred to as web external or background external data.) Browser apps Automatically detected for each app and added via the incoming connections widget. Only displays browser apps linked to an APM app (standalone browser apps are not supported). New Relic mobile monitoring apps Automatically detected and added via the app/service list panel. External services Service maps automatically detects external services (visible in the connections widget), to track your app's external dependencies and monitor the health of those connections. Custom nodes Add custom nodes via the app/service list panel to include apps and services not automatically instrumented by New Relic (for example, load balancers, implementation planning, and so on). Group nodes A group node contains multiple other nodes. For apps, group nodes include a summarized health status indicator for all nodes in the group. Node arrangement and grouping Click and drag a node to move it around the map, for a customizable view of your architecture. App nodes can also be grouped together into a single node to better organize related apps and services. Grouped nodes include summarized health status indicator for all nodes in the group. To remove items from a group, mouse over the group and select the pencil pencil icon, then select the minus minus-circle icon to remove the item from the group. Incoming and outgoing connections Service maps automatically detects incoming and outgoing connections based on HTTP calls between entities. Mouse over a node to highlight the node's connections. Widgets at the end of each node display a count of that node's connections, and you can click on those widgets to add related entities to the map: View performance summary Click on an app to view its performance over the last 30 minutes. The chart defaults to Response time, but you can view other metrics by selecting any of the available Apdex, Throughput, or Error rate links. While charts use the last 30 minutes of performance data, the service map as a whole is based on the last five minutes. View the app in APM or browser and view its labels by selecting the overflow ellipsis-v icon. Click the app name again to hide the summary charts, and select the overflow ellipsis-h icon again to hide other details. Map list and app/service list panels Select the Map list panel to: Search for and view your maps, and access other users' shared maps. Create a new map. Select the App/Service List panel to: Add new apps and mobile apps to your map. Create custom nodes and add them to the map. Health status and performance metrics You can see health status indicators for most nodes. Except for out-of-process services (external services or background services), entities use the health status indicators used by New Relic Alerts. For out-of-process (external) services, the health status indicator measures the health of the connection to the external service. View all connected apps and services The Discover your environment feature allows you to view all of your apps, services, and dependencies together with a single click. This feature detects all connected applications and services (including externals and databases) to give you a comprehensive view of your overall software architecture environment. To view all connected apps and services: In APM, select Service maps. From your Map list, select Discover your environment to display all of your nodes. Hover over any node to view its dependencies and how it connects to other parts of your service map. Click on individual nodes to zoom in and view their details. The Discover your environment feature may not be available if you are using an older New Relic agent version. See Troubleshooting cross application tracing for version information. This feature may also not be available for highly complex service maps with many elements. Go to one.newrelic.com > More > Service maps > Map list > Discover your environment: Use this option to view all of your nodes and their dependencies in one place. Traffic light mode Traffic light mode lets you view the health status of your entire architecture at a glance. This feature helps you quickly find service and app problems, even within a complex environment with many nodes. To toggle this mode, select the Views tab, then select Traffic light mode. When traffic lights mode is On, zooming out far enough on a service map eventually causes the nodes to switch from displaying textual information, to only health status colors. Click on individual nodes to zoom in and view more details. Traffic light mode is on by default. When traffic lights mode is Off, service map nodes retain their textual information and do not switch to health status colors, No matter how far you zoom out. one.newrelic.com > More > Service maps > Views > Traffic light mode: When traffic light mode is enabled, zooming out of your service map displays nodes in health status colors. Midnight mode Midnight mode inverts the screen's colors, going from a white background to a dark background. Midnight mode reduces eye strain, especially in low light environments. To toggle this mode, select the Views tab, then select Midnight mode.",

Access service maps Two options are available in New Relic One: the current service maps and the legacy APM service maps. To access the different service maps: Type To view maps Purpose Current service maps Go to one.newrelic.com > Explorer > (select an entity) > Monitor > Service map Service maps give you increased access to all the entities across your accounts, and help you understand how your entire environment is connected. Legacy APM service maps Go to one.newrelic.com > More > Service maps Legacy APM service maps let you create, customize, and share maps related to an individual app. Identify operational issues Service maps are color-coded to provide a quick look at the current status of your environment. Select nodes on a map to view additional performance metrics, and a full list and health check of each node's connections. The map automatically connects nodes into the map, so you can see which apps on the map connect to others. This helps you troubleshoot and assess the impact of a performance problem between a calling application and a specific database. With service maps, you can view your service and its status in the context of its up and downstream dependencies.

      "body": "Problem When using service maps, you can't view the full set of entities or the relationships between entities that you expect to see. Solution Make sure that the entities are being monitored with an agent. If you have a mix of agents with some having distributed tracing turned on and some having it turned off, you will not see the relations between those agents. The solution for this scenario is to run all agents either with distributed tracing turned on (preferred) or turn it off for all agents. If this does not remedy the issue, the service you're trying to view may require manual instrumentation. When you view applications and services that we automatically instrument in service maps, you'll usually see complete and detailed data for those nodes in the distributed tracing UI. However, you may notice that some of these services or applications are missing from service maps. Tip Some browser apps are exceptions to this, and may be missing because: Relationships for copy and paste browser agents are not detected. Only the relationships for injected browser agents is shown (the app the agent is injected into). Call relationships (for example, AJAX calling to other apps) are not displayed. If services or apps are missing, you may want to implement custom instrumentation of applications or specific transactions to see more detail in traces. Some examples of when you may need to do this: Transactions not automatically instrumented. To ensure your application is automatically instrumented, read the compatibility and requirements documentation for the agent you're using. If an application isn't automatically instrumented, or if you'd like to add instrumentation of specific activity, see Custom instrumentation. All Go applications. The Go agent, unlike other agents, requires manual instrumentation of your code. For instructions, see Instrument a Go application. A service doesn't use HTTP. If a service doesn't communicate via HTTP, the agent won't send distributed tracing headers. This may be the case for some non-web applications or message queues. To remedy this, use the distributed tracing APIs to instrument either the calling or called application.",

      "body": "Here is information about using the legacy APM service maps feature to create, customize, and use service maps. For help using the current service maps feature, see How to use service maps. Requirements The legacy service map features in APM depend on your New Relic agent version: Feature Requirements App visibility For your app to appear in service maps, one of the following must be true: Your app must have the minimum agent version required for distributed tracing and have distributed tracing enabled. Note: Mobile monitoring doesn't support distributed tracing yet and will not show relationships to apps that have distributed tracing enabled. Your app must have the minimum APM agent version required for cross app tracing and have cross app tracing enabled. Host and instance visibility To view specific hosts, instances, and types of database information, your agent must meet the same minimum agent versions as the APM database and instance feature and use any of the compatible database drivers. Database-only visibility APM's service maps feature includes the ability to opt out of the deeper, host and instance level view. However, to view databases in service maps without the instance-level details, you must still meet the same minimum agent versions as the Database and slow queries features. Create maps The APM service maps feature helps you create your first map by providing default map or architecture suggestions that automatically build a default map (if you have more than ten reporting apps). To view these suggested maps, go to one.newrelic.com > More > Service Maps > Suggested maps. To create a new map: Do one of the following: Start from scratch: Go to one.newrelic.com > More > Service maps > Map list > Create new map . Copy an existing map: Go to one.newrelic.com > More > Service maps > (select a map) > Save as new. Name your map. Rearrange, group, or add nodes on the map as needed. Important Previously, you could have private service maps. Now, all users can view, edit, and delete all existing or new service maps in the account. Save and rename maps Here are some tips about saving and renaming maps: Save To save changes to a map, select Save. To create a copy of the current map, select Save as new. Rename To rename a map: Go to one.newrelic.com > More > Service maps > (select a map). Select the pencil icon next to the map name. Change the name, then select Save. Add or remove nodes on maps After you create or save a map, build out your map by adding nodes to it. Nodes are added to the map differently based on the node type. To remove any node from the map, mouse over the node, then select the remove X icon. Applications and mobile apps Nodes for applications or mobile apps need to be added to the map in order to add any other nodes. Nodes are added and connected into the map as you select them. The check mark icon means that node is already on the map. To add apps to the map: Go to one.newrelic.com > More > Service maps > (select a map) > App/Service. Select any applications from the App/Service list. Rearrange or group together as needed. Browser, databases, external services, connected apps In the New Relic UI, your out-of-process services are referred to as web external or background external data. To add browser apps, databases, external services, or other connected apps to the map: Select an incoming or outgoing connection widget. From the list of connections, mouse over an app or service, then select the plus icon. Rearrange as needed. Custom nodes To add a custom node to the map: Go to one.newrelic.com > More > Service maps > (select a map) > App/Service. From the App/Service list, select Create custom node. Name the node. Add connections: Select the left (for incoming) or right (for outgoing) arrow icons. Then select the plus icon on your target node. Select Save. Rearrange as needed. To add or remove custom node connections: Mouse over the custom node and select the pencil icon. Select the left (for incoming) or right (for outgoing) arrow icons. To add a connection, select the plus icon. To remove a connection, select the minus icon. Select Save. Move around the map Move around the map by panning or zooming in and out. If you want to... Do this... Pan the map In pan mode, click and drag. In drag-select mode, hold the Alt key, then click and drag. Zoom in and out In either mode, zoom in and out by scrolling the mouse wheel. View your entire map in traffic light mode Zoom out until node details fade out and are replaced by health status colors. Toggle the traffic light view on and off Select Views, then select Traffic light mode. View all the nodes and their dependencies Select Discover your environment. Drill down into more detail from a node Use standard UI functions. Select, arrange, group nodes Click on a node to select it and view its performance summary. You can also select multiple nodes at once, to group and ungroup them: Select nodes To select one node, click on the node. To select multiple nodes: Click the drag-select icon to switch to drag-select mode. Click and drag the mouse to draw a square around the nodes you want to select. OR Hold the Shift key and click on each node you want to select. Arrange nodes Caution Auto-arrange cannot be undone. Consider saving a copy of your map first. To arrange nodes on the map, select one or more node, then drag to a snap point on the map. To automatically organize all your nodes and connections, select Auto-arrange map. Group and ungroup nodes If you want to... Do this... Group nodes together on the map Select two or more nodes, then select Create group. Name your new group Mouse over the group, then select the pencil icon. Rename an existing group Select the pencil icon. Remove nodes from a group Select the group, then select the minus icon for each item you want to remove. Add maps and charts to dashboards one.newrelic.com > Dashboards: adding a service map to a dashboard provides context for the data being reported and where it's coming from. You can add legacy service maps to a dashboard. For example, if you have a dashboard showcasing performance metrics for several entities, adding a service map to the dashboard shows how all the entities are related and provides additional context about your system. To add a service map to a dashboard: Go to one.newrelic.com and select the Explorer. Select an entity from the index. Click on Service map. Click Add to dashboard. Search for the dashboard you want to add the map to. Delete maps To delete a map: Go to one.newrelic.com > More > Service maps > (select a map). Select the map name's pencil icon. Select Delete map. Identify issues with external services If your app connects to an external service that New Relic does not monitor (for example, a third-party API), New Relic watches the service for a week in order to baseline its response time. If New Relic can collect a statistically significant number of data points (more than 100), New Relic compares the current response time to this baseline and uses this to set the health status indicator: Green: Response time from the service is less than 1.75 times the baseline. Yellow: Response time from the service is longer than 1.75 times the baseline. Red: Response time from the service is longer than 2.5 times the baseline. Gray: Alerts concluded it does not have enough data to determine the health status. Purple: Alerts cannot yet conclude if it has enough data to determine the health status. Visualize and monitor complex architectures Use service maps to visualize and monitor complex architectures. For a tutorial introducing the latest features, select the service map's question icon. Nodes Nodes are the basic building blocks for your map. You can add a variety of node types including: Node type Description New Relic APM-monitored app Add your app to the map to view their connections to databases, browser apps, out-of-process services, and other instrumented apps. (In the New Relic UI, your out-of-process services are also referred to as web external or background external data.) Browser apps Automatically detected for each app and added via the incoming connections widget. Only displays browser apps linked to an APM app (standalone browser apps are not supported). New Relic mobile monitoring apps Automatically detected and added via the app/service list panel. External services Service maps automatically detects external services (visible in the connections widget), to track your app's external dependencies and monitor the health of those connections. Custom nodes Add custom nodes via the app/service list panel to include apps and services not automatically instrumented by New Relic (for example, load balancers, implementation planning, and so on). Group nodes A group node contains multiple other nodes. For apps, group nodes include a summarized health status indicator for all nodes in the group. Node arrangement and grouping Click and drag a node to move it around the map, for a customizable view of your architecture. App nodes can also be grouped together into a single node to better organize related apps and services. Grouped nodes include summarized health status indicator for all nodes in the group. To remove items from a group, mouse over the group and select the pencil pencil icon, then select the minus minus-circle icon to remove the item from the group. Incoming and outgoing connections Service maps automatically detects incoming and outgoing connections based on HTTP calls between entities. Mouse over a node to highlight the node's connections. Widgets at the end of each node display a count of that node's connections, and you can click on those widgets to add related entities to the map: View performance summary Click on an app to view its performance over the last 30 minutes. The chart defaults to Response time, but you can view other metrics by selecting any of the available Apdex, Throughput, or Error rate links. While charts use the last 30 minutes of performance data, the service map as a whole is based on the last five minutes. View the app in APM or browser and view its labels by selecting the overflow ellipsis-v icon. Click the app name again to hide the summary charts, and select the overflow ellipsis-h icon again to hide other details. Map list and app/service list panels Select the Map list panel to: Search for and view your maps, and access other users' shared maps. Create a new map. Select the App/Service List panel to: Add new apps and mobile apps to your map. Create custom nodes and add them to the map. Health status and performance metrics You can see health status indicators for most nodes. Except for out-of-process services (external services or background services), entities use the health status indicators used by New Relic Alerts. For out-of-process (external) services, the health status indicator measures the health of the connection to the external service. View all connected apps and services The Discover your environment feature allows you to view all of your apps, services, and dependencies together with a single click. This feature detects all connected applications and services (including externals and databases) to give you a comprehensive view of your overall software architecture environment. To view all connected apps and services: In APM, select Service maps. From your Map list, select Discover your environment to display all of your nodes. Hover over any node to view its dependencies and how it connects to other parts of your service map. Click on individual nodes to zoom in and view their details. The Discover your environment feature may not be available if you are using an older New Relic agent version. See Troubleshooting cross application tracing for version information. This feature may also not be available for highly complex service maps with many elements. Go to one.newrelic.com > More > Service maps > Map list > Discover your environment: Use this option to view all of your nodes and their dependencies in one place. Traffic light mode Traffic light mode lets you view the health status of your entire architecture at a glance. This feature helps you quickly find service and app problems, even within a complex environment with many nodes. To toggle this mode, select the Views tab, then select Traffic light mode. When traffic lights mode is On, zooming out far enough on a service map eventually causes the nodes to switch from displaying textual information, to only health status colors. Click on individual nodes to zoom in and view more details. Traffic light mode is on by default. When traffic lights mode is Off, service map nodes retain their textual information and do not switch to health status colors, No matter how far you zoom out. one.newrelic.com > More > Service maps > Views > Traffic light mode: When traffic light mode is enabled, zooming out of your service map displays nodes in health status colors. Midnight mode Midnight mode inverts the screen's colors, going from a white background to a dark background. Midnight mode reduces eye strain, especially in low light environments. To toggle this mode, select the Views tab, then select Midnight mode.",

Service maps helps you visualize dependencies quickly and easily across your environment. They help you see how all your entities work together across your system. You can use service maps to troubleshoot problems, see how your environment works together, and ensure that issues don’t have downstream repercussions. Service maps also supports cross-account access so help you see relationships between entities for all your accounts. Requirements Service maps work with distributed tracing to connect relationships between entities. Service maps are still functional if you have not enabled distributed tracing, but we recommend having distributed tracing enabled for all agents. This ensures a more consistent experience while using service maps. For best results, update existing agents to the latest version. The required minimum agent versions for maps are: Minimum versions when distributed tracing is enabled The required minimum agent versions for maps using distributed tracing are: C SDK 1.1.0 or higher Go agent 2.1.0 or higher Java agent 4.3.0 or higher .NET agent 8.6.45.0 or higher Node.js agent 4.7.0 or higher PHP agent 8.4 or higher Python agent 4.2.0.100 or higher Ruby agent 5.3.0.346 or higher Minimum versions when distributed tracing is NOT enabled The minimum version requirements for maps not using distributed tracing are: C SDK: not available Go 1.11 or higher Java 3.9.0 or higher .NET 4.2 or higher Node.js 2.0.0 or higher PHP 4.19.0 or higher Python 2.38.0.31 or higher Ruby 4.3.0 or higher Add or remove connections to an entity To view service maps, from one.newrelic.com click Explorer. Once you select an entity to view, you can select service maps from the sidebar. The map shows your upstream and downstream services: entities toward the left are upstream, entities toward the right are downstream. To add or remove connections to an entity: Hover over the entity in the map that you want to alter. Click add or remove more connections. In the connection list, keep boxes checked for the entities that you want to appear in the map. Unchecked entities will be removed from the map. Color coded for alerts Each entity in a map displays a color dependent on its performance. Green: there are currently no violations for this entities performance. Yellow: there is an open warning violation for this entity. Red: there is an open critical violation for this entity. Gray: no alert conditions have been set for the entity White: agent not reporting. This means that the agent installed on the entity is not reporting any data. This is expected behavior for databases or externals. Understand dependencies using API You can discover the same relationship connections available in service maps with NerdGraph. For more information and examples, see the NerdGraph GraphiQL relationships API tutorial. Externals and databases in maps In the New Relic UI, your out-of-process services are referred to as web external or background external data. Externals and databases have slightly different features in service maps than other entity types: Unlike other entities that appear in service maps, externals are aggregates. Clicking on an external service in the map shows you the list of all the external services that are rolled up into the one external entity. This is to reduce map clutter, as some entities can have dozens of externals being reported. Databases are agentless. Because of this, alerts cannot be set for the database, as only see the service call is reported to New Relic.

      "body": "Problem When using service maps, you can't view the full set of entities or the relationships between entities that you expect to see. Solution Make sure that the entities are being monitored with an agent. If you have a mix of agents with some having distributed tracing turned on and some having it turned off, you will not see the relations between those agents. The solution for this scenario is to run all agents either with distributed tracing turned on (preferred) or turn it off for all agents. If this does not remedy the issue, the service you're trying to view may require manual instrumentation. When you view applications and services that we automatically instrument in service maps, you'll usually see complete and detailed data for those nodes in the distributed tracing UI. However, you may notice that some of these services or applications are missing from service maps. Tip Some browser apps are exceptions to this, and may be missing because: Relationships for copy and paste browser agents are not detected. Only the relationships for injected browser agents is shown (the app the agent is injected into). Call relationships (for example, AJAX calling to other apps) are not displayed. If services or apps are missing, you may want to implement custom instrumentation of applications or specific transactions to see more detail in traces. Some examples of when you may need to do this: Transactions not automatically instrumented. To ensure your application is automatically instrumented, read the compatibility and requirements documentation for the agent you're using. If an application isn't automatically instrumented, or if you'd like to add instrumentation of specific activity, see Custom instrumentation. All Go applications. The Go agent, unlike other agents, requires manual instrumentation of your code. For instructions, see Instrument a Go application. A service doesn't use HTTP. If a service doesn't communicate via HTTP, the agent won't send distributed tracing headers. This may be the case for some non-web applications or message queues. To remedy this, use the distributed tracing APIs to instrument either the calling or called application.",

Gray: no alert conditions have been set for the entity White: agent not reporting. This means that the agent installed on the entity is not reporting any data. This is expected behavior for databases or externals. Understand dependencies using API You can discover the same relationship connections available in service maps with NerdGraph. For more information and examples, see the NerdGraph GraphiQL relationships API tutorial. Externals and databases in maps In the New Relic UI, your out-of-process services are referred to as web external or background external data. Externals and databases have slightly different features in service maps than other entity types: Unlike other entities that appear in service maps, externals are aggregates. Clicking on an external service in the map shows you the list of all the external services that are rolled up into the one external entity. This is to reduce map clutter, as some entities can have dozens of externals being reported. Databases are agentless. Because of this, alerts cannot be set for the database, as only see the service call is reported to New Relic. Missing nodes If you are unable to view certain entities in New Relic One service maps, see Troubleshooting: Missing or obfuscated data in New Relic One.",

Maps automatically show your app's connections and dependencies, including applications, databases, hosts, servers, and out-of-process services. Tip In the New Relic UI, your out-of-process services are referred to as web external or background external data. Health indicators and performance metrics show you the current operational status for every part of your architecture. Service maps help you: Understand how apps and services in your architecture connect and communicate. Quickly see the current health and operational state of your entire environment. Troubleshoot operational issues and understand the impact of problems down to the host and instance level. Collaborate and drive shared understanding of an architecture. Access service maps Two options are available in New Relic One: the current service maps and the legacy APM service maps. To access the different service maps: Type To view maps Purpose Current service maps Go to one.newrelic.com > Explorer > (select an entity) > Monitor > Service map Service maps give you increased access to all the entities across your accounts, and help you understand how your entire environment is connected. Legacy APM service maps Go to one.newrelic.com > More > Service maps Legacy APM service maps let you create, customize, and share maps related to an individual app. Identify operational issues Service maps are color-coded to provide a quick look at the current status of your environment. Select nodes on a map to view additional performance metrics, and a full list and health check of each node's connections. The map automatically connects nodes into the map, so you can see which apps on the map connect to others. This helps you troubleshoot and assess the impact of a performance problem between a calling application and a specific database. With service maps, you can view your service and its status in the context of its up and downstream dependencies. Use maps in New Relic One to identify the root cause when troubleshooting an incident.

      "body": "Problem When using service maps, you can't view the full set of entities or the relationships between entities that you expect to see. Solution Make sure that the entities are being monitored with an agent. If you have a mix of agents with some having distributed tracing turned on and some having it turned off, you will not see the relations between those agents. The solution for this scenario is to run all agents either with distributed tracing turned on (preferred) or turn it off for all agents. If this does not remedy the issue, the service you're trying to view may require manual instrumentation. When you view applications and services that we automatically instrument in service maps, you'll usually see complete and detailed data for those nodes in the distributed tracing UI. However, you may notice that some of these services or applications are missing from service maps. Tip Some browser apps are exceptions to this, and may be missing because: Relationships for copy and paste browser agents are not detected. Only the relationships for injected browser agents is shown (the app the agent is injected into). Call relationships (for example, AJAX calling to other apps) are not displayed. If services or apps are missing, you may want to implement custom instrumentation of applications or specific transactions to see more detail in traces. Some examples of when you may need to do this: Transactions not automatically instrumented. To ensure your application is automatically instrumented, read the compatibility and requirements documentation for the agent you're using. If an application isn't automatically instrumented, or if you'd like to add instrumentation of specific activity, see Custom instrumentation. All Go applications. The Go agent, unlike other agents, requires manual instrumentation of your code. For instructions, see Instrument a Go application. A service doesn't use HTTP. If a service doesn't communicate via HTTP, the agent won't send distributed tracing headers. This may be the case for some non-web applications or message queues. To remedy this, use the distributed tracing APIs to instrument either the calling or called application.",

      "body": "Here is information about using the legacy APM service maps feature to create, customize, and use service maps. For help using the current service maps feature, see How to use service maps. Requirements The legacy service map features in APM depend on your New Relic agent version: Feature Requirements App visibility For your app to appear in service maps, one of the following must be true: Your app must have the minimum agent version required for distributed tracing and have distributed tracing enabled. Note: Mobile monitoring doesn't support distributed tracing yet and will not show relationships to apps that have distributed tracing enabled. Your app must have the minimum APM agent version required for cross app tracing and have cross app tracing enabled. Host and instance visibility To view specific hosts, instances, and types of database information, your agent must meet the same minimum agent versions as the APM database and instance feature and use any of the compatible database drivers. Database-only visibility APM's service maps feature includes the ability to opt out of the deeper, host and instance level view. However, to view databases in service maps without the instance-level details, you must still meet the same minimum agent versions as the Database and slow queries features. Create maps The APM service maps feature helps you create your first map by providing default map or architecture suggestions that automatically build a default map (if you have more than ten reporting apps). To view these suggested maps, go to one.newrelic.com > More > Service Maps > Suggested maps. To create a new map: Do one of the following: Start from scratch: Go to one.newrelic.com > More > Service maps > Map list > Create new map . Copy an existing map: Go to one.newrelic.com > More > Service maps > (select a map) > Save as new. Name your map. Rearrange, group, or add nodes on the map as needed. Important Previously, you could have private service maps. Now, all users can view, edit, and delete all existing or new service maps in the account. Save and rename maps Here are some tips about saving and renaming maps: Save To save changes to a map, select Save. To create a copy of the current map, select Save as new. Rename To rename a map: Go to one.newrelic.com > More > Service maps > (select a map). Select the pencil icon next to the map name. Change the name, then select Save. Add or remove nodes on maps After you create or save a map, build out your map by adding nodes to it. Nodes are added to the map differently based on the node type. To remove any node from the map, mouse over the node, then select the remove X icon. Applications and mobile apps Nodes for applications or mobile apps need to be added to the map in order to add any other nodes. Nodes are added and connected into the map as you select them. The check mark icon means that node is already on the map. To add apps to the map: Go to one.newrelic.com > More > Service maps > (select a map) > App/Service. Select any applications from the App/Service list. Rearrange or group together as needed. Browser, databases, external services, connected apps In the New Relic UI, your out-of-process services are referred to as web external or background external data. To add browser apps, databases, external services, or other connected apps to the map: Select an incoming or outgoing connection widget. From the list of connections, mouse over an app or service, then select the plus icon. Rearrange as needed. Custom nodes To add a custom node to the map: Go to one.newrelic.com > More > Service maps > (select a map) > App/Service. From the App/Service list, select Create custom node. Name the node. Add connections: Select the left (for incoming) or right (for outgoing) arrow icons. Then select the plus icon on your target node. Select Save. Rearrange as needed. To add or remove custom node connections: Mouse over the custom node and select the pencil icon. Select the left (for incoming) or right (for outgoing) arrow icons. To add a connection, select the plus icon. To remove a connection, select the minus icon. Select Save. Move around the map Move around the map by panning or zooming in and out. If you want to... Do this... Pan the map In pan mode, click and drag. In drag-select mode, hold the Alt key, then click and drag. Zoom in and out In either mode, zoom in and out by scrolling the mouse wheel. View your entire map in traffic light mode Zoom out until node details fade out and are replaced by health status colors. Toggle the traffic light view on and off Select Views, then select Traffic light mode. View all the nodes and their dependencies Select Discover your environment. Drill down into more detail from a node Use standard UI functions. Select, arrange, group nodes Click on a node to select it and view its performance summary. You can also select multiple nodes at once, to group and ungroup them: Select nodes To select one node, click on the node. To select multiple nodes: Click the drag-select icon to switch to drag-select mode. Click and drag the mouse to draw a square around the nodes you want to select. OR Hold the Shift key and click on each node you want to select. Arrange nodes Caution Auto-arrange cannot be undone. Consider saving a copy of your map first. To arrange nodes on the map, select one or more node, then drag to a snap point on the map. To automatically organize all your nodes and connections, select Auto-arrange map. Group and ungroup nodes If you want to... Do this... Group nodes together on the map Select two or more nodes, then select Create group. Name your new group Mouse over the group, then select the pencil icon. Rename an existing group Select the pencil icon. Remove nodes from a group Select the group, then select the minus icon for each item you want to remove. Add maps and charts to dashboards one.newrelic.com > Dashboards: adding a service map to a dashboard provides context for the data being reported and where it's coming from. You can add legacy service maps to a dashboard. For example, if you have a dashboard showcasing performance metrics for several entities, adding a service map to the dashboard shows how all the entities are related and provides additional context about your system. To add a service map to a dashboard: Go to one.newrelic.com and select the Explorer. Select an entity from the index. Click on Service map. Click Add to dashboard. Search for the dashboard you want to add the map to. Delete maps To delete a map: Go to one.newrelic.com > More > Service maps > (select a map). Select the map name's pencil icon. Select Delete map. Identify issues with external services If your app connects to an external service that New Relic does not monitor (for example, a third-party API), New Relic watches the service for a week in order to baseline its response time. If New Relic can collect a statistically significant number of data points (more than 100), New Relic compares the current response time to this baseline and uses this to set the health status indicator: Green: Response time from the service is less than 1.75 times the baseline. Yellow: Response time from the service is longer than 1.75 times the baseline. Red: Response time from the service is longer than 2.5 times the baseline. Gray: Alerts concluded it does not have enough data to determine the health status. Purple: Alerts cannot yet conclude if it has enough data to determine the health status. Visualize and monitor complex architectures Use service maps to visualize and monitor complex architectures. For a tutorial introducing the latest features, select the service map's question icon. Nodes Nodes are the basic building blocks for your map. You can add a variety of node types including: Node type Description New Relic APM-monitored app Add your app to the map to view their connections to databases, browser apps, out-of-process services, and other instrumented apps. (In the New Relic UI, your out-of-process services are also referred to as web external or background external data.) Browser apps Automatically detected for each app and added via the incoming connections widget. Only displays browser apps linked to an APM app (standalone browser apps are not supported). New Relic mobile monitoring apps Automatically detected and added via the app/service list panel. External services Service maps automatically detects external services (visible in the connections widget), to track your app's external dependencies and monitor the health of those connections. Custom nodes Add custom nodes via the app/service list panel to include apps and services not automatically instrumented by New Relic (for example, load balancers, implementation planning, and so on). Group nodes A group node contains multiple other nodes. For apps, group nodes include a summarized health status indicator for all nodes in the group. Node arrangement and grouping Click and drag a node to move it around the map, for a customizable view of your architecture. App nodes can also be grouped together into a single node to better organize related apps and services. Grouped nodes include summarized health status indicator for all nodes in the group. To remove items from a group, mouse over the group and select the pencil pencil icon, then select the minus minus-circle icon to remove the item from the group. Incoming and outgoing connections Service maps automatically detects incoming and outgoing connections based on HTTP calls between entities. Mouse over a node to highlight the node's connections. Widgets at the end of each node display a count of that node's connections, and you can click on those widgets to add related entities to the map: View performance summary Click on an app to view its performance over the last 30 minutes. The chart defaults to Response time, but you can view other metrics by selecting any of the available Apdex, Throughput, or Error rate links. While charts use the last 30 minutes of performance data, the service map as a whole is based on the last five minutes. View the app in APM or browser and view its labels by selecting the overflow ellipsis-v icon. Click the app name again to hide the summary charts, and select the overflow ellipsis-h icon again to hide other details. Map list and app/service list panels Select the Map list panel to: Search for and view your maps, and access other users' shared maps. Create a new map. Select the App/Service List panel to: Add new apps and mobile apps to your map. Create custom nodes and add them to the map. Health status and performance metrics You can see health status indicators for most nodes. Except for out-of-process services (external services or background services), entities use the health status indicators used by New Relic Alerts. For out-of-process (external) services, the health status indicator measures the health of the connection to the external service. View all connected apps and services The Discover your environment feature allows you to view all of your apps, services, and dependencies together with a single click. This feature detects all connected applications and services (including externals and databases) to give you a comprehensive view of your overall software architecture environment. To view all connected apps and services: In APM, select Service maps. From your Map list, select Discover your environment to display all of your nodes. Hover over any node to view its dependencies and how it connects to other parts of your service map. Click on individual nodes to zoom in and view their details. The Discover your environment feature may not be available if you are using an older New Relic agent version. See Troubleshooting cross application tracing for version information. This feature may also not be available for highly complex service maps with many elements. Go to one.newrelic.com > More > Service maps > Map list > Discover your environment: Use this option to view all of your nodes and their dependencies in one place. Traffic light mode Traffic light mode lets you view the health status of your entire architecture at a glance. This feature helps you quickly find service and app problems, even within a complex environment with many nodes. To toggle this mode, select the Views tab, then select Traffic light mode. When traffic lights mode is On, zooming out far enough on a service map eventually causes the nodes to switch from displaying textual information, to only health status colors. Click on individual nodes to zoom in and view more details. Traffic light mode is on by default. When traffic lights mode is Off, service map nodes retain their textual information and do not switch to health status colors, No matter how far you zoom out. one.newrelic.com > More > Service maps > Views > Traffic light mode: When traffic light mode is enabled, zooming out of your service map displays nodes in health status colors. Midnight mode Midnight mode inverts the screen's colors, going from a white background to a dark background. Midnight mode reduces eye strain, especially in low light environments. To toggle this mode, select the Views tab, then select Midnight mode.",

Service maps helps you visualize dependencies quickly and easily across your environment. They help you see how all your entities work together across your system. You can use service maps to troubleshoot problems, see how your environment works together, and ensure that issues don’t have downstream repercussions. Service maps also supports cross-account access so help you see relationships between entities for all your accounts. Requirements Service maps work with distributed tracing to connect relationships between entities. Service maps are still functional if you have not enabled distributed tracing, but we recommend having distributed tracing enabled for all agents. This ensures a more consistent experience while using service maps. For best results, update existing agents to the latest version. The required minimum agent versions for maps are: Minimum versions when distributed tracing is enabled The required minimum agent versions for maps using distributed tracing are: C SDK 1.1.0 or higher Go agent 2.1.0 or higher Java agent 4.3.0 or higher .NET agent 8.6.45.0 or higher Node.js agent 4.7.0 or higher PHP agent 8.4 or higher Python agent 4.2.0.100 or higher Ruby agent 5.3.0.346 or higher Minimum versions when distributed tracing is NOT enabled The minimum version requirements for maps not using distributed tracing are: C SDK: not available Go 1.11 or higher Java 3.9.0 or higher .NET 4.2 or higher Node.js 2.0.0 or higher PHP 4.19.0 or higher Python 2.38.0.31 or higher Ruby 4.3.0 or higher Add or remove connections to an entity To view service maps, from one.newrelic.com click Explorer. Once you select an entity to view, you can select service maps from the sidebar. The map shows your upstream and downstream services: entities toward the left are upstream, entities toward the right are downstream. To add or remove connections to an entity: Hover over the entity in the map that you want to alter. Click add or remove more connections. In the connection list, keep boxes checked for the entities that you want to appear in the map. Unchecked entities will be removed from the map. Color coded for alerts Each entity in a map displays a color dependent on its performance. Green: there are currently no violations for this entities performance. Yellow: there is an open warning violation for this entity. Red: there is an open critical violation for this entity. Gray: no alert conditions have been set for the entity White: agent not reporting. This means that the agent installed on the entity is not reporting any data. This is expected behavior for databases or externals. Understand dependencies using API You can discover the same relationship connections available in service maps with NerdGraph. For more information and examples, see the NerdGraph GraphiQL relationships API tutorial. Externals and databases in maps In the New Relic UI, your out-of-process services are referred to as web external or background external data. Externals and databases have slightly different features in service maps than other entity types: Unlike other entities that appear in service maps, externals are aggregates. Clicking on an external service in the map shows you the list of all the external services that are rolled up into the one external entity. This is to reduce map clutter, as some entities can have dozens of externals being reported. Databases are agentless. Because of this, alerts cannot be set for the database, as only see the service call is reported to New Relic. Missing nodes If you are unable to view certain entities in New Relic One service maps, see Troubleshooting: Missing or obfuscated data in New Relic One.",

Maps automatically show your app's connections and dependencies, including applications, databases, hosts, servers, and out-of-process services. Tip In the New Relic UI, your out-of-process services are referred to as web external or background external data. Health indicators and performance metrics show you the current operational status for every part of your architecture. Service maps help you: Understand how apps and services in your architecture connect and communicate. Quickly see the current health and operational state of your entire environment. Troubleshoot operational issues and understand the impact of problems down to the host and instance level. Collaborate and drive shared understanding of an architecture. Access service maps Two options are available in New Relic One: the current service maps and the legacy APM service maps. To access the different service maps: Type To view maps Purpose Current service maps Go to one.newrelic.com > Explorer > (select an entity) > Monitor > Service map Service maps give you increased access to all the entities across your accounts, and help you understand how your entire environment is connected. Legacy APM service maps Go to one.newrelic.com > More > Service maps Legacy APM service maps let you create, customize, and share maps related to an individual app. Identify operational issues Service maps are color-coded to provide a quick look at the current status of your environment. Select nodes on a map to view additional performance metrics, and a full list and health check of each node's connections. The map automatically connects nodes into the map, so you can see which apps on the map connect to others. This helps you troubleshoot and assess the impact of a performance problem between a calling application and a specific database. With service maps, you can view your service and its status in the context of its up and downstream dependencies. Use maps in New Relic One to identify the root cause when troubleshooting an incident.

For more information on this issue, see Metric grouping issues (MGIs). To reduce high cardinality and prevent metric grouping issues, New Relic supports rules for grouping or filtering out metrics (normalization). In some cases, when MGIs with a significant high number of metrics are detected, a rule is created automatically to protect the platform from performance degradation. Metric normalization rules management You can create and manage new rules that deal with the noise produced from high cardinality metrics by using the metric normalization tool, which is accessible from each service dashboard in the New Relic Explorer. Once there, select Metric Normalization in the left sidebar. There you can see the existing rules or create new ones. Click a rule to modify it, or click Create a new rule to create a new one. A new pane to configure the rule will be displayed. Available fields are: Match expression: enter the regular expression to group all the metrics you want to include in the rule. Matches: here you will see a preview of the metrics matched by the regular expression above. Action: the action you want to perform on the metrics. Replace: replace the matched metrics by the regular expression with the value described in the Replacement field. Ignore: ignore any metric that matches the regular expression. Deny new metrics: only write metrics that have already been reported, and ignore those that match the regular expression. Replacement: only active when Replace is enabled. Matched metrics are replaced with the field's value. If the regular expression is capturing groups, you can use placeholders for them with \\1 or \\2 for the groups 1 and 2 respectively. Active: rules can’t be deleted, but can be deactivated. Click the toggle to enable or disable the rule. If you want the rule to be removed, reach out to New Relic's support. Terminate: When enabled, the rules waterfall is exited when the associated pattern is matched. Notes: internal notes on the rule. Has no effect on the rule.

      "body": "In the software industry, a tag typically refers to a piece of metadata added to a data set for the purpose of improving data organization and findability. At New Relic, our tags are key:value pairs (like team: operations) added to various sets of data, like monitored apps and hosts, agents, dashboards, and workloads. We make some important attributes available as tags (for example, app metadata like app name and language, and host metadata like host name and AWS region). You can also add your own custom tags. You can use tags in the UI to filter down to relevant data. Here is an example: Here you can see an accountId tag being used to filter workloads to a specific account. Tags help you to: Organize data coming from a large number of sources and/or to a large number of New Relic accounts. Identify teams, roles, environments, or regions to know who’s responsible for what (see example use cases). Better organize and search dashboards and workloads. Query and chart APM data. Tags are useful for organizing data at a high level. If you want to add more fine-grained detail, like capturing user names or other high-cardinality values, custom attributes or custom events are a better solution. Tip Tags were previously called labels in the New Relic UI. You may sometimes see labelin our code; for example, some of our APM agent config files use a label config option for tags. Tag format and limits Format requirements and limits for tags: The UI has limits on the total number of tags it can display per entity: Limit of 100 for tags reported by default or added via agent/integration configuration. Limit of 100 for custom tags added via UI or API. The following are maximum character length for tags: Key: 128 characters Value: 256 characters When using our API to add tags, a dash (-) in a tag key is interpreted as a minus symbol. If your tag key has a dash, use back ticks around it (like `key-name`). Best practices and tips Before adding tags, we recommend first seeing how our default tags work for you. When you're ready to add your own tags, review the following best practices tips to get the most out of them. Tips on keeping tags simple: Start by adding only tags you know you’ll definitely use. Unused tags create noise and may add confusion. Try to use short tags. Shorter tags are easier to parse, and also the UI may sometimes truncate longer tags. (See character limits.) When possible, use keys and values that are human-readable (for example, region: EMEA is better than Param8323 : 1229072). Avoid including several values like regions: EMEA | US | LATAM in a single tag. We recommend using three different tags for that, like region: emea, region: us, and region: latam. If you want to match multiple tags, you can do that using the advanced options in the filter UI. Tips on using tags consistently: Try to be consistent with tag language across your teams and entities. Be consistent with naming. For example, avoid using both region: emea and reg: emea. Be consistent with format. For example, avoid using both camelCase and kebab-case. Although tag searching is not case-sensitive in the UI and API, try to be consistent with capitalization. For example, avoid using both env: staging and env: Staging. Tips on cross-team implementation: Tags help improve observability and cost allocation. For this reason, responsibility for tag implementation is often assigned to an observability team, SREs, a group of architects, or a cross-team task force. We recommend the people responsible for implementing tags meet and create an internal policy to describe how the tags are defined and which conventions are to be used. Then: Keep this reference manual up to date. Automate the definition of tags when you deploy New Relic agents, at the cloud provider, or through New Relic automation tools, such as the API or Terraform. Create recurring reports that identify entities that are non-compliant with your tagging standards. Tag examples Here are some examples of common ways to use tags to organize data: Team-related tags Creating tags for team names can be helpful to understand which team, group, department, or region was responsible for a change that led to a performance issue. Team examples: team: backend team: frontend team: db Role examples: roles: architecture roles: devops roles: pm Region examples: region: emea region: america region: asia Environment-related tags You can create entities for the environment they belong to. Examples: env: production env: qa env: development env: staging Criticality-related tags You can create tags related to criticality levels, which lets you easier track the most critical issues. Examples: layer: level1 layer: level2 layer: level3 How tags are added Some important attributes, by default, are available for use as tags. For example, the account name, the account ID, and some basic host/server metadata are available as default tags. You can't remove these available-by-default tags. Here are some details about how tags are added for some specific data sources: Add tags via UI or API When you add tags via the UI or API, this occurs at the entity level. This means that, for example, if you have multiple APM agents monitoring a single entity and apply a tag via the UI, that tag is available for all data coming from that entity. To add or delete tags via the UI: Select a monitored entity, like a monitored app or host. Near the entity’s name at the top of the page, select the See metadata and manage tags menu. In the menu that pops up, add or delete a tag. For APM agents, restart your service. To manage tags via API: see our NerdGraph tagging docs. For a guide to using our CLI to automate tagging, see our developer site. APM agent tags You can add tags via the UI and API or you can add tags using APM agent configuration, both methods require you to restart your service. There are differences in how these apply tags: Via agent config: These tags are applied at the agent-level, not the entity/application level. This would be a good option if you have multiple agents monitoring different aspects of the same app (for example, a blue-green deployment model). Via the UI or API: These tags are applied at the entity/application level. Here are links to the agent configuration options: C SDK: not available Java Go .NET Node.js PHP Python Ruby For information on querying APM tags, see Query APM tags. And check out this short video on querying APM tags (3:20 minutes). Infrastructure data tags There are several ways tags are added to infrastructure entities and services: Use the UI or API to add tags at the entity level. Infrastructure agent: some attributes are available by default as tags. You can also add custom attributes, which are also available as tags in the UI. On-host integrations: some attributes are available by default as tags. You can also add tags by using integration-specific labels config options (for an example, see the labels config for the Apache integration). Cloud service integrations: by default we report tags and labels that are defined in the cloud service. To add tags, you'd add them on the cloud-service-side. Automate tags with our CLI For a guide to automating tags using our CLI tool, see our developer site. Use tags to filter the UI Use the filter field at the top of the New Relic Explorer to filter down to the entities you care about. You can use multiple filter conditions. To filter down to certain entities using tags: From one.newrelic.com, click Explorer. Click the Filter by... field to see a dropdown of available attributes and tags. You can filter by multiple elements and use advanced search options. To find an entity’s metadata and tags from the UI, here are two options: From a list of entities in the UI, at the far right, select an entity's icon. OR Select an entity. Near the top of the page, select the icon. To use the API to view tags, see our NerdGraph docs. Learn about how to use tags with dashboards and how to use tags with workloads. Custom queries, charts, and alerts Different features handle tags differently. Here are some details about how you can use NRQL to query tag data, or create NRQL condition alerts. Query and alert on APM tags You can query APM tags using NRQL. Minimum agent versions: C: not available Go: 2.3.0 Java: 4.9.0 .NET: 8.17 Node: v4.13.0 PHP: not available Python: v4.10.0.112 Ruby: 6.1.0.352 Here are some query examples: Throughput across shards Given a service that is distributed across nine shards, each shard assigned as an environment, we can plot the transaction throughput on all shards using a wildcard query like: SELECT rate(count(apm.service.transaction.duration), 1 minute) FROM Metric WHERE appName LIKE 'MyApp (%' AND transactionType = 'Other' FACET tags.Environment TIMESERIES Copy Transactions per team To see the number of transactions per service for a specific team, we might use a query like: FROM Transaction SELECT count(*) WHERE tags.Team = 'team-a' FACET tags.Project TIMESERIES Copy Alert on error rate for teams You can use a query for your services’ error rate for setting an alert without having to create a rule for each service. Here is the error rate for all services on a team called team-b. And this alert will automatically monitor any new app names added with the team tag. FROM Metric SELECT count(apm.service.error.count) / count(apm.service.transaction.duration) WHERE tags.Team = 'team-b' FACET appName Copy Related to this, you might create a general rule for a specific service deployed across several environments, so that we have an alarm for a single service monitoring each environment individually: From Metric SELECT count(apm.service.error.count) / count(apm.service.transaction.duration) WHERE tags.Project = 'MyProject' FACET tags.Environment Copy Query and alert on attributes As explained in the tag sources information, some important attributes are used as tags. You can query all attributes and create custom charts using NRQL, and create NRQL alert conditions.",

But if you want to skip ahead, just sign up for a New Relic account. (It's free, forever!) Then, after you install New Relic, you can start working with your data. Quickly understand context We provide multiple ways to understand your system's dependencies, so you can easily see how everything fits together and troubleshoot problems. New Relic One gives you and your teams a connected view that cuts through complexity! If you want to... Use this Have an overall view of your system, and drill down to get performance details. Use the New Relic Explorer as the front door to New Relic One. Observe, group, and filter the performance data from all your system's entities, including applications, services, hosts, and containers. Gain extensive visibility into each entity in your solution, its alert status, and how the entities are connected. Use the New Relic Navigator to give you a high density overview of all your entities so you can detect any issues at a glance. Use New Relic Lookout to spot entities recently experiencing deviations from expected behavior. Provide context for your entities. Use tags to illustrate relationships and contextual information for what you monitor. By thoughtfully tagging your entities, you can connect all the data your teams need to understand their increasingly complex and interdependent systems. For example: Add tags to all your entities. Create tags via API for teams and all the services they monitor. See how each part of your system is connected. Review service maps that illustrate your upstream and downstream dependencies. Visualize the aggregated health and activity data from all you monitor. Group and monitor any entities together into functional team-focused, project-focused groupings, or any other attribute, with workloads. Fetch and analyze specific data.

      "body": "There may be cases where an application sends many individual metrics that could be better managed in groups. Most of these occur with web transactions metrics named from URLs. For more information on this issue, see Metric grouping issues (MGIs). To reduce high cardinality and prevent metric grouping issues, New Relic supports rules for grouping or filtering out metrics (normalization). In some cases, when MGIs with a significant high number of metrics are detected, a rule is created automatically to protect the platform from performance degradation. Metric normalization rules management You can create and manage new rules that deal with the noise produced from high cardinality metrics by using the metric normalization tool, which is accessible from each service dashboard in the New Relic Explorer. Once there, select Metric Normalization in the left sidebar. There you can see the existing rules or create new ones. Click a rule to modify it, or click Create a new rule to create a new one. A new pane to configure the rule will be displayed. Available fields are: Match expression: enter the regular expression to group all the metrics you want to include in the rule. Matches: here you will see a preview of the metrics matched by the regular expression above. Action: the action you want to perform on the metrics. Replace: replace the matched metrics by the regular expression with the value described in the Replacement field. Ignore: ignore any metric that matches the regular expression. Deny new metrics: only write metrics that have already been reported, and ignore those that match the regular expression. Replacement: only active when Replace is enabled. Matched metrics are replaced with the field's value. If the regular expression is capturing groups, you can use placeholders for them with \\1 or \\2 for the groups 1 and 2 respectively. Active: rules can’t be deleted, but can be deactivated. Click the toggle to enable or disable the rule. If you want the rule to be removed, reach out to New Relic's support. Terminate: When enabled, the rules waterfall is exited when the associated pattern is matched. Notes: internal notes on the rule. Has no effect on the rule.

      "body": "In the software industry, a tag typically refers to a piece of metadata added to a data set for the purpose of improving data organization and findability. At New Relic, our tags are key:value pairs (like team: operations) added to various sets of data, like monitored apps and hosts, agents, dashboards, and workloads. We make some important attributes available as tags (for example, app metadata like app name and language, and host metadata like host name and AWS region). You can also add your own custom tags. You can use tags in the UI to filter down to relevant data. Here is an example: Here you can see an accountId tag being used to filter workloads to a specific account. Tags help you to: Organize data coming from a large number of sources and/or to a large number of New Relic accounts. Identify teams, roles, environments, or regions to know who’s responsible for what (see example use cases). Better organize and search dashboards and workloads. Query and chart APM data. Tags are useful for organizing data at a high level. If you want to add more fine-grained detail, like capturing user names or other high-cardinality values, custom attributes or custom events are a better solution. Tip Tags were previously called labels in the New Relic UI. You may sometimes see labelin our code; for example, some of our APM agent config files use a label config option for tags. Tag format and limits Format requirements and limits for tags: The UI has limits on the total number of tags it can display per entity: Limit of 100 for tags reported by default or added via agent/integration configuration. Limit of 100 for custom tags added via UI or API. The following are maximum character length for tags: Key: 128 characters Value: 256 characters When using our API to add tags, a dash (-) in a tag key is interpreted as a minus symbol. If your tag key has a dash, use back ticks around it (like `key-name`). Best practices and tips Before adding tags, we recommend first seeing how our default tags work for you. When you're ready to add your own tags, review the following best practices tips to get the most out of them. Tips on keeping tags simple: Start by adding only tags you know you’ll definitely use. Unused tags create noise and may add confusion. Try to use short tags. Shorter tags are easier to parse, and also the UI may sometimes truncate longer tags. (See character limits.) When possible, use keys and values that are human-readable (for example, region: EMEA is better than Param8323 : 1229072). Avoid including several values like regions: EMEA | US | LATAM in a single tag. We recommend using three different tags for that, like region: emea, region: us, and region: latam. If you want to match multiple tags, you can do that using the advanced options in the filter UI. Tips on using tags consistently: Try to be consistent with tag language across your teams and entities. Be consistent with naming. For example, avoid using both region: emea and reg: emea. Be consistent with format. For example, avoid using both camelCase and kebab-case. Although tag searching is not case-sensitive in the UI and API, try to be consistent with capitalization. For example, avoid using both env: staging and env: Staging. Tips on cross-team implementation: Tags help improve observability and cost allocation. For this reason, responsibility for tag implementation is often assigned to an observability team, SREs, a group of architects, or a cross-team task force. We recommend the people responsible for implementing tags meet and create an internal policy to describe how the tags are defined and which conventions are to be used. Then: Keep this reference manual up to date. Automate the definition of tags when you deploy New Relic agents, at the cloud provider, or through New Relic automation tools, such as the API or Terraform. Create recurring reports that identify entities that are non-compliant with your tagging standards. Tag examples Here are some examples of common ways to use tags to organize data: Team-related tags Creating tags for team names can be helpful to understand which team, group, department, or region was responsible for a change that led to a performance issue. Team examples: team: backend team: frontend team: db Role examples: roles: architecture roles: devops roles: pm Region examples: region: emea region: america region: asia Environment-related tags You can create entities for the environment they belong to. Examples: env: production env: qa env: development env: staging Criticality-related tags You can create tags related to criticality levels, which lets you easier track the most critical issues. Examples: layer: level1 layer: level2 layer: level3 How tags are added Some important attributes, by default, are available for use as tags. For example, the account name, the account ID, and some basic host/server metadata are available as default tags. You can't remove these available-by-default tags. Here are some details about how tags are added for some specific data sources: Add tags via UI or API When you add tags via the UI or API, this occurs at the entity level. This means that, for example, if you have multiple APM agents monitoring a single entity and apply a tag via the UI, that tag is available for all data coming from that entity. To add or delete tags via the UI: Select a monitored entity, like a monitored app or host. Near the entity’s name at the top of the page, select the See metadata and manage tags menu. In the menu that pops up, add or delete a tag. For APM agents, restart your service. To manage tags via API: see our NerdGraph tagging docs. For a guide to using our CLI to automate tagging, see our developer site. APM agent tags You can add tags via the UI and API or you can add tags using APM agent configuration, both methods require you to restart your service. There are differences in how these apply tags: Via agent config: These tags are applied at the agent-level, not the entity/application level. This would be a good option if you have multiple agents monitoring different aspects of the same app (for example, a blue-green deployment model). Via the UI or API: These tags are applied at the entity/application level. Here are links to the agent configuration options: C SDK: not available Java Go .NET Node.js PHP Python Ruby For information on querying APM tags, see Query APM tags. And check out this short video on querying APM tags (3:20 minutes). Infrastructure data tags There are several ways tags are added to infrastructure entities and services: Use the UI or API to add tags at the entity level. Infrastructure agent: some attributes are available by default as tags. You can also add custom attributes, which are also available as tags in the UI. On-host integrations: some attributes are available by default as tags. You can also add tags by using integration-specific labels config options (for an example, see the labels config for the Apache integration). Cloud service integrations: by default we report tags and labels that are defined in the cloud service. To add tags, you'd add them on the cloud-service-side. Automate tags with our CLI For a guide to automating tags using our CLI tool, see our developer site. Use tags to filter the UI Use the filter field at the top of the New Relic Explorer to filter down to the entities you care about. You can use multiple filter conditions. To filter down to certain entities using tags: From one.newrelic.com, click Explorer. Click the Filter by... field to see a dropdown of available attributes and tags. You can filter by multiple elements and use advanced search options. To find an entity’s metadata and tags from the UI, here are two options: From a list of entities in the UI, at the far right, select an entity's icon. OR Select an entity. Near the top of the page, select the icon. To use the API to view tags, see our NerdGraph docs. Learn about how to use tags with dashboards and how to use tags with workloads. Custom queries, charts, and alerts Different features handle tags differently. Here are some details about how you can use NRQL to query tag data, or create NRQL condition alerts. Query and alert on APM tags You can query APM tags using NRQL. Minimum agent versions: C: not available Go: 2.3.0 Java: 4.9.0 .NET: 8.17 Node: v4.13.0 PHP: not available Python: v4.10.0.112 Ruby: 6.1.0.352 Here are some query examples: Throughput across shards Given a service that is distributed across nine shards, each shard assigned as an environment, we can plot the transaction throughput on all shards using a wildcard query like: SELECT rate(count(apm.service.transaction.duration), 1 minute) FROM Metric WHERE appName LIKE 'MyApp (%' AND transactionType = 'Other' FACET tags.Environment TIMESERIES Copy Transactions per team To see the number of transactions per service for a specific team, we might use a query like: FROM Transaction SELECT count(*) WHERE tags.Team = 'team-a' FACET tags.Project TIMESERIES Copy Alert on error rate for teams You can use a query for your services’ error rate for setting an alert without having to create a rule for each service. Here is the error rate for all services on a team called team-b. And this alert will automatically monitor any new app names added with the team tag. FROM Metric SELECT count(apm.service.error.count) / count(apm.service.transaction.duration) WHERE tags.Team = 'team-b' FACET appName Copy Related to this, you might create a general rule for a specific service deployed across several environments, so that we have an alarm for a single service monitoring each environment individually: From Metric SELECT count(apm.service.error.count) / count(apm.service.transaction.duration) WHERE tags.Project = 'MyProject' FACET tags.Environment Copy Query and alert on attributes As explained in the tag sources information, some important attributes are used as tags. You can query all attributes and create custom charts using NRQL, and create NRQL alert conditions.",
